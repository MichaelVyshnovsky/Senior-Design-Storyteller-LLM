        "Effects": "This spell created a controlled gale that lifted dust from the surrounding area. The caster could create either a wall of dust or a swirling cloud. This spell was useful to blind enemies or conceal allies. If the caster's concentration was broken then the spell would end. The caster was able to move the wall or cloud around wherever they chose. Dust clouds could even be shaped into virtually any form.",
        "Components": "This spell required a handful of [[sand]] to cast."
