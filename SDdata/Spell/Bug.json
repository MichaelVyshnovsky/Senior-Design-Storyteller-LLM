It appeared at a spot within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}<ref group=\"note\">The original description of this spell in [[Dragon magazine 60|''Dragon'' #60]] used the 1{{st}}-edition nomenclature <code>1\"</code>, meaning {{SI|10|ft}} indoors and {{SI|10|yd}} outdoors. This was simplified to the shorter range in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. and visible to the caster (that is, it could not be inside a pouch or beneath clothing, for example). The insect was annoyed by the summoning and immediately attacked if it appeared on a living creature.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster focused their vision on the spot where the bug was to appear, spoke the type of the insect desired, and made a sliding motion with a forefinger that ended with pointing at the target."
