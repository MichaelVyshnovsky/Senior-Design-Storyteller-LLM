        "mainbody": "Shandarils tracer was a unique arcane divination spell that allowed the caster to track a target object. This spell was developed and used exclusively by the wizard Shandaril.\nWhen the invisible rune of this spell was placed upon an object such as a book or chest, the caster could determine the exact location of the object at any time purely by concentration on it. The spell also provided enough information about the objects location for the caster to teleport safely to the location. General information about whoever currently possessed the object was revealed to the caster as well.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material components the target object to cast.\nShandaril used this spell to secretly mark her workbook so she could release it into unknowing hands, track the individual down, and eventually slay them to steal their magic."
