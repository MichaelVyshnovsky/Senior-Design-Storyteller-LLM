        "mainbody": "'''''Shandaril's tracer''''' was a unique [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[divination]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to track a target object. This spell was developed and used exclusively by the [[wizard]] [[Shandaril]].",
        "Effects": "When the invisible rune of this spell was placed upon an object such as a book or chest, the caster could determine the exact location of the object at any time purely by concentration on it. The spell also provided enough information about the object's location for the caster to ''[[teleport]]'' safely to the location. General information about whoever currently possessed the object was revealed to the caster as well.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]]s the target object to cast.",
        "History": "Shandaril used this spell to secretly mark her ''[[Shandaril's Workbook|workbook]] so she could release it into unknowing hands, track the individual down, and eventually slay them to steal their magic."
