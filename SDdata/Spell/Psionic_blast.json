        "mainbody": "'''''Psionic blast''''' was a [[psionic]] power of the [[telepathy]] [[discipline]] that stunned a foe's mind. It was sometimes called '''''mind blast''''', and quite dreaded by non-psionic beings, but it was actually unrelated to an [[illithid]]'s ''[[mind blast]]''.",
        "Effects": "''Psionic blast'' emitted a wave of \"brain force\", originally forming a cone 60 feet (18 meters) long, 5 feet (1.5 meters) at its origin and 2 feet (6 meters) at its limit, later reduced to 30 feet (9 meters). It jolted the minds of those affected, like delivering \"shocking news\", and later outright blasted their minds as the name said, stunning them for several seconds. After the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], if an experienced manifester spent more psionic energy, they could augment the duration. After the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], it emitted a flood of mental energy, in all directions to 25 feet (7.6 meters) dazing and even stunning creatures in the area, but it could not be augmented.\n\n''Psionic blast'' was originally one of the five attacks of psionic combat and was a way of making forced ''[[contact]]''. and finally it was strongest against ''[[empty mind]]'' and weakest against ''mental barrier'' again.",
        "Prerequisite Powers": "Early versions required knowledge of ''[[mindlink]]'' to learn.",
        "Display": "Manifesting the power produced the standard auditory [[display]]. The force of the mental attack caused the very air to ripple.",
        "Significance": "\"Psionic Blaster\" was the title of the first rank of the clergy of [[Deep Duerra]], the [[duergar]] goddess of psionics.<ref>\n\nThe ability to manifest a ''psionic blast'' was a requirement for becoming a [[cognition thief]] in the [[Hall of Mental Splendor]].",
        "Users": "''Psionic blast'' could be learned by [[psionicist]]s and [[psion]]s, as well as by [[wilder]]s.\n\nIt could be known by [[su-monster]]s and [[ikiryo]].\n\nIn psionics terms, it could also be known by [[ki-rin]], [[githyanki]], and [[githzerai]], and by [[astral deva]]s, [[planetar]]s, and [[solar]]s among [[aasimon]]; by [[pit fiend]]s among [[baatezu]]; by [[babau]]s, [[balor]]s, [[marilith]]s, and [[nalfeshnee]]s among [[tanar'ri]]; and only by [[arcanaloth]]s among [[yugoloth]]s.",
        "Notable Users": "* [[Araumycos]], the enormous fungal growth in the [[Underdark]], was capable of all psionic attacks, but favored ''mind blast'' and ''[[mind thrust]]''\n* [[Vhondryl]], a [[psion]] in [[Skullport]] and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor{{Cite dragon/172/Seeing the Sights in Skullport|12, 14, 88}}\n* [[Ryvvik Dlardrageth]], [[daemonfey]] [[psionicist]] and third-in-command of [[House Dlardrageth]]<ref>\n* [[Raulothim]], the [[emerald dragon]] of [[Ruathym]].{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Raulothim, \"The Silent Shadow\"}}\n* [[Bleucorundum]], the Sapphire Sentinel, a [[sapphire dragon]].{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|69}}\n* [[Lugribossk]], [[proxy]] for the [[illithid]] god [[Ilsensine]].\n* [[Lertis the Seer]], priest of Bane<ref>\n* [[Teliene Coloara]], an [[illithid slayer]]<ref>{{Cite web/Realms Personalities/Teliene Coloara}}\n* [[Selinah Varhast]], a psychic assassin<ref>{{Cite web/Realms Personalities/Selinah Varhast}}"
