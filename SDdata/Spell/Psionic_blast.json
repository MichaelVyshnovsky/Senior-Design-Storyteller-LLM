        "mainbody": "Psionic blast was a psionic power of the telepathy discipline that stunned a foes mind. It was sometimes called mind blast, and quite dreaded by non-psionic beings, but it was actually unrelated to an illithids mind blast.\nPsionic blast emitted a wave of \"brain force\", originally forming a cone 60 feet (18 meters) long, 5 feet (1.5 meters) at its origin and 2 feet (6 meters) at its limit, later reduced to 30 feet (9 meters). It jolted the minds of those affected, like delivering \"shocking news\", and later outright blasted their minds as the name said, stunning them for several seconds. After the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, if an experienced manifester spent more psionic energy, they could augment the duration. After the Spellplague of 1385 DR, it emitted a flood of mental energy, in all directions to 25 feet (7.6 meters) dazing and even stunning creatures in the area, but it could not be augmented.\nPsionic blast was originally one of the five attacks of psionic combat and was a way of making forced contact. and finally it was strongest against empty mind and weakest against mental barrier again.\nEarly versions required knowledge of mindlink to learn. \nManifesting the power produced the standard auditory display. The force of the mental attack caused the very air to ripple.\n\"Psionic Blaster\" was the title of the first rank of the clergy of Deep Duerra, the duergar goddess of psionics.\nThe ability to manifest a psionic blast was a requirement for becoming a cognition thief in the Hall of Mental Splendor.\nPsionic blast could be learned by psionicists and psions, as well as by wilders.\nIt could be known by su-monsters and ikiryo.\nIn psionics terms, it could also be known by ki-rin, githyanki, and githzerai, and by astral devas, planetars, and solars among aasimon by pit fiends among baatezu by babaus, balors, mariliths, and nalfeshnees among tanarri and only by arcanaloths among yugoloths.\n* Araumycos, the enormous fungal growth in the Underdark, was capable of all psionic attacks, but favored mind blast and mind thrust\n* Vhondryl, a psion in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor\n* Ryvvik Dlardrageth, daemonfey psionicist and third-in-command of House Dlardrageth\n* Raulothim, the emerald dragon of Ruathym.\n* Bleucorundum, the Sapphire Sentinel, a sapphire dragon.\n* Lugribossk, proxy for the illithid god Ilsensine.\n* Lertis the Seer, priest of Bane\n* Teliene Coloara, an illithid slayer\n* Selinah Varhast, a psychic assassin"
