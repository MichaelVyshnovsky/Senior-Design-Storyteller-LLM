        "mainbody": "Polymorph other was a powerful and common spell that let one change another individual into another form.\nWhen cast, the targeted creature was completely transformed. Not only was their physical appearance altered, but their abilities, intelligence, personality and skills as well. The targeted creature could only be transformed into another creature, the caster was unable to use this spell to transform an individual into an object or a plant nor a non-corporeal form. The transformation was a shock on the targets system, there was a chance the targeted creature was killed by the spell. If killed while the spell was in effect, the targeted creature reverted to their natural form. Any equipment in the physical possession of a targeted creature was melded into their new form.\nOnce transformed, the targeted creature acquired not only the physical form but also the abilities of their new body. There were some limits. If transformed into a form whose natural abilities included innate magical abilities, the polymorphed creature did not inherit these abilities. If a doppelganger, druid, lycanthrope or other natural shapeshifters were targeted with this spell, the effect of the spell was limited and their form was transformed for only a very short period of time.\nIf the polymorphed individual lost their original mentality and personality and fully adapted the mentality of their new form, they effectively became their new form, even acquiring any innate magical abilities. The only way to reverse this was if a wish spell was cast upon them. If the polymorphed individual only lost their individuality to their new form, a dispel magic spell would revert their physical form to their original form but they still retained the individuality of their polymorphed form. For example, if a human who was polymorphed into a copper dragon came to believe fully they were indeed a copper dragon, after returning to their human form, they now believed they were a copper dragon who has been polymorphed into a human.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, the cocoon of a caterpillar. The spell cast by wu jen used the wings of a moth wrapped in a piece of silk.\nThis spell was invented in  by Netherese arcanist Quantoul. It was the last spell he developed and was originally called Quantouls othermorph., Bowgentles Book and the Tome of the Unicorn."
