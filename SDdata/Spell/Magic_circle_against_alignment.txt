Magic circle against alignment was a spell which protected a caster from either evil or good alignment.
During casting, the caster selected which alignment to defend against. When cast, this spell created an area with a radius of  around a targeted creature. Within this area, immunity was granted against mind-affecting effects or spells used by the selected alignment. The spell also provided minimal protection against physical attacks from creatures of the selected alignment.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
