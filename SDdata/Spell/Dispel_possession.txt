'''''Dispel possession''''' was a [[spell]] that  granted temporary liberation to a targeted creature from the influence of certain magical effects.
 
==Effects==
When cast, this spell temporarily removed the influence of influence of charm spells, magic-based mental dominations and controls, psionic attacks or dominations, and ESP or similar eavesdropping magics. By utilizing this spell, a charm enchantment was permanently shattered, freeing the recipient from its influence. However, other forms of mental attacks and controls resumed their effect once the duration of the spell expires.

If ''dispel possession'' was directed at a victim who has fallen prey to a prior ''[[magic jar]]'' spell, the life force that had taken control of the victim's body was forcibly expelled and returned to its original container.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], a single teardrop from an [[elf]], [[half-elf]] or [[human]].
