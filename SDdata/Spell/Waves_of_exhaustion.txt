Waves of exhaustion was a necromancy spell that made the targets exhausted.
On casting waves of exhaustion, the caster generated waves of negative energy within a 60 ft (18 m) cone. This negative energy instilled exhaustion in everyone who was not so to begin with.
Waves of exhaustion required only somatic and verbal components.
