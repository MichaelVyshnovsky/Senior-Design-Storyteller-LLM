'''''Fistandantilus's firequench''''', also shortened to just '''''firequench''''', was an [[abjuration]] and [[alteration]] spell that extinguished fires and prevented flammable materials from igniting.

==Effects==
This spell protected a spherical volume with a radius of 40 ft (12 m) for a duration of four minutes. The center of the effect could be set at a distance of 210 ft (64 m). More experienced casters could increase this range. During this time, all normal fires were extinguished and magical fires had one chance to resist the spell or be snuffed out. New fires could not be started inside the designated sphere for the duration of the spell. All creatures got one chance to resist the spell. Creatures with a fire-creating power had to overcome the magic of this spell each time they attempted to use their powers. Magically created fires (which included [[fire elemental]]s and ''[[fireball]]s'') were prevented or extinguished by random chance, with the odds decreasing as the level of the fire-causing effect increased. Note that fires started by ''fireball'' and similar agents were considered normal fires after the magical effect dissipated.

This spell was often cast in anticipation of a fire-based attack. The area of effect was fixed at casting time and did not move with the caster or anything else that was designated as the center of the effect.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell could use a variety of [[material component]]s. Items known to work were a chip of ice, a cupped handful of water, a pinch of [[sand]], or even some of the caster's saliva.

==History==
According to [[Dalamar]], an [[archmage]] from the world of [[Krynn]], this spell was invented by an evil wizard known as [[Fistandantilus]]. Dalamar gave copies of this spell to [[Elminster]] and [[Mordenkainen]], an archmage from [[Oerth]], at one of their meetings at the house of [[Ed of the Greenwood]].
