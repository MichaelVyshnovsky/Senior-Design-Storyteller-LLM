Snake summoning was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
A shugenja used this spell to summon all serpents, serpent-like creatures and snakes within an area of 120 feet (36 meters). The snakes did not harm the shugenja or their companions. If the snakes were attacked, the spell was broken and they became aggressive. When the spell expired, the summoned creatures returned to their normal activities.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small flute made of silver. The shugenja played this flute for the duration of the spell.
