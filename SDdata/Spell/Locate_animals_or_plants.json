        "mainbody": "Locate animals or plants, also known as detect animals or plants, was a divination spell that allowed the caster to discover the direction, distance, and approximate number of one type of animal or plant desired.\nThe caster picked a direction and one type of animal or plant, and then concentrated for a short time to discover if the desired plant or animal was within the range of the spell. For the older versions of this spell, the area of scrutiny was a 20 ft (6.1 m) wide corridor that extended out 100 yd (91 m) and more depending on caster level. The newer version divined in a cone-shaped area that extended out 400 ft (123 m) and more. If the caster concentrated long enough, details about the condition of the specimens found could be gleaned. The caster could then pick a new direction to examine, provided the spell did not expire.\nThis spell could penetrate barriers, by 1 ft (30 cm) of stone, 1 in (2.5cm) of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 ft (1 m) of wood or dirt blocked it.\nThe oldest version of this spell was actually two spells. Druids first learned to locate animals, and then advanced to locating plants.\nVerbal and somatic components, as well as the priests holy symbol or divine focus were required to cast this spell. The newest version of this spell did not require a divine focus to cast. The post-Second Sundering version required a material component in the form of a bit of fur from a bloodhound."
