Exorcism was a divine abjuration spell from the necromantic sphere that cast a spirit from an object or area.
The casting time for this spell depended on the inherent strength of the possessing spirit, with stronger spirits taking longer. The fortitude of the casting priest was tested during the casting and was directly related to the spells success.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a book of prayers, a small silver bell, and a small candle that was lit during the casting. The candle was extinguished at the end of the spell.
Exorcism was used on both an ikiryo and kuei in Kara-Tur.
