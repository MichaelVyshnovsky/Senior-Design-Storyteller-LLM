'''''Exorcism''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] from the [[necromantic sphere]] that cast a [[spirit]] from an object or area.

==Effects==
The casting time for this spell depended on the inherent strength of the possessing spirit, with stronger spirits taking longer. The fortitude of the casting [[priest]] was tested during the casting and was directly related to the spell's success.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a book of prayers, a small [[silver]] bell, and a small candle that was lit during the casting. The candle was extinguished at the end of the spell.

==History==
''Exorcism'' was used on both an [[ikiryo]] and [[kuei]] in [[Kara-Tur]].
