        "mainbody": "Smokepuff was a personal cantrip that initiate wizards could learn. It created a small amount of smoke in a small selection of colors.\nThis spell created a puff of smoke about  in diameter at a distance of up to  from the caster. Once created, it immediately became susceptible to the prevailing conditions. In a calm room, the smoke rose toward the ceiling as typical, but a breeze would scatter and dissipate it. The caster could choose the color of the smoke as either white, black, gray, brown, green, or yellow.\nThis cantrip require verbal and somatic components. The caster extended a hand horizontally and spoke the desired color, then blew out a breath of air and raised the hand to the vertical.\nThe untitled book known as Briels Book of Shadows described this cantrip, including how to shape the smoke into rings.The four cantrips described in Dragon #97 were replaced with the cantrip spell when the 2-edition Pages from the Mages was published. The Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four describes all the 1-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with cantrip."
