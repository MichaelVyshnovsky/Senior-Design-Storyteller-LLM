Dehydration was a powerful wizard spell that combined the schools of alteration and necromancy to devastating effect. It was used commonly by the members of the  Brotherhood of the True Flame in Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
If the caster of this spell was able to successfully touch the target, and if the target was not able to resist the spells effects, the magic instantly dehydrated the target, causing a substantial permanent loss of their bodily fortitude and health. The spell was capable of killing weaker individuals.
Victims suffering from this magical-induced dehydration were able to counteract the effects by consuming water so long as they remained inactive and did not lose additional fluids to perspiration. An inactive victim who consumed one quarter gallon (1 liter) of water within one day would naturally replenish the health they lost from the spell. Active or encumbered victims needed to consume a half gallon or more to achieve the same results. Re-hydrating their body did not restore health lost from the physical damage the spell caused. Instead, it merely returned their core fortitude to its original state.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast.
