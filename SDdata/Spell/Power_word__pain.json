        "Effects": "The caster targeted a creature within a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} and spoke a single word of power. If unable to resist the effect, the target creature was stricken with intense, near-paralyzing pain. While under this effect, which lasted until the target could successfully resist the effect, the afflicted creature could only move extremely slowly, and could only perform activities, including casting spells, with an extreme effort. Extraordinarily strong opponents at the peak of their vitality were immune to the effect, as well as creatures that were immune to being [[charm]]ed.",
        "Components": "The spell only required a [[verbal component]]."
