        "mainbody": "File:Gnome - Raven Mimura.jpg|thumb|left|''A male [[forest gnome]].'']]\nGnomes were very small compared to most other races, with an average height of {{SIrange|3'0\"|4'0\"|ft-in}} and a weight of {{SIrange|40|45|lbs|k}}.

Similarly, gnomish hair varied wildly in color from blond and brown to more exotic colors like white, orange, or even green. Gnomish eyes were often—particularly in individuals who were native to the [[Feywild]]—glittering black or blue, although more natural eye colors were also known to the race.\n\nIn terms of clothing, gnomes often preferred those with earthen tones or made of leather.

        "Personality": {
            "Adventuring": "Gnomes who left home to seek an [[adventurer]]'s life were rare, given the race's famed shyness and lack of ambition. Those that did were motivated by a number of factors, but the impulsive race was often driven by curiosity more than anything else. Many gnomes felt no more rationale for adventuring than simply to explore the world that surrounded them. A few, the more orderly ones that is, sought out adventure for more innately noble purposes, such as to help others, but these gnomes were rare. Other gnomes were driven to become adventurers by little more than simple avarice, as adventuring was often seen as a quick, if unsafe, avenue for wealth. Adventuring was not necessarily a welcomed lifestyle among gnomes, despite the curiosity that filled the whole race, and sometimes was, in fact, seen as a betrayal of sorts to a gnome's clan."
        },
        "Abilities": {
            "Magic": "Gnomes were talented [[illusionist]]s, with a natural grasp of the arcane. Regardless of their other talents, all gnomes were capable of casting a cantrip or two and had the capacity to disappear from sight if they wished. Gnomes were well-suited to all forms of arcane training, particularly that of a [[bard]], [[sorcerer]], [[warlock]], or [[wizard]]."
        },
        "Combat": "Gnomes were known to wear a wide range of armor and [[shield]] types into combat. Including [[leather armor|leather]], [[studded leather]], [[ring mail]], and [[chainmail]]. In terms of weapons they most commonly fought with [[club]]s, [[short bow]]s, [[short sword]]s, [[sling]]s, and [[spear]]s.",
        "Society": {
            "Lairs": "[[File:Gnomebadger.png|thumb|273x273px|''A gnome with a badger companion.'']]\nIn the [[Feywild]], as well as some places on [[Toril]], gnomes typically lived in earthen burrows and dug-out homes akin to those used by [[badger]]s, [[fox]]es, or [[rabbit]]s. As such they were fond of these small animals, feeling a sense of natural kinship with them. And much like these animals, gnomes had an aversion to danger that made them naturally inclined to hide away if able. Thus many gnomish homes were carefully hidden by magic or other methods.\n\nGnomes most often liked to keep badgers, [[giant badger]]s, and [[wolverine]]s as guard animals in their lairs.",
            "Homelands": "Gnomes primarily lived in wooded, hilly landscapes, most often underground. They typically built earthen homes with cellars and escape tunnels. Above-ground structures were often round and made of stone and thatch. Generally speaking, though, gnomes enjoyed the fresh air a good deal more than other subterranean races such as dwarves or drow and rarely burrowed very deep, spending a great deal of time on the surface. Gnomish homes or communities were generally well-hidden, making it difficult for unwelcome visitors to find them. Within, gnomish houses were warm and comfortable, akin to the burrows of small mammals.\n\nGnomes were found widely throughout the world, though rarely in large numbers. Small communities were most commonly found in the [[Western Heartlands]], [[Elturgard]], and along the coastline of the [[Shining Sea]]. Other gnomes, notably the svirfneblin or deep gnomes, were found in the Underdark and were even more secretive than other gnomes, maintaining their distance from other races except for dwarves, with whom they were careful to maintain polite relationships for the purpose of protection.\n\nThe majority of gnomes were found in [[Lantan]], the only land in which gnomes lived in great numbers and the closest they had to a homeland.\n\nThe Feydark was home to a large number of gnomes. Their physical appearance differed from their surface-dwelling cousins, having larger eyes and skin so pale it appeared almost translucent. Feydark gnome culture was also quite different from that of surface-dwelling gnomes. They were known for their violent tendencies and gallows humor, while madness and savagery were considered positive personality traits. Feydark gnomes were also extremely xenophobic.",
            "Religion": "The primary gnome [[deity]] of the [[Lords of the Golden Hills|gnomish pantheon]] was [[Garl Glittergold]]. Other deities of the pantheon were [[Baervan Wildwanderer]], [[Gaerdal Ironhand]], and [[Urdlen]]. These gods were all themselves, at least after the [[Spellplague]], members of the [[Seldarine]], the fey pantheon headed by [[Corellon|Corellon Larethian]].\n\nGnome funeral rites often employed cremation. It destroyed the body, (preventing desecration), and released the spirit to find its own way.<ref>",
            "Languages": "Most gnomes spoke [[Common]] as well as their own language, [[Gnomish]]. Some were known to be capable of speaking [[Dwarvish]], [[Halfling language|Halfling]], [[Goblin language|Goblin]], and [[Yipyak]]. Others were even said to be capable of speaking with burrowing mammals.",
            "Relations": "[[File:Gnome 2e.jpg|thumb|''An older rotund gnome, armed with his [[hammer]].'']]\nGnomes, in general, were a reclusive people who'd rather stay out of others' affairs. Though some races interpreted this as cowardice, it's more the case that gnomes simply had nothing at stake in the conflicts between most other races and after centuries of being ignored or stomped on, were not particularly eager to fight someone else's fight. In fact, generally speaking, gnomes were a very courageous and good-hearted race, who frequently used their neutrality as a way to negotiate disputes. Of all the races in [[Faerûn]], it's fair to say that gnomes had the fewest enemies, although they had very few friends as well.\n\nGnomes rarely intentionally invoked ire in any group, but at times circumstances made conflict with other races unavoidable. In the [[Feywild]], gnomes were particularly wary of the fomorians that sometimes enslaved them, regarding them with fear and caution. In the [[Prime Material Plane]], gnomes were most often at odds with [[goblin]]s and [[kobold]]s, who shared their underground homes and often war with them for territory or wealth. In these cases, gnomes were rarely the aggressors, owing to their tendency to avoid trouble rather than cause it.\n\nGnomes were on fairly good terms with other fey, being particularly fond of eladrin, though they also shared good relations with elves. Gnomes also had sympathy for the fey commonly enslaved by fomorians, feeling empathy for creatures that shared the fate many of their forbears had suffered. Gnomes also got along well enough with halflings.\n\nAmong those gnomes who lived in the caverns of the Prime, dwarves were often counted as friends, due in part to the two races' physical and cultural similarities. Additionally, dwarves and gnomes both counted goblins and [[giant]]s as enemies and could often be found working together against them. Gnomes were generally suspicious of other races, however.",
            "Culture": "Gnomes produced distinctly-colored glass items. Gnome glass was green like impure [[jade]] and translucent. This hue was a result of the gnome crafters melting and reshaping glass. Gnomish green glass cups were a commodity found throughout the Realms."
        },
        "Biology": {
            "Sub-Races": "There were several subraces of gnomes, as listed below:\n;[[Forest gnome]]s\n: Smaller than other gnomes, these gnomes were a shy, secretive folk, living deep in wooded areas.\n;[[Rock gnomes]]\n: Rock gnomes primarily occupied burrows beneath rolling, wooded hills throughout [[Faerûn]].\n;[[Deep gnomes]]\n: The deep gnomes, or svirfneblin, dwelt in cities deep underground in the [[Underdark]]. They were far stealthier, much more combative, and avaricious than surface-dwelling gnomes. The former two qualities being because they had to constantly defend themselves against [[drow]] and other deadly enemies. Surface-dwelling gnomes had great respect, even reverence, for their [[Underdark]] brethren."
        },
        "History": "Throughout time gnomes maintained a rich oral tradition, but largely lacked a recorded history and they were rarely mentioned in the historical texts of other races. Because of this, it was unknown when exactly gnomes first emerged on Toril and migrated across Faerûn.\n\nGnomish myths held that the gods of the gnome pantheon originated as gems deep within the bowels of the earth that were then exposed to open air.\n\nBeyond the ''Treatise Historical of the Dragon Tyrants'',{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 6}} For the Netherese, the first gnomes to be enslaved were rock gnomes from nearby hills in [[-3649 DR]].<ref> That same year the Netherese, allegedly inspired by the evil Gnomish god Urdlen, began conducting experiments with magic to warp their gnome slaves into what became known as [[spriggan]]s, though by some accounts this offshoot race did not appear in the Realms until much later.\n\nThe \"Time of Bondage\" as this period became known, such as [[Earlann]] and [[Illefarn]], \n\nThe elven nations would for a time house these refugees in the underground levels of the many frontier garrisons they had built to protect their forests, a fact of history that would later be largely forgotten by all but the gnomes. Fearing that they may incur the wrath of Netheril's [[archwizard]]s, the Earlanni eventually would shepherd their refugees further south of [[High Forest]] with the aid of Cormanthyr.<ref>\n\nMany [[elven high mage]]s would take a liking to the gnomish people and go on to teach them the art of magic.<ref> These early gnomish spellcasters found their people had an affinity for the illusion school of magic and its subschool [[phantasm]] - due to the ongoing need to hide from their Netherese captors, a tradition of specializing in this aspect of magic would begin to develop among the gnomes.\n\nAround [[-3150 DR]], the [[Mythallar Era]] of Netheril, the [[Trail of Mists]] was created through the joint efforts of gnome illusionists and Earlanni High Mages. A network of [[Border Ethereal]] crossings that linked together several elven fortifications, the Trail of Mists would make it easier for escaped gnomes to flee from Netheril. This system allowed slaves to easily move across [[the North]], as far south as what later became known as the [[River Chionthar]] and as far east as the mountain range later known as the [[Stormhorns]]. Most would choose to flee south, to the lands far beyond Netheril's sphere of influence. Over time these successful escapes from slavery would inspire further revolts.\n\nThe gnomish tradition of illusion magic was further improved upon around [[-3095 DR]] by the elf [[Rilmohx Sha’Quessir]], who gained a deeper understanding of the school after glimpsing a stolen set of ''[[Nether Scrolls]]'' within [[Windsong Tower]] and spread what he learned to the gnomes.\n\nIt would not be until the latter half of the Silver Age of Netheril, an age which commenced in [[-2758 DR]], that the gnomes would finally gain their freedom. Through a combination of stubborn refusal to work, their newfound skills in illusion magic, and the diplomatic efforts of Earlanni ambassadors. Resistant at first to give in, Netheril's archwizards tried to use mind-controlling magics to keep the gnomes in line, but this practice only proved to make them produce inventions that were of an inferior quality. Netheril would finally relent in [[-2387 DR]], emancipating their gnome populace. The gnomes that remained in Netheril would proceed to migrate south and east of what later became [[Anauroch]], seeking to get far away from the Netherese.\n\nSome gnomes would immigrate to the [[Western Heartlands]], settling in the [[Backlands]] and [[Sunset Vale]]. There in the [[Forgotten Forest]] of the Backlands and the [[Trielta Hills]] of Sunset Vale, forest and rock gnome communities respectively would be established with strong oral traditions, maintaining stories that told of their people's flight from Netheril and the challenges they endured along the way. It was also in these communities that the centuries of magical warping by the Netherese, begun back in -3649 DR,\n\nBy the early [[Age of Humanity]], a number of elves in [[Myth Drannor]] would joke that their gnome neighbors must have been descended from [[Drannor]], on account of viewing the traditional personalities and values they exhibited as a sort of blending of elven and dwarven attitudes. Some humans would misinterpret this as a fact, spawning a long lasting misconception that gnomes were a hybrid race. \n\nAs the Age of Humanity went on, gnomes stood apart from the other races who over the centuries continued to establish empires and waged terrible wars against their fellow man. and the kingdom of [[Phalorm]].<ref> Over time some began referring to gnomes as the \"Forgotten Folk\", musing that they faded into the background of history whilst people of other races adventured, forged mighty legends, and were willing to challenge those in power.\n\nSome ancient gnome artifacts predating Netheril would survive well into the 14{{th}} century DR. However, despite this, some non-gnome sages would try to propose the erroneous theory that gnomes might have been created by [[Netherese arcanist]]s in an effort to make the perfect servile race.\n\n[[File:Gnome.JPG|thumb|right|''A gnome of Lantan.'']]\nAs the human population in Faerûn grew and gnomes became further marginalized, younger generations began questioning the wisdom of their forebears in taking a deliberately passive role in world events. This attitude was seemingly encouraged by the appearance of [[Gond]], the god of invention, among the gnomes of Lantan during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]]. As a result, a gradual trend emerged of more and more gnomes leaving their reclusive homes to travel the world. Many rock and deep gnomes went on to take up the life of a [[lorefinder]], seeking to uncover lost Netherese magic their fore-bearers had taken with them in their ancient emigrations from Netheril, in hopes to use such magic to bolster the position of the gnomish race. But along the way, such lorefinders uncovered many horrors thought lost long ago.<ref> But as always, gnomes had an aversion to becoming a part of anything \"too big.\" Thus many others scattered into smaller, like-minded communities instead of attempting to direct larger ones."
