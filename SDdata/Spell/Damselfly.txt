A damselfly was a spelljammer similar in design to a dragonfly, but including several modifications that resulted in a sturdier vessel that could operate with a much smaller crew.
The damselflys hull was made of enameled metal. All its decks were covered, including a weapon compartment behind the wings that had a sliding hatch, which could be opened to reveal a single heavy weapon (typically a ballista, a catapult or a jettison).
The ships efficient wing design allowed it to be operated by an extremely small crew only two people were required to crew a damselfly. The ship could hold a compliment of up to ten creatures without compromising its air supply. This trait made damselflies the favorite choice of hermits and smugglers, as well as solitary monsters such as rakshasas and liches.
Damselflies could be modified to suit a variety of purposes. Some had the cargo compartment converted to carry a second weapon, while others had the spelljamming helm replaced by a non-magical engine in order to operate like a shuttle and carry out landings and short-range reconnaissance missions. Other changes sometimes consisted of heavier hull armoring and the use of different materials.
In the midâ€’14 century DR, damselflies were being tested by mind flayer crews as a possible addition to their spelljamming fleets. The ships possessed qualities that illithids valued, such as covered decks and a safe, sturdy structure.
Damselflies were used as support vessels in the Imperial Radole Navy, charged with protecting the planet and challenging any approaching vessels.
