        "mainbody": "'''''Seal of Cyrrollalee''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Cyrrollalee]].",
        "Effects": "This spell was used on two or more individuals who wished to enter into a contractual agreement or make a pledge of some sort. The spell assured each party that the agreed-upon terms or pledges were overseen by Cyrrollalee herself. The spell required each participating party to swear an oath to Cyrrollalee. The spell could not be cast if any of the individuals were not a willing participant, was under the influence of a ''[[charm]]''-based spell, or was not in the proper state of mind.\n\nIf any of the participants broke their pledge or failed to meet their contractual obligations, they suffered the same effects as a ''[[curse]]'' spell. If a participant willingly broke their pledge or contractual obligations, then they invoked the wrath of Cyrrollalee herself. Their lives suffered until they made amends. Anyone breaking the contract or pledge could be released from their punishment if a cleric of Cyrrollalee cast an ''[[atonement]]'' spell upon them.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]] the [[holy symbol]] of Cyrrollalee."
