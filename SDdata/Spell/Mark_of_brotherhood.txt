Mark of brotherhood was a spell used by dwarven clerics.
When cast, a glyph appeared on each hand of the caster. One glyph was the symbol of the casters clan, and the other the casters holy symbol. The glyphs became invisible and were only visible to those dwarves who had the same glyphs. The glyphs were permanent, but they vanished if the caster committed a serious offense against their clan and/or clergy. If such a thing came to pass, the glyphs flared with a brilliant light and seared the casters hands, causing them great pain and leaving behind scars. The scars were permanent no amount of healing could remove them. The only way to remove the scars was if the caster made amends for their offenses.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a coin made from steel that had the casters clan symbol on one side and their holy symbol on the other. The coin was consumed by the spell.
