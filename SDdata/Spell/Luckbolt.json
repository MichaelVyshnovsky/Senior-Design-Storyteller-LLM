        "mainbody": "Luckbolt was a divine conjuration and evocation spell used by priests devoted to Tymora, enabling them to experience profound luck for several minutes.\nThis spell could be used on the caster or a recipient provided they were in view, by any means, of the caster. This included viewing someone through magical means. The effects of this spell lasted for several minutes, becoming slightly weaker with each passing minute. The target of this spell could strike for maximum damage during the first minute of the spell as well as perform any their skills to the best of their ability. Luckbolt also made it easier for the recipient to resist the harmful effects of spells, poison, etc.\nTymora did not look favorably upon those who cast luckbolt on themselves when their companions were in dire need of the spells magic.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
