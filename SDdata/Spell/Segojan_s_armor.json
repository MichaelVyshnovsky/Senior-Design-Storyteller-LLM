        "mainbody": "Segojans armor was a spell used by clerics of Segojan Earthcaller.\nWhen cast, this spell provided protection against mundane weapons in the same fashion as scale mail but weighed the same as regular clothing. In addition, it negated many combat spells such as magic missile. The spell was vulnerable to dispel magic.\nBefore casting, the caster had to gather some grass and roots and place them in a pile. They then sprinkled powdered iron over the pile during casting. The grass and roots then magically weaved themselves into a full suit of armor. Only the caster was able to wear the suit of armor.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Segojan Earthcaller and  of iron powder."
