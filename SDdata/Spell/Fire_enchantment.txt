Fire enchantment was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, the spell allowed a wu jen to cast a suggestion spell on a fire. Any creature who looked at the fire would be affected.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components in the form of a lit candle and a mirror.
