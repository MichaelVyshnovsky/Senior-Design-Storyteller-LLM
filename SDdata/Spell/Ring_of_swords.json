        "mainbody": "'''''Ring of swords''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the school of [[alteration]].",
        "Description": "This spell created a defensive shield of metal-bladed weapons that could be either [[magic item|magic weapons]] or regular ones. The weapons comprising the ''ring of swords'' were made from whatever weapons the caster could touch when casting the spell.\n\nThe weapons formed a ring the maximum size of which was determined by the caster's skill but could easily have a diameter of nearly {{SI|200|ft|long=yes}}. The weapons orbited the ring in either a clockwise or counterclockwise motion as determined by the caster. In addition to the exterior ring, a sphere of blades formed about the caster as well.\n\nThe area protected by the ring could be safely traversed by the caster and anyone who spoke the correct password, which was chosen by the caster, when they came within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the swords. The blades could even be touched or handled by these even individuals. When released, the swords flew back to join the ''ring of swords''. Any creature within the inner protective sphere area when the spell was cast was able to safely move through the ''ring of swords'' regardless of the caster's wishes.\n\nAny being crossing the barriers of the ''ring of swords'' without the safe password triggered the weapons to attack. The weapons only attacked those targets who crossed the barrier. The weapons would also attack any being who had not crossed the barrier if they attempted to strike at or interfere with the weapons. Magical weapons always struck to the maximum output of their associated potential as long as they had sufficient charges. All of the weapons attempted to strike targets twice with each attempt and were able to pursue fleeing targets up to a distance of {{SI|70|ft|long=yes}} from the exterior border of the ring.\n\nThe weapons of the ''ring of swords'' could be rendered inanimate if dealt a sufficient amount of damage, at which point they would drop to the ground.\n\nA ''ring of swords'' would cease when all of the weapons were rendered inanimate, when the caster uttered the password in reverse, or when 29 years had passed since the caster's death. ''[[Dispel magic]]'' or similar spells caused some of the weapons to drop to the ground. The number of weapons affected was based on the caster's skill level. Magical barriers could be used to push through the ring, but the weapons instantly sought ways around the barriers to attack.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]]s the weapons touched by the caster, which were not consumed by the spell, and a [[sapphire]] worth at least 4,000 [[gp]] for each blade touched by the caster. The sapphires were powdered and sprinkled over each blade as well as the the center of the inner protective sphere."
