        "mainbody": "Stormrage was an alteration/evocation spell that granted an individual storm-related powers for a short duration of time.\nWhen this spell was cast, a cleric was able to imbue themself or another individual a number of powers for matter of seconds. The affected person was granted the ability of flight, immunity to magical and mundane lightning along with resilience to strong gusts of wind. Additionally, a person in a storm rage was able to discharge pairs of lightning bolts every few seconds.\nThe specifications of this spell were inscribed upon the Talassan relic, the Chanting Chain.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, stormrage required a number of material components, including a feather taken from a bird capable of flight, a single piece of flint and a small amount of ash taken from any living being that had been struck by lightning."
