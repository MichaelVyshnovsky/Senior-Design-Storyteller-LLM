'''''Unlock''''' was a personal [[cantrip]] that initiate [[wizard]]s could learn. It could open simple locks of the type that used normal keys.

==Effects==
This cantrip conjured an invisible force in the shape of the key that would lock or unlock the targeted mechanism. It only worked on standard locks with typical keys and had no effect on combination locks or more complex designs using levers or tumblers. Magical wards, such as ''[[wizard lock]]'', that did not affect the locking mechanism were unfazed by this cantrip, but complex wards that were designed to prevent the use of skeleton keys could be defeated by ''unlock''.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster made a motion with one hand, as if holding an invisible key and turning it in a lock. The somatic portion varied, but examples included "tick-tock-doublelock", "yah-el", or "yay-el"."Tick tock, double lock. Throw away the key." was a phrase said by children when promising to keep their mouth shut or not reveal a shared secret. It was accompanied by a gesture of turning an invisible key in a closed mouth. (See ''Gold as the Morning Sun'' by Sylvia Halliday, for example.) "Yale" was a well-known brand name of locks.

==History==
This cantrip was recorded in the magical tome known as ''[[Sabirine's Specular]]'' along with five others including ''[[catfeet]]'', ''[[clean]]'', ''[[freshen]]'', ''[[snatch]]'', and ''[[spark]]''.{{Cite dragon/100/Pages from the Mages V|12}}<ref group="note">The cantrips mentioned in [[Dragon magazine 100|''Dragon'' #100]] and ''[[Encyclopedia Magica Volume III]]'' were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''.
