        "mainbody": "'''''Starshine''''' was an [[evocation]] and [[illusion]] [[spell]] with a rare [[illusion]] component of the third circle of magic, that illuminated an area.",
        "Description": "Once cast, ''starshine'' made the area of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} appear to be illuminated by the bright glow of a moonlit night, complete with stars. The range of the spell was {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} and both range and area of effect grew with the spell-caster's magical powers. The spell made it easier to notice movement in the darkness within {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} from the edge of the spell's glow and unmoving creatures within {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} from the glow's edge. The ''starshine'' created shadows and was unnoticeable to the ''[[infravision]]''. Lastly, the spell did not create a night sky. Instead, it was a mere illusion that shed starlight, and the spell did not work underwater.\n\nThe spell could also be cast using a ''[[staff of wanderers]]'', a ''[[moon ring]]'',{{Cite organized play/LC/Stormbreaker|27}} ''[[Moonarc]]'' [[scimitar]],{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|30}} or the ''[[Starshine (short sword)|Starshine]]'' [[sword]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Alter Egos|11}} Copies of the spell were also recorded in the ''[[Crystrum of Tranquility]]'', the ''[[Leaves of Green]]''. and the ''[[book of infinite spells]]''.",
        "Components": "''Starshine'' required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material components are several [[amaryllis]] ([[Hypoxis]]) plant stalks and several [[holly]] berries.",
