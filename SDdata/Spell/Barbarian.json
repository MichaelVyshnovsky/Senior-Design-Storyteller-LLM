        "Abilities": {
            "Rage": "The most distinctive aspect of barbarians was their ability to \"rage,\" wherein they let loose powerful emotional bursts fueled by their primal power or inner fury. When they raged, barbarians gained a number of powerful benefits, including an increase in physical prowess, and greater insensitivity to many forms of physical damage. This rage usually lasted about a minute, but with experience and training, most barbarians could extend it indefinitely.\n\nBarbarians also were known to take on other, less common abilities. While raging, barbarians were typically unable to cast evocations, [[spell]]s, or other similar abilities. Some barbarians were more skilled with lesser evocations whilst raging. Barbarians could also use a fraction of their raging power to deal a devastating attack known as a ''rage strike''.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|49-50}}"
        },
        "Primal Paths": {
            "Path of the Ancestral Guardian": "{{Main|Ancestral guardian}}\n[[File:Vengeful Ancestor.png|thumb|right|300px|''A dragonborn barbarian summons the vengeful spirit of their ancestor into battle.'']]\nAncestral guardian barbarians were from among the many cultures that venerated their ancestors, Warriors of these tribes were enlightened to the fact that [[spirit]]s of their ancestors could be called upon from the [[spirit world]]. They forged unique bonds with their ancestors that manifested as they [[Barbarian#Rage|raged]] into combat: sprits of their forebears would right alongside them in battle. These warriors were considered among the most mighty defenders of their tribes.\n\nAs the spirits appeared in battle, a spiritual shield formed around the barbarian and their allies. This shield not only protected them from harm during combat but even retaliated against their foes, turning their own attacks against them.\n\nWhen out of the battlefield, ancestral spirits often offered intuition and guidance to venerated barbarians. This came in the form of [[Clairaudience/clairvoyance|supernatural perception]] beyond what they saw before them, and [[augury|insight]] as to the potential outcomes of their decisions.",
            "Path of the Berserker": "{{main|Berserker (primal path)}}\nWhere some barbarians drew upon the essence of nature and primal magic for their power, barbarians on the Path of the Berserker instead relied on their own fury and unbridled bloodlust to pull them through a fight. As a result, berserkers relied less extensively on primal magic and instead focused on improving their rage ability. When a berserker raged they could enter into an even deeper state of primal fury known as a frenzy. While frenzied, a berserker was capable of attacking more quickly, although such effort eventually tired them out. Raging berserkers were also utterly fearless and immune to the effects of charms.\n\nIn addition to utilizing their rage in a way far greater than other barbarians, berserkers were also much more frightening to behold. Sufficiently powerful berserkers could actually cause their enemies to run in terror from them through their presence alone. Experienced berserkers also maintained exceptionally good battle reflexes, allowing them to strike a retaliatory blow to anyone who injured them in a fight.",
            "Path of the Totem Warrior": "{{Main|Totem warrior}}\nBarbarians with a more spiritual side pursued the path of the totem warrior, a calling which enhanced the barbarians' capacity for primal magic and forging a strong connection between them and their spirit animal. The spirit animal chosen by Totem Warriors - which was often related to their particular tribal culture - granted them a number of supernatural abilities, such as the ability to carry extra weight, enhance the ability of their allies in battle, or even fly a limited distance in short bursts. Additionally, Totem Warriors also sometimes took on physical features similar to their spirit animal, such as excess hair or unusually colored eyes.\n\nIn addition to the abilities mentioned above, Totem Warriors also gained the ability to cast druid spells such as ''[[beast sense]]'' or ''[[speak with animals]]'' as [[ritual]]s. Their ability with these spells were somewhat limited compared with that of a druid, but nonetheless allowed the Totem Warrior to tap into the primal essence of nature in order to enhance their awareness or gather information.",
            "Path of the Zealot": "{{Main|Zealot}}\n[[File:Barbarians XGE.png|thumb|right|400px|''A path of the zealot barbarian (left), along with one of the storm herald and ancestral guardian (right).'']]\nNot all barbarians channeled their might from ancestral spirits or even the natural world, but rather drew upon the power of the gods themselves. They were living incarnations of warfare, that channeled the will of their god onto the battlefield. They learned to [[channel divinity|channel the divinity]] of their patron god and assail their foes with otherworldly power. [[Bane]], [[Gruumsh]], [[Tyr]],\n\nWhenever a path of zealot barbarian was [[Barbarian#Rage|enraged]], they harnessed the power of their god whenever they struck their foes. They fought with fanatical fervor and could easily shrug off any effects that attempted to hinder or slow their frenzy. Battle-hardened barbarians could inspire similar zeal in their fellow warriors and even fight through wounds that would kill others of lesser faith."
