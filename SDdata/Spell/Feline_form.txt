Feline form was a powerful divine alteration spell used by specialty priests devoted to Nobanion called Firemanes, enabling them to shapechange into any feline species.
This spell allowed the caster to shapechange into any feline species, including partial transformations. Once transformed the caster had access to the species natural abilities including both their strengths and weaknesses. The casters form could be changed at will with the process taking only a second. If slain while using this spell the caster would remain in whatever form they selected at the time of their death.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components locks of hair from three different feline species to cast.
