        "mainbody": "'''''Faerie flames''''' was a very rare [[spell]] used by [[elf|elven]] [[cleric]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell was a more powerful variant of ''[[faerie fire]]''. When cast, this spell, like ''faerie fire'', outlined a target in a fiery glow. However, this spell inflicted damage to the targeted creature or object. The flames could not be extinguished like regular fire, so dousing in water or smothering the target had no effect. The spell was vulnerable to ''[[dispel magic]]'' and magical means of extinguishing fire such as a ''[[wand of flame extinguishing]]''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s {{SI|1|oz|long=yes}} of [[sulfur]] and a piece of [[foxfire]]. The material components were consumed by the spell during casting."
