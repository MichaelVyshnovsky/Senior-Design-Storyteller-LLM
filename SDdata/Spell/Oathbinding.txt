Oathbinding was a spell used commonly in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by wizards.
This spell bound a subject to a predetermined vow or condition, and exacted a penalty for failing to uphold the vow. Though oathbinding was similar to the genie contract spell, but differed because only one party was the subject of the spell. It was commonly used by a more powerful patron on their subjects. This spell had a definite end and specific condition which would trigger the penalty for breaking the vow. The spell would only end when the vow was fulfilled. Dispel magic or remove curse spells had no effect upon this spell.
This spell only required verbal components to cast, but the caster did need to sacrifice at least 1,000 gold to seal the deal.
