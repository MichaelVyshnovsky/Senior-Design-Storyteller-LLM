Death dragon was a divine necromancy spell that conjured a semi-corporeal dragon for a short duration of time.
When this spell was cast, the death dragon was created in front of the caster. It appeared as a large mass of bones, flesh, hair, fur, and other bodily remains formed in the shape of a dragon. It was not complete or solid in nature and could not be struck by other beings.
The dragon was capable of flight and could attack the foes of the spells caster.
A death dragon was vulnerable to the spell dispel magic.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required one or more bones either four whole bones, half of which had be to avian or reptilian, or a single draconic bone.
The specifications of this spell were outlined in the Kelemvorite relic, the Testament of Vraer.
