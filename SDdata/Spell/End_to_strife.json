Upon casting the spell, an a divine aura, invisible to all, would be created around the cleric. All targets inside the holy zone would take damage when attacking others, but those outside were safe.\nOnly intelligent creatures could be affected by the spell, and those that were inside the zone were aware of the power of the spell. The cleric was able to choose if the damage taken in the zone was lethal or not, but only before the spell was cast."
