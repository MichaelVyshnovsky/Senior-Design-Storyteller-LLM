        "mainbody": "Sandstorm was an uncommon evocation spell of the southern magic tradition.\nThe spell created a vortex of sand. All creatures within 10 yards (9 meters) were blinded and took damage. Creatures trying to move would usually fall down. The spell also extinguished small fires or torches.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a fistful of sand."
