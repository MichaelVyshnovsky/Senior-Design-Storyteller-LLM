        "mainbody": "'''''Create watchghost''''' was a [[spell]] that created [[watchghost]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell allowed the caster to imbue a lifeless body with the spirit and intellect of its former self, binding it to their service until the caster's demise. The spell must be cast within five years of the corpse's passing. Once animated, the watchghost remained in a state of undeath until its eventual destruction.\n\nDuring the casting process, the caster issued specific commands to the watchghost. Each command could only entail a single task, explicitly defining the nature of the task, its manner of execution, and a single exemption, if applicable, to the commanded task.\n\nUpon the demise of the caster, the watchghost was released from its directives, free to wander with its original personality and consciousness contained within a potent [[undead]] vessel.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, [[diamond]] dust with a value of at least 1,500 [[gp]], four of the caster's teeth ground into a powder, and a handful of the caster's hair. These components established a connection between the caster's life force and the commands and servitude of the watchghost."
