        "mainbody": "Create watchghost was a spell that created watchghosts.\nWhen cast, this spell allowed the caster to imbue a lifeless body with the spirit and intellect of its former self, binding it to their service until the casters demise. The spell must be cast within five years of the corpses passing. Once animated, the watchghost remained in a state of undeath until its eventual destruction.\nDuring the casting process, the caster issued specific commands to the watchghost. Each command could only entail a single task, explicitly defining the nature of the task, its manner of execution, and a single exemption, if applicable, to the commanded task.\nUpon the demise of the caster, the watchghost was released from its directives, free to wander with its original personality and consciousness contained within a potent undead vessel.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, diamond dust with a value of at least 1,500 gp, four of the casters teeth ground into a powder, and a handful of the casters hair. These components established a connection between the casters life force and the commands and servitude of the watchghost."
