Spell sequencer was a spell used by wizards. The spell allowed a caster to save three spells.
When cast, the caster chose three spells to store for later use. When the caster accessed the spells, they were cast simultaneously. A caster could only cast one minor sequencer spell at a time. A caster was unable to use this spell to transfer stored spells to another individual.
