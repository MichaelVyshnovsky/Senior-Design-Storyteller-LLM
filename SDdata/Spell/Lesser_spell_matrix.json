Once placed, the stored spell was cast as a prepared spell. Once a spell was cast from the matrix, it was no longer stored. Dispel magic could break the magic matrix and removed any spell stored within. If the matrix enters an antimagic field, it was temporarily interupted until the caster emerged from the area of effect. If a caster was slain while the matrix was active, it collapsed and the stored spell was harmlessly dispelled.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a focus, a chunk of amber with a value of at least 500 gp."
