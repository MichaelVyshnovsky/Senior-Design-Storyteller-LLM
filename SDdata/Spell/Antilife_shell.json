        "mainbody": "'''''Antilife shell''''', also known as '''''anti-animal shell''''', was an [[abjuration]] spell that produced a hemispherical barrier that was impermeable to most types of living creatures.",
        "Effects": "The area protected by this spell was a {{SI|10|ft}} radius hemisphere centered on the caster and lasted almost two hours at a minimum (longer for higher level casters). For the older version called ''anti-animal shell'', the force field prevented entry of creatures that were at least partially animal. This included all [[humanoids]], [[beast]]s, [[magical beast]]s, [[giant]]s, [[vermin]], and hybrids like [[cambion]]s. The newer version added more lifeforms such as [[aberration]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[fey]], [[monstrous humanoid]]s, [[ooze]]s, [[plant creature|plant]]s, and [[shapechanger]]s to this list. Creatures that were unaffected by this spell included [[aerial servant]]s, [[imp]]s, [[quasit]]s, [[construct]]s (like [[golem]]s), [[elemental]]s, [[outsider]]s, or [[undead]].\n\nLike most abjuration spells, this one could not be used offensively to push a warded creature. Any such attempt resulted in the collapsing of the force field.\n\nWith the [[Second Sundering]] magic system lasting for a hour the caster had a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} barrier to hedge living creature. The spell would end if the caster moved so that a creature would have to pass the barrier.",
        "Components": "Both versions required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, plus the [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]] of the caster. The older version also required a handful of peppers.",
        "History": "It was recorded in ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy text of the [[church of Mielikki]].<ref>"
