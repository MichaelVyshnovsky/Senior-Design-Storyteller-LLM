Dark path was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Ibrandul, enabling them to easily move in complete darkness.
This spell allowed the recipient to move unhindered through complete darkness, allowing them to perceive their natural surroundings. Dark path did not help detect against invisible or magically silenced creatures. The spell also helped targets that were temporarily blinded. Any creature touching the target creature also received the benefits of the spell while contact was maintained. For this to work the creatures needed to be near the target when the spell was cast.
Anyone under the influence of the dark path risked being temporarily stunned if they came into contact with any light source brighter than a lantern.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a small piece of luminescent lichen to cast.
