        "mainbody": "Mordenkainens defense against lycanthropes was a spell that improved the chances of surviving an attack by lycanthropes.\nThe spell prevented the caster or a targeted creature from contracting lycanthropy. This was only successful if attacked after the spell was cast, as the spell did not offer this protection on a creature who was attacked before casting. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a moonstone with a value of at least 30 gp. It was crushed during casting."
