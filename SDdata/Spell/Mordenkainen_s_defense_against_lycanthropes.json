        "mainbody": "'''''Mordenkainen's defense against lycanthropes''''' was a [[spell]] that improved the chances of surviving an attack by [[lycanthrope]]s.",
        "Effects": "The spell prevented the caster or a targeted creature from contracting [[lycanthropy]]. This was only successful if attacked after the spell was cast, as the spell did not offer this protection on a creature who was attacked before casting.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a [[moonstone]] with a value of at least 30 [[gp]]. It was crushed during casting."
