Nathairs mischief was a spell used by bards, sorcerers, and wizards to disorient their opponents. 
This spell designated an area of effect, then randomly cycled through four possible effects, selecting one every ten minutes
*The area was filled with the smell of apple pie which charmed all creatures present
*Several bouquets of flowers appeared that squirted water at anyone who went near them
*Creatures in the area become incapacitated with giggling 
*The area was filled with floating droplets of molasses, making it hard to move
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was a piece of pie crust.
