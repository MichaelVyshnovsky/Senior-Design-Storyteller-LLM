Pebble wind was a spell that created a vertiginous mass of air. 
When cast, the spell acted in a similar fashion as the gust of wind spell, but with a key difference. Pebble wind not only belted a target with a strong wind, but created a whirlwind that picked up debris such as rocks and sand and even small items. This created a swirling cloud of detritus. The damage inflicted upon a creature was dependent on what type of debris loose soil inflicted little damage while pebbles and ricks inflicted more. If a creature was knocked over by the gusts of wind, they fell in a random direction.
This spell required only a verbal component.
