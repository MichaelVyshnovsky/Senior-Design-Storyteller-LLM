        "Effects": "This spell compelled a target to perform a specific task or be gravely injured. The target did not need to be visible to the caster if they were within range, but the caster did need to know their name or be able to recognize them.\n\nThe target felt a tingle near their heart as the caster held a blade, typically a dagger, when casting the spell. The sensation was followed by a mental command from the caster and the choice to either follow that command or perish. The command could be as vague or as detailed as the caster wished.\n\nTargets accepting the commanded task were known as \"bladed ones\". In order to check on the bladed one's progress the caster could establish mental contact with them at any time and see and hear what the target experienced. This could be maintained for as long as the caster concentrated. The spell also allowed the caster to ''[[teleport without error]]'' to the target's side a single time during the spell's duration.\n\nIf the bladed one died for any reason they would rise as a [[zombie]] and travel to the caster's location. When the caster touched the zombie it would then become a completely loyal servant for the caster.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a bladed weapon to cast. The weapon was consumed when the spell was cast."
