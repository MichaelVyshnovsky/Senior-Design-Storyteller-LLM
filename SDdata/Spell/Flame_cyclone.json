        "mainbody": "'''''Flame cyclone''''' is an [[evocation school|evocation]] [[spell]] used by inexperienced [[swordmage]]s, particularly those of the [[Swordmage#Assault Swordmage|assault]] style. When ''flame cyclone'' is cast a tempest of magical flame shoots from the swordmage's [[blade]], towards a nearby location, exploding into a flaming storm of fifteen feet in diameter. Creatures caught within are scorched by this blast, which dissipates within a few seconds and which is powered primarily by the strength and intelligence of the swordmage casting it. ''Flame cyclone'' wears somewhat heavily on its caster's power, meaning that before a swordmage can cast the spell again he or she must rest at least a few minutes.",
