Strategic charge was an abjuration spell that let one dodge blows better while armored. Originally, it was unique to blackguards and paladins of the Red Knight,
For a few seconds (longer for more experienced knights), the caster was able to move into or out of combat with less chance of injury from opponents taking the opportunity that such a move granted.
Only a verbal component and the use of the casters holy symbol or divine focus were needed to cast this spell.
