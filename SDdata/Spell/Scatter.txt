'''''Scatter''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that teleported several creatures to different nearby locations.

==Effects==
The spell targeted up to five creatures within a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and teleported those who failed to resist the effect each to a visible location of the caster's choice within a range of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}. The spell could not teleport anyone to a point in mid-air, however; it was necessary that a surface existed under every destination spot.

==Components==
The spell required only a [[verbal component]].
