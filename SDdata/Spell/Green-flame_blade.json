        "mainbody": "'''''Green-flame blade''''', also known as '''''greenflame blade''''', was an [[evocation]] spell that caused a burst of green fire to leap from a swinging [[melee weapons|melee weapon]].",
        "Effects": "As the spellcaster performed an attack with a weapon affected by the spell, green flame erupted from it towards a nearby foe. The deadliness of the spell increased as the spellcaster grew more powerful as the flames also increased the damage dealt by the weapon itself.\n\nSkilled [[swordmage]]s could launch these viridian flames at multiple nearby foes, and could use both their intellect as well as their physical strength as the basis for the spell's power.",
        "Components": "The spell required a quick [[Verbal component|verbal]] as well as the weapon to be enhanced as the [[material component]].",
        "History": "Prior to the [[Second Sundering]], the spell was favored by swordmages, particularly so-called \"[[Swordmage#Shielding Swordmage|assault swordmages]]\" who employed flashy elemental [[magic]]s in their fighting styles.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the spell was popular among [[War Wizard of Cormyr|War Wizards of Cormyr]] and [[bladesinger]]s. [[Warlock]]s taking the [[pact of the blade]] also favored this spell."
