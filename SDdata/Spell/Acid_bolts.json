        "mainbody": "Acid bolts was an evocation spell used by wizards.\nWith this spell the caster could shoot a teardrop-shaped glob of acid from each hand. If the caster could see the target then the acid bolts would always strike true, dousing them in painful corrosive acid. A bolt would pursue and strike a fleeing target who ran outside of the casters view after the bolt was released, dodging around objects in its path to the target.\nThis spell had no effect on the undead or non-living material.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
