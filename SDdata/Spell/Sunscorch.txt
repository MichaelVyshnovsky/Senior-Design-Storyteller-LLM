'''''Sunscorch''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that brought down a lance of blistering heat from the sky to smite a single target. This divine spell was granted to [[druid]]s, [[ranger]]s, [[Morninglord]]s of [[Lathander]], and [[Silverstar]]s of [[Selûne]].

==Effects==
When the spell was uttered, a single creature within {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} from the caster was blasted with a brilliant and hot ray of light. Its damage was more devastating when conjured by casters of higher power levels and experience. The light was especially dangerous to the [[undead]] and creatures with eyes could be blinded temporarily.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to be cast.
