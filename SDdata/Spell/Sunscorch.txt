Sunscorch was an evocation spell that brought down a lance of blistering heat from the sky to smite a single target. This divine spell was granted to druids, rangers, Morninglords of Lathander, and Silverstars of Sel√ªne.
When the spell was uttered, a single creature within  from the caster was blasted with a brilliant and hot ray of light. Its damage was more devastating when conjured by casters of higher power levels and experience. The light was especially dangerous to the undead and creatures with eyes could be blinded temporarily.
The spell required verbal and somatic components to be cast.
