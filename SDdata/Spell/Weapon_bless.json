        "mainbody": "Weapon bless was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nA shugenja used this spell to bless a weapon against a particular creature. The target creature had to be clearly identified and precise, by either name or location. The weapon can be used to strike creatures who had immunity to non-magical weapons. But if the weapons is used against any other creature then the targeted individual, the spell was broken.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, ink made from the blood of a dragon and a brush. During casting, the shugenja used these items to write the blessings on the weapon."
