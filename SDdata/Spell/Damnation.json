        "mainbody": "Damnation was an enchantment spell of epic magic, developed by or granted to some of the most powerful clerics, favored souls, Harper agents, sacred fists, warlocks, and warpriests, who were masters of spellcraft and could access the 9 circle of magic.\nWhen the spellcaster touched a target creature, it was instantaneously transported to one of the layers of the Nine Hells or the Abyss. The target of the spell also was affected by a compulsion for the twenty following hours, forcing it to be unwilling to leave the Hells or the Abyss, making them believe that being in there was naught but a reward for their ill actions. Only creatures with truly epic levels of will could resist being condemned to the Hells. Those fortuitous enough to resist damnation were dazed and exhausted by the experience.\nTo cast damnation, the caster had to use verbal and Somatic components and pay for the casting with a share of their own power and life experiences to be lost forever.\nDeveloping the damnation spell was an arduous and expensive process. It took eighteen days and 873,000 gp, as well as usage of the following spells foresee, to observe the hellscape to be the spells destination transport and compel."
