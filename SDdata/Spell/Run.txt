Run was an uncommon alteration spell of the southern magic tradition.
The spell affected a single creature, and would cause them to run at triple their normal ground speed. Any creature could be targeted, including summoned creatures. The spell was not cumulative, so it had no additional effect on any being affected by other spells such as haste. The spell had no effect on the speed of burrowing, climbing, flying, or swimming. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a rabbits foot.
