Demiplane was a conjuration spell that created or reconnected with a demiplane.
The caster created a shady door fit for medium creatures that would lead to or create a demiplane of about 30 cubic feet with wood or stone surfaces. The shady door would last for an hour, and after that time, the door would disappear and whatever was inside would be stuck there until the plane was reconnected. If the caster had knowledge of the nature and contents of a demiplane, she could create the door to that one. If no demiplane was "picked", then a new one would be made.
Only a somatic component was needed for casting the spell.
The artifact known as the Orrery of the Wanderer was capable of mimicking the effects of this spell.
