Amber prison was a spell used by clerics of Rillifane Rallathil.
When cast, this spell covered a targeted creature in a thick layer of fossilized resin. The resin had a variety of colors, ranging from orange to yellow, and even yellow with a brownish hue. 
The resin took a bit of time to harden, so the targeted creature had a chance to escape. Once hardened, however, only a significant physical blow could shatter the resin. A shatter spell caused the hardened resin to crumble instantly. While hardened, the resin allowed little air to pass through, which would slowly suffocate any creature trapped inside.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the holy symbol of Rillifane Rallathil, a piece of amber with a value of at least 100 gp, and a single drop of tree sap.
