'''''Amber prison''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Rillifane Rallathil]].
 
==Effects==
When cast, this spell covered a targeted creature in a thick layer of fossilized resin. The resin had a variety of colors, ranging from orange to yellow, and even yellow with a brownish hue. 

The resin took a bit of time to harden, so the targeted creature had a chance to escape. Once hardened, however, only a significant physical blow could shatter the resin. A ''[[shatter]]'' spell caused the hardened resin to crumble instantly. While hardened, the resin allowed little air to pass through, which would slowly suffocate any creature trapped inside.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the [[holy symbol]] of Rillifane Rallathil, a piece of [[amber]] with a value of at least 100 [[gp]], and a single drop of tree sap.
