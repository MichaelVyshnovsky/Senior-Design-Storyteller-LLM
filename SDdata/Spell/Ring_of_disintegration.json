        "mainbody": "Ring of disintegration was a spell unique to Halruaa.\nThis spell created a small bit of disintegrating matter. Upon impact this bit grew to a 6 inch circlet.\nTargets struck by this circlet suffer intense pain and immediately lose an appendage, determined at random. Larger creatures only suffered from the pain and did not lose an appendage.\nThis spell required a silver bracelet to cast. The bracelet needed to be worth at least 100 gp and have a bit of mithril worked into the silver. The bracelet was consumed once the spell was cast."
