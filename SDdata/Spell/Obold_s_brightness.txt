'''''Obold's brightness''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the school of [[evocation]] created by [[Obold]]. Obold initially created this spell to deal with [[orc]]s attacking his mountain tower.

==Effects==
This spell created a thick smoky cloud that glowed bright white and was riddled with sparks that were actually small bolts of lightning. The lightning struck any target within the cloud.

When formed the cloud appeared as a hemisphere resting on the ground. The caster could move the cloud about quickly for the spell's duration.

The effects of ''Obold's brightness'' could be neutralized by the use of a mundane but potent [[lodestone]]. The stone's natural property to attract lightning swiftly drained the spell's energies when tossed into its cloud.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a tangle of [[wire]] and scrap of fur to cast.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, ''Obold's brightness'' was recorded in a rare tome â€“ ''[[Obold's Spellbook]]''. It's contents were among many arcane tomes that were studied by the [[Jordaini]]s of [[Halruaa]] in order to counter the spells' effects.
