Obolds brightness was a wizard spell from the school of evocation created by Obold. Obold initially created this spell to deal with orcs attacking his mountain tower.
This spell created a thick smoky cloud that glowed bright white and was riddled with sparks that were actually small bolts of lightning. The lightning struck any target within the cloud.
When formed the cloud appeared as a hemisphere resting on the ground. The caster could move the cloud about quickly for the spells duration.
The effects of Obolds brightness could be neutralized by the use of a mundane but potent lodestone. The stones natural property to attract lightning swiftly drained the spells energies when tossed into its cloud.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a tangle of wire and scrap of fur to cast.
By the , Obolds brightness was recorded in a rare tome â€“ Obolds Spellbook. Its contents were among many arcane tomes that were studied by the Jordainis of Halruaa in order to counter the spells effects.
