'''''Snowblind'''''<ref group="note">The spell was clearly named after [[wikipedia:en:Snowblind_Studios|Snowblind Studios]], who produced ''[[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]]''. was a short-range ice breath [[spell]].

==Effects==
This spell was very similar to ''[[burning hands]]'', but was essentially a cold version. As such, the user would release a cone of ice. However, it was more powerful, dealing more damage, but also draining more of the user's energy.

==History==
This spell was known to be used around [[1374 DR]], particularly by the [[elf]] [[sorceress]], [[Adrianna]].
