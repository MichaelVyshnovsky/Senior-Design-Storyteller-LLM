        "mainbody": "Firebrand was a spell used by sorcerers and wizards.\nWhen cast, this spell covered an area with a  radius in a mass of burning flame. Any creature caught within the burst of flame was burned. The caster was able to fire multiple bursts in different spots as far as  from their location. Both the range and the strength of this spell was determined by the casters skill level.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a vial of alchemists fire."
