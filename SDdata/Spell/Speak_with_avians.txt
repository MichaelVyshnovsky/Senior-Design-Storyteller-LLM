Speak with avians was a divine spell that could be prayed for by followers of Aerdrie Faenya, the Winged Mother. It allowed the caster to briefly converse with a normal bird or a natural giant variety of avian.
This spell was cast upon oneself, not an avian, and allowed the caster to communicate for two minutes with one chosen avian within 30 ft (9.1 m). Higher level priests could converse for longer periods of time. The creature had to have at least animal intelligence to converse and cooperation was not guaranteed. If the bird was agreeable or of the same alignment, it might perform a service for the caster. This spell did not influence or enhance the avian in any way, so answers to questions could be evasive, inane, direct, reluctant, withheld, intelligent, stupid, true, or false, depending on the nature of the creature and the persuasiveness of the questioner.
This spell did not work on monstrous or magical avians, such as the peryton only on natural birds and their giant varieties, such as ravens, doves, eagles, giant eagles, etc.
This spell was spoken with somatic gestures. No material components were required (other than the priests holy symbol).
