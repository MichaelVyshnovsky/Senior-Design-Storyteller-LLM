        "mainbody": "An '''avenger''', sometimes also called a '''dark knight''', was an agent of one or more [[deity|god]]s who sought to bring divine wrath unto the enemies of their divine patron. It was also the name given to [[paladin]]s who followed the '''Oath of Vengeance''', swearing to hunt down and punish those who had committed grievous sins.",
        "Activities": "Some avengers served as well-crafted weapons of their deity. Invested with traditions both ancient and quite often secret, they hunted the enemies of their faith and struck them down. Of all a god's agents, they were the most deadly, marked and empowered by rituals of investiture similar but not identical to those that which marked the training of a [[cleric]] or paladin.\n\nOther paladins took up the oath of an avenger in response to witnessing great evils or injustices, committing themselves to punishing those responsible even at the expense of their own purity or righteousness.\n\nThe nature of the targets of an avenger's enmity varied based on their religion or their oath.",
        "Culture": "Most avengers were sworn to the service of a god, but some were known to serve multiple gods or none at all, instead drawing power from their divinely-inspired mission of vengeance.\n\nOrganized groups of avengers were not a part of every faith. This was for the simple reason that the work of an avenger was abhorrent to pacifists as they were often seen as mere killers who simply happened to serve on behalf of the divine. Members of their own religion might be as likely to view avengers as heretics, as champions, or perhaps only as an unpleasant necessity. As a result, many avenger traditions were so secretive that they were largely forgotten by the uninitiated. This was not a problem for avengers, whose methodology required a degree of focus that made outside distractions unwanted. Most avengers were, in fact, trained in [[monasteries]] akin to those used by [[monk]]s.\n\nGiven that their duties were contrary at times to the mandate of a god with a forgiving or compassionate nature, avengers most commonly served deities that were [[neutral]] or [[unaligned]] or even [[evil]] rather than those that were outwardly [[good]]. Meanwhile, orders of evil avengers dedicated to the likes of [[Asmodeus]], [[Lolth]], or [[Zehir]] were also said to exist. Avengers were often also aligned along the lines of ancient feuds between the gods, seeking out the worshipers of their patron's rival or enemy.\n\nThe mightiest of avengers might seek to pursue more lofty paths, such as that of the [[Hammer of Judgment]]&mdash;dedicated to making oneself a more well-rounded tool for their god rather than a mere weapon&mdash;or the [[Unveiled Visage]]&mdash;in which the avenger would come to slowly take on the face and aspect of their divine patron. Additionally, more powerful and sinister sects of avengers were said to exist, such as the [[Oathsworn]]&mdash;whose mere words carried divine weight&mdash;and the so-called [[Zealous Assassin]]s&mdash;who embraced stealth and secrecy to eliminate their god's enemies.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Avenger Variants": "All avengers were trained to focus their mind, body, and soul towards the goal of eliminating the foes of their god. However, how they did this varied from avenger to avenger, though most followed one of the following paths:"
        },
        "Relationships": "Avengers were largely defined by their enemies. While those who swore their own Oaths of Vengeance defined these enemies for themselves, those who belonged to a god's church had their enemies defined for them. For example:\n* Avengers of Bahamut were said to hunt [[chromatic dragon]]s and followers of Tiamat, but also to oppose unjust leaders and even everyday liars and bullies.\n* Avengers of Corellon were said to hunt [[drow]] followers of Lolth as well as [[fomorian]]s and any who would threaten or destroy beauty or [[magic]].\n* Avengers of Moradin were said to hunt cultists dedicated to evil [[primordial]]s, traditional dwarven enemies such as [[azer]]s and [[duergar]], as well as traitors or those who would leach off dwarven society.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Harper]]s were known to recruit avengers as agents.\n\nFollowing the [[Second Sundering]], a few paladins of the [[Order of the Gilded Eye]] followed the Oath of Vengeance. The order safeguarded [[Helm's Hold]] at the edge of [[Neverwinter Wood]]."
