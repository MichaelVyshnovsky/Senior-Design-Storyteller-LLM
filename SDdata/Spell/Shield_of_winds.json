        "Effects": "This spell created an invisible windy barrier by creating strands of chaotic gusts of wind, resulting in a nearly impenetrable wall. Only purely magical weapons such as [[magic missle|''magic missle'']]''s'' could pass through the wall. Enchanted objects like arrows were stopped in their tracks. Either [[dispel magic|''dispel magic'']] or [[anti-magic shell|''anti-magic shell'']] could destroy the wall.",
        "Components": "This spell only required the presence of air to cast."
