'''''Magic resistance''''' was a spell unique to [[Maztica]]. The spell allowed a caster to cancel out all magical effects within an area.

==Effects==
This spell was similar to the ''[[minor globe of invulnerability]]'' spell used in [[Faer√ªn]]. Any magical effect within the spell's range was nullified. This included spells that targeted the caster, magical abilities and magical items and their effects. The spell's effects could be broken by using a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell on the affected area.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a small image of [[Qotal]] made from clay. This image was destroyed during casting.
