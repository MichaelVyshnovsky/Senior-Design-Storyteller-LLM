Magic resistance was a spell unique to Maztica. The spell allowed a caster to cancel out all magical effects within an area.
This spell was similar to the minor globe of invulnerability spell used in Faer√ªn. Any magical effect within the spells range was nullified. This included spells that targeted the caster, magical abilities and magical items and their effects. The spells effects could be broken by using a dispel magic spell on the affected area.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small image of Qotal made from clay. This image was destroyed during casting.
