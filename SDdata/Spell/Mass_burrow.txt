'''''Mass burrow''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that worked like the ''[[burrow]]'' spell.

==Effects==
As mentioned above, ''mass burrow'' worked like the ''burrow'' spell. The difference between these two spells lay in the scale. The caster could enchant more than one creature, the number of which increased with the caster's skill, and they did not need to touch them. The creatures needed to be within 30 feet (9 meters).

==Components==
''Mass burrow'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s, but also a focus in the form of a claw of a burrowing [[animal]], when the caster cast the spell as an arcane one. Divine casters needed to substitute the focus with a [[divine focus]].
