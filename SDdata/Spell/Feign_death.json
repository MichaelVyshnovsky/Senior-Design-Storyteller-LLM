        "Effects": "There was an [[arcane magic|arcane]] and a [[divine magic|divine]] version of this spell and both had the effect of putting the recipient into a cataleptic state with rigid muscles and posture, unresponsive pupils, and lack of respiration and vital signs. The recipient could hear, smell, and be aware of what was happening in their immediate environment, but could not see or feel anything. Reaction to wounds or mistreatment of their body was impossible, but damage was reduced to half and they were immune to poison, paralysis, and energy drain while ''feigning''. Any poison introduced into the body would attempt to overcome the target's resistance and begin to take effect once the spell had worn off.\n\nThe arcane version of this spell could affect any willing creature that was not higher level than the caster and lasted a minimum of almost two hours or until ended by the caster. (The older arcane version of this spell lasted only a few minutes.) For the divine version of ''feign death'', any willing person (not creature) could be the recipient regardless of level and it lasted a minimum of 15 minutes or until released by the caster. For all versions of this spell, recovery time to full bodily function and movement took one minute. If cast on an unwilling person or creature, this spell had no effect.\n\nAfter the [[Second Sundering]] there was only a single version. This version worked the same as the previous once but it could affect any willing creature, and lasted a hour.",
        "Components": "For the arcane versions of this spell, only verbal and somatic components were required. The newer divine version only had a verbal component. Previously, the divine spell required a pinch of dirt from a graveyard and the priest's [[holy symbol]].",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Gwynn]] in {{Yearlink|-909}} and was originally known as ''Gwynn's feign death''.",
        "Usage": "The spell was available to [[cleric]]s of [[Karsus]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/104/Forgotten Deities: Karsus|4}}"
