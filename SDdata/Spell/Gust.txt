Gust was a transmutation cantrip that controlled a small volume of air for a brief moment.
The spell commanded a small volume of air within  of the caster to move in a variety of ways. It could create a harmless small breeze that rustled leaves or moved the casters clothing, but was also capable of stronger effects, such as slamming windows shut. It could also push an unattended object or even a creature a small distance away from the caster. None of those effects was strong enough to cause damage by itself.
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
