'''''Exterminate''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that neophyte [[wizard]]s could learn. It killed a small insect, rodent, or other common pest.

==Effects==
This spell only worked on non-magical creatures. It did not affect creatures that had been ''[[polymorph]]ed'' or were the subject of a ''[[shrink animal]]'' or ''[[shrink insect]]'' spell.<ref group="note">The ''[[Unearthed Arcana 1st edition]]'' allowed this spell to work against magically created and magically shrunk creatures (but not ''polymorphed''), but the ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' reversed this. The [[Dragon magazine 59|''Dragon'' #59]] article did not address this aspect of the spell. It was effective on common vermin such as a [[mouse]], a [[rat]], a [[beetle]], or a [[fly (insect)|fly]]. If the target was sufficiently small, such as tiny [[ant]]s or [[flea]]s, a volume of up to {{SI|0.5|cu ft|c|long=yes}} could be made free of that pest.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster pointed a finger at the desired target and made a soft ''"zzzt"'' sound.

==History==
This cantrip was described in the untitled [[spellbook]] normally called ''[[Briel's Book of Shadows]]'', along with three others.{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|34}}<ref group="note">The 1{{st}} edition version of ''Briel's Book of Shadows'' was described in [[Dragon magazine 97|''Dragon'' #97]] and had the cantrips ''exterminate'', ''[[smokepuff]]'', ''[[tie]]'', and ''[[wilt]]''. These were replaced by the 2{{nd}} edition ''cantrip'' spell in ''[[Pages from the Mages]]''.
