Exterminate was a useful cantrip that neophyte wizards could learn. It killed a small insect, rodent, or other common pest.
This spell only worked on non-magical creatures. It did not affect creatures that had been polymorphed or were the subject of a shrink animal or shrink insect spell.The Unearthed Arcana 1st edition allowed this spell to work against magically created and magically shrunk creatures (but not polymorphed), but the Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four reversed this. The Dragon #59 article did not address this aspect of the spell. It was effective on common vermin such as a mouse, a rat, a beetle, or a fly. If the target was sufficiently small, such as tiny ants or fleas, a volume of up to  could be made free of that pest.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster pointed a finger at the desired target and made a soft "zzzt" sound.
This cantrip was described in the untitled spellbook normally called Briels Book of Shadows, along with three others.The 1 edition version of Briels Book of Shadows was described in Dragon #97 and had the cantrips exterminate, smokepuff, tie, and wilt. These were replaced by the 2 edition cantrip spell in Pages from the Mages.
