'''''Earthenport''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Grumbar]], enabling them to attune to the rocks surrounding them.

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to use the rocks surrounding them as ''[[teleport]]'' gateways provided the rocks had at least as much volume as the caster and their equipment. This allowed the caster to safely teleport to any rocky location on the same [[plane]]. It took the caster ten minutes to arrive at their new destination when using this spell.

The caster was susceptible to harm and being stunned from spells such as ''[[dig]], [[stone shape]]'', and ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'' while using ''earthenport''.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
