        "mainbody": "Ringweave was a wizard spell from the schools of alteration and evocation.\nWith this spell, the caster could duplicate the powers of any magic ring they had ever used. The ring in question did not need to be in the casters possession and they did not need to know how the ring functioned. The number of times the caster could use the duplicated effect depended on their skill level unless the spell expired first. The spell lasted for weeks at a time depending on the casters skill. When used, the effect would erupt from any item that the caster choose when casting the spell. The spell would end if this item was destroyed.\nA successful dispel magic on the item only prevented the item from functioning for several minutes depending on the skill of the dispelling caster. The caster of ringweave need not have the item on their person, so could effectively use the items power if it was carefully hidden nearby in order to protect it from discovery.\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast."
