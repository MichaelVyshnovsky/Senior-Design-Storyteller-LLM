Pain was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
A wu jen used this spell to inflict intense agonizing pain on a creature. Multiple creatures could be targeted, as long as they were within 20 feet (6 meters) of each other. The pain subsided instantly, but targeted creatures were left with contorted muscles and in a weakened state. Prestidigitation or strength cancelled the effects of this spell.  
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a leech and stone rubbed against a piece of slate.
