        "mainbody": "Castigate was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nA shugenja used this spell to deliver a scathing condemnation upon a creature. Creatures of the same alignment as the shugenja were temporarily deafened, while creatures of a different alignment suffered damage, especially creatures of an opposite alignment.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, the holy symbol of the shugenja."
