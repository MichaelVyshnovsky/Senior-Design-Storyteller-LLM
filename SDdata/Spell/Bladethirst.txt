'''''Bladethirst''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that greatly increased the accuracy of any slashing [[weapon]] designated by the caster. It could be found within the [[book|tome]] ''[[Sabirine's Specular]]'', the [[spellbook]] of the noted [[mage]] of [[the North]], [[Sabirine]].

==Description==
A weapon affected by ''bladethirst'' began to glow with a blue-white fire.

==Effects==
Upon the spell's casting, any single-bladed slashing weapon was granted a ''+3 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]'', cumulative with any existing [[magic]]al enhancement, allowing its wielder to strike with greater precision. It did not however increase the skill of the wielder, nor did it make their slashing attacks any more damaging.

Only one casting of the spell could affect a weapon at one time, and the effects could not be affected by the spell ''[[permanency]]''.

==Casting==
The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s, the latter being a single drop of blood and a small pinch of silver powder.
