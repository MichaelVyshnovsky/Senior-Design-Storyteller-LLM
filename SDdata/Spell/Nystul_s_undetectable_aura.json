        "mainbody": "Nystuls undetectable aura was a common spell used by merchant princes, sorcerers and wizards across Faer√ªn.\nWhen cast, the spell allowed a caster to hide an items magical aura, allowing the nature of the item to be undetectable to spells. If identify was used on the item, it would reveal that the aura was hidden or false, and the items properties became known.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, which was a piece of silk cut into a square. During casting, the caster had to glide the silk over the target object.\nThe spell was used on the magical weapon Azuredge. The spell hid the weapons magical properties."
