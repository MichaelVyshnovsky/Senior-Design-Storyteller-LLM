        "mainbody": "'''''Nystul's undetectable aura''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[merchant prince]]s, [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s across [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell allowed a caster to hide an item's [[magic]]al aura, allowing the nature of the item to be undetectable to spells. If ''[[identify]]'' was used on the item, it would reveal that the aura was hidden or false, and the item's properties became known.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], which was a piece of silk cut into a square. During casting, the caster had to glide the silk over the target object.",
        "History": "The spell was used on the magical [[weapon]] ''[[Azuredge]]''. The spell hid the weapon's magical properties."
