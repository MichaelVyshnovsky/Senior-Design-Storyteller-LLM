Poison was a type of giant rune that allowed the caster to detect poison in liquids.
If an inscribed vessel came into contact with any form of poison it would instantly burst and shatter, thereby alerting those nearby to the poisons presence.
Like most giant runes, it required no material components to cast. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to four hours. The rune needed to be inscribed upon a liquid-bearing vessel, such as a plate, dish, bowl, mug, or glass.
The poison rune was known to be used extensively by many giant leaders, as they wanted to remain vigilant against any chance of treachery.
