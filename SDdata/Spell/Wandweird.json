        "Effects": "This spell created an invisible sphere centered on the caster that moved with them, protecting them from any attacks from enemy [[wand]]s. The caster's wands were also prevented from working as well within the sphere. Harmful effects from wands outside of the sphere simply exploded against the surface without penetrating before they were absorbed. Other wand effects were simply absorbed by the sphere.\n\nAll absorbed energy could be released at a target of the caster's choosing in a blast of pure magical energy when the spell expired. An enemy who managed to successfully dispel the sphere would find the stored energy released at them immediately.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]] a piece of wood resembling a wand to cast. The caster needed to cast any spell into the wood before using it for the ''wandweird''."
