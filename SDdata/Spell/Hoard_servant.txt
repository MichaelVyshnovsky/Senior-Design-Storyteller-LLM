Hoard servant was a conjuration spell that functioned in a similar manner to unseen servant but was only available to the dragons of Toril. It was popular among metallic and gem dragons, as they were much more preoccupied with the status of their horde of treasures.
By casting this spell, a dragon summoned an invisible unseen servant that was stronger and more hearty than its humanoid-conjured counterpart. The unseen servant stayed near the hoard of the summoning dragon, stacking coins, organizing chests, and polishing all the gems and items cast from precious metals.
The duration of the spell lasted for a matter of hours, depending on the spellcasting skill and experience of the caster.
