'''''Wall of fog''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that filled a volume with obscuring vapors.

==Effects==
The spell created a mist of vapors in a volume up to a cube 20 ft (6.1 m) on a side, but no thinner than 10 ft (3 m) within a range of up to 30 yd (27 m). The mist completely obscured both normal vision and [[infravision]] beyond 2 ft (61 cm) into the volume. More powerful wizards could increase the volume of mist produced. It lasted for about three minutes, but could be dispersed by a moderate or strong wind.

Since the spell created air along with the vapors, it could be used to renew the air supply of a [[spelljammer]] that had spent too long in [[wildspace]]. Any excess air that could not fit within the air envelope escaped to space. Despite the temporary obscuring effect, the new air created remained even after the spell's duration.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was a pinch of split dried peas.

==History==
The spell was attributed to the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Veridon]] in {{Yearlink|-460}}, originally called '''''Veridon's wall'''''.
