Slashing darkness was a divine evocation spell that shot forth a ribbon of pure darkness from the caster.
The dark swathe of energy created by this spell hissed as it flew from the casters hand. It was quite harmful to living beings but had curative effects on undead creatures.
The casting of this spell required only verbal and somatic components.
