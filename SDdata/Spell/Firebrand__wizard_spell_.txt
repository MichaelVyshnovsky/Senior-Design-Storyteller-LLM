Firebrand was an arcane evocation spell that created a flame that burned for the spells duration without consuming the object it was cast upon.
Once cast upon an object or spot, the fire could not be moved but the caster could extinguish the flame at any time. This spell was useful when cast upon a weapon to temporarily transform it into a flaming version without actually damaging the weapon. The firebrand flames would even burn underwater. A caster could also cover part of their body, or an allys, with flames that would not harm them.
The reverse of this spell, quenchtouch, created black flames upon an object that would extinguish any other flame that it came into contact with.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material components a flame and a pinch of sulphur to cast.
Quenchtouch required a drop of water to cast.
This spell was found within Shandarils Workbook.
