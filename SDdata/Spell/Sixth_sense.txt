Sixth sense was a spell used by clerics of Corellon Larethian.
This spell gave the caster the ability to detect unexpected danger, up to  from the caster, towards themself or their allies. The spell did reveal the exact nature of the threat, just a sense of impending danger.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Corellon Larethian and a single drop of sweat.
