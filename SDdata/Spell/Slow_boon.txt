Slow boon was a divine necromancy spell that slowly healed injuries that the subject had suffered.
The slow boon spell simply applied a slow rate of healing to the subject until the spell expired. If the subject was fully healed before this time, then they could transfer the remainder of the spell to another willing creature by skin-to-skin contact.
The spell required a fragment of bone painted with the holy symbol of Ilmater, the Broken God. This piece could come from any creature and be of any size.
The slow boon spell appeared within the Tome of Torment, the holiest book of the church of Ilmater, which first appeared in the Realms in 848 DR.
