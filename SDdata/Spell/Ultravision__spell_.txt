Ultravision was a transmutation spell cast by bards, clerics, druids, rangers, sorcerers, and wizards.
This spell gave the target the ability to see in darkness. This ability functioned both in natural darkness, as well as that created by the spell darkness. The spells duration depended on the power of the caster but could be calculated in hours.
The spell required verbal and somatic components to cast.
