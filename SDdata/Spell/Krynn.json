The meeting marked the formation of the [[Free Space Alliance]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Rumors existed of a ''[[gate]]'' connecting the northern region of [[The Sword]] in [[Anauroch]] on [[Toril]] to an unspecified location on Krynn. This rumor was due to [[adventurer]]s on Toril reported encounters in that region with a variety of creatures that were native to Krynn. These included [[hatori]], [[horax]], [[skrit]]s, and [[tylor]]s.\n\nThere was an ancient tale from Krynn that spoke of a horrific bat-like creature from the sky that caused immense destruction. These legends indicated that the ''[[Batship]]'' passed through Krynnspace on its journey to Realmspace.",
        "Inhabitants": "[[Gnome]] colonists from Krynn were credited with the creation of the many varieties of [[giant space hamster]]s that could be found in numerous crystal spheres. These colonists were also partially responsible for the proliferation of [[firearm]]s throughout the Known Spheres.{{Cite dragon/232/Sorcerous Six-Shooters|37}}\n\nFew people of Krynn ever traveled to Toril or even Realmspace, but there have been some notable exceptions:\n* [[Teldin Moore]], master of the [[Cloak of the First Pilot]], was one of the few humans to ever be permitted a visit to [[Evermeet]].\n* [[Gaeadrelle Goldring]], a half-[[kender]], traveled with Teldin Moore for a time and visited the [[Rock of Bral]].\n* [[Jasmine]], a human adventurer of [[Westgate]] who traveled both the [[Cosmology|planes]] and the [[Crystal sphere|spheres]] and had a strange set of magical wings, was also born on Krynn.\n* [[Emilo Haversack]], a kender, was an adventuring companion of Jasmine's.\n* [[Dalamar|Dalamar the Dark]], a [[wizard]] from Krynn, was a good friend of [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] and [[Mordenkainen]] of [[Oerth]], and the three used to meet somewhat regularly in the home of [[Ed Greenwood|Ed of the Greenwood]] on [[Earth]].{{Cite dragon/219/The Wizards Three: Warmer Than Expected}}\n\nTakhisis, one of the three prime gods of Krynn, was noted to be extremely similar in portfolio and appearance to the Torilian goddess [[Tiamat]], though their exact relationship was unknown.<ref> A similar connection was suspected but not completely understood between Krynn's leading deity of good, Paladine, and draconic deity [[Bahamut]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/143/Sage Advice}}"
