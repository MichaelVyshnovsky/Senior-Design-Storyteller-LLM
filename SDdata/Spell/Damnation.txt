'''''Damnation''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] of [[epic magic]], developed by or granted to some of the most powerful [[cleric]]s, [[favored soul]]s, [[Harper agent]]s, [[sacred fist]]s, [[warlock]]s, and [[warpriest]]s, who were masters of spellcraft and could access the 9{{th}} circle of magic.

==Effects==
When the spellcaster touched a target creature, it was instantaneously transported to one of the layers of the [[Nine Hells]] or the [[Abyss]]. The target of the spell also was affected by a [[compulsion]] for the twenty following hours, forcing it to be unwilling to leave the Hells or the Abyss, making them believe that being in there was naught but a reward for their ill actions. Only creatures with truly epic levels of will could resist being condemned to the Hells. Those fortuitous enough to resist ''damnation'' were dazed and exhausted by the experience.

==Components==
To cast ''damnation'', the caster had to use [[verbal]] and [[Somatic component]]s and pay for the casting with a share of their own power and life experiences to be lost forever.

==Creation==
Developing the ''damnation'' spell was an arduous and expensive process. It took eighteen days and 873,000 [[gp]], as well as usage of the following spells: ''[[foresee]]'', to observe the hellscape to be the spell's destination; ''[[transport]]''; and ''[[compel]]''.
