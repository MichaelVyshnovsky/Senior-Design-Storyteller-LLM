        "mainbody": "'''''False dawn''''' was a [[spell]] that was commonly used by [[cleric]]s of [[Lathander]].",
        "Effects": "A caster used this spell to mimic a normal rising of the sun. The spell created a bright light that resembled the rising sun. The light was bright enough to dispel darkness-based spells. This spell not only harmed creatures sensitive to light, but also inflicted a state of confusion upon them. [[Undead]] creatures were particularly vulnerable to this spell. If this spell killed an undead creature, it did not reanimate. Creatures who used [[infravision]] were unable to do so for a short period after exposure to the light from this spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a [[gem]] with a value of at least 1000 [[gp]]. The gemstone could be red, transparent, or yellow in hue. It was consumed during casting."
