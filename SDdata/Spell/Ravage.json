        "mainbody": "Ravage was a divine necromancy spell that conjured forth a column of vile energy that rendered the spirit and body of any people or creatures caught within.\nThe swirling, black energy that was created by this spell encompassed an area 10 (3 m) in radius and 40 (12.2 m) in height. Any living beings caught within received significant wounds that affected both their body and soul. These injuries could only be healed by magic cast within an area that had been consecrated or was otherwise considered hallowed ground.\nThose who possessed a heroic resilience were able to resists this damage outright.\nThe casting of this spell required verbal and somatic components, as well as the use of a divine focus."
