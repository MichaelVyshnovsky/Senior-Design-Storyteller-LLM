        "mainbody": "Halasters fetch III was a conjuration spell that functioned exactly as summon monster III, except that the conjured creatures did not disappear when its duration was over. Rather, they regained their free will and continued their existence outside the control of the caster.\nThis spell was invented and developed by the \"Mad Mage\" of the Undermountain, Halaster Blackcloak."
