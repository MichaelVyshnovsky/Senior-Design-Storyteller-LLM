'''''Power word, disable''''', was a powerful [[spell]] from the [[enchantment]] school that could be wielded by both [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
After the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the spell was able to either bring an opponent to the brink of death or make them collapse unconscious. In both cases, the vital energies of the target were brought to near full depletion.

The spell only worked on creatures, under a certain average degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the [[Arcane magic|spellcaster]]. 

==Components==
The spell required only a [[verbal component]], the uttering of the power word itself.

==Usage==
As of the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], the spell was used by people in [[Rashemen]]<ref> and [[Samarach]],<ref> and on the [[Dragon Coast]]<ref> and [[Sword Coast North]].
