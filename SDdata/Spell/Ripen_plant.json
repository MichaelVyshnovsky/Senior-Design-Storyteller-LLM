        "mainbody": "Ripen plant was a divine alteration spell that caused a living plant to mature and age until it reached a state of ripeness.\nWhen this spell was cast, the affected plant aged for ten minutes, until it became fully ripe and its flowers and fruit bloomed.\nIf ripen plant was cast upon a magically-controlled plant, it functioned as per the hold plant spell.\nThe specifications of the spell were inscribed upon one of the \"inner petals\" of the Chauntean relic, the Glarathra.\nIn order to be cast, ripen plant required verbal and somatic components."
