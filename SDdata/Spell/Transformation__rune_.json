        "mainbody": "ransformation was a type of giant rune that that allowed the wielder of its inscribed object to transform their appearance.\nThose who wore the inscribed article of clothing were granted access to an effect equivalent to the spell Polymorph self, though it would only function if worn by the caster. The duration of this effect was a number of minutes equal to twice the casters level.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to six hours and it needed to be inscribed upon an article of clothing."
