'''''Camouflage''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that caused the caster to blend in with the colors of their surroundings.

==Effects==
As mentioned above, ''camouflage'' allowed the caster to blend in with the surrounding. This was done by changing the caster's and caster's belongings' coloration to that of the surrounding. It merely enhanced the caster's mundane hiding abilities and was not a form of ''[[invisibility]]''.

==Components==
''Camouflage'' only required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s.
