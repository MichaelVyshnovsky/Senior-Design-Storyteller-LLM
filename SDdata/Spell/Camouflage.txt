Camouflage was a transmutation spell that caused the caster to blend in with the colors of their surroundings.
As mentioned above, camouflage allowed the caster to blend in with the surrounding. This was done by changing the casters and casters belongings coloration to that of the surrounding. It merely enhanced the casters mundane hiding abilities and was not a form of invisibility.
Camouflage only required somatic and verbal components.
