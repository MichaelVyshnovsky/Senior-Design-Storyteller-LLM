        "mainbody": "Chromatic ray was a spell used by blackguards and evil clerics. \nThis spell was mainly used against good-aligned dragons and other dragonkind. When cast, the spell unleashed a bright, powerful multicolored ray at a target. If the targeted dragon failed to defend itself, it temporarily lost the ability to use its innate magical abilities. \nThis spell required only a verbal and somatic component."
