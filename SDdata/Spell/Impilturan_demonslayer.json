        "mainbody": "mpilturan demonslayers were heroes of Impiltur and hunters of the demonic forces that haunted it, especially during the late 15 century DR. Wielding dual weapons, most often two blades, Impilturan demonslayers fearlessly hunted the enemies of Impilturs people, be they demons or horrific plaguechanged monsters. To these bold adventurers, demons were little more than more powerful versions of the more common beasts most rangers hunt.\nIn order to slay the mighty abominations, which they hunted, Impilturan demonslayers dabbled in the ways of arcane magic, unlike most rangers. In addition to wielding the power of martial training, these warriors used a small number of potent spells in order to lay low the defenses of any demon they fought.\nThose beginning the path of a demonslayer quickly learned the ways of their foes and the arcane knowledge regarding them. This extra knowledge gave demonslayers a slight edge over the forces of the Abyss, making their attacks more potent. With further training, demonslayers could strip the defenses of a demon away, essentially rendering it mortal against the demonslayers blades. Once a demonslayer was provoked into a rage, they were even more deadly, particularly against their chosen foes.\nIn order to fight the demons that plagued Impiltur, demonslayers learned a few spells. Demonward was the earliest such spell learned and allowed demonslayers to adapt to their enemies attacks.  With further training, demonslayers could enchant their weapons to make them cut directly into the very souls of the foes they fought, dealing hot, searing damage to demons and their nearby allies. Not all abilities of the demonslayer were magical, however, and even the inexperienced could deal crippling damage through more mundane methods."
