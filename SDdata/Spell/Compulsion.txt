'''Compulsion''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that charmed a target and by will of the caster would move in a direction.

==Effect==
The caster attempted to charm targets that she could see or that could hear her. Targets that could not resist her spell became charmed and by the mere will of the caster they would have to move as much as they could in the caster's direction of choice. The caster could only pick horizontal directions from their location and the targets would not move into obviously dangerous areas like a great drop or boiling oil.

==Components==
Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were needed.
