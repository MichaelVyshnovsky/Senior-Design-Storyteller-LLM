        "mainbody": "Elsewhere chant was a spell used by clerics of Milil.\nThis spell was used to transport creatures or items over a great distance. The spell could transport up to two creatures, who had to be living. It could also transport a single creature and an item, or just two items. Transport via the spell was safe, similar to teleport without error. The desired destination could be any location the caster has visited or could see during casting, but it had to be located on the same plane the caster was currently on.\nThe spell had a weight limit. It could not transport more than  in weight. If the caster tried to transport items that weighed more than this limit, the spell merely transported whatever was in the limit and left the remainder behind. If one of the creatures weighed more than the limit, the spell merely failed.\nA side effect of it was that it would not transport parasites, rodents, or any creature hiding among the objects to be transported.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components.\nElsewhere chant was one of the spells found in Wythyndles Round Book, one of the few holy books of the Church of Milil."
