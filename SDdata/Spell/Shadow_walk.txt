'''''Shadow walk''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that helped people traveling long distances.

==Description==
The spell enabled one to travel to [[Shadow Fringe|the border]] between the [[Material Plane]] and the [[Plane of Shadow]], and then physically wander along this zone to the desired destination, taking advantage of an effect that caused one to move much faster here than on the material plane. A destination could also be on another plane. The caster could be accompanied by others, but they were under no compulsion to follow the caster around. They could strike out on their own, but the caster could also abandon them to become potentially lost.

Interestingly, the spell didn't make usage of teleportation

==Components==
''Shadow walk'' used verbal and somatic components only.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Telamont Tanthul|Shadow]] in {{Yearlink|-592}} and was originally known as '''''Shadow's walk'''''.

==Notable Users==
The [[sorcerer]]s of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] made frequent use of this spell.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|6}}

The [[Prince of Shade]] [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] transported himself and his allies across the [[Heartlands]] in order to help achieve [[the Return]].
