Shadow walk was an illusion spell that helped people traveling long distances.
The spell enabled one to travel to the border between the Material Plane and the Plane of Shadow, and then physically wander along this zone to the desired destination, taking advantage of an effect that caused one to move much faster here than on the material plane. A destination could also be on another plane. The caster could be accompanied by others, but they were under no compulsion to follow the caster around. They could strike out on their own, but the caster could also abandon them to become potentially lost.
Interestingly, the spell didnt make usage of teleportation
Shadow walk used verbal and somatic components only.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Shadow in  and was originally known as Shadows walk.
The sorcerers of the Jaezred Chaulssin made frequent use of this spell.
The Prince of Shade Melegaunt Tanthul transported himself and his allies across the Heartlands in order to help achieve the Return.
