        "mainbody": "Undead ward was a necromantic abjuration spell that created a barrier that turned undead like the cleric ability.\nUndead entering the area of effect were subjected to turning as if by a cleric two ranks lower than the caster of this spell. The turning was subject to the normal limitations of that power, i.e., limits on how many undead can be turned at once. Any undead that failed to be turned ignored undead ward for the duration of the spell. Likewise, any undead already within the barrier set up by this spell were not affected unless they exited and attempted to reenter. Note that the casting priest did not need to have the ability to turn undead.\nThe reverse of this spell was living ward.\nThe caster had to walk the perimeter of the area to be warded, speaking the words of the spell and using his or her holy symbol.\nThis spell was inscribed within the Kelemvorite relic the Testament of Vraer."
