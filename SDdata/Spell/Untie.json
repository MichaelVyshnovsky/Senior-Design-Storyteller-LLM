        "Effects": "This cantrip undid the effects of either ''tie'' or ''[[knot]]'' (but not both with one casting) or merely released a normal knot. ''Untie'' also canceled a ''[[tangle]]'' cantrip but left any underlying knots in place. Like its fellow cantrips, ''untie'' had no effect on [[magic item]]s.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast, but the gesture was tuned to the type of action desired. Typically, both hands were placed together and then pulled apart as if untying a knot or breaking a length of string. The verbal component was usually a popping noise."
