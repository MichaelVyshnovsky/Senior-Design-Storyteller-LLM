The '''''spell of seeking''''' was a common spell used in the southern [[wizard]] nation of [[Halruaa]].

==Effects==
The spell was imbued into objects, usually of some value.

Wizards of significant mastery of ''[[the Art]]'' learned to use the ''spell of seeking's'' path to transport themselves instantaneously in the form of similar red lightning along the trail towards the object.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, several items, such as a [[ruby]] earring and a masterfully-crafted red dress, were imbued with ''spells of seeking'' in order to track a young woman who possessed a powerful natural gift of magic as well as complete immunity to the arcane energies. The young woman [[Tzigone]] intuitively avoided such obvious traps.

In the spring of the same year, Tzigone stole a satchel with a valuable ''[[spellbook]]'' from a powerful [[necromancer]] [[Azgool Njammian]] in [[Khaerbaal]]. Her immunity to magic never activated the spell; however, the moment her [[jordaini]] ally [[Matteo (Halruaa)|Matteo]] dropped the bag onto the ground, the red tracking magic sizzled to life. Moments later, the ''spellbook's'' owner transported himself to deal with the thieves but was killed following a brief battle.
