The spell of seeking was a common spell used in the southern wizard nation of Halruaa.
The spell was imbued into objects, usually of some value.
Wizards of significant mastery of the Art learned to use the spell of seekings path to transport themselves instantaneously in the form of similar red lightning along the trail towards the object.
In the , several items, such as a ruby earring and a masterfully-crafted red dress, were imbued with spells of seeking in order to track a young woman who possessed a powerful natural gift of magic as well as complete immunity to the arcane energies. The young woman Tzigone intuitively avoided such obvious traps.
In the spring of the same year, Tzigone stole a satchel with a valuable spellbook from a powerful necromancer Azgool Njammian in Khaerbaal. Her immunity to magic never activated the spell however, the moment her jordaini ally Matteo dropped the bag onto the ground, the red tracking magic sizzled to life. Moments later, the spellbooks owner transported himself to deal with the thieves but was killed following a brief battle.
