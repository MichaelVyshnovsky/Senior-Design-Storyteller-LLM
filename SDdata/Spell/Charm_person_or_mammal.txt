Charm person or mammal, also known as charm person or animal, was an enchantment spell that could favorably alter the attitude toward the caster of one humanoid person or mammalian creature.
This spell charmed any small to mid-sized humanoid or mammal that was the target of the spell. After casting, the targeted individual saw the caster as a trusted ally and long-time friend. The spell did not allow the caster to control the targeted creature. The spell also did not alter the individuals alignment or personality. The spell could be removed with a dispel magic spell.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
