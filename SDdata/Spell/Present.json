        "mainbody": "Present was a legerdemain cantrip that apprentice wizards could learn. It fetched one or more small objects from very close by and placed them in the casters hand.\nThis cantrip operated on objects within  of the caster, and the exact location and nature of the objects had to be known by the caster. That is, one could not summon just any hidden weapon a person might have, but could fetch a dagger they had seen placed in a boot. The spell had limited strength and, for example, was exhausted after teleporting one dagger or one tankard to the casters hand, but could fetch up to a dozen coins all at once or one at a time in quick succession. If the target object was in the possession of another person and out of sight, they had a chance to resist this spell.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster spoke a magic word and dramatically raised or extended a hand to receive the object."
