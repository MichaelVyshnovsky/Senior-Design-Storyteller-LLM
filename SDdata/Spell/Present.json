        "Effects": "This cantrip operated on objects within {{SI|2|ft|c|long=yes}} of the caster, and the exact location and nature of the objects had to be known by the caster. That is, one could not summon just any hidden weapon a person might have, but could fetch a [[dagger]] they had seen placed in a boot. The spell had limited strength and, for example, was exhausted after teleporting one dagger or one tankard to the caster's hand, but could fetch up to a dozen coins all at once or one at a time in quick succession. If the target object was in the possession of another person and out of sight, they had a chance to resist this spell.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster spoke a magic word and dramatically raised or extended a hand to receive the object."
