        "Effects": "This spell was similar to ''[[darkness]]'' except for the smaller radius of effect (15 ft/4.6 m as opposed to 20 ft/6.1 m) and the ability to cast it at a range. The range of this spell increased with the experience of the caster. The darkness was total, preventing sight for even those creatures that could normally see in the dark, and immobile, because it affected an area rather than an object.\n\nThe [[illusionist]] version of this spell had a shorter, more unpredictable duration than the wizard version.\n\n''Darkness, 15' radius'' countered and was countered by ''[[light]]'' and ''[[continual light]]''.\n\n[[Sinhala]] stones were known to prevent magical darkness.",
        "History": "The spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Fahren]] in {{Yearlink|-1479}}."
