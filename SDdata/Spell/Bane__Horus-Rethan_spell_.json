        "mainbody": "'''''Bane''''' was a powerful [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to [[priest]]s of [[Horus-Re]]. It bestowed a permanent [[curse]] on a creature that was likely to make their life miserable and short. There were very few ways to remove ''bane'', but '''''reverse bane''''' was one of them.",
        "Effects": "After casting the spell, the caster had ten minutes in which to touch the intended victim or the spell was wasted. If the target managed to resist the spell, they were still afflicted with a terrible curse that could only be removed by ''reverse bane'' or a ''[[wish]]''. A [[deity]] of any sort could also remove it using ''[[remove curse]]'', but mortals only had the other two options. If the victim failed to resist the spell, their attempts at attack or defense became woefully inept, they could not resist any form of attack ([[magic]], [[poison]], breath weapon, ''etc.''), and always suffered the worst possible injury from any successful attack.\n\n''Reverse bane'' was equally powerful, being able to remove ''bane'', ''[[major curse]]'', ''[[bestow curse]]'', and other afflictions of that type. However, it only worked on relatively long-term curses, not instantaneous ones like a cursed [[scroll]] that explodes when read.",
        "Components": "This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast."
