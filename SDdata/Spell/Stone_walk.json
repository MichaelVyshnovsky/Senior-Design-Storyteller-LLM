        "mainbody": "'''''Stone walk''''' was a [[divine]] [[transmutation]] spell unique to [[cleric]]s of [[Bane]]. It linked one stone area with another to permit multiple teleportations.",
        "Effect": "The Banite priest first needed to prepare the two areas to be linked. These must be stone surfaces some 5 feet by 5 feet (1.5 meters by 1.5 meters) in area and the work took one hour. If the stones were not damaged, they could be reused for future castings of ''stone walk''.\n\nOn casting the spell itself, the stones were attuned to a chosen command word. Thereafter, anyone who stood on one of the stones and uttered the command word was instantly and reliably teleported to the other.\n\nThe stones functioned a very limited number of times: initially only twice, but more often for more experienced clerics. They also had a weight limit of {{SI|550|lb|k|long=yes}}, or more for experienced clerics. Creatures that went over this were not transported, yet still consumed one use of the spell.\n\nThe ''[[gate seal]]'' spell negated the magic of the ''stone walk'' spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, the spell required expensive [[material component]]s. A paste composed of [[ruby|rubies]] and [[amber]] costing 2500 [[gp]] was needed to prepare each end of the link. Furthermore, a [[diamond]] also valued at 2500 [[gp]] was needed just to cast the spell. However, thereafter, activating a linked stone the required no additional cost.",
        "History": "''Stone walk'' was one of a number of unique spells provided by either Bane or [[Xvim]] to their clergy, and it was granted by Bane after his revival in [[1372 DR]].",
        "Uses": "Agents of the [[Zhentarim]] regularly used ''stone walk'' to travel swiftly between [[Zhent]]-controlled fortresses."
