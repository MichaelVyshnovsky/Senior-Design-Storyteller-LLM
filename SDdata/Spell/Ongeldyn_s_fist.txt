}}'''''Ongeldyn's fist''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the school of [[evocation]]. This spell was created by the wizard [[Ongeldyn]].

==Effects==
This spell created a large shadowy fist roughly the size of a man's torso. The caster could use the fist to strike a single visible target with powerful blows.

There was no way to block the fist but a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell would destroy it. Once the target was selected the fist would continue to attack for several minutes until either the spell ended or the target was slain, at which point the fist dissipated. The fist was unable to attack a target that traveled to a different plane to escape, but it was well suited for striking targets on the same plane, sticking with its target even if they used spells such as ''[[blink]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', or ''[[teleport]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]] a small fist carved of [[onyx]] to cast.
