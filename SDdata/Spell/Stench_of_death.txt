Stench of death was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, this spell filled an area with an overpowering revolting smell of decay and death. Creatures within 50 feet (15 meters) of the wu jen experienced severe disorientation as a result of the smell. Wind could not clear the area of the smell, but spells such as dispel magic would. After a creature left the affected area or the spell expired, they required a period of time to recover their senses.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a rotting piece of flesh or organ.
