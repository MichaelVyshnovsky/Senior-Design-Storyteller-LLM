The spell was intended to allow the caster to harm a foe with the same deathly cold hands as a lich.\nChill touch could be cast by sorcerers, wizards, and clerics who commanded the cold domain In the time of Netheril, it could be cast by arcanists of the Inventive and Variation specializations.\nThe casters hand glowed blue and a touch from it channeled negative energy into a victim, disrupting their life force. It could also possibly weaken the targets muscles, draining their strength, though this effect could be resisted. \nThe spell had a special effect on undead creatures. Undead touched suffered no damage or strength loss, but they could flee in terror for a short time if the spell overcame their will.\nThe sundering version of the spell created a ghostly skeleton hand around a creature. The hand could by will of the caster attack the creature with necrotic energy and shortly hindering its ability to regain health as it clung on to it. A undead creature struck by the hand would have disadvantage on its attacks against the caster.\nSome versions of the spell called for the powdered bone of a lich.\nThe Netherese arcanist Veridon, ruler of Lathery, was given the credit for the creation of this spell. He introduced it in 3396 NY (−463 DR) under the name Veridons chiller. It later became known simply as chill touch.\nChill touch was a rare spell in Faerûn in the 1360s DR."
