        "mainbody": "Great thump was a common spell used by geisha. The spell was sometimes used by wu jen and was extremely rare outside Kara-Tur.\nSimilar to thump, the spell was used by the caster to reprimand an aggressive creature. When cast, an ornamental fan would thump a creature, and the creature lost all interest in attacking the caster. If the creature was attacked, the spell would expire and the creature became aggressive once more.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic and material components."
