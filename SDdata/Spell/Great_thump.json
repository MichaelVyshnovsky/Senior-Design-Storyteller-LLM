        "Effects": "Similar to ''[[thump]]'', the spell was used by the caster to reprimand an aggressive creature. When cast, an ornamental fan would thump a creature, and the creature lost all interest in attacking the caster. If the creature was attacked, the spell would expire and the creature became aggressive once more.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[somatic component|somatic]] and [[material component]]s."
