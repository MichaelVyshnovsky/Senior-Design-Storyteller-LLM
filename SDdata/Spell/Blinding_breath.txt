Blinding breath was a spell used by dragons that granted their breath the power to blind those who were affected by it.
The spell only worked on breath weapons based on fire or lightning. When cast, it suffused the breath weapon of the caster with bright light. Those who failed to avert the worst of its force became permanently blinded.
Besides its somatic component, blinding breath required a breath weapon to be used alongside the casting.
