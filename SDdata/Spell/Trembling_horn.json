        "mainbody": "'''''Trembling horn''''' was an [[evocation]]/[[illusion]] that allowed the caster to place an invisible, [[magic]]al tracer upon a person or creature. It was developed by [[Thyriellentha Snome]] for use by the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] of [[Waterdeep]] for use in apprehending certain individuals.\n\nThe spell was well-known among the Waterdhavian citizenry. When its effects were seen or heard, citizens often took matters into their own hands and assisted the Watch in apprehending their quarry.",
        "Effects": "When this spell was cast, a spellcaster was required to blow special horn that was associated with the Waterdhavian City Watch in the direction of affected individual while they were within sight.\n\nWhenever the target of the spell moved within 30' (9.1 m) of another horn-carrying member of the Watch a glowing, actively sounding horn appeared over the head of the affected individual. The arcane image appeared brighter and blew louder as any City Watchmen moved closer to the affected individual. The effects faded after a matter seconds.\n\nIf an individual affected by ''trembling horn'' went for one hour without encountering any horn-carrying members of the Watch, the spell fizzled without effect.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in addition to the City Watch horn."
