Float was a divine alteration spell that allowed a cleric to levitate a large object through the air.
When casting this spell, a cleric bestowed flight upon any object weighing up to 500 lbs (226.8 kg). By maintaining concentration upon the object they could maneuver it through the air at a relatively slow speed. Its duration lasted for a matter of minutes, depending on the skill and experience of the caster.
In addition to verbal and somatic components this spell required a small bit of duck down.
