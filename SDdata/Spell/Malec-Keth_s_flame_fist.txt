'''''Malec-Keth's flame fist''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that was used by [[wizard]]s. This spell was developed by [[Malec-Keth]].

==Effects==
Upon its completion, this spell caused one of the caster's hands to burst into flame. The caster decided which hand would be wreathed in flame. The flames did not harm the caster and cast as much light as a [[torch]]. If the caster was able to touch a creature there was a high chance the flames would transfer from the caster's hand to completely envelop the creature in agonizing fire. The caster could also choose to transfer the flame to any touched object which would react accordingly to the fire.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.
