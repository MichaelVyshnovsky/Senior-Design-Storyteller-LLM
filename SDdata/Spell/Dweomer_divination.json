        "mainbody": "'''''Dweomer divination''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] that revealed information about a touched item to the spell's caster over a short period of time. This knowledge was wide-ranging in scope and depth, covering a wealth of information.",
        "Effects": {
            "Errant Dweomers": "This spell not only revealed powers that were imbued into an item, either during its creation or possible subsequent enchantment, but also residual dweomers caused by powerful spells. ''Dweomer divination'' revealed general information about these magics, but not their exact specifications."
        },
        "Casting": "This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast, along with near-continuous contact between the caster and item. The spell ended prematurely if the caster failed to touch the item for over a minute, or if it held no dweomers.",
        "History": "This was an extremely rare spell used by [[priest]]s on [[Toril]]."
