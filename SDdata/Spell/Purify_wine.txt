Purify wine was a divine magic spell used by Lliiran priests who committed themselves to wine production.
When the spell was cast, it clarified the target container of up to three gallons of wine, removing all sediment and impurities. The spells effects were permanent and the target had to be within one yard of the caster. Purify wine was a reversible spell and could be cast to cloud and create impurities within targeted container of wine. The volume that could be clarified increased with the cleric magical proficiencies.
Purify wine required verbal, somatic, and material components to be cast. The spells material component was a clear glass ball. The reverse spells material component was a smoky-colored glass ball.
In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, purify wine and age wine spells were used by the hin winemakers and priests of Lliira Jolly Greenleaf and Brandywine Furfoot of Ravens Bluff. Jolly committed his life to the art of winemaking and ran As the Vine Twines winery in the Bluff. Cleric Greenleaf learned of the Lliiran divine magic that helped with the production of wine from France, a traveling cleric of Lliira, soon after the halfling found himself in Ravens Bluff.
