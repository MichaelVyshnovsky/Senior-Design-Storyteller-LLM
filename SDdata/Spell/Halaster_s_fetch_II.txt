'''''Halaster's fetch II''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that functioned exactly as ''[[summon monster II]]'', except that the conjured creatures did not disappear when its duration was over. Rather, they regained their free will and continued their existence outside the control of the caster.

This spell was invented and developed by the "Mad Mage" of the [[Undermountain]], [[Halaster Blackcloak]].
