'''''See invisibility''''', or '''''detect invisibility''''', was a [[divination]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to see invisible or [[Ethereal plane|ethereal]] creatures and objects.

==Effects==
When cast, the spellcaster's eyes could see invisible and ethereal things as translucent shapes for a distance as far as he or she could normally see. It was easy to determine which things were visible as opposed to invisible while under the effects of [[Invisibility|the spell]].

The spell did not provide any information about whether the invisibility was the result of a spell or of some supernatural quality. It did not permit the caster to see through other opaque objects. Someone or something hidden in a natural manner was not revealed by this spell.

The ability provided lasted at least a half hour and longer if cast by a more powerful spellcaster. The effect could also be made permanent.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, a pinch of talc, and a tiny sprinkling of powdered [[silver]].

==History==
This spell was originally developed by [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Trebbe]] in {{Yearlink|-2241}} under the name '''''Trebbe's scry invisibility'''''.<ref>

==Notable Users==
Some creatures had an innate ability similar to ''see invisibility'', such as [[helmed horror]]s, [[jade spider]]s, and [[marid]]s.
