Shadowgloom was an illusion spell that could be employed in two different ways. 
The two usages were called gloomcloud and quickshadow. The former created a cloud that could envelop an object or creature for concealment purposes. It protected creatures inside from the effects of sunlight and creatures whose vision wasnt fully functional in daylight. The cloud also made it difficult to make attacks inside or into the cloud.
The latter created a humanoid shadow that moved in one direction. What humanoid the shadow depicted was the casters choice, thus it could be used for coded messaging purposes, in which the depicted humanoids race determined the messages code.
Shadowgloom used only verbal components.
