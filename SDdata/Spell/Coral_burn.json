        "mainbody": "'''''Coral burn''''' was a [[spell]] that was a variation of the ''[[heat metal]]'' spell.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell began to heat up any exposed coral within {{SI|40|yd|long=yes}} from the caster. Any living coral was subsequently killed and the spell injured [[Dukar]] within the area of effect.\n\nImmediately after the spell was cast, the coral became comfortably warm. However, it gradually increased in temperature, eventually becoming so hot it inflicted severe burns.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]]."
