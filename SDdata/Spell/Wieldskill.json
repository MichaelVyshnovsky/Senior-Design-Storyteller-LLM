        "mainbody": "Wieldskill was a divination spell used by clerics. This spell originated from Gond the Wonderbringer.\nWhen cast, this spell granted the caster a hint of divine guidance. The effect typically manifested by either temporarily enhancing the casters proficiency with a known skill, or by granting them rudimentary knowledge of an unknown skill. This also applied to the use of weapons.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
