'''''Flame blade''''' was an [[evocation]] spell that created a sword-like beam of fire that extended from the caster's hand and performed similar to a [[scimitar]].

==Effects==
[[File:Baldur's Gate EE - Flame Sword.png|thumb|''A halfling with the flame blade.'']]
The blade inflicted fire damage, could ignite items, and gave off light. Strangely enough, this flaming blade was not a magical weapon but unsurprisingly, it wouldn't work underwater.

==Components==
All versions required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, but the oldest version and the post-[[Second Sundering]] version required the caster to have a leaf of [[sumac]].
