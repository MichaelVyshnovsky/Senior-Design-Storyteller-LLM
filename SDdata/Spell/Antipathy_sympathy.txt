Antipathy/sympathy was an enchantment spell that could attract or repel creatures of a certain type to an object, area, or creature.
The caster specified either a creature no larger than an adult dragon or a giant, an object no larger than a cube 15 ft (4.6 m) on a side, or an area no larger than a cube 200 ft (61 m) on a side, and one kind of intelligent creature. The spell created an aura on the target that lasted for 10 days and affected all creatures of that type with one of these effects
 Antipathy  Affected creatures could not move closer than 60 ft (18.3 m) from the target without becoming terrified of it and feeling an intense urge to move as far as possible from it.
 Sympathy  Affected creatures that saw the target or moved within 60 ft (18.3 m) of it would feel strongly compelled to move towards it.
In either case, if a creature was able to resist the effect, it immediately realized that it was being magically affected and became immune to it.
The spell required verbal, somatic and material components. The materials required depended on the effect desired for antipathy, a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for sympathy, a drop of honey.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Kutson in  and was originally known as Kutsons antipathy/sympathy.
