        "Effects": "This spell created a murky object of force shaped like a blade measuring up to {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} in length. The ''fellblade'' needed to remain in the caster's grasp or it would instantly fade to nothing. In addition to causing normal harm, a strike from a ''fellblade'' could drain enough vitality from the target to fully heal the caster. Each of these draining attacks shortened the length of the spell by ten minutes. A strike could also cause a similar effect to the ''[[bestow curse]]'' spell.\n\nThe vile nature of the ''fellblade'' risked tainting a caster who was pure of heart.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a drop of the caster's blood, a piece of [[cold iron|cold-wrought iron]], and a drop of ''[[holy water|unholy water]]'' to cast."
