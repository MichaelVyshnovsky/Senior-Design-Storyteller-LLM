'''''Erase''''' was [[transmutation]] spell that caused mundane and magical writing to disappear.

==Effect==
Casting this spell wiped a [[scroll]] or two pages of [[paper]], [[parchment]], or the like clean of all writing, whether mundane or magical. This could remove ''[[arcane mark]]s'', ''[[explosive runes]]'', ''[[glyph of warding|glyphs of warding]]'', and ''[[sepia snake sigil]]s'', but not ''[[illusory script]]'' or ''[[symbol]]'' spells. Mundane writing was erased automatically if nearby (within 30 feet (9.1 meters)) and not in someone's hand, or with a 90% success rate otherwise. Magical writing had to be touched by the caster, and their casting skill determined whether the erasure was successful or not. If an attempt failed to erase ''explosive runes'', a ''glyph of warding'', or a ''sepia snake sigil'', they were activated instead.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Raliteff]] in the {{YearlinkName|-675}} and was originally known as '''''Raliteff's strike'''''.

==Components==
Casting some versions of this spell required a sample of [[rubber plant]] sap as a [[material component]].

===Inscription===
According to the ''[[Book of the Silver Talon]]'', the ingredients for the [[ink]] used to inscribe ''erase'' into [[spellbook]]s were one ounce of [[giant squid]] sepia, an ounce of acid, three dozen crushed caraway seeds, one [[chrysolite]], and one black [[pearl]]. The gems would be dissolved in the acid over the period of two days. After this, the acid was heated in an [[elven]]-made [[bronze]] tureen with the seeds being added after it was brought to a boil. This would neutralize the acid allowing the mixture to be cooled and mixed with the sepia.
