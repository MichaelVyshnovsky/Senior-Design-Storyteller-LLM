        "mainbody": "It was developed by the Srinshee. Unknown to all but three of her students, Elminster Aumar, Mythanthar and Aravae Irithyl, there was a stronger version, which could only be wielded by those who had trascended the power of conventional magecraft. This version of the spell, recorded only in her own secret spellbooks, was capable of blocking all conventional spells from its inner barrier, and was not limited to countering or manipulating spells, being also capable of creating transient dead magic or wild magic bubbles, as well as aiding other spells, bolstering their power. This spell was considered a precursor to globe of invulnerability, but the existence of its superior version was seen as up for debate."
