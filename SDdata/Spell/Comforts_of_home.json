        "mainbody": "Comforts of home was a divine magic spell granted to priests of Cyrrollalee, the Hearthkeeper. It granted the recipient the illusion of having good food, a soft bed, a bath, and a fresh change of clothes.\nThe caster had to touch a willing recipient in order to cast this spell. The effects lasted for eight hours. When cast, the targets mind was convinced that hard ground was a soft bed and paltry food was warm, tasty, and filling. Experiencing the comforts of home eased the stress of difficult travel conditions and allowed the recipient to get a full night of gentle bed rest, awakening with renewed vigor, natural healing, the feeling of having bathed and donned fresh clothing, and being mentally prepared to study or pray for spells.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components as well as the use of the priests holy symbol."
