        "mainbody": "Deep slumber was an improved version of sleep that affected more creatures and/or tougher creatures. \nTypically an arcane spell, and the elven goddess Sehanine Moonbow.\nThis spell could only be cast at close range (unlike sleep, which had a medium range) but it could affect more creatures caught in the 10-foot (3-meter) radius burst and potentially tougher creatures as well. Like sleep, the smallest and weakest creatures succumbed first and then the larger/tougher creatures if there was enough magical energy left in the spell. For creatures of equivalent size/toughness, the ones closest to the center of the effect were enchanted first. If any creature resisted this spell, they were unaffected. Those that did not resist fell asleep for a number of minutes equal to the experience level of the caster.\nThis spell had no effect on undead, constructs, or creatures already unconscious.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a few rose petals, a live cricket, or a pinch of fine-grained sand."
