        "mainbody": "'''''Deep slumber''''' was an improved version of ''[[sleep]]'' that affected more creatures and/or tougher creatures.",
        "Users": "Typically an [[Arcane magic|arcane spell]], and the [[elven]] goddess [[Sehanine Moonbow]].",
        "Effects": "This spell could only be cast at close range (unlike ''sleep'', which had a medium range) but it could affect more creatures caught in the 10-foot (3-meter) radius burst and potentially tougher creatures as well. Like ''sleep'', the smallest and weakest creatures succumbed first and then the larger/tougher creatures if there was enough magical energy left in the spell. For creatures of equivalent size/toughness, the ones closest to the center of the effect were enchanted first. If any creature resisted this spell, they were unaffected. Those that did not resist fell asleep for a number of minutes equal to the experience level of the caster.\n\nThis spell had no effect on [[undead]], [[construct]]s, or creatures already unconscious.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a few [[rose]] petals, a live [[cricket]], or a pinch of fine-grained [[sand]]."
