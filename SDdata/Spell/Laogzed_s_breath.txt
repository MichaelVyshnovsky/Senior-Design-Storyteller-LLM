Laogzeds breath was a spell that created a cone of noxious vapor that emanated forth from the caster. It was named after Laogzed, the toad-lizard god of the troglodytes.
The nauseating fumes created by this spell were quite similar to those conjured by the spell stinking cloud, except that they lasted for one minute without the concentration of the caster.
