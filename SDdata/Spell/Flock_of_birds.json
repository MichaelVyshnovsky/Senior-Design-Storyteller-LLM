        "mainbody": "Flock of birds was a divine conjuration spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Thoth called Scriveners.\nThis spell would summon a large flock of birds to a  sphere where they would normally be found. The birds were so densely packed that vision was limited to  and spellcasting within the sphere was impossible.\nThe scrivener could direct the birds to fanatically attack a single target within the sphere. The birds were not able to harm creatures immune to normal weapons. Nothing would drive the birds away before the spell ended, but they could be killed by normal methods.\nDruids and nature priests viewed this spell as an affront to nature and would make the caster atone for its use if witnessed by the druid.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a handful of feathers and the priests holy symbol to cast."
