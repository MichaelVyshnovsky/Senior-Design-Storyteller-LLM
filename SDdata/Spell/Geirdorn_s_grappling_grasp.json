        "mainbody": "Geirdorns grappling grasp was an evocation spell used by wizards. This spell was developed by Geirdorn.\nThis spell called into being a small hand of force that the caster could use to manipulate objects. The hand was invisible to all but the caster. The hand was twice the size of the casters left hand. Controlling the hand required the casters full concentration, so beginning a new spell or performing other dextrous acts left the hand hanging in the air until the caster was finished, at which point they could resume control of the hand.\nThe hand was unable to touch living materials, but could interact with everything else with the same strength as the caster but lacked any fine motor skills. It moved as fast as the caster could normally move.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a glove or finger bone to cast."
