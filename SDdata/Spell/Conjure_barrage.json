        "mainbody": "Conjure barrage was a conjuration spell used by rangers that could turn a single mundane missile into a swarm of them.\nWhen the caster shot or threw a single non-magical missile into the air, the spell created a  wide cone of identical missiles in front of the caster, potentially striking many targets caught in the area.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component in the form of a missile weapon, whether it be thrown like a throwing axe or shot like a crossbow."
