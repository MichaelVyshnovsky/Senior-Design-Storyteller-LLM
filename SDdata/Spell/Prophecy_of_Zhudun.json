        "mainbody": "Prophecy of Zhudun was an invocation used by warlocks of the late 15 century DR, particularly those with the star pact.\nWith this invocation, the warlock whispered fragments of prophecy seen in the blank face of the dead star Zhudun, and a creature of their choosing suffered a nightmarish vision. Distracted, they became dazed and unable to see foes if they lacked the willpower to resist it."
