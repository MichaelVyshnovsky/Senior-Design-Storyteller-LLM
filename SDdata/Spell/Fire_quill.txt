'''''Fire quill''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] used to transform ordinary feathers into magical tools.

==Effects==
When cast upon a normal feather this spell allowed it to write letters in [[illusion|illusory]] flame. Any dry medium, including air, could be written upon. The number of letters, symbols or characters that could be written was determined by the power of the spellcaster. Magical symbols or runes could not be formed using the quill. The light created by these flaming letters was bright enough to allow others to read in complete darkness within 7 feet. Since they were illusions the letters could not cause other objects to ignite. Only the caster of the spell could use the quill to form the letters.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a feather to cast.
