The Archbarony of Blackmoor, or simply Blackmoor, was an unruly barony on the world of Oerth.
Blackmoor was a wild land and a collection of sporadic tribes, each with their own leader, with the city of Dantredun being the capital and the biggest settlement of the barony. The land was permeated with strange and unidentifiable magic. Some believed that a strange substance called the black ice, found to the north of Blackmoor, was responsible for the arcane radiation.
The Blackmoor Bay was a part of the Oerthian Icy Sea divided into two bays by a stretch of land. The frigid waters of the bay were the home of several aquatic species, while barbarian tribes roamed its shores.
Little was known of the government structure of the Archbarony of Blackmoor. The region was ruled by His Luminous Preponderancy, Archbaron of Blackmoor and the barony maintained no diplomatic relationships with other regions of Oerth.
Historically, Blackmoor faced little danger from invading armies as most invaders did not bother with the region. However, kobolds from the Burneal Forest posed some minor threat to the inhabitants of the barony. In the ancient days, the Northern Adepts of Old Blackmoor constructed mysterious mounds and standing stones that could be found throughout the land. These strange structures were believed, according to legends, to constrain magics of the black ice in the north.
Scaldulin was a venerated hero from the region of Blackmoor who was known to the sages of the word of Toril. The hero famously wielded the enchanted weapon called the Hoarfrost Blade, which he pulled from the heart of a glacier. Armed with the powerful weapons, Scaldulin stood against a demon horde in the Battle of the Thousand Dead. Later, he used the sword to dismember a powerful lich, Scaroth the Warped of Blackmoor.
Eventually, Scaldulin was transformed into a death knight, killing a solar named Arazium in the process. Subsequently, the Hoarfrost Blade was broken and was lost to the planes. The shards resurfaced on Toril in 1372 DR. One piece was in the possession of a death slaad named Loru who sought to start a slaad plague, and another was carried by a half-celestial escaped criminal named Alaffinelâ€Ž.
