        "mainbody": "'''''Tirumael's energy spheres''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s. This spell was created by [[Tirumael]].",
        "Effects": "This spell created five spheres of energy that orbited the caster's head at a distance of one foot. These spheres provided the same amount of light as a ''[[dancing lights]]'' spell. Each sphere was represented by one of the five types of energyâ€”acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic.\n\nThe spheres could be used offensively to strike targets within range. Conversely, the spheres could be used defensive if attacked by a corresponding energy type by absorbing some of the harmful energy.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required five glass marbles to cast."
