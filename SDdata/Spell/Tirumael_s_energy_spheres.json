        "mainbody": "Tirumaels energy spheres was an evocation spell used by wizards and sorcerers. This spell was created by Tirumael.\nThis spell created five spheres of energy that orbited the casters head at a distance of one foot. These spheres provided the same amount of light as a dancing lights spell. Each sphere was represented by one of the five types of energyâ€”acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic.\nThe spheres could be used offensively to strike targets within range. Conversely, the spheres could be used defensive if attacked by a corresponding energy type by absorbing some of the harmful energy.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required five glass marbles to cast."
