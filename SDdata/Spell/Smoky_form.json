        "mainbody": "Smoky form was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, this spell transformed a wu jen into a mass of thick smoke. The wu jens clothing and equipment were also transformed. The spell also affected any creature in physical contact with the wu jen at casting. The resulting cloud of smoke had the same shape and appearance as the individual. For the duration of the spell, an individual was immune to physical attacks. Further spells couldnt be cast while the wu jen was in smoke form. \nWhile the actual mass of the individual was not altered, their weight became the same as smoke. So an individual in smoky form couldnt squeeze through cracks in a wall, but could drift down from cliff. While in smoky form, the individual was vulnerable to wind, which caused them to move in directions they could not control. Spells such as gust of wind or wind breath inflicted damage to an individual in smoky form, and the divine wind spell killed the individual.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, some burning incense."
