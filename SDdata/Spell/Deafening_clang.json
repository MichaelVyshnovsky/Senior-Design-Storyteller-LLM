        "mainbody": "Deafening clang was a spell used by clerics and paladins of Gaerdal Ironhand.\nThis spell allowed the caster to enchant a metal weapon with a sonic power. When the weapon hit a solid surface, it emitted an incredibly loud clang. Any creature who heard this clang was rendered temporarily deaf. The caster was immune to the effects of the spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a divine focus. The clerical spell required material components, the holy symbol of Gaerdal Ironhand and a small, round gong made from metal."
