Sustain was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur.
A shugenja was able to cast this spell on themselves or another creature. Until the spell expired, the individual was able to go without food or water. They did not feel hunger or thirst. After the spell expired, there was no ill effects. If this spell was cast on a starving creature, they suddenly felt as if they had been eating a regular meal every six hours.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a rice cake and a flask of warm sake.
