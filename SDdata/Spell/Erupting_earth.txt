Erupting earth was a transmutation spell that caused an area on the ground to erupt like a fountain.
The spell caused a square portion of the ground to erupt in a fountain of earth and stone that occupied a cube  on a side, hitting all creatures within that volume that could not evade the effect in time. The violence of the spell increased with the casters power. Although the fountain only lasted for a moment, it covered the area in debris that required a long time to clear.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was a piece of obsidian.
