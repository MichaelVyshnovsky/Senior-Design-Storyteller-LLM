Spawn of Tiamat was a divine alteration spell granted by Tiamat that could bestow an additional head and neck to a chromatic dragon.
Upon casting the spell, the targeted chromatic dragon grew an additional head and neck identical in appearance to the original. This extra head had no intelligence and couldnt be used to cast further spells, but it was completely under control of its dragon host, who could use it to bite or employ their breath weapon. The head disappeared whenever the spell duration was up, it took a certain amount of damage, or the host dragon died.
This spell required the use of the casting priests holy symbol, as well as a pair of hydra scales.
It was reputed that the Untheric cult of Tiamat used a more powerful variant on this spell, Lernaean spawn of Tiamat, which granted the additional head the regenerative properties of the Lernaean hydra.
Besides her conventional human clergy, some dragons that worshiped Tiamat were supposedly able to cast this spell.
