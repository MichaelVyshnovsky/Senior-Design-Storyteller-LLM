        "Effect": "This spell functioned very similarly to the less powerful ''[[Glyph of Warding|glyph of warding]]''. However, this more potent glyph caused far more damage, and the ''greater glyph'' could store a spell that was as powerful as ''[[chain lightning]]'' or lesser.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[somatic]], [[verbal]] and [[material component]]s. The latter component was [[diamond]] dust, which cost at least 400 [[gp]]."
