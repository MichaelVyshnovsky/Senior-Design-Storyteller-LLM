        "mainbody": "Greater glyph of warding was an abjuration spell that created a glyph that would cause damage to those who triggered it.\nThis spell functioned very similarly to the less powerful glyph of warding. However, this more potent glyph caused far more damage, and the greater glyph could store a spell that was as powerful as chain lightning or lesser.\nThe spell required somatic, verbal and material components. The latter component was diamond dust, which cost at least 400 gp."
