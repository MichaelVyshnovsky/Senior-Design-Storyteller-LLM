        "mainbody": "Greater sanctuary was a spell that was a stronger version of sanctuary.\nWhen cast, this spell protected the caster from detection. The spell achieved this by transforming the caster into an ethereal state. If the caster was attacked or they attacked an opponent, the etherealness vanished and the caster was visible once more.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
