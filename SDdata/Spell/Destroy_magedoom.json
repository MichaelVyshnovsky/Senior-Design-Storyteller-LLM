        "mainbody": "'''''Destroy magedoom''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Azuth]], enabling them to combat [[magedoom]]s. Azuth only granted this spell to high-ranking priests who served him well.",
        "Effects": "This spell bypassed a magedoom's immunity to magic, instantly destroying the creature if it was unable to resist the spell. The magedoom still suffered a great deal of harm when resisting the spell which may even kill it anyway. This spell had no effect if cast upon other creatures.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a [[magic item]] to cast. The magic item was consumed during the casting."
