        "mainbody": "Acorn barrage was a divine magic spell granted to priests of Rillifane Rallathil, the Great Oak. It allowed the caster to pelt one or more targets with acorns.\nCasting this spell required a source of acorns, either in the casters hand, on the ground, or from an oak tree within . The acorns became projectiles as if the caster had hurled them individually using a sling, with a maximum range of . The missiles could be aimed at any targets in any combination within this range as long as the caster could see the targets. A novice could hurl two acorns, but more experienced priests could throw increasing numbers of missiles. A single successful attack did a modicum of damage and the projectiles themselves were not magical.\nThe casters dexterity with a sling was irrelevant unless the acorns were held in the hand. This spell was useless if cast under water.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components as well as the priests holy symbol and a source of acorns."
