        "mainbody": "'''''Garments of elvenkind''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[elf|elven]] [[cleric]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to enchant a pair of [[boots]], a [[cloak]], and a pair of [[bracers]]. Once enchanted, the cloak acted as a ''[[cloak of elvenkind]]'', the boots as ''[[boots of elvenkind]]'', and the bracers as ''[[bracers of archery]]''. The enchanted clothing could be used by any creature but they must use all three items, otherwise the spell failed. The spell was vulnerable to ''[[dispel magic]]''. Once the spell expired, the items returned to their normal state.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required several [[material component]]s. Along with the caster's [[holy symbol]], the spell required three drops from a ''[[potion of invisibility]]'', three small items that were once enchanted with a ''[[silence]]'' dweomer, and three enchanted [[arrow]]s. Every material component except the holy symbol was consumed by the spell."
