        "mainbody": "Garments of elvenkind was a spell used by elven clerics.\nThis spell allowed the caster to enchant a pair of boots, a cloak, and a pair of bracers. Once enchanted, the cloak acted as a cloak of elvenkind, the boots as boots of elvenkind, and the bracers as bracers of archery. The enchanted clothing could be used by any creature but they must use all three items, otherwise the spell failed. The spell was vulnerable to dispel magic. Once the spell expired, the items returned to their normal state.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required several material components. Along with the casters holy symbol, the spell required three drops from a potion of invisibility, three small items that were once enchanted with a silence dweomer, and three enchanted arrows. Every material component except the holy symbol was consumed by the spell."
