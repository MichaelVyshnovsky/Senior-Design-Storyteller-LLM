        "mainbody": "'''''Eilistraee's prayer missiles''''' was a variation of the ''[[magic missile]]'' [[evocation]] [[spell]] that summoned forth missiles of magical energy for the destruction of [[ju-ju zombie]]s by the [[Church of Eilistraee|clergy of Eilistraee]].",
        "Effects": "When the spell was cast, it created a barrage of bright silvery ''magic missiles'' that flew towards their targets and struck them without error, targeting one or more creatures within a {{SIAdj|10|ft|long=yes}} cube. The spell's targets could only be creatures. These missiles resembled the magical bolts created by the goddess [[Eilistraee]]'s [[avatar]]. The number of summoned missiles increased with the spellcaster's level as well as the spell's distance, starting at {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. ''Eilistraee's prayer missiles'' functioned and were affected by the same magics as normal ''magic missiles''. The spell's damage differed depending on the target's alignment and, most notably, the spell could deal normal damage to [[undead]] like ju-ju zombies that regular ''magic missiles'' could not harm, and they even healed good beings that they struck.\n\nThe spell was unique to the clergy of Eilistraee and could not be used by a [[cleric]] of any other deity in the [[Realms]].",
        "Components": "''Eilistraee's prayer missiles'' required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s to cast.",
        "History": "''Eilistraee's prayer missiles'' was developed by a priestess of Eilistraee who traveled aboard a ''[[spelljammer]]''. The spell's purpose was specifically to be used against various [[undead]] creatures, especially juju zombies."
