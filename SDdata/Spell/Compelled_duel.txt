==Effect==
The caster would compel a duel with a target within {{SI|30|ft}}. If the target failed to resist, then it would have to try and engage with the caster. The target was at a disadvantage when attacking others and if the caster attacked someone else the spell would end.

==Components==
Only a vocal component was needed for the casting.

==History==
Some time during or before the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} the [[Thay]]an paladin [[Xenk Yendar]] compelled the [[elder brain]] [[Zuphelithid]] to a duel to the death. Xenk emerged as the victor.
