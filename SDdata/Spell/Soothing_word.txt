Soothing word was a power granted to specialty priests of Eldath called stillwaters.
By uttering the soothing word, stillwaters were able to influence anyone within  by causing them to cease hostilities and listen to the stillwater for several minutes. Anyone unable to resist the magic of the soothing word would calmly walk away from the conflict after the stillwater stopped talking.
Stillwaters could use this power many times per day depending on their skill.
