        "mainbody": "'''''Prestidigitation''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[cantrip]] that allowed a caster to perform minor, relatively harmless magic tricks. The [[wu-jen]] version of this spell was not considered a cantrip. It improved the caster's pickpocket skill and let them transport small items about their person in the blink of an eye. Its reversible form was known as '''''fumble-fingers''''' and lowered the manual dexterity of a target creature for a short time.",
        "Effects": {
            "Wu-jen Version": "Older versions of this spell, in particular practiced by [[wu jen]], allowed the caster to ''[[teleport]]'' small items (palm-sized or less) to/from their hand from/to any place on their person, such as their pocket, hat, boot, or other hand. This could be done surreptitiously or with theatrical gestures and banter. The spell lasted for at least a minute, so several such tricks could be performed in quick succession. Anyone observing the caster had a chance to resist the spell and see how the trick was done or notice the caster's action.\n\nThe wu jen ''prestidigitation'' also improved the chance of a successful pickpocket attempt by making the caster more dexterous. The victim had a chance to resist the spell, but otherwise the caster succeeded in stealing or depositing a small item without the victim's knowledge.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, '''''fumble-fingers''''', could be cast on a target creature up to {{SI|30|yd|long=yes}} away and, if successful, caused the victim to flub the next attempt that required fine dexterity, such as using a tool, reaching for an arrow or a knife, or performing a [[Somatic component|somatic]] gesture while casting a spell. It only affected relatively small actions, not large movements like swinging a sword. The spell lasted at least a minute (longer for more experienced casters) or until the victim performed an appropriate action and either succeeded or failed depending on their resistance to the spell."
        },
        "Components": "The newer versions of ''prestidigitation'' only required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s to cast. The older, wu jen versions, also required a drop of [[oil]] to be rubbed on the fingertips. ''Fumble-fingers'' instead had the caster flick the drop of oil toward the intended target.",
        "History": "The later versions of this spell could be cast as many times as the caster desired, but only a maximum of three \"continuous\" effects could be active at a time.\n\n[[File:TJN Simon.jpg|thumb|right|''\"No one can hold a candle to this trick!\"'']]\nIn the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} [[Simon Aumar]] demonstrated ''prestidigitation'' cantrips at his magic show in the [[Triboar playhouse|playhouse]] in [[Triboar]], including a ''firefinger'' and produced the smell of freshly cut grass, but impressed precisely no one.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} He had more effect later when he used it to ignite [[Themberchaud]]'s gassy belches, and triggered an explosion that released him and his fellow adventurers."
