Tears of fire was a flame evocation spell used by members of the Brotherhood of the True Flame in Zakhara.
This spell created 2-5 spheres of fire. Each sphere measured roughly  in diameter. The fire spheres followed the caster for the duration of the spell by circling around their head. These spheres radiated the same amount of illumination as a light spell and gave off the heat of a regular fire, making them capable of providing warmth and comfort for the caster and anyone close to them.
The fire spheres moved about the caster without their concentration, leaving them free to cast other spells or perform similar actions unhindered.
With a mere thought the caster could send any or all of the spheres to unerringly strike any visible foe, so long as they were within , burning them with flame. When struck with a sphere, combustible garments or items also burst into flame. The caster could direct the spheres at a single target or multiple targets at the same time.
If the caster chose to send only a single sphere at a target, they were able to simultaneously perform other actions such as spellcasting. Sending more than one sphere to attack required the casters full attention.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, tears of fire required a small candle that was made from perfumed beeswax worth at least 100 gold pieces to cast. The candle was lit and consumed during casting.
