        "mainbody": "Destructive wave (also seen as destructive smite) was a spell used by paladins.\nAfter the spell was cast, the caster struck the ground with their fist, generating a brilliant wave of divine energy that swelled outward. Any creatures within 30 feet (9 meters) of the caster were knocked over by this wave and suffered divine and necrotic damage.\nThis spell required only a verbal component."
