        "mainbody": "Spidercloak armor was an arcane conjuration spell, used in the Underdark, which surrounded the caster in a dark network of magic shadows and non-sticking webs.\nThe magical dark network acted as a barrier to both physical and magical attacks. Whilst under effect of the spell, the casters armor would be raised significantly, and could become strengthened over time, as it fluctuated. \nThe spell also cloaked the casters alignment aura, such that another spellcasters couldnt tell whether they were good or evil. Any other magical auras were also cloaked.\nAs well as verbal and somatic components, the material component could be either a spider web part or a living spider itself. The living spider would be crushed to death in the process."
