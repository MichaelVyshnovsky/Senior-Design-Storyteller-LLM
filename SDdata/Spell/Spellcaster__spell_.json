        "mainbody": "'''''Spellcaster''''' was a [[spell]] used by casters to store spells.",
        "Effects": "With this spell, a caster was able to store a spell in an object. Once stored, the newly enchanted object was able to repeatedly cast the spell. The object had to be stationary and had to have a value of more than 10,000 [[gp]]. A caster first cast this spell on the desired object and then cast the spell they wished stored. Any low level spell, except ''[[dispel magic]]'', could be stored. If for some reason the enchantment was lifted from the object, the object was not damaged.",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a [[material component]]: a hinge made from [[platinum]]. The hinge had to have a minimum value of 500 [[gp]].",
        "History": "This spell was known to be used by [[wizard]]s of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]."
