        "mainbody": "Spellcaster was a spell used by casters to store spells.\nWith this spell, a caster was able to store a spell in an object. Once stored, the newly enchanted object was able to repeatedly cast the spell. The object had to be stationary and had to have a value of more than 10,000 gp. A caster first cast this spell on the desired object and then cast the spell they wished stored. Any low level spell, except dispel magic, could be stored. If for some reason the enchantment was lifted from the object, the object was not damaged.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component a hinge made from platinum. The hinge had to have a minimum value of 500 gp.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
