        "mainbody": "Animal growth was a transmutation or alteration spell that allowed the caster to double the size of one or more animals. The reverse of this spell, shrink animal, caused animals to shrink to half their size.\nCasting this spell caused one or more animals to grow in size. This doubled each animals height, length, and width, while increasing its weight by a factor of eight. This increase in size had a number of effects including making the creature more powerful but it also made the creature easier to attack. The creatures strength and hardiness were also increased. This spell did not affect Colossal sized creatures, although the reverse of this spell could.\nWhen the spell ended, the creatures size and power returned to normal, and any injuries suffered by the creature were reduced in severity by half.\nThe caster gained no special ability to command or influence the affected animals.\nThe older version of this spell required verbal and somatic components, the spell also required a material component, a bite of food. The newer version did not require any food.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Stoca in  and was originally called Stocas fauna grow.\nIt was recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki."
