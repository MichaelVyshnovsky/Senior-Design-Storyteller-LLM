Huntsmans call was a spell unique to Maztica. The spell allowed a caster to summon game.
The spell summoned birds and mammals to the location of the caster. The spell had a very large area of effect, 1,000 yards (914 meters). While the spell summoned animals to the caster, the animals natural caution remained and would flee at the first sign of a threat or the sight of humanoids.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a whistle carved from the claw of a jaguar.
