The field was invisible but could be made to appear however the target of the spell desired, including to shine brightly enough to read by of light the path ahead for several feet.\nAlustriels mantle completely protected against physical attacks of mundane or magical weapons possessing a lower enchantment. The mantle also protected against minor spells or their equivalent magic item such as a wand of magic missiles.\nIf one of Alustriels mantles came into contact with another, and explosion of swirling magical chaos would harm both recipients of the mantles.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a small glass vial to cast.
