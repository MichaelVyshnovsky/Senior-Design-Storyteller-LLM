        "mainbody": "'''''Speed swim''''' was a simple [[spell]] that improved a creature's swimming ability.",
        "Effects": "This spell increased ability and speed while swimming. The creature's swimming speed was the same as if they were running on dry land. The spell only functioned if swimming in a single direction. The targeted creature had to be within {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} of the caster while the spell was cast. This range increased as the caster's skill level grew.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[focus]]: a small paddle made from wood."
