        "mainbody": "'''''Blood mantle''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Garagos]] called [[Bloodreaver]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell called into being a shroud of blood droplets swirling around the caster. The droplets would coagulate into an [[iron]] wall to intercept any physical attacks aimed at the caster. A ''blood mantle'' was very conductive to electricity, posing a risk for the caster while active against that form of attack. The caster was able to hurl the mantle up to {{SI|10|ft}} away to form a {{SI|10|ft}} curtain of blood to serve as a protective wall similar to the ''[[wall of iron]]'' spell but not susceptible to any rust attacks. Once thrown the ''blood mantle'' could not be moved for the spell's duration.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a red [[gemstone]] worth at least 24 [[gp]] to cast."
