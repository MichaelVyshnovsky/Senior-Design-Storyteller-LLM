        "mainbody": "Wall of evil was a spell similar to magic circle against good.\nWhen cast, this spell created a spherical or linear barrier. One side of the barrier is designated as a safe zone by the caster. The barrier prevented good creatures and their attacks from reaching the caster and anyone else on the other side of the barrier. The spell worked against conjured and summoned good creatures. The barrier had to have enough space to be unbroken, if during casting a creature or object was in the way, the spell failed.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
