'''''Dazzling ray''''' was a [[spell]] used by many [[sorcerer]]s, It sent a radiant beam of light at a target creature, injuring and possibly dazzling it.

==Effects==
This spell shot a stunningly bright beam of light at a creature within {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} of the sorcerer, injuring them with the intensity of its light. In addition, those that studied [[wild magic]] possibly dazzled their target, making them less effective in their attacks. Although easy to learn, this spell could typically only be cast once a day as it required a significant period of rest to recoup.
