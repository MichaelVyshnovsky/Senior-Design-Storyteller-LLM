Dazzling ray was a spell used by many sorcerers, It sent a radiant beam of light at a target creature, injuring and possibly dazzling it.
This spell shot a stunningly bright beam of light at a creature within  of the sorcerer, injuring them with the intensity of its light. In addition, those that studied wild magic possibly dazzled their target, making them less effective in their attacks. Although easy to learn, this spell could typically only be cast once a day as it required a significant period of rest to recoup.
