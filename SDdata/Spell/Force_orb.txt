Force orb was an evocation spell that created a number of spheres of pure energy that were shot out from the caster, directed towards several targets of their choosing.
Originally, the force orbs created by this spell approximately 3" (7.6 cm) in diameter and instantly streaked forth from the palm of the caster. They could travel well over 100 (30.5 m) and burst in 10 blasts, regardless of whether or not they struck their intended target. 
Following the Spellplague in 1385 DR, the spheres were completely imperceptible, were hurled by the caster up to 100 away, and burst into many tiny invisible daggers upon impact.
The spell required only verbal and somatic components to be cast. While it was fairly easy to learn, it required considerable concentration on the part of the spellcaster to cast.
This spell was common among the hunters that served the druidic Nentyarch of the Circle of Leth.
