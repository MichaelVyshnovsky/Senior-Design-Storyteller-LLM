Distort was a simple alteration spell used to alter sound. This spell was created by the famed wizard Darsson Spellmaker.
This spell allowed the caster to change the nature of any sound within several paces of the source of the sound. The volume of the sound stayed the same, but the pitch, timbre, resonance and tone could all be changed. All of these changes were accomplished by mental commands from the caster.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components.
