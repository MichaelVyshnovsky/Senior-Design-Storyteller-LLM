'''Foulwings''' were huge, monstrous [[aberration]]s.

==Description==
They were very large with black, leathery wings, toad-like bodies, and horse-like heads. Their skin was black and covered in "horn-shaped, wriggling skin growths." They were clumsy fliers. Their most distinctive feature was their three jaws filled with razor-sharp teeth and centered around a single snout. Their eyes glowed red in [[infravision]].

==Behavior==
Foulwings were generally considered to be lazy creatures.

Foulwings communicated with each other through animal-like grunts and calls.

==Combat==
Foulwings preferred to use their weight to pin prey or enemies under their bodies. They had the ability to breathe out [[ammonia]], causing irritation to the eyes and nose of their targets. They used their sharp teeth to pierce the flesh of a target and suck its blood.

==Ecology==
These creatures often lived solitarily, but occasionally they could be found in flocks of up to four creatures. 
===Diet===
Foulwings were a carnivorous species. They were known to hunt live prey and sometimes kept creatures captive for food, but their preferred food was carrion.
===Habitat===
Foulwings were believed to have originated on a different [[plane]], but it was not known which plane. They could be found in any environment,

===Relationships===
Foulwings were sometimes used as [[mount]]s by evil [[humanoid]]s, such as [[drow]].

Foulwings sometimes mated with [[wyvern]]s, creating a type of hybrid creature known as a [[foulvern]].

===Usages===
Foulwing flesh was unappetizing as meat, but their saliva and blood made a good caustic cleaner for metal items.

==Notable foulwings==
