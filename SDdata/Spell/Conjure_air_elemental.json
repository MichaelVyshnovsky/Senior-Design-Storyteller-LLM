        "Realmslore": "Normally, this spell was the sole purview of [[druid]]s and [[mystic]]s, but priests of [[Akadi]], the Queen of Air, and [[Aerdrie Faenya]], the Winged Mother, could also pray for this spell.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell summoned an [[air elemental]] to serve the caster. The size of the summoned creature was random, with smaller ones more likely than larger ones, but even the smallest was quite formidable. The elemental regarded the caster as a friend and ally and was willing to do the caster's bidding. Unlike the [[conjure elemental|arcane version of this spell]], the caster did not have to concentrate to maintain control of the creature and was not at risk of being attacked by it. The spell lasted for over two hours (even longer for more experienced casters) or until the air elemental was destroyed, ''dismissed'', ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'', or banished with a ''[[holy word]]'' spell, whichever came first.\n\nThe casting time for this spell was six minutes for druids and ten minutes for priests of Akadi or Aerdrie Faenya. The range at which the elemental could be ''conjured'' or ''dismissed'' was 240 ft (73 m) for druids and half that for Akadians and Aerdrians.",
