        "mainbody": "'''''Necrotic transference''''' was a daily weapon-focused prayer available to [[cleric]]s during the post-[[Spellplague]] era.",
        "Effects": "When ''necrotic transference'' was cast a weapon being wielded by the cleric would temporarily be swathed with shadowy [[necrotic energy]]. Any creature struck by the weapon while this prayer was active upon it would suffer from the necrotic energy, having some of their lifeforce drained. That lifeforce would then be transferred as a surge of healing to an ally of the cleric's choosing within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Components": "Casting this spell required the cleric to be wielding a weapon.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1420}}, a party of four [[Daggerdale]]smen [[adventurer]]s were [[teleport|summoned]] to the [[mines of Tethyamar]] by the [[Banite]] priestess [[Lorin-Aria]] to kill the [[Zhent]] wizard [[Rezlus]] and put an end to his plans to conquer Daggerdale and the greater [[Dalelands]] region. Among this party of adventurers was a [[dwarf]] [[cleric]] who knew the prayer ''necrotic transference''."
