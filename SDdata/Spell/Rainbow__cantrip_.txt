Rainbow was a minor illusion cantrip that illusionists-in-training could learn. It created a ribbon of striped colors that could move and form various shapes.
This cantrip formed a long ribbon of softly shining colors that exactly resembled a rainbow. The illusion was  long,  wide, and at least one end of the band had to be within  of the caster upon creation. This spell lasted for one minute and then the illusion faded away. The caster could choose the shape of the bow and let it remain in place for the duration of the spell (allowing the caster to move out of range), or cause it to move, twist, and turn, manipulating it with hand gestures, while staying within  of it. The illusion gave off a soft, rainbow-hued glow that was visible in non-magical darkness. Creatures that saw the rainbow and did not resist the spell had their gaze drawn to the image for a few seconds. A moving rainbow had a chance to hold their attention a few seconds longer than a stationary one.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster formed a triangular pyramid with the fingers of both hands while speaking a name of power, such as gar-land or pegee-lee.These are references to Judy Garland who famously sang Somewhere Over the Rainbow and Peggy Lee who sang the lullaby Sing a Rainbow.
