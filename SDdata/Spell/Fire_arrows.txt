}}'''''Fire arrows''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This spell caused a regular campfire to spray flaming [[arrow]]s. When the spell was cast the fire would immediately extinguish and explode into a shower of arrows. The caster determined the direction of the arrows, and stronger casters had more arrows to control versus weaker casters.

==Components==
This spell required a handful of [[sand]] to cast.
