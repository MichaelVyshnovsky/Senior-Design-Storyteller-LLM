Fire arrows was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell caused a regular campfire to spray flaming arrows. When the spell was cast the fire would immediately extinguish and explode into a shower of arrows. The caster determined the direction of the arrows, and stronger casters had more arrows to control versus weaker casters.
This spell required a handful of sand to cast.
