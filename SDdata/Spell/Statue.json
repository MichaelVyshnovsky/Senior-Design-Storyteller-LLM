        "mainbody": "Statue was an arcane alteration spell that changed the recipient together with anything worn to stone, but kept their faculties and senses intact. In older versions the magical transformation carried a certain risk of immediate death, but if successful, all versions allowed the affected person or creature to hide in plain sight as a statue, with all the resiliency of stone. The recipient could turn back to their normal form at will.\nApart from verbal and somatic components, the caster had to stir some lime, sand, and water with a rodlike piece of iron.\nThe statue spell was first introduced in the time of Netheril, in 1839 NY (−2020 DR), under the name Quantouls statue, after famous variator arcanist Quantoul.\nStatue was an uncommon spell to the magical community of Faerûn by 1358 DR."
