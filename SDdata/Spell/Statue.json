        "mainbody": "'''''Statue''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that changed the recipient together with anything worn to stone, but kept their faculties and senses intact. In older versions the magical transformation carried a certain risk of immediate death, but if successful, all versions allowed the affected person or creature to hide in plain sight as a statue, with all the resiliency of stone. The recipient could turn back to their normal form at will.",
