        "mainbody": "Paralyzation was an arcane illusion spell that created the illusion of muscle slowness in targets.\nThis spell would not function if used upon mindless creatures. The spell affected the weakest targets first within a  cube, becoming paralyzed for an hour if they were unable to resist the spell.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThis spell was found within Selvars Ineffable Conjurations, Magicks, and Phantasms."
