        "mainbody": "''''' Mordenkainen's faithful phantom guardian''''' was an uncommon [[spell]] that summoned a spectral guardian.",
        "Effects": "With this spell, the caster was able to summon a phantom guardian for protection. The guardian watched over the caster from the [[Ethereal Plane]]. The guardian was able to see everything around the caster in a {{SI|60|ft}} radius. It was able to see astral, duo-dimensional, ethereal, invisible, or out-of-phase creatures. If the guardians detected a threat to the caster, they instantly appeared on the [[Prime Material Plane]] next to the caster. The guardian did not speak and appeared as a transparent figure outlined with a faint shimmering purple light. It fought to defend the caster until either the threat was eliminated or the guardian itself was destroyed. The caster was able to summon the guardian to their side at any time after the spell was cast.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: an expensive [[diamond]], which had to be valued at at least 1,000 [[gp]] and was given to the guardian during casting."
