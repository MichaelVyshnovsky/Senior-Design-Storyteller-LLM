'''''Listen''''' was a person-affecting [[cantrip]] that [[wizard]]s-in-training could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It conveyed a short message to a nearby entity, alerting them of the caster's presence if they were not already cognizant.

==Effects==
This cantrip worked on one target creature within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}<ref group="note">The original range was {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} as specified in [[Dragon magazine 100|''Dragon'' #100]] and ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' but was halved in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. that the caster could see. This spell did not amplify the caster's voice and could not overcome any sound barriers between the caster and the target, nor hearing impediments (such as deafness or magical ''[[silence]]''). In addition, the target had to understand the language the caster used for precise meaning to be conveyed. It was most useful across a crowded room or a busy street. The message sent could be up to about six words long and did not, by itself, interfere with the concentration or spellcasting of the target creature.<ref group="note">But a humorous quip might, for example. Unlike the ''[[message]]'' spell and cantrip, the recipient could not reply to the sender.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster first pointed at the target creature, then back at themselves while saying the word "ahem". It was the visual line-of-sight and not the pointing that determined the target.

==History==
This cantrip was one of three unique cantrips (along with ''[[Horn (cantrip)|horn]]'' and ''[[scorch]]'') recorded in ''[[Glanvyl's Workbook]]'', penned by the relatively unknown [[Glanvyl]] of [[Scornubel]] in the 11{{th}} century [[DR]].The three cantrips described in [[Dragon magazine 100|''Dragon'' #100]] were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''.
