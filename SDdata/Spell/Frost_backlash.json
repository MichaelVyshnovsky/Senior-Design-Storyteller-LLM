        "mainbody": "'''''Frost backlash''''' is a fairly complex [[spell]] learned by [[swordmage]] initiates, particularly those of the [[Swordmage#Shielding Swordmage|shielding]] style of [[arcane magic|arcane]] swordplay. Unlike most spells, ''frost backlash'' can be cast instantaneously, and is used to transform the [[magic]]al warding projected by all swordmages into frigid ice, which explodes out from the swordmage's weapon when they are injured by a nearby enemy. Even if the spell misses its target, the wave of cold energy still injures the attacker, making ''frost backlash'' an effective form of retaliation. ''Frost backlash'' is fairly difficult to cast and, as such, can only be used once per day.",
