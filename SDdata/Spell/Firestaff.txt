'''''Firestaff''''' was a rare [[evocation]] [[spell]] that added magical flame to a wooden melee weapon.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell created a brilliant sphere of blue flame on either end of a melee weapon made from wood. Items that this spell could be cast upon were a club, log, pole, staff, or a large branch from a tree. The spell lit both ends of the object; the caster was unable to light just one end. The fire vanished after the spell expired. The magical flame did not damage the weapon.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: a piece of [[phosphorous]] and [[iron filings]]. If phosphorous was unavailable, regular fire was an acceptable substitute.

==History==
''Firestaff'' was one of the spells within ''[[Galadaster's Orizon]]''.
