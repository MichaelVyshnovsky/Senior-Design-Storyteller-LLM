'''''Royalberry''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Sheela Peryroyl]].
 
==Effects==
The caster casts this spell on a handful of berries. A single berry now provided the equivalent nourishment of a full meal. They also provided limited healing of wounds. If the individual was poisoned, the single berry acted in the same manner as ''[[slow poison]]''. If more than three berries were consumed, they acted in the same manner as ''[[neutralize poison]]''. If someone at six berries, they had the same effects as ''[[cure disease]]''. Unlike the ''[[goodberry]]'' spell, this spell was not reversible.
 
==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Sheela Peryroyl and a handful of berries, which had to be freshly picked.
