Royalberry was a spell used by clerics of Sheela Peryroyl.
The caster casts this spell on a handful of berries. A single berry now provided the equivalent nourishment of a full meal. They also provided limited healing of wounds. If the individual was poisoned, the single berry acted in the same manner as slow poison. If more than three berries were consumed, they acted in the same manner as neutralize poison. If someone at six berries, they had the same effects as cure disease. Unlike the goodberry spell, this spell was not reversible.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Sheela Peryroyl and a handful of berries, which had to be freshly picked.
