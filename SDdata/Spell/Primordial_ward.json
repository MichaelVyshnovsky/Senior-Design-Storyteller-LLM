        "mainbody": "Primordial ward was an abjuration spell that conferred protection from a variety of elements on its caster.\nThe spell granted the caster magical resistance against acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder for up to 1 minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating. Additionally, the spells energy could be concentrated on a single element, completely blocking any damage of the chosen type for a few seconds, after which the spell ended.\nThe spell only required verbal and somatic components."
