        "mainbody": "Re-target was a metamagic spell that allowed a cleric to redirect a single spell so that it affected a different person or creature.\nFor the spells duration, the caster of re-target had the ability to choose a different target for any single spell cast within its area of effect. The cleric gained no knowledge about the affected spell as it was being cast, so they may not have known which spell they were redirecting. If that spell targeted a new person or creature outside the range of its specifications it was negated.\nThe duration of re-target continued for a matter of seconds, to well over a minute, depending on the skill and experience of the casting cleric. It had an effective range of 120 (36.6 m).\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of the clerics holy symbol as well as a small silver that was consumed upon casting."
