        "mainbody": "'''''Re-target''''' was a [[metamagic]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[cleric]] to redirect a single spell so that it affected a different person or creature.",
        "Effects": "For the spell's duration, the caster of ''re-target'' had the ability to choose a different target for any single spell cast within its area of effect. The cleric gained no knowledge about the affected spell as it was being cast, so they may not have known which spell they were redirecting. If that spell targeted a new person or creature outside the range of its specifications it was negated.\n\nThe duration of ''re-target'' continued for a matter of seconds, to well over a minute, depending on the skill and experience of the casting cleric. It had an effective range of 120' (36.6 m).",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the use of the cleric's ''[[holy symbol]]'' as well as a small [[silver]] that was consumed upon casting."
