Spell trigger was a spell used by wizards.
A caster used this spell to store three spells within a sequencer, which was any item the caster chose. When triggered, the item released all three spells simultaneously. The caster could only have one sequencer at a time. The sequencer only functioned while in possession of the caster they were not able to give it to another individual.
