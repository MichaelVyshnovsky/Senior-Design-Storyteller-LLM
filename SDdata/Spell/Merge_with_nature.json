        "mainbody": "Merge with nature was a powerful divine alteration and necromancy spell used by priestesses devoted to Sune, enabling them to avoid old age by becoming a dryad.\nPriestesses of Sune used this spell to avoid the effects of old age and even death by permanently transforming into a dryad. Only higher-ranking and particularly desperate priestesses used this spell. This spell fell out of favor with the Church of Sune but was retained by the Sunite liturgy.\nThe caster united herself with a subject tree, allowing her to transform into a dryad. The priestess lost all of her divine abilities in exchange for the powers and skills of a true dryad. The transformation was quite stressful on the priestesses body, sometimes resulting in their death.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a tree willing to accept the dryad to cast."
