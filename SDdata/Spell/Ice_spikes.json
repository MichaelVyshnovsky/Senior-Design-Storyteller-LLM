        "mainbody": "'''''Ice spikes''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell given to [[specialty priest]]s of [[Auril]], the Frostmaiden.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell created a ball of hard ice around the caster's hand. The ball was covered in sharp spikes of ice, similar to a [[mace]]. For the duration of the spell, the caster's hand were protected from harm. Due to the nature of the spell, while the spell was in effect, the caster was unable to cast most spells and they were unable to use their hands for anything but the most basic of tasks. The caster could channel some of their life energy into the spell, which increased the damage the ice fists inflicted.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[Verbal component|verbal]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], an icicle or a shaving of ice."
