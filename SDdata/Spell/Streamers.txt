Streamers  was an evocation spell that caused ribbon-like projectiles to shoot from the casters hand. They would independently fly to their target and hover over them, waiting for them to move or take action, after which they would attack.
When cast, multiple streamers could be sent to different creatures or all could target a single subject.
This spell required the material component of a 6-inch strand of spider silk.
