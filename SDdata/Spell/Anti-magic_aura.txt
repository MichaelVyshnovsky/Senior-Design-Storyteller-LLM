'''''Anti-magic aura''''' was an [[elven]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that prevented a single individual from casting any spells, accessing any spell-like abilities and rendered any [[Item enchantment|magical]] items on their person inert for a short duration of time.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, the ''anti-magic aura'' appeared around the profile of the affected individual in the form of glittering light. While the aura was active, they could not cast any [[arcane]] or [[divine]] spells and had no access to any [[magic]]al energy or powers, such as inherent spell-like abilities. Furthermore, any [[weapon]]s they held were temporarily stripped of their enhancements and functioned as non-magical versions of their basic weapon type.

The duration of the ''anti-magi aura'' lasted for just over a minute, but could continue on longer, depending on the power and experience of the caster. The aura could be successfully ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' by any unaffected [[spellcaster]].

==Usage==
''Anti-magic aura'' functioned in a similar manner to the  spell ''[[anti-magic shell]]'' but was meant for offensive use, to neutralize any hostile spellcasters.

This spell was unique to the [[elves]] of [[Evermeet]]. The specifications of its casting was a well-guarded secret by the [[Tel-quessir]] of that realm.

==Casting==
This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to be cast.
