'''Squid ships''', formally '''cephalopod-class brigs''', were squid-shaped [[spelljammer]]s. Because of their simple design, ease of use and maneuverability, they were very popular vessels among traders and explorers.

==Description==
Squid ships merged elements of seafaring sailing ships with the elegant and functional design of [[nautiloid]]s. Their simple design allowed squid ships to be operated by a relatively small crew. When employed for trading purposes, squid ships typically held a minimum complement of 12 individuals. When in space, the ship could support a maximum complement of 45 individuals without compromising its air supply.

On a typical squid ship manned by a [[human]] crew, the bridge and captain's post was located in the aftcastle, with the [[spelljamming helm]] hidden underneath. Communication between the captain and helmsman was attained via speaking tubes.

Squid ships were primarily employed for trading and adventuring purposes, although their powerful ram and maneuverability also made them favored by pirates and military navies.

==History==
It was rumored that squid ships were originally designed by humans who had escaped slavery by [[mind flayer]]s. This was due to their combination of human and illithid designs.

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Morkoth (ship)|''Morkoth'']], a sea-bound squid ship, was employed by the [[Kraken Society]] as a prison for king [[Hekaton]].

Around the same time, the ''[[Scavenger (spelljammer)|Scavenger]]'', a large {{SIAdj|290|ft|adj=long}} squid ship, was captured by [[Halaster Blackcloak]] while orbiting [[Toril]] and trapped in [[Undermountain]]. Halaster stole the ship's helm and left the crew marooned within the dungeon.
