        "mainbody": "ream was a complex type of giant rune that could grant its caster prophetic visions if done correctly.\nIf a caster placed their runed stone beneath a pillow and slept on it they would have prophetic dreams, related to the question they had in mind during the shaping process, for around one to six days. Like many prophetic visions, these dreams would involve a myriad of strange and enigmatic symbols that needed to be interpreted in order to obtain their meaning.\nIf during the shaping process the caster had not properly framed a single question within their mind and thus improperly shaped the rune, then instead of receiving prophetic dreams they would be visited by a ghast for around one to six days.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune binding. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to twelve hours and it needed to be inscribed upon a broad stone. During this shaping process the caster needed to frame a single question within their mind and alter the rune accordingly."
