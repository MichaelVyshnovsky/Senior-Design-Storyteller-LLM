        "mainbody": "Eagles splendor was a transmutation spell that made the subject more charismatic.\nWhen successfully cast, the targeted creature exuded charisma, their body language become more poised, their speech was more articulate and their personality became a force to be reckoned with. If this spell was cast on a bard or a sorcerer, their respective spells had a increased effect on creatures.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a handful of feathers or a pinch of dung from an eagle."
