'''''Rain of terror''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the school of [[evocation]] unique to the [[Domains of Dread]].<ref group="note">''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Three]]'' marks ''Rain of terror'' as a [[:Category:Zakharan spells|Zakharan spell]] from the ''[[Al-Qadim]]'' campaign setting.

==Effects==
This spell created a cursed rain storm that took effect over the course of half an hour. The spell would begin immediately if storm clouds were present at the time of casting. The storm lasted for at least one hour, and longer depending on the skill of the caster, covering an area of {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} in a circle centered on the caster.

The caster was able to pick the nature of the cursed rainfall based on their skill. Potential choices included black putrid water, ash, steaming blood, toads, dead [[bat]]s, [[snake]]s, and [[spider]]s. Half of the living creatures that rained down survived the impact with the ground. Though they were harmless, the living creatures added an element of terror to the storm.

==Components==
This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
