Magic mouth, originally known as Carburys mouth, was an illusion spell, that created the glamer of a mouth upon a creature or object that would deliver a message when a trigger event occurred.
This spell allowed the caster to create an illusion of a speaking mouth upon a chosen object or creature within close proximity. The spell would remain in effect until the triggering event occurred, which could be any visual or audible trigger chosen by the caster that took place within a limited distance, which depended upon the power of the caster but was at least fifteen feet.
When triggered, the mouth would appear and speak a recorded message of 25 words or fewer in any language, but such a message was incapable of acting as a trigger for another spell or magical item or as a verbal component.
The message could not propagate across the void of wildspace.
Verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell, along with a small amount of honey and jade dust.
The spell was invented by the Netherese arcanist Carbury in , the same year in which he also created his spectral force spell.
