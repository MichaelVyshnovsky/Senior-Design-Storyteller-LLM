        "mainbody": "Laerals raging griffon was an evocation wizard spell developed by Laeral Silverhand.\nThis spell created a magical translucent shape in the form of a griffon. The construct was completely controlled by the caster. The caster could treat the construct as a mount and even see through its eyes. The construct was not as agile during flight if mounted.\nIf damaged to the point of \"death\" the construct would simply disappear.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components either a griffon feather or tuft of hair from a griffon tail to cast."
