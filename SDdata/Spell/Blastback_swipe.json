        "mainbody": "Blastback swipe was a spell used by some swordmages, particularly those of the assault style.\nWhen cast, even when charging, blastback swipe caused the swordmages weapon to strike a foe with the force and sound of a thunderclap. The sonic energy not only caused the creature extra injury, but also pushed them back 10 feet (3 meters).\nAssault swordmages could also use it for their aegis of assault spell."
