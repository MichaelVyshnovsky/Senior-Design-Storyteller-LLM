        "mainbody": "Watching shadow was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Mask, enabling them to see through a shadow.\nThis spell created a mobile shadow that allowed the caster to see anything near the shadow. The caster could move the watching shadow around by silent will, visualizing the shadows surroundings out to a point that their own eyes would normally be able to see. Walls with lead or gorgons blood served as an effective barrier to this spell. This spell would end if the caster began casting another spell.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
