        "mainbody": "'''''Binding chain of fate''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a chain composed of force energy, which bound a person or creature in place, in turn creating a number of other magical effects.",
        "Effects": "When this spell was cast, the ''chain of fate'' looped around the target and rang out with a metallic clang. After the affecting being was a bound, an oscillating ring of energy surrounded them at a distance of {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nFor the duration of the spell, the bound individual could not move beyond the area defined by the ring of energy. If they were in flight, or otherwise above the ground, at the time of the spell's casting, they were bound midair, as if they were standing upon a solid surface. The ''chain of fate'' prevented them from altering their form, in the case of [[lycanthrope]]s or other [[shapechanger]]s, damaged them with [[force]] energy and acted as both a ''[[dimensional anchor]]'' and ''[[antimagic field]]''. \n\nThe chain could not be ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' but could be readily destroyed by the spells ''[[disintegrate]]'' or ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction]]'', as well as by use of a ''[[rod of cancellation]]''. It was possible for certain beings to completely resist the effects of the spell outright.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]] in the form of a small [[chain]] made of [[silver]]."
