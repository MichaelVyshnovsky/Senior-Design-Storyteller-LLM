        "mainbody": "Binding chain of fate was an evocation spell that created a chain composed of force energy, which bound a person or creature in place, in turn creating a number of other magical effects.\nWhen this spell was cast, the chain of fate looped around the target and rang out with a metallic clang. After the affecting being was a bound, an oscillating ring of energy surrounded them at a distance of .\nFor the duration of the spell, the bound individual could not move beyond the area defined by the ring of energy. If they were in flight, or otherwise above the ground, at the time of the spells casting, they were bound midair, as if they were standing upon a solid surface. The chain of fate prevented them from altering their form, in the case of lycanthropes or other shapechangers, damaged them with force energy and acted as both a dimensional anchor and antimagic field. \nThe chain could not be dispelled but could be readily destroyed by the spells disintegrate or Mordenkainens disjunction, as well as by use of a rod of cancellation. It was possible for certain beings to completely resist the effects of the spell outright.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component in the form of a small chain made of silver."
