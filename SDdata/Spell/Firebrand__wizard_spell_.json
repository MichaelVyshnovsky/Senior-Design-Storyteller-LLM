        "mainbody": "'''''Firebrand''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a flame that burned for the spell's duration without consuming the object it was cast upon.",
        "Effects": "Once cast upon an object or spot, the fire could not be moved but the caster could extinguish the flame at any time. This spell was useful when cast upon a weapon to temporarily transform it into a flaming version without actually damaging the weapon. The ''firebrand'' flames would even burn underwater. A caster could also cover part of their body, or an ally's, with flames that would not harm them.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, ''quenchtouch'', created black flames upon an object that would extinguish any other flame that it came into contact with.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]]s a flame and a pinch of sulphur to cast.\n\n''Quenchtouch'' required a drop of water to cast.",
        "History": "This spell was found within ''[[Shandaril's Workbook]]''."
