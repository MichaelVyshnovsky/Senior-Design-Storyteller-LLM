The '''''spellseeking worm''''' was a spell used against [[Tsjancy Yildree]] during his time as the [[Magister]].The spell is not confirmed to be divination, but by function, it is assumed to be one.

==Effects==
The spell performed or enabled some form of tracking which bypassed many ways of hiding.

==History==
The spell was used by [[Urboltar Highymhelver]] to track [[Tsjancy Yildree]], the [[Magister]], whom he later slew in {{yearlink|531}}. The spell was successful, in spite of Tsjancy's grasp of magic being excellent and his powers being boosted by the office of the Magister.
