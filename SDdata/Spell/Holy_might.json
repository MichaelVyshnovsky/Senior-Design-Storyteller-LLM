        "mainbody": "'''''Holy might''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[priest]] to fortify an object, made of inorganic materials, so that it did not decompose or degrade over time.",
        "Effects": "This spell affected a mass of non-organic material no larger than twice the size of the caster's body. When cast, any weaknesses in the targeted material were strengthened, fortified from future damage and made even more hardy.",
        "Components": "The [[material component]]s of this spell included a whole gem; either a [[ruby]], [[sapphire]] or [[emerald]] worth at least 3,000 [[gp]]; a similarly sized piece of [[duskwood]]; a chunk of [[obsidian]] of any size; some acid taken from a [[black dragon]]; and a piece of chitin taken from either an [[ankheg]], [[bulette]], or [[beholder]]."
