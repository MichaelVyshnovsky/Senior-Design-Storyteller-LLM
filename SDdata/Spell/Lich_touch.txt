Lich touch was an arcane necromancy spell that temporarily granted the caster the power of a lichs chilling touch as well as immunity from most lich-like abilities and effects.
By means of this spell, a necromancer gained the painful paralyzing touch of a lich. Lich touch lasted for a number of minutes equal to the casters level and could not be prematurely terminated. While this spell was active, the casters hands glowed with an eerie greenish radiance, and anyone successfully touched by the caster was subject to the damage and paralysis inflicted by a true lich, unless they could resist the magic of this spell. If paralyzed, the victim remained immobile for up to eight hours, or until a sufficient dispel magic or remove paralysis was applied. The caster also gained immunity to all fear and paralysis spells and effects, including those of a lich, until the lich touch expired.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component in the form of a drop of the casters blood and a sample of rancid meat or fish.
This spell was found in the tome "Studies in Death", written down by the lich Kyristan. It was later published in "Volos Guide to All Things Magical" and became generally known to the magical community.
