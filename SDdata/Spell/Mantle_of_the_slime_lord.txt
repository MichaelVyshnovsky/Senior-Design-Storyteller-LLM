Mantle of the slime lord was an abjuration spell that coated the caster in a glossy layer of protective energy that resembled viscous, grimy water.
While the caster was protected by this gelatinous coating, they were immune to poison any spells or spell-like effects that left them paralyzed, stunned, or polymorphed or those that could otherwise put the caster to sleep. They also became well-protected from physical attacks that were normally quite deadly. 
Lastly, for the duration of the spell, the caster was completely ignored by any non-intelligent oozes such as mustard jellies or gelatinous cubes. 
This protective layer of slime did not effect the casters movements or otherwise hinder their actions. It lasted for a matter of hours, depending on the skill and power of the caster. 
This spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast, as well as the use of a divine focus. 
This spell was only available to initiates of the drow deity Ghaunadaur.
