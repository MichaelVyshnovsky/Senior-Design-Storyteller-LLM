This included not only curing any negative effects of the Spellplague, but also negating any benefits that the subject may have received from their spellscar.\nThe ritual entailed 7,000 gp worth of components and took thirty minutes to enact, following which the curative effects were instantaneous.\nThe means to remove a spellscar were discovered by the wizards of Deep Imaskar sometime shortly before the , and was only achieved after extensive experimentation. The development of processes not only to cure plaguechanged individuals but to clense plaguechanged locations was part of the Deep Imaskaris broader efforts to push back against the dangerous plagueland that surrounded their home. By 1479 DR, they were happy to hire adventurers to test their countermeasures or to collect test subjects for their research.\nPrior to the Second Sundering, some healers could provide purify spellscarred as a service, although it could cost 20,000 gp for the ritual."
