        "mainbody": "'''''Purify spellscarred''''' was a [[ritual]] designed to remove the influence of the [[Spellplague]] from any willing [[spellscarred]] individual.",
        "Effects": "The caster of the ritual laid their hands upon the ritual's target to heal them of their [[spellscar]], along with any physical or mental signs that they had been [[plaguechanged]]. This included not only curing any negative effects of the Spellplague, but also negating any benefits that the subject may have received from their spellscar.",
        "Components": "The ritual entailed 7,000 [[gp]] worth of [[material component|components]] and took thirty minutes to enact, following which the curative effects were instantaneous.",
        "History": "The means to remove a spellscar were discovered by the [[wizard]]s of [[Deep Imaskar]] sometime shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, and was only achieved after extensive experimentation. The development of processes not only to cure plaguechanged individuals but to [[purge Spellplague|clense plaguechanged locations]] was part of the Deep Imaskari's broader efforts to push back against the dangerous [[plagueland]] that surrounded their home. By 1479 DR, they were happy to hire [[adventurer]]s to test their countermeasures or to collect test subjects for their research.\n\nPrior to the [[Second Sundering]], some healers could provide ''purify spellscarred'' as a service, although it could cost 20,000 gp for the ritual."
