'''''Enhance plant''''' was a spell common for [[hedge wizard]]s and other nature specialists. It enhanced a plant.

==Effects==
The spell allowed a single natural plant (thus excluding [[shambling mound]]s and [[hangman tree]]s amongst others) to be enhanced in one aspect, such as faster growth, sweeter fruit, broader leaves, and so on. The effect was not reversible by ''[[dispel magic]]'', nor did it carry over to its offspring.

==Components==
The spell required both [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, as well as a [[material component]], possibly the plant to be enhanced.
