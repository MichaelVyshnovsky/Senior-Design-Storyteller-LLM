        "mainbody": "Water blast was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell turned a regular bottle, or vial, of water into a deadly weapon. The caster opened the bottle and aimed the opening at a target, striking one target at a time as a magic missile would.\nThe water would always strike the targets face unless otherwise prevented from doing so. In addition to causing physical damage, the water blast blinded a target unless they did not have eyes.\nA bottle of holy water used this way caused additional damage to the undead.\nThis spell required a bottle of water to cast."
