'''''Continual flame''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a magical flame.

==Effect==
The flame did not cause any damage or heat and could not be quenched or smothered as it did not need oxygen. Other than its magical nature, the flame looked normal, cast as much light as a [[torch]] and could be covered to dim the light. The flame would remain until it was dispelled. The older version would dispel ''[[darkness]]''.

==Users==
[[Hound archon]]s were known to be able to create a similar effect whenever they wanted as one of their innate magical abilities.<ref name=MM-p17>

==Components==
To cast the spell, the caster would need [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, and [[ruby]] dust worth 50 [[gold piece]]s.
