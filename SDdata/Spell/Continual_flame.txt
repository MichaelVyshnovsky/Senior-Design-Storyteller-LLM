Continual flame was an evocation spell that created a magical flame.
The flame did not cause any damage or heat and could not be quenched or smothered as it did not need oxygen. Other than its magical nature, the flame looked normal, cast as much light as a torch and could be covered to dim the light. The flame would remain until it was dispelled. The older version would dispel darkness.
Hound archons were known to be able to create a similar effect whenever they wanted as one of their innate magical abilities.
To cast the spell, the caster would need verbal and somatic components, and ruby dust worth 50 gold pieces.
