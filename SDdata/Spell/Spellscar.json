        "mainbody": "The first appearance or emergence of a spellscar could be traumatizing. The event was sometimes accompanied by an eruption of plaguefire that disfigured the spellscarred individual and others nearby, or in some cases, caused the destruction of people and places in the immediate vicinity. Individuals who experienced such a catastrophic awakening of their spellscar were known as spellscarred harbingers, and were often feared and hated for the destruction that they had unintentionally caused.\nWhile any creature could become spellscarred, giants, goblinoids, illithids, kobolds, lizardfolk, marine creatures, wyverns, It was possible to acquire more than one spellscar.\nMerely having a spellscar allowed afflicted individuals to sense the presence of the Spellplague nearby, but those spellscarred who wished to manifest more powerful, strange, and unique abilities had to train to do so. Many spellscarred individuals lifespans were extended by one to two decades, and in rare cases, this longevity was inherited by their children.\nWhile the powers bestowed by spellscars were generally beneficial to the afflicted individual, the use of a spellscar often came with a cost. Having a spellscar generally rendered the bearer more susceptible to the energies of the Spellplague, Some spellscarred individuals suffered from disturbing dreams or bizarre visions which sometimes conveyed obscure secrets about the nature of magic. Activating a spellscar within the confines of a mythal caused that mythal to treat the spellscarred individual as an intruder within its field. \nThose spellscarred individuals who devoted themselves to studying and training with their spellscar generally gained the ability to wield fire- and force-based powers or energies that could wither both the body and mind. Some could grant themselves additional powers by focusing their spellscars energies, such as by funneling the blue flames to their eyes to see invisibility\nWith sufficient training, so-called spellscarred savants could overcome many of the inherent limitations of their spellscars, and even tap into spellfire to heal themselves and energize or vaporize others as they saw fit. While potent, spellscars did not generally confer the types of monstrous power seen in creatures that had been plaguechanged in more extreme fashion.\nSpellscars first appeared in the , as a consequence of the Spellplague. The initial wave of the Spellplague often caused more extreme mutations than just spellscars, but in the following years, the scars became more common among those exposed to pockets of the Spellplague, and spellscarred individuals could be encountered all across Toril and Abeir. in Samarach, near the Plaguewrought Land in the Vilhon Wilds, and in the Underdark, such as in ChChitl, the Deep Wastes, \nthumb|left|A spellscarred individual blocks a spell.Spellscarred and plaguechanged individuals were often viewed as abominations, and as harbingers of fear and madness. Thus, they were often treated as outcasts, regardless of their own attitude toward their spellscar. while in the cities, the spellscarred were often quarantined in some fashion Waterdeep preferred them to stay in Skullport or the slums of Mistshore, Baldurs Gate unofficially quarantined them to Scarred Alley outside the city walls, and Neverwinter held them first in a treatment center in the House of Knowledge before exiling them to Helms Hold per the controversial \"Protectors Law\". Helms Hold was the closest thing to a safe haven for spellscarred individuals, but even there they were not allowed in some taverns and faced a growing movement to expel them because of their \"impurity\". Elsewhere across Faer√ªn, the spellscarred were seen as lesser members of society in Amn and as deformed in the Moonsea. and in Turmish, the Emerald Enclave ruthlessly killed them, viewing their spellscars as blights against the natural order. Meanwhile, as of the , the wizards of Deep Imaskar were experimenting on spellscarred individuals, and had also led them to develop a way to remove spellscars entirely.\nStill, there were those who were proud of their spellscars,\nWith the return of Mystra in the late 15 century DR, spellscars ceased to function as the Spellplague began to dissipate. Those who had visible scars or marks found that they now appeared as mundane but vivid tattoos, which in rare cases might glow when they cast arcane spells. In the years following the Second Sundering, many spellscars faded&mdashand, in rare cases, even disappeared entirely&mdashwhile others gained new magical properties.\nthumb|Vansi Bloodscar with her spellscar activating.\n* Beaugrat, a barbarian whose spellscar allowed him to fire blasts of blue flame.\n* Vansi Bloodscar, an orc of the Many-Arrows tribe whose spellscar manifested as a ridge of fiery bones and spikes extending from her skin.\n* Sophraea Carver, whose spellscar granted her a limited sixth sense.\n* Catti-brie developed a spellscar in the shape of an hourglass before her death.
