'''''Rapture''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Sune]], enabling them to cause others to experience pure bliss.

==Effects==
The target of this spell experienced pure bliss, temporarily banishing all fear, pain, and other feelings. ''Rapture'' protected the target from any attack against their libido such as a [[siren]]'s song. They were also immune to any attacks against their mind.

Though ''rapture'' certainly carried plenty of benefits, the spell was so strong that it stood a chance of actually stunning the target with the state of bliss, causing them to simply stand motionless for the spell's duration.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
