Disbelief was a divine enchantment spell from the thought sphere that allowed the caster to convince themselves that objects or creatures did not exist.
The caster could use this spell to temporaily convince themselves that objects or creatures within the area of effect did not exist, meaning that they could not interact in any way with the caster for the spells duration. On the flip side, the caster could also not interact in any way with the same objects or creatures. If the caster received physical harm from the disbelieved subjects in reality while the spell was active, then the caster would experience one eighth to one half of that harm when the spell expired.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
The Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the Mystran faith, could cast the disbelief spell.
