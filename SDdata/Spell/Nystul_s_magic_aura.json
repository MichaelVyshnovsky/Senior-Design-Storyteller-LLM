        "mainbody": "Nystuls magic aura, also referred to as Mystras lingering touch, and Arcanists magic aura, was an illusion spell that masked the magical aura of an item.\nTo Zakharan mages, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as magic aura, and counted among the spells of the universal province.\nOn casting Nystuls magic aura, a touched item would be detected as either as an utterly non-magical item or as a magic item of the casters choosing. For example, the caster could pick up a random sword and make it appear as if it had the vorpal quality. However, the spell did not change the appearance of the object for example, claiming a sword to be a vorpal sword, despite the sword not being of a quality that could hold any magic, was bound to raise suspicions. Furthermore, there was a chance for the magical aura to be determined as fake by means of investigating the enchanted object, for example by using an identify spell. \nNystuls magic aura required somatic and verbal components as well as a focus in the form of a small square of silk that needed to be passed over the item to be enchanted. \nThis spell was made available to the dweomerkeepers who served Mystra, the third personification of the Goddess of Magic."
