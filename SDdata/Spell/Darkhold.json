        "Structure": {
            "Interior": "Darkhold was huge and could house over a thousand men, and was built to such a scale, that it could have been occupied by [[giant]]s. It was said that its halls and central courtyard were each large enough to host grand battles.\n\nTunnels and rooms were bored into the side of the mountain to serve as escape routes and storage chambers. It was speculated that some of the secret tunnels were the home of the ancient sorcerer-turned-[[lich]] who claimed Darkhold as her lair."
        },
        "Activities": {
            "Combat and Arcana": "Zhent patrols from the fortress extended well beyond the Far Hills, as far away as [[Yellow Snake Pass]],—for their mutual benefit.\n\nWithin the deepest chambers of Darkhold, Zhentarim agents conducted horrific arcane research and experimentation. They used the fortress to house, and even breed, terrible creatures, such as [[groundling]]s [[render]]s, [[deepspawn]],",
            "Accessibility": "Darkhold was linked to the Zhentarim's other two strongholds—[[Zhentil Keep]] and the [[Citadel of the Raven]]—by powerful ''[[portal]]s'' that were only accessible to the Black Network's [[Inner Circle]]."
        },
        "Organization": "The title \"Master of Darkhold\" was bestowed upon the one-time apprentice of Manshoon's and member of the Inner Ring of Power, [[Sememmon]]. He and his elven apprentice, [[Ashemmi]] ran the stronghold for many years. The de facto leader of the troops was the supposed fallen paladin, the [[Pereghost]], and the Chaplain of [[Bane]], [[Kurth Dracomore]], was the spiritual leader.\n\nOther Zhentarim leaders of note included:\n* [[Riviar Darkwind]], the Pereghost's second in command and leader of the keep's elite fighters, the [[Storm Watch]].\n* [[Nimos Palantor]], captain of the keep's archers, the [[Grey Feathers]].\n* [[Otto Otturka]], the keep's quartermaster and \"leader\" of the militia troops, the [[Darkhold Militia]] and the [[Popular Militia]].\n* [[Imir Castdie]], a self-proclaimed \"giant king\" who leads a group of some thirty [[hill giant|hill giants]].\n* [[Angus Materi]], the captain of the keep's cavalry, the [[Outriders]].",
        "Defenses": {
            "Forces": "As of the 1360s DR, Darkhold boasted a force of 1,000 trained defenders,\n\nAmong the other military groups known to fight under Darkhold's banner were the [[Blood Axe Smashers]].\n\nThe Zhentarim employed [[wyvern]]-mounted riders that would lead ambushes on caravans traveling through the nearby trade routes.",
            "Other Defenses": "Beyond its unique structure and ample military forces, Darkhold was protected by myriad deadly [[trap]]s, both [[magic]]al and mechanical in their creation."
        },
        "History": {
            "Early History": "According to legend, Darkhold castle was constructed as a summer home for a group of giants of [[the North]], that were members of a \"Giant Empire\". There was some debate whether or not these giants were actually slaves to [[Netherese]] mages. Regardless of the truth, when the Netheril empire fell, the giants continued to occupy Darkhold.\n\nThe Giant-Emperors raided the surrounded lands including the [[Tunlands]] and the [[halfling]] lands of [[Sunset Vale]]. They did so until they fell to in-fighting among themselves. It was thought that two rival giant-princes vied for the throne and slew their father, all of the other giant occupants, and eventually each other. Rumors persisted that the princes haunted the castle, whispering conspiracies into any current occupants' ears and setting them against each other.\n\nDarkhold remained empty until [[Othlong Blackhelm]], also known as the \"Robber Lord\", made the keep his home. [[Angarn Surfyst]] slew Othlong via treachery and used the keep as a base for his brigands. Known only to history via his self-proclaimed title, the [[Wolf Knight]] was a follower of Angarn until he slew him and took his place.\n\n[[Sarunn Thoon]], who was best described in the ballad ''[[The Witch of the Far Cold Hill]]'', was originally a captive of the Wolf Knight until she slew him in his bedchamber and took over the helm of the brigands. [[Mind flayer]]s killed Sarunn and held the brigands in service until they died, but the white dragon [[Cryomantipelica]] crushed the mind flayers and laired there until killed by [[Harristor Thunderswing]]. Harristor did not occupy the castle and it fell to a roaming [[beholder]] and a [[leucrotta]] at various times. \n\nBrigands once again took over the castle at some point after that, but they were slain by an adventuring company called the [[Wildmen of the North]] and [[Brundar Tigerbane]] renamed the keep '''Wild Hold''' and refortified it. Brundar and his followers later fell in battle.\n\nOver the next 200 years, the keep was held by a succession of petty rulers known by a variety of names, including the \"Lord Knight of the Far Hills\" and the \"Duke of Sunset Vale\". The Keep of the Far Hills eventually became Darkhold when it was conquered and settled by the [[lich]]-queen [[Varalla]].",
            "Zhentarim Occupation": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the Zhentarim invaded and seized control of Darkhold. It also allowed the mage to keep check on the power of nearby [[Cormyr]], preventing them from taking lands further west. \n\nAfter the Zhentarim temporarily allied with the armies of [[Cormyr]] to turn aside the invading [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]], in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, King [[Azoun IV]] decreed that the [[Purple Dragons]] would abstain from engaging in any conflicts with the forces of Darkhold for one year.\n\nDarkhold was among the Zhent power centers targeted by the [[Church of Cyric]] during the [[Second Banedeath]]. Followers of the Mad God successfully drove out, or otherwise converted, all the followers of [[Bane]] in Darkhold.\n\nAfter [[Fall of Zhentil Keep|Zhentil Keep fell]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Semmemon attempted to maintain order in Darkhold. He began to negotiate a treaty with the [[drow]] of [[Sshamath]], an nearby city in the [[Underdark]].\n\nSememmon proved unsuccessful however. After Bane was resurrected within the [[Faerûnian pantheon]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Darkhold was thrown into chaos. Banes followers, along with those of [[Cyric]], vyed for dominance within the Zhentarim. That same year, Sememmon and his consort Ashemmi vanished from Darkhold completely, largely in response to the consolidation of Zhentarim power in the east by rival Fzoul Chembryl.{{Cite dragon/357/Volo's Guide: Renegades of Darkhold|73}} Sememmon was believed to have left some valued items hidden away in Darkhold upon his departure.\n\nDarkhold's leadership was taken over by the Pereghost, who commanded its 800 warriors, and [[Dhamir Ercals]], who led the resident [[clerics]] of [[Cyric]]. Both leaders were servants of Cyric and began preparing for the inevitable holy war against the Banite. Despite their shared faith, the hatred between them was so intense, they spent more time forming assassination plots, rather than fulfilling their duties as Zhentarim leaders.\n\nOn [[Kythorn 7]] in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, [[Zhentilar]] troops from Darkhold ambushed the caravan of [[Dabron Sashenstar]], but the famed adventurer was able to retreat to [[Hluthvar]].",
            "15{{th}} Century": "Following a series of disasters for the Zhentarim that left both Zhentil Keep and the [[Citadel of the Raven]] destroyed, Darkhold emerged as the only major stronghold of the Black Network still standing. It continued to operate as a Zhent stronghold throughout the 15{{th}} century DR, serving as a barracks and fortress for their mercenary army.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, Darkhold was the primary headquarters of the reformed Zhentarim. The Pereghost was publicly acknowledged as the sole master of Darkhold, though the Beholder [[Manxam]] also appeared to be a member of the stronghold's senior leadership. The Pereghost sought to restore the Zhentarim as a military force to be reckoned with in the west."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Due to its unique structure, some believed that Darkhold was formed by [[elemental]]s summoned by a [[sorcerer]] of ancient [[Netheril]], or was assembled during the [[Dawn Age]] when [[giant]]kind ruled [[Faerûn]]. Yet another rumor stated that the Netherese sorcerer that constructed Darkhold was reborn as a lich, and remained interred within its depths as of the early [[Era of Upheaval]].\n\nThe symbol of Darkhold, a hillside castle set over a lightning bolt, was used in the minting of some [[currency|gold coins]], of unknown origin.",
        "Inhabitants": {
            "Notable Inhabitants": "* [[Asbarode]] and her band of rogues, [[Kolvar]], [[Bauble]], [[Sem]], and [[Slim]] also sometimes operated out of Darkhold.\n* [[Dag Zoreth]], one of Cyric's [[strifeleader]]s.\n* [[Grigarr]], the keep's wyvern-tamer.\n* [[Guin Terabuck]] was a halfling business man who ran his castle-building scheme out of Darkhold. He was watched and protected by a pair of [[ogre mage|ogre mages]] known as \"Guin's Minders\".\n* [[Ilthond]], [[Kadorr]], [[Sashen]], and [[Yarkul]] were all apprentices under Ashemmi's tutelage.\n* [[Iltur]], [[Mairhe]], and [[Sahbonn]], also know as \"[[The Three]]\", were Manshoon's personal assassin's who sometimes worked out of Darkhold.\n* [[Malchior]], a selfish and contemptable [[cleric]] of Cyric."
