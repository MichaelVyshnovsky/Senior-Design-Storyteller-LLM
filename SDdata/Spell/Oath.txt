'''''Oath''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, a shugenja forced an oath between them and an unwilling creature. A shugenja demanded a deed be fulfilled in return for consideration from the shugenja. The creature was required to speak the same language as the shugenja, and the oath had to be within the natural abilities of the creature. The shugenja was also unable to use this spell to demand a task of a creature that would harm it. A common example was a shugenja forcing a bandit to never rob travelers again, and in exchange the shugenja spared their life. Both parties had free will to abide by the agreed conditions. If the shugenja broke their agreement, the spell was broken and the shugenja suffered a loss in honor. However, if the target creature attempted to break their oath, the spell inflicted painful spasms. The reverse of this spell, ''[[unbend]]'', freed the creature from their oath. ''[[Atonement]]'' was also able to free a creature from it's obligations, but ''[[dispel magic]]'' did not.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell and its reverse required the same [[material component]]: the shugenja's holy symbol.
