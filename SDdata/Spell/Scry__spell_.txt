'''''Scry''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
A wu jen cast this spell to [[scry]] events in an area. The spell formed a mirror-like surface. This surface was unaffected by any disturbances. The wu jen then concentrated on the mirror to hear or see an event within the range of the spell. The wu jen was provided with a crisp clear image or sound. The scrying was one-way, and a spell could not be cast through the mirror. The spell could not penetrate lead or gold, nor magical protections already in place.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]. The wu jen required an element to cast this spell, such as smooth stone or a silent grove of trees.
