        "mainbody": "Plant renewal was an alteration spell that healed and purified any living plant.\nWhen cast, this spell completely rejuvenated any single plant. It destroyed any predatory insects, mold, fungi or other harmful lifeforms caused fruit to bloom and flowers to blossom and dispelled any illusory effects.\nThis spell could not be used to bring dead plants back to a state of living.\nThe specifications of this spell were inscribed upon the Eldathyn relic, the Crystrum of Tranquility.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a single drop of rain, or dew that was collected on a night when the moon was in view."
