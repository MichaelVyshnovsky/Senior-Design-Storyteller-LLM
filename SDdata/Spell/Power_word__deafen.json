        "mainbody": "Power word, deafen, was a powerful spell from the enchantment school that could be wielded by both sorcerers and wizards.\nAfter the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, the spell was able to deafen a creature permanently or temporarily. The length of the effect was dependent on the targets health. The weaker the creature, the greater the risk of it being deafened permanently. \nThe spell only worked on creatures, under a certain average degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the spellcaster.\nThe spell required only a verbal component, which was the uttering of the power word itself.\nThe spell could be wielded by both sorcerers and wizards."
