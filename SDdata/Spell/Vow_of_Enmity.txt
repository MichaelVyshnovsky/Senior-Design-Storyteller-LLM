The '''''Vow of Enmity''''', also called an '''''oath of enmity''''', was a ''[[channel divinity]]'' power granted to [[avenger]]s, [[paladin]]s who had sworn an [[Oath of Vengeance]].

==Effects==
A ''Vow of Enmity'' was a [[divine|divine]]ly granted power to strike down a chosen foe. The avenger uttered a spiteful prayer against a foe, which granted them extraordinary accuracy in their attacks against it. While any paladin who had sworn an Oath of Vengeance gained this power, those avengers who had been formally trained by their secret orders could use a version of it with much greater reach. Vengeance-bound paladins who gained great power came to be known as a Soul of Vengeance, and could quickly strike to punish the targets of their ''Vow'' if they tried to attack in combat. 

In addition, some avengers trained in special tactics and prayers that were more devastating against the targets of their ''oaths of enmity''. At the most basic level, this included training in the ways of using divine power to censure their targets:

===Pursuit===
The '''Censure of Pursuit''' granted the avenger divine quickness to strike at the target of their ''oath of enmity'' if it attempted to flee from them. This form of censure was favored by so-called [[pursuing avenger]]s.

===Retribution===
The '''Censure of Retribution''' involved the use of cruel cunning, and allowed the avenger to strike at the target of their ''oath of enmity'' with greater ferocity whenever the target's allies tried to assist it in the fight. This form of censure was favored by so-called [[isolating avenger]]s.

===Unity===
The '''Censure of Unity''' drew upon the aid of allies, and granted the avenger greater strength for every friend assisting them in melee against the target of their ''oath of enmity''. This form of censure was favored by so-called [[commanding avenger]]s.
