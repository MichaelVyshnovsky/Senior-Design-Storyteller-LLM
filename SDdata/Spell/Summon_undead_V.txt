Summon undead V, also known as undead summoning V, was the most powerful of the series of summon undead spells available to arcane casters in the Realms.
This spell could summon a mummy, a shadow, a vampire spawn or a wight. As an alternative, the spell could summon one to three allips or ghasts, two to five ghouls, two to five huge, large, or medium-sized skeletons, or two to five large, medium-sized, or small zombies&mdashprovided they were all within 30 feet of each other. 
If ghasts, ghouls, or shadows were summoned, the spell was considered a chaotic spell in addition to an evil one. If a mummy or wight was summoned, it was a lawful spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a piece of bone from either a lich, mummy or vampire.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
