        "mainbody": "Spider summoning was a spell used by priestesses of Lolth. \nWhen cast, this spell summoned several large spiders around the caster. The number of spiders was determined by the casters spell level. They appeared out of thin air within  of the caster. Utterly loyal to the caster, they obeyed the casters mental commands and fought to the death if necessary. \nWhile the spell was in effect, the caster was free to cast other spells. Once the spell expired, the spiders vanished, returning to where they were summoned from. The spell was only able to summon natural arachnids. It was unable to summon spider-like creatures nor creatures who used magic to take the form of a spider. It also could only control the spiders that were summoned by the spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a dehydrated spider."
