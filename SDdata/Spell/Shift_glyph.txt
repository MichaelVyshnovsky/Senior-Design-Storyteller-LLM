'''''Shift gyph''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Deneir]], enabling them to move the position of a glyph.

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to permanently move the position of a previously cast rune, glyph, magical inscription, or ''[[symbol]]''. The allowable distance that the glyph could be move depended on the skill of the caster. Once cast, the spell would illuminate all suitable glyphs within range, allowing the caster to select a single glyph as a target. Any other glyphs within range would cease to glow once the caster selected a target glyph. Once a glyph was selected the caster needed to resist the glyph, otherwise it would trigger and they would suffer any applicable consequences.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
