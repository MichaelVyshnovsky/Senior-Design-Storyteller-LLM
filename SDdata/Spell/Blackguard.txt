Blackguards, also referred to as antipaladins, were the quintessential champions of evil in Faer√ªn. They led armies of dread forces such as undead, fiends, and other extra-planar beings, often in the name of the more malevolent deities.
These individuals had the reputation as some of most reviled villains. They were just as equally feared as they were despised by the free folk of the Realms. They acted as killers, led as commanders, and even served as agents for more forces that were even more malignant than they.
They accomplished their goals by any means necessary, whether through subterfuge, dark magic, anarchic destruction, or overwhelming force.
Blackguards possessed a distinct auras of evil and despair, carrying blessings bestowed upon them by the forces of darkness.
They were quite adept at readily uncovering good beings, and once per day, could smite them in battle. Blackguards could carry out smiting more often as the longer they carried out their dark deeds.
The more venerated blackguards could turn away and take control of undead creatures they encountered.
Among those individuals that ventured down the road of the blackguard were many who forewent more altruistic paths. It was not uncommon for fallen paladins and disgraced rangers to seek out a new life as one of these black knights.
Due to their proficiency with shadow magic, Blackguards were often found in the service of the deity Shar.
