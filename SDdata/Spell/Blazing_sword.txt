Blazing sword was a spell used by clerics of Arvoreen.
When cast, this casters melee weapon, often a sword, began to glow with a sparkling silvery light. The spell increased the damage inflicted by the sword. When the spell expired, the sword was usually ruined. This spell was a stronger version of sparkling sword.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a small amount of sulfur. The sulfur was tossed onto the weapon during casting.
