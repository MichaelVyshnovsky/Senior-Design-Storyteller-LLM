Net was an evocation spell that created a heavy and adherent net that entangled any person or creature caught within. It was considered a lesser version of the spell web.
It was designed specifically for the members of the City Watch of Waterdeep.
When this spell was a cast, a heavy and sticky net, which somewhat resembled a spiders web, appeared over a 10 (2.9 m) area. While it was possible for anyone caught within the area to dodge out of the way, if they failed to act quickly enough they were immobilized for a matter of moments.
This spell could be cast so that the net appeared in the air and dropped on top of people below, or used to ensnare aerial creatures. Compared to web, it was much more useful in cities as it was less-likely to harm bystanders or other passersby.
The netting created by this spell was not flammable, however it could be cut away in order for someone to free themself. Because of this, a number of nets were often cast in conjunction with one another to douse small flames.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small bit of spider web or rope.
