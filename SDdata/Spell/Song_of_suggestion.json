        "mainbody": "'''''Song of suggestion''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] [[spell]] used by [[Tuneservant]]s, enabling them to compel a subject to follow the caster's orders if they could understand the caster's spoken language.",
        "Effects": "With this spell the caster influenced the subject through verbal suggestions. In order to work properly, the suggestion needed to be worded so the subject believed the suggestion was reasonable. For example, the spell would fail if the caster asked the target to stab or immolate itself.\n\nThe caster could issue new suggestions for the duration of the spell. However, the spell ended when the subject completed any suggestion. The suggestion went unfulfilled if the spell ended and the subject had not completed their task."
