        "mainbody": "'''Goblins''' were a race of small and numerous [[goblinoid]]s common throughout [[Toril]], often living in underground caverns near the surface known as lairs. The race was often, though not always, dominated by other goblinoids, most commonly [[hobgoblin]]s. Goblins may have, in fact, been initially created by this related race to serve as scouts and infiltrators.",
        "Description": "{{Quote|Sez here that 'goblinoids are obstreperous and malodorous...|Booyagh [[Piddle]], reading from ''[[On Goblins: My Life Among the Conquering Host]].''}}\n\nGoblins usually stood between {{SIrange|3'4\"|3'8\"|ft-in}} and weighed about {{SIrange|40|55|lbs|k}} on average. They had flat faces, sloped back forehead, broad noses, pointed ears, and small, sharp fangs. and their eyes varied in color from red to yellow. Their skin color ranged from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red, though they also came in shades of green. All members of the same tribe normally shared the same skin color \n\nGoblins typically dressed in dark [[leather armor|leathers]] soiled by poor hygiene and colored in a similar range of tones to their skin.",
        "Personality": "Like other goblinoids, goblins often had a short temper, and were more easily provoked than individuals of most other races. They often found it difficult to overcome this short fuse, and had a sense of greed that made it difficult for them to act altruistically. They also generally took sadistic pleasure in exacting revenge once crossed.\n\nYoung goblins were taught from an early age to rely only on themselves, and that to survive, they needed to be aggressive and ruthless. To a goblin, it didn't seem logical to treat others as well or better than you would treat yourself; rather, they believed in preemptively removing potential rivals before they could become a threat. Expatriated goblins would sometimes try to recreate the circumstances of their culture, preying on the weaknesses of others in non-goblin communities.\n\nDespite their generally poor reputation however, not all goblins were dim-witted or evil. Some goblins have risen to become heroes, gaining enough renown to be accepted into the civilized world of other, more commonly good races. Those goblins seeking this path may have found it difficult to overcome their temper and greed, as well as the cultural influence of their brethren, but those who did often found it could be more rewarding, in the long run at least, to serve good rather than to serve evil. Those that did often made use of their ill-gained talents as [[rogue]]s or [[fighter]]s.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Battle_Cry_Goblin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''A fearsome goblin letting loose his battle cry.'']]\nBeing bullied by bigger, stronger creatures had taught goblins to exploit what few advantages they had, namely sheer numbers and malicious ingenuity. They favored ambushes, overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edges they could devise, the concept of a fair fight being meaningless in their society. \n\nGoblins were an elusive and nimble race, which enabled them to slip away from danger more easily than most. In combat, goblins often used this advantage to sneak up on enemies and deal them a blow from hiding and then slip away before they could be retaliated against.\n\nWhen they had superior numbers in battle, goblins would attempt to flank lone combatants. Retreat or surrender was their general response to being outmatched.\n\nGoblins were often known to fight with [[military pick]]s, [[morningstar]]s, [[short sword]]s, [[sling]]s, and [[spear]]s.",
        "Society": {
            "Homelands": "Goblins often inhabitated temperate plains, though many were also known to live in caverns or underground.",
            "Languages": "Besides the [[Ghukliak]], some goblins were known to be capable of speaking [[Orcish]] or [[Yipyak]].",
            "Religion": "Goblins primarily worshiped members of the [[goblinoid pantheon]], such as [[Maglubiyet]] in particular, who inspired them with his feats of strength and treachery. Following the [[Spellplague]] and prior to the [[Second Sundering]], however, the power of the Black Lord [[Bane]] grew and extended his power over Maglubiyet, making the goblin god one of his [[exarch]]s. Following the Second Sundering, goblins again worshiped deities such as Maglubiyet and [[Khurgorbaeyag]].",
            "Relationships": "Goblins were often considered little more than a nuisance. They did not get along well with most other races and were particularly suspicious of other goblinoids. Goblins had a somewhat ambivalent relationship with [[orc]]s and [[half-orc]]s, whom they'd work with on occasion, but the only true allies of the goblin race were [[worg]]s, who often acted as mounts and fighting companions for goblins. \n\nGoblins had particularly adverse relations with [[dwarves]], [[gnomes]], and [[Tel-quessir]].\n\nSome were known to domesticate huge wolves."
