        "mainbody": "Graft flesh was a necromancy spell that allowed the caster to connect flesh onto a living humanoid recipient.\nThe recipient of graft flesh had complete control over whatever flesh or body part was grafted to them as it literally became an extension of their body. However, the graft would radiate a faint aura of necromancy and might quickly deaden and fall off depending on the source of the flesh and the skill of the caster.\nThe spell had two main uses. The first use was to restore or replace a missing limb by grafting musculo-skeletal tissue onto the site of the lost limb. If the lost limb itself was available, it could be permanently reattached. If not, a limb could be harvested from a fresh corpse, however this would rot and fall off after several days.\nThe second use was to disguise the caster or another person using the flesh and skin of a fresh corpse. The recipients face and body could be made to appear like that of the corpse, however this process had no effect on their voice, knowledge, physical strength, or sensory abilities. This disguise could last for several days before it deadened and dropped away.\nThe spell had both verbal and somatic components.\nSome staves of skulls could be used to cast graft flesh.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the \"Lady Doctor\" Ellandra Tolbert made use of graft flesh to conceal her burned and scarred face."
