Create baneguard was a divine magic spell available to clerics of Bane, the Black Hand. It animated a baneguard out of an intact skeleton. but this spell was specific to Bane and did not spread to other faiths until after his "death" in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR.
This spell took less than a minute to cast and the cleric had to touch the skeleton that was to be animated. Upon completion, the skeletal form rose, ready to attack.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components an intact skeleton of approximately human size or smaller, and 20 drops of blood from a true dragon.
This spell was originally developed by priests of Bane, the Lord of Darkness. Eventually other evil- and neutral-aligned faiths learned this spell or a variant of it, and it was often called just create undead.
