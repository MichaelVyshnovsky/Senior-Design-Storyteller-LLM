'''''Create baneguard''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to [[cleric]]s of [[Bane]], the Black Hand. It animated a [[baneguard]] out of an intact skeleton. but this spell was specific to Bane and did not spread to other faiths until after his "death" in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]].

==Effects==
This spell took less than a minute to cast and the cleric had to touch the skeleton that was to be animated. Upon completion, the skeletal form rose, ready to attack.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s an intact skeleton of approximately [[human]] size or smaller, and 20 drops of blood from a true [[dragon]].

==History==
This spell was originally developed by priests of [[Bane]], the Lord of Darkness. Eventually other evil- and neutral-aligned faiths learned this spell or a variant of it, and it was often called just ''[[create undead]]''.
