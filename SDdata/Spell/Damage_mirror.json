        "mainbody": "Damage mirror was a very rare alteration spell of the southern magic tradition.\nWhen cast, damage inflicted on the caster was mirrored to any creature within a  radius. The spell expired after it has been triggered, so only the first attack would have the mirroring effect. The spell was not affected by spells or magical attacks, but dispel magic could cancel the spell after it has been cast. If the caster was killed or immobilized during the triggering attack, then the attacker was also killed or immobilized. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, crushed glass from a broken mirror."
