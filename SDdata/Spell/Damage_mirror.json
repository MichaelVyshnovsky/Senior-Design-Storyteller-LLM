        "mainbody": "'''''Damage mirror''''' was a very rare [[alteration]] spell of the [[southern magic]] tradition{{Southernmagic}}.",
        "Effects": "When cast, damage inflicted on the caster was mirrored to any creature within a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} radius. The spell expired after it has been triggered, so only the first attack would have the mirroring effect. The spell was not affected by spells or magical attacks, but ''[[dispel magic]]'' could cancel the spell after it has been cast. If the caster was killed or immobilized during the triggering attack, then the attacker was also killed or immobilized.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], crushed glass from a broken [[mirror]]."
