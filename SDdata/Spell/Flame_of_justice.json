        "mainbody": "Flame of justice was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell was a more powerful version of the fire truth spell and was cast in the same manner using a special lit candle.\nWhen the target of this spell spoke falsely, part of their body would burst into flame.\nFor this spell, the idea of truth is based on the casters ideal, not the targets. If something is incorrect yet the caster believed it to be the truth, then the target would suffer accordingly if they \"lied.\"\nThis spell expired after ten questions were asked.\nThis spell required a candle made from a rare form of desert bees wax to cast."
