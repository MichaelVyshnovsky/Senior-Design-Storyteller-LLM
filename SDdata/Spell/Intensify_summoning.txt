Intensify summoning was a conjuration and necromancy spell that was used by wizards.
This spell affected the first two conjuration spells used by the caster within ten minutes of casting, enhancing the strength of the casters summoned creatures. It could be used on beginner to intermediate conjuration spells.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small leather pouch and miniature silver candelabra to cast.
