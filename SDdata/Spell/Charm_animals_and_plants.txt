Charm animals and plants was a divine spell or channel divinity given to clerics who chose the Nature domain.
This spell had a chance to charm all animals and plant creatures in a 30 ft (9.1 m) radius for one minute. The creatures had one chance to resist the spell or be rendered friendly to the caster and anyone the caster declared a friend. The creatures had to be able to see the caster or they were unaffected.
Only the casters holy symbol was needed to cast this spell, and for the priest to invoke his or her deitys name.
