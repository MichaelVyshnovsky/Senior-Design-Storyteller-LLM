'''''Spiderskin''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that hardened the recipient's skin.

==Effects==
On casting ''spiderskin'' and touching the target, the target's skin was enshrouded in a yellow light that disappeared after a short time. The skin was then hardened like a carapace. The specialty about this spell was that it could be used to harden already hard and tough skin as long as the original skin toughness did not originate from [[magic]]. The degree to which the skin hardened increased with the caster's skill.

==Components==
''Spiderskin'' required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s in the form of a [[spider]] leg piece when it was cast as an arcane spell. Divine spellcasters needed to substitute the material component with a [[divine focus]].

==History==
The ''[[rod of webspinning]]'' required the casting of a ''spiderskin'' spell alongside a ''[[freedom of movement]]'' and ''[[web]]'' spell. A ''[[staff of spider]]'' required the casting of the spell alongside a ''[[spider climb]]'' and a ''[[summon swarm]]'' spell to craft.
