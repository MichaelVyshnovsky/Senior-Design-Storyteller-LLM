Pass without trace was a transmutation or enchantment spell that allowed the recipients to move through an area leaving no footprints or scent.
The caster had to touch the creature(s) to cast this spell. Once activated, the subject could pass (on foot) through any type of terrain including mud, snow, sand, dust, etc. and leave no sign or scent behind that could be tracked by normal, non-magical means.
The transmutation version lasted longer and left no magical signature behind. The enchantment version actually enchanted the path taken by the recipients and radiated a dweomer for up to an hour afterward.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the enchantment version of pass without trace required that a sprig of pine or evergreen be burned and the ashes crushed to a powder and spread about. The transmutation version only required the casters holy symbol or divine focus as the material component.
