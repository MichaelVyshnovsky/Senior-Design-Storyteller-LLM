'''''Pass without trace''''' was a [[transmutation]] or [[enchantment]] spell that allowed the recipients to move through an area leaving no footprints or scent.

==Effects==
The caster had to touch the creature(s) to cast this spell. Once activated, the subject could pass (on foot) through any type of terrain including mud, snow, [[sand]], dust, etc. and leave no sign or scent behind that could be tracked by normal, non-magical means.

The transmutation version lasted longer and left no magical signature behind. The enchantment version actually enchanted the path taken by the recipients and radiated a dweomer for up to an hour afterward.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the enchantment version of ''pass without trace'' required that a sprig of pine or evergreen be burned and the ashes crushed to a powder and spread about. The transmutation version only required the caster's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]] as the material component.
