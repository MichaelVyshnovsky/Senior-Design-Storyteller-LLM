        "mainbody": "Stonebirds was a divine spell used by clerics of Ilmater and by avenging spirits.\nWhen cast, this spell summoned a flock of up to twenty birds, who were then transformed into living stone. Despite being made from stone, the birds retained their normal avian qualities, including the power of flight. The flock was under the command of the caster, and could be directed to peck at foes, inflicting injury, or even fly into targets, but they died on impact.\nThe birds remained as living stone for ten minutes, or until they were killed. Once this spell expired, the birds were transformed back to normal and no longer under the command of the caster.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components.\n* Sigfrieda, a.k.a. Sunshine, the avenging spirit of Crystal Spring, north of Ravens Bluff"
