Undead form was a divine alteration and necromancy spell from the necromantic sphere that allowed the caster to assume the form and abilities of a type of undead.
The caster was unable to cast any spells while in undead form. The spell lasted for several minutes depending on the skill of the caster.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a small piece of bone or flesh from the body of the undead being to cast.
Undead form was granted to priests of Velsharoon, the Lich Lord.
