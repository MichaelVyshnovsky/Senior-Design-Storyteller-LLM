        "mainbody": "Alter reality was an arcane illusion spell that could temporarily make changes in reality that suited the caster.\nThe caster envisioned the change they wanted to happen during the spells casting. They did this by speaking it aloud and casting a phantasmal force version of the change. Typically, only minor changes could be affected without dire consequences. Alter reality was a double-edged sword, with casters trying to change too much often seeing the spell backfire upon them.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component part of the casters life force as casting this spell aged the caster slightly.\nThe alter reality spell could be used to destroy the rod of mirrors."
