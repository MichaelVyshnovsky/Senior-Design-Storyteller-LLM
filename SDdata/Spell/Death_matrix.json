        "mainbody": "Death matrix was a powerful spell that weaved an intricate and potent pattern of magical energy into the life force of a dragon.\nWhen cast, the spell became an indiscernible part of the dragons being, impervious to detection or negation by any means except with wish. The spell remained dormant until triggered, growing in strength as the dragon aged, fueled by its connection to the dragons life force.\nUpon the dragons demise, the spell was activated, unleashing a cataclysmic event. The dragons lifeless body erupted in a colossal explosion, scattering gem-encrusted scales, muscles, bones, claws, fangs, innards, and blood within a -radius sphere. The explosion also harnessed the unbridled power of the dragons breath weapon. Since the explosion encompassed not only the dragons breath weapon but also the propelled body parts and concussive force, immunity to the dragons breath weapon alone did not grant immunity to damage.\nOnly a full wish spell possessed the power to remove a death matrix. Alternatively, the sole means of preventing the triggering of a death matrix was the instantaneous annihilation of the dragon. Spells such as disintegrate or magical items like a sphere of annihilation were necessary to utterly and instantly eradicate the dragon. Without the dragons corpse or any remaining fragments, the death matrix became impotent and dissipated harmlessly as a wave of magical energy, causing a tingling sensation noticeable to creatures within the radius. This energy could not be absorbed, harnessed, or manipulated in any way. However, if even a single scale or fragment of the dragon remained, the death matrix was still activated upon its demise. In cases where only a fraction of the dragons body remained, the inflicted damage was considerably reduced.\nThe ability to cast death matrix was beyond the reach of most dragons, regardless of their age or species. Consequently, dragons often relied on scrolls containing the spell to establish a death matrix.\nThis spell only required a verbal component."
