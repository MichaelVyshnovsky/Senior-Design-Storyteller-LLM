        "mainbody": "'''''Death matrix''''' was a powerful [[spell]] that weaved an intricate and potent pattern of magical energy into the life force of a [[dragon]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell became an indiscernible part of the dragon's being, impervious to detection or negation by any means except with ''[[wish]]''. The spell remained dormant until triggered, growing in strength as the dragon aged, fueled by its connection to the dragon's life force.\n\nUpon the dragon's demise, the spell was activated, unleashing a cataclysmic event. The dragon's lifeless body erupted in a colossal explosion, scattering gem-encrusted scales, muscles, bones, claws, fangs, innards, and blood within a {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}}-radius sphere. The explosion also harnessed the unbridled power of the dragon's breath weapon. Since the explosion encompassed not only the dragon's breath weapon but also the propelled body parts and concussive force, immunity to the dragon's breath weapon alone did not grant immunity to damage.\n\nOnly a full ''wish'' spell possessed the power to remove a ''death matrix''. Alternatively, the sole means of preventing the triggering of a ''death matrix'' was the instantaneous annihilation of the dragon. Spells such as ''[[disintegrate]]'' or magical items like a ''[[sphere of annihilation]]'' were necessary to utterly and instantly eradicate the dragon. Without the dragon's corpse or any remaining fragments, the ''death matrix'' became impotent and dissipated harmlessly as a wave of magical energy, causing a tingling sensation noticeable to creatures within the radius. This energy could not be absorbed, harnessed, or manipulated in any way. However, if even a single scale or fragment of the dragon remained, the ''death matrix'' was still activated upon its demise. In cases where only a fraction of the dragon's body remained, the inflicted damage was considerably reduced.\n\nThe ability to cast ''death matrix'' was beyond the reach of most dragons, regardless of their age or species. Consequently, dragons often relied on scrolls containing the spell to establish a ''death matrix''.",
        "Components": "This spell only required a [[verbal component]]."
