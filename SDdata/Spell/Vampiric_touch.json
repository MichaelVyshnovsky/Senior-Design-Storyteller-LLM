        "mainbody": "Vampiric touch was a necromancy spell that absorbed the life force of a living creature to heal the caster.\nIf the caster managed to hit and establish contact with another creature, the spell started siphoning life from the target and healing the caster. The ability to perform this life drain continued active for up to one minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Gwynn in  and was originally known as Gwynns vampirism."
