        "mainbody": "Investiture of ice was a transmutation spell that covered the caster in protective rime ice that could also be used as a form of attack.\nThe spell covered the casters body in ice crystals that lasted for 10 minutes, as long as the caster kept concentrating. The ice rendered the caster immune to all forms of cold and conferred magical resistance to fire, as well as allowing for easy movement across icy surfaces. The ice also froze the area around the caster, rendering the terrain slippery and treacherous for other nearby creatures. The spell could shoot out at the casters command as a cone of cold air that reached as far as , freezing and slowing down all creatures within its volume.\nThe spell only required verbal and somatic components."
