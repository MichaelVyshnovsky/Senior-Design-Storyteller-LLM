Knights puissance was a minor utterance from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind that used truespeak to grant a target the ability to strike true in melee, or hamper it, if reversed.
In its straight form, it granted a tangible boost to the targets ability to strike true in melee. Its reversed form constantly pushed it off balance, hampering its efforts. Both lasted for roughly half a minute.
The utterance was known to loquasphinxes.
