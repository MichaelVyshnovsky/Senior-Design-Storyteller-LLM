Dragonblood spell-pact was a spell that was used by dragons. 
This spell allowed two dragons or draconic creature to trade a known spell. While the spells that are to be traded must be of the same level, they did not have to be in the same school. A caster could not use this spell to learn more spells then permitted by their skill level and once a spell was traded, it must be re-learned. This spell could only be cast by dragons or other draconic creatures. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component. Each caster had to partake in a blood ceremony, with the drawn blood to be used as the material component.
