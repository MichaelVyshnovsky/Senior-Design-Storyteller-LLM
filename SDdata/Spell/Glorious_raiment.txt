Glorious raiment was a divine abjuration spell that imbued clothing with divine power.
A robe, priestly vestments, or even ordinary clothes thus imbued granted a blessed protection against attacks and reduced injuries made by weapons, except from those of evil nature. Although anyone could wear these blessed clothes, only good beings got this protection.
It required verbal and somatic components and a divine focus. As well as a set of clothes, of course.
