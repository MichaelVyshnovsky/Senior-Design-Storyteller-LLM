Iron bones was a spell used by clerics, sorcerers and wizards.
When cast, the spell transformed the bones of an undead creature into iron. The spell also worked on undead creatures that had an exoskeleton.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a focus in the form of a small skull of iron or steel.
