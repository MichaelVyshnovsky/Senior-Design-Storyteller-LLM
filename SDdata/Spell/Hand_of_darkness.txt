Hand of darkness was an arcane spell used by the drow designed to negate light.
Upon casting, hand of darkness deprived light sources within 30 feet (9.1 meters) of a designated spot of their ability to emit light. For example, if the light source happened to be a torch, the torch stopped shedding light under the spell, but continued to emit heat and burn its fuel.
Light sources brought into the area under a hand of darkness spell, for example by conjuring it up with a light or similar spell, or by more mundane means, were instantly negated.
The spell could be prematurely ended with dispel magic. However, the abjuration would also dispel any magical light source in the area. In the case of continual magical light sources, such as a glowing magical sword, the dispel magic would only temporarily suppress the light-shedding effect.
Hand of darkness required somatic and verbal components, and material components in the form of a lump of coal or handful of ash, a small black glass or stone sphere, and a scrap of black cloth, fur, or hide.
Strong light was uncomfortable for drow and inhibited their ability to concentrate. Hand of darkness was used to combat this problem as it shut out light but not their ability to use infravision.
