        "mainbody": "Sprites was an elven wizard spell from the school of conjuration that summoned a group of sprites.\nWhen cast this spell instantly summoned 2â€“20 sprites. It remained unclear where the sprites were summoned from, as the sprite community swore they were not teleported away from their homes. Many believed the sprites were the spirits of sprite warriors who perished while serving the elves in the past.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a piece of sprite clothing and a small silver bell to cast.\nThe origins of this spell resulted from an ancient pact made between elves and sprites."
