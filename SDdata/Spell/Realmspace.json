The other two vertices were in the location of [[Greyspace]], where the world of [[Oerth]] was found, and [[Krynnspace]], home of the world of [[Krynn]]. The phlogiston had a strong current that flowed between Realmspace and Greyspace, making two-way travel between the two crystal spheres relatively fast and simple. There were one-way flows from Greyspace to Krynnspace and from Krynnspace to Realmspace, but not in the opposite directions. Due to this current, it was impossible to travel directly from Realmspace to Krynnspace and from Krynnspace to Greyspace. For that reason, traveling from Realmspace to Krynnspace was easier if one went through Greyspace first instead of going directly.<ref name=\"AiS.CAS2e-p10-11,86,88>\n\nA close neighbor of Realmspace was [[Refuge (crystal sphere)|Refuge]], a small crystal sphere that contained a spaceport controlled by the Arcane.{{Cite dragon/159/Rough Times on Refuge|10-14}} Refuge itself was a vertex in another stable configuration of the flow, known as the [[Arcane Inner Flow]], which contained the crystal spheres of [[Pirtelspace]] and the [[elf|elven]]-controlled sphere of [[Darnannon]].{{Cite dungeon/36/The Sea of Sorrow|40-45}}",
        "History": "The [[wildspace]] of the Realmspace crystal sphere was unusually warm compared to others. This led sages to speculate that the sun and Realmspace itself were the oldest among the generally known crystal spheres.\n\nIt was believed that the [[creator race]]s from Toril were the earliest intelligent inhabitants of Realmspace, and the first to develop the magical means necessary to travel to other crystal spheres and other planes, around the same time when inhabitants of other spheres also started to travel. These early migrations into Realmspace dated from the apex of the [[dragon|draconic]] domain over Toril. The first to arrive were [[dwarves]], followed by [[treant]]s, [[elves]], and, lastly, [[mind flayer]]s.\n\nA second wave of migration, roughly coinciding with the time primitive [[human]]s started to develop their civilization and with the establishment of [[Ostoria]], heralded the arrival of [[halfling]]s, [[gnome]]s, [[merfolk]], [[giant-kin]], [[titan]]s, and [[triton]]s, as well as―unbeknownst to other races―[[sharn]] and [[phaerimm]].\n\nCenturies later, around the time of the apex of Ostoria, a third wave of direct migrations from other crystal spheres saw the arrival of [[beholder]]s, [[lesser dragon]]s, [[leucrotta]], [[centaur]]s, [[satyr]]s, and [[wemic]]s, among others.\n\nThe last wave of migrations, estimated to have happened around the time humans learned magic from the elves, laying the foundations of what would later become [[Netheril]], saw the arrival of [[pegasi]] and other winged [[humanoid]] races.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]], the chanting of the Wanderers had temporarily ceased due to the fall of Realmspace's powers. For the duration of this period, no portals could be opened through the crystal sphere.\n\nTravelers in Realmspace were sometimes terrorized by a mysterious and intimidating bat-shaped vessel known as the ''[[Batship]]'', an invasive presence that originated in a remote crystal sphere and adopted Realmspace as its hunting grounds."
