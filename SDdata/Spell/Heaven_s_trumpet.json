        "mainbody": "'''''Heaven's trumpet''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that sounded music that could paralyze a [[celestial archon]]'s enemies.",
        "Users": "This spell could be cast only by archons who were [[bard]]s, [[cleric]]s, or [[Emissary of Barachiel|emissaries of Barachiel]].",
        "Effect": "The caster emitted a blast of music of such perfect beauty and clarity it struck those who heard with awe. Enemies up to 120 feet (36 meters) who not withstand it could be paralyzed for up to 24 seconds.",
        "Components": "It required a [[somatic component]], the caster's own archon nature, and a focus in the form of a well-made trumpet, which was blown during casting."
