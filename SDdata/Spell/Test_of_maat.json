        "mainbody": "Test of maat was a divine divination spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Horus-Re called Sunhawks.\nThis spell detected forms of injustice, dishonor, or disorder within a corridor  wide and  long. The spell accomplished this by determining if creatures within the area of effect were in accordance with the concept of maatâ€“a state of living a happy life and being at peace with the gods. Any offenses against Horus-Re were detected by the spell. If multiple people were within the area of effect then a novice Sunhawk would not be able to determine their individual readings. Intermediate or higher-ranking Sunhawks could focus on individual readings if they paused to concentrate.\nAlternatively, test of maat could be used to perceive if a morally ambiguous action fell within the stricture of maat. During the casting the Sunhawk would imagine a course of action taken by themselves or their companions, and the spell would signify whether or not the proposed action would violate the limits of maat.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the Sunhawks holy symbol to cast. The holy symbol was held over their left eye with their right hand during casting."
