'''''Protection from arrows''''', also known as '''''protection from normal missiles''''' and originally called '''''M'dhal's missile shield''''', was a simple [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that defended against ranged weapon attacks.

==Effects==
Upon casting the spell and touching another creature, the caster bestowed a protective shield upon the recipient. This shielding abjuration protected from damage against all but the most powerful strikes by ranged missile weapons, such as arrows, bolts, or stones. It only defended against mundane projectiles; magical projectiles of any sort bypassed this protection. The amount of damage the spell could absorb before being discharged depended on the power of the caster.

The spell's protection would last for at least three hours or longer for more powerful casters.

==Components==
To successfully create the shield, one had to hold onto a piece of tortoise or turtle shell while employing both [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.

On the [[Malatran Plateau]], both [[arcane]] and [[divine]] magics were harnessed using ''[[spell fetish]]es''. '' protection from arrows arcane spell fetish'' was a blunt arrowhead.{{Cite organized play/LJ/An Army of One Thousand|16}}

==History==
The spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[M'dhal]] in {{Yearlink|-927}}.
