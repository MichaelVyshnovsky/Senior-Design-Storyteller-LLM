Rising rot was a divine necromancy and evocation spell used by priests devoted to Moander, enabling them to infects others with rot.
This spell shot a beam of brown energy from the casters palm to a target, infecting them with mold that sucked moisture and nutrients from their flesh. The mold would continue to infect the target until cured with a cure disease spell or the targets death. This spell had no effect on the undead, incorporeal creatures, or creatures that lacked body tissues.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a handful of mold spores to cast.
