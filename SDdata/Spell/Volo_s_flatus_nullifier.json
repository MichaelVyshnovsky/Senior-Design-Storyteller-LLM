        "mainbody": "'''''Volo's flatus nullifier''''' was a simple air-clearing [[arcane]] [[spell]] created by [[Volothamp Geddarm]], Master Traveler of the [[Realms]], sometime before the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell removed strong smells of any foul gas within {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} from the caster. After being cast, the spell continually cleared the air around the caster for one minute and moved with them. As the spellcaster grew in arcane power the ''Volo's flatus nullifier'' extended its duration. The spell affected such stenches as strong [[perfume]]s, [[skunk]] sprays, flatuses, and other similar aromas.",
        "Components": "''Volo's flatus nullifier'' required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s to be cast."
