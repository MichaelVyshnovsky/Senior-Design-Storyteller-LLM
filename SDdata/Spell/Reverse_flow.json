        "mainbody": "Reverse flow was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the spell allowed a wu jen to change the direction of the current of a body of water. It could change the direction of flow of a river or stream, the direction of ocean currents, and even make a waterfall flow upwards. It was commonly used by ship-based wu jen, who used it to help their vessel to travel against a prevailing current. The spell also worked pumps and drains. Normal flow, the reverse of reverse flow, was used to return a natural or regular flow to water.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components."
