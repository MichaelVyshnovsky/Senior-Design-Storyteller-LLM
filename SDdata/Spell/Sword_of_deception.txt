Sword of deception was a spell used by sorcerers, wizards, and wu jen.
When cast, the spell summoned a hovering iridescent pale-green sword. The sword flew through the air and struck targets on its own. The swords skill was the same as that of a warrior of the same spellcasting level of the caster. While the sword could attack multiple creatures during the spells during, it could only strike a single creature at a time.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components a miniature sword and a pair of loaded die.
