'''''Extension III''''' was an [[alteration]] and [[metamagic]] [[spell]] that increased the time another spell lasted.

==Effects==
This spell was very similar to the less potent ''[[extension I]]'': if cast directly after another spell requiring less magical power, ''extension III'' prolonged that spell to either one and a half or two times its original duration, depending on the affected spell's power.<ref>

==Components==
''Extension I'' required [[verbal component]]s only.

==History==
This spell was created by [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Zwei]] in [[-2559 DR|−2559 DR (1300 NY)]] under the name '''''Zwei's 3rd extension''''' as his last and most powerful invention.<br/>

By the 1360s [[DR]], it was considered uncommon in the magical community in [[Faerûn]],<ref> and also only rarely found in [[Zakhara]].{{AQ-time}}<br/>

It fell out of use{{Speculation}} after the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], when experienced spellcasters developed the talent to modify some aspects of their spells, like [[Extend spell|extending the duration]].<ref group="note">3rd edition introduced [[metamagic]] feats, including "Extend spell". The ''[[extension]]'' spells, however, did not appear after 2nd edition.
