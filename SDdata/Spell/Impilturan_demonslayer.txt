'''Impilturan demonslayers''' were heroes of [[Impiltur]] and hunters of the [[demon]]ic forces that haunted it, especially during the late 15{{Th}} century [[DR]]. Wielding dual weapons, most often two blades, Impilturan demonslayers fearlessly hunted the enemies of Impiltur's people, be they demons or horrific [[plaguechanged]] monsters. To these bold adventurers, demons were little more than more powerful versions of the more common [[beast]]s most [[ranger]]s hunt.

==Abilities==
In order to slay the mighty abominations, which they hunted, Impilturan demonslayers dabbled in the ways of [[arcane magic]], unlike most rangers. In addition to wielding the power of martial training, these warriors used a small number of potent [[spell]]s in order to lay low the defenses of any demon they fought.

Those beginning the path of a demonslayer quickly learned the ways of their foes and the arcane knowledge regarding them. This extra knowledge gave demonslayers a slight edge over the forces of the [[Abyss]], making their attacks more potent. With further training, demonslayers could strip the defenses of a demon away, essentially rendering it mortal against the demonslayer's blades. Once a demonslayer was provoked into a rage, they were even more deadly, particularly against their chosen foes.

In order to fight the demons that plagued Impiltur, demonslayers learned a few spells. ''[[Demonward]]'' was the earliest such spell learned and allowed demonslayers to adapt to their enemies' attacks.  With further training, demonslayers could enchant their weapons to make them cut directly into the very souls of the foes they fought, dealing hot, searing damage to demons and their nearby allies. Not all abilities of the demonslayer were [[magic]]al, however, and even the inexperienced could deal crippling damage through more mundane methods.
