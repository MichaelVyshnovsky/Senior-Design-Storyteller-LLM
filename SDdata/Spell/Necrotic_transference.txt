Necrotic transference was a daily weapon-focused prayer available to clerics during the post-Spellplague era.
When necrotic transference was cast a weapon being wielded by the cleric would temporarily be swathed with shadowy necrotic energy. Any creature struck by the weapon while this prayer was active upon it would suffer from the necrotic energy, having some of their lifeforce drained. That lifeforce would then be transferred as a surge of healing to an ally of the clerics choosing within .
Casting this spell required the cleric to be wielding a weapon.
In the , a party of four Daggerdalesmen adventurers were summoned to the mines of Tethyamar by the Banite priestess Lorin-Aria to kill the Zhent wizard Rezlus and put an end to his plans to conquer Daggerdale and the greater Dalelands region. Among this party of adventurers was a dwarf cleric who knew the prayer necrotic transference.
