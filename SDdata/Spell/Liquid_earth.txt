}}'''''Liquid earth''''' was a [[spell]] used commonly in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
This spell turned a hemisphere of any earth-like substance into a thick fog. Any creature that was not a native of the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] could move through this fog as if moving through water. The spell also allowed creatures passing through the fog to breathe normally. It should be noted that this spell did not create any light, so if cast deep underground, the fog area would be utterly dark unless an additional light source was provided.

The hemisphere created by this spell had a 15 foot (4.5 m) radius. It lasted several hours depending on the skill of the caster.

==Components==
In addition to verbal components, this spell required a bent tube of [[nickel]] that was worth 100 [[gold]] to cast.
