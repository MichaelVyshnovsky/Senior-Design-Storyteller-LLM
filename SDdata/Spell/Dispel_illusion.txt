Dispel illusion was a common spell used by illusionists and wu jen in Kara-Tur.
When cast, the spell instantly dismissed any illusion or phantasm created by another wizard of a different school of magic. If the wizard was a practitioner of the same school as the caster, the spell was identical to the dispel magic spell.
The spell required verbal and somatic components.
