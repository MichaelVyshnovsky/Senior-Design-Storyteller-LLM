        "History": "The origin of humanity was unknown. Although the [[Tel-quessir]] could claim the primal war between [[Corellon]] and [[Gruumsh]] for their heritage and the dwarves claimed to have been forged from the rocks of [[Abeir-Toril]] itself, humans had no unifying creation myth. However, they were certainly an ancient race, having originated since before written records existed and were frequently considered one of the [[creator race]]s, though they weren't known to have actually created any species. More confusing yet was that, while humans indeed were native to Toril, they had been found on other worlds as well, with the [[Mulan]]i standing out as an example of human immigrants to Toril.\n\n[[File:Merrouroboros.jpg|thumb|left|''A map of Merrouroboros c. {{Yearlink|-31500}}, showing the land occupied by humans in the south-west.'']]\nDuring the [[Days of Thunder]] ({{Yearlink|-35000}} to {{Yearlink|-30000}}) on the supercontinent of [[Merrouroboros]], humans were a primitive race, similar to apes. Tribes of humans largely inhabited the land later known as the continent of [[Katashaka]]. They used simple tools, banged rocks together to make fire, and dwelled in caves. According to [[Bazim-Gorag]], a [[batrachi]] (another of the creator races) they hid in caves in fear—he called them \"Meat\".\n\nRegardless of their precise origins, humans were undeniably successful. While hardly the only dominant race of Toril, humans were one of them and the most recent to obtain dominance. In spite of this strength, or perhaps because of it, humanity was an eternally fractured and divided race, broken up into over a dozen ethnic offshoots. It was believed that this was in part because humanity, unlike most other races, did not emerge as a whole but rather in several places at once, thereby resulting in its diversity."
