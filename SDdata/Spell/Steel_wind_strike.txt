'''''Steel wind strike''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that caused a weapon and its wielder to meld with the wind and strike multiple opponents within seconds.

==Effects==
The spell infused the caster's weapon with magic. The caster and the weapon then disappeared, striking up to five different opponents within a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} for considerable damage. The caster and the weapon then reappeared next to one of the opponents that were attacked.

==Components==
The spell required only [[somatic component]]s and a melee [[weapon]] worth at least 1 [[sp]] as a [[material component]].
