Greater shadow conjuration, also known as demi-shadow monsters (or demishadow monsters and demishadow monster), was an illusion spell that created semi-real duplicates of conjuration spells.
This spell was a stronger version of shadow conjuration. It allowed the duplication of stronger spells and was more powerful, even when seen through as an illusion.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Shadow in 3272 NY (âˆ’587 DR) and was originally called Shadows demimonster.
