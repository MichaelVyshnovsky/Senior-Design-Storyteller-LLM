        "mainbody": "'''''Witch bolt''''' was a simple [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] that continuously gave electric shocks to its target.",
        "Effects": "The spell created a beam of blue energy from the caster towards a target creature. If the creature was caught in the beam, a sustained arc of lightning was established between the caster and the target, dealing damage for as long as the caster kept concentrating on maintaining the spell, and for as long as a clear line of sight could be maintained to the target, up to a distance of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material]] components. The material required was a twig from a [[tree]] that had been previously struck by lightning.",
        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], ''witch bolt'' could be found in numerous [[spellbook]]s, such as the one belonging to [[Grum'shar]], a [[half-orc]] apprentice [[wizard]] who worked for the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]."
