        "mainbody": "Dusting the rock was an alteration and elemental earth spell from Zakharas ancient empire of Kadar.\nThis spell gave its victim a magical aura that attracted all kinds of loose dust and earth particles from the surroundings. The accumulated material increasingly impeded the target until it could no longer move until the magic ended or the dirt was washed away with a large amount of liquid.\nIf the victim could shake off the spell in the first place, the dust still caused a short disruptive sneeze.\nNext to verbal and somatic components, dusting the rock required magnetized iron fillings and dry quicksand.\nDusting the rock was a spell used by the geomancers of the Ruined Kingdom of Kadar in eastern Zakhara. It was contained in the Kitab al-Asfr, the spellbook penned by the geomancer Balshareska, shortly before she achieved her goal to become Tisan, greatest (and last) holder of power within Kadar.\nWith the fall of the geomancers and the centuries-long imprisonment of Tisan, the spell was also lost. After her second defeat in 1367 DR, the Kitab al-Asafr and the magic within began circulating again in the Land of Fate."
