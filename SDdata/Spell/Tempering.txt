Tempering was a forge chant that initiated a dwarf as a forge priest.
When chanted by both a forge priest and another dwarf who had mastered blacksmithing to an amazing degree, the second dwarf might, if their ability to endure magic was great enough, become accepted as another forge priest. Those who were accepted as forge priests gained a measure of resistance against fiery attacks those who didnt lost some strength of arm, permanently.
The spell could only be cast in a temple to Moradin. It called for a silver axe, a flawless iron hammer, and a gold anvil, all of which were melted down in the process.
