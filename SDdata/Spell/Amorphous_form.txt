'''''Amorphous form''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that changed the target into a oozy mass, like a pudding or puddle, letting them slip through gaps with ease.

==Users==
''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], an [[arcane]] version of ''amorphous form'' was known to be used by Underdark [[assassin]]s, [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s,

==Effects==
On casting ''amorphous form'', a target being touched by the caster became a puddle-like mass with a fluidity that resembled an [[ooze]]. The target's belongings were also affected. The target lost none of his or her agility and could still move. The new fluid body allowed them to enter narrow spaces as small as {{SI|2|in|c|long=yes}} in width. They also gained the ability to move freely and without having to breathe in [[water]].

While in this form, the target was completely immune to [[poison]], form-changing magic, and stunning effects. The target lacked a discernible anatomy and they were impossible to effectively flank.

The spell had a number of downsides. While under the effect of ''amorphous form'', the target could not attack or cast spells that required any [[Somatic component|somatic]], [[Material component|material]], or [[verbal component]]s or foci.

==Components==
''Amorphous form'' required somatic and material components. If cast as a spell of [[divine magic]], it required a [[divine focus]]. The material component was a pinch of gelatin. On casting the spell, the gelatin was sprayed on the target.

==Items==
A ''[[staff of the Underdark]]'' allowed the casting of ''amorphous form'' among others.
