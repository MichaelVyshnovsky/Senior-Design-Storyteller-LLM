        "mainbody": "Boon of fortune was a divine alteration spell that greatly improved the skill and combat prowess of an individual. It was used by clerics of the deity Tymora.\nWhen cast, the recipient of boon of fortune found themself significantly more talented with weapons they were previously merely proficient. Additionally they became much more successful in other endeavors they undertook.\nThis spell could only be cast upon bipedal mammals that normally lived upon the land.\nThe specifications of this spell were inscribed upon the Flame of the Spirit when it assumed its tablet form.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component of either a four-leaf clover or small piece of amber. The latter component reduced the duration of the spells effects."
