        "mainbody": "'''''Cloud of daggers''''' was a simple [[spell]] learned by some [[wizard]]s. Upon casting the wizards ''cloud of daggers'' conjured a cloud of small, flying [[dagger]]s of force within an area of roughly {{SI|5|ft}} in diameter, within {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} of the caster. These daggers cut to shreds anything in their path, though they were weak enough that more powerful foes may be lightly harmed. The cloud remained in place for only a short while, a brief moment at best, but since the wizard could cast it at-will it could be reformed at any time. If a wizard grew to exceptional power, the dangerous of wading into a ''cloud of daggers'' become twice fold.\n\nThe post-[[Second Sundering|Sundering]] version of the spell was much the same, except if used as a higher spell level it would have been even more powerful. This version also was not restricted to the wizard and could be cast at a range of {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}}.",
