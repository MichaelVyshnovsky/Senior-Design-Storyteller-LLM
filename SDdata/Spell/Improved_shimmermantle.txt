'''''Improved shimmmermantle''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that shielded its caster in an invisible protective aura. It was a more advanced version of ''[[shimmermantle]]''.

==Effects==
The spell was nearly identical to its less-advanced version. The protective aura provided by ''improved shimmermantle'' moved with the caster, and could cause a wide array of both physical and [[magic]]al attacks (such as spells, spell-like abilities, or other harmful magical effects) to miss the caster, including attacks not meant to cause any direct harm. Like its basic version, ''improved shimmermantle'' lasted up to ten minutes, but would expire early once it deflected a certain amount of attacks, the exact amount of which depended on the caster's relative strength in the Art.

Unlike its basic version, ''improved shimmermantle'' was completely invisible and could be cast on other people.

While affected by ''improved shimmermantle'', a caster could still use other spells and magic items as normal. There were two exceptions: ''[[magic missile]]s'' were absorbed by the aura no matter which way they passed, and all lightning magic was negated altogether.

A caster could be affected by other magical protections concurrently with ''improved shimmermantle'', provided these did not negate magic.

==Components==
This spell required only the [[verbal component]] to cast.
