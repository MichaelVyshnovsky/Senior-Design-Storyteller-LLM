        "mainbody": "'''''Transforming tune''''' was an [[alteration]]/[[evocation]] [[spell]] that imbued a person's voice or a [[:category:instruments|musical instrument]] with [[arcane]], spell-like effects.",
        "Casting": "This spell was cast upon an individual's vocal cords or an instrument before it was picked up and played. When the affected person sang, or similarly when a performer began playing the enchanted instrument, a series of spell-like effects accompanied the music. These effects lasted for the duration of the spell, dependent on the power of the caster. It required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to be cast.",
        "Effects": "If the performer of the ''transforming tune'' was familiar with its possible effects, they chose which occurred as well as the recipient. If they were unaware of the possibilities of the spell, the effect closest to their desires at the moment of performance was released. If they had a completely open and neutral mind, the effect was entirely random.\n\nThe spherical area affected by the spell could not be larger than {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} and could not be set more than {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} away from the source of the spell's effects. It did not have to be set on ground level, and could be decreased in size or moved as per the will of the performer.\n\nThe known effects of ''transforming tunes'' were quite varied in power and use. They could break [[lock]]s, [[chain]]s, ''[[wizard lock]]s'' and [[psionic]] controls; ''dispel'' [[charm]]s, ''[[polymorph]]ic'' or [[shapechange|shapechanging]] conditions; unmake yet-to-be triggered spell conditions; and even restore expended spells. In addition, they could ''[[levitate]]'', ''polymorph'', or ''[[remove curse]]s'' from the performer and even grant them ''[[strength]]''. The songs could mimic the effects of certain spells such as ''[[call woodland beings]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[heal]]'', ''[[repulsion]]'', ''[[stone tell]]'', ''[[stone to flesh]]'', ''[[telekinesis]]'', ''[[Tenser's transformation]]'', and ''[[true seeing]]''.\n\nLastly, ''transforming tunes'' could create three effects that were somewhat unique. The song could instantly destroy any effects created by the spells ''[[entangle]]'' and ''[[Evard's black tentacles]]'', whether they had been triggered or not; it could nullify the auditory powers of certain creatures including [[sphinx]]es, [[banshee]]s, and [[shrieker]]s; and it could place a \"weird\" upon a living being, which warned the performer with song when the subject committed a specific action or deed."
