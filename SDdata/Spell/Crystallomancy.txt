'''''Crystallomancy''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell granted to [[priest]]s of [[Corellon]], Ruler of All Elves. It turned an ordinary [[gemstone]] into a [[scrying]] device for a short time.

==Effects==
This spell imbued a clear or translucent crystal or gem with a power similar to a ''[[crystal ball]]''. The caster could scry a distant location for at least one minute, but the more valuable the gemstone, the longer the spell lasted, up to a maximum of one hour. Learned and experienced priests could cast one or more [[divination]] spells of the ''detection'' type (''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', and so on) through the device.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a clear or translucent crystalline gem with a minimum value of 1,000 [[gold piece]]s as a [[material component]]. The gem and holy symbol were not consumed in the casting of the spell.
