Spell reflection was an obscure incantation spell that caused incoming spells to bounce back on their casters. It was known mostly only by flameskulls.This ability of flameskulls was removed in later editions, so counterparts for this spell are unknown.
Spell reflection caused all spells reaching the target to be returned to their caster. If the spell did damage, the caster would suffer it otherwise, the spell was negated.
It required only a verbal component, making it useful for flameskulls.
Spell reflection was lost or long forgotten to most mages, and only remembered by old flameskulls in the midâ€“14 century DR.
* The Lichlord, a lich who sought to avert Karsuss Folly by conquering Netheril, had his clothing enchanted with spell reflection.
