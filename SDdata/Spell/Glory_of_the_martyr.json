Although created by Ilmater, the Crying God, and used by his faithful, the spell spread to paladins of other faiths.\nThe spell could be cast by paladinsâ€”originally only those of Ilmater, but later of other faiths. It could also be cast by champions of Gwynharwyf.\nThe glory of the martyr spell functioned like an advanced version of the shield other spell, in that it worked on multiple recipients.\nFurthermore, if the caster of glory of the martyr died while it was still active, then the spell ended in a burst of positive energy that healed the linked recipients.\nTo function, the spell required each subject and the caster to wear a platinum ring, valued at 50 gp or more. These served as a focus.\nThe glory of the martyr spell originated among the faithful of Ilmater, and was created by the Crying God himself. However, it since spread to paladins of other faiths.\nA paladin of Ilmater once prayed for glory of the martyr to protect his allies in the midst of a battle with skeleton warriors.\nCategoryAbjuration spells\nCategoryIlmatari spells\nCategoryPaladin spells\n79qo47nj4ccjzkm9zsjgi6913pjehc2"
