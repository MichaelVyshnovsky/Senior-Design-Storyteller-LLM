        "mainbody": "'''Glory of the martyr''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[abjuration]] spell for [[paladin]]s that granted a protective ward to multiple subjects, transferring some of their wounds to the spellcaster and healing them if the caster should die. Although created by [[Ilmater]], the Crying God, and used by his [[Church of Ilmater|faithful]], the spell spread to paladins of other faiths.",
        "Users": "The spell could be cast by [[paladin]]s—originally only those of Ilmater, but later of other faiths. It could also be cast by [[champion of Gwynharwyf|champions of Gwynharwyf]].",
        "Effect": "The ''glory of the martyr'' spell functioned like an advanced version of the ''[[shield other]]'' spell, in that it worked on multiple recipients.{{cite book/Player's Handbook v.3.5|278}}\n\nFurthermore, if the caster of ''glory of the martyr'' died while it was still active, then the spell ended in a burst of [[positive energy]] that healed the linked recipients.",
        "Components": "To function, the spell required each subject and the caster to wear a [[platinum]] ring, valued at 50 [[gp]] or more. These served as a focus.",
        "History": "The ''glory of the martyr'' spell originated among the [[Church of Ilmater|faithful of Ilmater]], and was created by the Crying God himself. However, it since spread to paladins of other faiths.\n\nA paladin of Ilmater once prayed for ''glory of the martyr'' to protect his allies in the midst of a battle with [[skeleton]] warriors.",
