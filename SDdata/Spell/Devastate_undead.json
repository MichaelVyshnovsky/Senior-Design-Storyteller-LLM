        "mainbody": "'''''Devastate undead''''', also known as '''''disrupt undead''''', was an [[arcane]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that sapped [[undead]] of their [[negative energy]] and destroyed them.",
        "Effects": "The spellcaster fired a beam at a number of undead targets and destroyed them in a manner similar to the power of a ''[[disruption]]'' weapon. A particularly resilient undead could resist or even be unaffected by the spell. A living being was immune to its effect.\n\nThe spell had a secondary effect of channeling [[Negative Energy plane|negative energy]] from a damaged or destroyed undead back to the caster. This could either hurt the caster (if they were alive) or heal the caster (if they were undead themselves).",
        "Components": "The spell required a ''disruption'' weapon of any kind as a focus.",
        "History": "The ''devastate undead'' spell was developed by the arch-[[lich]] [[Larloch]]. He used it to heal himself by sacrificing his undead servant creatures. He could even potentially use it to permanently boost his unlife force."
