        "mainbody": "Devastate undead, also known as disrupt undead, was an arcane necromancy spell that sapped undead of their negative energy and destroyed them.\nThe spellcaster fired a beam at a number of undead targets and destroyed them in a manner similar to the power of a disruption weapon. A particularly resilient undead could resist or even be unaffected by the spell. A living being was immune to its effect.\nThe spell had a secondary effect of channeling negative energy from a damaged or destroyed undead back to the caster. This could either hurt the caster (if they were alive) or heal the caster (if they were undead themselves).\nThe spell required a disruption weapon of any kind as a focus.\nThe devastate undead spell was developed by the arch-lich Larloch. He used it to heal himself by sacrificing his undead servant creatures. He could even potentially use it to permanently boost his unlife force."
