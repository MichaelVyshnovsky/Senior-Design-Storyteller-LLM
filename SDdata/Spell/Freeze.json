        "mainbody": "Freeze was a divine magic spell available to priests of Auril, the Frostmaiden. It could attack a creature with biting cold and possibly encase the target in ice.\nThis spell could be cast at a single target, in sight, up to 170 ft (52 m) away (more experienced casters could extend this range). When cast, a white beam of light shot from the casters outstretched hand and, if the attack on the target succeeded, caused the victim to suffer damage from intense cold. A creature struck by freeze had one chance to avoid the second, more devastating effect of this spell&mdashbeing encased in a sheath of solid ice 5 inches (13 centimeters) thick that continuously subjected the individual to the same cold damage as the white ray.\nWhile a victim was frozen in ice, he or she was awake, aware, and could breathe normally, but could not move or speak except to try and break free using brute strength. Flying creatures immediately fell from the sky, swimming creatures bobbed like a small iceberg. They could perform mental actions that did not require speech or movement, such as a spell-like ability, but casting a spell with no verbal or somatic components still required any material components, holy symbols, or spellcasting foci to already be in their hand at the time of freezing.\nIronically, while the frozen creature continuously took cold damage from the ice, they were protected from physical damage by the same ice. Any blows had to first destroy the ice (thus freeing the victim) before damaging the creature. Once the ice was sufficiently cracked, it was slightly easier to break free using strength from within. The ice remained in place until destroyed or until the duration of the spell ran out, whichever came first. The ice immediately melted after the spell expired.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components as well as the use of the casters holy symbol or divine focus.\nThis spell was believed to be recorded in a holy book of Auril called Revelations of the Icedawn and was only granted to her clerical and druidic followers."
