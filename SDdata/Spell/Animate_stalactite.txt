Animate stalactite was a spell used by clerics of Callarduran Smoothhands.
When cast, this spell animated a stalactite to behave similar as a piercer. The spell remained dormant until triggered by a nearby target. Once triggered, the stalactite dropped from the ceiling of the cave or tunnel in an attempt to pierce the target. At this point, the spell expired. If dispel magic was cast upon the stalactite before the spell was activated, the spell expired. The caster could only cast this spell on a single stalactite at any given time.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Callarduran Smoothhands.
