        "mainbody": "'''''Locate creature''''' was a [[divination]] spell that allowed the caster to sense the location and movement of a well-visualized creature.",
        "Effects": "Similar to ''[[locate object]]'', this spell could find a creature familiar to the caster within a radius of at least {{SI|560|ft}}&mdash;the range increased with the experience level of the caster but would not cross running water. ''Locate creature'' could also find a creature by race or species (such as an [[elf]] or an [[umber hulk]]) as long as the caster had previously met or at least seen one from a distance of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} or less. This spell could not locate objects and could be fooled by ''[[mislead]]'', ''[[nondetection]]'', and ''[[polymorph]]'' spells.\n\nThis spell was incapable of penetrating through [[crystal sphere]]s and could not travel through the void of [[wildspace]]. However, it could extend to its full range inside the [[phlogiston]].",
        "Components": "The [[material component]] for this spell was a tuft of fur from a [[bloodhound]]. The spell also had a [[verbal component]] and part of the [[somatic component]] was to turn slowly around in a circle until the desired creature was sensed.",
        "History": "In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Diviner's Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] actively sold [[scroll]]s containing ''locate creature'' for around 2,350 [[gp]].{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Living City: The Ravens Bluff Diviner's Guild|16}}"
