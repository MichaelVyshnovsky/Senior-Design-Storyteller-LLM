        "mainbody": "Locate creature was a divination spell that allowed the caster to sense the location and movement of a well-visualized creature.\nSimilar to locate object, this spell could find a creature familiar to the caster within a radius of at least &mdashthe range increased with the experience level of the caster but would not cross running water. Locate creature could also find a creature by race or species (such as an elf or an umber hulk) as long as the caster had previously met or at least seen one from a distance of  or less. This spell could not locate objects and could be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells.\nThis spell was incapable of penetrating through crystal spheres and could not travel through the void of wildspace. However, it could extend to its full range inside the phlogiston.\nThe material component for this spell was a tuft of fur from a bloodhound. The spell also had a verbal component and part of the somatic component was to turn slowly around in a circle until the desired creature was sensed.\nIn the midâ€“14 century DR, the Diviners Guild of Ravens Bluff actively sold scrolls containing locate creature for around 2,350 gp."
