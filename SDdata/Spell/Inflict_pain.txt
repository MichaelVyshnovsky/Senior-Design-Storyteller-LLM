'''''Inflict pain''''' was a [[psionic]] power of the [[telepathy]] [[discipline]] that caused debilitating agony in the target.

==Effects==
After making [[contact]], the manifester inflicted a telepathic stab at the mind of a nearby victim, causing horrible pain that debilitated them in all areas rather than causing real injury. Even those with the willpower to exist, whether to fight or resist interrogation, remained hampered. The manifester could even choose the type of pain inflicted.

It affected only one target, but could increase in number and effectiveness with more psionic energy. It lasted about a quarter of a minute, or more for experienced manifesters.

Only [[evil]]-minded people could learn it easily; others who tried to use it were inevitably bent toward evil.

==Prerequisite Powers==
It could require ''[[contact]]'' and ''[[mindlink]]'' to learn.

==Displays==
It caused the standard mental [[display]].

==Significance==
''Inflict pain'' was an especially cruel form of torture, and it was effective as it did no actual harm and made no marks or scars. Even knowing this did not help victims resist; it was just too painful for them to bear and prolonged abuse left them traumatized and almost in a state of catatonia. Those who succumbed in torture soon pleaded for mercy and yielded whatever information was demanded.

==Users==
''Inflict pain'' was known innately by [[haun]]s. They used it to harm their foes and make their [[haundar]] docile, deter intruders, and to break the wills of slaves.

In psionics terms, ''inflict pain'' could be known by [[yuan-ti]].
