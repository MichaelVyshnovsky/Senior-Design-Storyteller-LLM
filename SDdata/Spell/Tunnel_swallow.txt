Tunnel swallow was a conjuration spell that caused a tunnel to crush others.
Tunnel swallow could only be cast in a tunnel. To be more precise, it affected a 50 feet (15 meters) at maximum section of a tunnel with a diameter of no more than 20 feet (6 meters). Furthermore, tunnel in this case included not only naturally including tunnels, but also manufactured ones or even corridors of surface buildings. The affected section started to convulse like a pump and pumped the contents of the section into whichever the direction the caster wanted it to be transported. Naturally, these contents were crushed and this could be lethally dangerous for creatures in the affected section.
While it was practically impossible to completely dodge the crushing movement, people who reacted fast enough could defend themselves from large parts of the crushing movement and prevent being moved into the direction the caster wanted them to be to some degrees.
Despite these movements, the spell caused no structural damage on the tunnel and after the effect ended, the tunnel returned to normal.
Tunnel swallow required somatic, verbal, and material components in the form of chewed meat or vegetables.
