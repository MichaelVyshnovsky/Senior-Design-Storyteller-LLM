Cure scurvy was a divine abjuration spell used by specialty priests devoted to Valkur, enabling them to cure scurvy.
This spell allowed the caster to instantly cure scurvyâ€“a common disease among malnourished sailors.
Inflict scurvy could be cast to inflict a single target with the same disease if they were within  of the caster. The effects of scurvy could be negated by a cure disease spell or by including fresh fruit in the diet.
In addition to verbal components and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a salt-encrusted pit of a fruit to cast.
