'''''Steam breath''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] and [[bajang]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, the wu jen expelled steam from their mouth. This steam was extremely hot. The expelled steam formed a cone 30 feet (9 meters) long and 20 feet (6 meters) wide at the end. The steam caused tremendous damage to a target creature, scalding them. Creatures from the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] were able to weather the spell but creatures from the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] were particularly vulnerable to this spell. All fire, mundane or magical, within the spell's area of effect would be extinguished.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s. The wu jen dropped a red-hot [[charcoal]] into water at casting.
