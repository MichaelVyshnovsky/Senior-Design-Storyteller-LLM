Steam breath was a common spell used by wu jen and bajang in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, the wu jen expelled steam from their mouth. This steam was extremely hot. The expelled steam formed a cone 30 feet (9 meters) long and 20 feet (6 meters) wide at the end. The steam caused tremendous damage to a target creature, scalding them. Creatures from the Elemental Plane of Water were able to weather the spell but creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire were particularly vulnerable to this spell. All fire, mundane or magical, within the spells area of effect would be extinguished.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components. The wu jen dropped a red-hot charcoal into water at casting.
