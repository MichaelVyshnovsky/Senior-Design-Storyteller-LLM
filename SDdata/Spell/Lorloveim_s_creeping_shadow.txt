'''''Lorloveim's creeping shadow''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s. This spell was developed by [[Lorloveim]].

==Effects==
This spell caused the caster's shadow to elongate out from their body. The distance the shadow was capable of expanding depended on the skill of the caster. The caster could move their shadow where they wished and it behaved like a normal shadow. The shadow was utterly silent and practically invisible unless in the brightest setting.

The caster was able to speak, see, and hear through their shadow. The shadow could not physically interact with anything. It could only be harmed by spells or enchanted weapons.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a small statuette of the caster to cast. The sculpture needed to be carved from [[obsidian]] and worth at least 1,000 [[gold piece]]s. A light source at least as bright as a [[candle]] needed to be present when the spell was cast.
