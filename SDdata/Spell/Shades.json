It was always less effective on objects, as objects were incapable of belief in the first place.\nShades was considered a more powerful version of the spells shadow conjuration and greater shadow conjuration, being capable of creating stronger illusions than both.\nShades used verbal and somatic components only.\nThe spell was created by Netherese arcanist Shadow in  and was originally called Shadows shades.\nThe spell was under common usage among the assassins of the Jaezred Chaulssin by the 14 century DR."
