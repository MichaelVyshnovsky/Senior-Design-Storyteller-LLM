Summon undead I, also known as undead summoning I, was the weakest of the series of summon undead spells available to arcane casters in the Realms.
This spell could summon a medium-sized skeleton or small zombie. Usually, the skeleton of a human warrior or a kobold zombie were chosen.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a piece of bone from either a ghast, ghoul or wight.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
