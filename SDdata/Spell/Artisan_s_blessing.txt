Artisans blessing was a channel divinity power granted to clerics who chose the Forge domain.
In order to channel divinity, the cleric had to conduct a ritual that lasted an hour. The ritual involved laying out the coins or other metal on top of a surface, that were equal in value to the thing that was to be created. Once the ritual had finished, an item that contained some sort of metal (tools, weapon, armor, etc) would coalease on top of a free unoccipied surface within . The produced item could not be magical or be worth greater than 100 gold pieces.
