}}'''''Genie contract''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[genie]]s to seal a contract that was magically binding to the two parties involved. Both sides had to agree willingly to the terms, and a punishment was defined for anyone transgressing them. Genies employed this spell to all kinds of formal agreements between them and mortals, or between two mortals with the genie as a witness.
