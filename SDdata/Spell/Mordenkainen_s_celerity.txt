}}'''''Mordenkainen's celerity''''' was a [[spell]] that improved the efficacy and duration of other velocity-altering spells.

==Effects==
If ''Mordenkainen's celerity'' was cast by the same person moments before a spell such as ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[haste]]'', ''[[jump]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', or ''[[spider climb]]'', the magical speed granted by that spell and its duration increased by a factor of 25%. In the case of ''feather fall'', the falling speed could also be reduced by the same amount if the caster so desired. Additionally, a casting of ''haste'' following the spell affected more creatures.

The spell also improved the caster's defense against speed-reducing spells such as ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[slow]]'', and ''[[web]]'', as well as magically induced paralysis.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and material components. The material required was a small container filled with either centipede or millipede legs.

==History==
By the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]], the spell was well-known and relatively common across [[Faerûn]],
