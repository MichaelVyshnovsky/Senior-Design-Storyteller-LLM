'''''Fireflow''''' was a [[wild magic]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by [[wild mage]]s.

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to control normal fires. As this was a wild magic spell, the caster accomplished this by adjusting randomness and probabilities in order to shape and direct the fire as they wished. The target fire could be moved about in any direction provided it was not through the air. The flames could even spread over surfaces like snow, ice and water. Objects and creatures contacting the fire did so as if they contacted the fire in its original form regardless of its current size and shape. For example, if the caster used a lit candle as the source of the spell but made it grow to the size of an inferno, anyone stepping into the fire would only be burned as if they touched a lit candle.

Any lapse in the caster's concentration would cause the spell to fail. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a small paintbrush and a pot of pitch to cast.
