Improved mantle was an incredibly powerful spell used by wizards.
When cast, this spell temporarily gave the caster total invulnerability to all mundane and some magical weapons. Both the casting time and the duration of this spell were incredibly short. The spell did not protect the caster from powerful magical weapons.
