'''''Merald's meld''''' was an [[arcane]], [[alteration]] [[spell]] used in the creation of [[item enchantment|magical item]]s, binding two objects that were not otherwise physically joined.

This spell would magically connect two items, even if the substances from which they were made could be joined by non-magical means. This attachment could destroyed by four castings of ''[[dispel magic]]'', unless it was reinforced by a casting of ''[[crown meld]]''.

==Components==
The material components of this spell were a spot of resin, a flake of [[iron]] or [[silver]], a strand of [[spider silk]] and a paste made from legumes.
