Meralds meld was an arcane, alteration spell used in the creation of magical items, binding two objects that were not otherwise physically joined.
This spell would magically connect two items, even if the substances from which they were made could be joined by non-magical means. This attachment could destroyed by four castings of dispel magic, unless it was reinforced by a casting of crown meld.
The material components of this spell were a spot of resin, a flake of iron or silver, a strand of spider silk and a paste made from legumes.
