'''''Fiendform''''' was an [[alteration]]/[[transmutation]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to assume the appearance, and some of the abilities of a [[fiend]] from the [[Outer Planes]].

==Effects==
For the duration of the spell, the caster assumed the form of any [[Fiendish creature|fiendish]] being, even a [[baatezu]], [[tanar'ri]] or [[yugoloth]] however they became adept with many other abilities of the creature they became.

Anything that occurred to the spellcaster while in the ''fiendform'' still affected them once its duration was over. If they were killed before the spell ended, they had the chance of dying once they reverted to their normal form. While it was possible for the spellcaster to simply fall into a coma for a matter of hours, it was more likely their death would send them to the [[Abyss]], reformed as a [[mane]]. If this was the case, their body could not be ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]'' upon the [[Prime Material plane]].

The fiendish form the caster transformed into was entirely random,The [[Spellbound]] campaign guide refers to this creature as a ''bar-igura''. [[cambion]], [[chasme]], [[dergholoth]], [[mezzoloth]], [[nabassu]], [[nycaloth]], [[succubus]], [[vrock]] or [[yugoloth]]. The versions more popular around {{yearlink|1372}} afforded the same degree of control over the final shape as a regular summoning.

==Casting==
The spell could only be cast by [[evil]]-aligned [[arcane spellcaster]]s. It required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s as well as a crystal statue of any type of fiend, worth at least 3000 [[gp]]. While the statue was destroyed upon the end of ''fiendform's'' duration, its premature destruction resulted in a similarly early end of the spell's effects.

The ''transmutation'' version of this spell lacked the somatic component to its casting, and rather consumed the [[material component]] of a single bone of any [[fiend]]ish creature or [[half-fiend]].
