Named for the consort to the eladrin queen Morwel, Faerinaals hymn was an enchantment spell for bards that prevented opportunistic attacks by evil creatures.
By playing a gentle hymn, the spell clouded the minds of evil beings in close range who heard it, making them forget to attack when an opportunity presented itself. It lasted as long as the bard concentrated and continued playing it.
It required only a verbal component, being the hymn itself.
