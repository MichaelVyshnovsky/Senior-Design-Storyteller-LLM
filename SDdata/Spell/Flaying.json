        "mainbody": "Flaying was a gruesome spell from the necromancy school of magic, used by arcane spellcasters as well as by Dreadmasters of Bane.\nFlaying could be cast on any creature within the casters eyesight, and the target had a chance of resisting its effects. The affected creature had their skin and flesh peeled from their bodies in steps, leaving the wounds magically open and bleeding and the targets vulnerable to blood loss and infection."
