The '''''curse of the dark dream''''' was a [[warlock]] [[invocation]] of moderate complexity, which could only be cast once per day. 

==Effects==
When a warlock cast ''curse of the dark dream'', he or she struck into the mind of a creature within fifty feet, filling their thoughts with nightmarish visions as though they were asleep. Creatures who failed to resist the attack became clumsy in their movements, following a path to "safety" up to fifteen feet in length, created for them by the warlock's will. With a little extra effort, warlocks could move their victim a bit further, before the effects of the spell wore off.<ref>
