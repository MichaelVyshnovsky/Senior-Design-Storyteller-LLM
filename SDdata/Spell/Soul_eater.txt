Soul eater was an arcane necromancy spell that damaged creatures and made use of their life essence.
When cast, soul eater damaged all living creatures in a  radius. Only those that died as a result would have their life essence exploited. In such a case, the creatures would be transformed into skeletons that fought for the caster. The caster themself also became much stronger, more robust, and more dexterous, proportional to how many enemies killed from the original casting of soul eater.
