        "mainbody": "Rune chant was a divine abjuration/evocation spell that was granted to select dwarven paragons by the Morndinsamman. In times of great need, it would be granted to clan leaders, legendary heroes, or the High Old Ones of Dumathoin.\nWhen cast, this spell created a certain rune of power to appear anywhere within a certain distance from the caster. There were numerous dwarvish words that could be used to manifest one of these runes, with a variety of different effects."
