In times of great need, it would be granted to clan leaders, legendary heroes, or the [[High Old One]]s of [[Dumathoin]].\n\nWhen cast, this spell created a certain ''[[rune of power]]'' to appear anywhere within a certain distance from the caster. There were numerous [[dwarvish]] words that could be used to manifest one of these runes, with a variety of different effects."
