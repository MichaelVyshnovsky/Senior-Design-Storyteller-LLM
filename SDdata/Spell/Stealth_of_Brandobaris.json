        "mainbody": "Stealth of Brandobaris was a divine magic spell granted to priests of Brandobaris, the Trickster. It greatly improved the casters ability to move in silence and hide in the shadows, like a trained thief.\nThis spell only affected the casters abilitiesâ€”it could not be cast on others. The spell lasted for at least fifteen minutes (longer for more experienced casters) but could be negated by a successful dispel magic or similar effect. In general, the more experienced the caster was, the greater the chances of successful sneaking and hiding while under the influence of this spell. Misadventurers (specialty priests of Brandobaris) and those that already had some thieving experience were blessed with an even greater improvement to the odds.\nThis spell could be cast silently, requiring only a somatic component and the priests holy symbol."
