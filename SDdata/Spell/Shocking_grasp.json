            "Inscription": "According to the tome known as the ''[[Book of the Silver Talon]]'', the ingredients for the [[ink]] used to inscribe ''shocking grasp'' into [[spellbook]]s were: one ounce of [[giant octopus]] ink, an ounce of ash from a tree that was struck by lightning, four drops of [[holy water]], a powdered [[sapphire]], one pinch of powdered [[orichalcum]], [[asafetida]], [[balm of gilead]], [[ginseng]] and either [[mace (spice)|mace]] or [[masterwort]]. \n\nThe [[herb]]s were burnt in an [[oak]]wood fire, the ash of which was combined with the ash from the tree in a small bowl of either [[copper]] or white orichalcum. Two drops of holy water were added to the bowl and stirred into a paste, after which the powdered sapphire and metal were thrown in the last two drops of the holy water. When it was all stirred together into a paste, it was added to the octopus ink and heated to a boil, while constantly stirred."
        },
        "Variations": "There existed a variation of ''shocking grasp'' called ''enervating grasp''. The different between the two was that ''enervating grasp'' was inflicted [[necrotic energy]] upon the body of the target, rather than electricity. The specifications of this spell could be found in ''[[The Tome of Blasphemous Magic]]''.",
        "Known Users": "[[File:Shocking Grasp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[bugbear]] being struck by a ''shocking grasp''.]]\nPre-spellplague, the [[underwizards]] of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] typically knew and used this spell.\n\n[[Calishite]] [[elementalist]]s who followed the Tradition of [[Air]] were especially adept at the casting of ''shocking grasp''."
