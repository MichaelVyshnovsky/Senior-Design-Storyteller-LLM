        "mainbody": "Spider shapes was a divine transmutation spell that transformed its subjects into spiders. It was unique to clerics who worshiped deities with the Spider domain.\nThis spell functioned much in the same manner as spells like polymorph other. The caster could transform several willing creatures into monstrous spiders of any size, though he or she could not change different creatures into different-sized spiders with the same casting. Up to seventeen creatures, or more for more experienced casters could be affect, provided they were within 30 feet of each other in close and began 65 feet (20 meters) or more from the caster. The spell had no effect on unwilling creatures.\nThose transformed stayed in spider form for the duration of the spell (17 hours or more) or until the caster dismissed it for the whole group. Individuals could elect to return to their normal forms, but this ended the spell for that individual.\nBody parts removed from the spiders did not revert to their original forms. A side-effect of this was these spiders had venomous bites.\nUnlike with polymorph other, those transformed with spider shapes suffered no disorientation. Furthermore, they also became refreshed and healed as if theyd received a full days rest.\nIt required verbal and somatic components, as well as a divine focus."
