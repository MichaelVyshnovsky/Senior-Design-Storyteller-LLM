        "mainbody": "Thunderball was an uncommon evocation spell of the southern magic tradition.\nThe spell created an explosive blast of lightning followed by a clap of thunder. It caused damage to all creatures within 20 feet (6 meters), the thunder causing hearing damage to some. A single creature could be targeted, and they were automatically deafened as well as taking twice the damage.   \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, an amber rod."
