        "mainbody": "Manshoons xorn talons, also known as stony hands, was a conjuration spell that created a crescent-shaped area in front of the caster, where any creature passing through would be grabbed at or otherwise harassed by taloned, stone arms that erupted from the ground. It was developed by the Zhentarim wizard Manshoon.\nThe area created by xorn talons was in the shape of an outward-facing crescent moon,  across at the center and  at the horns. During the spells duration, whenever a person or creature traveled across the area, they were clawed, grasped at, and raked by stone talons that emerged from the ground beneath them. These appendages were unintelligent claws that resembled the three upper limbs of xorn from the Elemental Plane of Earth.\nThe talons could be destroyed by normal means, or by the spells stone to flesh and rock to mud and the duration of their existence could be lessened by a successful casting of dispel magic.\nThe spell had verbal, somatic, and material components, the last a single piece of xorn flesh, hide or bone.\nThe spell was developed by Manshoon. Sometime in the 14 century DR, knowledge of the spell was spread either by Manshoon himself or one of his apprentices, and shared by Elminster with Dalamar and Mordenkainen during one of their meetings, which happened shortly after the defeat of Vecna in his first attempt at becoming a greater deity."
