        "mainbody": "'''''Manshoon's xorn talons''''', also known as '''''stony hands''''', was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that created a crescent-shaped area in front of the caster, where any creature passing through would be grabbed at or otherwise harassed by taloned, stone arms that erupted from the ground. It was developed by the [[Zhentarim]] [[wizard]] [[Manshoon]].",
        "Effects": "The area created by ''xorn talons'' was in the shape of an outward-facing crescent moon, {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} across at the center and {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} at the 'horns'. During the spell's duration, whenever a person or creature traveled across the area, they were clawed, grasped at, and raked by stone talons that emerged from the ground beneath them. These appendages were unintelligent claws that resembled the three upper limbs of [[xorn]] from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]].\n\nThe talons could be destroyed by normal means, or by the spells ''[[stone to flesh]]'' and ''[[rock to mud]]'' and the duration of their existence could be lessened by a successful casting of ''[[dispel magic]]''.",
        "Components": "The spell had [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s, the last a single piece of xorn flesh, hide or bone.",
        "History": "The spell was developed by [[Manshoon]]. Sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], knowledge of the spell was spread either by Manshoon himself or one of his apprentices, and shared by [[Elminster]] with [[Dalamar]] and [[Mordenkainen]] during one of their meetings, which happened shortly after the defeat of [[Vecna]] in his first attempt at becoming a [[greater deity]]."
