        "mainbody": "Creeping cold was a druidic transmutation spell from the second circle of magic that dealt cold damage.\nWhen the spell was unleash on any one creature within  from the caster, their sweat was turned to ice that left blistering cold burns all over the body, on the surface and inside the skin. The freeze-burning continued on for nineteen seconds, dealing more damage as more seconds passed.\nThe spell required a druidic spell focus â€“ a pottery or a glass container with ice, worth at least 25 gp as well as a somatic and a verbal component."
