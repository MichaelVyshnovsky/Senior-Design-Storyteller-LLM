Resist injury was a rare abjuration spell of the southern magic tradition.
When cast, the caster was protected from injury. The spell did not protect from certain spells. The caster was still vulnerable to charm, draining or death spells, such as death or disintegration.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component. For the duration of the spell, the caster wore an amethyst or jade pendant.
