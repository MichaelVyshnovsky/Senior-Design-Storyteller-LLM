Blackjammers cutlass was a +3 intelligent heavy cutlass that was highly desired and renowned by spelljammer pirates and marauders.
Although it was a heavy cutlass of ancient design, Blackjammers cutlass was surprisingly light. The blade did not appear to be made of metal, save for the hilt, and its cutting edge was composed of a material resembling a dull, matte onyx. Its elaborate hilt was carved to resemble a keelhauled sailor.
The +3 intelligent cutlass had powers similar to that of a defending weapon, could conjure darkness within a 15 (4.6-m) radius and granted its wielder the ability to see through that obstruction.
This sword possessed a ribald personality, as well a vast knowledge of naval navigation, seamanship, and bawdy jokes. It was speculated to have granted leadership abilities to several of its wielders, as it was known to inspire confidence and morale in their respective pirate crews. Furthermore, it drew its wielder more and more into a life of piracy, imposing some of its personality on them.
The blade was rumored to have been forged in one of the Tears of Sel√ªne, and wielded by a spelljamming pirate who earned his name from the blade itself. Blackjammer was known to raid Realmspace up until his death in the late 13 century DR.
The cutlass passed from owner to owner for several years until coming into the possession of Elsun, the captain of the Dragon Claw. After Elsun was killed in combat against a man-o-war of the Elven Imperial Navy, Blackjammers cutlass was lost overboard and last seen floating in the Flow between the crystal spheres Oerth and Krynn.
