Detect dwarves was a spell used by clerics of Sharindlar.
When cast, this spell allowed the caster to detect any dwarves up to  in front of the caster. The spell was capable of detecting azer, derro, duergar, half-dwarves and even dead dwarves or dwarven blood. Even if hidden by an illusion-based spell, invisible, or shapechanged.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, the holy symbol of Sharindlar.
