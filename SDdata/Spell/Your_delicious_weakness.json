When your delicious weakness is cast, the warlock strikes into the mind of a creature within fifty feet, uncovering their weaknesses and using those weaknesses against them. The spell is normally charged by a warlocks strength of personality but warlocks of the dark pact are able to enhance the deadliness of the spell through concentrating their intellect. Your delicious weakness can be cast with relative ease and reacquired after its casting through a rest of a few minutes or more.\nCategoryWarlock spells\nha0qudxqx7fcsoiyfd5o1poclve7lc6"
