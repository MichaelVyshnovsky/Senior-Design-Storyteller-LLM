        "mainbody": "'''''Your delicious weakness''''', is a [[spell]] used by some [[warlock]]s, particularly those who forge pacts with [[demon]]ic powers of the [[Abyss]]. When ''your delicious weakness'' is cast, the warlock strikes into the mind of a creature within fifty feet, uncovering their weaknesses and using those weaknesses against them. The spell is normally charged by a warlock's strength of personality but warlocks of the [[Warlock#Dark Pact Warlock|dark pact]] are able to enhance the deadliness of the spell through concentrating their intellect. ''Your delicious weakness'' can be cast with relative ease and reacquired after its casting through a rest of a few minutes or more.",
