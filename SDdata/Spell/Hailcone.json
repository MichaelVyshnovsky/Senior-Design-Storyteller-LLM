        "mainbody": "Hailcone was an evocation spell used to create dangerous shards of hail. This spell was created by the wizard Aubayreer.\nThis spell caused large bits of hail to rain down into the area of effect. The shards originated roughly  above the area and rained down to strike anything within a  cone beneath them.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a pinch of dust and several drops of water to cast."
