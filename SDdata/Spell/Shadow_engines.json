        "mainbody": "Shadow engines was a divine illusion spell from the war sphere that created the illusion of siege engines.\nThis spell created the illusion of up to four siege engines and crews. The casting priest could select any combination of ballistae, siege towers, catapults, etc. The magic powering the illusory siege engines imparted a tenuous reality to them, allowing them to inflict physical damage on targets. The shadow engines would last until the spell expired, enemies approached within , or they were damaged by a missile attack. The destruction of one shadow engine did not affect the remaining ones.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material components a detailed miniature model of a siege engine to cast. The model was destroyed during the casting.\nThe Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the Mystran faith, could cast the shadow engines spell."
