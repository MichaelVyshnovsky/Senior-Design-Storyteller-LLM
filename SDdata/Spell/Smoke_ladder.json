        "mainbody": "'''''Smoke ladder''''', also known as '''''cloud ladder''''', was a common spell used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]] that molded smoke into a functional [[ladder]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "With this spell a wu jen was able to create a ladder of {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} or more. This ladder was always rigid, and weighed almost nothing. The ladder was steady and required no support. Only one creature at a time was able to climb the ladder. The spell could also be cast on an existing ladder, which increased the duration of the spell. The summoned ladder lasted until the wu jen ended the spell or until the spell expired.\n\nThe spell could be used inside the atmosphere of a [[spelljammer]] but was unable to create a ladder in the void or [[Phlogiston]].",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], the smoke from the fire of burning green wood."
