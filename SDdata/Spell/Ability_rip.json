        "mainbody": "Ability rip was an arcane transmutation spell that allowed the caster to strip away a supernatural or spell-like ability from one creature and grant it to another.\nFor a number of hours, the first creature targeted by the spell would lose an ability that was specified by the caster. During the same amount of time, a second creature of the casters choosing gained this power but lost one that they possessed.\nThe material component for this spell was a caterpillar within a cocoon."
