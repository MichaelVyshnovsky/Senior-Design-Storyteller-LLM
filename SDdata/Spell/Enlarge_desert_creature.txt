}}'''''Enlarge desert creature''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This spell let the caster increase the size of a desert creature. This spell could be used on any creature but worked best on those whose natural habitat was the desert. The maximum size the creature could be enlarged was twice its original size. A creature could not be made larger than its immediate surroundings would physically permit. 

The reverse of this spell, '''''diminish desert creature''''', had the exact opposite effect.

==Components==
This spell and the reversible counterpart required a small stick of [[teak]] or [[mahogany]] to cast.
