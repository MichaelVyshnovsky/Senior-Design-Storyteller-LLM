Tirumaels energy spheres was an evocation spell used by wizards and sorcerers. This spell was created by Tirumael.
This spell created five spheres of energy that orbited the casters head at a distance of one foot. These spheres provided the same amount of light as a dancing lights spell. Each sphere was represented by one of the five types of energyâ€”acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic.
The spheres could be used offensively to strike targets within range. Conversely, the spheres could be used defensive if attacked by a corresponding energy type by absorbing some of the harmful energy.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required five glass marbles to cast.
