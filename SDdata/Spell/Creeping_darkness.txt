Creeping darkness was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, the spell created a small, shapeless cloud of blackness 2×3×5 feet (0.6×0.9×1.5 meters) in area. The caster was able to shape and move the cloud within the range of the spell, which was 240 yards (219 meters). The cloud was impenetrable to all forms of vision, but some spells such as true seeing could penetrate the cloud. Within the cloud, all sound was absorbed, creating an area of total silence. The spell was vulnerable to wind. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a single whisker from an old black cat and a small bottle of smoke that was captured on a moonless night.
The squatting toad, a magical chalice carved in the shape of a toad, was able to cast this spell.
