Biting shadow was an improved version of the spell slicing shadow.
When this spell was cast, it conjured a dark cloud that appeared to have a number of gaping maws lined with fangs. It could be willed by the caster to slowly drift in any direction.
Any person or creature caught within the biting shadow was bit by its many mouths.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast.
