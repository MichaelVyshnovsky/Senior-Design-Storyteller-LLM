        "mainbody": "Glitterdust (originally called Fahrens glitterdust) was a conjuration spell from the creation subschool that created a burst of golden particles that stuck to everything in an area.\nUpon completing this spell, the caster created a cloud of glittering dust with a twenty-foot diameter within a medium distance. The particles stuck to anyone and anything, including invisible creatures or objects, which allowed their outlines to be recognized. In addition to this revelatory effect, the glitter particles could blind some creatures for a short time.\nTo cast this spell required verbal and somatic components and some ground mica.\nThe spell was invented by the Netherese arcanist Fahren in  as one of his blindness-related spells.\nThe spell was indirectly the cause of Fahrens murder ten years later, because one of Fahrens students had used the spell to blind the guards of one of Fahrens rivals and steal from him. When this rival traced the spell back to Fahren, the rival killed Fahren with a sphere of annihilation.\nIn the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast glitterdust within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.\n* During the Time of Troubles in the , Kyriani cast glitterdust against the brainwashed Luna in an effort to subdue her. However, Lunas godly magic was too strong, and she was able to blow the glitter away as a whirlwind. Nevertheless, the distraction was enough for Vajra Valmeyjar to tackle Luna."
