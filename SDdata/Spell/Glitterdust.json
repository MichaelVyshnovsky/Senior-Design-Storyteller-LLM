        "mainbody": "'''''Glitterdust''''' (originally called '''''Fahren's glitterdust''''') was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] from the [[:Category:Creation spells|creation subschool]] that created a burst of golden particles that stuck to everything in an area.",
        "Effects": "Upon completing this spell, the caster created a cloud of glittering dust with a twenty-foot diameter within a medium distance. The particles stuck to anyone and anything, including invisible creatures or objects, which allowed their outlines to be recognized. In addition to this revelatory effect, the glitter particles could blind some creatures for a short time.",
        "Components": "To cast this spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s and some ground [[mica]].",
        "History": "The spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Fahren]] in {{Yearlink|-1472}} as one of his blindness-related spells.\n\nThe spell was indirectly the cause of Fahren's murder [[-1462 DR|ten years later]], because one of Fahren's students had used the spell to blind the guards of one of Fahren's rivals and steal from him. When this rival traced the spell back to Fahren, the rival killed Fahren with a ''[[sphere of annihilation]]''.\n\nIn the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''glitterdust'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}",
        "Notable Users": "* During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, [[Kyriani]] cast ''glitterdust'' against the brainwashed [[Luna]] in an effort to subdue her. However, Luna's godly magic was too strong, and she was able to blow the glitter away as a whirlwind. Nevertheless, the distraction was enough for [[Vajra Valmeyjar]] to tackle Luna.{{Cite comic/Total Eclipse|8}}"
