        "mainbody": "Mental domination was a common spell used by clerics.\nWhen cast, this spell allowed the caster to control a targeted creatures movements. It functioned by creating a temporary telepathic connection with the targeted creature. The caster had to maintain some concentration to keep the telepathic link intact and was not able to cast further spells for the duration of the spell. The caster was able to both control the movement and speech of the targeted creature, although any speech was given in a monotone. The caster did not have access to the targeted creatures mind or senses. To maintain the telepathic link, the caster had to remain within  of the targeted creature. \nThe complexity of the actions and movements were determined by the casters skill level. Certain races were more susceptible to this spell than others. For example, elves and half-elves lacked the ability to resist this spell. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a mesh made from fine threads. During casting, the caster wrapped one end of the mesh around the tips of their fingers on one hand, gesturing as one would when using a marrionette."
