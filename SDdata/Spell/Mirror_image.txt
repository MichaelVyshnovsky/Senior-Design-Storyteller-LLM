'''''Mirror image''''' allowed the caster to bring several illusions of him or herself into being in the caster's immediate surroundings. The images behaved and looked exactly like the caster, and the caster was able to merge with, or split from, any of the images at will. If an image were struck, such as with a weapon, it disappeared for good.

==Components==
The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Smolyn]] in {{Yearlink|-1916}} and was originally called ''Smolyn's replica''.

==Trivia==
Notably, the [[Cormyr]]ean state sword ''[[Ilbratha]]'' allowed its wielder to cast ''mirror image'' on him or herself (and the sword) once per day.
