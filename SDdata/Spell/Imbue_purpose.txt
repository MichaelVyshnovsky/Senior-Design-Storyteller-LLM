Imbue purpose was a very rare spell used by clerics.
When cast on a weapon, that weapons purpose was now to target and slay a targeted species, either sentient or not. If the caster was of good alignment, the targeted species had to be one that was traditionally evil. If a targeted creature was struck by the weapon, they were killed instantly. In the event that the targeted creature was strong enough to avoid being slain, they instead suffered terrible injuries and fled the area as if they were under the influence of a fear spell.
In addition to a verbal component, this spell required a material component, diamond dust with a value of at least 1,000 gp.
