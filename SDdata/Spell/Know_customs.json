        "mainbody": "Know customs was a divination spell that allowed the caster to acquire knowledge about local laws and customs from a local resident.\nThe caster had to be within 30 yd (27 m) of a person who had the knowledge being sought. The person could be asleep or unconscious, but not an infant, insane, or dead. If the target did not resist the spell, the caster gained general knowledge of how to navigate the social waters of the tribe, village, town, or settlement to which the target belonged. In addition to local laws, customs, and the practice of etiquette, the caster could learn about important festivals or holy days, and specific but widely known things like the password to tell the guards at the main entrance to a city. After successfully gleaning local knowledge, the caster was granted a slightly more favorable reaction by any indigenous people encountered.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nCategoryDivination spells\nCategoryMystic spells\nCategoryShaman spells\n2aqeqbztpy3nas5jjw9huuggmz547zc"
