        "mainbody": "Daze monster was an arcane enchanment spell that could daze a creature.\nSimilar to daze, this spell could cloud the mind of any close-by creature, provided it was alive and no more than moderately powerful, and could not resist through an act of will. It prevented them from acting for several seconds, though they could defend themselves adequately.\nIt required a pinch of wool of the like as a material component, in addition to its verbal and somatic components.\nSome curtains of darkness in Undermountain could affect those who passed through with a daze monster.\n* The Faceless Incanter\n* Zhallandra Valenz\n* Mordak Brelliar"
