'''''Frostbind''''' is an [[transmutation]] [[spell]] used by some [[sorcerer]]s early in their training. When a sorcerer casts ''frostbind'' he or she causes chilling ice to envelop the flesh of a creature within fifty feet, slowing their reactions and injuring them. ''Frostbind'' is relatively difficult to use for its level of complexity and as such a sorcerer is required to rest at least a few minutes before casting it again.
