Frostbind is an transmutation spell used by some sorcerers early in their training. When a sorcerer casts frostbind he or she causes chilling ice to envelop the flesh of a creature within fifty feet, slowing their reactions and injuring them. Frostbind is relatively difficult to use for its level of complexity and as such a sorcerer is required to rest at least a few minutes before casting it again.
