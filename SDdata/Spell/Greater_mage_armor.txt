Greater mage armor was a simple spell used by sorcerers and wizards.
Like mage armor, this spell allowed the caster to create an armor for themselves out of magical force.
Unlike mage armor, this spell did not require a material component, only verbal and somatic components. An earlier version required a material component, a tiny platinum shield worth 25 gp.
