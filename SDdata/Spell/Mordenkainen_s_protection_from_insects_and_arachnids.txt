Mordenkainens protection from insects and arachnids was an uncommon protection spell.
When cast, the caster was given protection from arachnid and insect species. This included swarming insects, scorpions and spiders. The spell also offered protection from the giant-sized version of insects, such as giant scorpions. Additionally, the caster was protected from the venom from arachnid or insect bites or stings.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, an insect encased in amber.
