'''''Master rune''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[combat sphere|combat]] and [[protection sphere]]s that allowed the casting [[priest]] to take control of a glyph, ''[[symbol]]'' or other [[magic]] rune created by someone else.

==Effects==
''Master rune'' prevented a magical glyph from triggering when touched by the casting priest. The caster could greatly diminish the harmful effects of triggering the glyph, but they could not increase the effects. They could also change the conditions that triggered the glyph. The caster would also become aware of the location of any glyph cast within range while the spell was active, allowing them to divert the magic into something else.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.

==History==
''Master rune'' was granted by [[Deneir]], the [[god]] of glyphs.
