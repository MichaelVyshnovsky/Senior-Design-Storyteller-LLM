Master rune was a divine alteration spell from the combat and protection spheres that allowed the casting priest to take control of a glyph, symbol or other magic rune created by someone else.
Master rune prevented a magical glyph from triggering when touched by the casting priest. The caster could greatly diminish the harmful effects of triggering the glyph, but they could not increase the effects. They could also change the conditions that triggered the glyph. The caster would also become aware of the location of any glyph cast within range while the spell was active, allowing them to divert the magic into something else.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
Master rune was granted by Deneir, the god of glyphs.
