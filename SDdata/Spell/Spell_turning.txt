Spell turning was a spell that could turn other spells back onto their caster.
This abjuration spell was able to turn single-target spells away from the target, providing that the target was the caster of spell turning. Therefore, all other spells, such as those that didnt target the caster of spell turning and area of effect spells, would not be turned back. Despite being powerful, there were risks to casting such a spell. If both the attacker and the target were under the affect of spell turning, a resonating field would occur. The spell would usually drain away, affect both targets, or stop spell turning from working. However, it had a very small chance of sending both into another plane.
This spell required somatic, verbal, and material components. The material component was a small silver mirror.
This spell was invented by Netherese arcanist Trebbe in  under the name Trebbes turning as one of his many spells designed to protect against magical attacks.
