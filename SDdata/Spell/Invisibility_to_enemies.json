        "mainbody": "'''''Invisibility to enemies''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "A shugenja used this spell to become invisible, but it could be cast on another creature. The invisible individual was undetectable to evil creatures or creatures who held hostile feelings to the caster or their [[alignment]], and they were even able to walk through other creatures. If the individual attacked another creature while invisible, they became visible. If an item was picked up while invisible, it did not become invisible as well, it appeared to be floating in thin air. This spell had no affect on animals.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell and its reverse required a [[material component]]: a robe of white [[silk]] with handwritten sutras upon it."
