Chill strike is a wizard spell of relatively low complexity. When cast, chill strike creates a bolt of icy cold energy that is purplish in color. The bolt then flies towards its target, which must be somewhere within a range of fifty feet, dazing them if they are animated. The spell is easy to master, but drains its casters energy to a point that, in order to cast it again, the wizard must relieve themselves and rest for a few minutes.
