'''''Necromantic singularity''''' was a [[spell]] of [[epic magic]].

==Effects==
When cast, ''necromantic singularity'' created a temporary link between the [[Prime Material Plane]], the [[Weave]], and the [[Negative Energy Plane]] within 300 feet (91 meters) for a very short time. Through this link came [[negative energy]] in its purest form that killed living beings until it was exhausted. It started with those that were closest to the link and continued to the next nearest living creature and so on until the negative energy was completely exhausted or no lifeform was to be found within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the epicenter.

==Components==
''Necromantic singularity'' required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s. The material component was a ''[[sphere of annihilation]]'' that was destroyed upon casting. The spell took one minute to cast.

==History==
''Necromantic singularity'' was one of the most fearsome spells developed on [[Faer√ªn]]. It took twenty-two days and 1,071,000 [[gp]] to develop it.
