        "mainbody": "Nybors stern reproof was an enchantment spell that caused intense, debilitating pain within a target person or creature.\nThe agony caused by stern reproof was so excruciating that it could instantly kill the affected creature. It was far away more intense than the pain caused by Nybors gentle reminder and Nybors mild admonishment and could continue much longer, depending on the will of the caster.\nStern reproof was developed by the Thayan zulkir of enchantment, Nybor. She inscribed the details of its casting within the book, Nybors Small Codex. It saw regular usage among the Red Wizards during the 14 century DR.\nThe casting of this spell originally only had verbal and somatic components,"
