Focus fear was a common spell that could only be cast by dragons.
A dragon used this spell to create an area of concentrated fear. The spell functioned by focusing an aura of fear into a small area, no less than  in radius. The spell could be used alongside an aura of terror.
The reverse of this spell was extend fear. It allowed a dragon to create a wider area of focus, up to  in radius.
The dragon was able to finely manipulate the radii of both spells. Once cast, both spells did not require further concentration, allowing the dragon to engage in other activities such as casting other spells or flying. Both spells were invulnerable to dispel magic but were vulnerable to limited wish and wish.
This spell required only a verbal component.
