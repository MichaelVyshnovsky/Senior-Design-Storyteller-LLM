'''''Celestial blood''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that granted the subject divine defenses.

==Effect==
The caster channeled holy power and bestowed on the subject a little of the protections normally found in [[celestial]] beings. They acquired resilience to [[acid]], [[cold]], and [[electricity]]; a strong fortitude against [[poison]]s; and reduced injuries (though this was overcome by evil).

==Components==
Along with verbal and somatic components, the caster anointed the subject's head with a vial of [[holy water]].
