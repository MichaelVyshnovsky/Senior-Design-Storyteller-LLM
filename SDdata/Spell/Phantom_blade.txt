}}'''''Phantom blade''''' was a [[spell]] frequently used by the [[Seven Sisters]]. It was sometimes used by [[Harpers]] but was otherwise uncommon.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell created a transparent blade of magical force. The blade, although translucent, resembled a blade made from shadow. The blade acted as a normal sword. When a creature was struck with the blade, they were not only cut but also experienced a deep chill. The blade was especially deadly against [[undead]] creatures and dual-plane creatures, for example creatures who phased between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and the [[Ethereal Plane]]. The sword was useless against inorganic objects.

The blade did not share the same physical properties as a blade created from metal. It was non-conductive, non-magnetic and non-reflective.

==Components==
The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
