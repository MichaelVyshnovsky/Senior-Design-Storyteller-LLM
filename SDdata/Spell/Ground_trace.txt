'''''Ground trace''''' was a [[divine]] [[divination]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to trace the pathways of certain objects or passageways that descended beneath the ground. It was used by priests devoted to [[Mielikki]] and to [[Gwaeron Windstrom]].

==Effects==
In order to be cast, the caster selected a feature that, while visible from ground level, continued beneath the earth. The object targeted by the spell could be nearly anything, including a tree and its root system, a keep with a dungeon, a system of underground water pipes, ''etc''. ''Ground trace'' allowed the caster to discern the pathway of the subterranean passageway in their mind without descending underground.

The amount of knowledge the caster gained about a pathway was limited to how far they could travel its path above ground before the end of the spell's duration (a matter of minutes according to the power of the caster).

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a single hair taken from the caster and a piece of string.

==History==
The specifications of this spell were inscribed within the holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]], ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''.
