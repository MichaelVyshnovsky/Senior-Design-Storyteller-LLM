Ward against undead was an abjuration and/or necromancy spell that protected an area against entry by the undead.
There were at least two versions of this spell an older one that could be cast at a distance, and a newer one that was centered on the spell caster at the time of casting. Both versions allowed an arcane spellcaster to ward a circular area with a radius of up to 10 ft (3 m) per experience level of the caster. Undead attempting to enter the warded area were rebuffed unless they could overcome the magic of this spell, which was just as likely as dodging or resisting a dragons breath. Undead already within the area of effect were not ejected, but could only move half as fast (unless they successfully resisted).
The entire area under the effect of this spell flickered with a faintly blue aura, similar to faerie fire. The older version rebuffed undead intruders for one minute before they could make another attempt to enter. The newer version lasted for 10 minutes between attempts (or until the spell ended). If an undead creature managed to enter the area by resisting the magic of this spell, it was unaffected by that particular instance of the spell forever. However, multiple wards against undead could be cast in the same overlapping area, and undead creatures had to resist all of them before gaining entry. Dispel magic could be used to end the ward prematurely, and required one dispel for one ward. The area of effect was stationary and the caster did not have to maintain concentration on the spell for it to be effective. There were no additional effects on combat, turning, movement, or spell casting while within the area of effect.
Both versions of this spell only required verbal and somatic components. No material components were necessary.
This spell was published in "Volos Guide to All Things Magical" and became generally known to the magical community.
