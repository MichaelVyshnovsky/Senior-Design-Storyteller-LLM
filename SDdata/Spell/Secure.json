        "mainbody": "'''''Secure''''' was an [[arcane]] [[alteration]] spell that protected a door, portal, or chest from being opened or passed through, although it could eventually be physically destroyed.",
        "Effects": "This spell prevented even the caster from opening a [[chest]] or passing through a door or portal that had been ''secured''. The only known means for removing this spell were by a successful ''[[dispel magic]]'', powerful spells such as ''[[limited wish]]'', or potent magic items like ''[[chimes of opening]]''. Otherwise, the object was impervious to fire, cold, electricity, and ''[[knock]]'', as well as spells that altered the material of the protected area, such as ''[[dig]]'', ''[[reduce]]'', ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'', and ''[[vanish]]''. Any attempt to place a ''[[Glyph of warding|glyph]]'', ''[[Explosive runes|rune]]'', or ''[[symbol]]'' on the ''secured'' object resulted in immediate triggering or detonation of those effects. If ''[[detect magic]]'' or similar divination spells are used, they would register strong alteration magic in the area protected by this spell.\n\nThis spell was permanent until dispelled and could be applied to one chest or an area up to {{SI|10|ft²|long=yes}} per level of the caster. In addition to its other protections, the object or area was impervious to physical damage for a number of minutes equal to the caster's level. After that, the object or area could be successfully damaged by physical force and eventually destroyed. ''Secure'' did not prevent dimension hopping, so a ''[[dimension door]]'' or similar movement spell could get through a protected door or portal, but, in the case of a portal, a dimensional traveler would not be taken to the portal's destination, merely to the other side of the portal.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required something small made of [[iron]] and a [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious gem]] of any type.",
        "History": "This spell was published in \"[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]\" and became generally known to the magical community.",
