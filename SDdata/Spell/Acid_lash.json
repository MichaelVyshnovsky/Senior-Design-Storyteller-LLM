        "mainbody": "Acid lash was an offensive wizard spell.\nThis spell created a dangerous line of magical corrosive power that projected from one of the casters hands. The line always pointed straight from the casters hand as if they were holding a lance. The line was  in length but was not a solid object. The line would rebound in a random direction from a solid object that restricted its full length. The caster was in no danger of being harmed by their own acid lash spell.\nThe caster could sweep the area in front of them with the acid lash. The lash would bend around any solid objects it was pulled through to get around them. As the caster could not be harmed by their own lash, this spell was very effective in tight confines against enemies where its corrosive effects could easily reach targets.\nWhile the caster had an acid lash deployed, they could not wield anything in their other hand larger than a dagger. Spells requiring somatic components were also impossible to cast. The acid lash could be banished at any time by the caster.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required three drops of an acidic liquid to cast."
