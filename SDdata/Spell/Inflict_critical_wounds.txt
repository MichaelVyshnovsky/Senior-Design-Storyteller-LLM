Inflict critical wounds, also known as cause critical wounds, was a necromancy spell that caused extreme damage to a creature touched by the caster.
When this spell was cast, the caster channeled negative energy which did harm to living beings. Since undead were powered by negative energy, this spell cured them of a like amount of damage, rather than harming them.
The reverse of this spell, cure serious wounds, channeled positive energy and had the exact opposite effect (healed the living, harmed the undead).
