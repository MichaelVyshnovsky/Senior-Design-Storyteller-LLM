        "mainbody": "'''''Mending''''' was an [[arcane magic]] spell that repaired a single break or tear in an object. There was a [[divine magic]] version that was granted to priests of [[Dugmaren Brightmantle]].",
        "Effects": "The spell could repair up to {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} of damage in an object, leaving no trace of the break or tear. It could also repair [[spelljammer]] hulls. Although the spell could repair [[magic item]]s and [[construct]]s, it was not capable of restoring magic to them.\n\nThe divine version of ''mending'' could repair one object of about {{SIAdj|1|cu ft|long=yes}} in volume (bigger objects were possible for more experienced casters). Metal objects, like a [[ring]] or a [[dagger]], could be fixed if they had only one break. Objects with multiple cuts, breaks, or pieces could only be repaired if they were made of lesser materials such as wood or [[ceramic]]. Repairs were permanent and \"good as new\", and could not be dispelled after ten minutes had past. Like the arcane version, this spell could not repair magic items.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]] and [[material component]]s to cast. Two [[lodestone]]s were required as materials. The material component for the divine version of the spell, as well as older iterations of the arcane version, was either two small magnets (typically [[lodestone]]s) or two burrs.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Aksa]] the Destroyer in {{Yearlink|-2168}} and was originally called ''Aksa's repair''."
