'''''Noise''''' was a minor [[illusion]] [[cantrip]] that apprentice [[illusionist]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It generated an illusory but unintelligible sound of whatever the caster desired and could vaguely imitate.

==Effects==
The target of this spell had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster and the area of effect was a circle {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in diameter centered on the target point. All hearing creatures in the area had a chance to resist the spell and, if successful, heard nothing out of the ordinary. This cantrip could not imitate intelligible speech. Examples of the use of ''noise'' included the susurration of voices behind a door, the whoosh of wings or wind, the murmuring of a brook, or the scuff of feet or objects being moved.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster pointed at the desired center of the illusion and subvocalized an imitation of the desired noise.
