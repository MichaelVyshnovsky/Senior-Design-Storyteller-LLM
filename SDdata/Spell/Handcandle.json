        "mainbody": "'''''Handcandle''''' was a [[divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed a caster to conjure a red or white flame within their hand.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell manifested one of two types of light within the [[cleric]]'s open palm. The red flame was incendiary and damaging, in a manner similar to the spell ''[[produce flame]]''. The white flame was non-harmful and often used to simply illuminate a given area.\n\nNeither of the ''handcandle'' flames could be extinguished by strong gusts of air, even if they were magical in nature.",
        "History": "The specifications of this spell could be revealed upon a surface by the [[Oghma]]n [[relic]], the ''[[Key of Faith]]''.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast."
