        "mainbody": "Sense treason was a common spell used by ninjas. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the spell allowed the caster to determine if their clan or family had been intentionally betrayed. The identity of the traitor or the exact details of the betrayal remained unknown to the caster. Since the spell had no range limits, the spell was not always accurate. The spell was most often used by the shinobi advisors of clan leaders.\nThe spell required only a somatic component, kuji-kiri hand gestures."
