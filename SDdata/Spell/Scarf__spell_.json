        "mainbody": "Scarf was a common spell used by geisha. The spell was sometimes used by wu jen and was extremely rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThis spell was used for entertainment and spying. The spell caused a number of scarves to vanish into a sort of magical limbo. The scarves remained in this limbo for up to a day after a day, they automatically re-appeared. Geisha used this spell to magically pull scarves around them or from pockets or robes of their audience. The spell was also used to hide secret messages pinned to a scarf.\nThe spell required somatic and material components."
