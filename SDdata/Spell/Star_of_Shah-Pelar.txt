The'''Star of Shah-Pelar''' was one of five [[Star gem of Martek|Star Gems of Martek]] that the wizard [[Martek]] was said to have imbued with an enchantment to retrieve his Sphere of Power, but would actually resurrect him.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|4}}

==Description==
The Star of Shah-Pelar was a huge faceted [[ruby]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|84}}

==Powers==
Inside the [[Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak]], the Star of Shah-Pelar formed a keystone of its own defenses, as its facets reflected deadly rays throughout its room.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|85}}

The gem might also have been able to generate an effect akin to ''[[cure serious wounds]]'' thrice a day.These properties are not referenced in the [[Desert of Desolation]] module. This article assumes the gems are intended to be analogue to the ones in the core module.

==History==
The wizard [[Martek]] had given the Star of Shah-Pelar to an unnamed pharaoh of the desert, from whom it was stolen by [[Badr Al-Mosak]]. The thief later would have the gem interred with him in [[Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak|his crypt]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|5}} Adventurers recovered the gem in {{yearlink|1356}}, using it to restore Martek to life.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|126}}
