        "mainbody": "'''''Accuracy''''' was an offensive type of [[giant]] rune.",
        "Effects": "When affected by this rune, missile [[weapon]]s had a higher chance of reaching their target. If this rune was extensively studied a second time, then this effect would be even greater.",
        "Components": "Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast. The process of shaping this rune generally took around ten to forty minutes and it needed to be inscribed upon a missile, such as an ''arrow'' or ''[[javelin]]''."
