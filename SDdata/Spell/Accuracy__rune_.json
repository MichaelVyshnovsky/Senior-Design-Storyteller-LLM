        "mainbody": "ccuracy was an offensive type of giant rune.\nWhen affected by this rune, missile weapons had a higher chance of reaching their target. If this rune was extensively studied a second time, then this effect would be even greater.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast. The process of shaping this rune generally took around ten to forty minutes and it needed to be inscribed upon a missile, such as an arrow or javelin."
