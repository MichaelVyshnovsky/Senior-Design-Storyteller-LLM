        "mainbody": "Shield, originally called General Maticks shield, was a relatively simple abjuration spell used by sorcerers, wizards, witch doctors, and wu jen. The spell blocks all magic missiles, originally called General Maticks missile.\nOriginally, the spell produced an invisible barrier in front of the caster that would block all magic missiles and provide varying levels of protection against physical missiles, from arrows to javelins to manticore spikes, and against other attacks, as well as help them evade harmful effects coming from in front of them. While the shield could move somewhat to block an incoming strike, it could only stay in front of the caster. It lasted 50 minutes.\nFollowing the , the mage created an invisible disk of force, similar in size and function to a tower shield but with none of its cumbersomeness. It hovered in front of the caster and moved with them. Since it was formed from force, it protected even against the touch of incorporeal creatures like ghosts. However, the caster could took not take cover behind it. It lasted a number of minutes according to the power of the caster.\nPost-Spellplague, as well as postâ€“Second Sundering, a mage could cast shield as a reaction, quickly putting up their hand in response to an incoming attack and manifesting a shield of magical force around them, thus deflecting attacks and helping them evade harmful effects, including magic missiles.\nThe spell had somatic and verbal components. The sorcerer Simon cast a version with a powder material component and the words obscrus moyfin.\nAccording to the tome known as the Book of the Silver Talon, the ink ingredients used to inscribe shield into spellbooks were  of giant octopus ink, one clipped thumbnail, a pinch of iron filings, a powdered piece of rock crystal, a pebble, a beryl, and a star sapphire. The rock crystal, beryl, star sapphire and pebble were each individually crushed in a dwarf-forged mortar and burnt to ash with the thumbnail. The ink was heated, but not boiled, to which was added the components in the following order pebble dust, iron filings, rock crystal dust, beryl dust and star sapphire dust. It was stirred until dissolved and completely mixed, and then the thumbnail ash was added. It was then cooled until the fire dissipated.\nThe spell was introduced by the Netherese arcanist and warrior General Matick in  of the Golden Age of Netheril, but many scholars believed that he had only commissioned its invention.\nIn the late 1490s DR, the wild magic sorcerer Simon Aumar tried to cast shield to protect himself from his own angry audience in the Triboar playhouse. However, his spell miscast several times, becoming reverse gravity and throwing them all from the floor to the ceiling and back. He later used shield much more successfully against a meteor swarm hurled by Sofina, saving himself and his companions."
