        "mainbody": "'''''Shield''''', originally called '''''General Matick's shield''''', was a relatively simple [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s, [[wizard]]s, [[witch doctor]]s, and [[wu jen]]. The spell blocks all ''[[Magic missile|magic missiles]]'', originally called ''General Matick's missile''.",
        "Effects": "Originally, the spell produced an invisible barrier in front of the caster that would block all ''[[magic missile]]s'' and provide varying levels of protection against physical missiles, from [[arrow]]s to [[javelin]]s to [[manticore]] spikes, and against other attacks, as well as help them evade harmful effects coming from in front of them. While the shield could move somewhat to block an incoming strike, it could only stay in front of the caster. It lasted 50 minutes.\n\nFollowing the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the mage created an invisible disk of force, similar in size and function to a [[tower shield]] but with none of its cumbersomeness. It hovered in front of the caster and moved with them. Since it was formed from force, it protected even against the touch of [[incorporeal]] creatures like [[ghost]]s. However, the caster could took not take cover behind it. It lasted a number of minutes according to the power of the caster.\n\nPost-[[Spellplague]], as well as postâ€“[[Second Sundering]], a mage could cast ''shield'' as a reaction, quickly putting up their hand in response to an incoming attack and manifesting a shield of magical force around them, thus deflecting attacks and helping them evade harmful effects, including ''magic missiles''.",
        "Components": {
            "Inscription": "According to the tome known as the ''[[Book of the Silver Talon]]'', the [[ink|ink ingredients]] used to inscribe ''shield'' into [[spellbook]]s were: {{SI|1|oz|long=yes}} of [[giant octopus]] ink, one clipped thumbnail, a pinch of [[iron]] filings, a powdered piece of [[rock crystal]], a pebble, a [[beryl]], and a [[star sapphire]]. The rock crystal, beryl, star sapphire and pebble were each individually crushed in a [[dwarf]]-forged mortar and burnt to ash with the thumbnail. The ink was heated, but not boiled, to which was added the components in the following order: pebble dust, iron filings, rock crystal dust, beryl dust and star sapphire dust. It was stirred until dissolved and completely mixed, and then the thumbnail ash was added. It was then cooled until the fire dissipated."
        },
        "History": "The spell was introduced by the [[Netherese arcanist]] and [[Fighter|warrior]] [[Matick|General Matick]] in {{YearlinkConvert|2279|NY}} of the [[Golden Age of Netheril]], but many scholars believed that he had only commissioned its invention.\n\nIn the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} the [[wild magic]] [[sorcerer]] [[Simon Aumar]] tried to cast ''shield'' to protect himself from his own angry audience in the [[Triboar playhouse]]. However, his spell miscast several times, becoming ''[[reverse gravity]]'' and throwing them all from the floor to the ceiling and back.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} He later used ''shield'' much more successfully against a ''[[meteor swarm]]'' hurled by [[Sofina]], saving himself and his companions."
