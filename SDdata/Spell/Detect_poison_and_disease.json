        "Effect": "Upon casting this spell, the caster could sense disease, poisons, and poisonous creatures within a 30 ft (9.1 m) radius and know their location and type (''e.g.'', rabies, [[yellow mold]], or [[snake]]). This ability lasted while the caster concentrated on the detection, or for 10 minutes, whichever was less.\n\nThis spell could successfully detect poison or disease through barriers, but could not penetrate 3 ft (91 cm) of wood or dirt, 1 ft (30 cm) of stone, 1 in (2.5 cm) of regular metals, or a thin layer of lead.\n\n''Detect poison and disease'' could also be cast as a [[ritual]].",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a [[yew]] leaf to cast."
