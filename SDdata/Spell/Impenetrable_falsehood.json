        "mainbody": "Impenetrable falsehood was a divine magic spell available to mistcallers (specialty priests of Leira, the Guardian of Liars) and perhaps other priests with an affinity for divination and lies.\nThis spell could be cast on oneself or another person that was successfully touched as part of the casting. For the next twelve hours, the target of impenetrable falsehood was protected from detect lies, ESP, and psionic methods and similar abilities or magics to detect falsehood, and even the lie-detecting perception of holy justices of Tyr. Furthermore, it gave any false statement a ring of truth to the listener.\nThe spell did not block possible mind-reading but rather hid the targets true thoughts behind two or three innocuous thought patterns chosen by the caster. For example, someone eavesdropping in the targets mind would detect thoughts about crop yields next season, an attempt to recall the name of a person met years ago, or worry about a relative with a wasting disease.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast. Casting on a target person required touching that person."
