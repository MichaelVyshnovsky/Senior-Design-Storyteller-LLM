        "mainbody": "'''''Impenetrable falsehood''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to mistcallers ([[specialty priest]]s of [[Leira]], the Guardian of Liars) and perhaps other priests with an affinity for [[divination]] and lies.",
        "Effects": "This spell could be cast on oneself or another person that was successfully touched as part of the casting. For the next twelve hours, the target of ''impenetrable falsehood'' was protected from ''[[detect lies]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', and [[psionic]] methods and similar abilities or magics to detect falsehood, and even the lie-detecting perception of holy justices of [[Tyr]]. Furthermore, it gave any false statement a ring of truth to the listener.\n\nThe spell did not block possible mind-reading but rather hid the target's true thoughts behind two or three innocuous thought patterns chosen by the caster. For example, someone eavesdropping in the target's mind would detect thoughts about crop yields next season, an attempt to recall the name of a person met years ago, or worry about a relative with a wasting disease.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. Casting on a target person required touching that person."
