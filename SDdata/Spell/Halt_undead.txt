Halt undead was a type of arcane and divine spell that immobilized undead.
When cast, it affected up to three individual undead creatures, stopping them in their steps as if affected by the paralyze spell. The less intelligent undead creatures were, the less likely they were to resist the halt undead spell. Non-intelligent monsters such as zombies and skeletons could never resist the spell.
Halt undead affected undead within  from the caster (with a longer distance when used by more powerful spellcasters), and the affected creatures could not be more than  away from each other. The spell lasted for 10 minutes or until the halted creature was attacked or harmed in any way.
The halt undead spell required verbal, somatic, and material components to be cast. The spells material component was a pinch of sulphur and powdered garlic.
