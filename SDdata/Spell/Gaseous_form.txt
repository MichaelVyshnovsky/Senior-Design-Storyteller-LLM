'''''Gaseous form''''' or '''''wraithform''''' (originally called '''''Quantoul's wraithmorph''''' several types of [[genie]],, and [[vampire]]s) to take on an insubstantial, misty form. and to [[druid]]s who were members of the [[Underdark circle]].

==Effects==
The subject of the spell and all his or her possessions, upon being touched, were converted into a translucent cloud of gas.

It was very hard to physically damage a creature in gaseous form without the use of magic weapons. It was also challenging to recognize that a gaseous form was not just a simple mist.

The effect of the spell would last ten minutes or longer.

The spell usually only worked on a creature; however, it also could be used to convert a [[star ruby]] into a cloud of red vapor that had special healing powers, provided that the gem had been "unlocked" first with a ''[[knock]]'' spell.

==Components==
To cast this spell required [[somatic component]]s, a bit of gauze, and a wisp of smoke.

==History==
The spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Quantoul]] in {{Yearlink|-2019}} as one of his many investigations into the [[variator]] arts.

The god [[Shaundakul]] gave his worshipers a gaseous form until dusk each year on the holiday of [[Windride]], which was celebrated on [[Tarsakh 15]].
