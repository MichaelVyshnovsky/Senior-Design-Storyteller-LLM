        "mainbody": "Trobriands glassee was an arcane transmutation spell that made an object as transparent as glass.\nThe casters skill determined the size of the object that could be affected. The effects of Trobriands glassee were permanent once the spell was cast.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a sliver of glass to cast.\nThis spell was developed by Trobriand of Waterdeep."
