        "mainbody": "'''''Resplendence of renewed youth''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Tyr]], enabling them to renew the vigor of their youth.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the target to renew the strength of the peak of their physical fitness as a youth by tapping into their spiritual strength. The body of a [[human]] target would transform back to how it looked when they were 25 years old. The spell also granted complete immunity to all diseases for its duration of one year.\n\nThis spell would only work on individuals who led pious lives, and still only when their current goal or focus could not be completed in their current body. A ''[[quest]]'' spell needed to first be cast upon the target before casting ''resplendence of renewed youth'', and dropping the ''quest'' would automatically forfeit the new body. This spell could only be cast once upon a target. The recipient's body would not only return to its previous state when the spell ended, but they would also age an additional 4â€“13 years.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast."
