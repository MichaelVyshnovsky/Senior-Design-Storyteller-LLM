        "mainbody": "Detect drow was a divine divination spell from the divination sphere that alerted the caster to the presence of drow.\nThis spell informed the caster if drow were present in the direction they faced, letting them know the precise number of drow and sometimes the nature of their skills. The spell was blocked by solid stone, metal, or wood surfaces.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the priests holy symbol to cast.\nThis spell was granted dwarf priests of Shevarash, and gnome priests of Callarduran Smoothhands."
