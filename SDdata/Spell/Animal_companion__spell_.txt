Animal companion was a common spell used by shugenja and wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
This spell was similar to animal friendship. The spell summoned a single animal within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from the caster. The type of animal summoned depended on both the terrain and the skill level of the caster. The animal was friendly and traveled with the caster, up to 20 miles (32 kilometers) from its home. The animal would not follow a caster into a settlement. If the caster mistreated the animal, it would either leave or attack the caster. 
Minimal communication was possible between the animal and caster via spoken words or hand signals. The animal could misinterpret the caster and could perceive a normal situation as a threat. The animal companion would defend the caster if the caster was attacked. This defense was based on the animals natural abilities.   
Animals commonly summoned were badgers, bears, boars, hawks, serpents, and tigers.   
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a piece of candy or a food item sweetened with sugar.
