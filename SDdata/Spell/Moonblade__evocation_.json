        "mainbody": "Moonblade was an evocation spell that granted the caster a witless blade of pure moonlight.\nWhen conjured, a moonblade appeared to be a weightless and silent  construct made of moonlight. This ghostly blade was as dangerous as an enchanted +4 sword. But unlike a real weapon, an insubstantial moonblade was easy to wield, and the wielders muscles did not affect its deadlines. Each slash with this moonlight weapon dealt damage and drained the targets vitality both were doubled when used against undead creatures. Those who were damaged by a moonblade also temporarily lost the ability to cast spells due to its magic-scrambling properties.\nOnce created, a moonblade existed for only two minutes in the casters hand."
