        "Effects": "When conjured, a ''moonblade'' appeared to be a weightless and silent {{SI|4'|'\"|long=yes}} construct made of moonlight. This ghostly blade was as dangerous as an [[enchanted]] ''+4'' [[sword]]. But unlike a real weapon, an insubstantial ''moonblade'' was easy to wield, and the wielder's muscles did not affect its deadlines. Each slash with this moonlight weapon dealt damage and drained the target's vitality; both were doubled when used against [[undead]] creatures. Those who were damaged by a ''moonblade'' also temporarily lost the ability to cast spells due to its magic-scrambling properties.\n\nOnce created, a ''moonblade'' existed for only two minutes in the caster's hand."
