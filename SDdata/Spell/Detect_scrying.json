        "mainbody": "'''''Detect scrying''''' was a [[divination]] spell that alerted the caster to eavesdropping via other [[magic]].",
        "Effect": "The caster instantly became aware of any observation of them via a [[scrying]] divination, including ''[[crystal ball]]s'' and other devices. They could determine the positions of every magical sensor within an area up to 40 feet (12 meters) from them, moving as they did. If the source of the scrying began within that area, the caster also automatically determined its location, while outside that area, it was a contest as to who was the better spellcaster to see if they determined the source of not. If successful, or at least equal, the caster of ''detect scrying'' might receive a vision of the scrier and an accurate understanding of their distance and direction. ''Detect scrying'' lasted a full day.\n\nWhen ''detect scrying'' uncovered a spell, a brilliant blue-white flash would burn in the area.",
        "Components": "As well as [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, it required [[material component]]s: a small piece of [[mirror]] and a miniature [[brass]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_trumpet hearing trumpet].",
        "History": "This spell was invented by the prolific [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Trebbe]] in {{Yearlink|-2239}} and called '''''Trebbe's scry scrying'''''.<ref>"
