Eldritch speed is a transmutation spell used by several inexperienced swordmages. When it is cast, eldritch speed allows a swordmage to infuse their body with magical power, quickening both their mental and physical reactive capability. Swordmages enhanced by the eldritch speed react to danger more quickly and can run twice as fast. Eldritch speed is a difficult spell, however, and can only be cast once per day.
