        "mainbody": "Magic missile, dukar seeker was a unique adaptation of the traditional magic missile spell.\nWhen cast, this spell generated up to five ethereal missiles that sprung forth from the casters fingertip, precisely homing in on their intended target. Each missile inflicted damage similar to the standard magic missile spell. However, what sets this variant apart is its distinct focus on targeting Dukars.\nIf there were Dukars within the spells range, the magical missiles prioritized seeking them out over any other potential targets. In the event that the caster designated a non-Dukar as the target while one or more Dukars were within range, the missiles automatically redirected themselves towards the closest available Dukar within range. Conversely, if the caster specifically selected one or more Dukars as targets within range, the missiles unerringly flew towards the designated Dukar(s), regardless of proximity to other potential Dukar targets.\nUpon impact, these specialized missiles delivered additional damage when striking a Dukar. The extra damage inflicted increased incrementally with each subsequent missile hitting the target.\nThis spell only required a verbal component."
