Mind spike was a divination spell that reached another creatures mind, both damaging it and revealing information about it to the caster.
The spell probed the mind of a visible creature within a range of , inflicting damage to it. Moreover, if the target did not resist the spells effects, the creatures location became known to the caster for up to 1 minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating and as long as both creatures were located in the same plane of existence.
The spell only required a somatic component.
