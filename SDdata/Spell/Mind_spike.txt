'''''Mind spike''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] that reached another creature's mind, both damaging it and revealing information about it to the caster.

==Effects==
The spell probed the mind of a visible creature within a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}, inflicting damage to it. Moreover, if the target did not resist the spell's effects, the creature's location became known to the caster for up to 1 minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating and as long as both creatures were located in the same [[plane of existence]].

==Components==
The spell only required a [[somatic component]].
