        "mainbody": "'''Krynnspace''' was the [[crystal sphere]] that contained the planet [[Krynn]] and the other planets of its system.",
        "Location": "Krynnspace was part of a triangular configuration in the flow of the [[phlogiston]] that also included Realmspace and [[Greyspace]]. The flow allowed one-way [[spelljammer]] travel from Krynnspace to Realmspace, as well as one-way travel from Greyspace to Krynnspace.",
        "The Solar System": "The sphere included at least three planets besides Krynn that were known to some people from Realmspace:\n* '''Chislev''': the fourth planet from this sphere's sun and the least populous in terms of [[human]] and [[demihuman]] life. It was visited by explorers from [[Shou Lung]], who classified it as a [[live world]].<ref name=KS2e-p43\">\n* '''Sirion''': a fiery planet that was the closest to this sphere's sun. It was occasionally inhabited by [[azer]] and [[efreet]], who would sell [[basalt]] sculptures to spelljamming visitors that fetched a high price on [[Toril]].<ref name=KS2e-p11-13\">\n* '''Ziviliyn''': the fifth planet from this sphere's sun, this was an [[air body]] that was surrounded by twelve moons. One of these moons, known as Morgion, was often visited to collect the plants that grew on it. These fetched a high price on Toril.<ref name=KS2e-p49-52\">",
        "The Crystal Shell": "The crystal shell of Krynnspace was significantly larger than that of Realmspace, having a diameter of {{SI|8000000000|miles|k}}. The [[wildspace]] of this sphere was also much colder than that of Realmspace, with clouds of freezing vapor often being found in orbit around planets.\n\nMuch like Realmspace, this sphere had a number of small [[gate|portal]]s to the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Radiance]] that were seen by inhabitants as stars and constellations, which [[cleric]]s in Krynn's past determined represented each of their world's major deities.<ref name=KS2e-p4\"> And that the actions of the gods cause them to disappear, rearrange themselves, or often appear in new patterns.",
        "Trade": "The [[Crimson Caravan]] trading company made frequent trips between Realmspace, Greyspace, and Krynnspace, transporting goods from those spheres.<ref name=KS2e-p69-70\">",
        "History": "In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], travelers from Realmspace had spread knowledge of deities such as [[Malar]], [[Torm]], and [[Tyr]] into Krynnspace. In particular, the gods and customs of [[Kara-Tur]] were met with interest by local inhabitants.<ref name=KS2e-p83\">",
        "Inhabitants": "A number of inhabitants of Krynnspace traveled to Realmspace on occasion. Notable inhabitants included:\n\n* [[Emilo Haversack]], a [[kender]] from Krynn.\n* [[Jasmine]], winged member of [[Finder's Band]].<ref>\n* [[Tempest Ruse]], a pirate captain who lived briefly on [[Toril]] in the mid-14{{th}} century DR.<ref name=KS2e-p33-34\">\n* [[Teldin Moore]], a farmer from Krynn who traveled to Realmspace aboard a [[gnomish sidewheeler]] in the mid-14{{th}} century DR."
