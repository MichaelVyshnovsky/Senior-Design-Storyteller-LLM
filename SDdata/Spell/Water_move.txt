Water move was a spell unique to Maztica.
A caster used this spell to redirect the flow of moving water, even against the force of gravity. It could only be cast on water that was enclosed, such as in a cave or a pipe, it could not be cast on a river or stream in the open. Water flowed in the desired direction for as long as the spell was in effect. If a water source was connected, such as a pool, the water flowed in the modified direction indefinitely. This spell was often used to provide water to houses located at the higher elevations of a village.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component a foot from either a duck or goose.
