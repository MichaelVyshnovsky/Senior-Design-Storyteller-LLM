        "mainbody": "'''''Aegis of shielding''''' was a basic magical warding power of of [[Swordmage#Shielding Swordmage|shielding]] [[swordmage]]s.",
        "Effects": "When a swordmage cast ''aegis of shielding'', they forged a magical link between themselves and a single foe within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}. When the foe attacked an ally of the swordmage, the link hampered their efforts, making their strikes less effectual. If the enemy succeeded in their attack, the swordmage could use the link to create a magical shield between the enemy and their ally, substantially reducing the deadliness of the attack."
