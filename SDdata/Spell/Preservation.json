        "mainbody": "Preservation was an alteration/necromancy spell that preserved uncooked food or meat.\nBy casting this spell, a mage maintained food or meat in a state of relative freshness. In the case of animal flesh, it was kept as if creature had just recently been killed.\nThis spell could be used to prevent the decay of a humanoid body, in preparation for the individual to be resurrected (in a manner similar to gentle repose). If cast on a zombie, lich or similar undead being, it prevented further decay of their body.\nThis spell required verbal, somatic and material components in its casting, the latter of which was a single pinch of salt."
