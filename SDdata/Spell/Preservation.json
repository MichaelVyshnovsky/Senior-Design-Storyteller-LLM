        "mainbody": "'''''Preservation''''' was an [[alteration]]/[[necromancy]] [[spell]] that preserved uncooked food or meat.",
        "Effects": "By casting this spell, a [[mage]] maintained food or meat in a state of relative freshness. In the case of animal flesh, it was kept as if creature had just recently been killed.",
        "Usage": "This spell could be used to prevent the decay of a [[humanoid]] body, in preparation for the individual to be ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]'' (in a manner similar to ''[[gentle repose]]''). If cast on a [[zombie]], [[lich]] or similar [[undead]] being, it prevented further decay of their body.",
        "Casting": "This spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]] and material components in its casting, the latter of which was a single pinch of salt."
