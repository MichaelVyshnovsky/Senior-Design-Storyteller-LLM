        "mainbody": "Heat mirage was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell enhanced the deserts natural abilities to create mirages. If cast upon an area of the desert already creating a mirage, this spell added olfactory and auditory components to the mirage.\nHeat mirage was particularly useful for luring victims into an ambush. The mirage illusion was not dispelled until something actually tried to drink from the oasis, allowing bandits to hide in plain sight.\nThis spell did not require physical components to cast."
