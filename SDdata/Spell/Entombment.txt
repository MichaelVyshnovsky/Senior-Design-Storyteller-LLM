'''''Entombment''''' was an [[alteration]] and [[Elemental earth school|elemental earth]] [[spell]] from [[Zakhara]]'s ancient empire of [[Kadar]] designed to trap a creature or object in the ground. It had a reversed version called '''''exhume'''''.

==Effects==
''Entombment'' could cause the ground to swallow an object of limited size, or one creature that did not evade it quickly enough. The earth closed above the target so that its uppermost part was 10 feet (3 m) below ground level. A creature thus tightly enclosed would usually suffocate quickly if it was not rescued.

A wizard could use the reversed version, ''exhume'', to lift a creature or object out of the ground, provided its general nature was known and it lay no deeper than 10 feet (3 m).

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s only.

==History==
''Entombment'' was employed by the [[geomancers]] of the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdom]] of Kadar in eastern Zakhara. It was contained in the [[Kitab al-Asfr]], the spellbook penned by the geomancer [[Balshareska]], shortly before she achieved her goal to become Tisan, greatest (and last) holder of power within Kadar.

With the fall of the geomancers and the centuries-long imprisonment of Tisan, the spell was also lost. After her second defeat in [[1367 DR]],{{AQ-time}} the Kitab al-Asafr and the magic within began circulating again in the Land of Fate.
