The '''Cyrinishad''' was an unholy tome created by [[Rinda]] the Scribe under the forced divine guidance of [[Cyric]].

==Creation==
The tome was made for the sole purpose of increasing Cyric's power in [[Faer√ªn]]. After the [[Time of Troubles]], the power of a [[deity]] was directly related to the size and devotion of their worshipers.

The tome would turn anyone who read it into a devout worshiper of Cyric and thus would increase Cyric's power. The tome was of great power and once one started reading it, could not willingly stop; it even worked against other deities. The final version of the Cyrinishad was the 398th version, and all the previous authors had suffered greatly for their failure to satisfy Cyric.

==Appearance==
The book was made of raven-black leather, and was embossed with a pattern of small grinning skulls and sunbursts against a twisting, warped background of torture and chaos. The book had [[gold]]en hinges and clasps, and it was closed with a lock of unbreakable metal.

A skull the size of a child's fist dominated the front cover. The skull was animated by Rinda's blood and acted as the guardian of the book, which prevented it from being destroyed or removed from the mortal realms.

==History==
After [[Mask]] managed to trick Cyric into leaving the book in his hands, it was given to Rinda the Scribe for safekeeping, where it was protected and concealed by [[Oghma]]. Later, [[Gwydion|Gwydion the Quick]] joined Rinda as guardian of the book.

At one point, Cyric himself made the grave mistake of reading from the book. Though it was his own creation, he proved no more immune to its power than any other. The book instilled an unshakable belief in his own omnipotence and supremacy over the cosmos, instilling megalomania and even a degree of outright solipsism to his already fractured mind.

|I knew at once that my foes meant to drop the ''Cyrinishad'' into one of the boiling cesspools below their latrines, where no mortal could venture and no [[immortal]] would.

Malik was unsuccessful in his quest to obtain the holy ''Cyrinishad''. The follower of Cyric heard the holy tome hissing aggressively in his mind, and he detected an extremely bad scent. He immediately recognised that his enemies meant to throw the ''Cyrinishad'' down to the vile, lower levels of Candlekeep, where it could not be retrieved.
