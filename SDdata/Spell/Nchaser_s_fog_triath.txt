Nchasers fog triath, or NFT, was a spell, invented presumably by Nchaser, that conjured the image of a lord or other leader (that is, a [https//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/triath triath]). It was formed from fog but appeared quite solid. Moreover, it moved and signaled in time with the real triath, regardless of their separation, provided they remained on the same plane. The subject had to be a real leader who was familiar to the caster.
