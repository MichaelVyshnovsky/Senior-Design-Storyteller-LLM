Bolts of warding was a weapon-focused encounter prayer available to clerics during the post-Spellplague era.
When bolts of warding was cast a weapon being wielded by the cleric would temporarily crackle all along its surface with divine lightning. This lightning would arc out from the weapon and strike at any enemy that got up close to any allies that were within  of the caster.
Casting this spell required the cleric to be wielding a weapon.
In the , a party of four Daggerdalesmen adventurers were summoned to the mines of Tethyamar by the Banite priestess Lorin-Aria to kill the Zhent wizard Rezlus and put an end to his plans to conquer Daggerdale and the greater Dalelands region. Among this party of adventurers was a dwarf cleric who knew the prayer bolts of warding.
