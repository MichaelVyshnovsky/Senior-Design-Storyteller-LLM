        "mainbody": "'''''Alicorn lance''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] in which the priest could fire a [[unicorn]]'s horn, called an alicorn, at a foe. It was granted by [[Lurue]], the Unicorn Queen.",
        "Effects": "The spell created a silver, ethereal [[alicorn]] that floated above the brow of the caster. The caster had to fire the \"lance\" at a creature within {{SI|120|ft}}, before the spell ended, or the alicorn would be wasted. If the spell hit, it inflicted fair piercing damage, but dissipated if it missed. After hitting a creature, it would be limned in ''[[faerie fire]]'' of a silver hue, applying combat penalties to said opponent.",
        "Components": "As well as [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components, either a [[divine focus]], or a lock of a unicorn's mane and the priest's holy symbol were required."
