'''''Brain spider''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the schools of [[divination]] and [[enchantment]].

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to read the thoughts of up to eight targets at once and allowed them to dig around for specific information. Casters with more expertise were able to gather more information. The caster could only focus on thoughts from one target at a time. Additionally they could impart ''[[suggestion]]s'', as per the spell, to a single target at a time.

Any targets with [[psionic]] abilities, or those casting enchantment spells when the ''brain spider'' entered their minds, were aware of the intrusion and knew the caster's general location, unbeknownst to the caster. Insane and ''[[feeblemind]]ed'' targets could not be affected by this spell and the contact actually harmed the ''brain spider'' caster.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]] any type of spider to cast. The spider could be dead or alive but needed to have all eight legs.
