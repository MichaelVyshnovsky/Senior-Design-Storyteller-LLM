        "Effect": "The ''healing hand'' spell supplied additional healing to a creature that had already been healed within the previous 24 hours.

Any on these three people could be the same if required.\n\nA full 48 hours was required before another casting of ''healing hand'' could be applied.",
        "Components": "The spell required a scrap of skin and a sliver of bone, of any type, size, age, and species.",
        "History": "The ''healing hand'' spell appeared within the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', the holiest book of the [[church of Ilmater]], which first appeared in the Realms in [[848 DR]]."
