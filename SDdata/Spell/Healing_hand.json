        "mainbody": "Healing hand was a divine necromancy spell that boosted the healing provided by a previously cast healing spell.\nThe healing hand spell supplied additional healing to a creature that had already been healed within the previous 24 hours. If the intended recipient was not present, then the caster of healing hand could work with the caster of the previous healing spell, who concentrated on and visualized the recipient. Any on these three people could be the same if required.\nA full 48 hours was required before another casting of healing hand could be applied.\nThe spell required a scrap of skin and a sliver of bone, of any type, size, age, and species.\nThe healing hand spell appeared within the Tome of Torment, the holiest book of the church of Ilmater, which first appeared in the Realms in 848 DR."
