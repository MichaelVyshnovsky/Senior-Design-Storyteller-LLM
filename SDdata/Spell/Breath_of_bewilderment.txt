}}'''''Breath of bewilderment''''' was an offensive [[wizard]] [[spell]].

==Effects==
The caster of this spell could expel a cloud of smoking vapor from their mouth. The vapor covered an area measuring 10 feet high by 10 feet wide by 30 feet long. The cloud only remained for one minute before dissipating, but any living creature caught within the cloud was stunned and unable to function for the same period of time.

In addition to being immune to the effects of their own spell when cast, the caster was also unaffected by the spell when cast by anyone else if the spell was committed to memory.

==Components==
This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.
