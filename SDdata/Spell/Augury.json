        "mainbody": "Augury (|audio=augury.ogg) was a divination spell that told if a proposed action would have a positive or negative outcome.\nAfter the Second Sundering, the spell was altered little after casting a second time or more before a long rest the spell became about 25% more unreliable. When the wrong answer was to be given, the spell gave any one of the answers.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a set of marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens of at least 25 gp value. The shugenja version of this spell required a pair of straight sticks from a willow or carved bones."
