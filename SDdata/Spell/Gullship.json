        "mainbody": "Gullship was an elven wizard spell from the school of alteration.\nThis spell allowed a normal water vessel to fly. The duration of the spell, the size of the ship, and the height at which it could fly was limited by the skill of the caster. Regardless of the ships size, it still required wind to move about. The gullship moved through the air as it would on the sea based on the efforts of the crew, yet the only time the caster had to concentrate on the spell after casting was if a change in altitude was desired.\nThe ship would lower itself smoothly to the water when the spell ended regardless of the height.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a small model ship and a feather of a seagull to cast."
