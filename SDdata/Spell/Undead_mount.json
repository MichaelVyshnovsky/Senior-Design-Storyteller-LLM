        "mainbody": "'''Undead mount''' was a [[necromancy]] spell that animated a corpse or the bones of an animal big enough to carry the caster.",
        "Effects": "Possible mounts were dead [[horse]]s, [[mule]]s, [[camel]]s, [[oxen]], [[griffon]]s, [[hippogriff]]s, [[hippocampus|hippocampi]], and other beasts of burden. Formerly flying creatures could not fly again but could ambulate. An undead mount could carry riders and burdens up to {{SI|300|lb|k|long=yes}}.  An undead mount could not fight but moved quickly and silently, obeying the simplest of commands. The caster could choose to have the mount give off a faint blue, green, or yellow glow for extra eerieness.\n\nThe older version of this spell created undead mounts that could not be turned. The reanimations of the newer spell could be turned as skeletons if they were mostly bones or as zombies if they were mostly flesh. With a rider, the mount was only turned if the rider was successfully turned.",
        "Components": "This spell required the skeleton or corpse of a beast of burden, a bit of powdered hoof, a drop of water and a human hair in addition to the verbal and somatic components. The skeleton or corpse did not have to be whole, i.e., broken bones or crippled corpses would still work. However, attempting to create a mount from an insufficient amount of bones caused the spell to fizzle. Bones or limbs from other creatures could be substituted in order to form a complete mount."
