'''''Face''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
This spell was a combination of illusion and charm. When cast, it gave a wu jen the illusion of a higher social status. During casting, the wu jen decided which standing was increased, either social status, title, or office. The spell caused the wu jen to display higher levels of confidence and sophistication to those around them. The spell also gave the wu jen the appropriate mannerisms, aura of power, speech, and etiquette for the assumed position.  

The spell worked best on those who were unfamiliar with the assumed rank. They treated the wu jen with great respect and respected their authority. For those who were familiar with the assumed rank, there was a risk they would become suspicious and see through the illusion and charm and the spell would be rendered useless.  

The reverse of the spell was ''[[lose face]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a single drop of [[honey]].
