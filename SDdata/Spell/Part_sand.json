        "mainbody": "Part sand was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nWith this spell the caster could create a  trough through a mound of sand, loose dirt, gravel, etc. This spell could only be used on a mound sitting above level ground. It did not work against level ground, or depressions in the ground.\nOnce aimed, the spell created the trough in a straight line and the direction or angle of the cut could not be changed. The spells magic held loose debris from falling into the trough once created. Objects unearthed by this spell simply fell to the bottom of the trough.\nIf the trough met stone or other solid objects, then it would be blocked. This spell could also be used to harm any creature whose body was composed of earth.\nThis spell required a two small stones to cast."
