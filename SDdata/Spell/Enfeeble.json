        "mainbody": "Enfeeble was an uncommon necromatic spell of the southern magic tradition that weakened a target. \nThe target was rendered physically weaker and less agile. The range of the spell was very limited, requiring the caster to come into physical contact with the target after the spell was cast. The effects of the spell could be reduced using certain spells, such as limited wish, restoration, or wish.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, an essence of shadow."
