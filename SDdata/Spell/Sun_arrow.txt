'''''Sun arrow''''' was a type of offensive ''[[arcane]]'' [[spell]] from the southern nation of [[wizard]]s â€“ [[Halruaa]].

==Effects==
When summoned, the spell's energies formed a heated arrow of sunlight that spun towards its target. The ''sun arrow'' left charred and smoking burn wounds on its target but was not necessarily lethal but still agonizingly painful. Like with most other types of magic, Halruaan [[jordainis]] were trained to defend themselves from the ''sun arrow'' spell with a single smooth motion. However, there was a mundane method of countering the spell. A reflective surface, like a shard of glass, a [[mirror]], or a polished [[brass]] platter, reflected the spell and, with a skillful application, could be sent back onto its caster.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, a young talented spell-slinger [[Tzigone]], taught her jordaini ally [[Matteo (Halruaa)|Matteo]] to use reflective surfaces to harmlessly bounce ''sun arrow'' spells away. The skill he used to his master's, [[Procopio Septus]]' delight, to deflect magics back at the "assassin" sent for testing the young jordaini's skills. A simple use of a polished dish left the wizard rolling on the ground in agony and in need of a [[cleric]].
