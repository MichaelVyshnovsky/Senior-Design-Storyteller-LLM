        "mainbody": "Manythorns was a divine alteration spell that covered the casters body with thousands of small, spectral thorns.\nWhen cast, this spell conjured a great many thorns that emerged from the casters skin. These thorns were weightless and not made up of actual plant material. Additionally they were non-harmful to the caster, offered significant protection from physical attacks and damaged any unarmored individual with whom they came into close contact.\nThe specifications of this spell were inscribed within the relic known as the Leaves of Green.\nIn order to be cast, this spell required verbal and somatic components along with at least six thorns taken from any species of plant."
