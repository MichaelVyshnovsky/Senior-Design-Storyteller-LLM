'''''Create crypt servant''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was usable by [[wizard]]s and [[priest]]s ([[cleric]]s).

==Effects==
''Create crypt servant'' was used, similarly to the simpler ''[[animate dead]]'' spell, to reanimate the body of a deceased person as a special [[undead]] called a [[crypt servant]], that was especially suited to protect and maintain a designated tomb. The spell had to be performed at the burial place intended as the servant's domain in order to function. Apart from conventional means, a crypt servant could be destroyed by the reversed form of this spell, '''''destroy crypt servant''''',<ref group="note">The name and effect of the reversed form are not explicitely stated in the sources. or ''[[dispel magic]]''. The spell intended for the [[Crypt thing|even more powerful undead]], ''[[destroy crypt thing]]'', was also effective against a crypt servant.

==Components==
Apart from an intact corpse, this spell only needed verbal and somatic components.

==History==
This spell was originally employed in the ruined kingdoms of [[Kadar]] and [[Nog]].
