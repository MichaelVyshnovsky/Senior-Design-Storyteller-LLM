        "mainbody": "Mass reduce person was a spell that made the targets small.\nThe targets, which needed to be humanoids, became small. Their dimensions all halved in size, as did their equipment. This allowed them to become more agile at the cost of growing physically weaker.\nThe spell only required somatic, verbal, and material components. The needed material component was a pinch of powdered iron."
