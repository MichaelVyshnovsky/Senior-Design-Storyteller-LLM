        "mainbody": "'''''Mass reduce person''''' was a [[spell]] that made the targets small.",
        "Effects": "The targets, which needed to be [[humanoid]]s, became small. Their dimensions all halved in size, as did their equipment. This allowed them to become more agile at the cost of growing physically weaker.",
        "Components": "The spell only required somatic, verbal, and material components. The needed material component was a pinch of powdered [[iron]]."
