Vampiric touch was a necromancy spell that absorbed the life force of a living creature to heal the caster.
If the caster managed to hit and establish contact with another creature, the spell started siphoning life from the target and healing the caster. The ability to perform this life drain continued active for up to one minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating.
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Gwynn in  and was originally known as Gwynns vampirism.
