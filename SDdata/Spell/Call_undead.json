        "mainbody": "'''''Call undead''''' was a [[Necromancy|necromantic]] spell that allowed the caster to summon any nearby [[undead]] creature.",
        "Effects": "The caster was able to summon any undead within 100 yards (91 meters) in any direction, including above and below. Summoned undead outside of visual range of the caster were not able to automatically locate the caster.\n\nLesser undead within visual range would immediately move to the caster. Greater undead were not compelled by this spell.\n\nThe spell was effective through all non-magical barriers. It could not penetrate magical barriers, nor be used from one [[plane]] to another. The spell could be used to bring back any previously turned undead.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a piece of bone from any creature as a material component."
