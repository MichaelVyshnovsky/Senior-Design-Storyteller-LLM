        "mainbody": "Choose future was a divine divination spell from the time sphere that granted the target the best outcome for a situation.\nThe target of this spell was allowed to perform a single act twice and pick whichever act had the more desirable outcome. The chosen act would then become reality.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components two grains of sand and a rose petal to cast.\nThe Tome of Torment, a holy book of the Church of Ilmater, contained the spell choose future."
