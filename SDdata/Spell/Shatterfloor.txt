'''''Shatterfloor''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] that used sound to injure creatures and damage floors.

==Effects==
This spell could be cast at a point up to {{SI|130|ft|long=yes}} away (even farther for more experienced casters). Upon completion, the area within a {{SIAdj|15|ft|}} radius of the target suffered sonic damage from an extremely loud vibration that rose to a painful intensity and then faded away. Any creatures and objects in the area of effect were struck by the sound but could avoid some of the injury by an act of will. Floors made of stone, wood, ice, or anything softer were crumbled into gravely dust, wood chips, crushed ice, or the like, to a depth of {{SI|6|in|c|long=yes}}, making it difficult to walk.

==Components==
''Shatterfloor'' required [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[verbal]] components, as well as a [[spell focus|focus]] in the form of a miniature [[hammer]] and bell.
