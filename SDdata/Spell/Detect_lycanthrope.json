        "mainbody": "Detect lycanthrope  was a spell similar to detect shapechanger, but geared specifically towards lycanthropes.\nThis spell allowed the caster to sense the presence of all lycanthropes within its area, which could be a few miles in radius.\nInfected lycanthropes were more likely to evade the effects of this spell than natural lycanthropes. The caster was unable to tell which kind of lycanthropes were out there, or any information about them other than their location. Lycanthropes would be detected regardless of their current aspect. This spell was created by Avan Vatsisen and he was likely the only one to be able to use it.\nFor material components this spell required a balm of honey, a dried carrot, moonwort, and belladonna. The belladonna had to be rubbed into the casters eyelids."
