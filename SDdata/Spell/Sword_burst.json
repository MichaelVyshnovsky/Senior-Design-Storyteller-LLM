        "mainbody": "'''''Sword burst''''' is a very basic [[swordmage]] [[spell]], used frequently by [[Swordmage#Assault Swordmage|assault swordmage]]s as well as those of other styles. When a swordmage casts ''sword burst'' he or she causes a burst of invisible force with a blast area of five feet in diameter to surge outwards from his or her [[blade]], sweeping through the mage's enemies with deadly force. The strength of this attack, which is in part dependent upon the swordmage's intellect, grows as the swordmage becomes more experienced and worldly. ''Sword burst'' is among the most basic swordmage spells and can be cast at any time, recharging instantly.",
