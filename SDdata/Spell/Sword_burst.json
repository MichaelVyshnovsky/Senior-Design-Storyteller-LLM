        "mainbody": "Sword burst is a very basic swordmage spell, used frequently by assault swordmages as well as those of other styles. When a swordmage casts sword burst he or she causes a burst of invisible force with a blast area of five feet in diameter to surge outwards from his or her blade, sweeping through the mages enemies with deadly force. The strength of this attack, which is in part dependent upon the swordmages intellect, grows as the swordmage becomes more experienced and worldly. Sword burst is among the most basic swordmage spells and can be cast at any time, recharging instantly.\nCategorySorcerer spells\nCategorySwordmage spells\nCategoryWarlock spells\nCategoryWizard spells\niciwjjv09ni2rzvprb6u8579l9c0or2"
