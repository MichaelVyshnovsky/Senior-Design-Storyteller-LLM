Barrier was an abjuration spell of the southern magic tradition that allowed the caster to create a magical barrier.
The barrier was a magical wall that surrounded the caster with a radius of 10 ft (3 m). The wall would protect the caster against physical or magical attacks until the spell expired. The caster could not cast any spells that inflicted damage, or launch any physical attacks, through the wall. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component. A piece of jade or amethyst, worth at least 50 gp, was needed and would be consumed in the casting of the spell.
