        "mainbody": "'''''Catnap''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[bard]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[wizard]]s that calmed multiple creatures into a restorative sleep.",
        "Effects": "A caster used this spell on up to three willing creatures to render them unconscious for a short time. The target creatures had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster. After the spell expired, the creatures felt slightly rejuvenated, as if they had a short nap. If the creature was disturbed or hurt during the spell's duration, the spell expired and the creature regained consciousness. A caster could target more creatures at once with this spell; the amount of creatures was determined by the caster's skill level.",
        "Components": "In addition to a [[somatic component|somatic]] component, the spell required a [[material component]], a pinch of salt."
