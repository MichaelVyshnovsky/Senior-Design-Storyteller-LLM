        "mainbody": "Lightning bolt was an evocation spell that caused arcs of lightning to emanate from the casters fingertips.\nThe searing bolt of electricity traveled in a straight line emanating from the caster. Older versions of this spell struck all in its path, while newer versions were aimed at a particular creature and then, with skill, could be forked to hit one or two other creatures.\nThe bolt from the older versions was powerful enough to blast a wooden door to cinders, set fire to combustible materials, splinter a hand-depth of stone, or melt soft metals such as gold, silver, copper, lead, or bronze.\nA well-centered lightning bolt blast could interfere with magics of open gates, closing them after rippling through the fabric of the spell with electric feedback.\nThe pre-Spellplague and post-Second Sundering versions of this spell required verbal, somatic, and material components including a tuft of fur and a small rod made of amber, crystal, or glass.\nTo inscribe this spell on a magic scroll, arcane scribes often used ink made from the horn of a behir.\nThe spell was attributed to the Netherese arcanist Volhm in  and was originally called Volhms bolt.\nThe wizard Parwyyd Hanifar used a forked version of lightning bolt to blast a number of kenkus and gargoyles in aerial combat in 1357 DR.\nThe following year, during the Time of Troubles, a false avatar of Sel√ªne cast lightning bolt at Kyriani in the kitchen of Castle Waterdeep, but the bolts were caught and reflected by pots and pans.\nIn 1362 DR a harper wizard Brenna Graycloak was able to cast a version of a lightning bolt in a fray of battling a darkenbeast using sulfur as a component."
