'''''Wall of law''''' was a [[spell]] similar to ''[[magic circle against chaos]]''.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a spherical or linear barrier. One side of the barrier is designated as a safe zone by the caster. The barrier prevented chaotic creatures and their attacks from reaching the caster and anyone else on the other side of the barrier. The spell worked against conjured and summoned chaotic creatures. The barrier had to have enough space to be unbroken, if during casting a creature or object was in the way, the spell failed.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
