Stumble was a combat spell of the southern magic tradition that would cause a creature to lose their footing.
Unless resisted, this spell caused a target creature within  of the caster to continually trip and lose their balance until the spell expired.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a drop of oil as a material component.
