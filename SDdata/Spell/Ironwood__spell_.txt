'''''Ironwood''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] and [[bisan]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell made wood as strong as steel. The appearance and weight of the wood remained unchanged. The spell could be cast on a living plant, with a 50% chance of success. The plant's growth was unaffected but all parts of the plant, including leaves and flowers, became as steel. If cast on a plant-based creature, the spell paralyzed the creature. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s, metal filling and the sap of a willow tree.
