Bane was an enchantment spell that sapped enemy morale and reduced their combat effectiveness.
Those enemies cursed were inflicted with trepidation and doubt, lowering their morale and dulling their skill in combat.
Bane countered and dispelled bless and vice versa.
After Second Sundering, the bane and bless spells didnt counter and dispel each other but were opposites of each other.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components, and the casters (un)holy symbol or divine focus.
