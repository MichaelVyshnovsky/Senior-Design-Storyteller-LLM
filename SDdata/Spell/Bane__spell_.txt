'''''Bane''''' was an [[enchantment]] spell that sapped enemy morale and reduced their combat effectiveness.

==Effects==
Those enemies ''cursed'' were inflicted with trepidation and doubt, lowering their morale and dulling their skill in combat.

''Bane'' countered and dispelled ''[[bless]]'' and vice versa.

After [[Second Sundering]], the ''bane'' and ''bless'' spells didn't counter and dispel each other but were opposites of each other.

==Components==
This spell required only verbal and somatic components, and the caster's (un)[[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]].
