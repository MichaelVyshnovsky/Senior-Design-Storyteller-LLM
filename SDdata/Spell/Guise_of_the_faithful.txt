Guise of the Faithful was an ability a skulker of Vhaeraun could learn.
A skulker of Vhaeraun usually tried to avoid notice, owing to the illegality of their own existence in drow society, but also to do their work. Guise of the faithful was an ability to create a magical disguise for the skulker and another ally. This disguise managed to change how one and ones equipment felt, sounded, and looked but had the limitation of only allowing drow disguises. The entire illusion lasted for an hour or until dismissed. It was possible, though hard, to see through.
