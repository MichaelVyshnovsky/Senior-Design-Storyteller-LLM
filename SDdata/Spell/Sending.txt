Sending was an evocation spell that instantly transmitted a brief message to any destination.
The spellcaster made contact with a certain being he or she was familiar with and sent them a brief message of up to twenty-five words. If the recipient already knew the spellcaster, then they would recognize him or her. Afterward, the recipient could immediately respond with a similar message.
Even creatures with extremely low intelligence, like animals, could receive and comprehend the sending, but their ability to respond was limited to their capabilities.
The recipient was not obligated to act upon a sending in any manner.
If the intended recipient was located on a different plane to the sender, then there was a one-in-a-twenty chance that the sending would not be received. The local effects of the plane could make it more difficult still.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, sending required a short length of fine copper wire as a material component or divine focus.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Enollar in  and was originally called Enollars sending.
