'''''Sending''''' was an [[evocation]] spell that instantly transmitted a brief message to any destination.

==Effect==
The spellcaster made contact with a certain being he or she was familiar with and sent them a brief message of up to twenty-five words. If the recipient already knew the spellcaster, then they would recognize him or her. Afterward, the recipient could immediately respond with a similar message.

Even creatures with extremely low intelligence, like animals, could receive and comprehend the ''sending'', but their ability to respond was limited to their capabilities.

The recipient was not obligated to act upon a ''sending'' in any manner.

If the intended recipient was located on a different [[plane]] to the sender, then there was a one-in-a-twenty chance that the ''sending'' would not be received. The local effects of the plane could make it more difficult still.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, ''sending'' required a short length of fine [[copper]] [[wire]] as a [[material component]] or [[divine focus]].

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Enollar]] in {{Yearlink|-1593}} and was originally called '''''Enollar's sending'''''.
