'''''Animate weapon''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] [[spell]] from the [[combat sphere]] that imbued a single weapon with [[magic]] that made it fight on behalf of the caster.

==Effects==
The animated weapon would hover in the air and attack enemies of the caster, but it would not defend the caster by parrying. If the weapon sustained enough damage then it would simply drop to the ground undamaged and the spell would end. The caster could perform any action, with the exception of wielding a weapon, while the spell was active. Wielding a normal weapon caused the animated weapon to stop attacking.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] the [[priest]]'s [[holy symbol]] to cast.

==History==
''Animate weapon'' was granted to [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[cleric]]s by [[Moradin]].
