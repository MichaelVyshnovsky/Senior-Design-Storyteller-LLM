Animate weapon was a divine enchantment spell from the combat sphere that imbued a single weapon with magic that made it fight on behalf of the caster.
The animated weapon would hover in the air and attack enemies of the caster, but it would not defend the caster by parrying. If the weapon sustained enough damage then it would simply drop to the ground undamaged and the spell would end. The caster could perform any action, with the exception of wielding a weapon, while the spell was active. Wielding a normal weapon caused the animated weapon to stop attacking.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the priests holy symbol to cast.
Animate weapon was granted to dwarven clerics by Moradin.
