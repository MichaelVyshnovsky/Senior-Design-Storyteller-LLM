If the target couldnt muscle their way out of the vines, they would be trapped in them. The vines would last up to a minute and damaged the victim every couple of seconds. If the target was large, then it would more easily break the vines hold.\nIf the spell was cast with a higher spell level, then the vines would hurt more.\nOnly a verbal component was needed for the casting of this spell."
