        "mainbody": "'''''Ensnaring strike''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that gave a strike the chance of ensnaring a target with vines.",
        "Effects": "The target was covered with vines. If the target couldn't muscle their way out of the vines, they would be trapped in them. The vines would last up to a minute and damaged the victim every couple of seconds. If the target was large, then it would more easily break the vines' hold.\n\nIf the spell was cast with a higher spell level, then the vines would hurt more.",
        "Components": "Only a [[verbal component]] was needed for the casting of this spell."
