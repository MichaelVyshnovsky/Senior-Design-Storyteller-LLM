Cloud shape was an alteration spell, developed by the air elementalist Mortimer Lightfoot in the mid–14 century DR, that allowed one to manipulate the shape of clouds.
One or more clouds within a  radius could be manipulated by the caster into limitless number of shapes for an unlimited duration. The spell also allowed the caster to "stretch" clouds out to twice their original size and join multiple clouds together. The inherent nature of the cloud would be left unaffected.
In addition to requiring somatic and verbal components, cloud shape required a material component, which took the form of the cloud that was to be used by the spell.
In the mid–14 century DR, Mortimer Lightfoot and a group of other rogue elementalists known as the Circle of Four used cloud shape, alongside Mortimers other spell solid cloud, to create a sort of cloud palace that they used to imprison their kidnapped victims.
