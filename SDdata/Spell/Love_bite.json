        "mainbody": "Love bite was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Sune, enabling them to deliver a phantom kiss to a target.\nWhen this spell was cast the caster selected a target and kissed the air, allowing them to interact with a visible target in several ways. The caster could actually kiss the target, bite them, or affect them with another touch-based spell cast within three minutes before casting love bite.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
