'''''Burnish''''' was an [[alteration]]/[[abjuration]] [[spell]] that restored the natural luster and shine of metal, including the scales of [[metallic dragon]]s. The reverse of this spell was '''''tarnish''''', which covered metal in an unattractive patina that would normally be caused by extended oxidation.

==Effects==
For the duration of the spell, any affected metal objects, including [[Currency|coins]], [[weapon]]s, decorations and even [[dragon]] scales among others, were restored to their full, natural luster. Additionally during this time, their shine could no longer be diminished by normal means.

One casting of ''burnish'' could effect up to 1,000 lbs (0.5 MT) of any kind of metal including [[copper]], [[brass]], [[gold]], [[silver]] and [[bronze]]. Its duration lasted for a matter of days, depending on the skill and experience of the caster.

The reverse of the spell, ''tarnish'', actively dulled the shine of metal, covering it an unsightly film.

==Casting==
This spell required only [[verbal component]]s to be cast and was used primarily by dragons of [[Toril]].
