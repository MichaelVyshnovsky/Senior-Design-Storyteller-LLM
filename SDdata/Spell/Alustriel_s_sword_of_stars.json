        "mainbody": "Alustriels sword of stars was a wizard spell from the school of evocation created by Alustriel Silverhand.\nThis spell created a shimmering magical force that appeared as a large greatsword. The sword appeared a minute after the spell was cast, floating around to attack a chosen target. The sword attacked twice with each attempt at striking the target. The sword did not require the casters attention once assigned a target. A sword of stars was immune to all magic attempting to harm it.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a metal-bladed weapon to cast. The weapon was consumed during casting."
