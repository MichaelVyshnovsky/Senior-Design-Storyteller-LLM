        "Effects": "This spell created a shimmering magical force that appeared as a large [[greatsword]]. The sword appeared a minute after the spell was cast, floating around to attack a chosen target. The sword attacked twice with each attempt at striking the target. The sword did not require the caster's attention once assigned a target. A ''sword of stars'' was immune to all magic attempting to harm it.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]] a metal-bladed weapon to cast. The weapon was consumed during casting."
