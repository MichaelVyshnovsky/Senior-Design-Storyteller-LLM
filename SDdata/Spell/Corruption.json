        "mainbody": "Corruption was an arcane necromancy spell that temporarily corrupted a targets soul with greed and ambition.\nThe target of corruption was overwhelmed with dark power and halted in their steps, unable to move as they dreamed of delusions of grandeur. When the spell ended there was a chance the target would look favorably upon the caster.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
