Fear contagion was a special divine abjuration quest spell from the charm and war spheres that instilled fear within a single target that would then infect others with the same fear.
All creatures within  of the target creature would also feel the effects of fear. Any infected creature that ran away would continue to spread fear to other creatures within  of themselves for the duration of the spell.
This spell did not require spell components of any kind.
This spell was used by druids who served Moander during the height of ancient Netherils power.
