        "mainbody": "Sanctify was a conjuration spell that allowed one or more priests to temporarily dedicate an area to their deity, creating a zone beneficial to followers of that deity and those of the same alignment, and detrimental to undead. The reverse of this spell, defile, did the same for evil priests but made it more difficult to turn undead.\nOne priest could bless a 30 ft (9.1 m) square, with each additional priest (of the same deity) adding an additional square. The duration was a number of minutes determined by the level of the most experienced priest plus a couple minutes for each additional caster. While the spell lasted, the area became holy to followers of the deity, boosting their moraleThis refers to the concept of morale as described in BATTLESYSTEM&trade rules. and becoming more resistant to fear- and charm-based attacks as long as they remained in the sanctified area. Friends of the same alignment but different faith were also encouraged, but not to the same degree. Those in the zone wishing to harm the priests or their friends were more susceptible to fear and charm effects, and undead were easier to turn.\nThis spell was often used as a focused spell to bolster the protectors of a temple, castle, or other structure.\nWhen cast in reverse, defile had the same effect regarding charm and fear effects, but priests in the defiled area found it more difficult to turn undead.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, sanctify required the use of the priests holy symbol and a handful of dirt from the grounds of a temple dedicated to their deity. Defile required a handful of grave dirt."
