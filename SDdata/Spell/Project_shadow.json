        "mainbody": "'''''Project shadow''''' was a variant of shadow magic derived from the well-known spell ''[[project image]]''.",
        "Effects": "To successfully cast this spell, the caster was required to be within an area of shadow or darkness. When cast, the spell created a replica of the caster solely composed of the caster's shadow.\n\nThe projected shadow could be directed by the caster to perform various actions such as walking, speaking, or even casting spells. By default, the shadow mimicked the movements of the caster's own shadow, but the caster could concentrate to make it act differently. In such cases, the caster's mobility is limited, and they were unable to engage in physical attacks. Spells could be cast through the projected shadow, functioning as if they were cast by the caster in the location of the projected shadow.\n\nThe projected shadow could only be dispelled by ''[[dispel magic]]'', exposure to direct bright light, or upon the command of the caster. All other forms of attack passed harmlessly through it.\n\nUnlike ''project image'', which was often used to deceive opponents by presenting an illusion of the caster's physical form, this spell had limited effectiveness in this regard. Its primary applications lie in concealing the caster within areas of darkness or shadow, allowing for surprise attacks, or preserving the caster's identity during negotiations with potentially dangerous individuals.\n\nIn addition, whether the caster was invisible at the time of casting had no impact on the projected shadow. If the caster employed spells like ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[teleport]]'', ''[[plane shift]]'', or any other spell that interrupted their line of sight, the spell immediately ended.\n\nFurthermore, this spell could be cast through a scrying device, whether physical (e.g., a [[crystal ball]]) or magical (e.g., a magic font or ''[[shadow serpents]]'' spell). However, additional spells cast through the scrying device did not extend through it. The projected image had to remain within the caster's line of sight at all times, whether observed directly or through scrying. If the caster's vision was obstructed in any way, the spell was immediately broken and dispelled.",
        "Components": "This spell only required a [[verbal component]].",
        "Usage": "The [[shadow dragon]] [[Aurgloroasa]] was known to use ''shadow serpents''."
