        "mainbody": "Divine investiture was a divine enchantment and illusion spell used by specialty priests devoted to Siamorphe called Highborns during important noble ceremonies.\nThis spell was used on newborn noble heirs, during coronations, or upon receipt of a noble title as determined by the divine bloodline spell. The target was bathed in radiant light the color of which was selected by the caster. Pageantry illusions appeared that were appropriate for the event. The recipient received the legacy of Siamorphe which varied from person to person, but usually granted a small permanent boon to the recipient.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material components a chalice of holy water and dye laced with gold flakes to cast. The dye was used to trace the targets heraldry upon their body before the spell was cast. The holy water was poured over the dye during the casting, making it vanish."
