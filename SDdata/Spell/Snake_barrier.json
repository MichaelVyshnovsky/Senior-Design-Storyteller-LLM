        "mainbody": "Snake barrier was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, this spell created an invisible barrier that repelled all reptiles, including dragons. The barrier covered at least a 20 feet by 20 feet (6 meters by 6 meters) area, which expanded as the shugenja grew more powerful. A reptile was able to sense the presence of the barrier despite it being invisible. Use of this spell often enraged sentient reptile-like creatures.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component a piece of skin from a snake."
