        "mainbody": "'''''Snake barrier''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell created an invisible barrier that repelled all reptiles, including [[dragon]]s. The barrier covered at least a 20 feet by 20 feet (6 meters by 6 meters) area, which expanded as the shugenja grew more powerful. A reptile was able to sense the presence of the barrier despite it being invisible. Use of this spell often enraged sentient reptile-like creatures.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a piece of skin from a snake."
