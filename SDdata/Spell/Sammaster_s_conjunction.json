        "mainbody": "'''''Sammaster's conjunction''''' was a powerful [[spell]] that allowed a caster to cast two spells at the same time.",
        "Effects": "This spell had two methods for combining spells. The first method combined spells. When cast, the spell created an oval column of blue light {{SI|70|ft}} in height. This appeared directly in front of the caster. The caster then cast two spells into the column of light, which then vanished. When needed, the caster repeated the last words of this spell, which then cast both spells simultaneously. \n\nThe second method conjoined spells. During casting, the caster choose two memorized spells to be conjoined. Afterwards, when the caster cast one of the conjoined spells, the other one was cast as well.",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a transparent [[quartz]] crystal with faceted sides and a hair from one of the [[Chosen of Mystra]].",
        "History": "This spell was known to be used by [[wizard]]s of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]."
