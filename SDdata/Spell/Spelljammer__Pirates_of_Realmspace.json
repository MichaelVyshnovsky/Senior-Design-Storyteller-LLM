        "mainbody": "pelljammer Pirates of Realmspace  is a video game for MS-DOS released by Strategic Simulations, Inc. in 1992. It uses the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Second Edition, Spelljammer rules. It was programmed and designed by Cybertech Systems. \nThe player captains a ship and crew. The player can ship goods from planet to planet for a fee, take on simple missions including, delivering people and goods, destroying pirates, and guarding the space lanes. As the player completes missions his character gains reputation points, eventually gaining enough points to be asked to help rid Realmspace of a terrible danger. \nThe game starts the player with a 5th level character. The available classes are Clerics, Fighters, Paladins, Rangers, Mages, and Thieves. There are three main parts to the game docked at a planet, in space travel and ship-to-ship combat, and on-board personal combat. \nWhen at a planet, various text menus allowed the player to buy and sell cargo, repair and upgrade their ship, buy and sell character equipment, and seek missions. A rudimentary trade system allowed players to make money shipping goods from planet to planet, and some key planets had more options for ship repairs and equipment. In space, the player can travel from planet to planet, or simply point the ship in any direction and go. \nDuring the course of space travel, the player while travelling in wildspace, may encounter other spelljammer vessels. If the player determines the vessel is hostile, space combat may commence by attacking (or being attacked) by said vessel. Combat consists of two different areas\n* Vessel-To-Vessel combat, where the player can battle other spelljammers with the ships weapons. These weapons (depending on the spelljammer type) consists of ranged weapons (catapult, ballista) ramming, shearing attacks, and grappling the enemy vessel to board it.\n* Hand-to-Hand combat, where the player boards or is boarded by an enemy vessel after a successful grappling attempt (top-down perspective). In hand-to-hand combat, participants are divided into the ships mates and the ships crew. The player has complete control of the ships mates, whereas the artificial intelligence (AI) takes control of the ships crew. Victory is decided when all of the enemy mates and crew are destroyed.\nAnton • Clive the Fearsome • Eldacar • Eldran Firestaff • Estaf Morallan • Findo Burrfoot • Grisdale Helfirsson • Leif Mitdal • Longbottom Greybottle • Quall DOrd • Slath Brokentail • Thoren\nAarakocra • Anadian halfling • Dwarf • Elf • Ghast • Ghoul • Gnome • Goblin • Halfling • Hobgoblin • Illithid • Lich • Lizardfolk • Neogi • Ogre • Orc • Skeleton • Umber hulk • Vampire • Wight • Wraith • Zombie\nPlanets and MoonsAnadia • Chandos • Coliar • Garden • Glyth • HCatha • Karpri • Mingabwe • Toril\nSettlements Athanar • Clives Den • Hisssta • Umberguard • Waterdeep\nGildenholt\nArmor • Bestow Curse • Bless • Blink • Blindness • Blur • Burning Hands • Cause Blindness • Cause Critical Wounds • Cause Light Wounds • Cause Serious Wounds • Chaos • Charm Person • Chill Touch • Cloudkill • Cone of Cold • Confusion • Cure Blindness • Cure Critical Wounds • Cure Disease • Cure Light Wounds • Cure Serious Wounds • Curse • Detect Evil • Detect Good • Detect Invisibility • Detect Magic • Dimension Door • Dispel Evil • Dispel Magic • Enlarge • Fear • Feeblemind • Find Traps • Fireball • Fire Shield • Flame Strike • Friends • Fumble • Gust of Wind • Haste • Hold Monster • Hold Person • Hold undead • Ice Storm • Identify • Invisibility • Knock • Lightning Bolt • Magic Missile • Melfs Acid Arrow • Minor Globe of Invulnerability • Mirror Image • Neutralize Poison • Phantasmal Killer • Poison • Protection from Evil • Protection from Good • Protection from Normal Missiles • Raise Dead • Ray of Enfeeblement • Read Magic • Reduce • Remove Curse • Resist Cold • Scare • Shield • Shocking Grasp • Silence • Slay Living • Sleep • Slow • Slow Poison • Snake Charm • Spiritual Hammer • Spook • Sticks to Snakes • Stinking Cloud • Stoneskin • Strength • Vampiric Touch\nDwarven citadel • Galleon • Hammership • Nautiloid • Neogi deathspider • Neogi mindspider • Tradesman • War galley\nIf you try to purchase a dragonfly from any of the shipyards in the game, you instead purchase a war galley.\nSpelljammer-pirates-of-realmspace-dos-back-cover.jpg|Back cover of DOS edition.\nSJPoR-screenshot2.png|Titlescreen."
