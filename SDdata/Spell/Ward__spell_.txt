'''''Ward''''' was an uncommon [[enchantment]] spell of the [[southern magic]] tradition.{{Southernmagic}}

==Effects==
The spell created a 10-foot-wide (3 meters) cube-shaped magical barrier around the caster. Any creature who entered the warded area was struck with a strong compulsion to leave the area and not return. A creature with magical protection was unaffected, and the warding had no effect on any [[undead]].
 
==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], the feathers from a vulture.
