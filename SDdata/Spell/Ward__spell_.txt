Ward was an uncommon enchantment spell of the southern magic tradition.
The spell created a 10-foot-wide (3 meters) cube-shaped magical barrier around the caster. Any creature who entered the warded area was struck with a strong compulsion to leave the area and not return. A creature with magical protection was unaffected, and the warding had no effect on any undead.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, the feathers from a vulture.
