        "mainbody": "Wind lash was a divine alteration and evocation spell used by priests devoted to Talos, enabling them to create a whip of wind.\nThis spell created an invisible whip of hard air in the casters hand. The caster could use the wind lash to strike out at targets, disrupting any spellcasting from targets and hurling them to the ground. The wind lash would disappear if the caster begun casting another spell, but the caster was able to use magic items in their other hand.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
