Summon natures ally IV was one of the series of summon natures ally spells available to divine spellcasters.
This spell functioned just like all summon natures ally spells, which in turn resembled the summon monster spells. It could summon a single arrowhawk, brown bear, giant crocodile, deinonychus, dire ape, dire boar, dire wolverine, medium elemental, flamebrother, sea cat, huge shark, huge viper, tiger, juvenile tojanida, unicorn, or minor xorn.
It could also be used to summon a larger number of monsters from a lower level of a spell in the series.
The spell required a divine focus and both verbal and somatic components.
