        "mainbody": "'''''Forcelash''''' was a [[spell]] that was first developed by the [[phaerimm]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, a long whip of energy was created at the end of the caster's arm or other limb chosen during casting. This powerful whip was controlled by the caster's willpower and was able to attack a target within {{SI|80|ft}} of the caster. The whip was strong enough to penetrate some barrier or protection spells like ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]''. When struck, the targeted creature became immobile and was wracked with painful spasm as energy coursed through their body.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components."
