        "mainbody": "Overland flight was a transmutation spell that functioned like the spell fly, except that it only affected the caster and was slightly slower, but lasted much longer.\nOver an eight-hour period, the caster of overland flight could travel up to 64 miles.\nThe spell required both verbal and somatic components to cast.\nOverland flight was a necessary component in the crafting of tapestries of shadowy flight, as well as drow driftdiscs."
