Safe clearing was an abjuration spell that a ranger could cast to make an area safe from all attacks, similar to that of sanctuary. It affected an area 30 ft in radius and lasted for a number of hours. Anyone within the spells area-of-effect or anyone passing through after it was cast would be hampered in attacking or harming others or casting any spells that would target another person.
