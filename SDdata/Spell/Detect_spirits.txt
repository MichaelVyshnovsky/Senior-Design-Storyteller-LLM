Detect spirits was a spell used by clerics of Sehanine Moonbow.
By means of this spell, the caster was capable of detecting the presence of almost any kind of spirit, including disembodied, noncorporeal animals and nature spirits, and even astrally projected creatures. The spell could also detect possessed creatures and creatures using magic jar. The detection area of the spell was a path  in width and  in length.
The spell was unable to detect ethereal, invisible or phased creatures. The spell also did not grant the caster the ability to communicate with any detected spirit.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a small pendant made from copper wire with a value of at least 20 gp.
