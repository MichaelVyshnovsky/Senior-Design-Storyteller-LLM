        "mainbody": "Power word, disable, was a powerful spell from the enchantment school that could be wielded by both sorcerers and wizards.\nAfter the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, the spell was able to either bring an opponent to the brink of death or make them collapse unconscious. In both cases, the vital energies of the target were brought to near full depletion.\nThe spell only worked on creatures, under a certain average degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the spellcaster. \nThe spell required only a verbal component, the uttering of the power word itself.\nAs of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, the spell was used by people in Rashemen and Samarach, and on the Dragon Coast and Sword Coast North."
