        "mainbody": "'''''Gallop''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that beginning wizards could learn. It caused a creature to gain a burst of speed and travel in a chosen direction for a short time.",
        "Effects": "This spell worked on any land-based creature within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the caster, but if the creature had above animal intelligence and was unwilling, it had a chance to resist the effects. If successfully cast, the creature moved at twice its normal rate of travel in the direction pointed by the caster and maintained this speed for one minute. Rate of movement was adjusted for encumbrance. That is, a [[horse]] without a rider could move considerably faster than one pulling a heavily laden cart. Travel was in the indicated direction without deviation unless an obstacle was successfully avoided. If the target creature or its rider were aware of any obstacles in the path, there was an improved chance to avoid them, but if not, then the creature and whatever it was carrying suffered the consequences. Likewise, casting ''gallop'' on an injured, sick, lame, or exhausted creature could cause a shock to its system and possibly result in death.The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' limited the duration of this spell as originally described in ''Dragon'' magazine to one round with no extension based on the level of the caster, and expanded the possible targets from \"one quadruped\" to \"one creature\". It also removed the requirement that the caster had to touch the target creature.\n\nChoosing a direction with no path, such as directly into a wall, the ground, or the sky, negated the spell.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s. The caster made clicks with their tongue or kissing noises through pursed lips while pointing in the desired direction of travel.",
        "History": "''[[The Alcaister]]'', a spellbook with a dangerous reputation, contained this cantrip and two others.<ref group=\"note\">The three cantrips described in [[Dragon magazine 100|''Dragon'' #100]] were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''."
