Waves of fatigue was a necromancy spell that instilled fatigue in the targets.
On casting waves of fatigue, the caster generated waves of negative energy within a 30 ft (9 m) cone. This negative energy instilled fatigue in everyone who was not so to begin with.
Waves of fatigue required only somatic and verbal components.
