Prismatic wall was a powerful abjuration spell that created a protective wall that affected any creature trying to cross it with a variety of effects.
A multicolored wall of light 90-ft (27.4 m) long, 30-ft (9.1 m) tall and 1-in (2.5 cm) thick appeared at the casters desired location, within a 60-ft (18.3 m) range, lasting for 10 minutes. It could be shaped in the form of a sphere of up to 30 ft (9.1 m) in diameter as well. The caster could also designate creatures that were immune to the wall and could pass through it unaffected. The spell also did not require the caster to keep concentrating on it. Any other creature attempting to cross the wall had to go through all seven layers, in order, risking suffering the effects of each one, or destroying them one by one
 Red  Inflicted fire damage. It could be destroyed by cold damage.
 Orange  Inflicted acid damage. It could be destroyed by a strong wind.
 Yellow  Inflicted lightning damage. It could be destroyed by force damage.
 Green  Inflicted poison damage. It could be destroyed by a passwall spell or any more powerful spell that could open a passage on a solid surface.
 Blue  Inflicted cold damage. It could be destroyed by fire damage.
 Indigo  A creature affected by this layer became paralyzed and could be subsequently turned to stone. It also prevented spells from being cast through the wall. It could be destroyed by a daylight spell or any more powerful spell that created bright light.
 Violet  A creature affected by this layer became blind, and could be subsequently banished to another plane. It could be destroyed by a dispel magic or more powerful spell that ended magical effects.
The wall was immune to the antimagic field spell, but it could be completely destroyed at once by a rod of cancellation.
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Anglin of Seventon in  and was originally called Anglins wall.
