'''''Prismatic wall''''' was a powerful [[abjuration]] spell that created a protective wall that affected any creature trying to cross it with a variety of effects.

==Effects==
A multicolored wall of light 90-ft (27.4 m) long, 30-ft (9.1 m) tall and 1-in (2.5 cm) thick appeared at the caster's desired location, within a 60-ft (18.3 m) range, lasting for 10 minutes. It could be shaped in the form of a sphere of up to 30 ft (9.1 m) in diameter as well. The caster could also designate creatures that were immune to the wall and could pass through it unaffected. The spell also did not require the caster to keep concentrating on it. Any other creature attempting to cross the wall had to go through all seven layers, in order, risking suffering the effects of each one, or destroying them one by one:

; Red : Inflicted [[fire]] damage. It could be destroyed by cold damage.
; Orange : Inflicted [[acid]] damage. It could be destroyed by a strong wind.
; Yellow : Inflicted lightning damage. It could be destroyed by [[force]] damage.
; Green : Inflicted [[poison]] damage. It could be destroyed by a ''[[passwall]]'' spell or any more powerful spell that could open a passage on a solid surface.
; Blue : Inflicted cold damage. It could be destroyed by [[fire]] damage.
; Indigo : A creature affected by this layer became paralyzed and could be subsequently turned to stone. It also prevented spells from being cast through the wall. It could be destroyed by a ''[[daylight]]'' spell or any more powerful spell that created bright light.
; Violet : A creature affected by this layer became blind, and could be subsequently banished to another [[plane]]. It could be destroyed by a ''[[dispel magic]]'' or more powerful spell that ended magical effects.

The wall was immune to the ''[[antimagic field]]'' spell, but it could be completely destroyed at once by a ''[[rod of cancellation]]''.

==Components==
The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Anglin]] of [[Seventon]] in {{Yearlink|-1923}} and was originally called ''Anglin's wall''.
