        "mainbody": "'''''Bloom''''' was a minor arcane [[spell]] that allowed a [[magic-user]] to conjure flowers in bloom.{{Cite comic/The Gathering|9}}{{Cite comic/Sorcerer's Moon|12-13}}",
        "Effect": "The ''bloom'' spell simply conjured a cut flower, typically a rose, in full bloom and floating in the air where directed.",
        "Practitioners": "It was a special spell known to [[elves]] of [[Shadowdale]]. It was considered a simple and harmless spell.",
        "History": "[[Cybriana]] of Shadowdale was traveling to [[Waterdeep]] in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]] when she lodged with [[Jalma]] and two other [[elf|elven]] women. At Jalma's question about the spells of Shadowdale elves, Cybriana demonstrated the ''bloom'' spell. However, she was shocked to find her fingers transformed into pink crystal, the result of a curse when she used arcane magic.\n\nLater, when trapped inside a ''[[forcecage]]'', Cybriana used a ''bloom'' spell, conjuring fresh flowers throughout the caverns below where her friends battled through [[Imgig Zu]]'s [[ogre]] minions. The flowers formed a trail, leading [[Timoth Eyesbright]] and the others to her rescue.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], when [[magic]] went awry, [[Kyriani]] attempted ''bloom''. It worked, but created not only a flower in bloom, but a monstrous flower monster that attempted to swallow her. [[Luna]]'s ''[[dispel magic]]'' did not work on it. Timoth rescued her as [[Vajra Valmeyjar]] burned the monster.{{Cite comic/Selune Rising}}"
