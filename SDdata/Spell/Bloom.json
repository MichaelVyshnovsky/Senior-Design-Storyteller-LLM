        "mainbody": "loom was a minor arcane spell that allowed a magic-user to conjure flowers in bloom.\nThe bloom spell simply conjured a cut flower, typically a rose, in full bloom and floating in the air where directed.\nIt was a special spell known to elves of Shadowdale. It was considered a simple and harmless spell.\nCybriana of Shadowdale was traveling to Waterdeep in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR when she lodged with Jalma and two other elven women. At Jalmas question about the spells of Shadowdale elves, Cybriana demonstrated the bloom spell. However, she was shocked to find her fingers transformed into pink crystal, the result of a curse when she used arcane magic.\nLater, when trapped inside a forcecage, Cybriana used a bloom spell, conjuring fresh flowers throughout the caverns below where her friends battled through Imgig Zus ogre minions. The flowers formed a trail, leading Timoth Eyesbright and the others to her rescue.\nDuring the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, when magic went awry, Kyriani attempted bloom. It worked, but created not only a flower in bloom, but a monstrous flower monster that attempted to swallow her. Lunas dispel magic did not work on it. Timoth rescued her as Vajra Valmeyjar burned the monster."
