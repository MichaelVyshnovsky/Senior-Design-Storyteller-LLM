When it is cast, ''dragonfrost'' slams an icy gust into a creature of the sorcerer's choice within fifty feet, pushing them back up to five feet and causing them injury from its frigid power, which is fueled by the sorcerer's charisma like virtually all sorcerer spells. ''Dragonfrost'' is instantly recastable and its power grows as the sorcerer using it does."
