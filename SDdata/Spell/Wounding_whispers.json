        "mainbody": "Wounding whispers was a spell commonly used by bards.\nWhen cast, the spell surrounded the caster with faint audible whispers. Any nearby creature who heard these whispers were injured. If a creature attempted to attack the caster in melee combat while the spell was still in effect, the creature was struck with sonic damage. Since the spell only harmed a creature who touched the caster, missiles or projectiles did not trigger the sonic defence. A caster was unable to target a specific creature with the whispers.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
