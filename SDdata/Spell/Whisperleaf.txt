Whisperleaf was a divine magic spell granted to priests of Baervan Wildwanderer, the Masked Leaf. It turned a living oak limb into a magic spear.
This spell could only be cast on a live oak branch that was still attached to the tree. The caster touched the branch as the spell was cast and it detached from the tree, becoming a +1 spear (more experienced casters could create more powerful magical spears). Only the caster could wield the weapon and it reverted back to a normal (detached) branch when the spell expired. Whisperleaf lasted a minimum of ten minutes (even longer for more experienced casters).
This spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The priest used their holy symbol and had to touch a living oak branch.
