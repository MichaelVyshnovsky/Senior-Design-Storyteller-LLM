'''''Whisperleaf''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to priests of [[Baervan Wildwanderer]], the Masked Leaf. It turned a living [[oak]] limb into a magic [[spear]].

==Effects==
This spell could only be cast on a live oak branch that was still attached to the tree. The caster touched the branch as the spell was cast and it detached from the tree, becoming a ''+1 spear'' (more experienced casters could create more powerful magical spears). Only the caster could wield the weapon and it reverted back to a normal (detached) branch when the spell expired. ''Whisperleaf'' lasted a minimum of ten minutes (even longer for more experienced casters).

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The priest used their [[holy symbol]] and had to touch a living oak branch.
