        "Usage": "This spell was used in conjunction with one to four other spells that were cast immediately after the ''spell trigger'' was memorized. The spells could be identical and could even be cast by other individuals. [[Divine magic|Divine spells]] could even be used. A word was added during the casting of each spell added to the ''spell trigger'' that would later release the spell when spoken.\n\nThe trigger words could be spoken back to back, releasing the magic of all stored spells at the same time in the order in which they were initially cast. The effects of these stored spells was always maximized. The caster needed to see a target for a spell to affect them.",
