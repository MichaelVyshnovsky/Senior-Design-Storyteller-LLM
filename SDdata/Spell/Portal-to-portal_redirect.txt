Portal-to-portal redirect was a transmutation spell that temporarily changed the destination of a portal.
The caster of the portal-to-portal redirect changed the destination of the targeted portal. There were a number of limitations to it. First, only portal-destinations that the caster actually traveled to via portals were a possible destination. Second, only the destination was changed, no other property of the targeted portal could be changed. For example, a one-way-portal could not be changed into a two-way one.
Casting portal-to-portal redirect required somatic and verbal components as well as a divine focus.
By 1372 DR, a magical staff called a staff of portals had been invented in the Underdark that could be used to cast the spell. It required the portal-to-portal redirect spell to craft.
