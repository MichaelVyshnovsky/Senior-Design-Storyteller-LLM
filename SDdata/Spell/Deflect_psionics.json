        "mainbody": "Deflect psionics was a spell used by clerics of Deep Duerra.\nWhen cast, this spell deflected psionic attacks directed towards the caster. However, this spell only protected the caster if another creature was within the spells area of effect. If that was the case, the psionic attack deflected and struck the other individual instead. The spell could not deflect a psionic attack back to its origin. If no other creature was within the spells area of effect, the psionic attack struck the caster as intended.\nIn addition to a somatic component, this spell required a material component, the holy symbol of Deep Duerra."
