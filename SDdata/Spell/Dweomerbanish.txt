'''''Dweomerbanish''''' was a [[spell]] that broke all ongoing magic within its area.

==Effects==
Within a {{SI|40|feet|long=yes}} radius, all ongoing effects were ceased, even those of scouring magic such as ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[spell engine]]'', or ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction]]''.The spells ''dispel magic'' and ''Mordenkainen's disjunction'' are not instantaneous in duration, but they are specifically named. Some variant effect may be implied. Though it only struck effects longer than instantaneous, it was effective even against ''[[prismatic sphere]]'' and ''[[sphere of wonder]]''. However, only the area intersected by the dweomerbanish's area was cleaned; this could leave some effects reduced in area without being outright eliminated. Some permanent, multifold effects, wardmists and ''[[mythal]]s'' for instance, were only suppressed for about an hour instead.

The spell was ineffective against any magic cast directly by deities. Furthermore, it dealt some damage to the caster- of which, a certain amount was irreversible.

==Components==
Besides [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required two finger bones from archmages. They could belong to the same archmage.

==History==
[[Azuth]] made this spell available through [[Elminster]] sometime prior to {{yearlink|1370}}.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|101}}
