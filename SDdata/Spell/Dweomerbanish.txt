Dweomerbanish was a spell that broke all ongoing magic within its area.
Within a  radius, all ongoing effects were ceased, even those of scouring magic such as dispel magic, spell engine, or Mordenkainens disjunction.The spells dispel magic and Mordenkainens disjunction are not instantaneous in duration, but they are specifically named. Some variant effect may be implied. Though it only struck effects longer than instantaneous, it was effective even against prismatic sphere and sphere of wonder. However, only the area intersected by the dweomerbanishs area was cleaned this could leave some effects reduced in area without being outright eliminated. Some permanent, multifold effects, wardmists and mythals for instance, were only suppressed for about an hour instead.
The spell was ineffective against any magic cast directly by deities. Furthermore, it dealt some damage to the caster- of which, a certain amount was irreversible.
Besides verbal and somatic components, the spell required two finger bones from archmages. They could belong to the same archmage.
