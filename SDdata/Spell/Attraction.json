        "mainbody": "Attraction was a divine spell common in Kara-Tur that caused attacks to be more attracted to a target. It was the reverse of the spell deflection.\nThe targeted creature was surrounded by a mystical aura that drew physical attacks toward it, both melee and ranged attacks but not magical ones. The subject of the spell could be anywhere within close range of the caster, and the attraction to attacks lasted for over ten seconds, depending on the power of the caster.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components."
