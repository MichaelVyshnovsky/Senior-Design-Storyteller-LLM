        "Effects": "When cast, this spell temporarily transformed one of the caster's eyes into a brilliant gold orb of pure evil. When the caster glared at a target within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}, the targeted creature was struck with blindness. This magical blindness could only be reversed by the casting of either a ''[[remove curse]]'' or ''[[cure blindness or deafness]]'' spell. There was a chance the blindness could become permanent. If permanently blinded, only the ''[[heal]]'' or ''[[regenerate]]'' spells could restore sight to the affected creature.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components."
