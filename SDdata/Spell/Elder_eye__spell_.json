        "mainbody": "Elder Eye was a spell used by clerics of Ghaunadaur.\nWhen cast, this spell temporarily transformed one of the casters eyes into a brilliant gold orb of pure evil. When the caster glared at a target within , the targeted creature was struck with blindness. This magical blindness could only be reversed by the casting of either a remove curse or cure blindness or deafness spell. There was a chance the blindness could become permanent. If permanently blinded, only the heal or regenerate spells could restore sight to the affected creature.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components."
