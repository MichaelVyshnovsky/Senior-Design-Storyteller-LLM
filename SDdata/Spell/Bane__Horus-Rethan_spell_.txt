Bane was a powerful divine magic spell granted to priests of Horus-Re. It bestowed a permanent curse on a creature that was likely to make their life miserable and short. There were very few ways to remove bane, but reverse bane was one of them.
After casting the spell, the caster had ten minutes in which to touch the intended victim or the spell was wasted. If the target managed to resist the spell, they were still afflicted with a terrible curse that could only be removed by reverse bane or a wish. A deity of any sort could also remove it using remove curse, but mortals only had the other two options. If the victim failed to resist the spell, their attempts at attack or defense became woefully inept, they could not resist any form of attack (magic, poison, breath weapon, etc.), and always suffered the worst possible injury from any successful attack.
Reverse bane was equally powerful, being able to remove bane, major curse, bestow curse, and other afflictions of that type. However, it only worked on relatively long-term curses, not instantaneous ones like a cursed scroll that explodes when read.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast.
