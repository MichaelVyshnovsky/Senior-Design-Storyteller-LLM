A necromancer, known as a headshrinker on the Malatran Plateau, though the term was sometimes misapplied by commonfolk to anyone practicing necromancy or casting spells from its school. These wizards harnessed the energy that brought life to everything, draining it from their opponents and using it to wield powerful magic.

Whether it was due to their personal worldview, such as seeing little need for the company of the living, necromancers often retreated far out to the lawless fringes of civilization to make their homes and conduct research in peace. This was especially the case for the archetypal evil necromancers and the insane philosophers. Some took up home within deep caverns or abandoned structures, such as ancient castles and crypts. Others saw fit to newly construct a tower upon the grounds of graveyards, old battlefields, ruined cities, and other such places where the raw materials for creating undead could be found in abundance.
Despite the many difficulties they could face living in most of civilization, some necromancers, such as those of the anatomist variety and the most powerful of drow necromancers, chose to live within the confines of large towns or cities. Such individuals usually had jobs, like that of a physician or a teacher in one of drow societys colleges of sorcery, and required an abundant supply of cadavers that would be hard to come by out in the wilderness. Unless necromancy was accepted within society, as was the case with drow, living in civilized society required necromancers to disguise their profession. Male drow necromancers would typically flee from the safety of their cities and into the deeper bowels of the Underdark whenever they questioned their role in the matriarchal hierarchy of udadrow society, lest they be transformed into a drider for their insolence.
Following the Spellplague, necromancers often established their labs in places either connected to the Shadowfell, or within the very Shadowfell itself, in order to study that planes part in undeath.

Though all necromancers were by their very nature focused on a singular school of magic, they tended to fall into one of a number of pathways that approached necromancy from different angles.
Anatomists were necromancers of a scholarly bent, more concerned with the physical sciences then the afterlife or undead creatures. They devoted themselves to the scientific study of bodies and often utilized magic to aid or inform their extensive research on cadavers. They always took up careers that utilized the vast knowledge of anatomy they had accrued over the years, either towards good in the medical field or towards more malevolent ends.
The archetypal necromancer was the most stereotypical and conventionally known variety of necromancer. These wizards were evil, selfish individuals that worked towards malevolent ends, such as achieving lichdom, and reveled in their creation of undead. Compared to other necromancers they were jacks-of-all-trades, not specializing in any particular aspect of necromancy.
Unique to the land of Zakhara, ghul lords were necromancers that channeled negative energy. Unlike other necromancers, ghul lords didnâ€™t actually memorize or cast spells, but merely duplicated the effects of those from the necromancy school through their manipulation of negative energy.
Philosophers were the theoreticians among necromancers, individuals who took up the study of necromancy simply because of the allure generated by its taboo nature. They were individuals captivated by knowledge that was banned or forbidden, driven by a desire to uncover the hidden mysteries of life. They were the most knowledgeable when it came to netherworld lore and had a higher tendency than other necromancers to be wild talents, but they found it more difficult to learn spells from other schools of magic.
So corrupted by the power of necromancy that they took their evil a step further than archetypal necromancers, true necromancers were those who sought out access to divine magic so they could combine the foulest aspects of both divine and arcane necromancy.
Undead masters were necromancers that focused their mastery of the Art towards the act of creating, augmenting, and controlling undead creatures. What made them stand out the most from other necromancers was that their desire for power above all else lead them to learn spells of enchantment/charm, allowing them to dominate the wills of both the living and outsiders.
The least well known and least numerous of the subtypes of necromancers, utilizing such spells as Nulathoes ninemen and Spendelards chaser. Generally of good alignments, they dedicated their mastery of the Art towards the betterment of society. Usually having an interest in the body and curative magic, many put their talents to work as healers, sometimes restoring missing or damaged limbs or organs, whilst others worked with local churches and used their magic to ensure the dead were properly and permanently interred. One of the reasons for their rarity was that their restorative magic was inferior to the divine healing of clerics, as it drew upon the life energy of a volunteer, thus many of those interested in curative magic tended towards priesthoods instead of necromancy. Additionally, due to practitioners of "black necromancy" spreading negative stereotypes regarding all forms of necromancy, white necromancers often had to take on some form of "cover identity" and a job. Some typical jobs included gardener, herbalist, and gravekeeper, and veterinarian. Those within the Church of Kelemvor often acted as temple wardens, burial yard caretakers, and occasionally bodyguards for priests.
Some witches could be classified as necromancers. These "witch necromancers", also known as mediums or spirit channelers, were necromancers that specialized in communication with spirits, fulfilling a role akin to that of diviners. Unlike other necromancers, they were taught their repertoire of spells by spirits of the dead.
