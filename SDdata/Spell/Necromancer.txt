A '''necromancer''', known as a '''headshrinker''' on the [[Malatran Plateau]], though the term was sometimes misapplied by commonfolk to anyone practicing necromancy or casting spells from its school. These wizards harnessed the [[positive energy|energy that brought life to everything]], draining it from their opponents and using it to wield powerful magic.

==Culture==

[[Human]]s constituted the overwhelming majority of necromancers. Some viewed them as the only ones capable of mastering necromancy, whilst others felt these demographics were merely an issue of racial focuses &ndash; humans had shorter lifespans than all the [[demihuman]] races, thus death from natural causes was of greater concern to them. Necromancers could be found amongst other races though, such as [[dragon]]s, [[drow]], [[drider]]s, [[githyanki]], very rarely [[orc]]s, and [[yuan-ti]].{{Cite polyhedron/114/Forgotten Deities: Ssethh/Vaerae}} There were also occasional instances of human-adjacent races taking up the mantle of necromancer, such as the [[yuan-ti pureblood]] [[Semorav]]<ref> and the [[earth genasi]] [[Espera]].<ref> Amongst the various races of dragons, the ones with the greatest propensity for being necromancers were [[shadow dragon]]s.

Drow necromancers were usually male, as wizardry was one of the few ways they could advance in the matriarchal [[udadrow]] society.

Common personality traits among necromancers included vengefulness, But the traits that were vital for any potential necromancer was mental stability and strong self-control or willpower, as frequenting traffic with undead [[spirit]]s and more powerful [[Lower Planes]] creatures could exact a toll on the wizard's mind. If a necromancer was lacking in a strong will, there was a strong possibility of falling prey to madness and insanity.<ref>

Their manner of dress tended to reflect their outlook on life, though in the latter's case it was mostly done in order to offset the bad reputation of necromancers. Particularly powerful necromancers were known to feature highlights of silver, red, or gold in their robes.

===Alignment===
While not all necromancers were morally corrupt,

===Lairs===
[[File:Necromancer lair.jpg|thumb|''The lair of necromancer [[Balthazar (necromancer)|Balthazar]] in the [[Moonrise Towers]].''|435x435px]]
Whether it was due to their personal worldview, such as seeing little need for the company of the living, necromancers often retreated far out to the lawless fringes of civilization to make their homes and conduct research in peace. This was especially the case for the archetypal evil necromancers and the insane philosophers. Some took up home within deep caverns or abandoned structures, such as ancient castles and crypts. Others saw fit to newly construct a tower upon the grounds of graveyards, old battlefields, ruined cities, and other such places where the raw materials for creating undead could be found in abundance.

Despite the many difficulties they could face living in most of civilization, some necromancers, such as those of the anatomist variety and the most powerful of drow necromancers, chose to live within the confines of large towns or cities. Such individuals usually had jobs, like that of a physician or a teacher in one of drow society's colleges of sorcery, and required an abundant supply of cadavers that would be hard to come by out in the wilderness. Unless necromancy was accepted within society, as was the case with drow, living in civilized society required necromancers to disguise their profession. Male drow necromancers would typically flee from the safety of their cities and into the deeper bowels of the [[Underdark]] whenever they questioned their role in the matriarchal hierarchy of udadrow society, lest they be transformed into a drider for their insolence.

Following the [[Spellplague]], necromancers often established their labs in places either connected to the [[Shadowfell]], or within the very Shadowfell itself, in order to study that plane's part in undeath.<ref>

===Reputation & Relationships===
[[File:Necromancers vs harpers.png|thumb|''Necromancers – enemies of the [[Harpers]].''|435x435px]]
One of the great hurdles to being a necromancer was the near-universal social stigma attached to necromancy,{{Cite polyhedron/98/The Ministry of Art: Ravens Bluff's Newest Government Branch|7}} or "forbidden art", However, necromancers elicited comparatively less distrust and enmity than [[warlock]]s.<ref>

Some places in the Realms tolerated the presence of necromancers, viewing it as impertinent to exclude necromancy among the other schools of magic. Such places included the city of [[Ravens Bluff]],{{Cite polyhedron/98/The Ministry of Art: Ravens Bluff's Newest Government Branch|6-7}} the city of [[Calimport]]<ref><ref> as well as the wider nation of [[Calimshan]] during the [[Shoon Imperium]],<ref> the necromancer built city of [[Pholzubbal]],<ref> the necromancer-ruled island of [[Sahu]],<ref> the southern [[magocratic]] nation of [[Halruaa]],

Some places even had necromancers on governing bodies where each of the eight schools of magic were represented. These included the [[Ministry of Art]], the magic branch of Ravens Bluff's government, And some necromancer ruled nations employed these wizards to bolster their armed forces with the undead, and the Shoon Imperium with its [[Necromancer Corps]]. However, even in some of these places where their presence was tolerated, necromancers were still viewed with suspicion and looked down upon. Such was the case in Ravens Bluff and Halruaa. In the latter, they were the least respected of all specialty wizards,<ref> with Halruaans viewing necromancy as dishonorable and one of the weaker disciplines.

Professions that were devoted to the hunting and destruction of undead typically held disdain and enmity towards necromancers, even if they were of the same [[alignment]], and interactions between them often resulted in conflict. These included such things as [[deathslayer]]s, [[doomguide]]s,<ref> the [[Eye of Horus-Re|eyes of Horus-Re]],<ref> [[necrobane]]s,  and [[undead slayer]]s. And other specialist wizards, such as [[enchanter]]s and [[illusionist]]s whose spells typically could not affect the undead, did not get on well with necromancers. And in some cases, adventuring companies, [[bounty hunter]]s, or vigilantes might come after them simply because of selfish desires to obtain magical items and either prestige or a reward from the local prejudiced populace.

On the opposite end of the spectrum were [[Myrkulyte]] [[priest]]s. Their faith expected them to fight for the rights of necromancers in society. They did so by coercing various courtiers, lawkeepers, and rulers to turn away from the harsh treatment of these specialist wizards. And when coercion wouldn't work, the Grinning Anointed would resort to murdering the intolerant individual.

Outside of these two extremes, there were those simply willing to work for necromancers, often in return for [[coin]]s or magical items. Much like other wizards, they often had a need for living henchmen or hirelings for various purposes. Undertaking tasks such as defending their stronghold, administration, spying, procurement of cadavers if the necromancer lived in civilized society, and graverobbing. Though some necromancers instead opted to create what was known as [[zombie grave digger]]s for that particular purpose.{{Cite dragon/371/Creature Incarnations: Zombies|48}} In order of commonality, these henchmen were usually [[fighter]]s, [[bard]]s or [[rogue]]s, other necromancers, [[psionicist]]s, or clerics of death gods. They were almost never serviced by [[druid]]s, [[paladin]]s, [[ranger]]s, or other specialist wizards.

===Religion ===
Whereas wizards as a whole in [[Faerûn]] were associated with [[Mystra]], Goddess of Magic and manifestation of [[the Weave]], necromancers were particularly associated with the [[demigod]] [[Velsharoon]] the Lich-Lord,{{cite book/Magic of Faerûn|7-8}} though other races that practiced necromancy also had their own gods of undeath that they were associated with. For drow necromancers this was the goddess [[Kiaransalee]],

It was rare, though not unheard of, for necromancers to become members of clergies. The [[Church of Kiaransalee]] counted some necromancers among its clergy, usually taking on the role of a [[yathrinshee]], cleric-wizard leaders of the secretive church that combined their [[divine]] mastery of undeath with arcane necromancy. In terms of [[monastic order]]s, some necromancers rounded out the ranks of the [[Order of the Long Death]].

==Abilities==
Out of all the fields of study pursued by those who practiced the necromantic arts, there were four in particular that were most commonly studied &ndash; [[anatomy]], [[necrology]], [[netherworld knowledge]], and [[spirit lore]]. These respectively covered the study of the human body, the study of the undead, the study of [[afterlife|afterlives]], and the study of both divination and contacting [[power]]s or [[spirit]]s.

Necromancers generally couldn't learn [[illusion]] or [[enchantment/charm]] spells, as they were oppositional [[schools of magic]], though there were exceptions among some necromancer archetypes. And even with permissible schools of magic, they experience some initial difficulties in learning spells from them.

They likewise generally couldn't utilize specialized [[magical item]]s that involved either spells or spell-like effects from the charm and illusion schools, such as ''[[eyes of charming]]'' and ''[[wand of fear|wands of fear]]''. However, necromancers tended to devise their own necromantic items that could achieve effects similar to those of other magical items, albeit with slightly distinct properties. These magical items often used bones as a principal component,<ref> with applications of the [[gemstone]] [[morion]] to strengthen them and ward off necromantic manipulation of the material.<ref>

After the [[Shadow Weave]] became widespread knowledge around the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, necromancers learned to tap into for their magic as an alternative to the Weave. In the years following the simultaneous collapse of both in [[Tarsakh 29]], [[1385 DR]], powerful necromancers managed to develop their own unique methods of harnessing dark energies from the Shadowfell to fuel their spells.<ref>{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Year of the Ageless One}}<ref>

===Familiars===
Just like any other specialty wizard, many necromancers had companion creatures known as [[familiar]]s. These familiars commonly took the form of [[crow]]s, [[hyena]]s, [[raven]]s, [[serpent]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[weasel]]s, as well as [[deathfang]]s among yuan-ti necromancers.{{Cite polyhedron/114/Forgotten Deities: Ssethh/Vaerae}}<ref>

Beyond animals and beasts, necromancers skilled in conjuration sometimes had extraplanar creatures as familiars. Evil necromancers tended towards most commonly [[imp]]s and [[quasit]]s, though sometimes were seen to have different types of [[fiend]]s, like [[nightmare]]s or even [[succubi]] if they were particularly powerful. Good necromancers might be seen with an [[archon]] or lesser [[deva]] as a familiar. And the philosopher subtype was sometimes known to recruit familiars from the [[Elemental Planes]], such as [[aerial servant]]s, [[invisible stalker]]s, or even [[genie]]s.

Fiendish familiars carried certain added risks. Upon their death, a necromancer suffered from potentially fatal [[death magic]]; thus, they were rarely subjected to unnecessary risks. Additionally, they were likely vying for the day their mortal master died in hopes they could collect their [[soul]] and present it to their overlords in the Lower Planes.

==Necromancer Archetypes==
[[File:Danse macabre5e.png|thumb|435x435px|''A Red Wizard necromancer casting [[danse macabre]].'']]
Though all necromancers were by their very nature focused on a singular school of magic, they tended to fall into one of a number of pathways that approached necromancy from different angles.

===Anatomist===
[[Anatomist]]s were necromancers of a scholarly bent, more concerned with the physical sciences then the afterlife or undead creatures. They devoted themselves to the scientific study of bodies and often utilized magic to aid or inform their extensive research on cadavers. They always took up careers that utilized the vast knowledge of anatomy they had accrued over the years, either towards good in the medical field or towards more malevolent ends.

===Archetypal Necromancer===
The [[archetypal necromancer]] was the most stereotypical and conventionally known variety of necromancer. These wizards were evil, selfish individuals that worked towards malevolent ends, such as achieving [[lichdom]], and reveled in their creation of undead. Compared to other necromancers they were jacks-of-all-trades, not specializing in any particular aspect of necromancy.

===Ghul Lord ===
Unique to the land of [[Zakhara]], [[ghul lord]]s were necromancers that channeled [[negative energy]]. Unlike other necromancers, ghul lords didn’t actually memorize or cast spells, but merely duplicated the effects of those from the necromancy school through their manipulation of negative energy.<ref>
===Philosopher===
[[Philosopher]]s were the theoreticians among necromancers, individuals who took up the study of necromancy simply because of the allure generated by its taboo nature. They were individuals captivated by knowledge that was banned or forbidden, driven by a desire to uncover the hidden mysteries of life. They were the most knowledgeable when it came to netherworld lore and had a higher tendency than other necromancers to be [[psionics|wild talents]], but they found it more difficult to learn spells from other schools of magic.

===True Necromancer===
So corrupted by the power of necromancy that they took their evil a step further than archetypal necromancers, [[true necromancer]]s were those who sought out access to [[divine magic]] so they could combine the foulest aspects of both divine and arcane necromancy.<ref>

===Undead Master===
[[Undead master]]s were necromancers that focused their mastery of the Art towards the act of creating, augmenting, and controlling undead creatures. What made them stand out the most from other necromancers was that their desire for power above all else lead them to learn spells of enchantment/charm, allowing them to dominate the wills of both the living and [[outsider]]s.

===White Necromancer===
The least well known{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-05-15 - White necromancers}} and least numerous of the subtypes of necromancers, utilizing such spells as ''[[Nulathoe's ninemen]]'' and ''[[Spendelard's chaser]]''. Generally of [[good]] alignments, they dedicated their mastery of the Art towards the betterment of society. Usually having an interest in the body and curative magic, many put their talents to work as healers, sometimes restoring missing or damaged limbs or organs, whilst others worked with local churches and used their magic to ensure the dead were properly and permanently interred. One of the reasons for their rarity was that their restorative magic was inferior to the divine healing of [[cleric]]s, as it drew upon the life energy of a volunteer, thus many of those interested in curative magic tended towards priesthoods instead of necromancy. Additionally, due to practitioners of "black necromancy" spreading negative stereotypes regarding all forms of necromancy, white necromancers often had to take on some form of "cover identity" and a job. Some typical jobs included gardener, herbalist, and gravekeeper, and [[veterinarian]]. Those within the Church of Kelemvor often acted as temple wardens, burial yard caretakers, and occasionally bodyguards for priests.

=== Witch===
Some [[witch]]es could be classified as necromancers. These "witch necromancers", also known as '''mediums''' or '''spirit channelers''', were necromancers that specialized in communication with spirits, fulfilling a role akin to that of [[diviner]]s. Unlike other necromancers, they were taught their repertoire of spells by spirits of the dead.
