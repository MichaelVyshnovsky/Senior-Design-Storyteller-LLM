Annams unblinking eye was a rare giant rune that allowed its caster to replicate the eponymous deitys ability to gaze upon any creature throughout the multiverse.
By pouring water into the inscribed bowl, the caster activated the runes effect—scrying, similar to that of a crystal ball—revealing in the waters reflection the targeted individual and their surroundings. If the target was a living creature then it and the caster would feel an ominous chill for the duration of this scrying.
The unblinking eye could not relay sound and was limited to transmitting visual information. The duration of the runes effect would last for a number of minutes equivalent to the casters level. A caster could study this rune extensively for an unlimited number of times and the number of times they studied it would multiply the runes base duration.
If the three instances of the unblinking eye were not perfectly and evenly spaced around its circumference, then the inscribed bowl would shatter upon activation.
Like most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune transformation. The process of shaping this rune generally took around three to four hours and it needed to be done with rare pigments that typically cost around 1,000 gp.
The caster needed to inscribe the true name of their target creature upon the base of a large, deep bowl. Finally, they needed to inscribe the unblinking eye three times around the outside of that bowl and have them evenly spaced around its circumference.
