        "mainbody": "'''''Catfall''''' was a [[psionic]] power of the [[psychoportation]] [[discipline]] that let the user land with ease after a fall.",
        "Effects": "Much like a [[cat]], the manifester could leap gracefully and always land on their feet. If they fell from a heigh, they could react immediately and absorb the impact of the landing, reducing any injury they might take from the fall, even taking none at all if the distance wasn't too great or more psionic energy was spent.\n\n''Catfall'' could be manifested with a moment's thought, so it could be used as a reaction in the event of a sudden fall. Alternatively, it could be cast beforehand, in which case it lasted for one minute or several seconds or longer for more experienced psionics-users. It affected only the manifester; it could not be placed on another.",
        "Displays": "It had only the standard auditory [[display]].",
