'''''Make real''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[cleric]] to make permanent any [[magic]]al alterations that had been placed upon an object. It was one of several spells created by the ''[[Balance of Belaros]]'', a holy [[relic]] to the [[Church of Tyr]].

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, it made permanent any spells or magical effects that were imbued into an item, such as a weapon or tool.

==Usage==
''Make real'' was used by clerics of [[Tyr]] to create various [[Item enchantment|magic items]] for their temples. Alternately, it was used by [[Church of Tyr|Tyrran clergy]] to "modify" the properties of those they sought to punish.

Tyr looked poorly on his priests that used this spell in a trivial manner.

==Components==
The casting of ''make real'' required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s.
