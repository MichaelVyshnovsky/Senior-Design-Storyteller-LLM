Ritual of transference was a cooperative divine alteration spell that transfered charges of magical energy between two items.
In addition to an item to item transfer, power could also be drawn from altars, artifacts, or other souces of great power. Ritual of transference was also rarely used to imbue individuals with extra power to help them defend an area.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components two consecrated holy symbols to cast.
