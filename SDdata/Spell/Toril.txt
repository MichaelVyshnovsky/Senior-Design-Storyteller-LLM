'''Toril''' ({{Pronounce|toh|RILL|refs=|audio=Toril.ogg}}) was the third planet from the [[the Sun|Sun]] in [[Realmspace]]. It was orbited by one moon named [[Selûne (moon)|Selûne]], and by a cluster of asteroids, known as the [[Tears of Selûne]].

Throughout most of its history, Toril was known less commonly as '''[[Abeir-Toril]]'''. Since the [[Spellplague]] and the revelation of the existence of a planetary sibling known as [[Abeir]], and the fact that both Abeir and Toril were once united, the latter name came to informally mean the formerly united worlds of Abeir and Toril.

==Geography==
Toril was comparable in size to the planet [[Earth]], with an equatorial circumference of about {{SI|25000|miles|k|long=yes}}. Its polar circumference was slightly smaller, at approximately {{SI|24900|miles|k|long=yes}}.

Toril consisted of various continents and islands, including [[Faerûn]], [[Kara-Tur]], and [[Zakhara]] in the central super-continent [[Maztica]], and [[Katashaka]] in the western region of the world. There was also one large and very mysterious continent east of Kara-Tur called [[Osse]] whose nature and inhabitants were all but unknown.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Eastern Classes}}

Following the Spellplague, however, Maztica was sent to Abeir, the sibling world of Toril, and a new continent, [[Laerakond]], appeared in the west. Maztica returned to Toril during the [[Second Sundering]].<ref name="DMG5e-p68>

===Continents===
[[File:Toril-3e.jpg|thumb|300px|''Projection of Toril showing all its known continents as of the late 14{{th}} century DR.'']]
* '''[[Faerûn]]''': The westernmost portion of Toril's central supercontinent, a diverse landscape inhabited by numerous races and cultures, including [[human]]s, [[dwarf|dwarves]], [[elf|elves]], [[halfling]]s, and [[gnome]]s.
* '''[[Zakhara]]''': A mostly hot, arid realm dominated by elemental forces and a philosophy of [[Fate]] and Honor.
* '''[[Kara-Tur]]''': The east, steeped in ancient history.
* '''[[Maztica]]''': Primitive cultures bound by duty to their gods gave blood sacrifices in return for power while those who disagreed with the practice struggled to survive.
* '''[[Anchorome]]''': Hardly explored, seemingly populated with violent elves and more of the humans found in Maztica.
* '''[[Katashaka]]''': South of Maztica. Unexplored.
* '''[[Laerakond]]''': A continent formerly located in the world of Abeir, a land of [[dragon]] empires and "new" cultures.
* '''[[Osse]]''': Populated by spiritualists and [[druid]]s, the spirit world and nature dominated the lives of its inhabitants. Unexplored.

==History==
The known history of Toril spans for thousands of years, extending back into the misty epochs after [[Ao]] sundered the world of Abeir-Toril after the [[Tearfall]], splitting it into the two twin planets, Abeir and Toril.

===The Dawn Ages===
{{Main|Dawn Age}}
{{See also|Time of Dragons}}
{{See also|Time of Giants}}

The '''Dawn Age''' was a period lasting from {{Yearlink|-30000}} to {{Yearlink|-24000}}, after the powerful empires of the [[Creator race]]s disappeared from the face of Toril and their land was occupied by [[dragons]] and [[giants]]. Constant war for land in [[Faerûn]] led to the creation of great kingdoms and empires.

===The First Flowering===
{{Main|First Flowering}}

The '''First Flowering''' was a period in Faerûn's history between {{Yearlink|-24000}} and {{Yearlink|-12000}}. At the start of this period, the [[elf|elves]] had split into five major realms: [[Aryvandaar]], [[Illefarn]], [[Keltormir]], [[Miyeritar]] and [[Shantel Othreier]], as well as several smaller ones such as [[Eiellûr]], [[Ilythiir]], [[Orishaar]], [[Syòrpiir]] and [[Thearnytaar]].

It was during this time when the elves cast a [[ritual]] known as the [[First Sundering|Sundering]] to create the [[Evermeet|Isle of Evermeet]], that also resulted in widespread disaster which destroyed or altered much of the world.

===The Founding Time===
{{Main|The Founding Time}}

'''The Founding Time''' was the period when the [[humanoid]] civilizations began to rise, in a time when the many dragons and giants were long overthrown and the [[Crown Wars|elf wars]] no longer loomed over everyone as a threat.

===The Age of Humanity===
{{Main|Age of Humanity}}

The '''Age of Humanity''' was the period from about {{Yearlink|-3000}} to [[1358 DR]]. This period began with the decline of the elven and [[Dwarf|dwarven]] empires and the flourishing and expansion of the [[human]] empires around the world.

===The Present Age===
{{Main|Present Age}}
{{See also|Era of Upheaval}}

The '''Present Age''' was the time period that started in the year [[1000 DR]] and continues to the present. It was considered one of the most tumultuous ages in the history of Toril. It was a time of constant struggle but also a time of discovery and exploration. 

It included such calamitous events like the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], and the [[Second Sundering]] of the decade of the [[1480 DR|1480s DR]].
