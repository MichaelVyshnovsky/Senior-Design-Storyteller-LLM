        "mainbody": "'''''Mulch''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Silvanus]], enabling them to cause wood to instantly rot away.",
        "Effects": "This spell caused wood or organic matter to instantly rot away. Priests of Silvanus exercised extreme care when using this spell. ''Mulch'' could be used for a variety of effects such as causing [[armor]] to fall off of a foe, to break bonds, etc. Wreckless use of this spell would damage vast amounts of nature. The spell was extremely harmful when used against plant-based creatures as well.\n\nIf used against non-plant-based living creatures, the spell caused moisture to withdraw deep within their bodies. This caused no physical harm but did alter the victim's voice and made them appear much older.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast."
