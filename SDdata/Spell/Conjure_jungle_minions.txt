'''''Conjure jungle minions''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to [[priest]]s of the [[Zakhara]]n [[Zakharan pantheon|savage goddess]] [[Ragarra]], and some specialized [[kahin]]s. It temporally transformed very young [[crocodile]]s into [[lesser segarran]]s.

==Effects==
Depending on the power of the priest, this spell created two or more of the humanoid, crocodile-headed [[divine minion]]s of the godess Ragarra called lesser segarrans from baby crocodiles or [[alligator]]s.<ref> The caster directed the actions of the minions, usually to attack their enemies, until they made a kill. The segarrans then consumed any slain victims and only afterwards followed the commands of the priest again. If no opponent was overwhelmed and devoured, the caster often was afflicted with a ''[[Bestow curse|curse]]'', showing Ragarra's disfavor.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of specially blessed fresh water, which the priest poured over the creatures to be transformed.
