Conjure jungle minions was a divine magic spell available to priests of the Zakharan savage goddess Ragarra, and some specialized kahins. It temporally transformed very young crocodiles into lesser segarrans.
Depending on the power of the priest, this spell created two or more of the humanoid, crocodile-headed divine minions of the godess Ragarra called lesser segarrans from baby crocodiles or alligators. The caster directed the actions of the minions, usually to attack their enemies, until they made a kill. The segarrans then consumed any slain victims and only afterwards followed the commands of the priest again. If no opponent was overwhelmed and devoured, the caster often was afflicted with a curse, showing Ragarras disfavor.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of specially blessed fresh water, which the priest poured over the creatures to be transformed.
