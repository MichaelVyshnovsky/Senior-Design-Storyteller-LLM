        "mainbody": "'''''Create portal''''' was an [[alteration]] spell used by [[spelljamming]] mages to open a temporary opening in a [[crystal sphere]] to pass into or out of the [[phlogiston]].",
        "Effects": "If the spellcaster was within {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}} of the surface of a crystal sphere, this spell could cause an area of the sphere {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} in radius to become immaterial, allowing a [[spelljammer|spelljamming vessel]] to pass through. Such a portal would last for at least a couple minutes or as long as almost a quarter of an hour before dissipating, giving a ship plenty of time to pass through safely. However, if the duration ended while a ship were in transition&mdash;or if the spell's [[magic]] was dispelled&mdash;the reformation of the wall of the crystal sphere could cut a ship in half.\n\nA crystal shell was in no way weakened by this temporary magic portal; in fact, if any objects happened to be touching the area of effect, such objects would remain where they were. Multiple vessels could easily follow a first through a created portal.",
        "Components": "''Create portal'' required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s and a [[wire]] wrapped around a piece of [[amber]]."
