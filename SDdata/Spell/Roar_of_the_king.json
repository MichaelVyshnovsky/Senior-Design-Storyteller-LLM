        "mainbody": "'''''Roar of the king''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Nobanion]] called [[Firemane]]s, enabling them to shout with ear-piercing power.",
        "Effects": "This spell boosted the vocal strength of the caster, allowing them to shriek with ear-piercing power like a male [[lion]], temporarily deafening any creature within {{SI|40|ft}} in front of the caster. The roar was so powerful that it would also physically harm targets and shatter brittle equipment on their person.\n\n''Roar of the king'' was not capable of penetrating a ''[[silence, 15' radius]]'' spell. The roar could be heard up to a mile away, making it an effective way raise an alarm. The spell could be cast repeatedly during the same day.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a drop of [[honey]], a piece of [[cinnamon]] bark, a small piece of meat, and a piece of [[amber]] worth at least 20 [[gp]] to cast."
