        "mainbody": "Summon natures ally I was the most basic of the series of summon natures ally spells available to druid and ranger spellcasters.\nThis spell functioned just like all summon natures ally spells, which in turn resembled the summon monster spells. Creatures could only be summoned into an environment in which they could survive (i.e., in which it could move and breathe). Summoned creatures would defend their summoner to the best of their ability, and if the caster could communicate with the summoned creature, then they could give it more complex commands.\nAs the weakest of the summon natures ally spells, it could be used to summon a single dire rat, eagle, monkey, octopus, owl, porpoise, small viper, or wolf.\nThe spell required a divine focus and both verbal and somatic components."
