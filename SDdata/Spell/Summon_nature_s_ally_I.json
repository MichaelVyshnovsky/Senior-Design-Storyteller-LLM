        "Effects": "This spell functioned just like all ''summon nature's ally'' spells, which in turn resembled the ''[[summon monster]]'' spells. Creatures could only be summoned into an environment in which they could survive (''i.e.'', in which it could move and breathe). Summoned creatures would defend their summoner to the best of their ability, and if the caster could communicate with the summoned creature, then they could give it more complex commands.\n\nAs the weakest of the ''summon nature's ally'' spells, it could be used to summon a single [[dire rat]], [[eagle]], [[monkey]], [[octopus]], [[owl]], [[porpoise]], small [[viper]], or [[wolf]].",
        "Components": "The spell required a [[divine focus]] and both [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
