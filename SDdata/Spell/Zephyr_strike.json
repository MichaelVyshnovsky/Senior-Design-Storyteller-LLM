        "mainbody": "Zephyr strike was a transmutation spell used by rangers that conferred the caster with a brief burst of speed and attack accuracy.\nUpon casting this particularly swift spell, the caster could concentrate on a single subsequent attack performed within 1 minute. That attack was granted a magically enhanced accuracy and the caster gained a sudden burst of speed, moving like the wind for a few seconds.\nThe spell required only verbal components."
