        "mainbody": "Sparkling sword was a spell used by clerics of Arvoreen.\nWhen cast, this casters melee weapon, often a sword, began to glow with a sparkling silvery light. The spell increased the damage inflicted by the sword. When the spell expired, the sword was usually ruined. A stronger version of this spell was called blazing sword.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a small amount of sulfur. The sulfur was tossed onto the weapon during casting."
