Shield of faith was a divine abjuration spell that granted greater ability to deflect blows.
Around a touched creature appeared a shimmering, magical field that caused physical attacks to be averted. The strength of this field increased with the power level of the caster.
As well as verbal and somatic components, casting this spell required a small piece of parchment bearing a fragment of a holy text.
