Upsetting onslaught, also sometimes known as binding blast, was a spell used by some warlocks, particularly those of the dark pact.
When upsetting onslaught was cast, the warlock cast a bolt of pure arcane power at a target of his or her choice within fifty feet. If the target failed to resist the bolts effects upon their minds, they dazed into a stupor for a brief moment or took even greater injury. While the spell usually attacked the mind of the opponent, dark pact warlocks could choose instead to attack the body if they viewed it to be more vulnerable.
Upsetting onslaught could be cast with relative ease and reacquired after its casting through a rest of a few minutes or more.
Prior to the Spellplague, upsetting onslaught was known more commonly as binding blast and was able to be cast at-will, rather than once every so often. In virtually all other ways, however, the spell was identical.
