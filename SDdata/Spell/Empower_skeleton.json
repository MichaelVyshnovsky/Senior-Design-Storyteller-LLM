        "mainbody": "'''''Empower skeleton''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[necromancer]]s.",
        "Effects": "A caster used this spell to allow a [[skeleton]] to cast a spell. The skeleton was able to cast a single low-level spell. The spell was conditional, meaning during casting the caster had to outline specific conditions in which the spell was activated and the skeleton cast its empowered spell. The conditions were literal, so a careless caster might accidentally trigger them. The spell had no expiration; years might pass before the conditions were met. Immediately after casting the spell, the caster had to cast the desired spell for the empowerment to take effect. A skeleton was able to hold only a single spell.",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a [[material component]], the ash from a spell's scroll. The scroll had to have at least one active [[arcane]] or [[divine]] spell.",
        "History": "This spell was known to be used by wizards of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]."
