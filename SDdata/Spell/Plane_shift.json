        "mainbody": "'''''Plane shift''''' was an [[alteration]] or [[conjuration]] spell that transported the caster and a few others to a different [[plane of existence]].",
        "Effects": "By means of this spell, the caster and up to seven or eight other beings could be transported to a chosen plane or alternate dimension, including specific layers of multilayer planes. Willing subjects had to form a circle with the caster, holding hands or otherwise maintaining physical contact while the spell was being cast. The caster could also choose to send a single subject to a random location on another plane, but if the subject was unwilling, the caster had to successfully touch the target and the victim had a chance to resist the magic of this spell.\n\nThe earliest version of this spell was quite accurate, placing the travelers at a specific location if desired. Later versions had problems with accuracy, with one version having a maximum error of 500 miles (800 kilometers).",
        "Components": {
            "Planar Forks": "The following table details the forks known to access most planes. \"Material\" is the substance out of which the fork was made, usually metal. For example, in general, [[gold]] led to [[upper planes]], while [[iron]] led to [[lower planes]]. Pure metals were used for [[inner planes]], while alloys of those metals led to the respective [[paraelemental planes]].{{Cite dragon/120/Plane Speaking|42-43}}\n\n\"Pitch\" is the single note to which an individual fork was tuned. If a plane had layers, this note always led to the first layer of that plane. [[Quasi-elemental planes]] could be reached by using a fork tuned sharp for [[Positive energy|positive]] planes and flat for [[Negative energy|negative]] planes. \"Chord\", in the table, indicates that multiple forks were required to ring in harmony. Major chords usually took one to the second layer of a plane, while minor chords took one to the third layer. More complicated harmonies were rumored to be able to reach other layers.\n{{Planar forks}}"

        "History": "In the time of ancient [[Netheril]], divine spells were considered to come from the breath of gods and called \"winds\". This spell was classified as being a [[Transcendent wind]]."
