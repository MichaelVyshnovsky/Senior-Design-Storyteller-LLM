'''''Shield of chains''''' was a spell that created a wall of [[chain]]s.

==Effects==
The spell created a rectangular barrier made of violently flailing force chains, which had the power to move at the caster's direction. Anyone who tried to make it through the barrier would need a minute to break through, and find itself quite battered in the process- even more if the wall fully enveloped them. It was impervious to cold, fire, and electricity, and in fact stopped magical electricity discharges; even further, after being struck by magical flames or electricity, it returned some of that damage to those who were caught in it.

==Components==
Besides [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, it called for two hairs, two links of metal, or one link from a used chain.

==History==
[[Azuth]] made this spell available through [[Elminster]] sometime prior to {{yearlink|1370}}.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|101}}
