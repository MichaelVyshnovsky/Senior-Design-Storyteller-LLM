Feng shui was a spell used by shugenja and wu jen in Kara-Tur.
This spell was similar to detect harmony but with several differences. When cast, the caster was able to sense the influence of an area, up to 50 feet (15 meters) in radius. The caster gained vague insights on what actions were needed depending on the intuition of the caster. This was commonly used to detect the presence of evil in a location. 
This spell required only a somatic component.
