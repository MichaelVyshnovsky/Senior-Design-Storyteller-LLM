Deny cold was an abjuration spell that protected the recipient from natural and magical cold.
While deny cold had the same effect as the divine spell resist cold, it actually repelled cold effects rather than fortified the body of the spells target.
The casting of the spell required verbal and somatic components as well as a patch of fur from an animal.
