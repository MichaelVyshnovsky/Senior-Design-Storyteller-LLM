        "Effects": "This spell created a spherical barrier which protected an area from [[elemental]]s. Elementals were unable to get within 10 feet (3 meters) of the recipient. This protective area moved with the caster. It did not protect the caster from items thrown at them by an elemental, nor ranged weapons.\n\nThe spell protected against:\n* [[Air elemental]]s and similar creature such as [[djinn]] and [[invisible stalker]]s.\n* [[Earth elemental]]s and similar creature such as [[xorn]].\n* [[Fire elemental]]s and similar creature such as [[efreet]] and [[salamander]]s.\n* [[Water elemental]]s and similar creature such as [[triton]]s and [[water weird]]s.",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a material which is not found on either the [[Prime Material Plane]] or any of the [[Elemental Plane]]s."
