        "Effects": "Prior to the [[Spellplague]], this cantrip did a small amount of damage to an undead creature at a range of {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} (farther for more experienced casters) by firing a ray of [[positive energy]] at it. If the target resisted the spell, it had no effect. After the Spellplague, this cantrip instead reduced the protection provided by the dark forces that animated and shielded the undead creature.",
