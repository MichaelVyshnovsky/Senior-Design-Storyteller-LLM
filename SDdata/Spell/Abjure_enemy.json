        "mainbody": "'''''Abjure enemy''''' was a ''[[channel divinity]]'' power granted to [[paladin]]s who had sworn an [[Oath of Vengeance]].",
        "Effects": "This power allowed the paladin to paralyze an enemy with fear for one minute, grounding them in place until attacked or injured. Even the very strong-willed could not completely resist this power, finding their movements to be sluggish even if they were not frozen. The ability was especially potent against the [[undead]] and [[fiend]]s, although it did not function against foes who were immune to mind-influencing [[magic]]s.",
        "Components": "To use this ability, a paladin had to see their foe and present their [[holy symbol]] while uttering a prayer to denounce the target."
