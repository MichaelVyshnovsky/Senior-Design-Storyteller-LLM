        "mainbody": "Greater stone metamorphosis was a transmutation spell that changed one type of stone into another.\nGreater stone metamorphosis was a more complex version of stone metamorphosis and worked exactly like that spell with the same limitations. The difference between these two spells was the amount of affected stone. Greater stone metamorphosis affected massively more of it.\nGreater stone metamorphosis required somatic, verbal, and material components to cast. The material components were a grain of talc and a chip of obsidian. Divine spellcasters had to substitute the material components with a divine focus.\nAt latest by 1372 DR, a kind of magical staff called a staff of stone was developed. The crafting of these staves required among others the casting of a greater stone metamorphosis spell."
