'''''Auril's flowers''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to priests of [[Auril]], the Frostmaiden. It caused an explosion of sharp ice and small stones to burst from the ground in an area designated by the caster.

==Effects==
This spell had to be cast upon moisture-bearing ground within a range of 600 ft (183 m)&mdash;it would not work on terrain that contained no moisture within 3 ft (91 cm) of the surface, such as a dry, sandy desert or solid rock. Higher level casters could extend the range even further and cause more damage. From the target point, all subsurface moisture in a 30 ft (9.1 M) radius instantly froze, causing a violent upwelling of ice and creating a soil-covered mound (known as a [[wikipedia:en:Pingo|pingo]]). This action flung sharp ice shards and chunks of stone throughout the area, causing equal parts physical damage and cold damage. Creatures caught in this barrage could attempt to dodge the worst of it and, if successful, receive only half the damage.

The area affected by this spell became covered in dense rubble

==Components==
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.

==History==
This spell was believed to be recorded in a holy book of Auril called ''[[Revelations of the Icedawn]]'' and was only granted to her clerical and druidic followers.
