        "mainbody": "'''''Whip of flame''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Loviatar]], enabling them to create a fiery [[whip]].",
        "Effects": "This spell created a flaming whip that extended {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} from one of the caster's hands. The whip was a weightless line of force that could be used to strike targets. The flames were merely illusions that could not ignite objects, but could generate enough heat to cause harm especially if the target wore metal armor.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s one of the priest's hairs and a flaming branch, spark, or lump of coal to cast."
