        "mainbody": "Whip of flame was a divine evocation spell used by priests devoted to Loviatar, enabling them to create a fiery whip.\nThis spell created a flaming whip that extended  from one of the casters hands. The whip was a weightless line of force that could be used to strike targets. The flames were merely illusions that could not ignite objects, but could generate enough heat to cause harm especially if the target wore metal armor.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components one of the priests hairs and a flaming branch, spark, or lump of coal to cast."
