Horns of Hathor was a divine alteration spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Hathor called Revered Mothers.
This spell allowed a priestess to grow a pair of horns from her head and gorge her enemies. The priestess could even charge at enemies at least  tall and  away.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a piece of horn from a cow, bull or minotaur to cast.
