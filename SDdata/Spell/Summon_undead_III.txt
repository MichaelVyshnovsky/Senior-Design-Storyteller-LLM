Summon undead III, also known as undead summoning III, was one of the series of summon undead spells available to arcane casters in the Realms.
This spell could summon a huge skeleton, a large zombie, or a ghoul. Usually, the skeleton of an troll or an ogre zombie were chosen. As an alternative, the spell could summon one to three large skeletons, one to three medium-sized zombies, two to five medium-sized skeletons, or two to five small zombies&mdashprovided they were all within 30 feet of each other. 
If a ghoul was summoned, the spell was considered a chaotic spell in addition to an evil one.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a piece of bone from either a ghast, mummy or wight.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
