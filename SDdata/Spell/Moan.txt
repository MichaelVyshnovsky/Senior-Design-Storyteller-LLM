'''''Moan''''' was a haunting [[cantrip]] that beginning [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It created the illusory sound of a pitiful cry or a low wail that sounded as if it was nearby.

==Effects==
This cantrip was a variation of ''[[groan]]'' that produced the auditory illusion of a disembodied voice crying out within a radius of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} from the caster.<ref group="note">The original description of this spell in [[Dragon magazine 60|''Dragon'' #60]] used the 1{{st}}-edition nomenclature <code>1"</code>, meaning {{SI|10|ft}} indoors and {{SI|10|yd}} outdoors. This was simplified to the shorter range in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. The sound could be high and pitiful, perhaps like a child, or low and eerily mournful. The spot chosen for the emanation of the sound could be anywhere within the range, regardless of barriers, walls, or containers. Creatures in the vicinity that could be expected to hear the sound had a chance to resist the spell. If successful, they not aware of the illusion.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster made either a high- or low-pitched sound while pointing at the location from which the cry was to emanate.
