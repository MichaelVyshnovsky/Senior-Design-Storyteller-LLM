        "mainbody": "Smoke shape was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThis spell allowed a wu jen to manipulate fog, mist, or smoke into any shape, though it was was not detailed. The shape maintained its form for the duration of the spell. The spell was often used by wu jen to trick people from a distance. For example, the wu jen would form smoke into the shape of a person, so anyone looking at from a distance would think the wu jen had a companion with them.\nThe components needed to cast this spell were verbal and somatic, and the presence of fog, mist, or smoke."
