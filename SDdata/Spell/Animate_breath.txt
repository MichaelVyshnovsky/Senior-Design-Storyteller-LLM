'''''Animate breath''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[dragons]] that granted [[Dragon breath|their breath]] a brief life and animation.

==Effects==
The spell created a construct out of the caster's breath weapon, instead of having its normal effect. The construct grew in size and power with the magnitude of the user's breath weapon. This construct would then go on to attack the caster's enemies. Depending on the element of the breath weapon, they had different modes of movement; while those based off a fire or cold breath weapon could only walk, acidic ones could swim very quickly, and electricity or sonic ones flew really quickly, with perfect maneauverability. Each of the construct's attacks would be suffused with the breath, but it would deal a fixed damage, independently of the breath's actual strength.

==Components==
Besides its [[somatic component]], ''animate breath'' required a breath weapon to be used alongside the casting.
