'''''Create ancient dead''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Set]] called [[Nighthunter]]s.

==Effects==
This wicked spell violated a carefully preserved and sanctified corpse by transforming it into a [[mummy]]. The type of mummy created depended on what type of person the deceased was in life. Corpses of dark-hearted individuals were transformed into free-willed mummies driven to crazed states until their destruction. Corpses of decent beings became mummies under the control of the caster for several hours, after which the mummy would return to its resting place or collapse to the ground into a lifeless heap.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a scrap from the burial shroud of a free-willed mummy to cast.
