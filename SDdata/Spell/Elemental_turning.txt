Elemental turning was a common spell used by wu jen. The spell was rare outside Kara-Tur, but some elementalists in Faer√ªn had knowledge of this spell.
The spell drove off summoned elementals in a 60-foot (18-meter) radius from the caster. If the elemental was powerful enough, they were able to ignore the spells effects. The spells area of effect was centered on the caster and moved with them. If an elemental was unable to escape the affected area, they escaped onto their plane of existence. The spell only affected one type of elemental at a time, and it did not have a negative affect on the caster who summoned or controlled the elementals.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small amount of the appropriate element.
