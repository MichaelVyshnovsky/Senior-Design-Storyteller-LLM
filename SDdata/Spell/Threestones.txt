Threestones was an offensive wizard spell.
This spell first transformed three smaller stones into fist-sized stones that the caster could hurl straight forward at a target to a rough area of the casters choosingâ€”head, legs, back, etc. The stones were consumed as part of the spell.
The stones would always strike their intended target unless the target was able to take cover or otherwise interpose a barrier in the stones path.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required three small stones to cast.
