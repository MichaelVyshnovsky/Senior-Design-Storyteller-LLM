'''''Threestones''''' was an offensive [[wizard]] [[spell]].

==Effects==
This spell first transformed three smaller stones into fist-sized stones that the caster could hurl straight forward at a target to a rough area of the caster's choosingâ€”head, legs, back, etc. The stones were consumed as part of the spell.

The stones would always strike their intended target unless the target was able to take cover or otherwise interpose a barrier in the stones' path.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required three small stones to cast.
