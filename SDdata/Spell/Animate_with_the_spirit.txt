Animate with the spirit was a type of sanctified spell.
This spell was cast upon the corpse of a creature within  of the caster. The caster had to request that their deity to send the spirit of an outsider. The specific spirit was determined by the deity, not the caster. 
The animated corpse attacked the opponents of the caster. If the caster was capable of communicating with the spirit, they were able to instruct in a limited fashion. Some traits of the outsider persisted in the corpse, such as intelligence. The spirit also had access to the innate natural abilities of the corpse. However, the spirit was not able to use any innate spell-casting abilities or effects that the corpse would possess if alive.
Once the spell expired or the corpse was destroyed, the spirit returned safely to their origin.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a divine focus and a sacrifice of the casters strength.
