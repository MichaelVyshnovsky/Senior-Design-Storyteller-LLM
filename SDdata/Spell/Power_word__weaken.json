        "mainbody": "'''''Power word, weaken''''' was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] from the [[enchantment]] [[school of magic]] that could be cast by both [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "After the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the spell was able to reduce a target's strength. The less the health of the target, the stronger the effect of the spell.\n\nThe spell only worked on creatures under a certain high degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the spellcaster.",
        "Components": "The spell required only a [[verbal component]], which was the uttering of the power word itself.",
        "Usage": "As of the [[1374 DR|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], the spell was used by people in [[Rashemen]]<ref> and [[Samarach]],<ref> and on the [[Dragon Coast]]<ref> and [[Sword Coast North]]."
