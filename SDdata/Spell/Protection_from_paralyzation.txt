'''''Protection from paralyzation''''' was a [[spell]] used by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]].

==Effects==
This spell protected the caster from all forms of paralysis. Muscle and nerve paralysis, including paralysis brought on by a gas, had no effect on the caster. The caster was also protected against spells such as ''[[hold person]]''. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a piece of dried [[carrion crawler]] tentacle. During casting it was crushed then swallowed by the caster.

==History==
The Red Wizards of Thay were known to use this spell before the [[Time of Troubles]]. It was widely believed to have been lost to them afterwards.
