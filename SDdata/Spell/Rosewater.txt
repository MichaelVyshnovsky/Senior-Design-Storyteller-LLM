Rosewater was a divine alteration spell that transformed regular water into a substance beneficial to the clergy of Lathander.
This spell changed a small volume of liquid, no larger than the head of the caster, into rosewater. This rose-pink substance was similar to purified water when drunk by most people and was revitalizing when drunk by Lathanderian clergy and worshipers. It was caustic and harmful if imbibed by evil individuals.
This spell was inscribed within the holy relic called the Tome of the Morning.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the material components of the clerics holy symbol and two rose petals.
