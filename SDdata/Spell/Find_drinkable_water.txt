'''''Find drinkable water''''' was a [[divine]] [[divination]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Mielikki]] that allowed the caster to discern the location of the nearest source of water that was safe to drink.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, the [[cleric]] gained a mental image of, along with the directions and distance to, the nearest available source of water, lying above ground within a distance of {{SI|90|mile|k}}. If no water was to be found above ground, it instead identified the nearest water source below ground, together with an image of the surface directly above. While the spell preferred water that was completely safe to drink, if none was present it did also warn of diseased, poisoned, or tainted water. As a bonus, it also indicated any nearby [[Holy water|holy]] or [[unholy water]] with different-colored auras. However, it did not count water within other substances, such as fruit, alcoholic drinks, blood, or sauces. If no water was available within the spell's range, this fact was indicated to the caster.

The caster retained their vision and their sense of direction to the water source until they arrived at the indicated location, or until they fell asleep.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a single drop of water, dew, or a teardrop that was placed upon the caster's [[holy symbol]].

==History==
The specifications of this spell were inscribed within the holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]], ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'' and a very few other very rare tomes.
