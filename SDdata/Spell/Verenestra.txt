Verenestra was the fey deity of female faeries, charm, and beauty. Verenestra was the daughter of Titania and one of the Inner Circle of the Seelie Court.
Verenestra could choose to appear as a demure, slim female nymph, dryad, or sylph. She was always barefooted, wearing only gossamer garments the size of handkerchiefs to provide her with a semblance of modesty. She stood 4′6″ (1.37 m) in height.
Verenestra was fickle, vain, and jealous she disdained the company of other goddesses of beauty, love, or romance. However, she was also wise enough to know that the security of her worshipers was tied to the security of the fey as a whole. She was utterly loyal to the Seelie Court.
Verenestras avatar could cast wizard spells of the illusion, enchantment, and elemental (excepting fire) schools. She herself was immune to all illusion and enchantment spells, and nonmagical weapons could not harm her. In her sylph form, she could fly in her other two forms, she could swim. She could shift between those three forms instantly, whenever she wished.
Additionally, her avatar could cast charm person, emotion (calm), massmorph, and pass plant at will, and liveoak, mass charm, turn wood, and wall of thorns three times each day.
Verenestra was known to have an enchanted dagger made of the finest silver and studded with moonstones.
Verenestra lived in the Seelie Court, where she had her own bower. The Seelie Court itself was known to wander the planes of Ysgard, Arborea, and the Beastlands.
Verenestras bower was a place of silver birches, larchs, and plane trees, with willows of the fringe, all of which were decorated with silver filigree and jewels. She kept many mirrors within with which to admire herself.
Verenestra rarely left her bower in the Seelie Court, but occasionally left to abduct a particularly charismatic man. At other times, she would accompany other fey deities when a matter of mutual interest was involved.
Verenestra was one of the daughters of Titania, and was presumably the sister, or half-sister, of Damh and the Prince of Frost.
Verenestra was revered primarily by dryads, nymphs, and sylphs. This included the dryads that inhabited Evermeet.
Verenestras holy symbol was a filigree-edged silver mirror.
