Command plants was a divine spell that afforded the caster some degree of control over plants and plant creatures. It was known to druids, clerics with access to the Plant domain, and rangers.
The spell allowed the caster to charm a handful of plant creatures nearby, rendering them friendly and able to communicate with the caster. In order to actually command the plants to do something, the caster had to persuade or compel them to act (not unlike a charm person spell). The plant creatures would not obey highly dangerous or risky commands without added convincing.
A more powerful version of this spell was said to have broader effects. It could be used to mass charm plant or fungus creatures to animate trees, bushes, vines, or other forms of plant life and to mobilize nearby plants to wrap around creatures and objects (thus imitating the entangle spell).This spell underwent a major revision between 3rd edition and 3.5 edition in which the scope of its effects were greatly reduced and its level was dropped from 8 to 4. It may have been either confused for or remixed with control plants.
The spell required only verbal components.
The spell was favored among the blightlords of Talona during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
