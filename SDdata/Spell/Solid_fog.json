It could even slow the descent of something falling through it.\nThe solid fog would dissipate as a normal fog in a severe wind, and could not be cast underwater.\nA permanency spell made a solid fog permanent and continually reforming.\nA casting of solid fog required a mixture of a pinch of powdered hoof from some animal, and a pinch of powdered dried peas.\nThe spell was created by the arcanist Veridon of Netheril, ruler of the enclave of Lathery. He introduced it in 3408 NY (−451 DR) under the name Veridons solidifier. It later became known simply as solid fog.\nSolid fog was an uncommon spell in Faerûn in the 1360s DR."
