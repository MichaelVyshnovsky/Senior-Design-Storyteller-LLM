Darssons cooling breeze was a spell unique to Halruaa.
Similar to, but less powerful than, the gust of wind spell, this spell was used to create peaceful air currents centered on a object. This was a popular spell within the hot and humid land of Halruaa.
Once cast, the air moved in a slow circle around the object for many hours, making it perfect for cooling down a warm room with a cool breeze.
This spell required a dried legume to cast.
