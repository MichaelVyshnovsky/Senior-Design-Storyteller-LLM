        "mainbody": "Hide was a legerdemain cantrip that initiate wizards could learn. It temporarily rendered one object or creature invisible to an audience.\nThis cantrip was only effective for viewers in front of the caster and ineffective for anyone standing behind or beside the caster. The maximum duration of this minor illusion was ten minutes for a target of size  or less, and proportionally less as the volume of the target increased. For example, a  object could be hidden for up to nine minutes,  for one minute,  for 30 seconds, and so on, with objects above  only flickering out briefly before reappearing. This cantrip did not mask scents, mute sounds, or hide footprints. The spell could be deactivated by speaking the magic word a second time.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster spoke a magic word (such as abracadabra) while waving a hand over the front of the target object or creature."
