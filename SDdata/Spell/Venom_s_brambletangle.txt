'''''Venom's brambletangle''''' was a [[spell]] that could only be cast by [[dragon]]s.

==Effects==
The spell had to be cast in an area with brambles, briars, or thorn bushes present. After casting, the spell transformed the existing bramble into a dense thicket, so dense it made moving impossible. The spell also created more thorns, so not only could a trapped creature not move, they were constantly pricked by thorns.

==Casting==
This spell required only a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component.

==History==
This spell was created by the [[green dragon]] [[Venominhandar]]. The spell was used by his descendant, green dragon turned [[dracolich]] [[Dretchroyaster]]. Legend said that Venominhandar used this spell along with ''[[Venom's thicketgrowth]]'' to alter the Emerald Vale into the [[Tangled Vale]].
