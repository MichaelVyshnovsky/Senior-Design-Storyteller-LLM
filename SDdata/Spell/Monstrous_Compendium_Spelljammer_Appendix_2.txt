{{Quote|''Prepare to be boarded!'' Here are still more new, inventive, dangerous, and entertaining creatures and races for your SPELLJAMMERâ„¢ campaign setting! There are giant undead insects, star gypsies, space plants, and much, much more awaiting your stellar travelers in these pages. [[Elven]] war-beasts, giant space turtles, [[orc]]ish death-creatures, and other beings of the [[phlogiston]], crystal spheres, and [[wildspace]] roam this volume. Some look nasty, and are; some look nasty, and aren't. Which are which? Read the entries and find out for yourself! And of course, they are organized into five-hole-punched pages that fit right into your Monstrous Compendium binders.}}
