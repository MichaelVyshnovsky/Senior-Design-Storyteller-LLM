        "Effects": "Within the area of a ''consecrate'' effect, a [[cleric]]'s ability to [[turn undead]] was enhanced. Any [[undead]] creature in the vicinity was weakened and more vulnerable to magical effects. The area was also proof against creating or summoning undead in the area while the spell was in effect. This spell covered a spherical area with a radius of {{SI|20|ft}} and lasted six hours. The duration of the spell was determined by the caster's skill level.\n\nThis spell was doubly effective if it covered a permanent structure such as an altar or a shrine dedicated to the caster's deity, an allied deity in the same pantheon, or a higher power of the same alignment as the caster. If cast on a fixture dedicated to a deity that was not compatible with these restrictions, it cursed the area instead, causing it to lose any benefits or connection with its patron deity while the spell was in effect. An area so cursed did not gain the benefits versus undead. ''Consecrate'' countered and was countered by ''[[desecrate]]''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the use of the caster's [[holy symbol]], a vial of [[holy water]], and at least {{SI|5|lbs}} of [[silver]] dust with a value of at least 25 [[gp]]. During casting the holy water and silver dust had to be sprinkled over the area to be consecrated."
