        "mainbody": "A hexblade was an arcane spellcaster who combined magical power with martial skill. A hexblades power could manifest itself spontaneously, similarly to a sorcerers magic,\nHexblade warlocks trained even more thoroughly in the martial arts than other warlocks, mastering use of a broader variety of weapons and the ability to effectively fight in heavier armor. They were also able to closely attune themselves to a weapon instead of needing great strength or dexterity to effectively wield a weapon it would become an extension of their charismatic will, the same source of strength for their spells, making them exceptionally deadly fighters.\nIf a bargain was made between a warlock and a being from the Shadowfell, the warlocks patron gave them access to certain powers, including a suite of spells that expanded the choices to fill their spell slots.\nOne of the benefits hexblades received from their patron was access to more spells from which to choose, beginning with the defensive shield and the offensive wrathful smite. After some advancement, the hexblade could choose to blur themselves with shadows or use branding smite to reveal an opponent hiding in shadow. Next, a hexblade warlock could use the blink spell to confound their enemies or charge their weapon with an elemental force for a time. At the next level of advancement they could learn to play mind tricks with phantasmal killer or staggering smite. And finally, when sufficiently advanced, a hexblade could infuse a weapon with enough power to blast a creature off the plane for a time or chill them to the bone with cone of cold.\n* Orielen, a hexblade involved in the Zhentarim invasion of Shadowdale in .\n* Sithierel, a shadar-kai hexblade from the Shadowfell."
