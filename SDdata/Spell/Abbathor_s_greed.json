        "mainbody": "Abbathors greed was a spell used by clerics of Abbathor.\nWith this spell, the caster could find the most valuable item within range. The spell has an area of effect  wide and a minimum of  in length. The spell detected the value of the material of an item. The spell gave the caster the ability to instantly know the exact monetary value of an item.\nThe more valuable the item detected, the bigger the chance that Abbathor himself will take personal interest in the item and desire it. In such a case, he would send an avatar to retrieve the item. It was in the casters best interest to obey the avatar.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components."
