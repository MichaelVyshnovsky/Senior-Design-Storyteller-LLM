        "mainbody": "Gauntlet of winds was a divine alteration and evocation spell used by priests devoted to Shaundakul, enabling them to enchant their gauntlet.\nThis spell allowed the caster to imbue their gauntlet with several magical properties including feather fall, gust of wind, wind wall, or calm winds. Each effect would last for one minute unless that power was selected again. The spell would lapse if the casters concentration was broken.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the casters holy symbol to cast."
