Fire storm was an evocation spell that filled  an area with sheets of flame.
This spell blasted all creatures within the area with fire similar to a wall of fire, causing damage for a short time.
Some older versions had a reverse the spell, fire quench, that extinguished an equal area of magical fire, or double the area of normal fire.
This spell required verbal and Somatic components.
The arcane version of fire storm was originally common only to the Red Wizards of Thay.
