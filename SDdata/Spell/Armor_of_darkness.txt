'''''Armor of darkness''''' was a spell available to [[cleric]]s with the [[Darkness domain]]. Earlier versions were the purview of priests of [[Shar]].

==Effects==
When cast, the spell enclosed a target creature with a cloak of shifting shadows. This cloak afforded the target creature protection from attacks as well as minimal resistance against certain spells and effects, including any good, holy or light spell. The cloak was also able to hide the target creature's distinguishing features. The target creature was able to see through the cloak. The spell also gave the target creature the ability of [[darkvision]]. If this spell was cast on an [[undead]] creature, they were able to resist being [[Turn undead|turned]].

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.

==History==
''Armor of darkness'' was first known to the [[Nightcloak]] priests of [[Shar]] in [[Netheril]]. However, by [[1372 DR]], the clerics of [[Lolth]], [[Mask]], [[Set]], and [[Shargass]] had also gained knowledge and use of this spell.
