Misdirection was an illusion spell that could confuse divination spells trying to read the auras of a person or an object.
Misdirection was a spell that as cast on a creature or an object and a second object was chosen within range. The beneficiary of the spell repelled divination spells such as detect evil, detect magic, discern lies, etc. to the second object. The divination spells worked, just on the second object. For example the target of misdirection could become the target of discern lies, but the second spell discerned whether a tree, which was chosen for the misdirection was lying without realizing it, while the target was free to lie.
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. Another person, creature, or object had to be nearby the subject to be obfuscated.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Enollar in  and was originally called Enollars aimlessness.
