Greater shadow evocation, also known as demi-shadow magic (or demishadow magic) and Shadows demimagic, was an illusion spell that created semi-real duplicates of arcane evocation spells. It was a superior version of the shadow evocation spell.
The spell enabled the caster to tap into the energies of the Plane of Shadow to create shadowy imitations of powerful spells such as cone of cold, wall of fire, wall of ice, cloudkill, and the like.
If a target recognized an offensive spell to be an illusion, that spell lost much of its potency.
The spell used verbal and somatic components only.
The spell was originally devised by the Netherese arcanist known as Shadow in 3272 NY (âˆ’587 DR), and was originally called Shadows demimagic. This was simplified to demishadow magic by the mid-to-late 14 century DR, It ultimately came to be known as greater shadow evocation.
The spell was a favorite of cloaker lords.
