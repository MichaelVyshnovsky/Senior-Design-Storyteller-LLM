Older versions of disintegrate made the target disappear no matter if it was a creature, or magical matter, or a 1" cubic volume of other material.
The newer versions spell struck and injured a target, and if killed, the ray caused the creature to disintegrate into a pile of fine dust, although any equipment was not affected. The ray could also disintegrate as much as one 10-foot-cube of nonliving matter, even objects constructed entirely of force, but it could not affect magical effects, such as a globe of invulnerability. Only one creature or object could be affected per casting.
