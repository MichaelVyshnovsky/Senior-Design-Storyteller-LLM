'''''Imprisonment''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that could imprison subjects, such as entombing them beneath the earth.

==Effects==
This incredibly powerful spell took a whole minute to cast, and could only be cast at opponents up to {{SI|30|ft}} away. Such a spell was cast, the opponent became imprisoned in a way chosen by the caster. The target could either be buried beneath the earth, chained to the ground, sent to a [[demiplane]], shrunk and stored in a [[gem]], or put to a state of sleep that they could not wake from. Whilst imprisoned, the targets did not need to eat, drink, and breathe, and they did not age.

The reversed form of this spell, ''[[freedom]]'', was used to release an ''imprisoned'' creature from its confinement. Detailed knowledge of the prisoner to free was required, otherwise the caster risked setting loose other entombed creatures.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]] and material components. The specific material depended on the form of imprisonment the caster wished to inflict on the target, but in addition to that all versions required either a small carved statue in the likeness of the target or a depiction of the target on [[calfskin]].

==History==
The spell was credited to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Yong]] in {{Yearlink|-1674}} and was originally called '''''Yong's imprison'''''.
