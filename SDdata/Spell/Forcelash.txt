Forcelash was a spell that was first developed by the phaerimms.
When cast, a long whip of energy was created at the end of the casters arm or other limb chosen during casting. This powerful whip was controlled by the casters willpower and was able to attack a target within  of the caster. The whip was strong enough to penetrate some barrier or protection spells like shield. When struck, the targeted creature became immobile and was wracked with painful spasm as energy coursed through their body.
This spell required verbal and somatic components.
