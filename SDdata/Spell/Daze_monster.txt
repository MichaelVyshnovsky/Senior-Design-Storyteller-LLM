'''''Daze monster''''' was an [[arcane]] [[enchanment]] [[spell]] that could daze a creature.

==Effects==
Similar to ''[[daze]]'', this spell could cloud the mind of any close-by creature, provided it was alive and no more than moderately powerful, and could not resist through an act of will. It prevented them from acting for several seconds, though they could defend themselves adequately.

==Components==
It required a pinch of wool of the like as a [[material component]], in addition to its [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.

==Usage==
Some 'curtains of darkness' in [[Undermountain]] could affect those who passed through with a ''daze monster''.<ref>
