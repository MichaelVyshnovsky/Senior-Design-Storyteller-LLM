        "mainbody": "'''''Bloodspear''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] known to [[orc]] [[cleric]]s of [[Gruumsh]].",
        "Effects": "''Bloodspear'' allowed its caster to touch a [[spear]], Gruumsh's favored weapon, and instill the god's anger into it, turning it into a ''[[wounding (weapon quality)|wounding]] spear''. The [[magic]] caused the spear tip to ooze blood. \n\nThis spell expired 6 seconds after the spear left the caster's hand. Therefore, the spear could be thrown and still harm the target with the ''wounding'' quality.",
        "Components": "''Bloodspear'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s.",
        "History": "''Bloodspear'' was only available for clerics of Gruumsh and even among them only to those who were initiated in the faith's secrets."
