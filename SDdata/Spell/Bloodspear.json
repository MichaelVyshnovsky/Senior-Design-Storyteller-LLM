        "mainbody": "Bloodspear was a transmutation spell known to orc clerics of Gruumsh.\nBloodspear allowed its caster to touch a spear, Gruumshs favored weapon, and instill the gods anger into it, turning it into a wounding spear. The magic caused the spear tip to ooze blood. \nThis spell expired 6 seconds after the spear left the casters hand. Therefore, the spear could be thrown and still harm the target with the wounding quality.\nBloodspear required somatic and verbal components.\nBloodspear was only available for clerics of Gruumsh and even among them only to those who were initiated in the faiths secrets."
