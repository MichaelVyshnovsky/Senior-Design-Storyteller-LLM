An incantatrix, also known as an incantatar for males or the gender-neutral (but less accurate) metamage,
Throughout their extensive training, incantatrixes assumed a number of ranked titles, including dweomaedar, memurge, weirworker, and spellbinder.
The majority of incantatrixes were female, mostly skilled wizards or sorcerers along with a small number of bards. Very few clerics or druids explored this path as they relied on extraplanar entities, which strongly conflicted with the incantatrixs methods.
Many of their kind chose to live in solitude, often exhibiting feelings of paranoia in regards to other people. In the same way that druids protected the forest or other stretch of natural land, so to did incantatrixes protected the area around their home from unrestrained or extraplanar use of magic.

Incantatrixes were especially potent at banishing outsiders. These powers could also be used to dispel any monsters that were summoned through spells.

More advanced training in their arts allowed these casters to "steal" spells from other mages while they were deep in concentration, and even take away control of spell effects after they have been released. Some of the more powerful incantatrixes could even drain certain magic items of their arcane charges, and use the dweomers to heal their own bodies.
The most experienced incantatrixes who mastered metamagic could wield their powers with great efficiency. They did not have to expend the same mental resources as their less experienced counterparts.

Before the , incantatrixes had specialized in their own distinct school of incantation.
