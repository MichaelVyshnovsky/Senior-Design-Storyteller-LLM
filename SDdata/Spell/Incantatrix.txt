An '''incantatrix''', also known as an '''incantatar''' for males or the gender-neutral (but less accurate) '''metamage''',

Throughout their extensive training, incantatrixes assumed a number of ranked titles, including 'dweomaedar', 'memurge', 'weirworker', and 'spellbinder'.

==Culture==
The majority of incantatrixes were female, mostly skilled [[wizard]]s or [[sorcerer]]s along with a small number of [[bard]]s. Very few [[cleric]]s or [[druid]]s explored this path as they relied on extraplanar entities, which strongly conflicted with the incantatrix's methods.

Many of their kind chose to live in solitude, often exhibiting feelings of paranoia in regards to other people. In the same way that [[druid]]s protected the forest or other stretch of natural land, so to did incantatrixes protected the area around their home from unrestrained or extraplanar use of magic.

==Abilities==
Due to the area of magic in which incantatrixes studied, they gained the benefits of being specialized in the [[school of magic|school]] of [[abjuration]]. 

Incantatrixes immediately begin their studies in metamagic, learning to ''[[read magic]]'', identify spells as they were being cast,

Incantatrixes were especially potent at banishing [[outsider]]s. These powers could also be used to ''[[dispel magic|dispel]]'' any ''[[Summon monster|monsters that were summoned through spells]]''.

With a hardy spirit, the incantatrix became immune to [[death magic]] and effects that drained life energy. Over time they even gained a sort of affinity into the [[ethereal plane]], allowing them to see into that realm and strike out against ethereal beings with their magic. 

More advanced training in their arts allowed these casters to "steal" spells from other [[mage]]s while they were deep in concentration, and even take away control of spell effects after they have been released. Some of the more powerful incantatrixes could even drain certain [[:Category:magic items|magic items]] of their arcane charges, and use the dweomers to heal their own bodies.

The most experienced incantatrixes who mastered metamagic could wield their powers with great efficiency. They did not have to expend the same mental resources as their less experienced counterparts.

==History==
Circa the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], there were only seven verified incantatrixes and two incantatars known throughout all the Realms of [[Faerûn]], though it was suspected that as many as a hundred lived undetected.

Before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, incantatrixes had specialized in their own distinct school of [[incantation]].

==Rumors & Legends==
It was speculated that the person known as [[The Mage of the Stars]] was actually an incantatar.
