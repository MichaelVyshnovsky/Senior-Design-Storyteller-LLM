        "mainbody": "Morgannavers sting was a necromancy spell used by wizards. This spell was developed by Morgannaver.\nThis spell allowed the caster to heal themselves by siphoning the health or vitality from creatures they touched. The spell would be lost if more than three minutes passed without touching a target. Casting another spell would also cause the spell to instantly fail. Once Morgannavers sting was active the first creature touched would be harmed regardless of the casters intentions. Any touched creatures were wracked with intense pain for several minutes.\nThis spell did not work against the undead or creatures whose lifeforce was based in the Negative Material Plane.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
