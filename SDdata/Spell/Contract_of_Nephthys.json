        "mainbody": "'''''Contract of Nephthys''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priestesses devoted to [[Nephthys]] called [[Goodwive]]s.\n\nThis spell was used commonly during business dealings in [[Mulhorand]]. The [[Church of Nephthys]] usually demanded 1â€“5% of any profits made by such contracts.",
        "Effects": "This spell bound two willing parties into a specific agreement, the breaking of which held severe consequences. All of the specific terms of the contract were recited by the caster during casting. If a party failed to meet the terms of the contract despite their best efforts to do so, then the hand of Nephthys would ensure their business did not make a profit. Any party deliberating breaking any of the contract terms would find their business and all wealth crushed by Nephthys into dust and bankruptcy.\n\nAll penalties incurred by the contract would expire one year after the spell was cast regardless of when the penalty occurred. The original caster could remove the contract early under special circumstances.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a hair from each participant and a handful of [[gold]] dust worth at least 100 [[gp]] to cast."
