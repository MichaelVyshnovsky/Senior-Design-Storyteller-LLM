'''''Empathy''''' was a minor [[psionic]] devotion that allowed a [[psion]]

==Effects==
This discipline allowed a psion to detect and sense a multitude of different surface emotions, drives, and moods. These could include hatred, hostility, curiosity, friendliness, love, rage, uncertainty, and the like. It also allowed a psion to detect various sensations, such as pain, and basic needs like fatigue, hunger, and thirst.

Reports differed on the exact effective range of this devotion. Older accounts spoke of it being unlimited in its range, but limited to a {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} by {{SI|20|ft}} area, and requiring physical contact if used against another psionicists. Later accounts spoke of its range instead being centered on the caster and spreading out {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}.

Psionic defenses such as ''[[mind bar]]'', as well as [[spell]]s like ''[[mind blank]]'', could shield against it.

==Display==
Manifesting this power produced a standard mental [[display]].
