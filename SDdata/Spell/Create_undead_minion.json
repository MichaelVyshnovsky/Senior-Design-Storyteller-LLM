        "mainbody": "'''''Create undead minion''''' was an [[alteration]]/[[necromancy]] spell that formed a single [[undead]] creature, made from either a corpse or the body of a living person.\n\nThis spell was only available to the clergies of [[evil]]-[[alignment|aligned]] deities.",
        "Effects": "If ''create undead minion'' was cast upon corpse, there was a chance it transformed it into a [[ghoul]]. The body had to come from an individual that had died within a day prior to the spell's casting.\n\nIf it was cast upon a living person, the spell transformed them into a more powerful undead being, such as a [[ghast]], [[wight]], or, in the case of extremely powerful evil clerics, a [[vampire]]. This transformation took the spell's entire 10-minute casting time to take effect. During this time, the spell's effects could be ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' or otherwise negated by disrupting the caster.\n\nThe ''undead minion'' created by this spell was fully under the command of the casting cleric. If they died, the undead creature was destroyed or granted free will.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, ''create undead minion'' required a number of [[material component]]s: the [[holy symbol]] of the casting cleric, soil taken from a cemetery, and a fingernail taken from the type of undead the caster wished to create."
