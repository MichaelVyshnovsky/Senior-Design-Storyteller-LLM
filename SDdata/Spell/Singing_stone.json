        "mainbody": "Singing stone was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Milil, enabling them to trap a song within a stone.\nThis spell allowed the caster to place a short tune of three breaths or less within a stone. The song would be heard whenever the stone was placed under water or tapped, repeating every ten minutes if still submerged. The music stored could only be that composed of sounds made directly by the caster either with their voice or by playing an instrument. If vocals were present in the song it would sound just like the caster when heard through the stone. This spell could not be used to record the music or voice of others and even eliminated any background noise from the casters music.\nIn addition to verbals and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a chime to cast.\nTemples of Milil were known to store entire libraries full of stones stored with music by use of this spell."
