        "Effects": "On a successful touch, this spell revitalized undead creatures or had a withering effect on the living. This spell was about twice as powerful as ''[[inflict light wounds]]'' but otherwise operated in the same manner.\n\nThe older version of this spell was not as potent as the newer version but could knock back foes with possibly critical results on a successful attack. Plus, it was reversible (called ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'') for use in healing the living."
