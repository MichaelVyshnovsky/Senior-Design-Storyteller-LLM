Wind blade was a spell used by wizards in Anauroch and Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell created a wind-made invisible sword that the caster could instantly extend and retract from his hand. The wind blade was not actually held in the casters hand, so he could hold something else while using the weapon. The blade sounded like roaring wind when swung and bludgeoned targets with force.
This spell did not require physical components to cast.
