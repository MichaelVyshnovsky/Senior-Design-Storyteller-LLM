        "Effects": "This spell considerably weakened any structure submerged in water. It was commonly used on ships at sea. This spell could create a gaping hole in the side of a ship or just several leaks depending on the inherent strength of the wood.\n\n[[Spelljammer]]s were generally safe from the effects of this spell, as they traveled through the [[phlogiston]] rather than water.",
        "Components": "This spell required a thin glass needle to cast."
