'''''Summon swarm''''' was a [[conjuration]] spell that conjured a swarm of small crawling or flying creatures.

==Effect==
When cast, ''summon swarm'' caused a swarm of tiny creatures to cover an area, attacking any other creature they encountered. Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the swarm is impossible. The caster has no choice as to what type of creature he summons; typical swarms include [[rat]]s, [[bat]]s, poisonous [[spider]]s, centipedes, and flying beetles.

The swarm cannot be fought effectively with weapons, but fire and damaging area effects can force it to disperse. Certain area or effect spells, such as ''[[gust of wind]]'' and ''[[stinking cloud]]'', disperse a swarm immediately if appropriate to the swarm summoned. (For example, only fliers are affected by a ''gust of wind''.)

The swarm is stationary once summoned, not leaving the original area. A [[druid]] caster, however, can direct the swarm to move up to thirty feet every few seconds (or ninety feet if she has summoned bats or beetles).

==Components==
It needed [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, a [[divine focus]] for divine casters, and a square of red cloth as a [[material component]] for arcane casters.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Jarm]]  in {{Yearlink|-1915}} and was originally called ''Jarm's summon swarm''.

Around the 13{{th}} century [[DR]], a pirate-mage by the name of [[Respitil]] sailed the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and was known to cast the ''summon swarm'' spell to have biting, stinging insects devour their captives that were bound to the mainmast.<ref>

The so-called "ruby [[Gem dragon|dragon]]" [[Chenowyn]], once [[Zaranda Star]]'s apprentice and charge, could innately cast this spell. She once used it to save Zaranda's life, when the latter was [[Hold person|held]] by [[Whimberton]]'s magic, during the attack on [[Castle Lutwill]] before the start of the [[Reclamation Wars]]. Chenowyn's version of the spell called forth tiny, shimmering lights with indistinct shapes. The swarm caused Whimberton to fall from a window to his death four stories below.

In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''summon swarm'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}
