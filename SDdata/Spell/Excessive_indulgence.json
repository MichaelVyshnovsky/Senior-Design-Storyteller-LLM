        "mainbody": "Excessive indulgence was a divine enchantment spell used by specialty priests devoted to Sharess called Sensates, enabling them to distract a target by forcing them to over focus on their current activity.\nThis spell forced the target to focus on their current activity to a point of excessive indulgence, preventing them from taking any course of action other than repeatedly performing their current activity. An attack on the target during this time would cancel the spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the material components required for this spell were the priests holy symbol and three freshly picked flower petals."
