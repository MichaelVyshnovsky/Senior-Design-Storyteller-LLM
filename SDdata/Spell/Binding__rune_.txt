Binding was a type of giant rune that allowed one to befriend animals.
Once the appropriate object inscribed with the rune was placed upon a creature of animal or semi-intelligence, that creature would be affected as though they were under the spell animal friendship. Upon removal of the runed object this effect on the creature would be broken.
Like most giant runes, it required no material components to cast. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to six hours and it needed to be inscribed upon an object that would be worn by an animal, such as a collar or saddle.
