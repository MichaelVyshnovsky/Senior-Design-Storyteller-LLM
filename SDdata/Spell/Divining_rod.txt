'''''Divining rod''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] and [[wizard]]s, primarily [[artificer]]s and [[diviner]]s.

==Effects==
A caster used this spell when attempting to locate an item or forces of nature that were hidden from view. During casting, the caster stated what they desired to find. If located within the area of effect of the spell, the rod pointed directly at the item, and pulled the caster to it. If an obstacle blocked was between the caster and the item, the rod pressed against it. A caster commonly used this spell to locate water, stolen items or treasure.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a Y-shaped wand made from the wood of a [[ginkgo]] tree or fruit tree. The caster grasped the wand with both hands for the duration of the spell.
