The spell protected the caster from any adverse effects from touching an undead creature.\n\nThe reversed version of this spell was called ''drain undead'' and hurt undead creatures. While the name of this spell included ''drain'', the spell did not convert the drained energy from an undead into a beneficial force for the caster. This version also protected the caster like ''undead regeneration''.\n\nBoth versions allowed only undead creatures as targets.",
