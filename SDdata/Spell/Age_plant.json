        "mainbody": "Age plant was a divine magic spell available to priests.\nWhen cast, the spell affected the natural aging process of plants, including seeds and trees. The caster could alter the aging process backwards or forwards with the changes occurring instantaneously. Therefore a caster could use this spell to make a seed sprout or to reduce a fully grown tree to a sapling.\nThe spell did not affect magical plants nor plant-based creatures. The spell also did not change the appearance or basic characteristics of the targeted plant other than the natural process of aging.\nWhile casting the spell, the caster had to determine whether to age the target backwards or forwards. The caster could affect up to 10 years of age, this time limit increased as the caster reached higher skill levels.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, a single petal from an apple blossom as well as the casters holy symbol.\nThis spell was inscribed within the Kelemvorite relic the Testament of Vraer and in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki."
