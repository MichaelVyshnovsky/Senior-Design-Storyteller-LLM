'''''Otiluke's resilient sphere''''' ({{Pronounce|O|ti|look|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that imprisoned its target. To [[Zakhara]]n mages, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''resilient sphere''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].

==Effect==
The spell created a shimmering sphere of [[force]], with a diameter of a number of feet according to the power of the caster. If large enough, it completely enclosed a nearby target creature, if they could not dodge it or resist the spell. The ''resilient sphere'' would contain its subject for the duration of the spell, on the order of minutes.

Nothing could pass through the ''sphere'', in or out, but the prisoner could still breathe. The ''sphere'' could not be moved, by either actions or efforts inside. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe was completely safe from all attacks, but, at the same time, was completely unable to affect the outside world.

The ''sphere'' was completely immune to all damage. The only method of removing the ''sphere'' (short of its caster dismissing it) was by the use of a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell, an item like a ''[[rod of cancellation]]'' or a ''[[rod of negation]]'', or even a ''[[disintegrate]]''; these would destroy the ''sphere'' and leave the prisoner inside unharmed.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a hemisphere of transparent [[Rock crystal|crystal]] and a hemisphere of [[gum arabic]], both the same size.

==History==
The ''resilient sphere'' was not known to the mages of ancient [[Netheril]].
