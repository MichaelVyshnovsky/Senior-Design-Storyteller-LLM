Otilukes resilient sphere () was an evocation spell that imprisoned its target. To Zakharan mages, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as resilient sphere, and counted among the spells of the universal province.
The spell created a shimmering sphere of force, with a diameter of a number of feet according to the power of the caster. If large enough, it completely enclosed a nearby target creature, if they could not dodge it or resist the spell. The resilient sphere would contain its subject for the duration of the spell, on the order of minutes.
Nothing could pass through the sphere, in or out, but the prisoner could still breathe. The sphere could not be moved, by either actions or efforts inside. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe was completely safe from all attacks, but, at the same time, was completely unable to affect the outside world.
The sphere was completely immune to all damage. The only method of removing the sphere (short of its caster dismissing it) was by the use of a dispel magic spell, an item like a rod of cancellation or a rod of negation, or even a disintegrate these would destroy the sphere and leave the prisoner inside unharmed.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a hemisphere of transparent crystal and a hemisphere of gum arabic, both the same size.
The resilient sphere was not known to the mages of ancient Netheril.
