'''''Spell echo''''' was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] of the [[illusion]] [[school of magic]] that revealed previous spells used within a given area.

==Effects==
The spell created an illusion that depicted the operation, or unleashing, of a previous spell, so long as it was cast within the once-encompassed area of effect of that spell. Multiple castings of the spell allowed a mage to sort through different spells cast in the same space, and it was possible to cast the spell to recall a given spell more than once.

The illusion wasn't devised by the caster, and so it was allowed as evidence in some legal proceedings. The spell only worked in [[Realmspace]].

==Components==
The spell required only a [[somatic component]].

==History==
The spell existed since the time of [[Myth Drannor]],{{Cite dragon annual/1997/The magic of Myth Drannor}} a fact known to [[Elminster]].{{Cite dragon/238/The Return of the Wizards Three|44}} He had used it to taunt [[Delmuth Echorn]] after destroying the [[sword]] the elf threw at him.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|169|8}}
