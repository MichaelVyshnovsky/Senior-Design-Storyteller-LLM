Spell echo was an arcane spell of the illusion school of magic that revealed previous spells used within a given area.
The spell created an illusion that depicted the operation, or unleashing, of a previous spell, so long as it was cast within the once-encompassed area of effect of that spell. Multiple castings of the spell allowed a mage to sort through different spells cast in the same space, and it was possible to cast the spell to recall a given spell more than once.
The illusion wasnt devised by the caster, and so it was allowed as evidence in some legal proceedings. The spell only worked in Realmspace.
The spell required only a somatic component.
The spell existed since the time of Myth Drannor, a fact known to Elminster. He had used it to taunt Delmuth Echorn after destroying the sword the elf threw at him.
