Weighty chest was an alteration spell that made an object extremely difficult to move when touched by someone other than the caster.
The caster had to touch the object to cast this spell. The object could be a chest, a book, a box, a present, a small chest of drawers, a bookshelf, or any non-living movable object that fit in a  cube. Whenever one or more creatures touched the object, the weight of the object increased in proportion to (and at least double) the combined weight of all those touching it. This spell lasted at least one day and more advanced priests could make it last many more days.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, his spell required a small lead ball to cast.
