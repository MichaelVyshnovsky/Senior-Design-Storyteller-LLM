        "mainbody": "'''''Reincarnate''''' was a [[transmutation]] or [[necromantic]] spell that returned a dead creature's soul to a new body.",
        "Effects": "This spell required the caster to touch at least some piece of the dead creature's body that was part of the creature at the time of death; that was not [[undead]], had not died of old age, or been killed by a death effect; The soul also had to be free and willing to return. If all these criteria were met, then a new body was formed out of the natural environment where the spell was cast and the soul took up residence in it, being a young adult of whatever species appeared. This process took an hour to complete and occurred without any possibility of system shock.\n\nThe arcane version of this spell required the corpse to have been dead no longer than a matter of days, according to the experience of the wizard.\n\nSome possible incarnations for humanoid subjects were: [[badger]], [[bear]], [[boar]], [[bugbear]], [[centaur]], [[dryad]], [[dwarf]], [[eagle]], [[elf]], [[faun]], [[fox]], [[gnoll]], [[gnome]], [[goblin]], [[half-elf]], [[half-orc]], [[halfling]],  [[hawk]], [[hobgoblin]], [[human]], [[kobold]], [[lizardfolk]], [[lynx]], [[orc]], [[owl]], [[pixie]], [[raccoon]], [[satyr]], [[stag]], [[troglodyte]], [[wolf]], and [[wolverine]].\n\nA ''[[wish]]'' or a ''[[miracle]]'' could restore a reincarnated character to its original form.\n\nThe reincarnated soul remembered most of its past life and retained the knowledge of skills and abilities, but the limitations of the new body could prevent the effective use of those skills. It was difficult to fire a bow without opposable thumbs or cast spells without hands for the somatic components, for example. On the other hand, the new body had all the physical capabilities of its kind.",
        "Components": "In addition to the verbal and somatic components of this spell, the caster needed a [[divine focus]] or [[holy symbol]] and at least 1,000 [[gp]] worth of rare oils and unguents to anoint the remains. Some traditions encouraged the burning of rare incense to increase the chances of getting a humanoid body for the soul to inhabit.\n\nThe arcane version of this spell required a small [[drum]] and a drop of blood.",
        "History": "The arcane version of the spell was first introduced by the [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Sadebreth]] in {{Yearlink|-2475}} as '''''Sadebreth's reincarnation''''' in the city of [[Imbrue]].",
        "Usage": "The spell was available to [[cleric]]s of [[Karsus]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/104/Forgotten Deities: Karsus|4}}"
