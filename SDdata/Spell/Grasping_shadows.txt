Grasping shadows was an illusion spell learned by newly trained wizards, particularly illusionists. With grasping shadows, a wizard was able to command shadows to reach out and ensnare nearby foes. These affected an area of roughly  in diameter, within  of the wizard. Creatures caught in the shadows suffer mental injury and are slowed down for a brief while. The spell lasted only a short time.
