        "mainbody": "'''''Rock catch''''' was a [[transmutation]] spell that allowed a target, chosen by the spellcaster, to do exactly what it's name would imply: catch rocks. Specifically, this spell allowed someone to catch rocks, and other such projectiles such as the ammunition of a catapult or ''[[stone trap]]'', up to 16 sq. or 64 cu. ft. The catch of these boulders would then must put them down immediately, as there were no specifications in the spell about ''holding'' these caught rocks.",
