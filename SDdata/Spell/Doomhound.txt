'''''Doomhound''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Urogalan]].
 
==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a [[mastiff]] of shadow that was only visible to the caster and a targeted creature. When the targeted creature first saw the ''doomhound'', they were overcome with ''[[fear]]''. The ''doomhound'' slowly stalked the targeted creature but always remained {{SI|100|yd|long=yes}} from them. This created an extreme sense of dread and doom in the targeted creature. This spell had no effect on creatures with a natural or magical immunity to ''fear''. The caster could only send a single ''doomhound'' at a time. The ''doomhound'' was immune to both magical and physical attacks. The spell persisted until the death of the targeted creature or if either a ''[[limited wish]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'', or ''[[wish]]'' spell were cast on the affected individual.
 
==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Urogalan.
