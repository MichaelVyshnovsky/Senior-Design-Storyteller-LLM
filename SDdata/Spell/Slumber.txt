Slumber was a rare spell of the southern magic tradition.
The spell caused one or more creatures within 60 yards (54 meters) from the caster to fall into a deep, comatose sleep. All creatures needed to be within 50 feet (15 meters) of each other. The number of creatures affected was dependant on the casters skill level. Weaker creatures were more susceptible to the spell than stronger creatures.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a pinch of dust.
