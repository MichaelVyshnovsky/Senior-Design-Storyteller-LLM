Wall of pain was a spell that filled a space, at least 10 sq. ft in area, with a horrid, pain-inducing energy. The pain felt by those who passed through the wall was so severe that it hampered their abilities to fight, defend themselves and otherwise take action.
The material component for this spell was a miniature scourge.
