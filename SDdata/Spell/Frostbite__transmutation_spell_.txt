Frostbite was a spell which allowed druids to inflict an intense cold on a foe, causing injuries and damaging the affected body tissues.
This spell could be cast on one creature within , but more experience casters could extend this range. In an instant, the victim was subjected to extreme cold, causing frostbite, a numbing of the extremities, and the symptoms of hypothermia, leaving the target with debilitating fatigue as if they had suffered long exposure to frigid temperatures.
It was possible for a tough enough creature to resist the effects of this spell, and appropriately warm clothing could also help offset its effects.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
Frostbite was one of four original spells created by the Chauntean druid Bryn Kernwyld, and published in the book Earthmothers Weapons. While the precise creation date of the spell was unknown, sages agreed that it was likely anterior to 1000 DR. The spell was devised by Byrn to help her brethren during the wars which opposed the forces of Malar and Bhaal and the civilized people of the Moonshae Isles. It proved a great help to minimize the damage wars caused to the surrounding nature.
After its creation, knowledge of this spell was passed down between druids by oral tradition, while the actual tome was kept safe by senior members of their order.
Long after its creation, Bryns book found itself in the hands of a Malarite druid going by the name of Galast. Ignoring the origin of the book, Galast learnt and used the spells described therein. His deity, considering the spells useful, granted him access to these spells.
