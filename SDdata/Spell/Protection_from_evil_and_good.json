        "mainbody": "'''''Protection from evil and good''''', also called '''''protection from alignment''''', was a defensive [[spell]] that protected a caster from either evil or good alignment.",
        "Effects": "This spell was cast on a willing individual. During casting, the caster selected which alignment to defend against. When cast, this spell protected an area around a targeted creature. Within this area, immunity was granted against mind-affecting effects or spells used by the selected alignment. The spell also provided minimal protection against physical attacks from creatures of the selected alignment, such as [[celestial]]s (good) or [[fiend]]s (evil). The spell made it more difficult for such creatures to attack the individual. It also prevented the individual from being charmed or possessed.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: either [[holy water]] or a blend of powdered [[iron]] and [[silver]]. The spell consumed these materials during casting."
