        "mainbody": "Know protections was a basic spell used by bards, sorcerers and wizards.\nThis spell allowed a caster to ascertain the defenses and protections of a targeted creature. The spell revealed if the creature had any immunity or resistance to damage, spells or energy. The targeted creature had to be within  of the caster for the spell to function properly. This distance increased as the casters skill level grew.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components.\nThis spell was commonly used by the Church of the Red Knight and was described in the reference and spell book Master Tactician."
