        "Effects": "This spell converted every spell memorized by a [[wizard]] into pure magical energy, allowing for an extremely deadly strike to every creature standing with 30 ft (10 m) of the caster.\n\nThis spell even affected creatures with magical resistance, but with less power.\n\nThe caster risked their life when casting this spell. If they were able to resist the deadly magic, then the caster was permanently weakened, often falling into a prolonged coma for several weeks.",
        "Components": "This spell required a finger bone of an archmage to cast. Before casting, the finger bone needed to be prepared using a special ritual that lasted several days.\n\nMaterials needed for the ritual included:\n* [[diamond]] dust worth at least 5,000 [[gp]]\n* [[platinum]] ring",
        "History": "This spell was rumored to by used by [[Mycontil]] himself during his final stand against the [[Dambrath|Dambraii]] invaders,"
