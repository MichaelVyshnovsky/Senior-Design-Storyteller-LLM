        "mainbody": "Ice axe was a divine magic spell available to clerics of Auril, the Frostmaiden. It created a whirling cloud of ice slivers shaped like a battleaxe that the caster could wield with proficiency.\nWhen cast, this spell produced a magical battleaxe made from swirling slivers of ice that appeared in the casters hand. For the next five minutes (longer for more experienced casters) it could be wielded as if the caster were proficient with this type of weapon. The strength of the caster was not important because the ice axe was magical and nearly weightless. On a successful hit, the ice axe did both slashing damage as per a battleaxe, and potentially greater damage by magical coldness.\nWhile the caster held the ice axe, he or she could not be disarmed of the weapon and it could not be physically damaged. If the caster used the axe hand for some other purpose, like holding another object or grappling with an opponent, the ice axe disappeared until the hand was empty and ready to wield it again. This spell lasted until dismissed by the caster or the duration expired, whichever came first.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a shard of ice, glass, or crystal to cast.\nThis spell was believed to be recorded in a holy book of Auril called Revelations of the Icedawn and was only granted to her clerical followers."
