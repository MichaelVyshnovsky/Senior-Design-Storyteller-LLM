        "mainbody": "Power word, distract, was a spell from the enchantment school that could be wielded by both sorcerers and wizards.\nAfter the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, the spell was able to briefly distract a creature. The distraction was great enough that it heavily hampered the targets ability to defend itself.\nThe spell only worked on creatures under a certain high degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the spellcaster.\nThe spell required only a verbal component, which was the uttering of the power word itself.\nThe spell could be wielded by both sorcerers and wizards."
