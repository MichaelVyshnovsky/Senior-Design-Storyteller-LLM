'''''Reed staff''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] given to [[priest]]s of [[Sheela Peryroyl]], the Green Sister, and [[Yondalla]], the Nurturing Matriarch. It temporarily turned a blade of grass into a [[quarterstaff]].

==Effects==
This spell turned an ordinary blade of grass into a [[:Category:Magic weapons|magical]] ''+0 quarterstaff'' that only the caster could use. If another being took possession or attempted to use it, the weapon was dispelled. Likewise, the ''reed staff'' could be destroyed by a successful ''[[dispel magic]]'' cast upon it, or touching an ''[[anti-magic shell]]'' or similar effect inimical to [[magic]]. The spell lasted for a minimum of four minutes (longer for more experienced casters) and the caster was not required to remain in contact with the quarterstaff once it had been created.

==Components==
This spell required a [[Verbal component|verbal]] command, the priest's [[holy symbol]], a sliver of wood, and a blade of grass.
