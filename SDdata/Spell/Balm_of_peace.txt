'''''Balm of peace''''' was a ''channel divinity'' power granted to [[cleric]]s who chose the [[Peace domain]].

==Effects==
When a cleric of the peace domain channeled divinity whilst retreating, they could move out of the way of attacks without getting hit. If the caster was to move within {{SI|5|ft}} another creature, the creature would be soothed with a healing balm. The wiser the cleric became, the more the creature would be healed.
