Undead torch was an evocation/necromancy spell that set a corporeal undead creature ablaze with a chilly flame that damaged living beings.
Upon casting this spell, the targeted creature was engulfed in fire that damaged live creatures, but caused them no harm. The blue flames had a similar appearance to the "chill" effect created by a fire shield spell.
This spell had no effects on non-corporeal undead. Any affected corporeal undead creatures immediately nullified the effects of undead torch if they became non-corporeal.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the material component of a live or preserved firefly or glow worm.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
