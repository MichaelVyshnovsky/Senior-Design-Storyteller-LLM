'''''Undead torch''''' was an [[evocation]]/[[necromancy]] [[spell]] that set a corporeal [[undead]] creature ablaze with a chilly flame that damaged living beings.

==Effects==
Upon casting this spell, the targeted creature was engulfed in fire that damaged live creatures, but caused them no harm. The blue flames had a similar appearance to the "chill" effect created by a ''[[fire shield]]'' spell.

This spell had no effects on non-corporeal undead. Any affected corporeal undead creatures immediately nullified the effects of ''undead torch'' if they became non-corporeal.

==Casting==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the [[material component]] of a live or preserved [[firefly]] or [[glow worm]].
==History==
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
