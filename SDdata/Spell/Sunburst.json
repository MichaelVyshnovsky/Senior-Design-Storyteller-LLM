        "mainbody": "'''''Sunburst''''' was an [[arcane]] [[evocation]] and [[Divine magic|divine]] spell that blinded and damaged nearby enemies.",
        "Effects": "There were a few different versions of this spell that developed over time. The earliest version was centered on the caster, and indeed the radiance was emitted from the caster's person out to a minimum radius of 160 ft (49 m); even farther for more experienced casters. Later versions could be cast at a point far away and burst with a fixed size. The pre-[[Spellplague]] version had a range of at least 1,000 ft (305 m) and an 80 ft (24 m) radius of effect. The post-[[Second Sundering]] version could only be cast out to 150 ft (46 m) and burst in a 60 ft (18 m) radius.\n\n''Sunburst'' caused a globe of searing heat and radiance to explode instantly and silently from the caster or the targeted point. All creatures in the globe had a chance to be blinded and damaged by the heat. Creatures that could see in darkness, or to whom sunlight was harmful (such as [[vampire]]s) or unnatural (such as [[drow]]) were affected more severely. [[Undead]] creatures caught within the globe also suffered greater effects, sometimes resulting in the complete destruction of undead creatures susceptible to sunlight. The ultraviolet light generated by the spell also damaged [[Fungus|fungi]], mold, [[ooze]]s, [[slime]]s, jellies, puddings, and fungoid creatures just as if they were undead creatures.\n\nThe later versions of this spell also dispelled any magical ''[[darkness]]'' within the area of effect.",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a piece of [[Sunstone (gem)|sunstone]] and an open, unshielded flame to cast.",
        "History": "This spell appeared in a diary by an unknown mage believed to have lived in the mid-[[:Category:13th century|13th century]] [[DR]]. The book was given the name ''[[Against the Undead]]'' by one of its readers. Sometime after it was discovered it was published in ''[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]'' and became generally known, but it was uncommon to find it."
