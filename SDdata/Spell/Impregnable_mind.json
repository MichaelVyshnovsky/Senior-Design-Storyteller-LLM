        "mainbody": "'''''Impregnable mind''''' was an [[enchantment]] spell that greatly improved the recipient's chances of resisting magical or [[psionic]] attacks on the mind.",
        "Effects": "For ten minutes, more depending on the level of the caster, the recipient of this spell was much less likely to be ''[[beguile]]d'', ''[[Charm Person|charmed]]'', ''[[Dominate person|dominated]]'', ''[[feeblemind]]ed'', ''[[Hold person|held]]'' or succumb to similar mind-affecting spells and psionics. Even when the odds were hopeless, this spell gave a chance to resist supposedly non-resistible assaults on the mind. Note that magical and psionic attacks that attack the body (such as telekinesis) were not prevented by this spell.",
