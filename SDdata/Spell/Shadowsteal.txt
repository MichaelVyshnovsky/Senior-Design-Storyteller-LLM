'''''Shadowsteal''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the schools of [[alteration]] and [[illusion]].

==Effects==
This spell could be triggered at the time of casting or long after by either uttering a command word or the fulfillment of specific conditions set at the time of casting. It affected the caster or a willing recipient touched by the caster.

When under the influence of a ''shadowsteal'' the recipient acquired a shapeshifting shadowy appearance that utterly concealed their identity. They retained all of their normal skills and abilities. The continually shifting appearance also emitted changing signatures of heat that confounded [[infravision]].

The target could open a ''[[dimension door]]'' at any time while the spell was active, but doing so instantly ended the spell. A ''shadowsteal'' could be negated only by a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell or the death of the spell's target.''<nowiki/>''

==Components==
This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.

==History==
In ages past this spell was a preferred method of wizards to kill a foe and escape without getting caught.
