Protection from water was an abjuration spell that created a magical, impermeable sphere that followed the caster for a set duration of time.
The sphere encompassed the caster 5" (12.7 centimeters) outward from their person and was completely impenetrable by any solid, gas, or liquid, including water. If the caster were to step into a body of water they would seem to walk on its surface. They felt no lack of mobility when walking upon any icy surface. The sphere lasted anywhere from 5 to 8 minutes.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a handful of dry sand taken from a desert.
Protection from water was employed by the Red Wizards of Thay, and presumed lost after the Time of Troubles.
