Detect thoughts, also known as ESP,
The caster was able to sense the surface thoughts of beings within range. How long they examined an area or subjected decided what kind of information was received. It could penetrate barriers, but  of stone,  of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or  of wood or dirt blocked it.
The post–Second Sundering version of the spell also allowed the caster to detect the surface thoughts of a creature and "detect" where they were. This spell could be used for interrogation and also to probe deeper into the targets mind. The spell could not detect or read the mind of very unintelligent creatures or creatures that did not speak any language. The spell reached 30 feet, and lasted 1 minute but could not penetrate  of wood or dirt,  of stone,  of regular metals, or a thin layer of lead.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was a copper piece.
Witchs ESP a variant restricted to witches, this required the caster to maintain physical contact with their target and instead of a copper piece it used a pinch of powdered nightshade as a material component.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Zahn in  and was originally called Zahns ESP.
