        "mainbody": "Into the Void by Nigel Findley is book two in the Cloakmaster Cycle, a six-book series for the Spelljammer campaign setting. It is set in the Forgotten Realms.\nTeldin Moore, a farmer from Krynn, leaves his home world behind as a passenger aboard a gnomish sidewheeler, the Unquenchable. As he watches his planet grow farther and farther away, a gnome named Horvath teaches him about crystal spheres.\nHorvath invites Teldin to join him and three other gnomes on a smaller craft to examine the extent of damage taken to the gnomish spelljammer in a previous battle. Shortly thereafter, the Unquenchable pulls away from them, and they see that it has fallen under attack from space pirates.\nAfter being helped aboard by the first mate Aelfred Silverhorn, Teldin is surprised to learn that the captain of the Probe is an illithid named Estriss, despite most of the rest of the crew being human. Estriss claims to be an historian and philosopher and welcomes Teldin and the four gnomes aboard.\nAs they travel, they encounter a void scavver, and Teldins cloak helps him save the navigator Sylvies life.\nShortly after their conversation, the Probe reaches the very end of Krynnspace. They create a portal and enter the \"flow\".\nThe conversation is interrupted by the spotting of a neogi deathspider. but the Probe ultimately escapes and continues on toward Realmspace. During the battle, Teldins magic cloak had protected him with unexplained shielding powers, and Aelfred and Estriss discuss with him the likelihood that the neogi were after his cloak and were somehow able to track it from afar.\nAfter the battle, Teldin sleeps for nearly 24 hours. Afterward, he has a discussion about his cloaks powers with Estriss, and the two of them discover that Teldin can use the cloak to change his own appearance.\n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •   •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  • \n  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  •  • \n  •  •  •  •  • \n* On pages 75 and 76, the novel describes Teldin stepping down the three steps from the upper bridge of the Probe onto its forward weapon deck to find Shandess there with his back against the ballista mount. However, the forward weapon deck of a hammership is where the forward-mounted catapult is located, which is clear both from other places in the novel and from sourcebooks detailing the standard layout of hammerships."
