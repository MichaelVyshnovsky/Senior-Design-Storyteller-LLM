'''''Remorse''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
A shugenja used this spell to deliver a scathing condemnation of a creature's evil deeds. The creature was wracked with guilt and regret as a result. The spell was only effective on sentient creatures who spoke the same language as the shugenja. During casting, the shugenja suggested appropriate restitution. Similar to the ''[[oath]]'' spell, the creature swears to refrain from committing evil deeds, and if they break this vow, they suffer terribly painful spasms across their body. The ''[[atonement]]'' spell removed the obligations of ''remorse'' from a creature.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s, a [[pearl]], which was given to the target creature, and the holy symbol of the shugenja.
