Remorse was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
A shugenja used this spell to deliver a scathing condemnation of a creatures evil deeds. The creature was wracked with guilt and regret as a result. The spell was only effective on sentient creatures who spoke the same language as the shugenja. During casting, the shugenja suggested appropriate restitution. Similar to the oath spell, the creature swears to refrain from committing evil deeds, and if they break this vow, they suffer terribly painful spasms across their body. The atonement spell removed the obligations of remorse from a creature.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a pearl, which was given to the target creature, and the holy symbol of the shugenja.
