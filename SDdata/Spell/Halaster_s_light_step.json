        "mainbody": "Halasters light step was a transmutation spell that functioned similarly to fly, except the caster traveled a speed of 5 (1.5 m) per second, or 3.3 (1 m) if they wore heavier armor. In addition, they could not ascend vertically while over semi-flat terrain except within 1 (0.3 m) of the ground.\nThis spell was developed by the powerful archmage of the Undermountain, Halaster Blackcloak.\nIn effect, Halasters light step allowed the caster to walk across level terrain without stepping on the ground and leaving tracks, as well as traversing wide crevasses. When used alongside levitate, the combined effect functioned as a slower-moving version of the spell fly."
