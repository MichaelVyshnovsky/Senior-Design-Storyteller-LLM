        "mainbody": "'''''Halaster's light step''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that functioned similarly to ''[[fly]]'', except the caster traveled a speed of 5' (1.5 m) per second, or 3.3' (1 m) if they wore heavier [[armor]]. In addition, they could not ascend vertically while over semi-flat terrain except within 1' (0.3 m) of the ground.\n\nThis spell was developed by the powerful [[archmage]] of the [[Undermountain]], [[Halaster Blackcloak]].",
        "Uses": "In effect, ''Halaster's light step'' allowed the caster to walk across level terrain without stepping on the ground and leaving tracks, as well as traversing wide crevasses. When used alongside ''[[levitate]]'', the combined effect functioned as a slower-moving version of the spell ''fly''."
