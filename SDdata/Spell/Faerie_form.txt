Faerie form was a spell known to specialty priests of Erevan Ilesere.
The spell functioned similarly to shapechange, but only allowed the caster to assume the form of different kinds of fey, such as a brownie, atomie, bramble, dobie, faerie fiddler, gorse, grig, killmoulis, nixie, pixie, quickling, sea sprite, or sprite. The caster adopted the abilities of that form except for innate magical abilities, magical resistances, and abilities based on intellect.
Additionally, the caster could change between faerie forms as long as the spell lasted, which could be up to a number of hours according to the casters power. Each change in form only took a second.
This spell required verbal, somatic, and material components, the last in the form of locks of hair from three different types of sprite.
