        "mainbody": "'''''Bigby's grasping hand''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a hand of force to grapple with an opponent. [[Cleric]]s who cast this spell named it for their deity&mdash;''[[Lathander]]'s grasping hand'', for example. To [[Zakhara]]n mages, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''grasping hand''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].",
        "Effects": "This spell was one of the ''[[Bigby's hand]]'' family of spells. It created a hand about the size of an [[ogre]]) that could be used to grab and hold a creature.  All versions of this spell relied on the caster's senses to detect and locate a target, the fist did not have senses of its own. But once a target was designated, the ''hand'' would unerringly stick with the target regardless of invisibility, polymorphing, darkness, or other means of concealment or disguise.\n\nThe earliest versions never missed the target once it was designated, but later versions performed repeated melee attacks until the grapple succeeded or until the spell expired. A successful grab immobilized the target. The ''grasping hand'' could also be used in the same manner as ''[[Bigby's interposing hand]]'' or as an improved ''[[Bigby's forceful hand]]'' with greater strength. For the earlier versions, the weight of the target determined the reduction in movement rate. A 1,000 lb (455 kg) creature could be held motionless, while a 16,000 lb (7,270 kg) creature would be slowed to half its normal movement speed.\n\nRange and duration varied widely over the history of this spell. For the earliest versions, a wizard that had advanced just enough to cast this spell could control the ''hand'' for 14 minutes and extend its reach to 140 ft (43 m) indoors/140 yd (128 m) outdoors. Later versions lasted only a minute or two, but the reach was extended from 120 ft (36.6 m) to 230 ft (70.1 m) at a minimum.\n\nFor all versions of this spell, the health of the ''hand'' was the same as the caster's uninjured health.\n\nWhen cast on [[Avernus]], the first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], a [[fiend]]ish claw appeared instead of a hand.",
        "Components": "In addition to the verbal component, all versions required somatic gestures. After the [[Second Sundering]], the ''hand'' imitated the movement of the caster's hand for the duration of the spell. The early versions required a glove made of leather, but after the Second Sundering, the material components were refined to an [[egg]]shell and a glove made of snakeskin."
