'''''Proctiv's move mountain''''' was a legendary [[Netherese]] spell that sheared off a mountaintop, allowing the creation of the famous [[Netherese enclave]]s.

==Effects==
The spell was extremely direct in its applications. With the [[arcanist]]'s guidance, it severed the section of mountain desired, rotated it so that the flat side faced upward, and maintained a ''[[levitation]]'' effect that kept it aloft until more permanent arrangements could be made.

==Components==
The material components for this spell were a ''[[mythallar]]'' (which needed to be placed in the new city within two weeks), a magical device that allowed flying or levitation, and a [[crystal ball]].

==History==
The spell was created by the arcanist [[Proctiv]] in {{yearlinkConvert|1746|NY}}, and without it the construction of [[Netheril]]'s flying enclaves would have been near-impossible. As an [[epic magic|epic spell]], it could no longer be cast due to the restrictions placed on magic by [[Mystra]] after [[Karsus's Folly]] in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}.<ref> Later ages remembered the spell simply as '''''move mountain'''''.
