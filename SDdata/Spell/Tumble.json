        "mainbody": "Tumble was an uncommon spell of the southern magic tradition.\nThe spell targeted a single creature and caused them to trip and fall to the ground. The target would continuously trip and tumble until the spell expired. The target creature was unable to attack nor cast a spell during this time.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, grease, which was consumed during the casting of the spell."
