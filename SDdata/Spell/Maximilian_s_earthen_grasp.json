        "mainbody": "'''''Maximilian's earthen grasp''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that caused the [[Earth (element)|earth]] itself to grab and restrain a target.",
        "Effects": "The spell caused a [[human]]-sized hand made of compacted earth to appear within a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} from the caster. It then grabbed a specified target creature, restraining and crushing it. The hand could be directed to move to a new target within range and lasted for up to one minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating on the spell.\n\nThe spell did not work in [[wildspace]] or in the [[phlogiston]], since there was no earth from which the hand could emerge.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was a miniature hand sculpted in [[clay]],",
