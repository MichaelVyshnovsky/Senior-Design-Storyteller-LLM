        "mainbody": "Maximilians earthen grasp was a transmutation spell that caused the earth itself to grab and restrain a target.\nThe spell caused a human-sized hand made of compacted earth to appear within a range of  from the caster. It then grabbed a specified target creature, restraining and crushing it. The hand could be directed to move to a new target within range and lasted for up to one minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating on the spell.\nThe spell did not work in wildspace or in the phlogiston, since there was no earth from which the hand could emerge.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was a miniature hand sculpted in clay,\n* The great ghul sorcerer Dahshur utilized a self-modified version of earthen grasp that they referred to as Dahshurs sandy grasp."
