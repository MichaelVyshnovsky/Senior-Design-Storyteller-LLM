'''''Candletrick''''' was a common spell used by [[wu jen]] and [[geisha]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
The spell was cast on a small fire used as a light source. After the spell was cast, the flame could not be extinguished by any normal means. If the spell was cast on a candle, and it was snuffed, the flame would immediately relight. If the candle was snuffed underwater or in a strong wind or spell such as ''[[gust of wind]]'', the flame would not relight. If the oxygen supply of the flame was removed, the flame would extinguish. The spell only worked on small flames, it could not be used on larger flames such as a campfire.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
