'''''Greater heroism''''' or '''''superheroism''''' was an [[enchantment]] or [[alteration]] [[spell]] that made the target fight at a level worthy of legends.

==Effects==
For the latter, [[enchantment]]-based version, the target became braver. The target gained a complete immunity against fear and became better at fighting, at resisting physical attacks and other effects, and at doing generally everything.

Earlier versions instead operated only on the martially-minded, and only by enhancing their life force. As a result, they fought at a superb, heroic level, and gained phenomenal staying power. However, for those whose prowess was already worthy of legend, the spell did nothing.

==Components==
The spell only required somatic and verbal components. While early clerical versions called for a holy symbol, the wizardly versions called instead for a [[treant]]'s leaf.

==History==
The spell was very rare and guarded jealously by its [[grey elf]] creators by the year {{yearlink|1367}}.
