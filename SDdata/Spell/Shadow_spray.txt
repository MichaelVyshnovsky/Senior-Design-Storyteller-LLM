'''''Shadow spray''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a directed explosion of a large number of shadow ribbons. The burst radius was {{SI|5|ft}}. Any creature with the blast radius suffered damage. They were also dazed and became more vulnerable to fear-based spells.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a small amount of black ribbons.

==History==
This spell was included in the ''[[Rudiments of the Shadow Weave]]'', a controversial book about [[Shar]]ran doctrine and the [[Shadow Weave]], written by the [[wizard]] [[Vontallion Rose]].
