Foresight was a divine divination spell used by specialty priests devoted to Savras called Sibylites, enabling them to see the immediate future.
This spell allowed the caster to glimpse several minutes ahead into the future of a single target. In order for the spell to work the caster needed to be able to see the target or read their mind. It was impossible for the target to surprise the caster while this spell was active. Revealing the targets future actions to the target did not guarantee that those actions would occur.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol, a small silver hourglass filled with fine white sand worth at least 50 gp, and a small piece of amber to cast.
