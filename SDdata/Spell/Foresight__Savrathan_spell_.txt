'''''Foresight''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[divination]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Savras]] called [[Sibylite]]s, enabling them to see the immediate future.

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to glimpse several minutes ahead into the future of a single target. In order for the spell to work the caster needed to be able to see the target or read their mind. It was impossible for the target to surprise the caster while this spell was active. Revealing the target's future actions to the target did not guarantee that those actions would occur.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]], a small [[silver]] [[hourglass]] filled with fine white [[sand]] worth at least 50 [[gp]], and a small piece of [[amber]] to cast.
