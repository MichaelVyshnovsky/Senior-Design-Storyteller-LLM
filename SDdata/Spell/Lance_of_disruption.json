        "mainbody": "Lance of disruption was an arcane evocation spell that produced a damaging lance and could blast wood and stonework apart.\nThe disruptive lance, which was  long and  wide, damaged all creatures caught within. The damage scaled with the power of the caster. Some creatures were able to resist, and if so, were only subject to half the damage. However, amorphous beings, like oozes, were resistant to the lances power.\nInanimate objects, such as walls, ornaments, and furniture, could be blasted apart by the power of the lance. More sturdy objects would be severely damaged.\nThis uncommon spell only required verbal and somatic components."
