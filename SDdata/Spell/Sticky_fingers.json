        "mainbody": "Sticky fingers was a spell that made the caster better at pilfering things using sleights of hand.\nOn casting sticky fingers, the casters fingers secreted a sticky substance while the hands became more agile. The effect lasted for at least ten minutes (longer for more experienced casters) and could be dispelled at will.\nOne version of this spell required both verbal and somatic components."
