'''''Metamorphose liquids''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
This spell transformed one liquid into and equal amount of any other non-magical liquid. The spell would not take effect unless the caster touched the actual liquid. It was more difficult to transform magical liquids into non-magical liquids. Magical fluids could not be transformed into different kids of magical fluids.

This spell could be used to harm creatures native to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a drop of the liquid that the caster intended to create to cast. The drop needed to be placed on the caster's tongue and consumed.

==Notable Users==
* [[Mijel Morigan]], a wizard who operated [[Morrigan's Complete Components]] in [[Ravens Bluff]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/75/The Living City: Eye Of Newt and Food For Familiars|7}}
