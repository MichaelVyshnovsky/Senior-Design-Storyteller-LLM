Weavesong was a powerful divine invocation spell from the creation sphere that allowed the caster to call upon the Weave to create nonliving matter.
Nearly any object of any size could be created given enough time. However, the casting time of the spell was ten minutes per pound of organic matter created, one hour per pound of earth or stone, and one day per pound of gemstone created, so practical limits did apply. Once created, the item was immune to dispel magic, Mordenkainens disjunction, and similar spells. Weavesong was a physically demanding spell to cast, leaving the caster temporarily drained of vitality based upon how long the spell took to cast. Matter created via weavesong was permanent provided the spell succeeded. Failed castings stood a small chance of releasing a backlash of harmful pure magical energy.
Weavesong could be cast cooperatively, increasing the amount of matter that could be created.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the casters holy symbol and a small amount of the material to be created to cast.
Weavesong was an incredibly rare spell on Toril.
