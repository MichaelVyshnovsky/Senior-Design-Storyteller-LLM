Control giant insect was a very rare spell that was used by clerics of Lathander.
When cast, this spell allowed the caster to control any giant insect. It functioned on a single natural giant insect or an insect that has been magically enlarged. Since caster was required to control the targeted insect from a distance, this prevented the caster from using this spell to employ a giant insect as a mount. The caster was able to perform complex tasks remotely via the enchanted insect.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component a piece of the same species of the targeted insect. For example, a giant spider could be enchanted with this spell by using a leg from a regular spider.
This spell was developed from the control aratha spell, which was uniquely used by the clerics of the Dawnspire, a temple of Lathander in Myth Drannor, to control arathas.
