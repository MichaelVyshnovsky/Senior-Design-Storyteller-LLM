'''''Minor image''''', also known as '''''improved phantasmal force''''' was an [[illusion]] spell of the [[figment]] subschool that created a simple illusory image accompanied by sound. It was typically an [[arcane magic|arcane]] spell but was also available to [[cleric]]s of deities with power over [[Creation domain|creation]], [[Gnome domain|gnomes]], or [[illusion domain|illusion]].

==Effects==
The effects of this spell were similar to those of ''[[silent image]]'', except that the figment also included sounds. The sounds, however, could not include understandable speech. The effects would last for as long as the spellkeeper concentrated on maintaining them and then faded a short time after that.

The sound from this spell could not be heard in the void of [[wildspace]], since no sound could be heard in a vacuum; however, nothing prevented a caster from creating the illusion within a distant [[air envelope]] within the range of the spell.

==Components==
Like several other illusionary spells, this one required a tiny amount of [[sheep|wool]] as a [[spell focus]], in addition to [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s.

==History==
In [[Faer√ªn]], the spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Carbury]] in {{Yearlink|-847}}.

==Known Users==
* [[Heino]], a [[gnome]] companion of [[Marcus Wands]], was known to use this spell.
