Minor image, also known as improved phantasmal force was an illusion spell of the figment subschool that created a simple illusory image accompanied by sound. It was typically an arcane spell but was also available to clerics of deities with power over creation, gnomes, or illusion.
The effects of this spell were similar to those of silent image, except that the figment also included sounds. The sounds, however, could not include understandable speech. The effects would last for as long as the spellkeeper concentrated on maintaining them and then faded a short time after that.
The sound from this spell could not be heard in the void of wildspace, since no sound could be heard in a vacuum however, nothing prevented a caster from creating the illusion within a distant air envelope within the range of the spell.
Like several other illusionary spells, this one required a tiny amount of wool as a spell focus, in addition to somatic and verbal components.
In Faer√ªn, the spell was invented by the Netherese arcanist Carbury in .
* Heino, a gnome companion of Marcus Wands, was known to use this spell.
