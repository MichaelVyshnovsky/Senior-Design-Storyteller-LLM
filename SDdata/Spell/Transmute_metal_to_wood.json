        "mainbody": "'''''Transmute metal to wood''''' was a [[transmutation]] spell that permanently transformed any metal within a 40 foot (12 m) radius into wood. Older versions of this spell only operated on a single object.",
        "Effects": "All objects made of metal were affected. Magical items had a chance to resist being transformed. Wooden weapons and armor were less effective and had a chance to splinter and break. The effect was permanent unless a ''[[limited wish]]'' or the equivalent was used to transform items back to their original state. When this spell was used only on a single object, it took a full ''[[wish]]'' to return it to metallic form again.",
        "Components": "Verbal and somatic components, as well as the caster's holy symbol or [[divine focus]] were required to cast this spell.",
