        "mainbody": "Transmute metal to wood was a transmutation spell that permanently transformed any metal within a 40 foot (12 m) radius into wood. Older versions of this spell only operated on a single object.\nAll objects made of metal were affected. Magical items had a chance to resist being transformed. Wooden weapons and armor were less effective and had a chance to splinter and break. The effect was permanent unless a limited wish or the equivalent was used to transform items back to their original state. When this spell was used only on a single object, it took a full wish to return it to metallic form again.\nVerbal and somatic components, as well as the casters holy symbol or divine focus were required to cast this spell.\nCategoryTransmutation spells\nCategoryAlteration spells\nCategoryDruid spells\n35x95mrqxofkz7l72rk8drye42wqkjd"
