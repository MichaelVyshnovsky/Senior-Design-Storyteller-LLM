Additionally, it was able to function alongside [[infravision]], [[ultravision]], and X-ray vision. If this spell was cast with the ''[[detect invisibility]]'' spell, the caster was able to see invisible creatures, as well as astral and ethereal creatures.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a special crystal disk with eight eyes carved into it."
