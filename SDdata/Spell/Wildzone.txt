'''''Wildzone''''' was a [[wild magic]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[wild mage]]s.

==Effects==
This spell appeared to replicate conditions found in wild magic regions by disrupting magical forces. Though the effects of this spell were temporary, casting this spell in conjunction with a ''[[permanency]]'' spell could create a permanent wild magic zone.

The area effected by this spell was a square measuring {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}} long on each side. The square was centered on the caster's position when the spell was cast. Wild magic dominated the ''wildzone'', causing [[wild surge]]s any time a spell was cast or a [[magic item]] discharged. A spell cast outside of the ''wildzone'' would function normally.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required several pots of paint and a hammered sheet of [[silver]] worth at least 2,000 [[gp]] to cast. The paint needed to be poured over the silver sheet during the casting.
