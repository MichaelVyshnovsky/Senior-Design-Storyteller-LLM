Celestial brilliance was an evocation spell that conjured a blaze of celestial light from an object.
The caster touched an object as part of casting this spell. The object began to radiate bright light to a radius of  and dim light to twice that radius. Within the bright spot, it possessed all the effects of natural sunlight and more this light damaged all undead, including those who were not vulnerable to sunlight, and even fiends, against which it dealt double its normal damage. Even those who could weather this damage over the short term would last at most a few minutes- and the spell was almost certain to last a week or more.
The spell called only for verbal and somatic components.
