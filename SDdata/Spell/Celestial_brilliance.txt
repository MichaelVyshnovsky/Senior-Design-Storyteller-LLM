'''''Celestial brilliance''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that conjured a blaze of celestial light from an object.

==Effect==
The caster touched an object as part of casting this spell. The object began to radiate bright light to a radius of {{SI|60|feet}} and dim light to twice that radius. Within the bright spot, it possessed all the effects of natural sunlight and more: this light damaged all undead, including those who were not vulnerable to sunlight, and even fiends, against which it dealt double its normal damage. Even those who could weather this damage over the short term would last at most a few minutes- and the spell was almost certain to last a week or more.

==Components==
The spell called only for [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components.
<!--==History==In {{yearlink|1374}}, while traveling from [[Vaelan]] to [[Huorm]] aboard the ''[[Smoke and Fire]]'', the adventurer [[Ususi Manaallin]] employed a scroll that created a radiance akin to sunlight, close enough to actually afflict the sunlight-sensitive [[shadow eft]] she was fighting, almost certainly ''celestial brilliance''.{{cite book/Darkvision|162}} (actually nevermind, Sunburst's a closer match, with a little imagination.)-->
