'''Oswald's mending''' was a special [[spell]] created by the [[gnome|gnomish]] inventor [[Oswald Fiddlebender]] and his niece, [[Maralie]], sometime before [[1312 DR]].

==Components==
The spell was used to repair Oswald's flying ship magically. Once all components were prepared, and the incantations were voiced, the magics slowly worked, mending the damage over a period of several days. The [[material component]]s included freshly collected [[spidersilk]]; a bottle of ''[[thrym extract]]'' collected from a [[remorhaz]]; a [[belladonna]] plant, which turned into a paste when exposed to ''thrym''; some [[iron]] [[ore]], usually substituted by an iron weapon; two [[diamond]]s; and several planks of wood.

==History==
The eccentric and bumbling [[potion]] maker and inventor Oswald Fiddlebender collected and developed numerous spells that he kept in a number of loosely bound messy books. This particular spell found use after Fiddlebender's flying vessel was brought down by a band of [[druid]]s allied with the deadly [[Legion of the Chimera]] that menaced the region. The gnome transported a band of mercenary heroes of [[Targos]], and as everyone survived the crash, Oswald tasked them with collecting all the required components. The search brought the heroes into a head-on confrontation with cultists of [[Auril]] that had erected their ice palace nearby. When the items were collected and spell cast, Oswald sent heroes to travel to [[Kuldahar]] on foot through wind-swept tundra as the ''mending'' was taking too long.
