Frostbite was a divine magic spell available to priests of Auril, the Frostmaiden. It inflicted bone-chilling cold on one creature, causing freezing damage and fatigue from hypothermia.
This spell could be cast on one creature within . More experience casters could extend this range and cause more harm to the target. In an instant, the victim was subjected to extreme cold, causing frostbite, a numbing of the extremities, and the symptoms of hypothermia, leaving the target with debilitating fatigue as if they had suffered long exposure to frigid temperatures. The damage was unavoidable unless the entire spell was avoided or resisted, but with sufficient fortitude the victim could shake off the aftereffect of fatigue.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
This spell was believed to be recorded in a holy book of Auril called Revelations of the Icedawn and was only granted to her clerical and druidic followers.
