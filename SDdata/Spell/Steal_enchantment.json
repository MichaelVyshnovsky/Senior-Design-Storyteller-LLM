        "mainbody": "'''''Steal enchantment''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "With this spell a wizard could literally steal the enchantment from a [[magic item]] and permanently place it within a different nonmagical item. Both items needed to be touched by the caster during the casting, and the items needed to be the same type. With regards to weapons, the transference could only occur between a bladed weapon and another bladed weapon, or a blunt weapon to another blunt weapon, etc. A nonmagical item could only hold the enchantment of a single magic item using this spell. The new magic item exactly duplicated the effects of the host item, including having the same number of charges if applicable.\n\nThe stolen enchantment was at a risk of being lost depending on the expertise of the caster.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a target nonmagical item to cast. The target item needed to be of equal or greater value than the object that was to be drained.",
        "History": "''Steal enchantment'' was a spell in the so-called \"school of incantation\" that [[incantatrix]]es used.{{Cite polyhedron/117/The Incantatrix|6}} It was known to [[Sammaster]] during the start of the span of time in which he was a [[Chosen of Mystra]], circa {{yearlink|850}}."
