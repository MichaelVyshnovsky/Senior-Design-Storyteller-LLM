        "mainbody": "Bane of Beshaba, also called Beshabas arsekick, was a divine spell used by priests devoted to Beshaba.\nThis spell was similar, with negative impacts, to the Favor of Tymora spell. In fact, both of these spells would cancel each other out if used on the same target.\nThis spell cursed a single target touched by a priest of Beshaba. The curse could not be cancelled by a dispel magic spell or other similar methods. The spell lasted either until its power was exhausted or the target perished. In a sense the spell made it more difficult for the target to resist negative effects from spells and similar situations. The curse weakened with each instance until it expired. A target could only be affected by one casting of this spell at a time.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a piece of broken mirror and the clerics holy symbol to cast."
