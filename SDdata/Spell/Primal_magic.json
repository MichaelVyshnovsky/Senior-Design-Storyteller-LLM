It was considered one of the primordial forces of nature, one that served as a bulwark against influences and threats from other [[planes of existence]].",
        "Nature of Primal Magic": "Nearly all aspects of the natural world were somehow linked to primal magic, including all manner of animals, vegetation, weather patterns, and even individual [[planet]]s. The nature of primal magic was believed to change in form and essence depending on the land and world through which it passed.\n\nPrimal magic was considered 'untamed' and even alien by denizens of planes beyond the Prime Material, most notably the [[Feywild]]. When primal magic manifested near ''[[fey crossroad]]s'' it became more 'pure' in nature, Paradoxically, some scholars believed that primal magic was the force of the [[multiverse]] that bound the Feywild and the Prime together.\n\nThe power of each individual's [[truename]] originated from the essence of primal magic.",
