Undead lieutenancy was a necromancy spell that allowed the caster to place a role of leadership on one of their undead minions.
Upon casting the spell, the caster bestowed upon one of their controlled risen creatures a sense of authority over lesser undead, who would follow their command. This leader also protected any of these lesser risen creatures from any undead-turning or controlling effects that came from divine spellcasters.
These effects only functioned between undead that had been raised by the same caster. If multiple undead lieutenants of the same caster were in the same area, they formed a hierarchy based on their inherent power. While the spell had a limited duration, it could be dismissed at any time with a mere word from the caster.
The casting of this spell required verbal and somatic components.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
