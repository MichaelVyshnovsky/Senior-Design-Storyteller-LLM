'''''Undead lieutenancy''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to place a role of leadership on one of their [[undead]] minions.

==Effects==
Upon casting the spell, the caster bestowed upon one of their controlled risen creatures a sense of authority over lesser undead, who would follow their command. This leader also protected any of these lesser risen creatures from any undead-[[Turn undead|turning]] or controlling effects that came from [[divine]] spellcasters.

These effects only functioned between undead that had been raised by the same caster. If multiple ''undead lieutenants'' of the same caster were in the same area, they formed a hierarchy based on their inherent power. While the spell had a limited duration, it could be dismissed at any time with a mere word from the caster.

==Casting==
The casting of this spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
==History==
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
