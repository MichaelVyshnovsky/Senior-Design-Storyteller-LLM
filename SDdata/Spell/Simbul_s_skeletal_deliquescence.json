        "mainbody": "The Simbuls skeletal deliquescence was a wizard spell from the school of alteration. This spell was created by the Simbul. It was normally used to punish people, or to disable without killing them.\nThe spell allowed the caster to turn the bones of a touched target into jelly. The spell made the victim collapse into a heap of flesh. They were still able to speak and breathe, but could do little else. They were able to move about slowly on either level planes or downhill.\nVictims of this spell could float on water or swim through it slowly. They could breathe underwater by taking oxygen directly from the water. Liquids, gases and poisons could not harm a boneless victim. They reverted to their normal form when the spell ended.\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast."
