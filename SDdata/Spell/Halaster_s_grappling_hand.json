        "mainbody": "'''''Halaster's grappling hand''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a large non-corporeal hand that accompanied the caster for a short time, protecting them from assailants and certain [[arcane]] [[magic]]. It was developed by the \"Mad Mage\" of the [[Undermountain]], [[Halaster Blackcloak]].",
        "Effects": "The ''grappling hand'' was a 5' (1.5m) tall, incorporeal left hand that was comprised of translucent [[force]] energy. It silently accompanied the caster, within a range of about 10' (3 m), effortlessly passing through walls or other material obstacles. The hand remained with the caster for at least a minute, but stayed longer depending on the skill and experience of the caster.\n\nThe hand only sprang to action when the caster was faced with a threat such as hostile creature, person or if they were the target of specific spells. The hand was designed to identify and stop [[Item enchantment|magical]] [[weapon]]s. If the caster or hand was approached by a person or creature wielding such an item, the ''grappling hand'' reached out for them and attempted to block any attacks with its own form. Additionally, if the spells ''[[magic missile]]'' or ''[[lightning bolt]]'' were directed towards the caster, the hand would similarly place itself in the way of the arcane projectile. The hand could not stop non-magical projectiles or any other spells in this manner.\n\nWhile the hand was not made of material, it was damaged spells it had intercepted and could be harmed by magical weapons, albeit in a limited manner. The damage dealt to the hand depended solely on the enchantment of the weapon or item, i.e. a ''+2 [[dagger]]'' was twice as harmful to a ''grappling hand'' as a ''+1 [[greatsword]]''. The hand could readily be ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'', ''[[cancellation|cancelled]]'' or ''[[negation|negated]]'' by any appropriate magic, but could not be willed away by the caster.",
        "Casting": "This spell only required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast. It required no concentration on behalf of the caster and they were free to perform other actions during the spells duration."
