Enemies abound was a spell that confused an enemy. 
When cast, this spell caused a target creature to become confused and frightened, and subsequently unable to distinguish friend or foe. The creature randomly attacked anyone nearby. A strong-enough creature or a creature with a natural immunity to fear was unaffected by this spell. 
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
