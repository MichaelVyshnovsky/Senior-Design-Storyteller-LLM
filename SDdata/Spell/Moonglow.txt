Moonglow was a wizard spell used to conjure faint light.
This spell created a faint bluish white light resembling the natural light of the moon. The light was centered on an item chosen by the caster. Anything larger than an average human would only be partially illuminated by the spell. The caster needed to see the subject to center the spell upon it.
Though the light created was not bright enough to read small scripts, larger markings were easily discernible.
Contact with any spell that created magical darkness would cancel the spell.
Moonglow only required verbal and somatic components to cast.
The House of the Moon, a temple to Sel√ªne in Waterdeep, had outer walls painted with overlapping moonglow spells to display the faiths teachings.
