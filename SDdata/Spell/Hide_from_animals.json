        "mainbody": "Hide from animals was a spell used by clerics of the hunt domain.\nWhen cast, this spell effectively made the caster, or a targeted creature, invisible to animals. The spell not only hid the recipient from the natural senses of an animal, it also hid them from supernatural senses such as blindsight and tremorsense. The spell ended if the caster or targeted creature made physical contact with an animal.\nIn addition to a somatic component, this spell required a divine focus."
