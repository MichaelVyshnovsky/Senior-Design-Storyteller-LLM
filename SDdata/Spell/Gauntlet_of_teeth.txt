Gauntlet of teeth was a wizard spell from the school of evocation.
This spell created an whirling oval of teeth that hung in midair. The teeth all faced the same direction and followed random paths within an oval measuring  long or tall and  wide. The caster could move the oval around at will and cause it to rotate. The oval of the teeth would remain stationary if the caster began another spell. The teeth could be formed around a target and penetrate openings in barriers the size of the casters head.
The teeth were constructs of force able to penetrate any non-magical armor. They were particularly deadly against living targets but did not harm undead. Targets wearing magical armor were offered slight protection against the teeth.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components at least seven teeth to cast. The teeth were consumed during the casting.
