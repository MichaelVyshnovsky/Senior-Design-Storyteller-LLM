}}'''''Gauntlet of teeth''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the school of [[evocation]].

==Effects==
This spell created an whirling oval of teeth that hung in midair. The teeth all faced the same direction and followed random paths within an oval measuring {{SI|8|ft|long=yes}} long or tall and {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} wide. The caster could move the oval around at will and cause it to rotate. The oval of the teeth would remain stationary if the caster began another spell. The teeth could be formed around a target and penetrate openings in barriers the size of the caster's head.

The teeth were constructs of force able to penetrate any non-magical armor. They were particularly deadly against living targets but did not harm [[undead]]. Targets wearing magical armor were offered slight protection against the teeth.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s at least seven teeth to cast. The teeth were consumed during the casting.
