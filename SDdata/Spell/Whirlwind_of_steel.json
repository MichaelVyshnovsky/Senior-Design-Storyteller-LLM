        "mainbody": "Whirlwind of steel was a divine evocation and conjuration spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Garagos called Bloodreavers.\nThis spell created five phantom arms wielding scimitars that would silently attack targets selected by the caster until dispelled, willed away by the caster, or blocked by magical barriers. The caster decided at the time of casting whether the scimitars would remain in a stationary area or attack a target elsewhere. The caster was not immune to the scimitars attacks so needed to be careful where they wandered. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a piece of a metal-bladed weapon to cast."
