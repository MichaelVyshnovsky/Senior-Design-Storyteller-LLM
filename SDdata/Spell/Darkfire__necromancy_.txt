Darkfire was a divine necromancy spell from the combat and necromantic spheres that shot black flames from the casters eyes and hands.
When the spell was cast, oily black flames erupted from the casters hands. Atypical of normal fire, darkfire was cool to the touch and did not ignite flammable items or objects. It was harmful to living people or creatures and actually healed the undead. With regards to the undead, darkfire could be used to reattach severed body parts by placing them into position and bathing them in the fire.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a pinch of ash that was formed by the cremation of a mammalian creature.
The specifications of darkfire were inscribed within the Beshaban relic, the Black Book.
