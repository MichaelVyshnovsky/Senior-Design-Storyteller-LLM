'''''Touch of death''''' was a ''channel divinity'' power granted to [[cleric]]s who chose the [[Death domain]].

==Effects==
When the cleric attacked a creature with a melee [[weapon]], part of the creature's life force would be destroyed. This attack hurt the struck creature more than a typical melee attack, due to the necrotic energy. The more powerful a caster became, the more life force was destroyed.
