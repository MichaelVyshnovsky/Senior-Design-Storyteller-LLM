Mass polymorph was a transmutation spell that temporarily transformed multiple creatures into beasts.
The spell polymorphed up to ten creatures within a range of  into beasts of the casters choice, melding into the new form all clothes and equipment they were originally carrying. While in beast form, the targets retained their morality and personality, but assumed the mentality and abilities of the beasts they became. This effect lasted for up to 1 hour, as long as the caster kept concentrating.
Unwilling creatures could attempt to resist the spells effects. Unwilling shapechangers were immune to the spell.
If the newly transformed beasts sustained an amount of damage that was sufficient to kill them, they reverted to their original, unaltered forms.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was a caterpillar cocoon.
