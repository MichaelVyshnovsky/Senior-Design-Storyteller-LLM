'''''Mass polymorph''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that temporarily transformed multiple creatures into [[beast]]s.

==Effects==
The spell [[polymorph]]ed up to ten creatures within a range of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} into beasts of the caster's choice, melding into the new form all clothes and equipment they were originally carrying. While in beast form, the targets retained their morality and personality, but assumed the mentality and abilities of the beasts they became. This effect lasted for up to 1 hour, as long as the caster kept concentrating.

Unwilling creatures could attempt to resist the spell's effects. Unwilling [[shapechanger]]s were immune to the spell.

If the newly transformed beasts sustained an amount of damage that was sufficient to kill them, they reverted to their original, unaltered forms.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was a caterpillar cocoon.
