'''''Blood link''''' was an [[arcane]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to drain the life force from their target on touch. It was used in conjunction with a ''[[permanency]]'' or ''[[permanency prayer]]'' spell in the [[item enchantment|creation of magic items]].

==Morality==
The act of casting ''blood link'' was considered an [[evil]] act, and as such, [[good]]- and [[neutral]]-aligned spellcasters could lose favor with their deity.  

==Components==
The [[material component]]s for this spell were a drop of blood, three [[walnut]] shell halves and a [[chain]] carved from the wood of a [[zalantar]] tree.
