'''''Lorloveim's shadowy transformation''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s. This spell was developed by [[Lorloveim]].

==Effects==
This spell transformed a creature or nonliving material into insubstantial shadow. This spell had no effect on other spell effects such as ''[[wall of force]]''. Creatures affected by this spell could pass through the smallest opening but were unable to attack anything that was not native to the [[Ethereal plane]]. Enchanted weapons were needed to harm a creature transformed into shadow. All but the most powerful forms of [[undead]] would ignore a creature turned to shadow, believing them to be [[wraith]]s or a similar form of undead. If the spell was dispelled the creature would revert back to its normal form.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.
