Lorloveims shadowy transformation was an illusion spell used by wizards. This spell was developed by Lorloveim.
This spell transformed a creature or nonliving material into insubstantial shadow. This spell had no effect on other spell effects such as wall of force. Creatures affected by this spell could pass through the smallest opening but were unable to attack anything that was not native to the Ethereal plane. Enchanted weapons were needed to harm a creature transformed into shadow. All but the most powerful forms of undead would ignore a creature turned to shadow, believing them to be wraiths or a similar form of undead. If the spell was dispelled the creature would revert back to its normal form.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
