        "mainbody": "'''''Bigby's snapping digits''''' was a spell that created a hand of force to flick opponents.",
        "Effects": "Upon casting, this spell created a gigantic hand of force, with its index, ring, and little finger extended, and its middle finger curled back, resting underneath the thumb. The caster could move the hovering hand around at will, and upon the utterance of a command word, the middle finger would flick out from under the thumb and strike with considerable impact. This effect could be repeated multiple times with only a single casting.",
        "History": "The wizard [[Harkle Harpell]] invented ''Bigby's snapping digits'' as an iteration upon the ''[[Bigby's hand]]'' family of spells. In the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, he showed this spell off to [[Robillard]], bragging that he had \"improved on [[Bigby]]\"."
