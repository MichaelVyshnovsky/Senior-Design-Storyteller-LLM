Sunburst was a cleric prayer in the post-Spellplague era that simultaneously burned enemies and healed allies.
This prayer could be invoked at a distance of up to 50 ft (15 m) away and created a 25 ft (7.6 m) square of light that could burn each enemy with divine radiance and at the same time heal the caster and all allies within the area of effect. This prayer require at least a few minutes rest between castings.
