Psionic blast was a psionic power of the telepathy discipline that stunned a foes mind. It was sometimes called mind blast, and quite dreaded by non-psionic beings, but it was actually unrelated to an illithids mind blast.
Psionic blast emitted a wave of "brain force", originally forming a cone 60 feet (18 meters) long, 5 feet (1.5 meters) at its origin and 2 feet (6 meters) at its limit, later reduced to 30 feet (9 meters). It jolted the minds of those affected, like delivering "shocking news", and later outright blasted their minds as the name said, stunning them for several seconds. After the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, if an experienced manifester spent more psionic energy, they could augment the duration. After the Spellplague of 1385 DR, it emitted a flood of mental energy, in all directions to 25 feet (7.6 meters) dazing and even stunning creatures in the area, but it could not be augmented.
Psionic blast was originally one of the five attacks of psionic combat and was a way of making forced contact. and finally it was strongest against empty mind and weakest against mental barrier again.
Early versions required knowledge of mindlink to learn. 
Manifesting the power produced the standard auditory display. The force of the mental attack caused the very air to ripple.
"Psionic Blaster" was the title of the first rank of the clergy of Deep Duerra, the duergar goddess of psionics.
The ability to manifest a psionic blast was a requirement for becoming a cognition thief in the Hall of Mental Splendor.
Psionic blast could be learned by psionicists and psions, as well as by wilders.
It could be known by su-monsters and ikiryo.
In psionics terms, it could also be known by ki-rin, githyanki, and githzerai, and by astral devas, planetars, and solars among aasimon by pit fiends among baatezu by babaus, balors, mariliths, and nalfeshnees among tanarri and only by arcanaloths among yugoloths.
