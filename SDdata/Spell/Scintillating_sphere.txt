Scintillating sphere was a spell unique to Halruaa.
This spell allowed the caster to summon a small grape-sized ball of energy that traveled in a straight line where directed.
When the sphere reached the destination chosen by the caster, it would pulse twice and explode outward with electrical energy, damaging nearby creatures. The intensity of the explosion was based on the casters power.
This spell required a small glass sphere and a pinch of iron oxide to cast, as well as a verbal and somatic component.
