        "mainbody": "'''''Magic jar''''', which was originally called '''''Jarm's magic jar''''', was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used to trap one's [[soul]] in a [[gem]] or crystal.",
        "Effects": "Upon completing this powerful spell, the caster's soul leaves his or her body and enters a selected gemstone, the \"magic jar\", somewhere within medium range. The caster's body at this point appears to be dead.\n\nFor up to nine hours or more, the caster's soul in the magic jar can attempt to possess any nearby sentient creature, swapping souls with the target's body, such that the caster's soul controls the new body and the target's soul becomes trapped in the magic jar. A sentient creature up to {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} or more away from the gemstone could be possessed, depending on the power of the caster. If a target had the willpower to resist possession, the caster's soul would remain in the gem.\n\nThe caster could sense the presence of nearby lifeforms and had a sense of whether they were [[Positive energy|positive]] or [[negative energy]] beings and a relative idea of the strength of their life forces.\n\nA caster could shift from any possessed body back to the magic jar and could then attempt to possess a new body. When the spell duration expired, the caster would return to his or her original body if it was still within range of the gem. Otherwise, the caster's soul would be lost.\n\nIf a possessed body were killed or destroyed, the caster's soul would return to the magic jar, and the imprisoned soul would depart for the [[Fugue Plane]], since its body was now dead.\n\nCertain gemstones, such as [[citrine]] and [[chrysoberyl]], protected against possession by this spell.",
        "Components": "Any gem or crystal worth at least 100 [[gp]] was required to cast this spell, in addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.",
        "History": "The spell was invented by the wicked [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Jarm]]  in {{Yearlink|-1915}}.",
        "Trivia": "Fragments of a former ''magic jar'' were needed as a [[material component]] in ''[[protection from possession, 10' radius]]'', which protected against such spells."
