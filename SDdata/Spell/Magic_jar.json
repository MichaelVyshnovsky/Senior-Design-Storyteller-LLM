        "mainbody": "Magic jar, which was originally called Jarms magic jar, was a necromancy spell used to trap ones soul in a gem or crystal.\nUpon completing this powerful spell, the casters soul leaves his or her body and enters a selected gemstone, the \"magic jar\", somewhere within medium range. The casters body at this point appears to be dead.\nFor up to nine hours or more, the casters soul in the magic jar can attempt to possess any nearby sentient creature, swapping souls with the targets body, such that the casters soul controls the new body and the targets soul becomes trapped in the magic jar. A sentient creature up to  or more away from the gemstone could be possessed, depending on the power of the caster. If a target had the willpower to resist possession, the casters soul would remain in the gem.\nThe caster could sense the presence of nearby lifeforms and had a sense of whether they were positive or negative energy beings and a relative idea of the strength of their life forces.\nA caster could shift from any possessed body back to the magic jar and could then attempt to possess a new body. When the spell duration expired, the caster would return to his or her original body if it was still within range of the gem. Otherwise, the casters soul would be lost.\nIf a possessed body were killed or destroyed, the casters soul would return to the magic jar, and the imprisoned soul would depart for the Fugue Plane, since its body was now dead.\nCertain gemstones, such as citrine and chrysoberyl, protected against possession by this spell.\nAny gem or crystal worth at least 100 gp was required to cast this spell, in addition to verbal and somatic components.\nThe spell was invented by the wicked Netherese arcanist Jarm  in .\nFragments of a former magic jar were needed as a material component in protection from possession, 10 radius, which protected against such spells."
