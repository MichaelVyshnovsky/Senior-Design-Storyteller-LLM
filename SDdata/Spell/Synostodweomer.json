        "mainbody": "Synostodweomer, also known as Simbuls synostodweomer, was an arcane transmutation and necromancy spell that converted other spells into healing magic, or granted another creature some of the casters healing ability.\nBefore the Spellplague, wizards and sorcerers could use this spell to transform one of their other spells into positive energy that could be used as healing magic. First, synostodweomer was cast and then, within a minute, a second spell of any other kind was cast from memory. The second spell was expended but did not have its usual effect. Instead, the caster was imbued with a positive energy charge that could be transferred by touch to his- or herself, or to another creature. This healing charge had to be used immediately or it was lost. The amount of healing bestowed was somewhat random, but generally, higher level spells transmuted into more healing energy.\nOnly spells previously prepared by the caster could be altered by synostodweomer, not spells from wands or scrolls, or spell-like abilities, or effects from any other spell-storing device.\nAfter the Spellplague, when cast, synostodweomer essentially transferred one burst of healing from the caster to another nearby creature. The caster was not required to touch his or her target. This spell could be used again after a short period of rest.\nThe pre-Spellplague version of this spell required verbal and somatic components to cast, plus any material components required by the second spell. Both spells were expended, along with any material components in the usual fashion.\nThe Simbuls synostodweomer was recorded by Vaerendroon in his eponymously named book, Vaerendroons Ineffable Enchantments. It was later published in \"Volos Guide to All Things Magical\" and became generally known to the magical community although it was rare to find it.\nAfter the Spellplague, this spell was usually only wielded by Simbarchs of Aglarond or those that they trained."
