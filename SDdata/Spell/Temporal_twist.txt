'''''Temporal twist''''' was an [[utterance]] from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind that used [[truespeak]] that granted extra precious fractions of a second, or in its reversed form, it drew away time.

==Usage==
In its straight form, it reweaved time to grant just enough extra slack for an additional melee attack. It would not add up with other sources. In the reversed form, the target lost time, becoming dazed and unable to act for a few seconds.

==History==
The utterance was known to [[garbler]]s, in its reversed form.{{cite book/Tome of Magic 3.5|265}}
