Burrow was a transmutation spell that gave claws to burrow through the earth.
On casting burrow, the person touched by the casters hands started to glow yellow. The glow then became into translucent mole claws that were useful in combat. These claws could be used to burrow through mostly any ground that was not solid rock like badgers do.
The burrow spell required somatic and verbal components and a focus in the form of a claw of a burrowing animal. When cast as divine magic, the focus needed to be a divine one.  There was an older version of this spell that required material components instead of foci in the form of bit of fur from a burrowing animal as well as a tiny replica of a shovel.
