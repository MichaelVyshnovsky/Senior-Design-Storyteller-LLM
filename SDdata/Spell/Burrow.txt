'''''Burrow''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that gave claws to burrow through the earth.

==Effects==
On casting ''burrow'', the person touched by the caster's hands started to glow yellow. The glow then became into translucent mole claws that were useful in combat. These claws could be used to burrow through mostly any ground that was not solid rock like [[badger]]s do.

==Components==
The ''burrow'' spell required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s and a focus in the form of a claw of a burrowing [[animal]]. When cast as [[divine magic]], the focus needed to be a divine one.  There was an older version of this spell that required [[material component]]s instead of foci in the form of bit of fur from a burrowing animal as well as a tiny replica of a [[shovel]].
