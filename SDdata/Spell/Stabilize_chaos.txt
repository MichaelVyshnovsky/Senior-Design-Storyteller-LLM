Stabilize chaos was an alteration spell developed by planeswalker wizards to give them a reprieve while on the plane of Limbo.
While sentient beings in Limbo normally had to concentrate to maintain a pocket of stable reality, the stabilize chaos spell acted in place of such concentration, maintaining stable reality pockets whilst the casters busied themselves with other matters. This spell could only maintain the stability of a stable reality pocket, not increase its size or initiate the creation of one. Stabilize chaos lasted for a minimum of 1 hour and 10 minutes, but could last longer depending on the prowess of the spellcaster.
Outside of Limbo itself, this spell could also be utilized on any chaos matter that had somehow found its way outside of the plane.
Casting this spell required only somatic and verbal components.
Sometime in the 14 century DR, a duergar sage living in Acheron by the name of Gheldoin gifted a spellbook containing stabilize chaos to a group of Ravenian adventurers after they impressed him by deciphering the script on an old scroll that detailed a story about Laduguer.
