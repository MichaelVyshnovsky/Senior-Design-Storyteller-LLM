'''''Stabilize chaos''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] developed by [[planeswalker]] [[wizard]]s to give them a reprieve while on the [[plane]] of [[Limbo]].

==Effects==
While sentient beings in Limbo normally had to concentrate to maintain a pocket of stable reality, the ''stabilize chaos'' spell acted in place of such concentration, maintaining stable reality pockets whilst the casters busied themselves with other matters. This spell could only maintain the stability of a stable reality pocket, not increase its size or initiate the creation of one. ''Stabilize chaos'' lasted for a minimum of 1 hour and 10 minutes, but could last longer depending on the prowess of the spellcaster.

Outside of Limbo itself, this spell could also be utilized on any chaos matter that had somehow found its way outside of the plane.

==Components==
Casting this spell required only [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s.

==History==
Sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[duergar]] sage living in [[Acheron]] by the name of [[Gheldoin]] gifted a [[spellbook]] containing ''stabilize chaos'' to a group of [[Ravenian]] [[adventurer]]s after they impressed him by deciphering the script on an old [[scroll]] that detailed a story about [[Laduguer]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Stone and Steel|15,17}}
