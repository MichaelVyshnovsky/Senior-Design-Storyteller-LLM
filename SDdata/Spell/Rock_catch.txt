Rock catch was a transmutation spell that allowed a target, chosen by the spellcaster, to do exactly what its name would imply catch rocks. Specifically, this spell allowed someone to catch rocks, and other such projectiles such as the ammunition of a catapult or stone trap, up to 16 sq. or 64 cu. ft. The catch of these boulders would then must put them down immediately, as there were no specifications in the spell about holding these caught rocks.
