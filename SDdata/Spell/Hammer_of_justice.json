        "mainbody": "Hammer of justice was a more advanced version of the common detect lie spell utilized specifically by the clerics of the Church of Tyr, which included the illusory element of a glowing warhammer to indicate truth or falsehood.\nWhen cast, the spell created the illusion of a floating, glowing, upright warhammer of steel-gray color, at a distance of up to  or more from the caster. The hammer would remain at this distance and follow the caster wherever she or he moved.\nAnyone within range of the hammer could be questioned by the caster. Tyrs power ensured that the truth or falsehood of any answers to the casters questions would be revealed by the color of the hammer. If the answer was truthful, the hammer would glow blazing white. If the answer was false, the hammer would turn black. If the answer were technically true but deceitful, the hammer would turn the color of red blood.Originally, when published in Faiths & Avatars, the hammer would still indicate the truth of the matter even from a questionee who knew nothing about the actual answer. This was corrected in later sources, perhaps because it was overpowered. If someone being asked a question stepped out of range of the hammer, the hammer indicated this by becoming faded in appearance.\nThe hammer of justice was immune to all forms of attack and damage and could not be dispelled or dismissed, not even by the caster. It could not be moved by any means other than the movement of the caster. The only defenses against its power were a limited number of powerful spells that could create a barrier between it and the one wanting to avoid having lies detected.\nAfter a duration of at least nine minutes, the spell would suddenly go dark and drop to the ground, where it would fade from existence.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components and a miniature warhammer fashioned from a pure natural substance of black, white, or red, such as obsidian, ivory, or glass."
