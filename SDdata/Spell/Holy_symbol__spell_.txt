Holy symbol was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur.
A shugenja used this spell to create a holy symbol of their deity from a mundane item. The chosen item was required to be made by an appropriate material, and the shugenja was only able to make a holy symbol of their own deity. Depending on the alignment of the shugenja, the holy symbol radiated evil or good.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component.
