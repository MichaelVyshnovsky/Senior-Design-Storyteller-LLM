Circle of power was an abjuration spell for paladins that created a sphere of divine radiance centered on the caster.
The  sphere gave all allies of the caster within it an advantage to resist spells cast against them. An affected ally who was able to withstand a spell and suffer only partial damage would instead take no damage from the spell.
Only a verbal component was needed.
