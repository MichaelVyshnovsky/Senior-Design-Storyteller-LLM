        "mainbody": "Tsunami was a conjuration spell that summoned a massive wave. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur,\nThe caster was only able to cast this spell on a large body of water, such as an ocean or a large lake. The summoned tsunami acted in the same way a natural occurring one would. The wave travelled in the direction chosen by the caster. Wooden buildings and ships caught in the wave were destroyed. \nThe spell required verbal and somatic components. In addition, the wu jen version of this spell required material components, a scale from either a li lung or a tun mi lung, which was mixed with water from a water elemental."
