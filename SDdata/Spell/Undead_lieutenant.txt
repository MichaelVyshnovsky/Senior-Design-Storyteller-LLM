'''''Undead lieutenant''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
A caster used this spell to designate a targeted [[undead]] creature as the leader of other undead creatures under the control of the caster. The targeted undead creature had to possess a certain level of intelligence. They were able to give orders to the other undead creatures and they were obeyed as if given by the caster. Any order given by the caster overrode orders from the ''undead lieutenant''.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
