The green elves continued to live contentedly as small, scattered tribes and worshiped the [[Faerie gods]] (rather than the then-unknown Seldarine). However, one tribe, the [[Ilythiiri]], negotiated with the dragons and established a small southern kingdom based around their capital, [[Atorrnash]], which stood as a glorious example of elven culture for millennia to come.\n\n''Circa'' {{yearlink|-25400}}, following the fall of [[Tintageer]] in the world of [[Faerie]], a small band of gold elves led by Prince [[Durothil]], together with a single silver elf, [[Sharlario Moonflower]], searched for a new home. A [[divination]] showed them the world of Toril and the gold elf priestess [[Bonnalurie]] died to open a ''gate'' there that allowed the elven refugees of Tintageer through. They settled on a continent they named ''[[Faerûn]]'', meaning \"the One Land\". They mixed with the existing green elves and gave rise to the sun elves, while the descendants of Sharlario Moonflower became known as the moon elves.\n\nElves reigned on Toril in relative peace until {{yearlink|-11800}}, when the sun elf nation of [[Aryvandaar]] invaded the dark elf and green elf nation of [[Miyeritar]], starting the first of the five [[Crown Wars]], which lasted for a total of 3000 years.\n\nAt the end of the Fourth Crown War, the dark elf Ilythiiri were banished to the [[Underdark]] ''circa'' {{yearlink|-10000}}, becoming the drow. Finally, the Fifth Crown War that followed resolved matters, ending the conflicts. The Tel-quessir remained at peace with each other (with, of course the exception of the drow).\n\nThe green elves suffered many defeats in the Crown Wars and by the end of the conflict had lost all of their former territory. Withdrawing into the wilderness, the green elves gradually diverged from the high elves. The green elves who remained in isolation became the wild elves and lost their taste for civilization and nation-building, becoming nomadic wanderers. Others became the first of the wood elves.\n\nThe wood elves, unlike the wild elves, continued to build civilizations, though on a smaller scale. In the eastern [[High Forest]], the wood elves founded the kingdom of [[Eaerlann]], a contemporary and ally of [[Netheril]].\n\nFor many millennia, thousands of Tel-quessir, particularly moon elves and sun elves, left Faerûn for the isle of Evermeet in a long migration known as [[the Retreat]]. However, by [[1374 DR]] most of the Tel-quessir who desired to leave had already done so, as remarked upon by [[Cambrizym]] of [[Candlekeep]], and in fact, the Retreat began a gradual reversal, with many who had left or their children returned to the continent.",
        "Description": "Although individual Tel-quessir races exhibited a number of unique traits, there were some features which were common to all of the races. Elves tended to be fair and beautiful by human standards and graceful, though they were often frail as well. Elves had a similar range of complexions to [[human]]s, with wood elves typically coppery or pale skinned and wild elves having darker pigmentation. Often, elven hair was dark, either brown or black, with copper red or blond hair also found amongst wood elves, although orange or even green hues were not completely unheard of. Elven eyes were commonly brown, hazel, or an emerald green. Elves had pointed ears and had no hair on their body save eyebrows, eyelashes, and scalp hair.",
        "Personality": "Elves commonly possessed strong but swiftly passing passions, being moved easily to laughter, anger, or misery and as quickly calmed. They were known for their impulsive behavior and, as a result, many races saw them as flighty or impetuous. However, elves were not as flaky as others might interpret them to be, and they were typically responsible despite their almost whimsical nature. Partially due to their long lifespan (though not entirely, since many long-lived races acted differently), elves had difficulty taking some matters as seriously as other races, but when threats they recognize did arise, elves were strong friends and allies to those they were loyal to.\n\nElves tended to make strong and uplifting friends. Most elves loved simple joys such as dancing, singing, footraces, or contests of skill. They had a natural aversion to that which they saw as uninteresting tasks and were fun-loving by nature. However, despite how unpleasant some things such as war could be, elves became grimly serious if a threat to their friends, family, or livelihood made such actions necessary.\n\nElves were a relaxed people, with a degree of patience and detachment granted to them by their long lifespans. Elves were not easily excited and lack the greed that sometimes characterized other races. Most elves were unconcerned with the events that only affected the short-term and were likewise slow to make friends or enemies since time for them was measured in centuries, not decades. Focused on whatever they applied themselves to, elves ignored the slight but rarely forgot the serious.\n\nBecause of their long lifespan, most elves had a patience uncommon to other humanoids. Tel-quessir viewed the lives and concerns of younger races as fleeting and took less joy in the short-term victories that other races had to content themselves with. Instead, elves took pleasure in things that had more endurance, such as the arts or the honing of one's skills.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Lifespan": "Elves were universally long-lived, achieving what they consider adulthood at 110 years of age and living for up to 700 and more years thereafter.  However, wood and wild elves matured at roughly the same rate as humans, but did not display many signs of ageing past adulthood, with the most obvious changes being a change in hair color, alternatively graying or darkening. Most of these elves remained healthy and full of life up until their death, which was usually well over two centuries.",
            "Reverie": "Many elves did not sleep, instead finding their rest in a meditative state called [[reverie]] or \"trance\", which was as restful as true sleep but left them aware of their surroundings. In this state, they achieved the same results as a human might through sleeping in roughly two thirds the time. Elves able to trance were also often resistant to the effects of supernatural powers such as ''[[sleep]]'', since they did not themselves sleep but instead rested in a semi-aware state.<ref>"
        },
        "Society": {
            "Relations": "\"Tel-quessir\" was the elven word for \"the people.\" Likewise, \"N-Tel-Quess\" was the elven word for \"not people\" and was used to refer to races outside of the Tel-quessir. This often gave other races the impression that elves were elitist, racist, and condescending to other races, but most simply saw these as words with no hidden meaning or agenda.\n\nAlthough the other races sometimes believed elves to be arrogant and condescending, they didn't hold any particular hatred for any races as a whole, though individual races may have had particular attitudes. The harshest racial conflict for the elves was actually often within, given the long-standing feud between the drow and the other Tel-quessir races. Elves could seem distant and unfriendly because many of the other races, such as humans and halflings, had a much shorter lifespan. It was easier for an elf to avoid contact with these races, rather than befriend individuals who lived only a small fraction of the elven life.\n\n[[Dwarves]] and elves generally had a different problem in forming relationships. Dwarves favored hard work whereas elves generally enjoyed relaxation. Dwarves enjoyed carving homes from the rock and engineering unswerving straight lines, while elves preferred more natural, flowing shapes. Dwarves and elves could form strong bonds of friendship, but only when both agreed to overlook each other's differences.\n\n[[Gnome]]s and elves generally got along well thanks to their mutual love of life, combined with the gnomes' love of fine art and [[illusion]] magic. On the other hand, [[halfling]]s and elves shared only a lukewarm relationship. The elven habit of eating sparingly was not welcomed in halfling society, and elves sometimes deemed a halfling's curiosity as childlike and troublesome.\n\nElves regarded [[human]]s with both fear and respect. Humans grasped magic and adapted to many situations incredibly fast from an elven perspective, but they were wary of the human tendency to claim lands as their own, often regarding them as greedy. It was quite possible for strong friendships to develop between humans and elves, but it was equally possible that hostilities might arise.",
            "Homelands": "Elves tended to favor woodlands over other terrains, though exceptions existed. Most elven communities were relatively small in size, around a few hundred in number, and blended easily into the natural landscape. These communities were usually very well isolated and as a result contact between elves and outsiders was usually a matter of deliberate contact rather than accidental.\n\nWood and wild elves were usually found in small tribes throughout the forests of Toril, as well as on windswept plains and in mountain vales. They preferred these secluded places of nature to the cities and nations of the civilized world, living in harmony with their natural surroundings. Cautious and cunning warriors, particularly of the bow, elves secured these homelands through guile and tactics."
        },
        "Culture": {
            "Diet": "Elves were typically omnivorous, like humans, but tended to eat very little meat. This was not so much out of concern for the animal as an effort to make as little of an impact on the natural world as possible, with elves believing that the consumption of vegetation had a lesser impact on natural harmony. Additionally, this partially came from many elven cultures' traditions of nomadic life, which required food to be easily preservable.",
            "Subraces": "[[File:Elves.jpg|thumb|300px|''From left to right: a human, sun elf, wood elf, moon elf, drow, and wild elf.'']]\nThere were at least nine different subraces{{Cite dragon/361/A Fractured Family|8-12}}\n\nMany elves were quite proud of their particular sub-race. It was said that to insult a moon elf, call him a gray elf. To insult a sun elf, call him a moon elf."
