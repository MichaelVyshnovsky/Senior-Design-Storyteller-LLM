'''''Seclusion''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[numbers sphere]] that sealed a single target in an extradimensional space.

==Effects==
This spell only functioned when used against man-sized creatures. The casting [[priest]] could use the spell on themselves or a single touched target and could only hold a single target at a time regardless of their size. The ''secluded'' individual was invisbile to outsiders and undetectable by any form of [[magic]] while within the extradimensional space. They could see and hear everything going on around them, but could not cast spells or affect the outside world in any way. The extradimensional space was immobile while active, but would follow the caster around when empty or occupied by anyone but the caster. The caster could come and go as they wished, but anyone else could only be released when the caster allowed it. Anyone remaining within the extradimensional space when the spell ended was violently ejected when the spell expired, causing a bit of physical harm. The presence of another extradimensional space within the one created by ''seclusion'', such as a ''[[bag of holding]]'', would cause both spaces to rupture.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a [[gemstone]] worth at least 250 [[gp]] and a finely crafted crystal box worth at least 1,500 gp to cast. The gem was consumed during the casting but the box was not.

==History==
The ''[[Scepter of Mystra]]'', a relic of the [[Mystra]]n faith, could cast the ''seclusion'' spell.{{cite book/Prayers from the Faithful|77-80}}
