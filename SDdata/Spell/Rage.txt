Rage was a spell that made the targets violently angry. and was associated with Malar while the later-developed arcane version was included within the school of enchantment and the sub-school of compulsion.
Rage instilled rage inside the targets. This rage was similar to that of a barbarian while it was not as effective it also was not as exhausting.
The divine version of the spell significantly increased the might of the individual it affected.
While the divine version of this spell required only verbal components, the arcane variety also had a somatic component.
