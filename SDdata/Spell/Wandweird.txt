Wandweird was a wizard spell from the school of abjuration.
This spell created an invisible sphere centered on the caster that moved with them, protecting them from any attacks from enemy wands. The casters wands were also prevented from working as well within the sphere. Harmful effects from wands outside of the sphere simply exploded against the surface without penetrating before they were absorbed. Other wand effects were simply absorbed by the sphere.
All absorbed energy could be released at a target of the casters choosing in a blast of pure magical energy when the spell expired. An enemy who managed to successfully dispel the sphere would find the stored energy released at them immediately.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a piece of wood resembling a wand to cast. The caster needed to cast any spell into the wood before using it for the wandweird.
