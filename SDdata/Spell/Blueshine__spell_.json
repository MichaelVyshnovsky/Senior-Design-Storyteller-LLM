        "mainbody": "Blueshine was an alteration spell that protected metals and metallic items by enhancing them with the blueshine property.\nWhen this spell was cast upon a metal item, any fractures or weaknesses within it were immediately repaired. This included damage caused by combat, caustic materials, and even the natural processes of rust and oxidation. In the latter case, these effects were removed with no decrease in the items structural integrity. Regardless of the damage done, the item was restored to a pristine condition free from any blemishes or markings.\nIn addition, the metal affected by this spell became much more resistant to acid and other corrosive substances and was immune to future rusting. In addition, it shone with a deep blue gleam whenever it caught natural light.\nAny item could be affected by this spell, even those comprising a number of different inorganic substances, so long as they were equal or less than the total volume of the spellcasters body. Some organic matter could be included within the affected item, as long as it did not take up more than 1/10 of its total volume. \nThis spell was developed by the Calishite wizard Toth. Shortly thereafter, its specifications were stolen by a rival mage and Toth was killed by the Red Wizards of Thay, who sought the formula for their own ends.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a shard of cobalt-blue glass or a chip taken from a blue gemstone such as a sapphire."
