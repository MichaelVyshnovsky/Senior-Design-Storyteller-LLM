Know age was a common spell used by clerics.
When cast, this spell revealed instantly to the caster the age of a targeted creature, individual or object. The spell was accurate to within one year of the actual age.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a page from a calendar.
Know age was one of the spells contained within the Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the faith of Mystra. It was also found in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy spellbook of the Church of Mielikki.
