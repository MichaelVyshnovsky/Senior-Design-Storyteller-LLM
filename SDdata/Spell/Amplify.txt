Amplify was a simple alteration spell used to alter the volume of sound. This spell was created by the famed wizard Darsson Spellmaker.
This spell allowed the caster the change the volume of sounds near the spells area of effect, lasting for several hours depending on the skill of the caster. The effected disk-shaped area glowed softly from the magics effects. Sound entering the casters side of the disk exited up to five times louder or softer than the original sound.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a cone of paper to cast.
