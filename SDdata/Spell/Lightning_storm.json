        "mainbody": "Lightning storm was an evocation spell used by wizards.\nThis spell created a series of lightning strikes within a sphere measuring  in diameter. The magic of the spell kept the lightning from reaching beyond the edge of the sphere. Any creature within the sphere, with the exception of the caster, was hit repeatedly with savage lightning strikes. The caster was also immune to any other electrical-based attack while their lightning storm was active.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a shard of glass, a scrap of fur, a flint, and a piece of silver to cast."
