'''''Sour''''' was a reversed [[cantrip]] that initiate [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It created a small quantity of [[vinegar]] in a target food, drink, open container, or other object.

==Effects==
This cantrip had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and could target one item of food or drink that was not in a closed container, or could be cast at a point just above an object, similar to the ''[[Salt (cantrip)|salt]]'' or ''[[Spice (spell)|spice]]'' cantrip. The quantity of vinegar created was limited to a maximum of {{SI|1|pt|L|long=yes}}.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster clenched one hand into a fist while making a ''whoosh'' sound through pursed lips.
