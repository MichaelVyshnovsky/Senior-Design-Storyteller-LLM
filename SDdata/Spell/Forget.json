        "mainbody": "Forget was an arcane enchantment spell that caused targets to lose recent memories.\nUpon casting, the affected targets forgot events that occurred one minute before the spell was cast. The skill of the caster determined how many previous minutes were forgotten by the targets. It affected up to a maximum of four targets within a  cube. The smaller the number of targets selected by the caster, the harder it was for them to resist the spells magic.\nForget did not negate the effects of spells like charm, suggestion, geas, or quest, but it could potentially cause the target of such spells to forget the one whod enspelled them.\nThe only way of restoring the erased memories was with a special casting of heal or restoration, or else a limited wish or wish.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThe alchemist Thoround of Nimpeth reported that the spittle or blood of humans affected by a certain disease were useful in the making of ink for writing a forget spell, making it simpler and cheaper.\nIt was considered an uncommon spell circa 1358 DR.\nThis spell was found within Bowgentles Book."
