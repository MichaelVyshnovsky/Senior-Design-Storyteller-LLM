        "mainbody": "'''''Forget''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that caused targets to lose recent memories.",
        "Effects": "Upon casting, the affected targets forgot events that occurred one minute before the spell was cast. The skill of the caster determined how many previous minutes were forgotten by the targets. It affected up to a maximum of four targets within a {{SIAdj|20|ft|long=yes}} cube. The smaller the number of targets selected by the caster, the harder it was for them to resist the spell's magic.\n\n''Forget'' did not negate the effects of spells like ''[[charm]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''[[geas]]'', or ''[[quest]]'', but it could potentially cause the target of such spells to forget the one who'd enspelled them.\n\nThe only way of restoring the erased memories was with a special casting of ''[[heal]]'' or ''[[restoration]]'', or else a ''[[limited wish]]'' or ''[[wish]]''.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.\n\nThe [[alchemist]] [[Thoround]] of [[Nimpeth]] reported that the spittle or blood of [[human]]s affected by a [[Unidentified disease (Vilhon Reach)|certain disease]] were useful in the making of [[ink]] for writing a ''forget'' spell, making it simpler and cheaper.{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}",
        "History": "It was considered an uncommon spell ''circa'' [[1358 DR]].<ref>",
