        "mainbody": "'''''Imbue with spell ability''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] or [[enchantment]] spell that allowed the caster to bequeath a small number of spells to another creature.",
        "Effects": "A divine spellcaster with this spell (or ability, in the case of the [[divine disciple]]) had to touch another creature that had sufficient wisdom and intelligence to hold the divine energies and to cast them effectively. The enchantment version of this spell was limited to non-spellcasting persons, including [[ranger]]s and [[paladin]]s who had not yet achieved their spellcasting abilities, and only defensive, informational, or healing spells could be transferred. The evocation version worked on any creature that met the minimum requirements and was limited to spells from the [[abjuration]] and [[divination]] schools, or the healing subschool of [[conjuration]].\n\nDepending on the age or experience of the creature touched, up to two basic spells and one slightly more advanced spell could be transferred from the mind of the caster to the mind of the target. While the spell or spells resided in the mind of the target, there was a void in the mind of the caster where those spells originated. The caster could not fill this void with new spells until the imbued spells were discharged by the target, the target died, or the caster dispelled the ''imbue''.\n\nWhen the recipient chose to cast an imbued spell, it had all the characteristics of a spell being cast by the originator, including range, duration, ''etc.''&mdash;the imbued creature only carried the spell for the caster and chose where and when to use it. The divine spellcaster was responsible to their [[deity]] and their principles for how an imbued spell was used, just as if they had cast it themselves.",
        "Divine Disciples": "When a [[divine disciple]] reached the third stage of training, he or she acquired the ability to cast this spell once per day without having to prepare the spell. The transferred spells had to be prepared as usual.",
        "Components": "For the caster of this spell, [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, including touching the recipient, were required, plus the caster's [[holy symbol]]. For the enchantment version, a minor item that was representative or symbolic of their profession was also required, such as a [[lockpicks|lockpick]] from a [[thief]] or a dishrag from a barkeep. This item, and any [[material component]]s for the imbued spells were consumed at the time of casting ''imbue with spell ability''. For the evocation version, the recipient had to be able to speak any verbal component, had to have hand-like appendages to form any somatic gestures, and had to be in possession of any required material components in order to cast the imbued spells."
