        "mainbody": "Net of shadows was a spell used by sorcerers and wizards.\nWith this spell, a caster could blind a creature by using ordinary shadows. The shadows flew to the creature and wrapped them in a net of darkness. Within this net, the creature was unable to see anything beyond . Darkvision was rendered useless. Additionally, the creature was disoriented while within the net. The net of shadow did not hinder the creatures movement.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
