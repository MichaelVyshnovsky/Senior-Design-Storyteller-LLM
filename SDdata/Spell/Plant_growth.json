        "mainbody": "Plant growth was a transmutation or alteration spell that caused plants to grow.\nThis spell could be cast in two different ways as a means of creating a barrier (nicknamed overgrowth) or as a means of promoting better crop yields (enrichment).\nOvergrowth The area to be affected had to contain sufficient vegetation for this spell to work. When cast, it caused all the plants in the area to grow in a twisting, interlocking fashion to form a thicket or dense jungle that required force or hacking to penetrate. Creatures attempting to cross the affected area were slowed tremendously. Large creatures were slowed significantly, but not as much as medium sized creatures. The transmutation version of this spell could be cast on a circle of radius 100 ft (30.5 m), a semicircle of radius 150 ft (45.7 m) or a quarter circle of radius 200 ft (61 m), and could contain regions that were unaffected if desired (hedge maze, anyone?). The alteration version was applied to a rectangular area equivalent to a square with sides of 20 ft (6.1 m) per caster level.\nEnrichment Usually cast in the spring when fields have just been planted, this spell could increase crop yields for the entire year by making the plants more robust and productive. The transmutation version of this spell affected all plants in a circle 1 mile (1.6 km) in diameter (503 acres or 203 hectares). The alteration version enriched 1 square mile (2.6 km2) of plants (640 acres or 259 hectares).\nPlant growth counters and is countered by diminish plants.\nThis spell had no affect on plant creatures.\nThe oldest druid version of this spell only created overgrowth and not enrichment.\nVerbal and somatic components, plus the casters holy symbol or divine focus, were required to cast this spell.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Stoca in  and was originally called Stocas flora growth."
