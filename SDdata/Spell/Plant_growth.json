        "mainbody": "'''''Plant growth''''' was a [[transmutation]] or [[alteration]] spell that caused plants to grow.",
        "Effects": "This spell could be cast in two different ways: as a means of creating a barrier (nicknamed ''overgrowth'') or as a means of promoting better crop yields (''enrichment'').\n\n''Overgrowth:'' The area to be affected had to contain sufficient vegetation for this spell to work. When cast, it caused all the plants in the area to grow in a twisting, interlocking fashion to form a thicket or dense jungle that required force or hacking to penetrate. Creatures attempting to cross the affected area were slowed tremendously. Large creatures were slowed significantly, but not as much as medium sized creatures. The transmutation version of this spell could be cast on a circle of radius 100 ft (30.5 m), a semicircle of radius 150 ft (45.7 m) or a quarter circle of radius 200 ft (61 m), and could contain regions that were unaffected if desired (hedge maze, anyone?). The alteration version was applied to a rectangular area equivalent to a square with sides of 20 ft (6.1 m) per caster level.\n\n''Enrichment:'' Usually cast in the spring when fields have just been planted, this spell could increase crop yields for the entire year by making the plants more robust and productive. The transmutation version of this spell affected all plants in a circle 1 mile (1.6 km) in diameter (503 acres or 203 hectares). The alteration version enriched 1 square mile (2.6 km<sup>2</sup>) of plants (640 acres or 259 hectares).\n\n''Plant growth'' counters and is countered by ''[[diminish plants]]''.\n\nThis spell had no affect on plant creatures.\n\nThe oldest druid version of this spell only created ''overgrowth'' and not ''enrichment''.",
        "Components": "Verbal and somatic components, plus the caster's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]], were required to cast this spell.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Stoca]] in {{Yearlink|-1797}} and was originally called ''Stoca's flora growth''."
