Trick was an uncommon spell of the southern magic tradition.
The spell was a powerful illusion that allowed the caster to exchange their appearance and position with any creature within the spells area of affect, which was 80 yards (24 meters). The caster and the target creature both share the same voice and physical characteristics, so it appears that no switch even occurred. True seeing detected this illusion. There was some risk involved, since the teleport was not without error.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a ball of wax.
