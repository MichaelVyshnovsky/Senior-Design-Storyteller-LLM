        "mainbody": "'''''Weavecall''''' was a [[spell]] that granted the caster an immense boost in power, borrowed from the ''[[Weave]]'' for another spell.",
        "Effects": "After casting the spell, up to two targets chosen by the caster, one of which could be the caster themselves, had another minute to unleash another spell with power temporarily snatched from the ''[[Weave]]''. That spell would strike with a boost to its accuracy greater than that of even the most powerful of conventional weapons, severely undermined the target's chance at avoiding the worst of its effects, and increased the effects to the point they could hardly be any greater.\n\nHowever, no caster could memorize more than one such spell at a time, instantly ''[[feeblemind]]ing'' themselves if they attempted to. Furthermore, if the area of effect of a ''weavecall'' boosted spell was the location of another so-magnified spell within a period of about six months, the second spell's only effect would be reversing gravity for the caster, throwing them about {{SI|150|feet|long=yes}} into the air.",
        "Components": "Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were necessary to cast this spell.",
        "History": "[[Azuth]] made this spell available through [[Elminster]] sometime prior to {{yearlink|1370}}.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|101}}"
