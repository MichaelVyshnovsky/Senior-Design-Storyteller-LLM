        "mainbody": "Burning blood was a transmutation spell used by dragons. It struck back at attackers with blood suffused by the casters breath weapon.\nThis spell had no effect unless the caster had a breath weapon that dealt damage based on fire, cold, electricity, or acid. Once cast, every time the user was wounded, their blood would splash out from the wound, carrying with it the power of their breath weapon against any creatures within . Though the damage was not comparable with that of similar spells, it continued to increase with the users skill, and endured for many hours.\nThe spell called for verbal and somatic components."
