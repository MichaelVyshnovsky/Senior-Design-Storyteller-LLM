        "mainbody": "Mirage wall was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell created an illusionary wall wherever the caster could see. The wall was not confined to a rectangular shape and could be of any shape the caster desired. The wall could be used to cloak living creatures or to create any kind of scene the caster wished. The mirage wall would disappear if the caster willed it, a dispel magic or similar spell was cast upon it, or if a living creature walked through it.\nThis spell required an eyelash, a pinch of sand, and some sweat to cast."
