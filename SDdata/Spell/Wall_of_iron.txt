'''''Wall of iron''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that created a dense [[iron]] barrier.

==Effect==
When cast, this spell created a wall of iron. This was was vertical and always flat, and was often used to block passages or repair a wall. The thickness of the wall was determined by the caster's skill level. The wall could not be summoned if the space was already occupied by a creature or an item. The spell could also be used as a weapon. In this case, a caster summoned the wall in an area where it was not supported on any side. The wall was then pushed and if the timing was correct, would crush any creature on the other side. The wall was vulnerable to the elements, and a powerful creature was able to breach the wall.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material components that were needed were a small piece of sheet iron, as well as [[gold]] dust worth 50 [[gp]].

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Mavin]] in {{Yearlink|-587}} and was originally called ''Mavin's iron wall''.
