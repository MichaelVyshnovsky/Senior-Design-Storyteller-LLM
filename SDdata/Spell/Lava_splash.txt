Lava splash was a divine conjuration spell that created a wave of lava.
The lava wave splashed over a designated area some 40 feet (12.2 meters) wide and 20 feet (6.1 meters) high. Creatures standing in the area were hurt by the scorching hot lava that poured over them. The more experienced the caster, the more damage the lava would deal to their opponents.
Anyone wearing metal armor who was caught in the blast suffered damage as if they were affected by the spell heat metal.
Lava splash acted as a cure moderate wounds spell to firenewts.
One needed a fist-sized chunk of volcanic rock as a focus for the spell to be cast. It could not be cast unless there was natural lava within 90 (27.4 m) of the caster.
The lava splash spell was only used by firenewt clerics of Kossuth.
