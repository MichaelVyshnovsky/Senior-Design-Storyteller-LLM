'''''Weavestrike''''' was a [[spell]] of awesome power that could disable even the most hardened target.

==Effects==
The only limitation of the ''weavestrike'' was its range; the target had to be within it, about {{SI|180|yards|long=yes}} or maybe more, at the beginning of the casting. Once cast, there was no possible ward that blocked the spell. All one could do was shift to another plane; if they did, the ''weavestrike'' would remain in the plane where it was cast, for 18 days or maybe more, waiting for the target to return. If the target did not return in that time, the ''weavestrike'' spell was wasted.

The target's own endurance or resistance were not a factor, and there was no defense; each of a ''weavestrike'''s three effects was just as likely to take effect as not. The primary effect was paralyzing the target for a day; the second effect was placing the target in a coma. The third effect, the most powerful, was almost certain to take effect; it stripped the target of all spellcasting ability for about a month- unless the caster willed it to lift sooner.

Priests, [[beholder]]s, [[dragon]]s, [[dragonet]]s and [[ki-rin]] were all immune to the coma and "blanking" effects of the spell.

==Components==
Besides [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell's material component was a pebble washed up on a beach, a pinch of bonedust or fragment of bone from a creature slain by ''weavestrike'' or by the spells of a [[Magister]] during their reign.

==History==
[[Azuth]] made this spell available through [[Elminster]] sometime prior to {{yearlink|1370}}.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|101}}
