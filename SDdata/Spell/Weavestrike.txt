Weavestrike was a spell of awesome power that could disable even the most hardened target.
The only limitation of the weavestrike was its range the target had to be within it, about  or maybe more, at the beginning of the casting. Once cast, there was no possible ward that blocked the spell. All one could do was shift to another plane if they did, the weavestrike would remain in the plane where it was cast, for 18 days or maybe more, waiting for the target to return. If the target did not return in that time, the weavestrike spell was wasted.
The targets own endurance or resistance were not a factor, and there was no defense each of a weavestrikes three effects was just as likely to take effect as not. The primary effect was paralyzing the target for a day the second effect was placing the target in a coma. The third effect, the most powerful, was almost certain to take effect it stripped the target of all spellcasting ability for about a month- unless the caster willed it to lift sooner.
Priests, beholders, dragons, dragonets and ki-rin were all immune to the coma and "blanking" effects of the spell.
Besides verbal and somatic components, the spells material component was a pebble washed up on a beach, a pinch of bonedust or fragment of bone from a creature slain by weavestrike or by the spells of a Magister during their reign.
Azuth made this spell available through Elminster sometime prior to .
