        "mainbody": "'''''Antimagic aura''''' was a defensive [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, an invisible barrier enclosed the caster or a targeted creature. This barrier was able to withstand most spells and supernatural abilities. Additionally, the spell made it so magical items within the barrier were stripped of their magical effects while within its confines. This meant any creature within the barrier was unable to cast spells. The space within the barrier only suppressed magical abilities and effects, it did not dispel them.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a a tiny amount of [[iron]] dust or fillings."
