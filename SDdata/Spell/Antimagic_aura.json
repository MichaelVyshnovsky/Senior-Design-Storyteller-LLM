        "mainbody": "Antimagic aura was a defensive spell used by sorcerers and wizards.\nWhen cast, an invisible barrier enclosed the caster or a targeted creature. This barrier was able to withstand most spells and supernatural abilities. Additionally, the spell made it so magical items within the barrier were stripped of their magical effects while within its confines. This meant any creature within the barrier was unable to cast spells. The space within the barrier only suppressed magical abilities and effects, it did not dispel them.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a a tiny amount of iron dust or fillings."
