Haunting tune was a spell used by bards.
When cast, the spell caused sentient creatures to enter into a deep depression. This was accomplished by the creatures hearing the spell. It could be sung or read as a poem. The effects lasted until the spell expired.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
