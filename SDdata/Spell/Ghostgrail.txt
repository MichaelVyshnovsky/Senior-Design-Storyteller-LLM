'''''Ghostgrail''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the schools of [[abjuration]], [[alteration]], and [[necromancy]].

==Effects==
This spell imparted immunity to the caster, or a target they selected, from all special powers from the [[undead]] such as [[mummy rot]]. This spell had no affect on physical attacks from undead nor did it offer protection from spells cast by undead. ''Ghostgrail'' also allowed the spell target to use normal weapons, instead of magical or [[silver]] weapons, to harm undead at all times.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]] some dust from a coffin or burial slab to cast.
