Ghostgrail was a wizard spell from the schools of abjuration, alteration, and necromancy.
This spell imparted immunity to the caster, or a target they selected, from all special powers from the undead such as mummy rot. This spell had no affect on physical attacks from undead nor did it offer protection from spells cast by undead. Ghostgrail also allowed the spell target to use normal weapons, instead of magical or silver weapons, to harm undead at all times.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component some dust from a coffin or burial slab to cast.
