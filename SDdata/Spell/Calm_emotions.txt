'''''Calm emotions''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that attempted to negate strong emotions in a group of creatures.

==Effects==
The creatures affected by this spell in a 20 ft (6 m) radius area were brought to a emotionally neutral state. A group of angered people would be calmed and not considered hostile unless they were attacked or the effect ended and they still felt motivated to fight.

The effect would suppress other spells that effected the mind or mood like ''[[fear]]'' or ''[[emotion]]'', and also abilities like the magic of a [[bard]]'s song or a [[barbarian]]s rage. When ''calm emotions'' ended, the suppressed spells would resurface.

==Components==
Only verbal and somatic components were needed. or a [[divine focus]].
