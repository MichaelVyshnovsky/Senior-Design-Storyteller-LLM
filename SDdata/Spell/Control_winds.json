        "mainbody": "Control winds was a transmutation or alteration spell that allowed the caster to control wind.\nWhen cast, the spell allowed the caster to control the winds in a targeted area. The spell allowed the caster to increase or decrease the speed of the prevailing winds, from a zephyr to a hurricane. The spell also allowed the caster to create downdrafts and updrafts, create an area of calm air, or create a short burst of powerful wind moving in a single direction.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components.\nIt was recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki.\nThe Red Wizards of Thay created an arcane version of this spell that also required no material components."
