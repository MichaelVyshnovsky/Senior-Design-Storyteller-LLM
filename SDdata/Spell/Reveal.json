        "mainbody": "Reveal was a divine divination spell used by priests devoted to Tempus, enabling them to clearly see magical writings.\nThis spell revealed the locations of symbols, glyphs of warding, and all magically concealed inscriptions. The spell also showed the locations of active and inactive gates.\nThe reverse of this spell, conceal, had the opposite effect to a target to which the ointment was applied.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a special ointment to cast. The ointment was composed of four drops of wine, two drops of water, two drops of giant squid sepia, a pinch of powdered eyebright, and a powdered blue sapphire worth at least 1,000 gold pieces. The ointment for the conceal spell was composed of a pinch of powdered monkshood, six drops of onion juice, a pinch of dust, and seven drops of water.\nReveal was one of several spells included in the The Red Book of War, a book of spells and prayers dedicated to the Tempus."
