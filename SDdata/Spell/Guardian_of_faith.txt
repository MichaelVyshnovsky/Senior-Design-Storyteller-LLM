Guardian of faith was a divine conjuration spell that summoned a spectral guardian that prevented hostile creatures from approaching it.
The spell created a large indistinct guardian that could be identified only by the presence of the symbol of its casters deity on its shield. It lasted for eight hours and damaged any hostile creature that approached it. The guardian could be damaged and even destroyed if attacked with sufficient power.
The spell needed only a verbal component to be cast.
