        "Effects": "When cast, this spell modified the area of an enclosed space. Since the spell was [[Elemental earth school|Earth]]-based, the enclosed area had to be surrounded by rock, [[sand]], or soil. For the spell to be successful, the caster first had to cast ''[[conjure elemental]]'' to summon an [[earth elemental]]. The caster then must announce their intention to cast an ''distance distortion'' spell to the newly summoned earth elemental, to prevent the earth elemental from fighting the caster or attempting to break its summoning. \n\nThe spell used the earth elemental to increase or decrease, depending on the needs of the caster, the area of the targeted enclosed space. The magically modified area was not detectable by mundane means but a ''[[true seeing]]'' spell was able to detect the faint magical aura radiating from the modified space. Once the spell was completed, the earth elemental returned to its [[Elemental Plane of Earth|home plane]].",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], a small amount of soft [[clay]].",
        "History": "''Distance distortion'' was invented in {{Yearlink|-519}} by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Fjord (arcanist)|Fjord]] with the name ''Fjord's distortion''.<ref name=NEoM2e-p23,28\" />"
