Resist energy drain was an abjuration spell that protected any person or creature from the life-draining effects that accompanied the touch or attack of certain undead creatures.
Upon touch, the caster conferred protection from a single instance of energy-drain, so long as the source of that drain was an attack by undead creature. It did not protect against spells or abilities that mimicked this effect.
This spell required verbal and somatic components.
