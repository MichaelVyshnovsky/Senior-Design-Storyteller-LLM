'''''Resist energy drain''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that protected any person or creature from the life-draining effects that accompanied the touch or attack of certain [[undead]] creatures.

==Effects==
Upon touch, the caster conferred protection from a single instance of energy-drain, so long as the source of that drain was an attack by undead creature. It did not protect against spells or abilities that mimicked this effect.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
