Nurture was a divine enchantment and illusion spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Hathor called Revered Mothers.
Revered Mothers casting this spell assumed the role of surrogate mother to any infant animal, human, demihuman, or humanoid. Once under the influence of this spell the subject would view the caster as its mother for the rest of its life. The caster was able to nourish the subject with a mixture of milk and water, regardless of the subjects nature. This form of nourishment lasted until the subject reached maturity.
Animal subjects would view the caster as if under the influence of an animal friendship spell. It was very easy for the caster to train the subject for appropriate skills as well.
Hathor did not grant this spell to a Reverend Mother who already had enough parental responsibility. Furthermore, if the caster abused the relationship with the subject they they were striped of their divine powers and the enchantment effect would be transferred from the caster to the nearest Reverend Mother.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a baby rattle to cast.
