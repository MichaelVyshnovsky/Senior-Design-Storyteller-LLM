Mulch was a divine alteration and necromancy spell used by priests devoted to Silvanus, enabling them to cause wood to instantly rot away.
This spell caused wood or organic matter to instantly rot away. Priests of Silvanus exercised extreme care when using this spell. Mulch could be used for a variety of effects such as causing armor to fall off of a foe, to break bonds, etc. Wreckless use of this spell would damage vast amounts of nature. The spell was extremely harmful when used against plant-based creatures as well.
If used against non-plant-based living creatures, the spell caused moisture to withdraw deep within their bodies. This caused no physical harm but did alter the victims voice and made them appear much older.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
