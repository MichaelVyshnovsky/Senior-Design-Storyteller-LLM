        "mainbody": "'''''Living undeath''''' was a [[divine]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] from the second circle of magic that partially transformed the target into [[undead]].",
        "Effects": "With a touch, a [[cleric]] could transform a target's physical body into that of undead without truly making them a walking corpse. The target remained living, but their vital processes and body functions were temporarily suspended, rendering them unaffected by sneaky strikes and not receiving grave damage from lucky, well-aimed attacks. The effects of the spell lasted longer, the stronger the caster's magic was; however, the target lost their appearance and charisma for the time being. Those creatures of great fortitude could shrug the spell's effects off if the transformation was unwilling.",
        "Components": "The spell required only a [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s."
