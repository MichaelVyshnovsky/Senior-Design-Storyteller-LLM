        "mainbody": "Living undeath was a divine necromancy spell from the second circle of magic that partially transformed the target into undead.\nWith a touch, a cleric could transform a targets physical body into that of undead without truly making them a walking corpse. The target remained living, but their vital processes and body functions were temporarily suspended, rendering them unaffected by sneaky strikes and not receiving grave damage from lucky, well-aimed attacks. The effects of the spell lasted longer, the stronger the casters magic was however, the target lost their appearance and charisma for the time being. Those creatures of great fortitude could shrug the spells effects off if the transformation was unwilling.\nThe spell required only a somatic and verbal components."
