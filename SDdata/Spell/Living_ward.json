        "mainbody": "Living ward was a spell commonly used by evil clerics on the Domains of Dread.\nThis spell was the reverse of undead ward. When cast, this spell created a zone in which a living individual was unable to enter. The zone was cube-shaped, with a minimum length of  per side, which increased with the casters skill level. Animals and monsters were able to pass through the zone with no issue. If a living individual was within the area of effect when the spell was cast, they were unaffected. However, if they left the area of effect, they were unable to return within. The spell was often used by undead sentient creatures.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components."
