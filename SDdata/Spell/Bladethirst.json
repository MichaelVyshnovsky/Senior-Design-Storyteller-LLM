        "mainbody": "Bladethirst was an alteration spell that greatly increased the accuracy of any slashing weapon designated by the caster. It could be found within the tome Sabirines Specular, the spellbook of the noted mage of the North, Sabirine.\nA weapon affected by bladethirst began to glow with a blue-white fire.\nUpon the spells casting, any single-bladed slashing weapon was granted a +3 enchantment, cumulative with any existing magical enhancement, allowing its wielder to strike with greater precision. It did not however increase the skill of the wielder, nor did it make their slashing attacks any more damaging.\nOnly one casting of the spell could affect a weapon at one time, and the effects could not be affected by the spell permanency.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and material components, the latter being a single drop of blood and a small pinch of silver powder."
