More than a powerful form of [[undead]], a '''dracolich''' was a [[dragon]] who had voluntarily tied its soul to a [[phylactery]], freeing itself from death. A type of [[lich]], the creature's spirit could possess any dead reptilian body, usually their original form, and retained all the powers and abilities of the former body. That meant a dracolich had the  supernatural fear aura, spells, and breath weapon it had in life, plus the terrible might of the undead.

==Powers==
A dracolich had the strange ability to inhabit the body of any reptilian corpse upon death, though they were at their most powerful when inhabiting the corpse of a [[dragon]]. When killed in its corporeal body, the dracolich didn't "die". Instead, its spirit fled and hid in the phylactery, awaiting another suitable body to animate and inhabit.<ref> Like other types of lich, a dracolich was only truly annihilated when its [[phylactery]] was destroyed.

==History==
The process of becoming a dracolich was discovered by [[Sammaster|Sammaster the Mad]], a fallen [[Chosen of Mystra]], who was inspired after re-translating ''[[The Chronicle of Years to Come]]'' by the prophet [[Maglas]]. He was convinced that [[Toril]] would suffer a great apocalypse and "naught will be left save shattered thrones with no rulers. But the dead dragons shall rule the world entire&hellip;" Sammaster's first success was with the great red [[wyrm]] [[Shargrailar|Shargrailar the Dark]] in the {{YearlinkName|902}}. Since then, Sammaster and his followers, the [[Cult of the Dragon]], created many more, preparing for the apocalypse they "knew" would come."

After his destruction in the {{YearlinkName|916}}, Sammaster somehow resurrected himself on the far-off world of [[Adenthia]], where he hoped to use necromancy and chaos power, a local form of magic, to achieve a chaotic state between life and death without the need for a phylactery for himself and his newly created dracoliches. Sammaster acquired the assistance of a local cult, Penultima, which he turned into a kind of Cult of the Dragon cell. However, their new dracoliches were weakened and prone to madness, rage, and spontaneous disintegration. [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] sent [[Elminster]] to Adenthia to investigate the "diminished" dracoliches terrorizing its southern lands; Elminster suspected that world's chaos power was infecting her own magic. Elminster enlisted the aid of a local adventurer, [[Gerana]], and they tracked the dracoliches to the cult's fortress, where they destroyed Sammaster again and ended the threat of dracoliches on Adenthia.
