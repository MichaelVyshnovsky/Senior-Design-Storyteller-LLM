        "mainbody": "'''''Deep breath''''' was a [[spell]] that filled a creature's lungs with air and allowed them to hold their breath for a supernatural length of time.",
        "Effects": "The spell had two forms. The older version allowed the caster to touch a creature and imbue them with the ability to inhale a magically huge amount of air that could sustain them for minutes, or to fill their lungs with such an amount of air if they were already holding their breath.&mdash;would only fill one's own lungs with air, but then would continue to refill them with [[Conjuration|conjured]] air for a short time. In either case, the recipient of the spell had no need to breathe for the spell's duration (which was determined by the experience of the caster). This prevented suffocation and provided defense against most mundane and [[magic]]al gasses. The spell did not impart any additional ability to move or navigate in environments without air.\n\nThe spell could also be used to counter castings of ''steal breath''.",
        "Components": "The older variant of the spell had a short [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]], and required a small animal [[bladder]] filled with air as a [[material component]]. This bladder was popped over the mouth of the spell's recipient.\n\nThe newer variant of the spell required only a quick verbal utterance, allowing it to be cast almost instantaneously.",
        "History": "It was rare to encounter the ''deep breath'' spell on [[Toril]], although it was more common on [[Athas]].\n\nIn the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the material components for this spell could be purchased from places like [[Aurora's Emporium]] for 5 [[copper piece]]s per bladder."
