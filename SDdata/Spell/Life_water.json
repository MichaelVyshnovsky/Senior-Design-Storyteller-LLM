        "mainbody": "Life water was a spell used by wizards in Anauroch and Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis wondrous spell transformed any liquid into a magical serum capable of healing wounds, curing blindness, disease, poison, rot, feeblemindedness, etc. Severed limbs could be regenerated after applying the liquid. This serum could not bring life back to a dead body and it could not revert a transformed creature back to its original form.\nA gallon (3.79 l) of this serum completely cured a man-sized creature. A water skin of this serum would cure only one ailment. The serum was applied to the skin and absorbed where its healing effects took place.\nThis spell required any liquid to cast."
