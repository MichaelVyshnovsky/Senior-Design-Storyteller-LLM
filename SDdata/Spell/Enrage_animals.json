        "mainbody": "'''''Enrage animals''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that instilled uncontrolled rage into an [[animal]].",
        "Effects": "On casting ''enrage animals'', the caster chose an area and animals within this area were then affected. These animals grew highly aggressive and started attacking whatever creature was nearest; it was entirely possible for an affected animal to attack another affected animal that happened to be nearby. It was very easy to provoke such behavior from a normal wild animal, but a [[dire animal]] and/or one that underwent training to attack on order was hard to enchant with this spell and it was possible for such animals to resist the spell.",
        "Components": "''Enrage animals'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s."
