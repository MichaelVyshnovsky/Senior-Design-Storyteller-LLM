        "mainbody": "Power word, liquefy, was a powerful spell from the conjuration school that could be wielded only by wizards.\nUpon casting this powerful spell, one or more creatures in a chosen area were instantly turned to water. \nThe spell only worked on one creature with weak health or several with a very small degree of health. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The chosen area had to be close to the spellcaster. If the spell was cast underwater, the volume of all creatures liquefied caused no displacement and the liquid dispersed with time. The estimated volume of all creatures acted as normal fluid. Creatures affected were forever slain and could only be reÂ­stored by a wish or an act of the gods.\nThe spell required only a verbal component, which was the uttering of the power word itself. \nThe spell could only be wielded by wizards. It was considered a very rare spell."
