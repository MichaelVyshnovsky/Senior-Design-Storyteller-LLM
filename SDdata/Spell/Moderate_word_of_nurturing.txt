'''''Moderate word of nurturing''''' was an [[utterance]] from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind that used [[truespeak]] to rejuvenate a target from its wounds, or to rend them apart, if reversed.

==Usage==
In its normal form, healing energy suffused the target, slowly repairing them of a great amount of damage. In its reversed form, it rended and tore at the target's being, dealing severe wounds. It could last for an instant, but with some concentration, damage would be doubled after a few seconds.

==History==
The utterance was known to [[painspeaker]]s, who used only the reversed form, and to [[loquasphinx]]es.{{cite book/Tome of Magic 3.5|269-270}}
