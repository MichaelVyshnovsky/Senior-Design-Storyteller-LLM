        "mainbody": "'''''Levitate''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] or [[supernatural]] ability that allowed the caster to move a creature or object vertically as desired.",
        "Effects": "The caster could choose to levitate him- or herself or a creature or object within a close range. The weight of the creature or object lifted depended on the power of the caster but at a minimum, the spell could lift anything under {{SI|200|lb|long=yes}}. Only a willing creature could be lifted. Levitated persons or objects could be moved mentally at a speed of {{SIspeed|200|ft|min|k|min|long=yes}}, but only in the up or down direction.\n\nIt was difficult to maintain one's balance if attempting to engage in combat while levitating. \n\nThe effects of this spell lasted for several minutes, depending on the power of the caster.",
        "Components": "Proper casting of this spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s and the use of a [[spell focus]]. The focus could be either a piece of [[gold]]en [[wire]] shaped into the form of a small [[cup]] with a shank or a small loop of [[leather]].",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Yturn]] in {{Yearlink|-1160}} and was originally called ''Yturn's levitation''.",
        "Users": "Some races native to [[Faer√ªn]], such as the [[air genasi]] and the [[drow]] (while in the [[Underdark]]), had the innate ability to levitate.\n\nDuring the religious ceremony of the [[Dance of the Swirling Winds]], the [[Elf|elven]] goddess [[Aerdrie Faenya]] would sometimes grant her worshipers who could not fly the power to levitate.\n\nLevitation played a key role in the [[drow]] game [[khaless]]."
