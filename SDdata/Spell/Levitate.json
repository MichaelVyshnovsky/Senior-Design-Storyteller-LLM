The weight of the creature or object lifted depended on the power of the caster but at a minimum, the spell could lift anything under . Only a willing creature could be lifted. Levitated persons or objects could be moved mentally at a speed of , but only in the up or down direction.\nIt was difficult to maintain ones balance if attempting to engage in combat while levitating. \nThe effects of this spell lasted for several minutes, depending on the power of the caster.\nProper casting of this spell required verbal and somatic components and the use of a spell focus. The focus could be either a piece of golden wire shaped into the form of a small cup with a shank or a small loop of leather.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Yturn in  and was originally called Yturns levitation.\nSome races native to Faer√ªn, such as the air genasi and the drow (while in the Underdark), had the innate ability to levitate.\nDuring the religious ceremony of the Dance of the Swirling Winds, the elven goddess Aerdrie Faenya would sometimes grant her worshipers who could not fly the power to levitate.\nLevitation played a key role in the drow game khaless."
