Commune with nature was a divination spell that allowed the caster to learn about the surrounding terrain for a few miles/kilometers. The more advanced the caster, the further the effect.
This spell attuned the caster with the natural surroundings, extending outward for a few miles/kilometers in all directions. From this, knowledge could be gleaned about the terrain, plant life, mineral deposits, bodies of water, buildings, animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of unnatural creatures, presence of people, and the general health of the region. Older versions of this spell allowed more facts to be learned, but they were more narrowly limited.
The range of this spell depended on the power of the caster, but was quite limited underground, compared to casting the spell outdoors. Buildings appeared as blank areas in the casters vision because the spell did not function where nature had been replaced by construction or settlement (such as in dungeons and towns).
The post sundering vertion of the spell was restricted in size to 3 miles above ground and 300 feet below ground. Other then this the spell functions as before.
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.
