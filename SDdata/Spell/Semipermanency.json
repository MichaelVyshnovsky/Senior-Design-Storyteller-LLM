        "mainbody": "'''''Semipermanency''''' was a [[spell]] that allowed a caster to increase the duration of other spells.",
        "Effects": "The caster first cast the spell they wished to increase the duration of, followed by casting this spell. Like the more powerful ''permanency'' spell, this spell was able to increase the duration of spells cast upon the caster themselves. The spell was also able to increase the duration of spells that had an effect on areas, creatures or items. The spell was vulnerable to ''[[dispel magic]]''. A caster was unable to use this spell to bestow increased duration during the creation of an enchanted or magical item.",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required [[material component]]s, a small [[anvil]] made from metal that was worth at least 50 [[gp]], and a single drop of blood from a [[dwarf]].",
        "History": "This spell was known to be used by wizards of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]."
