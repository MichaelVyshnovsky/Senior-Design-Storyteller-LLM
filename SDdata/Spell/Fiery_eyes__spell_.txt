'''''Fiery eyes''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell illuminated a wu jen's eyes. This allowed the caster to provide light up to a range of 3 feet (1 meter). By staring at a combustible material or object, the wu jen was able to create a small fire. The wu jen was able to control the color of the light.

Any creature who looked at the wu jen during this spell was susceptible to distraction, and it was often used alongside ''[[Hypnotism|hypnosis]]'', ''[[hypnotic pattern]]'', or ''[[mass suggestion]]'' spells.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
