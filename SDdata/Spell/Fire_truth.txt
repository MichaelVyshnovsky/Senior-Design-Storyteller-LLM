}}'''''Fire truth''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
This spell was used to determine if someone was speaking the truth. The target was questioned by the wizard and spoke into a special candle while it was lit. Half-truths or slight deceptions caused the flame to gutter; a lie extinguished the flame. This spell lasted for ten questions or until the candle was extinguished by a lie. If the target believed what they were saying was the truth then the candle read this as truth, even if it was false information.

==Components==
This spell required a [[candle]] made from a rare desert [[bee]]'s [[beeswax|wax]] that cost 300 [[gold piece]]s.
