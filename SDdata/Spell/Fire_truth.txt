Fire truth was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by wizards.
This spell was used to determine if someone was speaking the truth. The target was questioned by the wizard and spoke into a special candle while it was lit. Half-truths or slight deceptions caused the flame to gutter a lie extinguished the flame. This spell lasted for ten questions or until the candle was extinguished by a lie. If the target believed what they were saying was the truth then the candle read this as truth, even if it was false information.
This spell required a candle made from a rare desert bees wax that cost 300 gold pieces.
