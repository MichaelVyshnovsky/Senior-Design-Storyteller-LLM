Forests fiery constrictor was a conjuration spell used by wizards. This spell was developed by Forest.
This spell caused a tentacle of flame to shoot forth from any source of natural or magical fire. The fiery tentacle measured  long. Enchanted weapons were needed to harm it. The caster could direct the flaming tentacle to attack any target within . Creatures struck by the tentacle were burned, but if the tentacle was able to wrap around them they would continue to burn until the spell expired.
Extinguishing the source of fire feeding the tentacle would cut the spell duration in half.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a scale from a red dragon to cast. 
In the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast Forests fiery constrictor within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.
