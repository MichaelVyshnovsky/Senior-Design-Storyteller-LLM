        "mainbody": "Gift of life was an Elven High Magic wizard spell that restored undead to life.\nUnwilling undead targets could resist the spells effects but found it was very difficult to do so. A target would be restored to life just how it was right before it died. If the target died of natural causes, then the spell restored it to life as it was ten years before its death. The restoration was shocking for the target, leaving them stunned for nearly an hour as they slowly realized what just occurred.\nThough the restored target would still be wearing the same clothing and carrying the same gear that they were before the spell was cast, the abilities and skills they possessed were appropriate for how they were in life before their death. The new chance at life sometimes prompted wicked undead, such as vampires or liches, to repent from their old way to lead good lives.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a gold medallion shaped like the sun to cast."
