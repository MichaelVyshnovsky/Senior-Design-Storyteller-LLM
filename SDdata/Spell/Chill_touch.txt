'''''Chill touch''''', formerly known as '''''Veridon's chiller''''', was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that disrupted the life force of the living. The spell was intended to allow the caster to harm a foe with the same deathly cold hands as a [[lich]].

==Users==
''Chill touch'' could be cast by [[sorcerer]]s, [[wizard]]s, and [[cleric]]s who commanded the [[cold domain]] In the time of [[Netheril]], it could be cast by [[arcanist]]s of the Inventive and Variation specializations.

==Effects==
The caster's hand glowed blue and a touch from it channeled [[negative energy]] into a victim, disrupting their life force. It could also possibly weaken the target's muscles, draining their strength, though this effect could be resisted. 

The spell had a special effect on [[undead]] creatures. Undead touched suffered no damage or strength loss, but they could flee in terror for a short time if the spell overcame their will.

The sundering version of the spell created a ghostly skeleton hand around a creature. The hand could by will of the caster attack the creature with necrotic energy and shortly hindering its ability to regain health as it clung on to it. A undead creature struck by the hand would have disadvantage on its attacks against the caster.

==Components==
Some versions of the spell called for the powdered bone of a lich.

==History==
The [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Veridon]], ruler of [[Lathery]], was given the credit for the creation of this spell. He introduced it in [[-463 DR|3396 NY (−463 DR)]] under the name ''Veridon's chiller''. It later became known simply as ''chill touch''.

''Chill touch'' was a rare spell in [[Faerûn]] in the 1360s [[DR]].
