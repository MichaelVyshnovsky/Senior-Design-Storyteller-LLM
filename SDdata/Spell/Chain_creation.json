        "mainbody": "Chain creation was a divine evocation spell that multiplied the effects of certain spells.\nThe effects of this spell only took hold when cast within ten minutes of the casting of minor creation or a divine spell from the creation sphere. It failed if cast under other circumstances or if it affected anything to do with the undead.\nWhen it was cast, chain creation functioned as three duplicate castings of the previously-cast spell. The duplicated effects were permanent in nature, as were any objects created by their casting.\nThis spell was inscribed within the holy relic called the Tome of the Morning.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required three rubies worth at least 100 gp or the dust taken from four such rubies."
