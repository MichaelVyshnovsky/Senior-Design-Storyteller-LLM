        "mainbody": "Epic gate was a conjuration spell of epic magic, granted to or developed and used by some of the most powerful arcane scholars of Candlekeep, arcane tricksters, bards, clerics, druids, eldritch knights, favored souls, Harper agents, pale masters, Red Wizards, sacred fists, sorcerers, spirit shamans, stormlords, warlocks, warpriests, and wizards, who were masters of spellcraft and could access the 9 circle of magic.\nWith the spells utterance, a gate to the lower planes opened, summoning a balor forth. The sheer power of the spellcaster was such that the summoned balor was under their full control without a need to cast protection from evil or similar spells. The summoning lasted for four full minutes with the balor disappearing afterwards. If the summoned balor was killed, another one took its place immediately.\nTo cast epic gate, the caster had to use verbal and somatic components."
