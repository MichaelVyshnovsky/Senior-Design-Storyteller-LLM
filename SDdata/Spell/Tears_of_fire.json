        "Effects": "This spell created 2-5 spheres of fire. Each sphere measured roughly {{SI|6|in|long=yes}} in diameter. The fire spheres followed the caster for the duration of the spell by circling around their head. These spheres radiated the same amount of illumination as a ''[[light]]'' spell and gave off the heat of a regular fire, making them capable of providing warmth and comfort for the caster and anyone close to them.\n\nThe fire spheres moved about the caster without their concentration, leaving them free to cast other spells or perform similar actions unhindered.\n\nWith a mere thought the caster could send any or all of the spheres to unerringly strike any visible foe, so long as they were within {{SI|20|yards|long=yes}}, burning them with flame. When struck with a sphere, combustible garments or items also burst into flame. The caster could direct the spheres at a single target or multiple targets at the same time.\n\nIf the caster chose to send only a single sphere at a target, they were able to simultaneously perform other actions such as spellcasting. Sending more than one sphere to attack required the caster's full attention.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, ''tears of fire'' required a small [[candle]] that was made from [[perfume]]d [[beeswax]] worth at least 100 [[gold piece]]s to cast. The candle was lit and consumed during casting."
