The caster had to request that their [[deity]] to send the spirit of an [[outsider]]. The specific spirit was determined by the deity, not the caster. \n\nThe animated corpse attacked the opponents of the caster. If the caster was capable of communicating with the spirit, they were able to instruct in a limited fashion. Some traits of the outsider persisted in the corpse, such as intelligence. The spirit also had access to the innate natural abilities of the corpse. However, the spirit was not able to use any innate spell-casting abilities or effects that the corpse would possess if alive.\n\nOnce the spell expired or the corpse was destroyed, the spirit returned safely to their origin.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a [[divine focus]] and a sacrifice of the caster's strength."
