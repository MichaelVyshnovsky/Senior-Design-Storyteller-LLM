        "mainbody": "'''''Dancing blade''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell animated any normal sword or dagger. It would hover in the air and defend the caster or a creature designated by the caster. The spell could not be cast on a blade in possession of a creature. The spell only worked if the individual it was defending was able to wield it normally, so a [[halfling]] was unable to be defended with a [[broadsword]].\n\nThe blade would not travel farther than 5 feet (1.5 meters) from the individual. If the individual was killed, the spell would expire, causing the blade to fall to the ground. During the spell, the blade acted independently and did not require the concentration of the caster.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a small puppet made of sticks."
