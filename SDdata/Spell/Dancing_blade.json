        "mainbody": "Dancing blade was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the spell animated any normal sword or dagger. It would hover in the air and defend the caster or a creature designated by the caster. The spell could not be cast on a blade in possession of a creature. The spell only worked if the individual it was defending was able to wield it normally, so a halfling was unable to be defended with a broadsword.\nThe blade would not travel farther than 5 feet (1.5 meters) from the individual. If the individual was killed, the spell would expire, causing the blade to fall to the ground. During the spell, the blade acted independently and did not require the concentration of the caster.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small puppet made of sticks."
