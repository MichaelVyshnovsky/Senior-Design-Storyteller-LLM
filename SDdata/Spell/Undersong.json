        "mainbody": "Undersong was a bardic transmutation spell that conjured a soothing and familiar tune within the mind of the caster.\nAs long as the bard kept this song in their head, and hummed along with the melody, they experienced a sensation of focused concentration. Its effects lasted for a matter of minutes, depending on their experience and skill as a performer.\nThis spell only required verbal utterances to cast.\nTvash-Prull developed spells for bards. In his one and only symphony he magically embedded this and other spells in the sheet music for it to be discovered by bardic spellcasters who had the ability to detect and decipher the spells."
