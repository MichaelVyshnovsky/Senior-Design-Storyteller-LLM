        "mainbody": "'''''Stone bones''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell transformed the bones of an [[undead]] creature to become stronger and thicker. As a result, their bones were as strong as stone. The spell also worked on undead creatures that had an exoskeleton.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required an [[arcane focus]], a small [[granite]] skull.",
        "History": "It was rumored another version of this spell existed, with the same effects but used on living creatures. It likely caused tremendous pain to the targeted creature and it was probable that the clerics of [[Loviatar]] used this spell."
