Coral burn was a spell that was a variation of the heat metal spell.
When cast, this spell began to heat up any exposed coral within  from the caster. Any living coral was subsequently killed and the spell injured Dukar within the area of effect.
Immediately after the spell was cast, the coral became comfortably warm. However, it gradually increased in temperature, eventually becoming so hot it inflicted severe burns.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component.
