'''''Tyranteyes''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the schools of [[alteration]], [[evocation]] and [[necromancy]].

==Usage==
This spell allowed the caster to transform into a [[beholder]] for the duration of the spell or until they wished the transformation to end. The caster was transported to an extradimensional space for one minute while their beholder body formed. The caster could cast a single spell during this time, typically a defensive one.

The caster's regular body remained within the extradimensional space, but their beholder form reappeared in the same place where they stood when the spell was cast. If slain while in beholder form, the caster would remain dead unless a ''[[contingency]]'' was in effect to transport them back to their normal body.

The caster could perform all normal beholder functions while in that form. Any physical harm suffered as a beholder was not transferred to the caster's regular body so long as they exited the beholder body before it was killed.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]] a piece of a once-living beholder to cast.
