'''''Stealspell''''' was a powerful rare [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that snatched a single spell from a target spellcaster's memory.

==Effects==
If the target of this spell was unable to resist the spell's magic, a single random spell was stolen from their mind. ''Stealspell'' could penetrate all magical defensive barriers save for an ''[[anti-magic shell]]''. This spell would fail if used upon a spellcaster who did not have any spells memorized.

The caster who received the stolen spell could either cast the spell immediately, or retain it within their memory for up to 24 hours. The caster need not be familiar with, or even be able to cast the spell under normal circumstances if it was beyond their skill, in order to cast the stolen spell.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. However, if the stolen spell required [[material component]]s to cast, those materials were automatically used from the supplies of the individual from whom the spell was stolen.

==History==
This spell originated with the [[wychlaran]] of [[Rashemen]].
