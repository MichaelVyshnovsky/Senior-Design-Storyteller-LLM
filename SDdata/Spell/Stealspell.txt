Stealspell was a powerful rare arcane enchantment spell that snatched a single spell from a target spellcasters memory.
If the target of this spell was unable to resist the spells magic, a single random spell was stolen from their mind. Stealspell could penetrate all magical defensive barriers save for an anti-magic shell. This spell would fail if used upon a spellcaster who did not have any spells memorized.
The caster who received the stolen spell could either cast the spell immediately, or retain it within their memory for up to 24 hours. The caster need not be familiar with, or even be able to cast the spell under normal circumstances if it was beyond their skill, in order to cast the stolen spell.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast. However, if the stolen spell required material components to cast, those materials were automatically used from the supplies of the individual from whom the spell was stolen.
This spell originated with the wychlaran of Rashemen.
