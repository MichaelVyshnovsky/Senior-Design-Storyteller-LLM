        "mainbody": "Fire eyes was a wizard spell from the school of alteration.\nThis spell allowed the caster to emit rays of fire from their eyes. The heat produced from these concentrated rays was intense enough to burn holes through plate armor. If used during combat the caster could normally strike at two different targets at a time. However, if directed down a narrow corridor or other such situation, the caster could attack multiple targets at once.\nThe caster was unable to cast any other spells while fire eyes was active, but they could end the spell at any time. The caster could also temporarily interrupt the rays in order to look upon things without burning them.\nWhile using this spell the caster was immune to all direct fire and heat-related damage, including even dragon breath.\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast.\nHigh-ranking dwarven priests of Gorm Gulthyn were typically known to have this spell bestowed upon them."
