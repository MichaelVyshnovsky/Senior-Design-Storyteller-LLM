        "mainbody": "Shroud of undeath was an necromancy spell used by wizards and sorcerers.\nThis spell cloaked the caster in negative energy, making them appear undead to other undead. The casters appearance remained the same which would probably prompt questioning from intelligent undead such as vampires or liches. The spell would end immediately if the caster attacked an undead creature.\nWhile under the effects of shroud of undeath, the caster experienced the opposite effects of healing or curse spells. For example, healing spells would harm them and curse spells would heal them.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required dust or bone fragments from a destroyed undead creature to cast. The caster was also susceptible to other things typically meant to harm or effect undead such as holy water and turning."
