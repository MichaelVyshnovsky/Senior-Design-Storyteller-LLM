==Effects==
When cast, the targeted creature was completely transformed. Not only was their physical appearance altered, but their abilities, intelligence, personality and skills as well. The targeted creature could only be transformed into another creature, the caster was unable to use this spell to transform an individual into an object or a plant nor a non-corporeal form. The transformation was a shock on the target's system, there was a chance the targeted creature was killed by the spell. If killed while the spell was in effect, the targeted creature reverted to their natural form. Any equipment in the physical possession of a targeted creature was melded into their new form.

Once transformed, the targeted creature acquired not only the physical form but also the abilities of their new body. There were some limits. If transformed into a form whose natural abilities included innate magical abilities, the polymorphed creature did not inherit these abilities. If a [[doppelganger]], [[druid]], [[lycanthrope]] or other natural shapeshifters were targeted with this spell, the effect of the spell was limited and their form was transformed for only a very short period of time.

If the polymorphed individual lost their original mentality and personality and fully adapted the mentality of their new form, they effectively became their new form, even acquiring any innate magical abilities. The only way to reverse this was if a ''[[wish]]'' spell was cast upon them. If the polymorphed individual only lost their individuality to their new form, a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell would revert their physical form to their original form but they still retained the individuality of their polymorphed form. For example, if a [[human]] who was polymorphed into a [[copper dragon]] came to believe fully they were indeed a copper dragon, after returning to their human form, they now believed they were a copper dragon who has been polymorphed into a human.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], the cocoon of a caterpillar. The spell cast by [[wu jen]] used the wings of a moth wrapped in a piece of [[silk]].

==History==
This spell was invented in {{Yearlink|-2017}} by [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Quantoul]]. It was the last spell he developed and was originally called ''Quantoul's othermorph''., ''[[Bowgentle's Book]]'' and the ''[[Tome of the Unicorn]]''.
