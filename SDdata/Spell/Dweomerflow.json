They could then have been gradually released by someone of the same faith to which the site was sanctified. More powerful spells required a casting of ''[[abeyance]]'' in addition to ''dweomerflow''.\n\nMany holy sites scattered across [[Faer√ªn]] were well-protected by powerful offensive spells that were released if they were intruded upon by the faithless. This magic was often stored within a ''[[holy symbol]]'' that was doubtlessly present at the divine location. To bypass these spell effects, a [[cold iron]] tool could be used to remove the symbol, circumventing the effects of ''dweomerflow''."
