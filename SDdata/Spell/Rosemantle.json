For a short time (depending on the level of the caster), the target gained the blessing of increased resistance to fear (such as a ''[[fear]]'' spell or a [[dragon]]'s aura), sickness and nausea (such as the odor of a [[ghast]] or the moan of a [[cloaker]]), or pain (such as caused by ''[[Nybor's gentle reminder]]'').",
