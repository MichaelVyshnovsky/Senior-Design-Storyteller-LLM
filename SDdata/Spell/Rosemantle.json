        "mainbody": "Rosemantle was a divine magic spell available to priests of Lathander, the Morninglord. It increased a creatures resistance to adverse effects such as fear, nausea, pain, or sickness.\nThe caster had to touch the creature that was the target of this spell. When cast, the recipient of rosemantle gave off a soft glow resembling candlelight. For a short time (depending on the level of the caster), the target gained the blessing of increased resistance to fear (such as a fear spell or a dragons aura), sickness and nausea (such as the odor of a ghast or the moan of a cloaker), or pain (such as caused by Nybors gentle reminder).\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
