        "mainbody": "'''''Wolfsong''''' was a [[bard]]ic [[spell]] that lured all [[wolves]] in the area to the caster. It was created by [[Harkon Lukas]], the Darklord of [[Kartakass]].",
        "Effects": "''Wolfsong'' was effectively a song infused with bardic magic. The spellcaster performed a sinister, ululating song that could be heard all across an area of up to {{SI|1|mile|k|long=yes}} around the bard. The wailing melody was carried through [[magic]], enthralling all wolves and [[dire wolves]] who heard it and could not resist its compulsion. The wolves affected by this song howled back at the caster and immediately moved toward the bard, arriving within one to four minutes. The magical compulsion ended once the wolves reached the source of the ''wolfsong'' or faced an impregnable obstacle in their way. The spell had no limit to how many wolves and dire wolves it could affect. The ''wolfsong'' spell could also penetrate the sinister mists of the [[Domains of Dread]]. One important distinction between this spell and a ''[[summoning]]'' was the fact that the beckoned wolves were not under the caster's control.",
        "Components": "''Wolfsong'' required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to be cast. The radius a ''wolfsong'' traveled increased by a single mile per circle of magic used for the casting.",
        "History": "''Wolfsong'' was invented by Harkon Lukas, the [[wolfwere]] Darklord of Kartakass, who hailed from [[Cormyr]]. He often taught the spell to the bards he found troublesome, never revealing to them that the summoned wolves were not actually under the caster's control."
