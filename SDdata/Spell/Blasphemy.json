        "mainbody": "Blasphemy was an evocation spell that could incapacitate or even kill non-evil creatures and banish those of extraplanar origin.\nThis spell compared the targets toughness or experience level with the experience level of the caster and had no effect on creatures that were superior to the caster, but the effects were increasingly severe and cumulative for those equal to or inferior. The only way to avoid these effects was to not hear the blasphemy, either by virtue of already being deaf, or some form of magical silence.\nIn addition to the effects described below, this spell could send extraplanar creatures back to their home plane, as long as the blasphemy was spoken on the casters home plane. This affected all weak-willed nonevil creatures, thus allowing it to banish those of a neutral alignment as well. This dismissal happened even if the creatures in the area of effect could not hear the blasphemy, and any banished creatures were blocked from returning to the casters home plane for at least 24 hours.\nThe area of effect was a circle of 40 ft (12.2 m) radius centered on the caster. Upon completion of casting, all non-good creatures equal to or inferior to the caster suffered one or more of the following cumulatively\nThis spell only required a verbal component to cast."
