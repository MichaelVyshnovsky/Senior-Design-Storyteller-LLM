'''''Mordenkainen's involuntary wizardry''''' was a [[spell]] that forced a target spellcaster to produce the effects of a random known spell.

==Effects==
The spell could target any spellcasting creature within a range of 60 ft (18 m). One spell known to the target simply took effect, without requiring any action from the target, and without requiring the target to expend any components (although any necessary consumable components in the target's possession disappeared nonetheless). If the circumstances did not allow for a particular effect to happen, the spell caused damage to the target instead, proportionally to how powerful the random effect would have been.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components.

==History==
The [[Oerth]]ian [[wizard]] [[Mordenkainen]] introduced the spell to [[Elminster]] and [[Dalamar]] of [[Krynn]] during one of their meetings in the house of [[Ed of the Greenwood]] on [[Earth]].

By the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the spell was known in [[Faer√ªn]] as belonging to the [[incantation]] school of magic.
