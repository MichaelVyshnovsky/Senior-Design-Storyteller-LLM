        "mainbody": "Rapture was a divine enchantment spell used by priests devoted to Sune, enabling them to cause others to experience pure bliss.\nThe target of this spell experienced pure bliss, temporarily banishing all fear, pain, and other feelings. Rapture protected the target from any attack against their libido such as a sirens song. They were also immune to any attacks against their mind.\nThough rapture certainly carried plenty of benefits, the spell was so strong that it stood a chance of actually stunning the target with the state of bliss, causing them to simply stand motionless for the spells duration.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
