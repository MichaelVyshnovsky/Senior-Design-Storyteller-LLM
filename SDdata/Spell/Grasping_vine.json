        "mainbody": "Grasping vine was a conjuration spell that summoned a vine capable of pulling creatures toward it.\nThe spell caused a vine to sprout from the ground that could pull another creature directly towards it. The vine lasted for up to one minute, for as long as the caster concentrated, and could be commanded to pull other creatures.\nThe spell needed verbal and somatic components."
