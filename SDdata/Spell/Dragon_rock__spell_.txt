'''''Dragon rock''''' was a rare [[spell]] that permanently ransformed a large area of stone into air.

==Effects==
The area of stone turned into air only applied to [[dragon]]s, meaning a dragon could simply pass through such an area as if it were air while any other type of creature would interact with the same area as if it were solid rock.

==History==
The dragon [[Vulpomyscan]] used an area affected by the ''dragon rock'' spell to poke his head through "tunnels" within the [[Citadel of Black Ash]] and blast enemies with acid and retreat to safety without fear of retaliation.
