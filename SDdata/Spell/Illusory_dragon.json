        "mainbody": "Illusory dragon was a powerful spell that created an illusion of a dragon.\nThis spell created an illusion of a massive dragon. The illusion was life-like and creatures who saw the dragon were wracked with fear. The illusion was also capable of using a breath weapon that inflicted terrible damage. During casting, the caster chose which type of breath weapon the dragon used acid, fire, lightning, necrotic, or poison. The caster was able to move the illusion up to  in any direction. Magical and non-magical attacks had no effect on the illusion, and it was immune to damage from spells. \nAlthough this spell required only a somatic component, the caster had to draw shadow material from Shadowfell to cast it successfully."
