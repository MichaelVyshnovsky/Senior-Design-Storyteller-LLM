        "mainbody": "'''''Illusory dragon''''' was a powerful [[spell]] that created an [[illusion]] of a [[dragon]].",
        "Effects": "This spell created an illusion of a massive dragon. The illusion was life-like and creatures who saw the dragon were wracked with fear. The illusion was also capable of using a breath weapon that inflicted terrible damage. During casting, the caster chose which type of breath weapon the dragon used: acid, fire, lightning, necrotic, or poison. The caster was able to move the illusion up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} in any direction. Magical and non-magical attacks had no effect on the illusion, and it was immune to damage from spells.",
        "Components": "Although this spell required only a [[somatic component|somatic]] component, the caster had to draw shadow material from [[Shadowfell]] to cast it successfully."
