During casting, the caster chose which type of breath weapon the dragon used acid, fire, lightning, necrotic, or poison. The caster was able to move the illusion up to  in any direction. Magical and non-magical attacks had no effect on the illusion, and it was immune to damage from spells. \nAlthough this spell required only a somatic component, the caster had to draw shadow material from Shadowfell to cast it successfully."
