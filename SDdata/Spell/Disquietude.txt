Disquietude was a spell used by bards.
This spell took the form of either a poem or a song. If a creature heard it, they were overcome with an intense feeling of paranoia. This caused the inflicted creature to become anxious and avoid physical contact with those around them. If attacked, the paranoia caused them to flee.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
