Soul scour was a necromancy spell that allowed the caster to corrupt the soul of another living being on physical contact.
Upon casting the spell, the casters mere touch temporarily drained the essence of any living person or creature. After contact, the mental faculties and individualism of that person were drained from them over the course of a minute.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of a pinch of dust comprising the ground bones of a lich.
