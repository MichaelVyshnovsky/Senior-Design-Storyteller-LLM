'''''Consecrated ground''''' was a daily prayer available to [[cleric]]s during the post-[[Spellplague]] era that temporarily consecrated an area with [[radiant energy]].

==Effects==
Through prayer a cleric casting ''consecrated ground'' caused jagged and crackling lines of radiant light to spread across an area of ground of their choosing, moving in a web-like manner. ''Consecrated ground'' could be sustained by the caster and while active the area of effect could be moved to anywhere within {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} of the ground that was originally consecrated. Any enemy that stood within the area would be harmed by the radiant energy emanating from the ground, while any injured allies would be moderately healed.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1420}}, a party of four [[Daggerdale]]smen [[adventurer]]s were [[teleport|summoned]] to the [[mines of Tethyamar]] by the [[Banite]] priestess [[Lorin-Aria]] to kill the [[Zhent]] wizard [[Rezlus]] and put an end to his plans to conquer Daggerdale and the greater [[Dalelands]] region. Among this party of adventurers was a [[dwarf]] [[cleric]] who knew the prayer ''consecrated ground''.
