        "mainbody": "'''''Practical Planetology''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'' accessory. It is part of the ''Spelljammer'' campaign setting.\n\n{{Quote|Groundlings have no idea, but any [[spelljamming]] [[adventurer]] worth his salt knows the universe is  huge! Let Practical Planetology open new possibilities for your AD&D SPELLJAMMER campaign.\n<br />\nHerein find fifteen unique planets, exotic and mysterious, ripe for plunder or other less profitable adventures. Weigh anchor at the air world [[Alabeth]], and float with marooned [[elves]] atop their massive [[holbag]]s. Visit the [[mithril dragon]]s of [[Radole]] who ride the hot thermals over lakes of molten tin. Endure the searing flames of the [[efreeti]] city on [[Ignia]], or swim among the island necrocracies—nations of [[undead]] from a destroyed planet—on [[Charon (planet)|Charon]].\n\nThese and other bizarre worlds of adventure await you in Practical Planetology, along with beasts native to them, eleven new monsters in all. All you'll need is a [[spelljammer|ship]], a [[Spelljamming helm|helm]], and a star to steer them by!\n\nPractical Planetology contains material suitable for characters of any level.}}",
