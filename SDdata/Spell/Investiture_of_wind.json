        "mainbody": "Investiture of wind was a transmutation spell that enveloped the caster in whirling protective winds that granted the ability to fly and could also be used as a form of attack.\nThe spell engulfed the caster in winds that lasted for up to 10 minutes, as long as the caster kept concentrating. The winds made it extremely difficult for projectile weapons to hit the caster. They also allowed the caster to fly, as long as the spell remained in effect. Additionally, the spell could create localized areas of concentrated wind that buffeted creatures as far as  away.\nThe spell only required verbal and somatic components."
