'''''Snilloc's heat-seeking snowball''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that worked similarly to ''[[Snilloc's snowball]]'', but did not require visual contact between the caster and the target.

==Effects==
The spell created a ball of magical snow that appeared on the caster's hand and could be immediately thrown at an opponent within a range of {{SI|20|yd|long=yes}}. The snowball always hit its intended target, but could be blocked by the same defenses that blocked the darts created by the ''[[magic missile]]'' spell.

Unlike ''Snilloc's snowball'', this spell did not require the caster to be able to see the intended target.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was either a chunk of ice or a piece of [[ivory]].

==History==
The spell was developed as a minor modification of [[Snilloc]]'s original spell by the [[drow]] [[wizard]] [[Dostrealt]], who was blind. He had developed and collected a number of spells that did not rely on eyesight, so that his spellcasting efficiency was not hindered by his disability.
