        "mainbody": "'''''Fire gate''''' was an [[arcane]] [[alteration]] spell that allowed the caster to step into a large fire and teleport to another such fire.",
        "Effects": "In order for this spell to work, there had to be at least two large fires (a minimum of 2 to 4 ft (60 to 120 cm in diameter) within range of each other. The maximum range was 50 yd (46 m) per level of the caster. If more than one such fire existed within range, then the caster could choose the destination. If no suitable destination was available, the spell fizzled and the caster was left standing in the fire. If the destination was blocked by a solid object such that the caster could not exit the fire, then he or she was stranded in the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] and had to find another way out or be rescued.\n\n''Fire gate'' only transported the caster and what he or she was carrying. This spell did not provide any protection from the flames, so it was highly recommended that the caster had some form of fire protection before stepping into a ''fire gate''.",
        "Components": "Only verbal incantations and two large fires were required to cast this spell.",
        "History": "This spell originated in [[Thay]] as part of the [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard's]] repertoire. It remained a rare spell, however.\n\n''Fire gate'' was acquired at some point by the [[Halruaa]]n mage [[Daltim Flamefist]]. He included it in his [[spellbook]] ''[[Daltim's Tome of Fire]]'', which he lost in [[Tethyr]] in the 1360s [[DR]].",
