        "mainbody": "Hesitation was a divine enchantment spell from the time sphere that caused a target to pause before executing their planned course of action.\nThe slight delay caused by hesitation usually provided enough time for others to act before the target.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a piece of turtle shell to cast.\nThe Tome of Torment, a holy book from the Church of Ilmater, contained the hesitation spell."
