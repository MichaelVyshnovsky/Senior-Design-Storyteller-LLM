Leomunds tiny hut was an evocation spell that created a dome of force around the caster that could be used as a shelter. To Zakharan mages, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as tiny hut, and counted among the spells of the universal province.
The spell created a stationary, hemispherical dome of force with a radius of 10 ft (3.0 m) centered on the caster. Any creature within that range that could completely fit inside the dome, up to a maximum of nine, could pass freely through it, along with all their possessions. The dome was impenetrable to all other creatures, objects or spell effects. It was opaque and monochromatic from the outside, but transparent from the inside. Regardless of the weather outside, the air inside the dome was kept magically dry and at a comfortable temperature, and it generated its own illumination, at the casters command.
The dome lasted for up to 8 hours or until the caster walked out of it.
If cast in space, the dome magically kept a breathable atmosphere inside of it.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was a small crystal bead, The bead would shatter when the spell expired or the caster walked out of the dome. 
By the 1360s DR Leomunds tiny hut was considered a rare spell in the magical communities of both Faerûn, and Zakhara.
In the late 15 century DR, the spell could be found in some regions of Faerûn, such as Chult.
