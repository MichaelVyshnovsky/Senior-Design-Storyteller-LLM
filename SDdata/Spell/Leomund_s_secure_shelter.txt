Leomunds secure shelter was a conjuration spell that created a sturdy cottage.
To Zakharan mages, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as secure shelter, and counted among the spells of the universal province.
On casting Leomunds secure shelter, a cottage created. This cottage was made out of whatever material were found in the area the spell was cast. It was equipped with a clean, dry, and level floor, a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, eight bunks, a trestle table, eight stools, a writing desk, a small fireplace and an unseen servant, the last one was optional. The interior had no automatic air conditioning, if natural insulation was counted out.
As mentioned above, the cottage was made out of whatever material was found in the area. The kind of material did not affect the cottages sturdiness. It was always as strong as a stone building and was protected against fire as though it was made of stone.
It was also hard to break into the cottage. The chimney, door, and the windows were enchanted with an alarm effect, if so prepared. When it came to the door and the windows shutters, they were under the effect of an arcane lock effect. One had a hard time breaking in through the chimney, because it was warded through an iron grate and a narrow flue.
Leomunds secure shelter required somatic, verbal, and material components, but also a focus. The material components of this spell were special. At the very least, one needed a square chip of stone, crushed lime, a few grains of sand, a sprinkling of water, and several splinters of wood to cast the spell at all. If the aforementioned unseen servant effect was desired, one needed to add a string and wood. The focus, a silver wire and a tiny bell, were not strictly necessary to cast the spell, only if the alarm function was desired.
