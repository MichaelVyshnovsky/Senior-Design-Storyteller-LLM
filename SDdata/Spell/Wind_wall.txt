'''''Wind wall''''' was an [[evocation]] spell that created a curtain of wind to repel ranged weapons, disperse gases, and blow away small birds.

==Effects==
The spell created a curtain of wind, {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} thick and at least {{SI|150|ft|long=yes}} long, or more for more experienced or capable casters. It stood vertically, but could otherwise take any continuous path, such as rectangular or cylindrical to protect the area inside. It lasted at least half a minute, or longer with experience. It was invisible, very sturdy, and comprised a roaring gust of wind.

This could blow away flying creatures smaller than [[eagle]]s, preventing them passing through the barrier. It could whip [[paper]]s and such from a person's hand if they were unprepared, and loose items and clothes were propelled upward. It blocked gases, creatures with [[gaseous form]]s (but not [[incorporeal]] creatures), and many kinds of gaseous breath weapons entirely. It deflected [[arrow]]s and [[bolt]]s upward, while heavier ranged weapons had a 1/3{{rd}} greater chance of missing; hurled boulders, [[siege engine]] projectiles, and so on were of course too heavy.

==Components==
It required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]. The divine version required a [[divine focus]], while the arcane version required a tiny fan and a feather of an exotic creature as a [[material component]].

==History==
This spell was developed by [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Tolodine]] as '''''Tolodine's wind wall''''' in {{Yearlink|-2378}}, early in the history of [[Netheril]].

==Notable Appearances==
In [[1364 DR]], [[Robillard]], resident [[wizard]] of the ''[[Sea Sprite]]'', discovered to his chagrin that the spell had virtually no effect on cannon-fire, probably because cannonballs are too fast and too dense.<ref>
