        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to cast a previously memorized medium- to lower-power spell by performing a complex physical gesture. It was quite useful if a wizard found themselves without their spell components.",
        "Components": "This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Laeral created this spell after she was attacked while bathing and not in the vicinity of her spell components."
