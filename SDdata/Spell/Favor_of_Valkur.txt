Favor of Valkur was a divine enchantment spell used by specialty priests devoted to Valkur to protect sailors at sea.
This spell ensured that a sailor who fell overboard would float safely to shore via favorable winds and currents regardless of the weather conditions. Furthermore, the sailor would reach shore without drowning or dying of thirst or hunger. A recipient could only receive the favor of Valkur once during their lifetime. The spell would end either when the favor was fulfilled or one year after its casting.
In addition to verbal components and somatic components, this spell required as material components a piece of driftwood from a ship that sank at sea to cast.
