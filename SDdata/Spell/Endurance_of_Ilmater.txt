Endurance of Ilmater was a divine spell that bolstered the health, strength, and endurance of a protected creature.
The spell could be cast by clerics who commanded the necromantic and protection spheres, and by painbearers, the specialty priests of Ilmater.
The spell had several benefits for the health of the subject creature. It doubled the vitality of the creature, caused them to succeed in tests of strength and endurance, and allowed them to automatically overcome effects that attacked their health, such as disease and shock. Furthermore, the protected creature could never be knocked over by any means.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
Endurance of Ilmater was, of course, named for the god Ilmater, the One Who Endures.
