}}'''''Maximum damage''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that increased the lethality of non-[[Item enchantment|magical]] [[weapon]]s.

==Effects==
Upon casting this spell, the caster enhanced a number of mundane, non-enchanted weapons, causing them to be particularly harmful and inflict the maximum amount of damage of which they were capable. At least nine weapons could be affected by a single casting of ''maximum damage'' but this number increased with the skill and power of the caster. The duration of this spell lasted only a matter of seconds.

This spell had no effects on previously enchanted, or otherwise magical weapons.

==Usage==
This spell was unique to the [[elves]] of [[Evermeet]]. The specifications of its casting were a well-kept secret of the island realm.

==Casting==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a rod of [[silver]], worth at least 100 [[gp]]. Any weapons affected by this spell had to be in contact with the rod at the time of its casting.
