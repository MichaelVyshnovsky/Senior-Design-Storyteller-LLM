Bolt of glory was an evocation spell that struck a target with a blast of positive energy.
By casting this spell, one projected a bolt of energy from the Positive Energy Plane against one creature. A creature struck took varying damage, depending on its nature and home plane of existence, with evil outsiders and those from the Negative Energy Plane being most strongly affected.
