'''''Bolt of glory''''' was an [[evocation]] spell that struck a target with a blast of [[positive energy]].

==Effect==
By casting this spell, one projected a bolt of energy from the [[Positive Energy Plane]] against one creature. A creature struck took varying damage, depending on its nature and home [[plane]] of existence, with evil [[outsider]]s and those from the [[Negative Energy Plane]] being most strongly affected.
