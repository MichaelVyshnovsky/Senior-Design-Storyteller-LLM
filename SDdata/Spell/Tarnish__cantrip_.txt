'''''Tarnish''''' was a reversed [[cantrip]] that apprentice [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It was the opposite of the ''[[shine]]'' cantrip and caused an object to be covered in rust, verdigris, tarnish, or corrosion of the type to which the object was naturally susceptible.

==Effects==
The target of this spell had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster and could affect one object of up to {{SI|1|cu yd|long=yes}} in volume. The surface of the object had to be made of a substance that was subject to corrosion of some kind typically caused by age, use, or environmental conditions.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster pantomimed sprinkling something on a surface while making a spitting sound with the lips.
