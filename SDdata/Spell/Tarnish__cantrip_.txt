Tarnish was a reversed cantrip that apprentice wizards could learn. It was the opposite of the shine cantrip and caused an object to be covered in rust, verdigris, tarnish, or corrosion of the type to which the object was naturally susceptible.
The target of this spell had to be within  of the caster and could affect one object of up to  in volume. The surface of the object had to be made of a substance that was subject to corrosion of some kind typically caused by age, use, or environmental conditions.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster pantomimed sprinkling something on a surface while making a spitting sound with the lips.
