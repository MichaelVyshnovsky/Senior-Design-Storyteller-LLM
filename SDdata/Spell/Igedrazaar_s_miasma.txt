Igedrazaars miasma was a spell used by sorcerers and wizards.
When cast, the spell created a toxic fog. The fog was gray in color and had a disgusting appearance. Any creature within the fog suffered damage, whether they held their breath or not.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a focus, three grey stones that were polished to a shine.
