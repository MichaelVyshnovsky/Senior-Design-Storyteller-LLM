Possess was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
Similar to possess animal, this spell was able to gain possession of any type of natural animal or sentient creature. The shugenja did not gain any of the abilities of the target creature. If the possessed creature was hurt, the shugenja absorbed some of the damage. If the possessed creature died, the shugenja had to be strong enough to withstand the shock to their system, or they died as well. While possessing a creature, the shugenjas body fell into a catatonic state. If they are disturbed while the spell is in effect, their soul was reunited with their body and the spell expired. After the creature is released, they had no memory of the possession.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, incense and a small figurine of the creature the shugenja wished to posses.
