Obliviasphere was a spell that created a spherical barrier that rebounded spells as wild magic.
The spell generated a sphere of force no less than  in diameter that, for ten minutes, blocked the passage of living creatures other than the caster into or out of it, and of all spells. When a spell or living creature tried to cross the spheres boundary, they rebounded, and wild magic burst out of the sphere. For most spells, the burst of wild magic rebounded in a random direction, but living creatures were struck by the wild magic in full.
Of note, the wild magic could turn someone unlucky and close by into a myconid.
Besides verbal and somatic components, the spell called for any part of a myconid, and a piece of rock crystal that was polished clear.
Azuth made this spell available through Elminster sometime prior to .
