        "mainbody": "'''''Status''''' was a [[divination]] spell, prior to the [[Spellplague]], that allowed one to monitor the positions and conditions of one's allies. The spell that proved rather useful when [[adventurer]]s became separated. Following the Spellplague, ''status'' became a divination [[ritual]] that only monitored the conditions of one's allies.",
        "Effect": "The caster became mentally aware of the directions and distances to their allies and of whether they were unharmed or suffering any debilitating condition. Once cast, it functioned over any distance provided they were on the same [[plane]]. Initially, it covered two allies and lasted three hours, but these increased for more experienced casters.\n\nWhen a [[cleric]] needs to keep track of comrades that may get separated, ''status'' allows him to mentally monitor their relative position and general condition. The cleric is aware of direction and distance to the creatures and their status: unharmed, wounded, disabled, staggered, unconscious, dying, dead, etc. Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same [[plane]] of existence. If they leave it, the spell ceases to function for them.\n\nFollowing the Spellplague, ''status'' lasted for a period of 24 hours and the caster could only target up to eight other individuals. However, the ritual version of the spell continued to not persist across planes.",
        "Components": "It required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s. Following the Spellplague, the ritual version of ''status'' required the caster and their targets to all consume some sort of foul-tasting brew that was prepared for the ritual. The cost of preparing this brew was generally around 135 [[gold piece]]s."
