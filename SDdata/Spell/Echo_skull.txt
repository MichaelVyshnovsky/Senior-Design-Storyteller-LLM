Additionally, the caster could cast certain spells, those that were ranged and had no [[material component]] or focus, through the skull. The spell expired if the skull was destroyed.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[spell focus|focus]]: a dried skull of an animal.
