        "mainbody": "Forgotten melody was a divine enchantment spell used by priests devoted to Milil, enabling them to cause others to obsess over a tune.\nThis spell caused creatures within a  cube of the caster to become obsessed with a song sung by the caster. Victims would repeat the lyrics in their head over and over trying to get it right, making it impossible for them to perform any other actions. This spell was more effective on more intelligent beings, forcing them to focus on the song for a longer period of time. Forgotten melody had no effect upon the undead, creatures with animal intelligence or less, creatures who could not hear, or creatures who did not understand the casters language.\nThis spell required only verbal components to cast."
