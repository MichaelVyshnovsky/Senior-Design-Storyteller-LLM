        "mainbody": "'''''Forgotten melody''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Milil]], enabling them to cause others to obsess over a tune.",
        "Effects": "This spell caused creatures within a {{SI|60|ft}} cube of the caster to become obsessed with a song sung by the caster. Victims would repeat the lyrics in their head over and over trying to get it right, making it impossible for them to perform any other actions. This spell was more effective on more intelligent beings, forcing them to focus on the song for a longer period of time. ''Forgotten melody'' had no effect upon the [[undead]], creatures with animal intelligence or less, creatures who could not hear, or creatures who did not understand the caster's language.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal component]]s to cast."
