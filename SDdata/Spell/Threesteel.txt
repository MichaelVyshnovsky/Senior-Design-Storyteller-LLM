Threesteel was a spell that turned a blade into three seeking missiles.
The instant a blade was selected by its carrier for use in threesteel, it shimmered briefly and split into three blades. Each flew forth on its own, striking at targets the spell-user intended within close range. For the duration of the attack, the weapon was magical, if it wasnt already. Whether it was or not, the weapon would not survive the spell. Earlier reports of the spell instead reported that the blade could be within  of the caster, and had similar range, as well as the ability to do harm to any creature bar those affected only by the strongest magical weapons.
Only blades that a man-sized wielder could reasonably use (so, as large as a greatsword at the most) could be affected. Per earlier reports the spell required only the metal be three-quarters or more present, and required only a blade, not necessarily a weapon.
The spell had only a verbal component.
The spell was first developed by Delgarth of Sumbarim.
