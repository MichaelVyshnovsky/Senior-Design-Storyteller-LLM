Sylvan form was a divine alteration spell from the animal sphere that allowed the caster to assume the form of any non-evil humanoid sylvan creature.
Any equipment carried by the caster would be melded into their new form. The spell lasted for several hours depending on the skill of the caster.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the casting priests holy symbol to cast.
Sylvan form was granted by Corellon Larethian.
