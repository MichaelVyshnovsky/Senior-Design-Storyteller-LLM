Silent portal was an illusion spell or glamer used by wizards, sorcerers, and assassins.
This spell negated any sound made by opening or closing a single non-magical portal by normal means. Smashing a window would still make noise for example. The portal could be a door, window, gate, chest lid, etc.
This spell required only somatic components to cast.
