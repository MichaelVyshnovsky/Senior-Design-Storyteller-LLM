'''''Silent portal''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] or [[glamer]] used by [[wizard]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[assassin]]s.

==Effects==
This spell negated any sound made by opening or closing a single non-magical portal by normal means. Smashing a window would still make noise for example. The portal could be a door, window, gate, chest lid, etc.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.
