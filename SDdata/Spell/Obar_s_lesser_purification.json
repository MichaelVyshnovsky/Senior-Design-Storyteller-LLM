        "mainbody": "Obars lesser purification was an arcane abjuration spell that destroyed any curses, tracers, or remnants of any magic linked to inanimate objects. It was used to treat the shell component in the creation of magical items.\nThe main function of this spell was to remove any dweomers, or lingering magic, from items in order to make them non-magical. In addition, it could purge liquids, unguents, or tinctures as well as powders or dusts used to prepare items for enchantment.\nThe material components of lesser purification were a pinch of limestone dust, a pinch of salt, and three drops of a potion of sweetwater."
