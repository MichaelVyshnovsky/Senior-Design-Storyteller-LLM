        "mainbody": "'''''Obar's lesser purification''''' was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that destroyed any [[curse]]s, tracers, or remnants of any [[magic]] linked to inanimate objects. It was used to treat the shell component in the creation of [[Item enchantment|magical items]].",
        "Effects": "The main function of this spell was to remove any ''dweomers'', or lingering magic, from items in order to make them non-magical. In addition, it could purge liquids, unguents, or tinctures as well as powders or dusts used to prepare items for enchantment.",
        "Components": "The material components of ''lesser purification'' were a pinch of [[limestone]] dust, a pinch of salt, and three drops of a ''[[potion of sweetwater]]''."
