'''''Comforts of home''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to [[priest]]s of [[Cyrrollalee]], the Hearthkeeper. It granted the recipient the illusion of having good food, a soft bed, a bath, and a fresh change of clothes.

==Effects==
The caster had to touch a willing recipient in order to cast this spell. The effects lasted for eight hours. When cast, the target's mind was convinced that hard ground was a soft bed and paltry food was warm, tasty, and filling. Experiencing the ''comforts of home'' eased the stress of difficult travel conditions and allowed the recipient to get a full night of gentle bed rest, awakening with renewed vigor, natural healing, the feeling of having bathed and donned fresh clothing, and being mentally prepared to study or pray for spells.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s as well as the use of the priest's [[holy symbol]].
