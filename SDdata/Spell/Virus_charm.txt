Virus charm was an arcane enchantment spell, similar to mass charm, that could spread from a single creature to other individuals by touch.
When casting this spell, it was important that the first target be a creature less robust than the caster for the virus to take hold&mdasha child or a commoner, for example. If the first target was not less healthy or weaker than the caster, then this spell functioned like a simple charm person or charm monster and had no viral capability. If they failed to resist the spell, they became charmed and regarded the caster as a trusted friend and ally. They could pass the charm on by touching other persons or creatures, each of which had one chance to resist (again, more robust individuals had a better chance to resist) or become an ally of the caster and able to infect others, and so on.
Virus charm could infect over fifty creatures (more for higher level casters) and they remained charmed for a period of one day to weeks and even months depending on their intelligence. Similar to basic charm spells, if the caster attacked any individual currently under his or her sway, all creatures under the influence of the same spell received another chance to shake off the enchantment. A successful dispel magic cast on any virus charmed individual broke the spell for all creatures infected by the same spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, a fine mesh, web, or net of thinly drawn copper wire valued at about 100 gp was required.
This spell was known to have been recorded in the spellbook Tidings of Conflict and Woe by an unknown author, but sages generally attributed the work to Cymbre of the Moonshae Isles and her daughter Amye. It was later published in Volos Guide to All Things Magical and became generally known to the magical community, although it was rare to find it.
