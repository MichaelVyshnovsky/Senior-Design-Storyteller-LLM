Trap the soul was a sorcerer and wizard conjuration spell, considered by some to be evil, that allowed the caster to trap the life force and material body (if any) of a creature inside a gem.
The caster could complete the spell normally, by speaking the final word of the spell once the target was in range and if speaking their name they would bypass any magic resistances the creature might have. Alternatively, the caster could create a trigger object that would entrap the creature within their gem upon being touched. Some casters would try to ensure this outcome by casting sympathy upon the trigger object. Creating a trigger object required the spells final word and the creatures name, or in older versions its true name, to be inscribed upon the trigger object as the gem was being enspelled. This inscription of their name similarly bypassed any magic resistances the creature might possess.
This spell had a permanent duration, holding creatures captured by it indefinitely. They could only be released by breaking their gem, upon which their body would materialize. If the creature was a powerful outsider, then upon being freed from their imprisonment they might be required to perform a service for the one who freed them, otherwise they were left to go free. For this reason, some casters would pair the spells usage with spells that summoned powerful outsiders, such as cacofiend.
If the gem being used by a caster was not of a high enough value compared to the power of the creature, the gem would shatter instead of functioning properly. And if trap the soul were to be cast upon a devourer, it would affect the spirit trapped within the fiend instead of the creature itself.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component in the form of a gem worth at least 1,000 gold pieces. The more powerful the creature being trapped, the more valuable the gem had to be. The value necessary to trap the desired creature was something casters could research, though this necessary value could change over time.
Older versions of the spell required that the caster enchant their gem by means of the enchant an item and maze spells.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Dethed in  and was originally known as Detheds trap.
