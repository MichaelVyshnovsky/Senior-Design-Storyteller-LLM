'''''Trap the soul''''' was a [[sorcerer]] and [[wizard]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]], considered by some to be [[evil]], that allowed the caster to trap the [[soul|life force]] and material body (if any) of a creature inside a [[gem]].

==Effects==
The caster could complete the spell normally, by speaking the final word of the spell once the target was in range and if speaking their name they would bypass any [[magic resistance]]s the creature might have. Alternatively, the caster could create a trigger object that would entrap the creature within their gem upon being touched. Some casters would try to ensure this outcome by casting ''[[sympathy]]'' upon the trigger object. Creating a trigger object required the spell's final word and the creature's name, or in older versions its [[true name]], to be inscribed upon the trigger object as the gem was being enspelled. This inscription of their name similarly bypassed any magic resistances the creature might possess.

This spell had a permanent duration, holding creatures captured by it indefinitely. They could only be released by breaking their gem, upon which their body would materialize. If the creature was a powerful [[outsider]], then upon being freed from their imprisonment they might be required to perform a service for the one who freed them, otherwise they were left to go free. For this reason, some casters would pair the spell's usage with spells that summoned powerful outsiders, such as ''[[cacofiend]]''.<ref>

If the gem being used by a caster was not of a high enough value compared to the power of the creature, the gem would shatter instead of functioning properly. And if ''trap the soul'' were to be cast upon a [[devourer]], it would affect the spirit trapped within the [[fiend]] instead of the creature itself.<ref>

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]] in the form of a gem worth at least 1,000 [[gold piece]]s. The more powerful the creature being trapped, the more valuable the gem had to be. The value necessary to trap the desired creature was something casters could research, though this necessary value could change over time.

Older versions of the spell required that the caster [[item enchantment|enchant]] their gem by means of the ''[[enchant an item]]'' and ''[[maze]]'' spells.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Dethed]] in {{Yearlink|-1883}} and was originally known as ''Dethed's trap''.

Some of the inhabitants of [[Esh Alakar]] in [[Maztica]] were trapped in gems beneath the ruins of the site, after falling victim to this spell.
