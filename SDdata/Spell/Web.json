        "mainbody": "'''''Web''''', formerly known as '''''Shan's web''''', was a [[spell]] that filled an area with sticky spider-webs that ensnared those caught in the area. An identical spell was used in [[Maztica]] by [[hishnashaper]]s and [[cleric]]s, where it was called '''''net'''''.",
        "Users": "The ''web'' spell could be learned and cast by [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s with access to the [[conjuration]] school of [[magic]]. In the time of [[Netheril]], it could be cast by [[arcanist]]s of the Inventive specialization. In [[Zakhara]], [[elemental mage]]s and [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]] could learn it as part of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].",
        "Effects": "After the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], a caster could, up to a distance of 100 ft (30 m) or more depending on their level, create a multi-layered collection of strong and sticky strands or fibers. These were rather like spider webs, but were much thicker and tougher. These spread over an area 40 ft (12 m) wide, but the strands had to be anchored to stable, diametrically opposite objects; a part of the ''web'' that was not so anchored would collapse in on itself and vanish. These strands entangled creatures caught within the ''web'', hampering their movements. One had to either force their way or slip nimbly between the strands in order to pass through them. One who was unwary or too slow to react when the spell was cast could become trapped in place, and only with a great feat of strength or escape artistry could they break free.\n\nA ''web'' spell lasted tens of minutes according to the caster's power, but it could be made permanent through a ''[[permanency]]'' spell. The strands were flammable, so the ''web'' would slowly burn if ignited, injuring creatures caught within. A permanent ''web'' that was damaged but not wholly burned would regrow in ten minutes.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components, a casting of ''web'' required a small piece of an actual spider web.",
        "History": "The ''web'' spell was first introduced in the time of [[Netheril]], in [[-654 DR|3205 NY (âˆ’654 DR)]], under the name ''Shan's web'', after the [[arcanist]] [[Shan (arcanist)|Shan]]. It later became known simply as ''web''.\n\nIn the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], [[Kyriani Agrivar]] and [[Onyx the Invincible]] dueled the [[wizard]] [[Parwyyd Hanifar]] and his personal assistant [[Dunstanny]] outside the [[Great Door]]. Moving into a niche, Dunstanny suggested that Parwyyd employ a ''web'' over the entrance, anchored high and low with minimum depth. It soon trapped Kyri and Onyx like flies and ended the fight.{{Cite comic/The Ostus Legacy|13}}\n\n''Web'' was commonly known and used by the magical community by [[1358 DR]]. It was one of the spells within ''[[Galadaster's Orizon]]''."
