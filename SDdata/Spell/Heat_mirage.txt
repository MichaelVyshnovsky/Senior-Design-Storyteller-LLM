}}'''''Heat mirage''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This spell enhanced the desert's natural abilities to create mirages. If cast upon an area of the desert already creating a mirage, this spell added olfactory and auditory components to the mirage.

Heat mirage was particularly useful for luring victims into an ambush. The mirage illusion was not dispelled until something actually tried to drink from the oasis, allowing bandits to hide in plain sight.

==Components==
This spell did not require physical components to cast.
