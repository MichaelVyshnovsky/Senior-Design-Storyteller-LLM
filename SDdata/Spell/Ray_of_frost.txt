'''''Ray of frost''''' was an arcane [[spell]] that released a ray of cold energy.

==Description==
When cast, the spell [[conjuration|conjure]]d a frigid blast of cold, freezing white or blue air which then streaked towards its intended target, over a distance of no more than sixty feet, slowing their movements down for a brief moment.

==History==
Prior to the [[Spellplague]], ''ray of frost'' could be cast by both [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s and like all other spells, with the exception of [[invocation]]s, ray of frost could not be cast at-will but had to be prepared. ''Ray of frost'' was also considered a [[cantrip]], or a very basic spell known to virtually all wizards, though it lost this status following the Spellplague, becoming a fully-ranked spell. However, after the [[Second Sundering]], it was again classed as a cantrip, though in this era, cantrips did not have to be prepared, and could be cast at-will.

==Components==
The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components.

==Notable Users==
* [[Green Hag of the Lizard Marsh]] used the ''ray of frost'' as the final step in preparation of the [[hag]] treat - "Eye Scream"m out of [[newt]] eyes, [[blueberries]], and fetid swamp water. The recipe was detailed in ''[[the Witch's Brew Cookbook]]''.
