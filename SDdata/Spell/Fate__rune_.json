        "mainbody": "Fate was a type of giant rune used for divination that could alter the luck of other creatures.\nIn order to activate this rune the wielder of the inscribed coin needed to desire to divine a specific individuals fate for the following date. This individual needed to be physically present for the reading and consent to it. Finally, the wielder needed to toss the coin into the air.\nIf the coin landed with the rune-inscribed side facing up, then the individual would experience greater luck the next day. If the coin landed with the rune-inscribed side facing down, then the individual would experience worse luck. If by chance the coin landed on its side, then something disastrous would befall the individual.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast. The process of shaping this rune generally took around one to eight minutes and it needed to be inscribed upon the side of a coin."
