        "mainbody": "Still water was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur that calmed water. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, even the most tempestuous waters would be rendered still and placid. A ship-based wu jen used this spell to calm choppy seas during a storm. Only the most powerful forces were unaffected by this spell, such as a tsunami. Since the spell worked by manipulating the rate of flow of the water, the spell could be used on whirlpools and rapids. If this spell was cast on a creature from the Elemental Plane of Water, the creature was unable to be directly hostile to the casting wu jen. \nThe reverse of this spell was turbulence. This spell cancelled out still water. If cast on calm water, it caused the water to become turbulent. It could be cast on an already stormy seas, creating waves capable of capsizing ships. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component a small vial of whale oil. The material component for turbulence was a small ornamental fan."
