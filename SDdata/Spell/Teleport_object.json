        "mainbody": "'''''Teleport object''''', also known as '''''vanish''''', was a [[conjuration]]/teleportation (or [[alteration]], depending on where and when it was it was learned) spell that worked like ''[[teleport]]'' except it did not function for creatures or magical forces (like a ''[[Bigby's hand]]'', for example).",
        "Effects": "A wizard that advanced enough to cast this spell could teleport an object up to 650 lb (295 kg) and 39 ft<sup>3</sup> (1.1 m<sup>3</sup>) in size, but if the caster attempted an object beyond his or her power, the spell would fail. More experienced casters could effect bigger and heavier objects. The destination had to be on the same [[plane]] as the caster, or could be a location on the [[Ethereal plane]]. If the Ethereal plane was the chosen destination, then the spot where the object stood retained a faint magical aura until the object returned. Successfully casting ''[[dispel magic]]'' on the spot brought the item back from the Ethereal.\n\nBefore this spell was improved, each time an item was teleported there was a 1% chance it would disintegrate and be lost, and a 1% chance that a creature from the Ethereal Plane could gain access to the [[Prime Material Plane]] at the point of origin of the object. Later versions of this spell did not have these drawbacks.",
        "Components": "The caster had to touch the object as part of casting this spell. This spell required only a [[verbal component|verbal command]] to cast.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Yong]] in {{Yearlink|-1667}} and was originally called ''Yong's dissipation''."
