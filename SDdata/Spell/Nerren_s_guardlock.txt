Nerrens guardlock was a combination spell attributed to Nerren Prentiyuel. It combined the effects of arcane lock with magic missile.
The guardlock spell operated as a version of arcane lock which unleashed a volley of magic missiles into the first unauthorized creature to touch it. However, every time someone failed to dispel it or cancel it with a knock or dispel magic spell, the spell instead absorbed the magic and stored it as an additional volley of magic missiles.
The material component for this spell was a spiders web and a strand of the casters hair.
The spell was attributed to Nerren Prentiyuel.
