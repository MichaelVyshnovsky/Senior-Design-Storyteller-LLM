Watery double was an enchantment and conjuration spell used by wizards and waveservants.
This spell was cast on a body of water of any size, ranging from an ocean all the way down to a glass of wine. The spell was triggered when the first creatures reflection appeared on the surface of the body of water, forming an exact watery duplicate of the creature provided there was enough volume of water present to match the creatures size. The spell would last on the body of water indefinitely until trigged by a reflection. The spell would even prevent a smaller body of water from evaporating until it was triggered.
Once formed, the watery double attempted to touch the creature whose reflection it wore, merging with the target and covering their body with liquid. The watery double forced its way into the victim, causing an extreme amount of pain in the process. The watery double could move twice as fast as its parent creature, including moving into tight spaces like under doors or through cracks.
A watery double could be destroyed by spells such as part water, lower water, and transmute water to dust.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast.
