        "mainbody": "Luiren (|audio=  The capital city of Luiren was the coastal city of Beluir, in the longitudinal center of the realm. The nation was flooded and known as the Gulf of Luiren during the century that followed the Spellplague.\nthumb|Political map showing the borders of Luiren.|350x350px\nLuiren was a nation on the shores of the Great Sea, nestled between Dambrath and Estagund. It was known for its green forests and verdant lands and sprawling and winding irrigated farmlands. Many halflings migrated across the country every six months or so from one settlement to the next. They left their homes behind in good condition for the next occupant to take over.\nAfter the Spellplague and the relatively short land recovery period, Luiren returned to its rural agricultural state. Hin were not in a rush to rebuild big cities, enjoying living in pastoral communities and market towns while the population slowly recovered its lost numbers. The calamitous strife did leave a long-lasting mark on Luiren. It taught halflings to \"improve\" their infrastructure, building wider and better bridges and roads that did not turn into mud sinkholes every winter.\nLuiren cities and towns had one-third of all its buildings being collections of small caves with halfling-sized entryways. The subterranean homes with no windows helped hin control the sweltering temperatures. These structures were called \"halfole.\" Communal buildings and places that served travelers typically stood above ground and had more tall-folk-friendly designs.\nThe hin country had several major settlements. When travelers entered Luiren from the Great Trade Way, the first settlement they passed was Ammathluir, a trading city hub in the Ammathvale. The Great Trade Ways Luiren offshoot continued towards the capital of Beluir on the coast, and a minor road ran from Ammathluir north towards the town of Crimel on the edge of Lluirwood. South of Beluir, one could find the town of Chethel and the city of Krenadir on the tip of a peninsula of the same name. Traveling along the coast northeast of the capital, travelers could reach Ojannath, Lluirvale further north, the city of Shoun further east, and lastly, the town of Fasruil northeast from Shoon.\nThe furthest of Luirens settlements is Deepburrow. It reached Upper Great Bhaerynden through a deep ravine that ran across the city in the Toadsquat Mountains shadow on their northwestern side. Underneath, Deepburrow had access to extensive natural cavers that allowed halflings to mine and trade with the communities of the Underdark.\nLuiren was a hot coastal country with about  of coastline on the Great Sea. Most of the coastal area was made up of plains, but heavy forests took up the northern, northeastern, and western areas. A large forest called the Lluirwood encircled the farming lowlands within its  band of thickly forested land that stretched for over  from east to west with its eastern part being a lush wet jungle. Luirens major wetland was the Mortik Swamp, on the Krenalir Peninsula, to the Hambone Bays south. An elongated Isle of Quelthiir, a -long and -wide sandbar, with low hills and sea grass with only the occasional stunted tree was considered part of Luiren. It sheltered the bay from the Great Seas storms.\nThere existed a longe gate in northeastern Luiren that connected the hin country to the furtherest northwestern of the Five Shires on the world of Mystara. Some believed the gate may had been destroyed by the 15 century DR. It once was used by Elminster Aumar, the Old Mage of Shadowdale, but apart from hin merchant, the gate remained widely unused and unknown.\nDuring the summer months, the temperatures in Luiren could exceed . The summer heat and humidity were hard to handle by those not used to the south. Thankfully, the constant breeze from the Great Sea made Luiren summers tolerable. Winter months were characterized by heavy downpours that made land travel and trade hard. Most caravans paused their terrestrial routes during the three rainy months. However, summer rains were beneficial for Luirens abundant fruit crops.\nthumb|Hin wardens luring a tall mouther into a trap.|340x340px\nLluirwood was a wild forest of monstrous dangers of predatory and environmental nature. At least one yuan-ti community and a beholder in its forest fortress inhabited Granuin as well.\nThe regions only large wetland – the Mortick Swamp, located on the Hambone Bay, was home to many dangerous pests such as giant ticks, various spiders, wasps, and other insects, all served as a food source for the swamps giant frog population.\nTerrifying creatures known as the tall mouthers hunted for their favorite food – halflings, in the border wilderness of Luiren. The tall mouthers inspired a popular hin saying, \"he got mouthed,\" which meant an adventurer had perished. The Lluirwood was home to many dangerous creatures such as stirges, giant spiders, flying snakes, rhino beetles, and others, in addition to such mundane beasts as deer.\nLurien was home to a small-numbered and reclusive humanoid species known as \"marshwiggles,\" or sind. As the name suggested, sindar lived in Luirens and Veldorn swamplands. They avoided contact with outsiders and were known to rig complex alarms against outsiders in their habitats. The species was uninterested in trade or travel with other cultures.\n\"As important as the Prince of Luiren\" was a famous sarcastic saying in the hin country. There never was a prince or a single ruler in the land. The number was reduced to just over 600,000 by the late 15 century DR, following the flooding during the Spellplague and the subsequent struggles after the waters receded.\nThe nation had little to no governmental or civic agencies simply because they were not needed, not wanted, and no hin would even be interested in working in such an organization. Each hin settlement governed itself independently from the wider nation. Each town had a mayor and a council of Elders, even though even these positions were not universal across Luiren. Elders were willing citizens older than 90 years old in charge of decision-making in the settlement, elected a mayor from their number, and selected the hin wardens to serve the community.\nLuiren had a code of laws, but it was open to interpretation. Most minor crimes and misdeeds were handled with a stern talk and a finger wag. The only universally prosecutable deeds in the land of the hin were capital crimes. There was no established punishment for certain crimes. Thieves could be sent out into the wilderness with their possessions confiscated, or con artists could have their scams turned against them in a very ironic matter. One of the aforementioned capital offenses was the murder of a halfling. Murderers were dealt with harsh swiftness – with a noose and a tree.\nHin taxation was light and was intended only to cover the expenses of running the settlement.\nthumb|One of Luirens festivals.|350x350px\nMost outsiders had a perception that Luiren was a slow-moving countryside of greenery, pipeweed smoking, happy rotund halflings, ripe for conquest. Even though there was much truth in the bardic stories, travelers to Luiren were often surprised to find the locals adventurous and bold and not just the fat and quiet halflings one could find elsewhere. Hin of Luiren enjoyed \"turning tables\" on \"poor tall people\" who visited the realm. They intentionally provided tall guests with small furniture, gave them lodgings in buildings with low ceilings, and liked to talk loudly and slowly as if the tall people were mentally slower than the short folk. Many tall folk often took advantage of the hin, and in turn, halflings treated them the same. However, visitors who were polite, friendly, and open to spending their coin were treated well by halflings of Luiren.\nLuireners loved the Games, local, regional, and national competitions of obstacle-running and kite-fighting, sometimes changing to a different sport.\nLuiren and had no upper class. The closest thing to what other regions considered upper class were wealthy merchant clans, or chakas in neighboring southern lands. Almost the entire population of the nation consisted of the lower class and a staggeringly large percentage of the middle-class. All halflings of Luiren lived comfortably. Middle-class hin were artisans, bakers, merchants, and similar professions.\nHalflings of Luiren spoke Luiric and were talented woodcarvers. Hin were culturally polite even to those they disliked, even if an arrow in the back was later due. The most prominent cultural events in Luiren were its many festivals, especially the grand festivities in spring and fall. The annual spring festival celebrated the end of the three-month winter downpour and the reopening of land trade. The fall festival was a three-day-long engagement that took place after the seasonal harvest was done. Outsiders considered the fall festivals the wildest celebration theyve ever seen, where \"the food and drink fall from the sky.\"\nGnomes were thought to be busybodies by the halfling of Luiren. Dambraii human nobles were considered to be dimwitted and arrogant, while \"as smart as a human\" was used as the direst of all halfling insults. Hin thought the people of Durpar to be sneaky scoundrels and Halruaans to be silly men who were ready to buy dirt as long as the label said \"spell component.\"\nHalflings in Luiren liked to derive their family names from their occupations proudly. Such family names as Brewer, Vintner, or Carver, were common.\nA stereotypical halfling schoolteacher in Luiren would wear a simple and proper combination of a long and black divided skirt, a bright and stiffly starched button-down long-sleeved blouse with a tall white collar. Long-haired teachers kept their hair in severely tight buns.\nHalflings of Luiren had a peculiar popular hair fashion they tightly tied a single lock of hair with a ribbon.\n\"Only the baker makes the bread right\" was a respected phrase in Luiren. Cooking was a highly regarded skill in Luiren, with wealthier individuals keeping a professional cook on the payroll and some becoming gourmet chefs themselves. Social custom dictated that a hin had to feed their guests well, invited or uninvited, and taste sensations or new culinary inventions could make their creator rich as they swept the country and became much in demand at festivals and other social gatherings.\nSome hin, particularly in the priesthood, learned to elevate their cooking skills to create curative stews and nutritious soups that could aid in the natural healing process, or even cure diseases such as measles, malaria, or even more deadly strains such as smallpox or the plague. Some magical diseases could be cured, although such soups were not effective against either mummy rot or lycanthropy, nor the common cold. The secrets of such cooking were closely guarded, and it was rare for any outsiders to be taught the skills necessary, which could take years to master. Luiren spring cheese was said to be a key ingredient in some of the recipes. It was also used to make molten cheese fondue.\nAmong some of the dishes native to Luiren was Harelveauplum sauce sweet, spicy, and acidic condiment cooked with plums and thello-fruit, sometimes served with lamb meatballs. Hin also made stuffed fried hardcrust roundbread filled with minced-meat, spices, and vegetables. Other specialty foods included dried apricots, salbread – a type of crusty travel-bread made with lemon and orange peel Thalimvur was a gnomish and hin delicacy of maggots fried in maple syrup or maple sap, and bhaerulb was a stew of mealworms and onions.\nApart from hearty foods and sweet confections, hin of Luiren knew how to brew and distill and liked strong drinks. Luiren Rivengut was a notoriously strong distilled and aged clear whiskey favored by many hin of Luiren and beyond. Luiren also produced fine ale which was exported as far as the city of Westgate and quality stout, found as far as Cormyr. Luirens Best was a rare export but its quality and scarcity made it well sought after as far north as the City of Splendors, Waterdeep. Oldest Ancient Stout was an accidentally uncovered libation, sealed in an ancient flask, found in Luiren by an industrious hin some years before the late 14 century DR. The stout was unspoiled and the recipe for the drink was found along the flask. With time, the drink became a valuable commodity produced only in the hin nation.\nTo no surprise, halflings of Luiren worshiped Yondallas Children, the hin pantheon, including Arvoreen, Cyrrollalee, Sheela Peryroyl, Urogalan, and Yondalla Despite not being very religious folk, hin also venerated Silvanus, Following the Time of Troubles, specialty priests of Arvoreen and Yondalla started appearing in Luiren, but remained quite rare for several years that followed.\nHalflings trained a special type of bard called whistler. Each settlement in Luiren had at least one whistler who could use bardic magical whistling to control the weather, control plants, and summon animals.\nthumb|A well-fed halfling with famous Luiren cheese and stout.|400x400px\nLurien had wide-reaching trade relationships. Among the hin nations Shining South neighbors, merchants from Luiren often were found along the Halruaan sea shores. Food items were the main export from Luiren in Halruaa. Imported goods were arriving to Luiren via the Traders Way route and by sea, including goods and traders of Dambrath. Him merchants were fiercely competitive and ruthless in their dealings with Dambrath, from where goods from Luiren traveled across Faerûn.\nLuiren was a major exporter of fruits, vegetables, and other produce, sending out thousands of boat-fulls of goods to the rest of Faerûn. Much of produce consumed across the Sword Coast came from Luiren. alcohol, such as beers, fine ales, stouts, and overly potent Luiren Rivengut. During the century of the Spellplague, survivors of the flooding were known to create and export spiced cheeses. Fruits like bananas were often sold to neighboring nations of Durpar and Halruaa.\nLuiren was known for its pottery as early as the 900 DR. Halfling pottery was known for its utility decorative pots and dishes adorned with lapis and malachite were rare. Such decorative items were traced to a certain period in Luirens history circa 750-830 DR. Brown-red clay pottery created outside that century was bottom-heavy and generally simple in design. They were glazed in an ochre or bright green finish. The hin of Luiren also produced ebony wood, exported as far as the Hordelands.\nHalfling artificers from Luiren received gainful employ in the nearby wizardly nation of Halruaa, where their sharp minds and small hands were invaluable when handling tiny gears of clockwork devices. In the late 14 century DR, they were employed by the nations Queen Beatrix.\nLuiren was among several other welcoming southern countries where types of traveling entertainers often wintered, many taking on several month-long performing contracts, some art and craft jobs, or other \"winter jobs.\" The \"wretched\" Red Wizards of Thay were not allowed entry to Luiren despite Thay issuing several requests to establish an enclave in Beluir as of the late 14 century DR.\nLuiren did not have its own currency. The country had several currencies of the Shining Lands in rotation Durparian vellim, Dambraii shebs and crints, and Halruan electrum skie. However, bartering was the most common form of commerce with no need of currency. Many hin could spend years without seeing a single coin.\nHistorically, ancient hin tribes of southern Luiren used a unique type of weapon called spindle-disks. The weapon was constructed using rock crystal shaped into two razor-sharp disks about a human fingers size. The two crystal disks were put on a string and flicked toward the opponent, making the disks spin forward to deal damage and then roll back to the halfling. By the mid-14 century DR the weapon was mostly forgotten about apart from being described in books.\nBrage individuals among Luirens best often joined city watch, including the capital citys Beluir Watch, members of which were known for their alertness and courage. A typical member of the Beluir Watch served just for a few years before moving on to a different vocation, yet many stayed with the Watch for a lifetime. Those who served for five years were rewarded with enchanted cloaks of the Beluir Watch, each was inscribed with words of Yondalla, a halfling deity, in Luiric, saying \"Lead By Example.\"\nOutside of the Beluir Watch, hin who kept the peace and provided the community with security were called warders, selected from pools of willing candidates by the local Elders. Wardens wore no identifiable uniforms and were capable fighters and thieves who defended locals from brigands and monsters. The only identifiable part of a wardens outfit was a simple brown hat with a single feather, but it could vary in different villages. Most preferred ranged combat, avoiding bodily harm, using shortbows, slings, and darts. These militias were run by monks and clerics of local churches who supported them with their divine magics.\nLuiren owned very few warships, making defending of the countrys waters a task for hired human corsairs, paint in the percentage of trade profits from the naval routes.\nthumb|A 354x354px\nMany hin in Faerûn believed that Luiren was the Small Folks ancestral home, and their rich oral tradition supported that claim. However, their true origins were not known. Scholars who researched Luirens archeology were able to determine that Luiren nor other old hin communities were older than 12 centuries as of the 14 century DR. Halfling populations in Calimshan greatly predated the first evidence of Luirens existence.\nLuirens oral history, passed from generation to generation, talked about the founding of the hin nation long before the City of Song, Myth Drannor far to the north fell. Halflings were said to had arrived by the Hambone Bay to a wild forested land that bordered mountains populated by ogres. This first hin community was forced to regularly defend itself from ogres attacks. During that time, Kaldair Swiftfoot, later thought to be an avatar of Brandobaris, The Irrepressible Scamp, encountered an avatar of Vaprak, the Destroyer, an ogre deity. Kaldair led Vaprak on a ten-day-long chase across trap-filled woodlands. Subsequently, Vaprak collapsed exhausted, and Kaldair Swiftfoot proceeded to mock the lumbering avatar. Infuriated, Vaprak started throwing uprooted trees at Kaldair. This gave the nimble halfling an idea he challenged Vaprak to uproot a tree, not breaking a single root in the process. They bid on the forest that surrounded the land of the future Luiren. Vaprak went first and ripped a large tree out of the ground with its roots broken. Kaldair Swiftfoot, on his turn, pulled a young sapling out of the ground, gently revealing intact roots to the giant. Vaprak conceded and led his ogres away from the woods, leaving the country to the halflings. And so Luiren was founded. Or so a story went.\nOther historic accords claimed that halflings roamed the lands that would later become Luiren for thousands of years before falling into worshipping a dark deity Malar. In the , hin were said to had followed a ghostwise cleric Desva, adopting the deitys bloodthirsty ways. The worship allowed feral hunters to become werewolves that plague the Long Forest. In the , Chand, a strongheart halfling hunter chieftain made an alliance with the leaders of the lightfoots. Together, the tribes went to Hin Ghostwar against Malarites, and in the  Chand slew Desva. The bloody war resulted in the deaths and destruction of most of the ghostwise halflings. The survivors were exiled from Luiren.\nThe capital city of Beluir was founded in the ,\nLuirens subsequent history was ripe with conquests. Over the many centuries of its existence, Luiren was also conquered by Estagund and once by monstrous inhabitants of Veldorn. All the conquests had one thing in common conquerors always underestimated hin perseverance and natural knack for mischief. In the , halflings of Luiren were quickly enslaved by a fellow Shining South nation of Dambrath under the leadership of the warchief Reinhar I. Many hin were carried away while the rest of the nation retreated deep into their burrows and remained largely out of sight, waiting the conquerors out. In several years, in the  Dambrath abandoned Luiren, retreating back to defend their homes from cultists of Loviatar. Eventually, most slaves escaped captivity and returned home, while the rest remained within Dambrath, subsequently forging new lives there.\nSome of the older historic events in Luiren included a period of time, long before the 14 century DR, when the country was almost wiped out by a secret invasion of doppelganger, by some accords because halflings were too slow to work through their pastoral lives and secluded, quiet hamlets. It was said that Luiren ended up hiring mercenaries and wizards to eradicate the quiet invasion and save the nation.\nIn response to the tumult of numerous conquests, Luiren established the wardens by the . However, that could not stop the disaster of the , when Ammathtar was raised by a mysterious evil from the Southern Lluirwood – a beholder. In the , first hin started disappearing in the Southern Lluirwood, in reality – abducted and spirited away by the yuan-ti from the Black Jungles.\nIn the , another conquest was attempted, this time by the Crinti of Dambrath. But this time, the attack was thwarted by the hin marchwardens within three days of the conflict.\nThe  brought a fierce storm that battered the coastal cities of Beluir, Chethel, and Krenadir, leaving them heavily damaged. Yet another threat came in  when a monster attack led by druid Voolad Espiral ravaged Thruldar on the Luirens border with Estagund. The hin marchwardens and their ghostwise allies slew the evil druid and trapped his spirit within the ruined Thruldar.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Luiren was a flourishing prosperous nation that enriched itself thanks to trade with Durpar, the biggest importer of halflings goods. Through that relationship, Luiren sheltered itself from any potential conquest attempts by Dambrath.\nCirca the , Sir Ardent Raphiel of Ravens Bluff was put in touch with elders of Luiren with the help of the citys Wizard Guilds Dean of Conjuration, Jerrod Korbandor. Hous Raphiel extended a job offer to hin immigrants working in Raphiel farmlands, and by 1370 DR, several halfling families had already relocated to the Vast.\nIn events recent to the late 14 century DR, Luiren faced at least two major invasion attempts one by a pirate fleet that tried to plunder the nations coastal settlements, and the other came in the form of a normal army of Shaar. Both invasions were stopped through similar means, as a force of Halruaan mages appeared out of nowhere to destroy the invaders, only to disappear into thin air just as swiftly and unexpectedly. Another short-lived strife came when a priest of Umberlee sent a fiendish dire shark to attack coastal towns in Luiren that refused to pay tithe to the evil goddess of the seas.\nDuring the Spellplague in the , the entirety of Luiren was believed to be submerged in the Great Sea and was called the Gulf of Luiren.Canon sources do not provide a specific year for the creation of the Gulf of Luiren, and state only that it was created during the Spellplague (1385 DR–1395 DR). However, Brian R. James clarified in a [https//archive.ph/DVYFu Tweet] that the event occurred in 1386 DR. However, as it became known at a later date, halfling communities had survived as island redoubts. After the calamitous event ended, the waters began to recede, and the stories of the land of hin survival traveled north. The years during and after the flooding were tough for the nation. Many died during the century that followed the Spellplague. Even though Luiren largely recovered after the waters returned the nation to its former state, it still suffered from poor harvests from the salted soil across its once abundant farmlands. Firstly, hin were masters agrarians, and they healed the damage relatively fast secondly, the generous halfling culture knew how to work together in the face of adversity. By the late 15 century DR, Luirens halfling gradually decreased salt in the soil by planting crops that bound and absorbed excessive salt, regaining the countrys arable lands.\n*An old hin farmer folktale claimed that albino halflings were touched by the deity named Auril, The Queen of Cold and Frost, which sometimes led to albinos being ostracized by parts of rural hin communities.\n*Redcaps – evil fey creatures were known to inhabit the wilderness of Luiren. Halflings told fairytales that redcaps were hin who committed terrible crimes of betrayal and became cursed with murderous rage.\n*Isle of Quelthiir, a desolate island off the coast of the mainland.\n*Lluirwood, a dense forest that encompassed the northern border of Luiren.\n*Luirenstrand, or Hambone Bay, a bay in the Great Sea protected by the Isle of Quelthiir.\n*Mortick Swamp, the only large swamp in the region that was inhabited by merrow and scrags.\n*Southern Lluirwood, a forest making up the Luiren/Dambrath border.\n*Ammathluir, a trade hub city of mostly halfoles, famed for its woodcarvers, leatherworkers, and craftsmen.\n*Beluir, the capital of Luiren, a busy city of many overground buildings, halfoles, and inns accommodating to travelers and merchants. The city ran numerous farms and plantations. The capital was governed by mayor Calcitro Burrow in the late 14 century DR.\n*Chethel, one of Luirens most prolific mercantile cities that dealt in grains and fruit. The most comfortable city for visiting tall folk.\n*Crimel, a small city of woodworks ran by mayor Silvo Carver in the late 14 century DR.\n* Deepburrow, the hin town with access to the Underdark.\n*Fasruil, a quiet town of fertile farmlands and rhubarb harvests, run by the mayor Silari Carver in the late 14 century DR.\n*Krenadir, a humble city of populations that fluctuated every season, run by the mayor Hudkin Moadi in the late 14 century DR.\n*Shoun, a port town southeast of the Lluirwood that dealt in citrus trade, dairy, and baking goods, with the mayor being Melino Richtoes in the late 14 century DR.\n*Thruldar A ruined city that was inhabited by ghostwise halflings.\nLike in all other halfling communities, hin of Luiren consisted of three ethnic groups hairfeet, stouts, tallfellows, and a small number of ghostwise halflings. Within the halfling communities, this clarification was nothing but pedantry, and most halflings hand-waved the differences between the three or sages question about hairfeet being identified as the original racial stock of the Small Folk that dated back to the hin of ancient Calimshan. Halflings who were residing in Calimshan in the 14 century DR had some anthropological evidence that stouts had some dwarven blood, and tallfellows were said to have some elven ancestry. One notable trait among all Luiren hin were pointed ears. It was genetically recessive and was virtually nonexistent outside Luiren, bred out in the very next generation after leaving the southern lands of the hin.\nGnomes were a rare sight in Luiren. Toadstool Mountains were home to several humble dwarven communities, and the Lluirwood hid homes of some elves who had no interest in dealing with their halfling neighbors.\n*Hin Fist was monastic order from Luiren in the mid–14 and 15 centuries DR.\n*Keepers of the Vigilant Guardian, the defenders of hin communities, usually clerics or ranger-paladins dedicated to Arvoreen, The Vigilant Guardian.\n*Marchwardens, hin scouts of Luiren that kept watch over the ogre populations and prevented invasions from the Lluirwood and the Toadsquats. \n*Shields of Yondalla, a paladin order dedicated to Yondalla.\n*Siliss, the leader of a yuan-ti tribe from the Southern Lluirwood in the 14 century DR.\n*Xianthrope, the beholder of the Southern Lluirwoods forest citadel in the 14 century DR.\n* Burrows, the family from Beluir that owned the biggest plantation in the city and owned the Friendly Burrow, the Red Burrow, and the Cold Duck inns. \n*Sholapur, the family makers of the Luiren stout produced in Chethel.\n*Smokardin, the halfling clan responsible for brewing Luirens Best.\n*Binbollar Clambake, a halfling merchant of Luiren of some renown.\n*Foxilon Cardluck, a companion of Dwalimar Omen who left Luiren at a young age and eventually ended up aboard the Realms Master in the 14 century DR.\n*Gildmak Sholapur, the leader of the family that brewed the famed Luiren stout.\n*Kro Downybeard, the proprietor of Downybeard Tobacconist in Waterdeep in the late 14 century DR, was an immigrant from Lurien.\n*Nola Treestump, a priest of Sheela Peryroyl who lived not far from Crimel, defending the Lluirwood from evil in the 14 century DR.\n*Olive Ruskettle, a famous Harper agent and ally of the hero Alias of the Azure Bonds, claimed to had come from the land of Luiren sometime before the mid-14 century DR."
