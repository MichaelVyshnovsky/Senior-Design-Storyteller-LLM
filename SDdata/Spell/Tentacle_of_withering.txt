'''''Tentacle of withering''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Moander]], enabling them to transform one of their arms into a deadly tentacle.

==Effects==
This spell transformed one of the caster's arms into a rubbery grey tentacle. The caster could change the length of the appendage at will to a maximum length of {{SI|36|ft|long=yes}}. The tentacle could grasp surfaces and objects or be used to strike or constrict targets. The tentacle's withering power sucked life energy from targets that temporarily immobilized the touched area. The caster could not cast other spells while the spell was active.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a bone fragment or a small complete bone and a piece of [[rubber]] or [[eel]] flesh to cast.
