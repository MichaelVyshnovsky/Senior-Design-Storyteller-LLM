        "mainbody": "'''''Wonderform''''' was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] that disguised a mage as a [[wingless wonder]].",
        "Effects": "The caster was instantly transformed into a typically daft wingless wonder, with all the powers and limitations thereof.\n\nDespite possessing only tentacles and a beak-like mouth, the caster could cast any spell they had prepared, without requiring somatic or verbal components. Material components, although necessary, did not need to be produced; instead, they disappeared from within the caster's wonder body.\n\nMoreover, the caster's mind was shielded from all mental contact. Efforts to detect their alignment read them as [[chaotic neutral]] like any wonder.\n\nFor some reason, a caster could choose to remain as a wonder indefinitely, but they lost a little of their intelligence and wits after a year, and with every year thereafter. However, they could return to their natural form at will, or cast another shapechanging spell, but ''wonderform'' ended in either case.",
        "History": "''Wonderform'' was known to the mages of [[Netheril]]. When the empire fell in the [[-339 DR|Year of Sundered Webs, âˆ’339 DR]], many Netherese wizards escaped the collapse by using ''wonderform''. The spell remained known to [[human]] wizards by the 14{{th}} century DR.\n\n''Wonderform'' was later developed again independently by [[drow]] mages and was known to the drow of [[Menzoberranzan]] by the 14{{th}} century DR.",
        "Uses": "''Wonderform'' was a useful disguise for a wizard. Their mind was entirely shielded against scrutiny, appearing as a normal wonder in all physical and magical respects, and they could still speak and cast spells as normal. Thus someone who encountered a wonder could never tell if was a curious and helpless beast, or a powerful mage capable of mighty magic.\n\nDrow wizards regularly used ''wonderform'' as a disguise against hostile priestesses of [[Lolth]] or against surfacers unfamiliar with the [[Underdark]].",
