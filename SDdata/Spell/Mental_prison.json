        "mainbody": "'''''Mental prison''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that bound a creature within a cell of its own mind's creation.",
        "Effects": "The spell targeted a visible creature within a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}, inflicting damage to its mind. If unable to resist the spell, the target perceived the surrounding terrain as extremely dangerous, such as covered in fire, blades, or drooling maws, and could perceive nothing else but the illusion. The target remained confined to this prison for up to 1 minute, as long as the target kept concentrating. If the target attempted to touch or attack the illusory prison, the spell dissipated, inflicting copious damage to the creature's mind.\n\nCreatures who were immune to being [[charm]]ed could not be affected by this spell.",
        "Components": "The spell only required a [[somatic component]]."
