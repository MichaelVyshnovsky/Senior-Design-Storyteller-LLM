        "mainbody": "Dweomer vortex was a spell that was first developed by the phaerimms.\nWhen cast, the spell summoned a conical vortex in the air. The vortex was a cone  in length with a  wide opening. The vortex glimmered and floated freely in the air. The spell drained up to six spells from another creature. The vortex was immune to most spells cast against it, but a dispel magic spell caused the vortex to collapse. The spell had no affect on the effects of antimagic shell, globe of invulnerability and similar spells. The caster did not absorb the powers of a destroyed spell.\nThis spell required only a verbal component.\nThis spell was originally created by the phaerimm of Myth Drannor."
