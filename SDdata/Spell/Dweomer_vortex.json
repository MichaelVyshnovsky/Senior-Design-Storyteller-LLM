        "mainbody": "'''''Dweomer vortex''''' was a [[spell]] that was first developed by the [[phaerimm]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell summoned a conical vortex in the air. The vortex was a cone {{SI|10|ft}} in length with a {{SI|4|ft}} wide opening. The vortex glimmered and floated freely in the air. The spell drained up to six spells from another creature. The vortex was immune to most spells cast against it, but a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell caused the vortex to collapse. The spell had no affect on the effects of ''[[antimagic shell]]'', ''[[globe of invulnerability]]'' and similar spells. The caster did not absorb the powers of a destroyed spell.",
        "Components": "This spell required only a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component.",
        "History": "This spell was originally created by the [[phaerimm]] of [[Myth Drannor]]."
