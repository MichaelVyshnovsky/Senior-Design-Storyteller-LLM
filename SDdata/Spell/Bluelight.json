        "mainbody": "'''''Bluelight''''' was a personal [[cantrip]] that apprentice [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It created a sphere of light that softly illuminated the immediate surroundings.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this cantrip created a {{SIAdj|3|in|c|long=yes}} diameter sphere in the palm of the caster's hand that gave off a soft, blue radiance. The light reached only {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} away in all directions and did not reveal anything beyond that radius. Because of this, a viewer from far away was struck by an eerie sense that something was not right. ''Bluelight'' did not inhibit or hinder natural or magical [[infravision]] or [[Ultravision (spell)|ultravision]]. The glowing globe lasted as long as the caster maintained concentration on it.\n\nIf the caster held an [[alicorn]] when casting ''bluelight'', the sphere of light formed on the [[unicorn|unicorn's]] horn rather than his or her palm, and moved with the alicorn. The radiance continued to emit from the alicorn regardless of the distance between it and the caster, for as long as the caster maintained concentration.{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|35}}",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s. The caster extended an open palm and spoke a simple rhyme that included the words \"blue\" and \"light\". (\"Show me true, light of blue,\" for example.)",
        "History": "This cantrip was described on page three of ''[[Bowgentle's Book]]'', penned by the famous [[Bowgentle|mage from Silverymoon]].{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|30}}<ref group=\"note\">The three cantrips described in [[Dragon magazine 97|''Dragon'' #97]] were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''."
