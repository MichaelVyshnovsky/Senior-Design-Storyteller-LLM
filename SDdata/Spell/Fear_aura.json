        "mainbody": "Fear aura was a very rare spell.\nWhen cast, this spell caused all creatures within  who looked at the caster to be stricken with terror. The terrified creatures would either flee the area or become immobilized in fear. Creatures who were either stronger than the caster, had a natural immunity to fear, or were mindless were not affected by this spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component a piece of cloth cut from the shroud of a lich.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
