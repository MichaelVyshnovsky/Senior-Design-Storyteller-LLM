Corrupt was a divine alteration and necromancy spell used by priests devoted to Myrkul, enabling them to create weaknesses in substances.
This spell allowed the caster to create weak spots in armor or solid surfaces, contaminate water, and generally modify substances with a harmful effect. Corrupt would weaken healing potions, negate holy water, strengthen unholy water, and temporarily disable other magic items for several minutes. The caster could affect one selected target with each casting of this spell. This spell could be cast by several priests to greatly enhance the corruption it wrought. Furthermore, a single priest could cast the spell on the same location multiple times to achieve greater results over time.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
