        "mainbody": "Nybors joyful voyage was an arcane spell that teleported an individual a number of miles in a random direction.\nUpon casting, this spell instantaneously transported its target anywhere from one to 100 miles in a random direction, from west, north, east, south, or anywhere in between, as well as diagonally or straight up or down. The latter two possible destinations could place them a deep within Toril, embedded in solid stone, falling from the sky or even within the nearest reaches of realmspace.\nThe spell was invented by the 13 century Red Wizard, Zulkir Nybor, and the \"joy\" in the spells name referred to that felt by the spellcaster upon seeing the effects of their magic."
