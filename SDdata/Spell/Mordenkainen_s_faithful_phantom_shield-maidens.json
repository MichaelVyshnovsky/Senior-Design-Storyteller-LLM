        "mainbody": "'''''Mordenkainen's faithful phantom shield-maidens''''' was an uncommon [[spell]] which summoned a pair of spectral guardians.",
        "Effects": "With this spell, the caster was able to summon a pair of phantom shield-maidens to their side. The shield-maidens protected the caster from all enemies within {{SI|50|yd}} of the caster. They remained close to the caster so their two shields could provide cover. They always remained within {{SI|50|ft}} of the caster, even if ordered to go farther by the caster.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s, a small figure of the caster made from wood with a pair of shields made from crystal tied to it."
