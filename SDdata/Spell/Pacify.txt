Pacify was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
This spell pacified creatures within the spells area of effect. Once cast, harmful spells and weapons were unable to be used, and creatures could not physically impede other creatures. If a pacified creature was attacked by another creature who was not affected by the spell, the spell on the targeted creature was lifted.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components. During casting, the shugenja uttered several sutras.
