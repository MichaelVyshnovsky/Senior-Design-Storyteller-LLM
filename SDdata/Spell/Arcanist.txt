'''Arcanists''', also referred to as '''Netherese arcanists''', The title "arcanist" was synonymous with the word "[[wizard]]", in the centuries that followed the [[Karsus's Folly|fall of the empire]].

In the long past days of [[Netheril]], practitioners of [[the Art]] once were able to bend arcane powers in ways few those in later centuries could match. A small number of people from the time of Netheril, a few [[lich]]es, [[Larloch]] being the most well known, and some of the [[Princes of Shade]] from [[Thultanthar]], are direct survivors of that fallen empire. Some few others have researched the past thoroughly enough that they have uncovered the secrets of the ancient Netherese.

==Culture==
The Netherese culture was extravagant, wasteful, and decadent. Magic was plentiful and nearly everyone could wield it to some extent. Arcanists were the elite spellcasters in society and were looked to for the defense, prowess, and prosperity of Netheril. The most powerful arcanists were known as [[archwizard]]s.

Arcanists were arrogant in general and looked upon [[divine magic]] with utter disdain because they felt they were on a path to godhood, and to accept healing or aid from a priest was to forfeit their chance at becoming a deity themselves. Thus, arcanists of this stripe relied heavily on ''[[potion of healing|potions of healing]]'' and other arcane forms of healing and life preservation.

==Abilities==
The Netherese arcanists achieved the highest level of magical ability ever wielded by mortals. Indeed, one archwizard, [[Karsus]], actually promoted himself to godhood for a very brief moment by stealing the power of [[Mystryl]], the Mother of All Magic, in the [[-339 DR|Year of Sundered Webs, &ndash;339 DR]]. While this extreme act of hubris resulted in the death of the goddess, the destruction of Netheril, and the eternal prohibition of the greatest magics from mortal minds, it was nevertheless a testimony to the incredible abilities achieved by the Netherese arcanists and archwizards.

They were particularly adept at developing new magical items and spells, and were focused spellcasters who were seldom damaged by the backlash of their own magic.

Their study of magic was divided up into three specializations. Every arcanist chose a major and a minor specialization and was barred from the third. The three specialized forms were [[inventive]], [[mentalism]], and [[variation]]. An Inventor created or destroyed matter and material things; a Mentalist operated in the arena of the mind; a Variator altered existing objects, materials, and even magic itself.

==Relationships==
The Netherese thought they were the chosen race among humans and this tainted their view of all other races.

In general, the Netherese had a good relationship with the [[dwarves]] of [[Delzoun]], trading magic items and inventions for [[gem]]s, precious metals, weapons, and crafted stonework.

Relations with the [[elves]] of [[Cormanthyr]] started out cordially, when they befriended the early Netherese settlers and taught them about magic. As the power and arrogance of the arcanists grew, the elves began to distance themselves from what they saw as an ostentatious, oafish, and reckless group of spellcasters. [[Gnomes]] were used as slave labor by the early Netherese but eventually won their independence by going on strike and refusing to work. After their release, many of the former slaves fled south, migrating far away from their insensitive former masters.

[[Half-elves]] were treated as second class citizens by the Netherese, reinforcing the notion that they didn't belong with either humans or elves. They were allowed to mingle if they had magical ability, but were relegated to the less wealthy districts and earned less than humans doing the same jobs. [[Halfling]]s had much the same relationship to the Netherese as the half-elves. [[Humanoid]]s such as [[orcs]] were usually killed on sight.

==Possessions==
Arcanists created many [[quasi-magical]] items that only functioned while in the vicinity of a ''[[mythallar]]'', the magical engine that powered their floating cities. Few arcanists desired to leave the safety and comfort of their enclaves; nevertheless, some magic items were created either before the mythallar was invented or by "eccentric" individuals that were brave enough to venture out of the nest.

Some of these rare items were:
*''[[Chardalyn]]'': A black rock that could hold a spell and be released when needed.
*''[[Congenio's pebbles]]'' : Later referred to as [[Ioun stone]]s.
*[[Halavar|Halavar's]] ''[[Universal pantograph]]'' : A small box that could duplicate nearly anything non-magical, including cloning creatures (or people if they could be shrunk to fit in the box).
*''[[Lefeber's Enchanter]]'' : A rod that imbued items with the ability to store spells.
*''[[Netherpelter]]'' : A magical blowgun with a variety of ammunition effects.
*''[[Skimmer]]'' : A small boat propelled by an [[air elemental]].
*''[[Storm star]]'' : A magic [[morning star]] that could release a version of ''[[chain lightning]]'' when it hit.
