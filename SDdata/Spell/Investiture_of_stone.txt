Investiture of stone was a transmutation spell that covered the caster in pieces of protective rock, while also conferring the ability to burrow through stone and earth and to create small earthquakes.
The spell caused pieces of rock to spread around the casters body for up to 10 minutes, as long as the caster kept concentrating. The rocks rendered the caster resistant to all forms of physical non-magical attacks. The caster also became capable of easily traversing irregular rocky ground and could cross solid earth or stone as if they were air. However, one had to be careful not to spend too much time within a solid volume, at the risk of being violently ejected from it. Additionally, the spell could create small earthquakes that, although harmless, were capable of knocking down creatures as far as  away.
The spell only required verbal and somatic components.
