}}'''''Bladeleap''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] used on bladed weapons.''

==Effects==
This spell caused a bladed weapon to spring from their hand to strike a target of their choice. The caster did not need to be skilled with the weapon used for this spell.

This spell could only be used for a single attack with the weapon. Once the blade left the caster's hand it did not return on its own, nor was it consumed by the spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a weapon and either a hair from the caster or a thread from their clothing to cast.
