Bladeleap was a wizard spell used on bladed weapons.
This spell caused a bladed weapon to spring from their hand to strike a target of their choice. The caster did not need to be skilled with the weapon used for this spell.
This spell could only be used for a single attack with the weapon. Once the blade left the casters hand it did not return on its own, nor was it consumed by the spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a weapon and either a hair from the caster or a thread from their clothing to cast.
