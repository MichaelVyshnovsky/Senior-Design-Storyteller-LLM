Robe of healing was a special enchantment and necromancy quest spell.
When cast, this spell enchanted the cloak or robe of the caster. The now-enchanted cloak or robe allowed the caster to walk among wounded creatures, healing as they touched the cloak or robe. Over a thousand creatures could be cured by means of this spell before it expired. A creature could be healed by this spell once per week.
The spell was available to clerics of Karsus.
