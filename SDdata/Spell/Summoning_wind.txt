Summoning wind was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
A wu jen used this spell to communicate important messages to one or several creatures. The message could carry up to 25 words. While the wu jen was not required to know the identity of the recipients, they needed to know some sort of common identifier, such as location. The spell had no range a wu jen could send a message across great distances.
This spell required verbal and somatic components.
