This spell was only usable by wizards.\nWith this spell the caster or target would not get wet from fresh water or saltwater only. This spell had no effect on creatures from the Elemental Plane of Water and did not prevent drowning. Once cast, this spell lasted for one full day.\nThis spell required a bit of wax and some paper to cast."
