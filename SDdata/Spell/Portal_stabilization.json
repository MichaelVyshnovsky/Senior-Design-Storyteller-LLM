        "mainbody": "'''''Portal stabilization''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that stabilized a [[magic]]al ''[[portal]]''.",
        "Effects": "''Portals'', those older than a century in particular, were susceptible to malfunction due to exposure to global magical catastrophes and simple wear. The ''portal stabilization'' spell made the usage of such malfunctioning ''portals'' safer to a degree. The level at which it stabilized was such that it could merely not work at all or send a person to the wrong place, but not necessarily hurt the user.",
        "Components": "''Portal stabilization'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s as well as a [[divine focus]]."
