The curse of forgetfulness was an enchantment curse that removed the ability of a spellcaster to comprehend certain spells. The reverse of the spell, bestow remembrance, allowed someone to regain understanding of spells they previously lost, such as by this curse or the spell forget.
A spellcaster who was affected by this curse lost all capabilities to memorize, scribe or even cast a specific spell, even if they possessed a scroll on which it was inscribed. When the curse of forgetfulness was cast, the understanding of a single spell, chosen at random from among their memorized repertoire, was completely removed from the cursed individuals mind. Every tenday thereafter, another spell was affected in this same manner, a process that repeated until they lost all spellcasting capabilities.
The effects of this curse could not be undone by the spell remove curse, but could be remedied by heal, limited wish or similarly powerful magic. While it was not commonly known, the ingestion of an undiluted potion of sweet water stopped the progression of the curse, but could not reverse its effects.
This spell required verbal and somatic components to be cast.
