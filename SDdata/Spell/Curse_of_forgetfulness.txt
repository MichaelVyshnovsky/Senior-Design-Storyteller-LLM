The '''''curse of forgetfulness''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[curse]] that removed the ability of a [[spellcaster]] to comprehend certain [[spell]]s. The reverse of the spell, '''''bestow remembrance''''', allowed someone to regain understanding of spells they previously lost, such as by this curse or the spell ''[[forget]]''.

==Effects==
A spellcaster who was affected by this curse lost all capabilities to memorize, scribe or even cast a specific spell, even if they possessed a ''[[scroll]]'' on which it was inscribed. When the ''curse of forgetfulness'' was cast, the understanding of a single spell, chosen at random from among their memorized repertoire, was completely removed from the cursed individual's mind. Every [[tenday]] thereafter, another spell was affected in this same manner, a process that repeated until they lost all spellcasting capabilities.

The effects of this curse could not be undone by the spell ''[[remove curse]]'', but could be remedied by ''[[heal]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'' or similarly powerful magic. While it was not commonly known, the ingestion of an undiluted ''[[potion of sweet water]]'' stopped the progression of the curse, but could not reverse its effects.

==Components==
This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to be cast.
