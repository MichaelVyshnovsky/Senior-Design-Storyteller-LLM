        "Effects": "On casting, the spell created a {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} wide by {{SI|15|feet|long=yes}} tall gate in midair, which led to a temporary [[demiplane]] furnished in the colors of the caster's faith, whose floor space could reach up to, at least, {{SI|8500|sq ft|long=yes}}; the demiplane endured for at least 17 days. Only those the caster designated could enter, and the entrance was made invisible behind them until the caster chose to reveal or open it again. The spell allowed for any temperature between 40 and 90 Fahrenheit, and lighting was controllable too. There was enough food inside for at least 204 people under normal circumstances, but stronger casters might well reach 240 people without straining credulity. Anyone who spent at least an hour eating inside the pavilion was affected as if by ''[[heroes' feast]]'', and all healing proceeded at double normal rate.",
        "Components": "The spell called for [[verbal component]]s, [[somatic component]]s, and the caster's own [[holy symbol]]."
