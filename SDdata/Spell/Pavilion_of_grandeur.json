        "mainbody": "True creation was a powerful spell that created a refuge for at over two hundred people.\nOn casting, the spell created a  wide by  tall gate in midair, which led to a temporary demiplane furnished in the colors of the casters faith, whose floor space could reach up to, at least,  the demiplane endured for at least 17 days. Only those the caster designated could enter, and the entrance was made invisible behind them until the caster chose to reveal or open it again. The spell allowed for any temperature between 40 and 90 Fahrenheit, and lighting was controllable too. There was enough food inside for at least 204 people under normal circumstances, but stronger casters might well reach 240 people without straining credulity. Anyone who spent at least an hour eating inside the pavilion was affected as if by heroes feast, and all healing proceeded at double normal rate.\nThe spell called for verbal components, somatic components, and the casters own holy symbol."
