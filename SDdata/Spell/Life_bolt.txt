Life bolt was a spell used by sorcerers and wizards.
When cast, this spell created a beam of positive energy from the life force of the caster. The caster could target a single or multiple creatures. If the caster was attacking multiple targets, they had to be no more than  apart. The amount of beams the caster could create was determined by their skill level.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
This spell was invented by Stavros of the Skulls, the Cyricist necromancer, as a result of an incident involving losing control of zombies. At the order of the Lords Court of Waterdeep, he was ordered to create and develop four beneficial spells of the necromantic school or be forced to return to the bowels of Undermountain, a place from which he had just returned three months prior. He complied, and and this spell was one of the four he gave to the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors.
Melegost Starseer, a Magister of Mystra, once described this spell as an ideal spell which represented the values of the goddess herself.
