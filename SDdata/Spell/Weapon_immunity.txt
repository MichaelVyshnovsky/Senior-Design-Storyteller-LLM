'''''Weapon immunity''''' was a [[Protection sphere|protection]] spell of the [[southern magic]] tradition that granted the caster immunity to a specific type of weapon for a short time.{{Southernmagic}}

==Effects==
For a few minutes (longer for more experienced casters), the caster became immune to damage from a specific type of weapon such as all [[longsword]]s. This protection included magical versions of those weapons, but not other distinct types (''e.g.'', not [[bastard sword]]s or [[short sword]]s). This spell did not function on natural weapons such as fists, claws, or fangs. Only one ''weapon immunity'' could be active at a time.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a piece of either [[amethyst]], [[jade]] or [[lapis lazuli]] to cast.
