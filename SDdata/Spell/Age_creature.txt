When cast, the spell increased the natural age of a targeted creature. The amount of years the creature aged was determined by the caster's skill level. The spell could not increase the age of a targeted creature beyond their natural lifespan.

The spell changed the appearance of both [[human]]s and [[humanoid]]s, causing hair to grey and skin to wrinkle. They also suffered from a lose of agility, strength and stamina.

The reverse of this spell was '''''restore youth'''''. It permanently restored the natural age of an individual who has suffered increased aging as a result of a magical effect. The amount of years the spell restored was determined by the caster's skill level. The spell did not reverse any aging effects as a result of ''[[wish]]'' or ''[[haste]]''. The spell could not make a targeted creature younger than their actual age.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], a small amount of [[emerald]] dust, while ''restore youth'' required a small amount of [[ruby]] dust.

==History==
This spell was inscribed within the [[Kelemvor]]ite [[relic]] the ''[[Testament of Vraer]]''. and in ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy text of the [[church of Mielikki]].<ref>
