        "mainbody": "'''''Sentry of Helm''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Helm]], enabling them to aid in guard duty.",
        "Effects": "This spell created a shapeless face that assisted in guard duty while others were sleeping. The caster sprinkled sand around a {{SIAdj|120|ft|long=yes|adj=long}} perimeter while casting this spell then promptly fell asleep. The conjured sentry would wake the caster if any visible object not present when the spell was cast larger than {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in length crossed the perimeter. This would also end the spell, but the caster would awaken alert and knowledgeable that something had crossed the perimeter. Sentries conjured by a caster with a degree of skill also had [[infravision]] to aid them.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a small bag of fine [[sand]] to cast.",
        "History": "In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, [[Chief Prelate]] [[Relarn Dayspring|Dayspring]] of the [[Clerical Circle]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] declared it illegal for priests to cast ''Sentry of Helm'' within the city due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]], threatening arrest for those that broke this decree.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}"
