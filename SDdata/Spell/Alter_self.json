The new feature was a magical weapon ''+1''.\nThis version of the spell lasted while the caster maintained concentration, for up to one hour. During that time, the caster could choose a new variation at will. A wizard could duck into an alley and ''change appearance'' to resemble a [[barbarian]], then jump in a river and use ''aquatic adaptation'' to swim away. While in combat, a change could be effected every six seconds but only movement and no attacks were possible while the change took place."
