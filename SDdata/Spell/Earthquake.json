        "mainbody": "Earthquake was an evocation or alteration spell that unleashed a powerful but localized tremor.\nThe effect of the tremor depended on the type of terrain it was cast in, so a cavern would collapse and damage those caught in the collapse where heavily damaged. Areas with structures or woods would cause damage to the structures and trees, and a swamp would have its water drained.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The materials required were a pinch of dust, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay."
