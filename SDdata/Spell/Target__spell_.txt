Target was an arcane southern magic spell from the school of alteration used by wizards that allowed them to mark a target for ranged weapons.
Once marked by the target spell, any missile weapons fired at the victim stood a greater chance of hitting and harming the victim. The spell lasted for several minutes depending on the skill of the caster.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
This was a southern magic spell used within the Old Empires region of Faer√ªn.
