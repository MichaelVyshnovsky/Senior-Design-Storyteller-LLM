A casting of Mavins earthfast made large areas of underground tunnels impervious to cave-ins and similar disasters. Its use was later adapted to preserve important areas of cities.\nThe components needed for this spell were a stone of controlling earth elementals, six chardalyns (each imbued with transmute mud to rock), and an earth elemental.\nThe spell was created by Mavin around  (3349 NY). However, after the near-cataclysmic destruction of the Weave caused by the casting of Karsuss avatar in  (3520 NY) and the subsequent restrictions placed on magic by Mystra, the spell could no longer be cast. Later ages remembered the spell simply as earthfast.\nCategoryAlteration spells\nCategoryInventives\nCategoryVariations\nCategoryEpic spells\nCategoryMavins spells\nCategoryWizard spells\np9yldqti3zou7yfqwknhuqkjk4vx9zl"
