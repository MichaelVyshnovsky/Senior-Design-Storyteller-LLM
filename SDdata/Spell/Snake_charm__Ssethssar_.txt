Snake charm was a divine enchantment spell used by priests devoted to Sseth.
With this spell the caster could stare into the eyes of a single creature and hypnotize them while swaying their head back and forth. A victim of this spell could only stare helplessly at the caster. They would remain in this stupor until physically attacked or shaken. They could move about slowly at half their normal speed.
Snake charm had no effect on undead.
This spell required only somatic components to cast.
