        "mainbody": "'''''Thief's lament''''' was an [[alteration]] spell that protected an area by making it difficult for thieves to practice their trade.",
        "Effects": "Unless a thief was able to resist ''theif's lament'', most of the abilities thieves were known for were made much more difficult by this spell. Specifically, picking pockets, hiding in shadows, moving silently, finding and removing traps, climbing walls, opening locks, and even detecting noise were all adversely effected.\n\nPriests could protect an area equal to a cube whose sides were 5 ft (1.5 m) times the level of the caster.",
        "Components": "Verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell, plus the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a [[silver]] key.",
