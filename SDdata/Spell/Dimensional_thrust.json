        "mainbody": "Dimensional thrust was an alteration spell that allowed a mage to transport another being across a certain distance of space.\nWhen the spell was cast, the affected creature was safely teleported a significant distance, up to 450 feet (137.2 meters) away in the direction of the casters choosing. If the creature was being moved against their will, there was a chance the spell could fail.\nWhile the transportation was in and of itself inherently safe, it was possibly for the caster to use the spell to place a creature atop a trap or other dangerous locale.\nThe casting of this spell required only a somatic component."
