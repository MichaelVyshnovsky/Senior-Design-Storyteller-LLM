        "mainbody": "'''''Dimensional thrust''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[mage]] to transport another being across a certain distance of space.",
        "Effects": "When the spell was cast, the affected creature was safely teleported a significant distance, up to 450 feet (137.2 meters) away in the direction of the caster's choosing. If the creature was being moved against their will, there was a chance the spell could fail.\n\nWhile the transportation was in and of itself inherently safe, it was possibly for the caster to use the spell to place a creature atop a trap or other dangerous locale.",
        "Components": "The casting of this spell required only a [[somatic component]]."
