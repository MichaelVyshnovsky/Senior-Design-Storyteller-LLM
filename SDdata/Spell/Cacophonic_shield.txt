Cacophonic shield was a defensive spell.
When cast, the spell created a barrier of sound  from the caster. The barrier gave off a faint buzzing sound. The barrier prevented sonic-based spells and effects from reaching those on the other side. If a creature physically walked through the barrier they suffered from sonic damage. Any missile or projectile that was shot through the barrier in either direction had a chance of missing their target.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
