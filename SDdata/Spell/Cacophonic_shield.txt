'''''Cacophonic shield''''' was a defensive [[spell]].

==Effects==
When cast, the spell created a barrier of sound {{SI|10|ft}} from the caster. The barrier gave off a faint buzzing sound. The barrier prevented sonic-based spells and effects from reaching those on the other side. If a creature physically walked through the barrier they suffered from sonic damage. Any missile or projectile that was shot through the barrier in either direction had a chance of missing their target.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
