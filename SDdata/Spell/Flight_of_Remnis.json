        "mainbody": "'''''Flight of Remnis''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell given to priests of [[Aerdrie Faenya]]. It called many birds of prey to the aid of the caster.",
        "Effects": "This spell was similar to ''[[animal summoning I]]'' in that a maximum quota of animals could be called,<ref group=\"note\">The quota was determined by the level of the summoning, and once the quota was filled, no more animals appeared. Generally, the size of the animal determined how much of the quota they filled, with larger animals counting more toward the quota than smaller ones. but for this spell, the caster could only make one call (as opposed to three for ''animal summoning I'') and could not choose the species of animal to summon. All [[natural creature|natural]] raptors and carnivorous birds within a {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} radius were subject to being summoned, but this spell brought the largest creatures first, with preference given to [[giant eagle]]s and then [[eagle]]s, followed by all other birds of prey from largest to smallest, until the quota was filled or there were no more candidates in the area. If giant eagles answered the call, then this spell had a quota equivalent to ''[[animal summoning II]]''.\n\nThe birds of prey assisted the caster by whatever means they could, for example, joining a fight, finishing a task, seeing the caster was safe, or until the caster dismissed them.",
        "Components": "Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were required to cast this spell.",
        "Trivia": "This spell was named for the deity [[Remnis]], the patron god of giant eagles<ref><ref> and an ally of Aerdrie Faenya."
