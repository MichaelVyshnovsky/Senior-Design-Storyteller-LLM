        "mainbody": "'''''Dispel exhaustion''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[illusion]] [[spell]] that convinced others that they were well-rested.",
        "Effects": "This spell affected up to four targets at once, allowing them to attack and move as if under the influence of the ''[[haste]]'' spell for one minute every ten minutes. This spell also temporarily healed half of any physical harm experienced before the spell was cast. This recovered health was lost before the target's actual health if the targets were harmed while the spell was active.\n\nA second casting of ''dispel exhaustion'' on a target already under the influence of the same spell would negate both spells.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.",
        "History": "This spell was found within ''[[Selvar's Ineffable Conjurations, Magicks, and Phantasms]]."
