Spiritwrack was a powerful spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur and mages across the planes.
A wu jen used this spell against creatures of the lower planes. The wu jen had to know the name of the target creature. The spell inflicted incredible pain on the target creature, and was often used to force the creature to submit to another request. A wu jen became the sworn enemy of the target creature after this spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component in the form of a sheet of vellum with the name of the target creature written on it. The ink used was a blend of tanarri ichor and powdered rubies. The ink used in this spell was very expensive, as the rubies had to be worth at least 5,000 gold pieces.
The spiritwrack spell was originally developed in the Outer Planes that leaned towards lawful alignment.
This spell was especially popular among people on the plane of Acheron.
