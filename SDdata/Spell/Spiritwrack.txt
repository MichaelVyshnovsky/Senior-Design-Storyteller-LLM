'''''Spiritwrack''''' was a powerful [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]] and [[mage]]s across the [[plane]]s.

==Effects==
A wu jen used this spell against creatures of the [[lower planes]]. The wu jen had to know the name of the target creature. The spell inflicted incredible pain on the target creature, and was often used to force the creature to submit to another request. A wu jen became the sworn enemy of the target creature after this spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]] in the form of a sheet of [[vellum]] with the name of the target creature written on it. The [[ink]] used was a blend of [[demon ichor|tanar'ri ichor]] and powdered [[rubies]]. The ink used in this spell was very expensive, as the rubies had to be worth at least 5,000 [[gold piece]]s.

==History==
The ''spiritwrack'' spell was originally developed in the [[Outer Planes]] that leaned towards [[law]]ful [[alignment]].

==Notable Users==
This spell was especially popular among people on the plane of [[Acheron]].
