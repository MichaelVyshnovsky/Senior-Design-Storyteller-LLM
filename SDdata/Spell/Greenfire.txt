'''''Greenfire''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that drew forth acidic green energy from [[Toril]].

==Effects==
The virulent energy evoked by the caster was extremely harmful to any creatures caught within the spell's area of effect. While it was possible to evade the upwelling of energy, those who entered into the blast were not so lucky. If the caster wished, they could render the spell completely innocuous to natural vegetation and intelligent [[Plant creature|plant life]].

==Casting==
This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s as well as the use of a [[divine focus]].
