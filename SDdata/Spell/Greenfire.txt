Greenfire was an evocation spell that drew forth acidic green energy from Toril.
The virulent energy evoked by the caster was extremely harmful to any creatures caught within the spells area of effect. While it was possible to evade the upwelling of energy, those who entered into the blast were not so lucky. If the caster wished, they could render the spell completely innocuous to natural vegetation and intelligent plant life.
This spell required verbal and somatic components as well as the use of a divine focus.
