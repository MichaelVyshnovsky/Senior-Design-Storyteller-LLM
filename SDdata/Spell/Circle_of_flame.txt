}}'''''Circle of flame''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] focused on fire effects.

==Effects==
This spell created a ring of flames surrounding the caster. The ring could be up to 10 feet thick and up to 20 feet tall. The caster was unable to "seal" the top of the ring to create a sphere. The ring did not move once cast, and while the caster and their belongings were immune to the flames, any other creature could be harmed by contact with them. If a creature charged through the flames they would actually be burned twiceâ€”once when entering the ring and again when exiting the other side. The surface upon which the ring of flames rested was not affected by the fire, but anything above the ring could be damaged.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a flint and piece of ash from a fire to cast.
