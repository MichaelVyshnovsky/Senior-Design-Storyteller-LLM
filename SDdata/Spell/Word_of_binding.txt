Word of binding was a divine divination spell that allowed a cleric to prevent others from passing through a doorway or accessing a barred container.
When cast, this spell closed and "locked" any door, lock, set of shutters, or even a cupboard, and prevented anyone but the caster from opening it.
If the caster wished, they could exempt Oghman clergy from the effects of word of binding and grant them full access to any object affected by the spell.
The specifications of this spell could be revealed upon a surface by the Oghman relic, the Key of Faith.
This spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast.
