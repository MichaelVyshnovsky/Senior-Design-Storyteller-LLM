        "mainbody": "See invisibility, or detect invisibility, was a divination spell that allowed the caster to see invisible or ethereal creatures and objects.\nWhen cast, the spellcasters eyes could see invisible and ethereal things as translucent shapes for a distance as far as he or she could normally see. It was easy to determine which things were visible as opposed to invisible while under the effects of the spell.\nThe spell did not provide any information about whether the invisibility was the result of a spell or of some supernatural quality. It did not permit the caster to see through other opaque objects. Someone or something hidden in a natural manner was not revealed by this spell.\nThe ability provided lasted at least a half hour and longer if cast by a more powerful spellcaster. The effect could also be made permanent.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components, a pinch of talc, and a tiny sprinkling of powdered silver.\nThis spell was originally developed by Netherese arcanist Trebbe in  under the name Trebbes scry invisibility.\nSome creatures had an innate ability similar to see invisibility, such as helmed horrors, jade spiders, and marids."
