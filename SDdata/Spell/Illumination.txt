Illumination was an Amaunatori spell.
On casting Illumination, the caster was surrounded by golden light. In this state, the caster was not affected by any magic that did not involve cold, darkness, or shadow.
How long this state persisted depended on perspective for the flow of time was altered. For the caster, the spell took seven minutes to end, for all others, the spells duration was merely a minute. During those seven minutes, the caster could do nothing. He or she could not cast other spells, turn invisible, simply move, or do anything else except for asking up to seven yes-or-no questions to his or her deity. The deity, apart from answering "yes, "no", and "I dont know", could give answers that would help the caster make decisions and were also tailored to furthering its own agenda.
Another way to use illumination was to convert its power into a one-shot cure blindness or deafness, cure disease, prayer, or free action or up to four cure light wounds all on the caster him- or herself, instead of asking questions. Doing this ended the spell. 
Illumination required verbal and material components in the form of a holy symbol and holy water.
