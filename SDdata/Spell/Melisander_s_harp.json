        "Effects": "This spell created an [[illusion]] of a shadowy [[harp]]. The harp floated in mid-air and could play itself and be moved or repositioned by the caster.\n\nAny creatures within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} of the harp were automatically affected by its music as if they were under the influence of a ''[[slow]]'' spell. In addition to this, they risked being put to ''[[sleep]]'' by the harp. The harp's music also diminished other sounds and dimmed available light. Creatures within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of the harp were automatically under the effects of a ''[[feather fall]]'' spell.\n\n''[[Dispel magic]]'' or spells causing magical silence had no effect on the harp. The harp could not be moved through a magical barrier, nor could its music penetrate such barriers.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a [[silver]] harp string and three tears to cast."
