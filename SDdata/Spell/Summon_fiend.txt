'''''Summon fiend''''' was a rare spell used by evil [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
This spell was incredibly dangerous and a caster used it at their own risk. It summoned a [[fiend]] to the [[Prime Material Plane]] to the caster, who had some control over it. The caster could summon any [[baatezu]], [[tanar'ri]], or [[yugoloth]], as well as fiend-like creatures such as [[barghest]]s. The targeted fiend was able to ignore the summons. The caster had to maintain constant concentration to control the summoned fiend. If the caster lost focus, the spell instantly expired and the fiend returned to its [[plane]].

The summoned fiend could be used in combat against the caster's opponents, using their spells and magical abilities. They could also be assigned tasks to perform by the caster. The caster had to be explicit in describing the parameters of the task, as the fiend would always try to interpret the directions in a way to bring harm to the caster. If the fiend had a greater intelligence than the caster, it could force the caster to perform a task for them at a later date, or simply capture the caster and drag them back to their home plane to become a slave or a meal.

A caster could protect themselves by casting a ''[[protection from evil]]'' spell beforehand or igniting a special candle that was crafted from rare materials. This spell was used by evil-aligned casters and performing such a spell was considered an evil act in itself. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a stone or a handful of dirt from the plane of the targeted fiend. The post-[[Second Sundering]] version of the spell required instead a portion of [[humanoid]] blood contained in a [[ruby]] [[vial]].
