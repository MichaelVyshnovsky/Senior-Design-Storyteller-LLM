        "mainbody": "Magnetism was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nIf a wu jen cast this spell on themself, ferromagnetic materials such as iron, steel and nickel were drawn to the wu jens hand. The material had to be within 60 yards (54 meters) from the wu jen. Wu jen often used this spell to wrest weapons from an opponents hands. If a wu jen tried to attract a material with greater mass than the wu jen, then the spell had the opposite effect, with the wu jen drawn to the heavy material.  \nIf a wu jen cast this spell on another creature, any ferromagnetic materials within 30 feet (9 meters) from the creature were drawn to them. If the material had a greater mass than the creature, the creature was then drawn to the material.  \nThe reverse of the spell was demagnetize. This spell completely cancelled the effects of the magnetism spell.\nMore experienced casters could cast a superior version of this spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a piece of lodestone, while demagnetize required a small rod made of wood."
