'''''Sprout''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that neophyte [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It caused live seeds or plants to experience an immediate growth spurt, or caused vegetable matter to ripen or age.

==Effects==
The target of this spell had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster and affected plant matter in a volume no bigger than {{SI|1|cu yd|long=yes}}. This cantrip accelerated the growth of plants. Seeds sprouted to seedlings, seedlings grew about {{SI|1|in|c|long=yes}}, flower buds bloomed, and so on. If used on fruit or vegetables, they aged, advancing from unripe toward ripe, or possibly overripe to spoiled.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster pantomimed hoeing while making a whispery rustling sound.
