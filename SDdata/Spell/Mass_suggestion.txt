Mass suggestion was an enchantment spell that could compel multiple people to perform a course of action dictated by the caster.
When casting the spell, the caster could choose up to 12 targets and suggest in one or two sentences a course of action. If the action did not involve any obvious self-harm, targets that could not resist the effects of the spell were compelled to perform the task for 24 hours (or until the task was completed), or longer in more powerful castings of the spell.
The spell required verbal and material components. The materials required were a snakes tongue and either a drop of oil or a piece of honeycomb.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Hamring in  and was originally called Hamrings mass hypnosis.
