'''''Mass suggestion''''' was an [[enchantment]] spell that could compel multiple people to perform a course of action dictated by the caster.

==Effects==
When casting the spell, the caster could choose up to 12 targets and suggest in one or two sentences a course of action. If the action did not involve any obvious self-harm, targets that could not resist the effects of the spell were compelled to perform the task for 24 hours (or until the task was completed), or longer in more powerful castings of the spell.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and material components. The materials required were a [[snake]]'s tongue and either a drop of [[oil]] or a piece of honeycomb.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Hamring]] in {{Yearlink|-1293}} and was originally called '''''Hamring's mass hypnosis'''''.
