        "mainbody": "'''''Ioulaum's longevity''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] of [[epic magic]] that extended the caster's lifespan, but at a terrible cost of a life for every year gained.",
        "History": "This spell was developed and perfected by the powerful [[archwizard]] [[Ioulaum]] of [[Netheril]] ''circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|3185|NY}}, during Netheril's [[Shadowed Age]].<ref group=\"note\">Page 9 of [[Netheril: Empire of Magic|''The Winds of Netheril'']] states that Ioulaum developed his ''longevity'' spell just as [[Karsus]] was becoming the youngest archwizard ever at the age of 22. Calculating from his birth year gives this date. He would spend much of his time focusing on improving it, among other matters. However, ''Ioulaum's longevity'' often failed under the effects of the [[phaerimm]]'s ''[[life drain]]'' and ''[[magic drain]]''. Regardless, he used it to extend his lifespan over the centuries before and after the [[Fall of Netheril]] in the {{yearlinkName|-339}}.\n\nIoulaum eventually perfected his spell\n\nAt his hidden lair in the [[Northdark]], Ioulaum taught his namesake spell to [[Tabra]], his last human apprentice. However, he had also taken [[mind flayer]] apprentices from the neighboring [[illithid]] colony of [[Ellyn'taal]], who formed a dozen-strong cabal of [[illithilich]]es known as the [[Alhoon (organization)|Alhoon]].''Volo's Guide to the North'' p. 222 says that Tabra used the spell to escape being sacrificed by illithids, while ''Lost Empires of Faer√ªn'' pp. 99 and 100 have her attack them in revenge. This article attempts to merge both versions. Furthermore, the former implies a single casting slaying over 2,000, while the latter says Tabra slew only a few survivors and made many repeated castings later. Taken together, and given the limited area of the spell, it may be that Tabra used multiple castings across the city. more than 2000 in number. By the time she was done, Tabra had gained a lifespan of over two millennia.\n\nAfterward, Tabra destroyed every last record of ''Ioulaum's longevity'',Again, ''Volo's'' says \"destroyed all records\" and \"has no plans to recreate the spell\", implying she even destroyed her own, while ''Lost Empires'' specifically has her retain her own. so that it could not be used by villainous mages who would not baulk at its terrible cost. She then escaped to the surface world.\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1374}}, Tabra disappeared from [[Bargewright Inn]], her whereabouts unknown. The [[Shadovar]] of the returned Netherese enclave of [[Thultanthar]] had kidnapped Tabra and taken her to the City of Shade. The [[Princes of Shade]] and [[Telamont Tanthul]] himself sought information on Ioulaum's fate, particularly his ''longevity'' spell. Over the following century and more, Telamont kept her captive, enslaved her, tortured her until her body was broken and scarred, and ransacked her mind until she lost all her kind nature and knew no joy ever again. When Telamont had no use for her, he kept her in magical stasis, so she knew no peace either. Yet she never gave up her secrets and still guarded knowledge of ''Ioulaum's longevity'' after her escape in the {{YearlinkName|1487}}.<ref>",
        "Effects": "Ioulaum developed two versions: initially one of the tenth circle of magic, then, after [[Mystra's Ban]] on such spells, an epic spell.\n\nThe epic-spell version of ''Ioulaum's longevity'' used by Tabra is reported to have functioned as follows. When cast, ''Ioulaum's longevity'' instantly dealt massive damage to every creature within its area of effect. Any creature slain by this spell was reduced to fine dust. The spell also damaged [[construct]]s, objects, and [[undead]], but only living creatures could contribute to the longevity of the caster. Each living creature destroyed by this spell permanently extended the lifespan of the caster by one year within their current age range. For example, a middle-aged caster would remain in middle age that much longer. It covered an area of {{SI|240|ft|long=yes}} and functioned to a distance of up to {{SI|12000|ft|long=yes}}. One version was instead reported to require the death of a mage specifically for each year gained.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]] s to cast, but without live creatures within the radius of effect there would be no benefit.\n\nFor a true master of spellcraft, it took some 27 days and 1,368,000 [[gp]] worth of resources to develop, and the epic spell seeds ''destroy'' and ''fortify''."
