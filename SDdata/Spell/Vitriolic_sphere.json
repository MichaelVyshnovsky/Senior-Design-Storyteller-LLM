        "mainbody": "Vitriolic sphere was an evocation spell that created an explosion of acid.\nThe spell created a shimmering emerald-green sphere of acid about  in diameter that then flew directly to a point within a range of  of the caster. Upon arriving at its target, the sphere exploded and covered everyone within  in potent acid, which remained active for several seconds following the explosion.\nOlder versions of this spell, belonging to the conjuration school, had a longer range, reaching up to  and producing acid that lasted for up to 5 minutes.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was either a drop of bile from a giant slug or a small glass vile filled with aqua regia."
