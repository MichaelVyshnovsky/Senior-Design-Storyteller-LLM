        "mainbody": "'''''Wheel of bones''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to [[specialty priest]]s and other followers of [[Eldath]], the Green Goddess. It created a whirling weapon of bone fragments around one appendage of the caster that could be used as both a melee weapon and a ranged weapon.",
        "Effects": "When cast, a halo of bone fragments formed around the chosen limb of the caster, spinning rapidly like a circular saw blade for five minutes (longer for more experienced casters) or until the caster willed the spell to end, whichever came first. The ''wheel of bones'' made a slashing melee weapon that the caster could wield at his or her normal skill level. In addition, the caster could fire a random number of bone shards (maximum of three per use) at a chosen target with a very high level of skill for a small amount of damage. The target of flung fragments did not have to be the same as the melee target, and the caster could choose either attack form, or use both at the same time. The ranged attack was similar to that of a [[short bow]] with no penalty or bonus for targets at point blank range.\n\nThe caster of ''wheel of bones'' was not harmed in any way by the spinning bone shards, even if they ricocheted and struck the caster. If the caster attempted to hold or grasp anything with the appendage anchoring the ''wheel'', or if he or she cast another spell, then ''wheel of bones'' ended and the fragments faded away immediately.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required at least two bones or bone fragments of any kind.",
        "Users": "Peacemen and peacewomen of Eldath could only use this spell for non-aggressive purposes or self-defense."
