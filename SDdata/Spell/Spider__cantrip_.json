        "Effects": "This cantrip conjured a single common spider. It appeared at a spot within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}<ref group=\"note\">The original description of this spell in [[Dragon magazine 60|''Dragon'' #60]] used the 1{{st}}-edition nomenclature <code>1\"</code>, meaning {{SI|10|ft}} indoors and {{SI|10|yd}} outdoors. This was simplified to the shorter range in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. of the caster and arrived in an irritated state. If summoned upon a living creature, the spider immediately tried to bite, distracting the target for a few seconds. There was a slight chance that the conjured spider was venomous, in which case the target took minimal damage and had a chance to resist, or else fall ill for a few days. The effects of spider venom could be reduced with ''[[slow poison]]'' or removed with ''[[neutralize poison]]''.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster spoke the word \"arachnid\" while wiggling their fingers like the legs of a crawling spider."
