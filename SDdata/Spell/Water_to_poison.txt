Water to poison was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, the wu jen was able to transform any consumable liquid into a poison. The strength of the poison was determined by the wu jens skill level. A single swallow was enough to poison a creature. The poison could be detected by a creature with a keen sense of smell. 
Poison to water was the reverse of the spell. It allowed a wu jen to transform liquid containing poison into water safe for consumption. It was able to transform pure venom as well. The spell had no effect on a creature with venomous glands, or a creature who was already poisoned.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a fang of a venomous snake, and a bloodstone valued at least 50 gp.
