        "mainbody": "Life transference was a necromantic spell that allowed a caster to heal another. \nWhen cast, the caster took necrotic damage and healed another creature. The spell functioned by transferring some of the life force of the caster to the injured creature. For the spell to be effective, the target creature was required to be within  of the caster. The amount of life force taken from the caster and the amount of healing it offered was determined by the casters skill level.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
