        "mainbody": "Shadow mask was a shadow spell used by arcane spellcasters in the Realms. It was one of the spells commonly employed by Harper agents who could cast spells.\nThe spell produced a mask of shadows, drawn from the Plane of Shadow, to cover and obscure the casters face so that he or she could not be recognized. The mask did not impede the casters vision nor could it be physically removed. Even if it were dispelled or the spell ended, it took several seconds or more to fade out of existence, giving the caster time to find another means of protecting his or her face from recognition.\nIn addition to assisting in the hiding of ones identity, the mask also protected from various other spell effects that involved light or darkness. It also offered some protection from gaze attacks.\nThe mask lasted at least a half hour, but could last much longer if cast by a more powerful spellcaster.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components and a mask of black cloth, which was consumed in the casting.\nThis spell was included in the Rudiments of the Shadow Weave, a controversial book about Sharran doctrine and the Shadow Weave, written by the wizard Vontallion Rose."
