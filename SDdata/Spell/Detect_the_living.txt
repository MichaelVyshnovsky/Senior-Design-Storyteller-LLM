Detect the living was a common spell used by ninjas. It was very rarely found outside Kara-Tur.
While similar to detect undead, a ninja used this spell to identify the presence of living creatures. During casting, the ninja was required to remain motionless. The spell revealed the presence of living creatures with a faint glow that was only visible to the ninja, along a path 10 feet (3 meters) wide and 60 feet (18 meters) long. 
The spell only showed the direction of a living creature, and did not reveal the species or alignment. The spell was able to penetrate walls, but certain barriers would block the spell, such as a thin layer of metal, solid stone, walls of loose earth, or thick wood. The spell was unable to detect the presence of small animals or plants.
The spell required only kuji-kiri hand gestures as the somatic component.
