Skeletal guard was a spell used by necromancers.
When cast, the spell created eight skeletons from eight finger bones. The caster had total control over the skeletons, giving orders via silent mental commands. The skeletons remained within  of the caster. If a skeleton was forced beyond this distance, they remained immobile until the caster came within range once more. After creating the skeletons, the caster was able to continue casting other spells, as no further concentration was required to keep the spell active. When the spell expired, the skeletons crumbled into dust.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components eight bones from the finger of a human. They had to be intact. During casting, the the caster threw them onto the ground.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
