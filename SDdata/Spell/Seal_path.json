        "mainbody": "'''''Seal path''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that closed off further development of a [[Path magic|path of magic]] the victim followed.",
        "Effects": "This spell permanently prevented a [[wizard]] from learning any new spells within a specific [[path of power]] or [[school of magic]] designated by the caster. In some cases, ''seal path'' was so effective that it added the effect of the ''[[close path]]'' spell on the victim. It was, however, not without risks: if the target withstood the magic, it could be reflected on the caster.\n\nThe effect of ''seal path'' was permanent, and could only be removed with a ''[[limited wish]]'', ''[[wish]]'', or by casting the reversed form, '''''open path'''''.",
        "Components": "In addition to using [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, both ''seal path'' and its reversed form required a specially crafted seal of polished metal. It had to be made from alloyed [[mithral]] and [[lead]], engraved with the victim's name or sigil. It had a material worth of at least 1000 [[gp]].",
        "Relation": "''Seal path'', together with the spells ''close path'' and ''[[burn path]]'', formed the rarely found Path of Paths, dreaded by followers of [[path magic]] as it directly attacked their spellcasting ability."
