'''''Magnetism''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
If a wu jen cast this spell on themself, ferromagnetic materials such as [[iron]], steel and nickel were drawn to the wu jen's hand. The material had to be within 60 yards (54 meters) from the wu jen. Wu jen often used this spell to wrest weapons from an opponent's hands. If a wu jen tried to attract a material with greater mass than the wu jen, then the spell had the opposite effect, with the wu jen drawn to the heavy material.  

If a wu jen cast this spell on another creature, any ferromagnetic materials within 30 feet (9 meters) from the creature were drawn to them. If the material had a greater mass than the creature, the creature was then drawn to the material.  

The reverse of the spell was ''[[demagnetize]]''. This spell completely cancelled the effects of the ''magnetism'' spell.

More experienced casters could cast a ''superior'' version of this spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a piece of [[lodestone]], while ''demagnetize'' required a small rod made of wood.
