Thrice was a spell that increased the combat skills of a caster.
After casting, the casters abilities in physical combat were temporarily increased. Their skill in hand-to-hand combat and use of a melee weapon were both increased. The spell also increased the ability to cast spells with a touch effect.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, three samarskites of roughly equal size.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
