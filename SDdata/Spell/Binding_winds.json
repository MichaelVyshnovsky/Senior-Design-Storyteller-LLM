        "mainbody": "'''''Binding winds''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell used a swirling barrier of wind to bind a target. The targeted creature was unable to move. If used against a flying creature, they were held suspended in the air. The wind was so strong that the target was unable to communicate with anyone outside the barrier and no one could hear the immobilized creature. \n\nAs a result of this spell, the targeted creature was unable to cast spells that required somatic components nor any sonic or language-based spell. The caster was able to target a creature up to {{SI|100|ft}} away, this range increased as the caster's skill level grew.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components."
