        "mainbody": "'''''Conjure elemental''''' was a [[conjuration/summoning]] spell that allowed a [[wizard]] to call and control either an [[Air elemental|air]], [[Earth elemental|earth]], [[Fire elemental|fire]] or [[water elemental]].",
        "Effects": "The type of [[elemental]] needed to be fixed during memorization and each required a different material component and a certain amount of the respective element. The spell always carried a certain risk that the conjured elemental would break free. A ''[[protection from evil]]'' provided a defense in that case.",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, and the element in question, casting this spell required a small amount of burning [[incense]] to conjure an air elemental, of soft [[clay]] for an earth elemental, of [[sulfur]] and [[phosphorus]] for a fire elemental, and [[water]] and [[sand]] for a water elemental.",
        "History": "The ''conjure elemental'' spell was first introduced in the time of [[Netheril]], in [[-1728 DR|2131 NY (âˆ’1728 DR)]], under the name '''''Tipald's conjuration''''', after the [[arcanist]] [[Tipald]].\n\nIn the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''conjure elemental'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}\n\n''Conjure elemental'' was commonly known and used by the magical community by [[1358 DR]]."
