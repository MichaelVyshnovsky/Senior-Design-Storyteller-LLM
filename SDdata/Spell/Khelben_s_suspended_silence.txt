Khelbens suspended silence was an alteration spell that created a field of silence around any inanimate object that was smaller than the caster.
This spell could be cast on any item smaller than the caster, such as a stone, piece of furniture, weapon or even the corpse of a smaller-sized creature. Once cast, and a command word was chosen, the item was imbued with the magical effects of suspended silence bur remained inactive. This magic left a faint, but detectable aura that could be readily dispelled.
When the item was touched and the command word spoken, a magical sphere of silence, 20 (6.1 m) in radius, emanated from the center-point of the affected object. The sphere moved with the object and remained for approximately 36 seconds.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a feather and a handful of dust.
This spell was developed by the first Blackstaff, Khelben Arunsun, sometime prior to the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.While no date is given for The Ruins of Undermountain, it was a 2 edition sourcebook that pre-dated the 3 edition material that began in the year 1372 DR.
