        "mainbody": "Continual faerie fire was an alteration spell that created permanent light.\nContinual faerie fire colored an object permanently with a pale glowing light. This light could be of any desired color. The light could be made into glowing continuous forms within the area the spell affected.\nThe light of this spell was sensitive to life-energy and magic. When the former was painted with the light from continual faerie fire, they radiated a black aura. When the latter was limned with the light from continual faerie fire, small white motes appeared, which were concentrated around the source of magic. For example, an undead under a polymorph and a continual faerie fire spell would radiate a black aura, surrounded by a halo of flickering white, while being painted in a light of the casters choice.\nCreatures and objects that were painted by the light but left the area under the effect of the spell were limned with the light for about a minute.\nThe light of this spell was never strong enough to cause harm to objects or light-sensitive creatures.\nA dispel magic spell ended the light permanently.\nThe spell required verbal components and material components in the form of a some foxfire, a single drop of water, and a small bit of bone dust.\nContinual faerie fire was a spell that was associated with the drow. Amber, green, red, and ale-brown were their preferred colors in order of popularity. Using more exotic colors was seen as an adventurous trait in a cleric.\nThe spell was used to paint entire murals and to highlight temples or other important buildings inside drow cities. Outside of their cities, drow used the spell to mark working areas for their slaves and to mark trails, landmarks, or borders. They also used color codes.\nGhaunadan clerics used it to paint their holy symbols in mauve colors.\nThe House of the Moon temple to Sel√ªne in Waterdeep used continual faerie fire to have streaks of silvery light moving along the floors."
