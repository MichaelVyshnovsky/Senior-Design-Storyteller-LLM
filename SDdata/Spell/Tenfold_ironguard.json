        "Effects": "When cast, this spell made ten individuals immune to the touch of non-[[Item enchantment|enchanted]] metal. Metal objects would pass through the recipients as if they were non-corporeal.\n\n''Tenfold ironguard'' was unique to others like it, in that it allowed each recipient to choose a single metal item that would not be affected by the spell's effects.",
        "History": "The title of this spell was inscribed within the ''[[Helm of Helm]]'' and could be cast by utterance of its wearer.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, along with a small amount of [[iron]] fillings and a single drop of ''[[aqua regia]]''."
