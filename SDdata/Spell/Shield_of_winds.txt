Shield of winds was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell created an invisible windy barrier by creating strands of chaotic gusts of wind, resulting in a nearly impenetrable wall. Only purely magical weapons such as magic missles could pass through the wall. Enchanted objects like arrows were stopped in their tracks. Either dispel magic or anti-magic shell could destroy the wall.
This spell only required the presence of air to cast.
