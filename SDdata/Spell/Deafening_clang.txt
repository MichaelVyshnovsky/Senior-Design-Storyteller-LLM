'''''Deafening clang''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s of [[Gaerdal Ironhand]].

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to enchant a metal weapon with a sonic power. When the weapon hit a solid surface, it emitted an incredibly loud clang. Any creature who heard this clang was rendered temporarily [[deaf]]. The caster was immune to the effects of the spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[divine focus]]. The clerical spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Gaerdal Ironhand and a small, round gong made from metal.
