'''''Shroud of undeath''''' was an [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s.

==Effects==
This spell cloaked the caster in [[negative energy]], making them appear [[undead]] to other undead. The caster's appearance remained the same which would probably prompt questioning from intelligent undead such as [[vampire]]s or [[lich]]es. The spell would end immediately if the caster attacked an undead creature.

While under the effects of ''shroud of undeath'', the caster experienced the opposite effects of healing or curse spells. For example, healing spells would harm them and curse spells would heal them.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required dust or bone fragments from a destroyed undead creature to cast. The caster was also susceptible to other things typically meant to harm or effect undead such as [[holy water]] and turning.
