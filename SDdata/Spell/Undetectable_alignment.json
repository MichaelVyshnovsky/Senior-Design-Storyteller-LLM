        "mainbody": "'''''Undetectable alignment''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that shielded the subject's alignment from detection. It was also the name of the reverse of the [[divination]] spell '''''know alignment'''''.",
        "Effects": "This spell could be cast on a creature or an object within close range. This spell rendered the subject's alignment hidden and unknowable from all methods of [[divination]] for one day.\n\nWhen cast in reverse, the ''know alignment'' spell was a [[divination]] that allowed the caster to examine the aura of a person or object and get a reading on the alignment of the target. Creatures and objects with intelligence or a will had a chance to resist this spell, but if that failed, the caster could learn the non-neutral alignments ([[Alignment|lawful]] ''vs.'' [[Alignment|chaotic]], [[Alignment|good]] ''vs.'' [[Alignment|evil]]) in one minute of quiet concentration. If the caster was able to remain still and concentrate for a full two minutes, then even the subtler alignments could be completely determined.",
        "Components": "Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were required to cast this spell.",
        "History": "''Know alignment''/''undetectable alignment'' was created by prolific [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Trebbe]] in {{Yearlink|-2237}} under the name '''''Trebbe's scry alignment''''', his last spell invention before his accidental death within the same year.<ref>"
