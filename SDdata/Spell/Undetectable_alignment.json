        "mainbody": "Undetectable alignment was an abjuration spell that shielded the subjects alignment from detection. It was also the name of the reverse of the divination spell know alignment.\nThis spell could be cast on a creature or an object within close range. This spell rendered the subjects alignment hidden and unknowable from all methods of divination for one day.\nWhen cast in reverse, the know alignment spell was a divination that allowed the caster to examine the aura of a person or object and get a reading on the alignment of the target. Creatures and objects with intelligence or a will had a chance to resist this spell, but if that failed, the caster could learn the non-neutral alignments (lawful vs. chaotic, good vs. evil) in one minute of quiet concentration. If the caster was able to remain still and concentrate for a full two minutes, then even the subtler alignments could be completely determined.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.\nKnow alignment/undetectable alignment was created by prolific Netherese arcanist Trebbe in  under the name Trebbes scry alignment, his last spell invention before his accidental death within the same year."
