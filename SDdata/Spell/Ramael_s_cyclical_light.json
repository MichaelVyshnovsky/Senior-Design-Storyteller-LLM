        "mainbody": "Ramaels cyclical light was a spell unique to Halruaa.\nThis spell was similar to the continual light spell, but it faded and glowed with exterior light. This spell could only be cast upon an object.\nAn the object used during casting glowed brightly when placed in a darkened area. If placed in a medium lit area, the item would dim the light over several minutes so that it was not overbearing.\nThis spell could be cast without physical components, at which point it mimicked the continual light spell. If cast with a gemstones worth at least 10 gp, the light produced would appear as the same color as the gemstone."
