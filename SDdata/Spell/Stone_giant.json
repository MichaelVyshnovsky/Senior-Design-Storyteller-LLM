Within this mighty kingdom they created some of the greatest works of giant art.

They eschewed weapons, preferring to attack with their claws and the razor sharp teeth embedded in their protruding jaws.\nCraaghoran giants Stone giants who had been exposed long ago to elemental energy from the Elemental Plane of Earth by druidic devotees of Gond. They were taller than stone giants, could live up to 8,000 years, and could weigh up to ten times more than them due to the massive chunks of rock that formed much of their bodies.
