Absorb elements was an abjuration spell that protected the caster against certain types of energy, while at the same time storing and returning part of that energy by infusing it into a subsequent attack from the caster.
A caster just hit by an attack or effect that dealt damage from acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder could react quickly to cast absorb elements in order to become resistant against that type of element for a few seconds, considerably reducing the damage taken. Part of the energy absorbed was then stored during that time. If the caster successfully hit an opponent with a melee attack, the stored energy was released on that opponent.
The spell required only somatic components.
