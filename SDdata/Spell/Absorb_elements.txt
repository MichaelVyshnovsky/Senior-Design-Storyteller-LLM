'''''Absorb elements''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that protected the caster against certain types of energy, while at the same time storing and returning part of that energy by infusing it into a subsequent attack from the caster.

==Effects==
A caster just hit by an attack or effect that dealt damage from [[acid]], cold, [[fire]], lightning, or thunder could react quickly to cast ''absorb elements'' in order to become resistant against that type of element for a few seconds, considerably reducing the damage taken. Part of the energy absorbed was then stored during that time. If the caster successfully hit an opponent with a melee attack, the stored energy was released on that opponent.

==Components==
The spell required only [[somatic component]]s.
