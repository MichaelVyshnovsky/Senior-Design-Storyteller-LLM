Chaos shield was a spell used by wild mages.
A wild mage used this spell to protect themself during a surge of magical energy. The spell did not protect the caster from a wild surge caused by another casters spell. The spell did not differentiate between negative or positive effects of a wild surge, the caster was protected from both. The spell only protected the caster, anyone in their vicinity was still at risk. It was often cast after the Nahals reckless dweomer spell.
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
