This spell was only used by [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], and they never shared it with outsiders.",
        "Components": "The spell required a bound, restrained, and helpless human to be subjected to an hour-long series of ritualistic torture sessions. Apart from the prolonged agony of the target, the spell had somatic and vocal components.\n\nThis ritual spell was available to [[evil]]-aligned [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "Once the ritual of torture was complete and the last syllables of the spell were spoken, the victim was engulfed in the ''[[death magic]]'' energies that twisted, disfigured, and mutated the target into a gangly vicious creature known as [[chosen one]] under full control of its master creator. Nothing short of a ''[[wish]]'' spell could reverse this transformation."
