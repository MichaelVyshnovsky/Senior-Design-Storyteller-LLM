Seeming was a spell used by bards, sorcerers and wizards.
A caster used this spell to alter the appearance of one or multiple creatures. The targeted creatures had to be within 30 feet (9 meters) and within sight of the caster. The spell altered the physical appearance of the creatures, as well as their equipment such as clothing, armor and weapons.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
Seeming was unkown to the arcanists of ancient Netheril. By the 1360s DR it was considered an uncommon spell in the magical community of Faer√ªn, while it was commonly used in Zakhara.
