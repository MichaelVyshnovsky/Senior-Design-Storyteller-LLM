Silverbeard was a transmutation spell used by dwarven paladins who worshiped Clangeddin Silverbeard.
This spell turned a dwarfs beard into magically hardened pure silver. The silver was actually hard enough to offer protection during combat. This spell would transform a beard, or make the caster grown one for the duration of the spell.
Silverbeard was often used to impress other dwarves, though overuse of the spell caused a natural beard to turn a silver color.
This spell required verbal components to cast.
