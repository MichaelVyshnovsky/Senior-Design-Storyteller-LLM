'''''Silverbeard''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] used by [[dwarven]] [[paladin]]s who worshiped [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]].

==Effects==
This spell turned a dwarf's beard into magically hardened pure [[silver]]. The silver was actually hard enough to offer protection during combat. This spell would transform a beard, or make the caster grown one for the duration of the spell.

''Silverbeard'' was often used to impress other dwarves, though overuse of the spell caused a natural beard to turn a silver color.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] components to cast.
