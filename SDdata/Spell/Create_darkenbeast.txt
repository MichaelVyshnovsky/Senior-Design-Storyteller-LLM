'''''Create darkenbeast''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to transform a few creatures into [[darkenbeast]]s.

==Effects==
The spell would affect any non-[[humanoid]], semi-intelligent mammals in a designated {{SIAdj|20|ft|adj=wide}} circle. It had to be cast in darkness, such as underground or at night as whenever daylight struck a [[magic]]ally created darkenbeast it would revert back to its natural form. Spells like ''[[sun ray]]'' and ''[[sun blade]]'' could also have this effect. 

==Component==
The material component for this spell was the dried blood of a [[wyvern]] as well as a [[moonstone]] that was used as a magical focus.

==History==
Circa the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, a Red Wizard [[Maligor]] used '''''create darkenbeast''''' to shapeshift hundreds if not thousands of animals into darkenbeasts to be used as bloodhounds and his personal army.
