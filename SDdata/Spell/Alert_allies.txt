'''''Alert allies''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Gorm Gulthyn]].

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to send a short mental message instantaneously to an ally. This spell did not allow for two-way communication, and the only message the caster could transmit was "alert". The recipient had to be both alive and awake, and a sentient being. They also had to be within {{SI|30|yd|long=yes}} of the caster.

The spell could be cast on several individuals, and lasted eight hours or until the alert was transmitted, whichever came first.

==Components==
This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components. The somatic component of the spell was the caster physical contact with the recipient during casting.
