        "mainbody": "'''''Corpse host''''' was an [[arcane]] spell of the [[necromancy]] school that allowed a [[necromancer]] to temporarily transfer the consciousness or \"life force\" of a living creature into the corpse of a [[demihuman]], [[human]], or [[humanoid]], thereby animating said corpse.{{Cite dragon/216/Paths of Power|49}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"canon\">Path magic is an alternative system of rules for the spell progression and learning of spells by [[wizard]]s for 2{{nd}} edition ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''. They could therefore be considered potentially non-canon.",
        "Effects": "This spell could only be cast upon a living target. A necromancer could not target an undead creature to be the host of a cadaver.\n\nWhilst ''corpse host'' was active, the targeted living creature had a full range of capability for animating the corpse they inhabited. This included movement, performing actions, carrying things, and even casting [[spell]]s. They could not, however, perform exacting tasks and handicrafts, such as [[lockpick]]ing or sewing for example.\n\nA cadaver affected by ''corpse host'' ceased to decay. Unless [[illusion]] magic was cast upon the corpse, it would appear to all eyes as being an [[undead]] creature. Any magical items it adorned would not pass their effects on to the recipient's living body. The cadaver could move a minimum distance of {{SI|5|mile|long=yes}} from the living body, with this range extending further based upon the spellcaster's skills in magic. The active of the spell was a minimum of 1 day, likewise extending further based upon the individual necromancer's skills in magic.\n\nIf the cadaver moved outside of this effective range or into another [[plane]], the mind of the recipient of ''corpse host'' would return to their living body and the cadaver would immediately collapse, resuming its original decay. Additionally, the recipient could at will leave the cadaver their were piloting and return to their original body. In both cases, there existed no chance of the recipient suffering any sort of shock to their system.\n\nThe targeted individual's mind was active simultaneously in both their original body and the corpse's, allowing them to hear, see, sense from both. They could also talk through the corpse, though their voice would come out in a hoarse variation of the corpse's original voice. The mind inhabiting the cadaver was subject to magical and [[psionic]] powers that affected the mind. For this same reason, the cadaver's senses could be fooled by illusions. Because the piloted corpse was not truly undead, it was unaffected by the [[cleric]]al power ''[[turn undead]]'', nor any spells or magics whose effects targeted the undead.\n\nFor the duration of ''corpse host'', the targeted individual could not move their body &ndash; for this reason, people were often left to stand guard over the host body. The target could only make their original body blink, breath, and move its eyes. During this period the living creature's body was also not subject to the basic bodily needs of eating, drinking, and sleeping. Any physical attacks inflicted upon the cadaver would not transfer harm to the recipient's real body, though upon destruction of the cadaver or severance of the link between it and the target's real body, the recipient of ''corpse host'' experienced a shock to their system that carried a small chance of fatality.\n\nArcane spells that could sever the spiritual link between the cadaver and the living body included ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', and ''[[wish]]''. [[Divine magic]] spells that could do the same included ''[[dispel evil]]'' and ''[[spirit release]]''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, casting this spell required several [[material component]]s. These included a fresh corpse and a freshly excised patch of skin from the spellcaster's target. The removal of this flesh could cause minor permanent damage to the recipient's overall constitution, harm that could only be reversed with a ''wish'' spell or healed with ''[[restoration]]''.",
