        "mainbody": "Corpse host was an arcane spell of the necromancy school that allowed a necromancer to temporarily transfer the consciousness or \"life force\" of a living creature into the corpse of a demihuman, human, or humanoid, thereby animating said corpse.Path magic is an alternative system of rules for the spell progression and learning of spells by wizards for 2 edition Dungeons & Dragons. They could therefore be considered potentially non-canon.\nThis spell could only be cast upon a living target. A necromancer could not target an undead creature to be the host of a cadaver.\nWhilst corpse host was active, the targeted living creature had a full range of capability for animating the corpse they inhabited. This included movement, performing actions, carrying things, and even casting spells. They could not, however, perform exacting tasks and handicrafts, such as lockpicking or sewing for example.\nA cadaver affected by corpse host ceased to decay. Unless illusion magic was cast upon the corpse, it would appear to all eyes as being an undead creature. Any magical items it adorned would not pass their effects on to the recipients living body. The cadaver could move a minimum distance of  from the living body, with this range extending further based upon the spellcasters skills in magic. The active of the spell was a minimum of 1 day, likewise extending further based upon the individual necromancers skills in magic.\nIf the cadaver moved outside of this effective range or into another plane, the mind of the recipient of corpse host would return to their living body and the cadaver would immediately collapse, resuming its original decay. Additionally, the recipient could at will leave the cadaver their were piloting and return to their original body. In both cases, there existed no chance of the recipient suffering any sort of shock to their system.\nThe targeted individuals mind was active simultaneously in both their original body and the corpses, allowing them to hear, see, sense from both. They could also talk through the corpse, though their voice would come out in a hoarse variation of the corpses original voice. The mind inhabiting the cadaver was subject to magical and psionic powers that affected the mind. For this same reason, the cadavers senses could be fooled by illusions. Because the piloted corpse was not truly undead, it was unaffected by the clerical power turn undead, nor any spells or magics whose effects targeted the undead.\nFor the duration of corpse host, the targeted individual could not move their body &ndash for this reason, people were often left to stand guard over the host body. The target could only make their original body blink, breath, and move its eyes. During this period the living creatures body was also not subject to the basic bodily needs of eating, drinking, and sleeping. Any physical attacks inflicted upon the cadaver would not transfer harm to the recipients real body, though upon destruction of the cadaver or severance of the link between it and the targets real body, the recipient of corpse host experienced a shock to their system that carried a small chance of fatality.\nArcane spells that could sever the spiritual link between the cadaver and the living body included dispel magic, limited wish, and wish. Divine magic spells that could do the same included dispel evil and spirit release.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, casting this spell required several material components. These included a fresh corpse and a freshly excised patch of skin from the spellcasters target. The removal of this flesh could cause minor permanent damage to the recipients overall constitution, harm that could only be reversed with a wish spell or healed with restoration.\n* Mezzalcat, a drow necromancer.\n* Sammaster, the necromantic founder of the Cult of the Dragon, who inscribed the spell within the Tome of the Dragon.\n* Talib al-Ysawis, a Zakharan deathslayer-type necromancer."
