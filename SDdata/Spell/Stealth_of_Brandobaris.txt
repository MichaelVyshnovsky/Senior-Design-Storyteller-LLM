'''''Stealth of Brandobaris''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to [[priest]]s of [[Brandobaris]], the Trickster. It greatly improved the caster's ability to move in silence and hide in the shadows, like a trained [[thief]].

==Effects==
This spell only affected the caster's abilitiesâ€”it could not be cast on others. The spell lasted for at least fifteen minutes (longer for more experienced casters) but could be negated by a successful ''[[dispel magic]]'' or similar effect. In general, the more experienced the caster was, the greater the chances of successful sneaking and hiding while under the influence of this spell. [[Misadventurer]]s ([[specialty priest]]s of Brandobaris) and those that already had some thieving experience were blessed with an even greater improvement to the odds.

==Components==
This spell could be cast silently, requiring only a [[somatic component]] and the priest's [[holy symbol]].
