        "mainbody": "Horrendous dessication was a necromancy spell of epic magic.\nHorrendous dessication caused everything to dry up within a large area that grew with the casters skill. The effect caused organic matter to dry up, the degree of which increased with the casters skill, and could easily lead to death. The same happened to bodies of water like lakes or rivers. Such places lost a large amount of their water.\nThe caster was safe from the drying effect. However, casting this spell caused one of the casters limbs to wither.\nHorrendous dessication required somatic, verbal, and material components. The material component was one dose of dust of dryness.\nBy the 14 century DR, horrendous dessication was considered to be one of the most fearsome spells ever developed on Faer√ªn."
