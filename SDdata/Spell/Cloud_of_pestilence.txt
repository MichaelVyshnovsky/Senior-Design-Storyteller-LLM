'''''Cloud of pestilence''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[Talona|Talonite]] [[cleric]]s that created a motionless, acrid cloud.

==Effects==
The cloud summoned by this spell was {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} tall, {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} deep, and {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} wide. Similar to ''[[cloudkill]]'', it consisted of green-yellow vapor. The caster was immune to all effects of the cloud. Foes entering the volume of the cloud were subject to violent coughing and took damage. Because of this, those inside the cloud could not cast spells, speak normally, or complete dexterous tasks. If the affected creatures did not leave the cloud, they would be subject to further damage, be ''[[slow]]ed'', and gain blurry vision. This made it harder to hit their target or recognize a target, and made them more easily fall over. Staying in the cloud even longer caused the creature to fall unconscious, and take heavy damage.

Remaining within the cloud for prolonged activity caused a lung [[disease]] known as [[Talona's grimace]]. Once diseased, the creature's movement was permanently reduced, and they had their health significantly reduced as time went on. Their face would also twitch, often making the grimace of the name.

==Components==
The spell required both [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
