'''''Mist of the goddess''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to priests of [[Eldath]], the Quiet One. It created a holy mist that could return one unfortunate soul to full health, blessed vitality, and mental acuity, or it could be used to reincarnate one or more beings.

==Effects==
This spell created a green, glowing mist in the shape of a conical tent with its apex {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} above a circular base. The base could be specified as small as {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} to as large as {{SI|280|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. The center of the base could be placed up to {{SI|210|ft|long=yes}} away. The range of casting and the size of the base could be even larger for more experienced casters. Solid objects (walls, ceiling) could block the mist, but otherwise it expanded to the size chosen by the caster.

The recipient of this spell, chosen by the caster, had to be touched by the mist for the spell to take effect. If the recipient was a corpse, then it was first ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]'', followed by ''[[restoration]]'', ''[[regenerate|regeneration]]'', ''[[heal]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'', and ''[[cure disease]]''. If the caster did not choose a recipient, then the spell was applied to a random intelligent creature being touched by the mist, with priority given to the living over the dead.

If only corpses were touched by the mist, and the caster did not choose a recipient, then each of the dead got one chance to resist permanent death<ref group="note">This saving throw was unorthodox because ''reincarnation'' did not normally have a saving throw, and if the dead being successfully resisted ''mist of the goddess'' then it was reincarnated. and, if successful, were ''[[reincarnate]]d'' regardless of how long they had been dead. Their new form was compatible with the environment of their surroundings, but was otherwise random.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a drop of water blessed by Eldath herself, blessed by one of her personal servitors invoking her name, or consecrated by a priest that had achieved the rank and title of Exalted of Eldath.
