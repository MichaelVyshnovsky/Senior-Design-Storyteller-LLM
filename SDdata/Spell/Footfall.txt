Footfall was a haunting cantrip that acolyte wizards could learn. It could create the illusory sound of humanoid footsteps nearby.
This cantrip produced the auditory illusion of footsteps within a radius of  from the caster.The description of this cantrip in Dragon #60 used the notation 2" which can be interpreted as , but the Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four chose this to be  instead. The sound appeared to originate within  of the caster and then moved wherever the caster desired as determined by the somatic gesture. The footsteps could be made to approach, recede, follow, stop, start, and so on. The volume of the illusory tread could vary from soft to somewhat noisy.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster subvocalized the sound of footsteps while pointing at the location from which the sound appeared to emanate.
