        "mainbody": "'''''Gift of speech''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s. It was rarely used by [[cleric]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to temporarily bestow on an animal the ability to speak. The caster choose the language during casting, and had to be one they could speak themselves. The targeted animal was capable of understanding spoken words and simple concepts. However, the spell did not actually increase the intelligence of the targeted animal.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the [[holy symbol]] of the caster."
