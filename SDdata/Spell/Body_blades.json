Each one vaguely resembled the blade of a dagger. They were non-metallic in composition and did not obstruct the casters movement or vision.\nBody blades was one of the spells whose specifications could be found within the Lash of Loviatar.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required two sharpened pieces of metal and a single shard of bone."
