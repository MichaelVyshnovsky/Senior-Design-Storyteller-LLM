        "mainbody": "Nymphs beauty was a spell used by clerics of Hanali Celanil.\nWhen cast, this spell temporarily granted the caster, regardless of gender, the natural beauty of a nymph. When viewed by another creature, the unfortunate creature was rendered permanently blind. Once blinded, only heal, limited wish or wish spells could restore their sight. In addition, if the caster was nude, the caster could choose one of two additional effects that the observer would experience death or unconsciousness. The spell was rendered useless by near or total darkness.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the holy symbol of Hanali Celanil and a single tear from a nymph that was placed on the casters tongue during casting. The tear was consumed by the casting process."
