        "mainbody": "'''''Nymph's beauty''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Hanali Celanil]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell temporarily granted the caster, regardless of gender, the natural beauty of a [[nymph]]. When viewed by another creature, the unfortunate creature was rendered permanently blind. Once blinded, only ''[[heal]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'' or ''[[wish]]'' spells could restore their sight. In addition, if the caster was nude, the caster could choose one of two additional effects that the observer would experience: death or unconsciousness. The spell was rendered useless by near or total darkness.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s the [[holy symbol]] of Hanali Celanil and a single tear from a nymph that was placed on the caster's tongue during casting. The tear was consumed by the casting process."
