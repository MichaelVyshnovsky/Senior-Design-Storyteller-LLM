'''''Negative energy flood''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that bombarded a creature with waves of [[negative energy]].

==Effects==
The caster targeted a visible creature within a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}, sending bands of negative energy. If living and unable to resist the effect, the target creature's flesh shriveled away as the life force was drained from it. A creature killed by this spell rose as a [[zombie]] under the caster's control within seconds.

If the target creature was already [[undead]], the spell bolstered the target's vitality temporarily.

==Components==
The spell only required [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[material component]]s. The materials required were a broken bone and a square of black [[silk]].
