Call upon Gargauth was a powerful divine conjuration spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Gargauth called Malefactors.
This spell allowed the malefactor to contact Gargauth regardless of where the demigod was located to request his divine aid. If the casters offering or plight piqued Gargauths interest he might choose to answer the spells call. While Gargauth would followed the agreement with the caster, he would twist it to his own advantage wherever possible.
Gargauth spread rumors that collecting certain valuable magic items and casting the spell would allow the caster to control Gargauth when he appeared, but the Outcast simply appeared and took the desired item for himself.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components an unblessed broken horn manifested by Gargauth and the priests holy symbol to cast.
