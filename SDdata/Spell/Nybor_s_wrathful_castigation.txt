Nybors wrathful castigation was an enchantment spell that inflicted truly agonizing, lethal pain upon a target person or creature. 
For the spells duration, which lasted anywhere from two seconds to over two minutes, the affected victim was incapacitated by excruciating pain and uncontrollable convulsions. At any moment while they were affected by wrathful castigation the subjected creature could immediately drop dead.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a whip as a focus.
The spell was developed by the sadistic Red Wizard Nybor,
