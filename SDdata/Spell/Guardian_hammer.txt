'''''Guardian hammer''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Berronar Truesilver]].

==Effects==
This spell was used to guard an area such as a door. When triggered by a living creature, the spell activated. An invisible field of force in the shape of a large hammer flew towards the closest living creature. While the spell was only capable of triggering once, it did not miss a target. Physical and magical barriers would not stop the hammer from striking a target The creature unlucky enough to be struck by the hammer suffered injury as well as being temporarily stunned.

A ''guardian hammer'' spell could be deactivated with ''[[dispel magic]]''. Completely destroying the area guarded by the spell also rendered it useless.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, sweat or a tear from the caster, a lock of hair from a dwarven stonemason and either a pebble or piece of ice.
