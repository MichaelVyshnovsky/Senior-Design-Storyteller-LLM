'''''Water serpent''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] from the [[elemental water sphere]] that animated water into the form of a large serpent.

==Effects==
The mass of water needed to be at least three times the caster's body volume. The ''water serpent'' followed the caster's commands to the best of its ability. In combat it could "bite" at enemies with crushing water but could not constrict them. A ''water serpent'' could not be ridden as a mount.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] two fangs from an aquatic creature to cast.

==History==
''Water serpent'' was granted to [[priest]]s of [[Umberlee]], the Bitch Queen.
