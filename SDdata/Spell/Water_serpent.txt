Water serpent was a divine conjuration spell from the elemental water sphere that animated water into the form of a large serpent.
The mass of water needed to be at least three times the casters body volume. The water serpent followed the casters commands to the best of its ability. In combat it could "bite" at enemies with crushing water but could not constrict them. A water serpent could not be ridden as a mount.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component two fangs from an aquatic creature to cast.
Water serpent was granted to priests of Umberlee, the Bitch Queen.
