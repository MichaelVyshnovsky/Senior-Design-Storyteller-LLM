Loyal vassal was a spell used by paladins of Siamorphe.
When cast, this spell allowed the caster to protect a targeted creature from mind-affecting effects and spells. Additionally, the spell countered any magical compulsions that caused the targeted creature to harm the caster or another under the effects of the spell. As long as they were in view of the caster, a creature under this sell also had the same benefits of a bless spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a divine focus.
