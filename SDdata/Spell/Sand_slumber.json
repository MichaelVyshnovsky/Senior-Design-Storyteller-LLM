This spell was only usable by wizards.\nThis spell was used to cause sleep to fall upon any creature that normally required sleep, including genies. This spell lasted from a few minutes to an hour or two depending on the casters power. Targets instantly fell asleep, collapsing and dropping anything they were holding. They would remain asleep for the duration of the spell unless physically disturbed. Loud noises would not wake them.\nThis spell required a pinch of fine sand to cast."
