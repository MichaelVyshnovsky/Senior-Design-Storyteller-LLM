        "Effects": "This spell was used to cause sleep to fall upon any creature that normally required sleep, including [[genie]]s. This spell lasted from a few minutes to an hour or two depending on the caster's power. Targets instantly fell asleep, collapsing and dropping anything they were holding. They would remain asleep for the duration of the spell unless physically disturbed. Loud noises would not wake them.",
