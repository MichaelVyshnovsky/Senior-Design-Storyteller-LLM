Shadow shield was an illusion spell, specifically a phantasm, that formed an insubstantial shield.
Upon being cast, shadow shield drew material from the Demiplane of Shadow, which was then shaped by the will of the caster into a shield of any desired appearance. This shield was insubstantial, and while this meant it did not impede the casters movement as a normal shield would, it also did not physically defend its wielder to any degree.
Indeed, the shield proved ineffective against harm from sources lacking any direct agency, such as traps, geological hazards, or other spells. Thinking creatures, however, were often fooled and would instinctively pull back slightly from attacks against the shield. However, sufficiently intelligent opponents, perhaps clued in by recognizing their foe as a spellcaster or the odd interaction between their melee weapon and the shield, could overcome the illusions effects.
Aaldric Talzon of the Waterdhavian Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors detailed shadow shield in the Aegis Manual I, first in a prospective series of spellbooks containing protective spells.
