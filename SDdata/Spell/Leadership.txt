'''''Leadership''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[enchantment]] [[spell]] from the [[war sphere]] that boosted the target's command radius on the field of battle.

==Effects==
Any target within the caster's line of sight could be used for this spell. The spell could also be used within a temple dedicated to the caster's [[deity]] if an elaborate ritual was performed. This version of the spell lasted much longer.

The reverse of this spell, ''doubt'', had the opposite effect and reduced the command radius of the target.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a pinch of [[steel]] dust to cast.

==History==
[[Divine minion]]s, magical servitors of the [[god]]s of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]], were immune to the effects of the ''doubt'' spell.
