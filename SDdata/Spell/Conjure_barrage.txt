'''Conjure barrage''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[ranger]]s that could turn a single mundane missile into a swarm of them.

==Effect==
When the caster shot or threw a single non-magical missile into the air, the spell created a {{SIAdj|60|ft|long=yes}} wide cone of identical missiles in front of the caster, potentially striking many targets caught in the area.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]] in the form of a missile weapon, whether it be thrown like a [[throwing axe]] or shot like a [[crossbow]].
