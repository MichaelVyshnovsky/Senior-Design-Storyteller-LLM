        "mainbody": "Shapechange (also shape change) was a transmutation spell. \nA powerful variant of the polymorph family, it changed the users shape into any creature, and allowed him/her to change frequently.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Stoca in  and was originally called Stocas change shape.\nDuring the Time of Troubles of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, a brainwashed Luna used shapechange to turn into a silver dragon and attacked her friends Vajra Valmeyjar, Kyriani Agrivar, Onyx the Invincible, and Timoth Eyesbright. However, the spell did not last long, and she quickly reverted to human form."
