'''''Remove fatigue''''' was a restorative [[divine]] [[transmutation]] [[spell]] granted to [[cleric]]s and the [[Painbearer]]s of [[Ilmater]].

==Effects==
With a single touch, the caster restored stamina to a single creature, making it feel as if just awoken from a night of perfect restful sleep. However, it did not restore the exhausted spells of the tired spellcasters.
