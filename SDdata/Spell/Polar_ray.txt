Polar ray was a spell used by sorcerers and wizards.
When cast, a ray of freezing cold air and ice was released from the casters hands towards a target. The caster could attack an opponent up to  distant. The range and damage caused by the spell was determined by the casters skill level.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a divine focus, either a small cone made from ceramic that was painted white or a prism.
