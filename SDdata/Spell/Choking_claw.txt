Choking claw was an evocation spell used by dragons.
This spell created a black taloned claw of shimmering magical energy. The claw appeared in the air near a chosen target, attempting to rake them. The claw was unable to grab, strangle, or grapple. If the caster wished for the claw to attack a new target it would wink out of existence and reappear next to the new target. A choking claw would vanish if the caster began casting another spell.
This spell required only verbal components to cast.
