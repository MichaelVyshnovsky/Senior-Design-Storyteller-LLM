A '''pseudodragon''' was a small [[dragon]]-kin known to be playful.
{{TOC limit|3}}
==Description==
Pseudodragons typically had bodies about {{SI|1|foot|c|long=yes}} long, with a {{SIAdj|2|foot|c|long=yes|adj=long}} tail and weighed about {{SI|7|pound|k|long=yes}}. They had [[chameleon]]-like abilities, though their color was usually a brownish red.

==Abilities==
They could communicate telepathically in [[Common]] or [[Draconic]] and also through the vocalization of animal noises. While pseudodragons could bite, their main weapon was a stinging, poisonous tail. 

==Ecology==
===Behavior===
Their general attitude was similar to that of a small cat but with a cunning intelligence. They were wary of evil beings, but were willing to serve as a companion to another being if treated well and respected.

A pseudodragon often vocalizes animal noises. A rasping purr indicates pleasure, while a hiss means unpleasant surprise. A bird-like chirping represents desire, and a growl always means anger or discontent.

===Environment===
In the wild, pseudodragons often seek out quiet places to inhabit such as the hollows of trees and small caves. They are likely to be found in temperate forests.

==Significance==
They were sometimes dispatched in times of need by an array of deities including [[Brandobaris]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], [[Gond]], [[Gwaeron Windstrom]], [[Marthammor Duin]], [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]], and [[Rillifane Rallathil]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|10-15}}

==Notable Pseudodragons==
King [[Haedrak Rhindaun III]] of [[Tethyr]] had a platinum-colored pseudodragon named [[Purlakhonthiis]].
