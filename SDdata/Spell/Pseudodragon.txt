A pseudodragon was a small dragon-kin known to be playful.
Pseudodragons typically had bodies about  long, with a  tail and weighed about . They had chameleon-like abilities, though their color was usually a brownish red.
They could communicate telepathically in Common or Draconic and also through the vocalization of animal noises. While pseudodragons could bite, their main weapon was a stinging, poisonous tail. 
Their general attitude was similar to that of a small cat but with a cunning intelligence. They were wary of evil beings, but were willing to serve as a companion to another being if treated well and respected.
A pseudodragon often vocalizes animal noises. A rasping purr indicates pleasure, while a hiss means unpleasant surprise. A bird-like chirping represents desire, and a growl always means anger or discontent.
In the wild, pseudodragons often seek out quiet places to inhabit such as the hollows of trees and small caves. They are likely to be found in temperate forests.
They were sometimes dispatched in times of need by an array of deities including Brandobaris, Erevan Ilesere, Gond, Gwaeron Windstrom, Marthammor Duin, Mystra, and Rillifane Rallathil.
King Haedrak Rhindaun III of Tethyr had a platinum-colored pseudodragon named Purlakhonthiis.
