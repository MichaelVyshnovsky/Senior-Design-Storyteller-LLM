Catnap was a spell used by bards, sorcerers, and wizards that calmed multiple creatures into a restorative sleep. 
A caster used this spell on up to three willing creatures to render them unconscious for a short time. The target creatures had to be within  of the caster. After the spell expired, the creatures felt slightly rejuvenated, as if they had a short nap. If the creature was disturbed or hurt during the spells duration, the spell expired and the creature regained consciousness. A caster could target more creatures at once with this spell the amount of creatures was determined by the casters skill level.
In addition to a somatic component, the spell required a material component, a pinch of salt.
