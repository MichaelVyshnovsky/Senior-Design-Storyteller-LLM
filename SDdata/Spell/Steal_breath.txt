Steal breath was a divine spell that drained the air out of a targets lungs.
The caster could target any creature within  and attempt to force the air from their lungs. This defeated any effort the target might have been making to hold their breath, left them winded for a short time, and disrupted any spellcasting.
Steal breath did not affect creatures that did not need to breathe air. It could be countered by a casting of deep breath.
The spell was quick to cast, and required verbal and somatic components, as well as a material component a small animal bladder.
It was rare to encounter a cleric who knew the steal breath spell on Toril, although it was more common on Athas.
In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the material components for this spell could be purchased from places like Auroras Emporium for 5 copper pieces per bladder.
