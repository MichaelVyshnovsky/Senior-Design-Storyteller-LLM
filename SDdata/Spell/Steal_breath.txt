'''''Steal breath''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[spell]] that drained the air out of a target's lungs.

==Effects==
The caster could target any creature within {{SI|120|feet|long=yes}} and attempt to force the air from their lungs. This defeated any effort the target might have been making to hold their breath, left them winded for a short time, and disrupted any spellcasting.

''Steal breath'' did not affect creatures that did not need to breathe air. It could be countered by a casting of ''deep breath''.

==Components==
The spell was quick to cast, and required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, as well as a [[material component]]: a small animal [[bladder]].

==History==
It was rare to encounter a [[cleric]] who knew the ''steal breath'' spell on [[Toril]], although it was more common on [[Athas]].

In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the material components for this spell could be purchased from places like [[Aurora's Emporium]] for 5 [[copper piece]]s per bladder.
