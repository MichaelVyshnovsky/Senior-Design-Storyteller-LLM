Shock sphere is an evocation spell learned early in the training of several wizards that calls upon the elemental power of storm for its energy. When a wizard casts shock sphere she or he creates a sphere of crackling lightning and hurls it straight towards a spot within fifty feet of him or her. When the sphere reaches its destination it explodes, much like the simpler force orb spell, in a surge of electrical power over an area of five feet in diameter. A short rest is required of a wizard who seeks to recast the spell.
