        "mainbody": "Slow rot was an abjuration spell that prevented spoilage of fruits, vegetables, and grains for a few weeks.\nUp to 100 ft3 (2.83 m3) of plants, crops, or harvested goods per level of the caster could be kept free from decay for weeks. This spell did not work on meat, and pests could still consume the preserved plant material.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a pinch of sugar to cast.\nSlow rot dates back to the time of the first Netherese empire where it was known as a third-level druid spell of the terrestrial winds. It was also granted to specialty priests and favored servants of Moander to prolong their life as they were slowly corrupted from within."
