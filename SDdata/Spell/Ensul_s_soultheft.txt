'''''Ensul's soultheft''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that imbued the caster's left hand with a malevolent dark energy that allowed them to devastate the mind of any creature or person they touched and steal the life force.

==Effects==
When cast, the caster's left hand was surrounded with crackling black illumination. If they struck another being with the hand, the caster permanently drained them of their intellect. When this malevolent attack was successful, the caster was healed of any wounds they had incurred, and any [[poison]]s or toxins in their body were cleansed.

If the caster killed someone while attacking them in this manner, they could not be ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]'' or otherwise ''[[raise dead|raised]]'', unless these actions were made in conjunction with the spells ''[[wish]]'' or ''[[limited wish]]''.

This duration of this spell was a number of seconds, but extended longer depending on the skill and experience of the caster.

==Usage==
Common practice saw ''soultheft'' being used on restrained beings, so that the caster maximize the amount of time they extended their life.

==History==
The [[Netherese]] [[sorcerer]] [[Telbran Nelarn]] used this spell to extended his life for centuries, regularly trapping and killing evil spellcasters he believed that were praying upon the innocent.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a single drop of [[vampire blood]].
