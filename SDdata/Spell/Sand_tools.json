        "mainbody": "Sand tools was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was primarily used by mechanicians.\nMechanicians developed this spell so they would always have access to their special tools. This spell created a standard array of tools that sized themselves perfectly for the task at hand. The tools were formed from sand but had the strength and hardness of iron.\nThis spell could last for up to 8 hours, but the tools would revert back to regular sand if the job was finished before that time expired. Sand tools could not be carried with the caster.\nThis spell required a bagful of sand to cast."
