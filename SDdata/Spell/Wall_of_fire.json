The shape and the flaming side of the wall was determined by the caster and the maximum size of the wall was determined by the caster's level. The sheet of flame lasted for up to 1 minute, as long as the caster maintained concentration, or for a minimum time if the caster became distracted. or greenish-yellow to [[amber]] if created by divine magic. The wall was only {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} thick.\n\nAny creature near the flaming side of the wall was subject to harm from the heat, although the farther away, the less intense the heat. Any creature passing through the wall suffered greatly&mdash;[[undead]] and other creatures susceptible to fire got the worst of it. \n\nBetweeen the Spellplague and the Second Sundering, a ''wall of fire'' was limited to {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} in length, made up of {{SIAdj|5|ft}} orthogonal segments, and only lasted a few seconds. The range of this spell was {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}}. A creature passing through this version of ''wall of fire'' was also slowed by a few steps.",
