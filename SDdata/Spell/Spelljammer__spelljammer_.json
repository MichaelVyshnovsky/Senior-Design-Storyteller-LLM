        "Description": "The ''Spelljammer'' was shaped like a cross between a [[manta ray]] and a [[scorpion]]. It was enormous, almost twice as wide as it was long.\n\nThe ship was highly intelligent. Its advanced and alien intellect allowed it to move at spelljamming velocities and to cross between [[wildspace]] and the [[phlogiston]] at will. When doing so, it left permanent openings on [[crystal sphere]]s that could be used by other ships.\n\nNormal operation of the ''Spelljammer'' required no crew. It produced its own crew of constructs, known as [[w:c:spelljammer:shivak|shivaks]], to perform maintenance tasks. However, the ship could support a population of over 5,000 passengers of all races, who inhabited the various towers located in the citadel on the ship's back. The ship constantly emitted a [[magic]]al substance into its [[air envelope]] that caused all living creatures onboard to become [[charm]]ed by it. Unless the individual managed to resist the effect or if blocked by a ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[wall of force]]'', or ''[[antimagic]]'' [[spell]], the ''Spelljammer'' inspired all onboard to defend it and prevent anyone from harming it. It also made it impossible for a charmed creature to leave the ship voluntarily.",
        "History": "The origin of the ''Spelljammer'' was surrounded by myth and legend. No precise records were known, but it was believed to be as old as the crystal spheres themselves.\n\nThe ''Spelljammer'' first received its name from the [[elves]], and all other spelljammers were named after it.\n\nThe ''Spelljammer'' visited [[Toril]] in the [[623 DR|Year of Nightsilver, 623 DR]]. It was seen by [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] gliding over the waters on [[Evermeet]]'s northern coast.\n\nThe ''Spelljammer'' was once sighted over [[Kara-Tur]], on an unknown date in the 32{{nd}} year of the reign of an emperor of [[Shou Lung]], as recorded by the emperor's scribe, [[Lu Pi]]. The emperor, who saw the ''Spelljammer'' himself, ordered Lu Pi to search for the ship and bring it for his personal collection.\n\nSome time before the 13{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Krynn]]ish [[gnome]] [[Judd Oskoshtormirange]] witnessed the destruction of a ''Spelljammer'' at the hands of the [[neogi]]. Judd, at the time a slave on board one of the neogi ships, reported that the neogi assault required a fleet of over fifty ships, most of which were destroyed, considerably weakening the neogi presence in wildspace ever since.",

        "Inhabitants": "* [[Austinius Corbundium]], a [[satyr]] from the [[Elven Court]] who was forcibly [[Summon monster|summoned]] by a group of adventurers and brought to wildspace. He later lived in transit between different places, including the [[Rock of Bral]], until he finally set up residence on the ''Spelljammer'', where he lived as a [[priest]] known as \"Father Goat\".\n* An enclave of approximately 80 [[human]]s from Shou Lung led by [[Si Loo]] inhabited the [[Shou Tower]] in the Citadel district of the ''Spelljammer''. They considered themselves \"pure\" and racially superior to other humans, including [[Shou]] and [[Wa]] inhabitants of other districts.",
        "Ecology": "[[File:Smalljammer-2e.jpg|thumb|300px|''A smalljammer, the ''Spelljammer's'' offspring.'']]\nThe ''Spelljammer'' was a living ship. As such, it reproduced by creating smaller versions of itself: ships known as [[smalljammer]]s. The ship could only create these smaller spacecraft when a captain, chosen by the ship itself, was in command of its [[spelljamming helm]]. During a captain's tenure, the ''Spelljammer'' created about 100 smalljammers. When in the phlogiston, the ship released its young, in an event known as \"the Flight\". The smalljammers then spread to as many [[crystal sphere]]s as possible, in the hope that a few of them might survive long enough to reach maturity.\n\nIn the event of the destruction of the ''Spelljammer'', a signal of its death was propagated through the [[Ethereal plane]] until it reached the nearest smalljammer. It then grew to become a full-sized ''Spelljammer'', identical to its predecessor, within one year. Only one adult ''Spelljammer'' existed at any given time."
