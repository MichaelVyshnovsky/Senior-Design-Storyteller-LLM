'''''Spidercloak armor''''' was an [[arcane]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]], used in the [[Underdark]], which surrounded the caster in a dark network of magic shadows and non-sticking webs.

==Effects==
The magical dark network acted as a barrier to both physical and magical attacks. Whilst under effect of the spell, the caster's [[armor]] would be raised significantly, and could become strengthened over time, as it fluctuated. 

The spell also cloaked the caster's [[alignment]] aura, such that another spellcasters couldn't tell whether they were [[good]] or [[evil]]. Any other magical auras were also cloaked.

==Components==
As well as [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components, the material component could be either a [[spider]] web part or a living spider itself. The living spider would be crushed to death in the process.
