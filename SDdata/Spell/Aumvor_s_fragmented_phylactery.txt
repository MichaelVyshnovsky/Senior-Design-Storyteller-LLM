'''''Aumvor's fragmented phylactery''''' was a [[spell]] of [[epic magic]] that only [[lich]]es could cast.

==Effects==
Normally, liches had only one [[phylactery]]. To permanently destroy a lich, a person needed to destroy both the lich and the phylactery. ''Aumvor's fragmented phylactery'' allowed a caster to expand the number of phylacteries, thus forcing the lich's enemies to destroy all phylacteries, so permanently destroying the lich became almost impossible.

''Aumvor's fragmented phylactery'' could be used in either of two ways. The spell could be cast on an existing phylactery to split it into multiple ones or it could be cast to create various items to be turned into phylacteries. While this spell could be cast various times, there was a limit to how many phylacteries could be created at once; the number depended on the caster's power behind the spell.

==Components==
''Aumvor's fragmented phylactery'' required [[somatic component|somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s to cast. Casting it took an entire minute.

==History==
''Aumvor's fragmented phylactery'' was a product of [[Aumvor]]'s research in epic magic. It was developed after the [[Fall of Netheril]].

He used the spell on his phylactery, a rune-scribed skeleton of his former rival [[Dethed]], an apprentice of [[Ioulaum]]. He cast it so often that the skeleton's 206 bones were phylacteries. Most of them were shrouded from [[divination]] magic and scattered around the [[Endless Caverns]] and other places, but most were in the former place.
