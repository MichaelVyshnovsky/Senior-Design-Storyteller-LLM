        "mainbody": "Divine romantic interest was a spell used by clerics of Hanali Celanil.\nWhen cast, this spell allowed the caster to determine the romantic interest (or interests) of a targeted creature. The spell worked best when the caster touched a willing creature. The spell was unable to reveal to the caster if the targeted creature had a romantic interest in the caster.\nThis spell required only a somatic component."
