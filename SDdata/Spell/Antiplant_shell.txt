'''''Antiplant shell''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that protected the caster and all creatures within a short distance from animated plants and plant creatures.

==Effects==
This spell created an invisible barrier at a radius from the caster than moved as the caster moved. All creatures within the ''shell'' were protected from melee or missile attack by plant-based lifeforms and magically animated plants. The size of the ''shell'' varied from generation to generation with the earliest druids casting a 15 to 16 ft (4.6 to 4.9 m) diameter barrier, whereas later druids improved the spell to a 20 ft (6.1 m) diameter. Any attempt to force the shell up against an abjured creature caused the ''shell'' to collapse. The protection lasted for 10 minutes per experience level of the caster.

==Components==
Only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were required to cast this spell. Though earlier versions required [[mistletoe]] as a [[material component]].
