Antiplant shell was an abjuration spell that protected the caster and all creatures within a short distance from animated plants and plant creatures.
This spell created an invisible barrier at a radius from the caster than moved as the caster moved. All creatures within the shell were protected from melee or missile attack by plant-based lifeforms and magically animated plants. The size of the shell varied from generation to generation with the earliest druids casting a 15 to 16 ft (4.6 to 4.9 m) diameter barrier, whereas later druids improved the spell to a 20 ft (6.1 m) diameter. Any attempt to force the shell up against an abjured creature caused the shell to collapse. The protection lasted for 10 minutes per experience level of the caster.
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. Though earlier versions required mistletoe as a material component.
