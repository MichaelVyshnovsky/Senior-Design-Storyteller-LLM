        "mainbody": "Chilling blow was a swordmage spell of the transmutation school, most commonly used by those of the shielding style. When cast, chilling blow instilled the swordmages weapon with magical cold, so that the wound they left froze instantly, causing the target a level of pain proportional to the swordmages intellect.
