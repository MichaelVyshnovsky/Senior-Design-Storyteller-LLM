        "mainbody": "'''''Chilling blow''''' was a [[swordmage]] [[spell]] of the [[transmutation|transmutation school]], most commonly used by those of the [[Swordmage#Shielding Swordmage|shielding]] style. When cast, ''chilling blow'' instilled the swordmage's weapon with [[magic]]al cold, so that the wound they left froze instantly, causing the target a level of pain proportional to the swordmage's intellect. This frozen flesh continued to injure its owner for a short while afterward; precisely how much dependent upon the vitality of the swordmage in question. The spell was not particularly complex and it could be recast after a short rest of at least a few minutes.",
