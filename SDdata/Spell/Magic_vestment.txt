Magic vestment, were transmutation or enchantment spells respectively, that improved the armor value of clothing, a shield, or a suit of armor.
Though similar in effect, the two versions of this spell were different in practice. The transmutation version could be cast on anyones clothing, armor, or a shield as long as the caster could touch the targeted vestment. The enchantment version only worked on the caster. The transmutation version lasted for hours while the enchantment version lasted for only 25 to 100 minutes or so. However, the improvement in armor was better in most cases for the enchantment version.
Starting with plain clothes or robes, the enchantment version immediately granted protection equivalent to chain mail and increased up to field plate armor as the level of the caster increased. For the transmutation version, the lowest level improvement was equivalent to donning padded armor and increased up to chain mail as the level of the caster increased. However, the enchantment version was not cumulative with existing armor, so magical vestment was only worth casting if the result was better than what the caster was already wearing, whereas magic vestment improved any existing armor or shield.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the casters holy symbol or divine focus to cast.
