'''''Spell-lash''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that completely destroyed the body of the caster.

==Effects==
Upon casting this spell, the caster was engulfed in a massive explosion that radiated outward 25' (7.6 m). Their physical body was destroyed in its entirety, and anything or anyone caught in the blast received considerable damage.

While the [[spellcaster|spellcaster's]] physical form was completely consumed in the spell, their essence could be preserved by means of a ''[[clone (spell)|clone]]'' or ''[[magic jar]]''.

==Usage==
This spell was known to the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] and used in the rare instances when they faced the real threat of being captured or killed outright.
