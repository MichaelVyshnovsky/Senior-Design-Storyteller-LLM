        "mainbody": "Erase was transmutation spell that caused mundane and magical writing to disappear.\nCasting this spell wiped a scroll or two pages of paper, parchment, or the like clean of all writing, whether mundane or magical. This could remove arcane marks, explosive runes, glyphs of warding, and sepia snake sigils, but not illusory script or symbol spells. Mundane writing was erased automatically if nearby (within 30 feet (9.1 meters)) and not in someones hand, or with a 90% success rate otherwise. Magical writing had to be touched by the caster, and their casting skill determined whether the erasure was successful or not. If an attempt failed to erase explosive runes, a glyph of warding, or a sepia snake sigil, they were activated instead.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Raliteff in the  and was originally known as Raliteffs strike.\nCasting some versions of this spell required a sample of rubber plant sap as a material component.\nAccording to the Book of the Silver Talon, the ingredients for the ink used to inscribe erase into spellbooks were one ounce of giant squid sepia, an ounce of acid, three dozen crushed caraway seeds, one chrysolite, and one black pearl. The gems would be dissolved in the acid over the period of two days. After this, the acid was heated in an elven-made bronze tureen with the seeds being added after it was brought to a boil. This would neutralize the acid allowing the mixture to be cooled and mixed with the sepia."
