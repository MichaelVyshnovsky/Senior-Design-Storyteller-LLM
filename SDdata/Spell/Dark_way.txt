'''''Dark way''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Mask]].

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created an unbreakable bridge. The bridge looked like a ribbon and was weightless. It could be at any angle but it had to be solidly anchored at both ends and continuous. The bridge could support up to {{SI|200|lb|k|long=yes}}. This maximum weight increased as the caster's skill level grew.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[divine focus]].
