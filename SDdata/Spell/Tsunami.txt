'''Tsunami''' was a [[conjuration]] spell that summoned a massive wave. The spell was very rare outside [[Kara-Tur]],

==Effects==
The caster was only able to cast this spell on a large body of water, such as an ocean or a large lake. The summoned tsunami acted in the same way a natural occurring one would. The wave travelled in the direction chosen by the caster. Wooden buildings and ships caught in the wave were destroyed. 

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components. In addition, the [[wu jen]] version of this spell required [[material component]]s, a scale from either a [[li lung]] or a [[tun mi lung]], which was mixed with water from a [[water elemental]].
