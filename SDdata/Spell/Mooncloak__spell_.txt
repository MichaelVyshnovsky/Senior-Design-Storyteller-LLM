'''''Mooncloak''''' was an [[abjuration]] and [[evocation]] [[wizard]] [[spell]].

==Effects==
The caster could cloak themselves or another recipient within eyesight with moonlight. Anyone within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} of the recipient enjoyed special protection against cold, lightning and any attack that drained their knowledge of skills. The recipient could also choose to forget a memorized spell in exchange for healing magic. The recipient and one other target of their choosing could be healed in this manner.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a [[moonstone]] or other valuable [[gem]]stone to cast. This spell would only function at night under moonlight.
