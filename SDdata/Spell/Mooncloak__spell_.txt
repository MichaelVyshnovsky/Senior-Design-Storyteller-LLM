The caster could cloak themselves or another recipient within eyesight with moonlight. Anyone within  of the recipient enjoyed special protection against cold, lightning and any attack that drained their knowledge of skills. The recipient could also choose to forget a memorized spell in exchange for healing magic. The recipient and one other target of their choosing could be healed in this manner.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a moonstone or other valuable gemstone to cast. This spell would only function at night under moonlight.
