Lively step was a spell used by bards, sorcerers and wizards.
When cast, this spell increased the speed of affected creatures by 33% to 50% for 12 hours, unless the spell was ended prematurely by taking any action other than movement. It affected allied creatures within  from the caster. The spell possibly also affected all forms of movement, not just walking or running, such as climbing, flying, swimming or burrowing.
An elvish version of the spell was known to the bards and mages of Myth Drannor. It could be cast using Ruehars flute and it affected all elves and half-elves who heard the melody, giving them improved speed for running, dancing, and other types of movement, however, it was not usable in battle.
This spell required verbal and somatic components, as well as a small drum as an arcane focus.
