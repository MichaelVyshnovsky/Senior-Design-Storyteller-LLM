'''''Golden dragonmail''''' was a spell used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a suit of  of radiant golden [[plate mail]] on the caster. Sketched on the plates were patterns of dragonscale, mimicking a [[gold dragon]]. The caster could also choose to have the symbol of Torm sketched on the plate. If the caster removed the suit of armor, or it was destroyed, the spell expired. If the caster was already wearing armor, the spell had no effect.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, a [[coin]] of solid [[gold]] and [[mithral]] in the shape of a dragonscale.
