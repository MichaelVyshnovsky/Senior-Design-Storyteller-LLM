'''''Firefeed''''' was a strange [[wizard]] spell that combined the element of [[fire]] with healing.{{Cite dragon/268/Secrets of the Brotherhood of the True Flame}}

==Effects==
The caster of this spell could heal himself by physically touching a flame. The intensity of the flame determined the amount of healing granted to the caster, with higher intensity fires granting more healing. The fire was immediately extinguished once the caster touched the flame to receive the healing effects.
