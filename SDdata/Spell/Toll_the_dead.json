        "mainbody": "'''''Toll the dead''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[cantrip]] that drained the life force of creatures, especially ones who had been recently hurt.",
        "Effects": "By pointing at a target within a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}, the spell filled the air around the creature with the sound of a slowly sounding bell in a funeral toll. A creature unable to resist the spell's effect suffered an immediate drain in life force that increased as the caster grew more powerful. Although fully healthy creatures could be damaged by ''toll the dead'', the spell was considerably more effective on injured targets.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
