'''''Ramael's cyclical light''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Halruaa]].

==Effects==
This spell was similar to the ''[[continual light]]'' spell, but it faded and glowed with exterior light. This spell could only be cast upon an object.

An the object used during casting glowed brightly when placed in a darkened area. If placed in a medium lit area, the item would dim the light over several minutes so that it was not overbearing.

==Components==
This spell could be cast without physical components, at which point it mimicked the ''continual light'' spell. If cast with a gemstones worth at least 10 [[gp]], the light produced would appear as the same color as the gemstone.
