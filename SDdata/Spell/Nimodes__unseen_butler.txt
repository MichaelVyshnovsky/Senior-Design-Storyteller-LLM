Nimodes unseen butler was a stronger version of the unseen servant spell.
The spell created a more powerful unseen servant that raced like a whirlwind. The spell straightened, swept, buffed, polished, cleaned and waxed along the area of effect, about  at the very least. The spell was so powerful that it usually finished the tasks within three or four minutes.
The spell called for verbal and somatic components, and as a material component, it called for a bit of string and a drop of oil.
After creating the spell, Nimodes sold it to enterprising hedge wizards far and wide the spell was now found all across Faer√ªn, from Cormyr to Kara-Tur.
