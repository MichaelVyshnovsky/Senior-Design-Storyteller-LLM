'''''Nimodes' unseen butler''''' was a stronger version of the ''[[unseen servant]]'' spell.

==Effects==
The spell created a more powerful ''[[unseen servant]]'' that raced like a whirlwind. The spell straightened, swept, buffed, polished, cleaned and waxed along the area of effect, about {{SI|300|sq ft|long=yes}} at the very least. The spell was so powerful that it usually finished the tasks within three or four minutes.

==Components==
The spell called for [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, and as a material component, it called for a bit of string and a drop of oil.

==History==
After creating the spell, [[Nimodes]] sold it to enterprising hedge wizards far and wide; the spell was now found all across Faer√ªn, from [[Cormyr]] to [[Kara-Tur]].
