Sylunés absolute immunity was a wizard spell from the school of abjuration.The Seven Sisters (sourcebook) lists this as an alteration spell and the Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four lists it under abjuration which makes more sense given the spells effects. This spell was created by Syluné Silverhand.
This spell completely protected the caster from one particular spell for days at a time depending on the skill of the caster. Additionally, absolute immunity granted an extra degree of resistance to other spells similar to the selected spell.
The caster could only be protected by one absolute immunity spell at a time. The second casting of absolute immunity would replace the selected spell with the new one, or extend the duration of the spell if it was the same as the first selection.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast.
