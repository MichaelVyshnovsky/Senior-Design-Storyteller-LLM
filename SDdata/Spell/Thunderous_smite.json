        "mainbody": "Thunderous smite was a spell used by paladins.\nThis spell was cast while the caster wielded a melee weapon. The weapon became temporarily enhanced and emitted thunder when used immediately after the spell was cast. The thunder was extremely loud and could be heard up to 300 feet (91 meters) from the caster. Creatures within the spells area of effect were knocked over and suffered thunder damage.\nThis spell required only a verbal component."
