The non-magical weapon became a +1 magical beast bane spear for the duration of the spell, until the caster canceled it, or until the caster gave up the weapon (willingly or otherwise) to another, whichever came first. If the spear of Lurue broke, the spell and the original weapon also broke.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.
