        "Effects": "A ''forcecage'' spell created an immovable, invisible prison composed of pure [[force]], similar to a ''[[wall of force]]''. It could take one of two forms, as chosen by the caster. The first was a barred cage, a 20-foot-wide (6.1 meters) cube made of 0.5-inch-wide (1.3 centimeters) bars the same distance apart. The other was a windowless cell, only 10 feet wide (3 meters) but lacking any gaps or exits.{{Cite comic/Sorcerer's Moon|5, 12, 18}}\n\nAny creature within the affected area at the time of casting was trapped inside, unless they were too large (in which case the spell failed), or they could pass through the slits in the barred cage. It was also possible to escape with ''[[teleportation]]'' spells or [[astral projection|astral travel]], though the force blocked ethereal travel.\n\nA captive could still use spells or breath weapons through the barred cage, and weapons could potentially fit through.\n\nThe ''forcecage'' was immune to ''[[dispel magic]]'', but it could be destroyed with ''[[disintegrate]]'', or with a ''[[sphere of annihilation]]'' or a ''[[rod of cancellation]]''. It usually lasted a matter of hours, according to the power of the caster, unless dismissed ahead of time. However, a ''forcecage'' could also fade with the death of its caster.",
        "Material components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required 1,500 [[gp]] worth of [[ruby]] dust, which had to be thrown into the air and vanished after the spell was cast.",
        "Users": "The ''forcecage'' spell could be cast by [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s, and [[cleric]]s who commanded the [[craft domain|craft]] domain.",
        "History": "The spell was named for [[Valdick]], and it was introduced in [[-1811 DR|2048 NY (−1811 DR)]] under the name ''Valdick's forcecage''. It later became known simply as ''forcecage''.\n\n''Forcecage'' was a common spell in [[Faerûn]] in the 1360s [[DR]].",
        "Notable Uses": "[[File:Lunatics - forcecage.jpg|thumb|right|''Timoth and Onyx find themselves trapped in a ''forcecage'' with a bunch of Lunatics.'']]\nIn the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], the extraplanar [[magic-user]] [[Imgig Zu]] placed his captive [[Cybriana]] inside an ornate ''forcecage'' during his Great Awakening of his bound people. Trapped inside, Cybriana was unable to stop him, but was able to use a simple ''[[bloom]]'' spell, scattering flowers outside to form a trail for her friends. The ''forcecage'' faded with Imgig's death, allowing her to escape.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], [[Luna]] cast a ring-shaped ''forcecage'' to trap herself, her fellow [[Swords of the Lady|Lunatics]], and [[Onyx the Invincible|Onyx]] and [[Timoth Eyesbright|Timoth]] outside the [[House of the Moon]].{{Cite comic/Lunatics|19-22}}"
