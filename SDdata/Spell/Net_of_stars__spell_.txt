'''''Net of stars''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the school of [[evocation]].

==Effects==
This spell created swirling cluster of small stars around the caster that could be used to strike out against targets or spin around the caster to serve as a shield. The caster decided during the casting if the spell would behave in an offensive or defensive manner and could not be changed once cast. The caster was unable to work other magic while wielding the ''net of stars'' as a lash, but could perform mundane actions while using the net as a shield.

The stars always hit their target when lashing out. Any targets touched by others coming to their aid shared in the harmful effects. The lash was fan-shaped and {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} wide at its base and {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} wide at its end and {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} thick. It could extend for {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} from the caster.

When stationary, the net filled an area {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} wide and tall. The use of magic within this area was blocked by the spell's energy. The caster was immune to harm from the net, but the energy within the net harmed anything that was both within the net's boundary or when attempting to cross the boundary.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s an eyelash from a wizard who had cast a [[wild magic]] spell and a small powdered [[diamond]], [[moonstone]] or piece of rock crystal to cast.
