        "Effects": "This spell enveloped either the caster or a willing target with shimmering colors that changed with the target's mood. A ''rainbow shield'' was used in conjunction with one other mid-power harmful spell, such as ''[[fireball]],'' which was cast into the shield. The ''rainbow shield'' would reflect the effect of the harmful spell back to anything that attempted to physically harm the target while the shield endured. This reflective strike did not occur if the shield recipient was attacked with missiles or other magical strikes.The caster was unable to recast the selected harmful spell while the ''rainbow shield'' remained active.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s an iridescent shell to cast."
