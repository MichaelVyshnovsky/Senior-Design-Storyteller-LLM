'''''Mass drown''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that drowned the targets to death.

==Effects==
On casting ''mass drown'', the targets' lungs filled with [[water]]. Barring having a hale body that resisted its lungs being filled with water in the first place, the targets fell unconscious on the spot and, if left alone, died. It was impossible for the targets to get rid of the water by means of natural reactions like coughing, only the able medical help from another person could save the targets' life.

Naturally, to creatures who did not need to breathe or who could breathe in water, this spell was harmless.

==Components==
''Mass drown'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s and a [[divine focus]]. The somatic component was a sign of the wave pointed at each target.
