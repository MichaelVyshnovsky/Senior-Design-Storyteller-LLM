'''''Seeking''''' was an [[arcane magic|arcane]] [[enchantment]] and [[invocation]] [[spell]] that slightly twisted the laws of gravity and momentum in the caster's favor.

==Effects==
The magic of this spell affected a number of nonmagical missiles no larger than a [[javelin]]. The number of missiles affected depended on the skill of the caster, to a maximum of five. The enchanted missiles could be used by the caster or someone they selected.

When directed at a target within the missiles' normal range, they would unerringly seek their target, moving around objects in their path to strike true. The missiles could not pass through solid barriers. If the missiles were fired when the target was within their normal range, they would continue to follow the target if they moved beyond the missiles' range by non-magical methods. The missiles would instantly drop to the ground if their target transported themselves via magic.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.

==History==
This was a jealously guarded spell used commonly by [[elves]] on [[Evermeet]].
