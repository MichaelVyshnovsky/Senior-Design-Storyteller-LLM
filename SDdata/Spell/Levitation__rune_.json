        "mainbody": "evitation was a type of giant rune that functioned similarly to the levitate spell.\nThe levitation runes effect generally had a duration of thirty minutes. A caster could study this rune extensively for an unlimited number of times and each instance of studying would contribute an extra thirty minutes to the effects duration.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to twenty minutes.\nIn the valley of Hartsvale in 1366 DR, Tavis Burdun and the runecaster Basil went out into the woods in search of Brianna Hartwick and discovered the aftermath of an ambush, including the bloody body of her bodyguard Morten. They soon determined that he was still be alive, albeit critically injured. Realizing they needed a way to transport Mortens large body back to Castle Hartwick, Basil shaved the mans hairy chest and then used the fresh blood oozing from his bandaged neck to paint the levitation rune upon the former. Trailing behind them as they made their way there, Mortens floating body eventually reached the castle and was left in the hands of the High Priest Simon."
