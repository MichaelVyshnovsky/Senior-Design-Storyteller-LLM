        "mainbody": "'''''Create major helm''''' was a [[spell]] that created a ''[[spelljamming helm|major spelljamming helm]]''.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the caster altered a regular chair into a major spelljamming helm. This effect was temporary and was often reserved for emergencies. The spell was also infrequently used as it aged the caster by a whole year. The size of the [[spelljammer]] the helm could power was three times the caster's skill level.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], any seat suitable for use as a helm."
