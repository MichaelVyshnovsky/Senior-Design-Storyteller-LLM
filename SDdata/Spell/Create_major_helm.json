        "mainbody": "Create major helm was a spell that created a major spelljamming helm.\nWhen cast, the caster altered a regular chair into a major spelljamming helm. This effect was temporary and was often reserved for emergencies. The spell was also infrequently used as it aged the caster by a whole year. The size of the spelljammer the helm could power was three times the casters skill level.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, any seat suitable for use as a helm."
