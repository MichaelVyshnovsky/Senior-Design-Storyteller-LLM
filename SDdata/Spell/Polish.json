        "mainbody": "'''''Polish''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that apprentice [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It improved the smoothness of the surfaces of various materials, enhancing their luster.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip could be applied to ceramic, crystal, leather, metal, stone, or wood surfaces. Up to {{SI|1000|sq ft|long=yes}} could be affected, but the smaller the area (such as a pair of boots, a mirror, or a single piece of furniture), the more effective the spell. The target had to be fairly clean for this cantrip to work, so the ''[[clean]]'' cantrip was often employed before ''polish''. After casting, the surface gleamed with improved reflectivity and/or luster. Like similar cantrips, the target had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster hummed a little tune while making circular motions with an open palm."
