'''''Disguise self''''', also known as '''''change self''''', was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that changed one's appearance. This spell was originally called '''''Quantoul's changer''''' in the days of the first [[Netherese]] empire.

==Effects==
The caster's appearance changed, including facial features, skin, clothing, armor, weapons, and accoutrements. The caster could appear up to 1 ft (30 cm) shorter or taller, fat or thin, or anywhere within this range. The caster could not change body type, i.e., a [[human]] caster had to stay generally humanoid-shaped and bipedal. Apart from this, the apparent changes were at the discretion of the caster, ranging from an obscure feature to an entirely new look. Skin blemishes, scars, facial hair, hair color, complexion, and gender changes were all possible.

''Disguise self'' did not disguise the caster's voice nor change the audible properties of armor or equipment. [[Chain mail]] could be made to look like a leather [[jerkin]], but it would still sound like chain mail when the caster moved. Likewise, the tactile properties of materials were not altered. If someone slapped you on the back, they would feel chain mail and not leather. The spell also did not give the caster any new abilities or knowledge of the mannerisms of the chosen form.

This spell lasted for one hour or less if the caster wished to end the illusion. The early versions, known as ''change self'', only lasted a few minutes and maximum duration depended on the caster's power.
==Components==
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.

==As a natural ability==
Some [[deep gnome]]s could perform this spell innately.

==History==
This spell was invented by the [[Netherese]] [[archmage]] [[Quantoul]] in [[-2018 DR|&ndash;2018 DR]] (1841 NR, during Netheril's [[Golden Age of Netheril|Golden Age]]). It was a basic spell in the schools of [[Variation]] and [[Mentalism]].
