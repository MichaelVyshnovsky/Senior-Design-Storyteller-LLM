'''''critical word of nurturing''''' was a very advanced [[utterance]] from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind that used [[truespeak]] to rejuvenate a target from its wounds, or to rend them apart utterly, if reversed.

==Usage==
In its straight form, healing energy suffused the target, slowly repairing them of a massive amount of damage. In its reversed form, it rended and tore at the target; it could last for an instant, but with some concentration, damage would be doubled after a few seconds.{{cite book/Tome of Magic 3.5|247-248}}

==History==
The recitation was known to [[logokron devil]]s.{{cite book/Tome of Magic 3.5|266}}
