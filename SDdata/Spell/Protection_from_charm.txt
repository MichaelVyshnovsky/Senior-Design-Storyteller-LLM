Protection from charm was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur to defend against certain enchantments. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, the spell protected a wu jen from charm-based magic.  
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a piece of a very charming creature.
