'''Castle Ravenloft''' was the seat of power of the lord of [[Barovia]], the [[vampire]] Count [[Strahd von Zarovich]].

==Location==
The castle was located atop a large spire of rock overlooking the village of Barovia.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1098}}, the [[sun elf]] vampire [[Jander Sunstar]] first traveled to Castle Ravenloft while trying to solve the mystery of the magical affliction that had tormented [[Anna]], whom he had met in [[Waterdeep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1072}}. He lived there for more than 25 years, until his final confrontation with Strahd.

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], it was the intention of [[Volothamp Geddarm]] to visit Castle Ravenloft during his brief stay in Barovia. After being invited into the castle by Strahd himself, Volo, realizing the danger he was in, returned to [[Toril]] by way of a charm devised by [[Elminster]].{{Cite dragon+/6/Travel Talk: Volo's Visit to Barovia}}

==Inhabitants==
Besides Strahd himself, Castle Ravenloft was inhabited by several of his [[undead]] servants, thralls, and, occasionally, prisoners.
