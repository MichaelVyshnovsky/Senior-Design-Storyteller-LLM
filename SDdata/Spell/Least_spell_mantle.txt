Least spell mantle was a spell used by clerics, sorcerers and wizards.
When cast, this spell created a magical barrier around the caster. This barrier absorbed almost any low-level spell thrown at it. The barrier remained in place until the spell expired or it reached the maximum amount of spells it could absorb.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
