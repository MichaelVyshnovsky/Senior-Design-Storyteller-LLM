        "mainbody": "'''''Dance of pain''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Loviatar]], enabling them to summon illusory blades around an injured target.",
        "Effects": "This spell summoned illusory blades around a target injured within the past day.  The spell would not function on a healthy target. The blades whirled rapidly around the target in a spiral, jostling them about with a frantic dance that made it impossible for the target to perform any intricate tasks while also slicing into their flesh.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast."
