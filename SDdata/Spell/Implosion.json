        "mainbody": "'''''Implosion''''' was a powerful [[divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] that slew creatures outright.",
        "Effects": "By creating a destructive resonance effect in the body of a creature, ''implosion'' made the target collapse into itself and die. The effect was instantaneous; it could not be [[Dispel magic|dispelled]], but could be resisted by fantastic fortitude. While only one creature could be targeted within several seconds, and none could be targeted twice, it lasted up to 102 seconds, longer for more experienced casters. Only corporeal creatures could be slain; gaseous and incorporeal creatures were unaffected.",
        "Components": "It needed only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
