        "mainbody": "'''''Beast tattoo''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[spell]] granted to followers of the [[elven]] [[deity]] [[Fenmarel Mestarine]], the Lone Wolf. It granted the caster a temporary boost to the characteristic associated with the creature represented by a [[tattoo]] on the caster's body.",
        "Effects": "The caster had to have a tattoo on their body of a creature that was culturally associated with a particular characteristic. For example, if the caster's culture believed that [[bear]]s represented strength, then casting ''beast tattoo'' on their skin decoration of a bear granted them a boost in strength for one hour (longer for more experienced casters). A priest could not augment themselves beyond the best example of their kind. So for the strength example, the caster could not become stronger than the strongest non-augmented elf.",
        "Components": "This spell require [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s as well as the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast. A tattoo of a creature representing the desired characteristic had to exist on the caster's body and it was not consumed in the casting of the spell."
