        "Effects": "The immense evil power of a ''divine curse'' could only be used against someone who had committed a great act of evil that affected the caster. The caster selected the specifics of the curse, so their wording when casting the spell needed to be precise. A ''divine curse'' could only be removed by an ''[[atonement]]'' spell or if the wording of the spell left some kind of escape clause.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the [[priest]]'s [[holy symbol]] and a [[silver]] gong to cast.",
        "History": "[[Myrkyssa Jelan]], a warlord in [[the Vast]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], had her ability to wield [[magic]] taken away by a ''divine curse''."
