Trebbes scry magic was a weak arcanist spell from the Field of mentalism. It was developed in Netheril by the archwizard Trebbe in 1589 NY (âˆ’2270 DR).
Knowledge of its effect was lost in later ages, so that its relation to the spell of similar name and equally small power, detect magic, remained unclear.Trebbes scry magic was supposed to be detailed in the Encyclopedia Arcana book from Netheril Empire of Magic, but was missing there.
