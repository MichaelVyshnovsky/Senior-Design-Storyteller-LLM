Create lantern archon was a type of sanctified spell.
When cast, this spell created a lantern archon. The lantern archon held allegiance and served the casters deity. The caster had no control over the lantern archon but it was friendly and saw the caster as an ally.
It would perform a single task for the caster, but with conditions. The task had to take less than an hour to perform and could not be hazardous to the lantern archon. The caster could, if they required it, bargain with the lantern archon to perform a dangerous task for a payment, similar to lesser planar ally. Once the task was completed, the lantern archon was sent to the casters deitys plane.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a divine focus and a sacrifice of the casters life force.
