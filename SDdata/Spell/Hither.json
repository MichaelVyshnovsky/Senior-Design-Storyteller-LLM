        "mainbody": "Hither was a rare arcane spell from the conjuration school of magic, used by roguish wizards on the world of Oerth to fetch items from a distance.\nWhen cast, hither made one object of the mages choosing leap forth into their hands unerringly from somewhere on their person. The size and weight of the item summoned via the spell depended on the casters size and strength â€“ it affected only items that the caster could comfortably hold in their hands. These items could only be of a non-magical nature. In a similar manner, the object could be returned via the hither spell into the casters pockets, bags, scabbards, or other places of their choosing. When an item was called via this spell, items moved from and to without disturbing any other objects, leaving bags closed, coins or keys silent, etc. The hither spell could be done silently or accompanied by an audible swoosh, a melodic chime, or a flash of light, as desired by the caster.\nHither required only verbal components to be cast.\nThe Hither spell was known to Rautheene of Greyhawk, and it was among the spells exchanged between the members of The Wizards Three during their visit to Earth and raiding larders of Ed Greenwood of Canada. The spell was brought over to the world of Toril by Elminster of Shadowdale, a member of the same de facto group."
