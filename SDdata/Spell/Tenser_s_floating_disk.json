        "mainbody": "Tensers floating disk, also written as Tensers floating disc was an evocation spell that created a floating disk.\nTo Zakharan mages, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as floating disc, and counted among the spells of the universal province.\nOn casting Tensers floating disk, a slightly concave circular disk made of force appeared floating about  above the ground. Its carrying capacity increased with the casters skill where weight was concerned its carrying capacity regarding liquids stayed static at (7.6 litres). By default, the disk followed behind the caster at a distance of about , but it could be ordered to float to anywhere. The disk and the caster needed to be within a certain distance that grew with the casters skill otherwise, the disk simply disappeared and the contents fell on the ground.\nCasting Tensers floating disk required somatic, verbal, and material components. The last was a drop of mercury.\nThe twin brothers Tarik and Chaid al Farid al Fuqani, young apprentices at Blackstaff Tower, used floating disks to destroy an invading nishruu on Uktar 28 of  by dumping salt upon the creature."
