        "mainbody": "'''''Earthshake''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Geb]] called [[Earthchildren]].",
        "Effects": "Though weaker than the ''[[earthquake]]'' spell, ''earthshake'' was able to target specific areas of effect with precision. This spell caused a localized tremor to shake the ground, violently throwing anyone caught nearby to the ground. Buildings and other structures were damaged to the point of collapsing into rubble. Earthchildren could cooperatively use this spell to greater effect if cast upon the same targeted area.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a handful of gravel and the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast."
