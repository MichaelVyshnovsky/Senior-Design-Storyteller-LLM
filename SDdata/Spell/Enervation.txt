Enervation was a necromancy spell that severely weakened the subject.
Speaking the incantation, the caster pointed at their target and fired from their finger a bolt of negative energy, black and crackling. If it hit, the targets life force was suppressed.
The spell had a chance to kill its target or it could weaken the targets offensive capability, skills and spellcasting ability. Assuming the subject survived, he regained lost power after a number of hours.
If the ray struck an undead creature, it temporarily increased the creatures un-lifeforce.
The spell required verbal and somatic components.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Stoca in  and was originally called Stocas feign.
