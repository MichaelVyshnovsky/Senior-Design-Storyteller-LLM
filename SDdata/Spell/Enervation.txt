'''''Enervation''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that severely weakened the subject.

==Effect==
Speaking the incantation, the caster pointed at their target and fired from their finger a bolt of [[negative energy]], black and crackling. If it hit, the target's life force was suppressed.

The spell had a chance to kill its target or it could weaken the target's offensive capability, skills and spellcasting ability. Assuming the subject survived, he regained lost power after a number of hours.

If the ray struck an [[undead]] creature, it temporarily increased the creature's un-lifeforce.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Stoca]] in {{Yearlink|-1790}} and was originally called ''Stoca's feign''.
