        "mainbody": "'''''Edge of Arumdina''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to priests of [[Garl Glittergold]], the Watchful Protector of the [[gnome]]s. It gave an edged weapon the ability to pass through metal, stone, or earth as if they were air.",
        "Effects": "The caster had to touch an edged weapon to cast ''edge of Arumdina'' upon it. The spell lasted for at least two minutes (longer for more experienced casters) and allowed the entire weapon (blade, handle, pommel, ''etc.'') to pass through metal, stone, or earth as if they weren't there. Stone walls or metal armor provided no protection from a weapon with this enchantment. However, ''edge of Arumdina'' did not turn a non-magical weapon into a magical one for the purpose of harming creatures immune to non-magical weapons.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.",
        "History": "''[[Arumdina]]'' was Garl Glittergold's sentient [[battleaxe]] and this spell was named after one of its magical abilities."
