Taunt (originally called Daces taunting
When taunt was cast, the affected creature became hostile and would attempt to attack the caster.
When used in conjunction with a ventriloquism spell, the creatures might attack the apparent source, depending upon their intelligence, a leaders presence, and so on.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material component was a slug, which was hurled at the creatures.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Dace, in âˆ’1839 DR, originally called Daces taunting.
