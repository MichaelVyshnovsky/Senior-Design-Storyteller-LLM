'''Pirtelspace''' was a [[crystal sphere]] in the [[Arcane Inner Flow]].{{Cite dungeon/36/The Sea of Sorrow|44-45}}

==Location==
Pirtelspace was located halfway between [[Refugespace]] and [[Darnannonspace]] in the Arcane Inner Flow. The [[phlogiston|flow]] currents in the region allowed for two-way travel to both neighboring spheres.

==The Solar System==
The sphere of Pirtelspace was relatively cold, with temperatures in the outer regions dropping below freezing. There were two worlds, an asteroid belt, and an asteroid shell orbiting the single cool red star that lit the sphere.

* '''Century''' was the outermost feature of the sphere, a frozen minor world that took 100 years to orbit the sun. It was a tidally locked planet inhabited by [[human]] barbarian tribes on the sunward side and [[drow]] on the dark side; in the Lands of Grey Ice that formed the boundary between the two there was an ongoing war between the humans and drow.{{Cite dungeon/36/The Sea of Sorrow|47-48}}
**'''Darkwatch''' was an elven military base established to keep a watch over the stranded drow, built on a small asteroid that orbited Century. It was inhabited by several hundred elves before the depredations of Blacklight caused it to fall into ruins.
*'''Guinmir's Band''' was a sparse asteroid belt between Century and Archin containing rocks {{SIrange|10|500|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. It was supposedly the remains of a planet called Guinmir, although some sages discounted that theory of asteroid belt formation.
*'''Archin''' was a water world some {{SI|7000|mi|long=yes}} in diameter, inhabited by [[halfling]]s, three separate human civilizations, and [[sea elves]].
**[[Skyport]] was a space port built by Antonius Pirtel, a grey disk of stone some {{SI|500|yd|long=yes}} in diameter orbiting Archin perpendicular to the surface, with a featureless, circular tower rising {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}} from the center of the disk.
*The '''Mor Wake''' was a thick sphere of asteroids surrounding the sun, inhabited by various wildspace critters including [[night scavver]]s.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/36/The Sea of Sorrow|54}}
**The '''Sea of Sorrow''' was a deadly sargasso that moved unpredictably around the Mor Wake,<ref>{{Cite dungeon/36/The Sea of Sorrow|56}} created when the Ice Mage Pirtel fought a pair of twin [[lich]]es, using a ''[[sphere of annihilation]]'' to destroy one before the other twin opened a [[gate]], and the collision of the sphere and gate catapulted the mages onto different planes, and created the Lich's Tear that was the heart and source of the sargasso.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/36/The Sea of Sorrow|64}}

==History==
Pirtelspace was originally discovered by Antonius Pirtel, who also built the Skydock.He built Skydock some five centuries before the adventures' events.

At some point during the [[First Unhuman War]], the [[Elven Imperial Fleet]] fought a large battle with a [[drow]] fleet that ended in elven victory when the drow crashed their fleet onto Century rather than surrender.

At one point, a group of spelljamming drow tried to use a stolen ''[[talisman of the spheres]]'' to transport their fleet from [[Realmspace]] to a new base in Pirtelspace.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/45/An Artist's Errand|12}}
