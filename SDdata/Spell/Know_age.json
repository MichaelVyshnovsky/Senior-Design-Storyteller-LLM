The spell was accurate to within one year of the actual age.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a page from a calendar.\nKnow age was one of the spells contained within the Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the faith of Mystra. It was also found in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy spellbook of the Church of Mielikki."
