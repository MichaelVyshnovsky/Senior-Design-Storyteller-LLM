        "mainbody": "'''''Acid splash''''', also known as '''''acid orb''''', was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effect": "After the  [[Second Sundering]], when ''acid splash'' was cast, the sorcerer or wizard conjured a sphere of liquid acid which, when thrust at a target, collided and exploded, burning one creature with its contents. The spell was easily cast and one needed not rest before recasting it. The potency of the spell's effects also increased over time, dependent both on the sorcerer's level of experience as well as, as in the case of most sorcerer spells, the sorcerer's strength of personality.\n\nLike other spells, ''acid splash'' could only be cast as many times as its caster either had energy left for spellcasting or, in the case of wizards, had prepared for it.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
