        "mainbody": "Jumpgout was an evocation spell that created a massive pillar of flame that jumped from one location to another, either at the direction of the caster or by random chance.\nWhen this spell was cast, the soaring fire engulfed an area  in diameter and  high. Any person or creature caught within the inferno was horribly burned. A few moments later, the fires vanished for a second, then reappeared in an area within  of the original location.\nIf the caster concentrated on directing the flames, they could choose were the reappearance occurred otherwise, it was completely random. Following the second conflagration, the jumpgout vanished in a swirl of cinders.\nThis spell only required verbal components to cast.\nSince at least the , the bronze dragon Nymmurh passed knowledge of jumpgout down to various members of the Silmerhelve family over the generations. And at some point during the 14 century DR, Volothamp Geddarm managed to learn of the spell."
