        "mainbody": "'''''Jumpgout''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a massive pillar of flame that jumped from one location to another, either at the direction of the caster or by random chance.",
        "Effects": "When this spell was cast, the soaring fire engulfed an area {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in diameter and {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} high. Any person or creature caught within the inferno was horribly burned. A few moments later, the fires vanished for a second, then reappeared in an area within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of the original location.\n\nIf the caster concentrated on directing the flames, they could choose were the reappearance occurred; otherwise, it was completely random. Following the second conflagration, the ''jumpgout'' vanished in a swirl of cinders.",
        "Components": "This spell only required [[verbal component]]s to cast.",
        "History": "Since at least the {{YearlinkName|1032}}, the [[bronze dragon]] [[Nymmurh]] passed knowledge of ''jumpgout'' down to various members of the [[Silmerhelve]] family over the generations. And at some point during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Volothamp Geddarm]] managed to learn of the spell."
