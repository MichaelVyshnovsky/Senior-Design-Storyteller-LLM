        "mainbody": "'''''Tangle''''' was a reversed [[cantrip]] that acolyte [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It was similar to the ''[[tie]]'' cantrip but only operated on finely stranded objects and could snarl dissimilar materials.",
        "Effects": "The target of this spell had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster. This cantrip only operated on thin strands of material such as [[grass]], hair, loose string, loose thread, or the frayed end of a [[rope]], but nothing as thick or heavy as a normal rope. It caused the material to become intertwined with itself or with a similar material in close proximity. The resulting snarl took several minutes to untangle without cutting, snapping, or tearing the threads.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster twirled their finger as if stirring something while making a buzzing sound."
