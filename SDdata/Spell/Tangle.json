        "mainbody": "Tangle was a reversed cantrip that acolyte wizards could learn. It was similar to the tie cantrip but only operated on finely stranded objects and could snarl dissimilar materials.\nThe target of this spell had to be within  of the caster. This cantrip only operated on thin strands of material such as grass, hair, loose string, loose thread, or the frayed end of a rope, but nothing as thick or heavy as a normal rope. It caused the material to become intertwined with itself or with a similar material in close proximity. The resulting snarl took several minutes to untangle without cutting, snapping, or tearing the threads.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster twirled their finger as if stirring something while making a buzzing sound."
