        "mainbody": "'''''Darsson's chilling chamber''''' was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] that lowered the temperature of an area to extremely cold levels for hours at a time. It would damage any creatures vulnerable to cold and chill anyone in metal armor similar to the ''[[chill metal]]'' spell. These effects could be made permanent via the casting of ''[[permanency]]''.",
        "Development": "This spell was originally made to preserve food in cellars, but creative [[wizard]]s adapted its use as a defensive deterrent or creating a more habitable environment their cold-loving pets and [[familiar]]s."
