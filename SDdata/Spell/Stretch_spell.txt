'''''Stretch spell''''' was a [[spell]] used by many [[sorcerer]]s early in their training. ''Stretch spell'' allowed sorcerers to bend the fabric of space to extend the reach of their spells, for a moment, by a number of feet dependent upon their natural agility and reflexes. ''Stretch spell'' was somewhat easy to cast, taking only an instant to use, and could be cast again after a rest of a few minutes.
