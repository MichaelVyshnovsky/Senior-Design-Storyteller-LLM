        "mainbody": "'''''Ancestral spirit''''' was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] similar to ''[[augury]]'', used by [[witch doctor]]s of the [[Malatran Plateau]] through ''[[spell fetish]]es'' rather than ''[[spellbook]]s''.{{Cite polyhedron/125/Living Jungle Spells|20-21}}",
        "Effects": "The spell allowed arcane spellcasters from the [[Malatran Plateau]] to contact an ''ancestral spirit'' for aid or advice. Methods of casting varied among the tribes and sentient species of the [[Living Jungle]]. In order to cast the spell, the witch doctor had to tell stories of the ancestor they attempted to contact, calling tales of the progenitor's deeds to an audience of at least three individuals of the same species as the caster. Some Malatran tribes performed animated presentations by a campfire, while others orated by pools of clear water. The ''ancestral spirit's'' spell successes depended on the caster's abilities to tell tales and oratory skills.\n\nIf the summoned spirit was impressed by the tales, they took a form of a small animal size of a [[rabbit]] and followed the spellcaster for one tenday. The mere presence of the spirit in an animal shape affected heroic deeds performed by the spellcaster in a beneficial way. Additionally, the caster could pose a question to the ''ancestral spirit'', but unlike the ''augury'' spell, the spirit was free to answer the question as they deemed, not restricted to \"yes\" or \"no\" answers. These answers tended to be short and cryptic.",
        "Components": "The spell called for verbal, somatic, and material components. The material component was an item of significance to the spirit being summoned. The memento could sustain five spell castings before being consumed. Such items varied depending on the tribe, usually pieces of clothing, carved figurines, jewelry, carved bone, etc."
