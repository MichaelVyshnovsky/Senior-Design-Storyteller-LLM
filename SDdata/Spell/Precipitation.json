        "mainbody": "'''''Precipitation''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Istishia]], enabling them to create a light rainfall.",
        "Effects": "This spell caused a light rain to fall from the sky. The rainfall was enough to extinguish small flames from candles but would only make small fires smoke and had no effect on larger fires. Flame-based magic cast through the rainfall would cause slightly less physical harm than normal, but created a warm fog that obscured vision. The rainfall doubled the normal humidity for a given area.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast."
