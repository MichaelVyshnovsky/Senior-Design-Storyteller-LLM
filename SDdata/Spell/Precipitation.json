        "mainbody": "Precipitation was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Istishia, enabling them to create a light rainfall.\nThis spell caused a light rain to fall from the sky. The rainfall was enough to extinguish small flames from candles but would only make small fires smoke and had no effect on larger fires. Flame-based magic cast through the rainfall would cause slightly less physical harm than normal, but created a warm fog that obscured vision. The rainfall doubled the normal humidity for a given area.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the priests holy symbol to cast."
