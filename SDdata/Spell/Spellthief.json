        "mainbody": "A spellthief was an individual trained in stealth and practiced in stealing the magical powers of others.\nThough spellthieves were much like rogues at heart, they possessed the unique power to steal spells from those they snuck with progress, they were able to progressively steal more and more complex spells. Developing this power made their abilities slightly different from those of other sneaks they developed the ability to cast detect magic on their own and had an inexplicable aptitude for thwarting the worst of any spells effect.\nSpellthieves soon learned to steal ongoing spell effects from others, and then commit ever stranger thefts they were known to steal resistance against some kinds of energy and, as their talents progressed in the power of the spells they could steal, they also gained the ability to steal the spells of magical creatures, not only those of wizards and others. A spellthief progressing in talent could also steal a spell for their own use instead of being affected by it. Advanced spellthieves developed an ability akin to arcane sight, which they could use at least once per day, or as often as their sense of self was able to power it. They also gained a very limited selection of arcane spells of their own, limited only to those of lesser or middling power, and never from necromancy, evocation, or conjuration.\nEven more powerful spellthieves could instantly discover all of a mages prepared spells simply by stealing one spell those nearing the pinnacle of the paths possibilities were also able to snatch away their foes spell resistance when attacking by surprise.\nAfter the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, mortals who came into contact with gods blood were changed by the ichor some of them became spellthieves, though the changes sometimes took a generation or so to take effect. The spellthieves whose power came from godsblood were sometimes linked intrinsically to these powers, and had a strange ability to cast divine magic from these gods domains with stolen spell power.\nOther mortals gained spellthieving powers from wild magic exposure, or tainted water such as from the Winding Water.\n* Anwhar Bellgate\n* Erilon Amadar"
