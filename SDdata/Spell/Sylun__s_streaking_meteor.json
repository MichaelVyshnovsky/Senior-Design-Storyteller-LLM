        "mainbody": "Sylunés streaking meteor was a wizard spell from the school of alteration. This spell was created by Syluné Silverhand.\nThis spell created a ball of flame  in diameter. The caster picked the starting point for the meteor and it raced forward where the caster pointed, spreading out in a teardrop shape reaching  across at the widest point.\nAfter travelling  in the initial direction, the meteor would make a ninety degree turn in a direction determined by the caster to travel another  before fading away. This spell was incredibly useful for striking at targets around corners or other barriers.\nThe meteor would rebound straight back on its own path if it struck a solid barrier or a large creature. The meteor would complete the remainder of its journey before expiring. The meteor could rebound many times but lost intensity with each rebound. The starting intensity of the meteors flames was determined by the skill of the caster.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components an insect wing or bird feather, a pinch of ash from a fire, and a pinch of sulfur or saltpeter to cast."
