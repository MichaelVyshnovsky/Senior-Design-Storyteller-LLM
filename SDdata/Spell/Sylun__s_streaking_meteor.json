        "Effects": "This spell created a ball of flame {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. The caster picked the starting point for the meteor and it raced forward where the caster pointed, spreading out in a teardrop shape reaching {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} across at the widest point.\n\nAfter travelling {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} in the initial direction, the meteor would make a ninety degree turn in a direction determined by the caster to travel another {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} before fading away. This spell was incredibly useful for striking at targets around corners or other barriers.\n\nThe meteor would rebound straight back on its own path if it struck a solid barrier or a large creature. The meteor would complete the remainder of its journey before expiring. The meteor could rebound many times but lost intensity with each rebound. The starting intensity of the meteor's flames was determined by the skill of the caster.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s an insect wing or bird feather, a pinch of ash from a fire, and a pinch of sulfur or saltpeter to cast."
