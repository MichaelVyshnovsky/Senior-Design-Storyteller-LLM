        "mainbody": "'''''Finger of death''''' was a [[spell]] where the caster would attempt to cause instant death to a target.",
        "Effects": "The oldest version of the spell would just attempt to kill the target. The caster would incant the spell while pointing their finger at the target.\n\nA later version would also seek to destroy a person's life force, but it had the ability to also raise a human killed with the spell and, with an expensive ceremony, turn them into a [[ju-ju zombie]] under the caster's command. The victim could not be resurrected or raised from the dead in any other way. Only a ''[[limited wish]]'' could end this effect, or a ''[[wish]]'' that would fully resurrect the target.\n\nA newer version would again attempt to try and kill the target outright, unless the target managed to resist it, in which case they would take damage instead.\n\nThe post [[Second Sundering]] version would attempt to cause a catastrophic amount of damage and if a target died they would after a few seconds be raised as a [[zombie]], under the caster's command.",
        "Components": "Only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components were required to cast this spell. Early druids also needed their [[holy symbol]].",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Dethed]] in {{Yearlink|-1864}}, originally called ''Dethed's death finger''."
