        "mainbody": "Slay living was a necromancy spell that could kill a single creature. The older versions of this spell were also reversible, known as raise dead.\nThe target had to be a living creature for this spell to be effective. The newer version of slay living required a successful melee touch attack in order to cast, but the older versions operated at a range of 90 ft (27.4 m). In this respect, they were very similar to finger of death.\nIf the target was able to overcome the death magic, they were not killed outright but were then subject to damage on the order of an inflict serious wounds spell, which still might have been fatal.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. The somatic component for the older versions was to point at the intended victim."
