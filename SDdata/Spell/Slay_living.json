        "mainbody": "'''''Slay living''''' was a [[necromancy]] spell that could kill a single creature. The older versions of this spell were also reversible, known as ''[[raise dead]]''.",
        "Effects": "The target had to be a living creature for this spell to be effective. The newer version of ''slay living'' required a successful melee touch attack in order to cast, but the older versions operated at a range of 90 ft (27.4 m). In this respect, they were very similar to ''[[finger of death]]''.\n\nIf the target was able to overcome the [[death magic]], they were not killed outright but were then subject to damage on the order of an ''[[inflict serious wounds]]'' spell, which still might have been fatal.",
        "Components": "Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. The somatic component for the older versions was to point at the intended victim."
