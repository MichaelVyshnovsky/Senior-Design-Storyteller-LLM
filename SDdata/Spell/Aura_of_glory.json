        "mainbody": "Aura of glory was a spell used by paladins.\nWhen cast, this spell allowed a caster increase their magical abilities and physical presence. The spell achieved this by channelling divine energy into the caster. Allies of the caster within  were healed, the equivalent of a cure minor wounds spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a divine focus."
