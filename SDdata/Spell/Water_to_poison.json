        "mainbody": "'''''Water to poison''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the wu jen was able to transform any consumable liquid into a poison. The strength of the poison was determined by the wu jen's skill level. A single swallow was enough to poison a creature. The poison could be detected by a creature with a keen sense of smell. \n\n''[[Poison to water]]'' was the reverse of the spell. It allowed a wu jen to transform liquid containing poison into water safe for consumption. It was able to transform pure venom as well. The spell had no effect on a creature with venomous glands, or a creature who was already poisoned.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s, a fang of a venomous snake, and a [[bloodstone]] valued at least 50 [[gp]]."
