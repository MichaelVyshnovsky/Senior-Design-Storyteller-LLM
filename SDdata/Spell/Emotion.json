        "Effects": {
            "Rage/Courage (arcane, divine, illusionist)": "Affected creatures lost all fear, dropped their shields, and waded into battle with a berserk fury, completely disregarding danger to themselves. They were granted a small amount of additional health to help them survive and their boosted strength and morale made them more effective fighters. ''Emotion (rage)'' countered and was countered by ''emotion (fear)''.\n[[File:Emotion fear.png|thumb|''The spell symbol for emotion: fear spell.'']]",
            "Fear (arcane, divine, illusionist)": "Affected creatures were overwhelmed with fear, typically dropped whatever they carried, and moved away from the caster in panic as quickly as possible, even beyond the range of this spell. If the spell wore off or was countered, and a creature attempted to approach the caster again while this spell was in effect, they had to again try to resist the ''fear'' when they reentered the area. ''Emotion (fear)'' countered and was countered by ''emotion (rage)''.",
            "Friendship (arcane, divine only)": "The demeanor with which affected creatures regarded the caster was improved. For example, a merely tolerant individual was moved to show goodwill, or a threatening creature became just cautious. ''Emotion (friendship)'' countered and was countered by ''emotion (hate)''.",
            "Happiness (arcane, divine only)": "Creatures became confident, content, complacent, and generally felt good about their current situation. Their reactions were more positive and they were unlikely to take any action against the caster unless sufficiently provoked. ''Emotion (happiness)'' countered and was countered by ''emotion (sadness)''.",
            "Hate (arcane, divine, illusionist)": "Affected creatures regarded the caster in a more negative manner. For example, friendly creatures became indifferent, or cautious creatures became threatening. For arcane and divine casters, ''emotion (hate)'' countered and was countered by ''emotion (friendship)'', but for illusionists it countered and was countered by ''emotion (hopelessness)''.\n[[File:Emotion hope.png|thumb|''The spell symbol for emotion: hope spell.'']]",
            "Hope (arcane, divine only)": "Affected creatures gained a significant morale boost, making them more effective in combat and better able to resist all non-melee attacks such as spells, [[dragon breath]], [[poison]], ''etc.'' ''Emotion (hope)'' countered and was countered by ''emotion (hopelessness)''.\n[[File:Emotion- Despair.png|thumb|''The spell symbol for emotion: despair spell.'']]",
            "Hopelessness (arcane, divine, illusionist)": "Affected creatures suffered a significant drop in morale and were likely to surrender or otherwise submit to the bidding of any opponent, retreat from conflict, or listlessly stand and do nothing. For arcane and divine casters, ''emotion (hopelessness)'' countered and was countered by ''emotion (hope)'', but for illusionists it countered and was countered by ''emotion (hate)''.",
            "Sadness (arcane, divine only)": "Affected creatures became morose and self-absorbed with their own misfortune. This reduced their alertness, made them slow to react, and took the heart out of their will to fight. ''Emotion (sadness)'' countered and was countered by ''emotion (happiness)''.\n\nWhen divine spellcasters used ''emotion control'' on themselves, it afforded them increased protection from spells such as ''emotion'' (the arcane version of this spell), ''[[fear]]'', ''[[irritation]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[phantasmal killer]]'', ''[[scare]]'', ''[[spook]]'', and ''[[taunt]]''. Furthermore, the priest was instantly aware that he or she was the target of such a spell. If a protected priest was the subject of ''[[ESP]]'' or ''[[emotion read]]'', he or she had a much improved chance to project a false emotion (chosen at the time of casting this spell)."

        "Components": "The arcane versions of this spell (including illusionist) required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast. The divine version also required some uncarded [[wool]] or a lock of [[fleece]] as a [[material component]].",
        "History": "The arcane version of this spell was invented by a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Keonid]] in the year [[-1883 DR|1976 NR (âˆ’1883 DR)]] and was part of the [[Mentalism]] specialization school of magic. Clerics and [[druid]]s had access to the divine ''emotion control'' version."
