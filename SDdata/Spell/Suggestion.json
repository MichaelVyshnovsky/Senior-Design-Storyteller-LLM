        "mainbody": "Suggestion was an enchantment spell used to compel a subject to follow the casters orders, but only if they could understand the casters spoken language.\nWith this spell the caster influenced the subject through verbal suggestions. In order to work properly, the suggestion needed to be worded so the subject believed the suggestion was reasonable. For example, the spell would probably fail if the caster asked a fire elemental to dive into a body of water. However, if the caster could convince the fire elemental that the water was harmless, then the spell had a greater chance of succeeding.\nThe caster could issue new suggestions for the duration of the spell. However, the spell ended when the subject completed any suggestion. The suggestion went unfulfilled if the spell ended and the subject had not completed their task.\nThis spell required a snakes tongue and either a small piece of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil to cast.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Keonid in  and was originally called Keonids suggestion.\nFittingly, the hypnos magen of ancient Netheril were capable of casting a version of this spell with their psychic powers, without the need of a material component."
