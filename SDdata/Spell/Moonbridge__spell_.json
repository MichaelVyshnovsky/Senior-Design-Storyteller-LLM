        "mainbody": "Moonbridge was a spell used by clerics of Sehanine Moonbow.\nWhen cast, this spell transformed a beam of moonlight into a bridge that was capable of supporting the weight of several creatures. The resulting bridge was  in width and up to  in length. The moonlight could be natural or created by magical means such as with a motes of moonlight spell. Only creatures of good-alignment can cross the bridge freely. Creatures of neutral alignment could only cross if they maintained physical contact with the caster. Creatures of evil alignment were unable to cross the bridge.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Sehanine Moonbow and a single vial of holy water that sat in the direct moonlight of the previous full moon."
