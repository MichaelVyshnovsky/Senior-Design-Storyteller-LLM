        "mainbody": "'''''Moonbridge''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Sehanine Moonbow]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell transformed a beam of moonlight into a bridge that was capable of supporting the weight of several creatures. The resulting bridge was {{SI|3|ft|c|long=yes}} in width and up to {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} in length. The moonlight could be natural or created by magical means such as with a ''[[motes of moonlight]]'' spell. Only creatures of [[Good|good-alignment]] can cross the bridge freely. Creatures of [[neutral|neutral alignment]] could only cross if they maintained physical contact with the caster. Creatures of [[Evil|evil alignment]] were unable to cross the bridge.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Sehanine Moonbow and a single vial of [[holy water]] that sat in the direct moonlight of the previous full moon."
