        "mainbody": "'''''Ice blade''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell given to [[specialty priest]]s of [[Auril]], the Frostmaiden. It produced whirling formation of ice crystals in the shape of a sword that the caster could wield with great skill.",
        "Effects": "When cast, a four-foot (1.2 meters) force blade, 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide, made up of swirling ice shards grew out of the caster's hand to form a sword-like shape. It weighed nothing to the caster and was considered a ''+2'' magical weapon. The flying shards moved around obstacles, like small [[shield]]s, parrying weapons, or trees, giving the wielder an exceptionally high chance to hit any creature that it passed through. On a successful attack, it lacerated the target like a blizzard of sharp ice and did additional damage from magical cold. A sweeping maneuver could attack more than one creature in range of the ''blade'' with no combat penalties.\n\nThe ''ice blade'' lasted long enough to make seven consecutive attacks or actions (higher level casters could extend the duration) and then faded away.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] small shard of ice, glass, or [[rock crystal|crystal]] to cast."
