        "mainbody": "'''''Skeletal bride''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the school of [[necromancy]].",
        "Effects": "This spell created a [[skeleton|skeletal]] form that was the same height and size as the caster. The head was flesh-colored with hair of any length the caster desired, but the face was featureless. The ''skeletal bride'' was not a form of [[undead]] so was immune to any magical attacks designed to specifically harm undead.\n\nThe caster could move the bride about with their mind but the bride would collapse into a pile of dust if moved beyond the range of the spell. This spell was effective if used as a decoy to spring an ambush designed for the caster. The bride could not speak, but spells such as ''[[ventriloquism]]'' could be used on them to make it appear as if they could.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]] a [[human]] bone to cast."
