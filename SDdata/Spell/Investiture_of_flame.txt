Investiture of flame was a transmutation spell that wreathed the caster in swirling protective flames that could also be used as a form of attack.
The spell created bright flames that ran harmlessly around the casters body and lasted for up to 10 minutes, as long as the caster kept concentrating. The flames rendered the caster immune to all forms of fire and conferred magical resistance to cold. They also burned any creature that came too close, and could shoot out at the casters command as bolts that reached as far as  and burned all creatures along their paths.
The spell only required verbal and somatic components.
