'''''Push''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that caused an invisible force to strike a target.

==Effects==
After uttering specific syllables, the ''push'' spell sent a small wave of invisible force at a target which usually generated enough force to push the target as if they had been pushed by another person. This spell could be used against inanimate objects held by others as well to tear the item from their grasp.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a pinch of powdered [[brass]] which was blown from the palm while pointing at the target.

==History==
This spell was found within the tome ''[[Detho's Libram]]''.
