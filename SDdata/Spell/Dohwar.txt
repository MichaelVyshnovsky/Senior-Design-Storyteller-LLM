The '''dohwar''', sometimes called '''dowhar''',{{Cite dragon/339/Races of Spelljammer|27}} were a race of short, flightless avians. A merchant race, they considered themselves the great rivals of the [[Arcane (race)|Arcane]], although the Arcane themselves barely acknowledged their existence.

==Description==
Dohwar distantly resembled [[penguin]]s, standing {{SIrange|3|4|ft}} on average. Their chests were covered in white feathers, while the rest of their bodies were covered in bright colorful plumage that varied in color, including black. They had wings that, although not useful for flight, were capable of grabbing objects. Much like penguins, they walked by waddling ungracefully, which was considered by [[elves]] an insult to the very idea of elegant movement.

The dohwar dressed equally ungracefully, mixing clashing and extremely bright and showy clothes, also to the dismay of elves and other races. However, when on a planet whose population was not accustomed to their appearance, dohwar would adopt a more inconspicuous outlook, covering themselves in hoods and [[cloak]]s in order to appear nothing more than short people.

==Personality==
Insistent merchants, dohwar intentionally lacked any social skills. When negotiating, they frequently engaged in pushy and unpleasant behavior, pairing up against a potential customer and endlessly reciting their list of merchandise or offers to buy their client's possessions until some sort of deal was struck. They carried incredibly varied selections of goods, including wagons, small boats, [[magic item]]s, and any other items imaginable.

While seemingly chaotic and disorganized when seen by outsiders, dohwar were very well organized and worked well together for the good of their species. They were constantly under the impression that everyone else in the [[multiverse]] was actively working against them, a feeling that most of the time inspired solidarity among their own.

==Abilities==
All dohwar were innately capable of communicating [[telepathy|telepathically]] with each other. They also used their telepathic skills to read other creatures' minds, Although usage of this power was mentally taxing for them, two mated dohwar entered a state of pairing known as a "merger", during which their lifelong connection allowed them to finish each other's sentences. This behavior was considered extremely unnerving to other races.

==Combat==
It was uncommon for dohwar themselves to get involved in fights. Their only natural weapons were their fangs, which had evolved to eat tough vegetation on several planets across [[wildspace]]. They usually hired mercenaries, typically [[giff]], to fight in their stead.

However, if in a situation in which mercenaries could not be trusted or relied upon, some dohwar did specialize in combat. Known as '''Protectors''', each of these fighting dohwar was armed with a [[weega]], a type of sword blade that was worn on their beaks, which turned an otherwise harmless peck into a deadly weapon. Protectors also favored heavy [[armor]].

Some groups of dohwar Protectors were capable of riding [[space swine]] and organized air strike groups known as Deathsquealers, typically composed of squads of four Protectors each. These riders wielded [[lance]]s in addition to their weega and were proficient with numerous air fighting techniques.

==Society==
Dohwar society was organized in large groups known as "cartels", which ranged from over 100 to around 230 individuals, including adults and children. Each cartel was led by a powerful [[spellcaster]] known as a '''President'''. Other spellcasters down the hierarchy were known as '''Executive Board members''' and '''Managers'''. The latter usually piloted the dohwar [[spelljammer]]s. Due to the dohwar's strong aversion to pain, many spellcasters specialized in healing magic.

The favored ships used by the dohwar were known as [[uspo]]s, huge spelljammers shaped like penguins lying on their stomachs. They were typically employed as merchant ships and were loaded with trade goods. Although uspos did not carry any armament, they were frequently crewed by well armed security squads of Deathsquealers and [[giff]] mercenaries.
===Diet===
The dohwar diet included [[fish]], [[plankton]], and vegetables. They were immune to the effects of [[:category:alcohol|alcoholic beverage]]s, but were highly susceptible to being intoxicated by sweet food, which produced on them an effect similar to drunkenness. A single [[apple]], for example, could produce the effects of a strong [[ale]], while small amounts of [[honey]] or [[maple syrup]] could drive a dohwar completely drunk.
===Homelands===
While being able to live in any environment, dohwar tended to prefer arctic and sub-arctic climates, near large [[:Category:Bodies of water|bodies of water]]. Their relation with the environment was one of balance and non-disturbance. They were monogamous and mated for life, and reproduced by laying a few eggs once a year. The eggs were referred to as "new wares".

The homeworld of the dohwar was said to be an arctic planet populated by millions of individuals engaged in several business practices. Its location was unknown and not actively searched for by any race.
===Religions===
Dohwar religion was centered around [[deities]] associated with commerce, wealth, and profit. They were known for worshiping deities of various alignments and from diverse origins, in hopes of not alienating or offending any commerce deity and in the belief that such a diverse pantheon would lead them to becoming the best merchants in the multiverse. Among this pantheon of commerce deities were notably the [[Morndinsamman|Dwarven god]] [[Abbathor]] and the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian goddess]] [[Waukeen]]. Religious donations offered by dohwar were seen as investments in their future relations with their deities.
===Relationships===
Dohwar were almost universally shunned by other races and considered a major irritant. They were deemed intolerable by elves and [[reigar]], and were largely ignored by the [[Arcane (race)|Arcane]]. [[Mind flayer]]s and [[beholder]]s considered them only of interest for their biological experiments, while the [[neogi]] appreciated the taste of dohwar flesh and [[Gith (race)|gith]] pirates sought them for the loot in their ships. The only race that maintained friendly relations with the dohwar were [[gnome]]s, who had an enormous interest in the gadgets they sold in order to incorporate them into their inventions. The dohwar themselves were also known for reselling many gnomish inventions.

==History==
In the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]], a small group of dohwar from [[Realmspace]] traveled to [[Clusterspace]] in pursuit of a [[neogi]] trading vessel in retaliation for a failed attempt by the neogi to capture the dohwar ship. Upon arrival in the Astromundi Cluster, the dohwar started forming alliances and attempting to establish a trade organization within the sphere.

==Notable Dohwar==
In the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]], a dohwar merchant sold wares in the [[Greater Market]] in [[Bral]]. Another dohwar worked as a serving wench on one of the asteroids of [[Garden]].
