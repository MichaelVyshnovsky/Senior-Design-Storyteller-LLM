Circle of bones was a divine spell that caused floating bones to circle around the caster.
Only non good-aligned mages could cast circle of bones. Once the spell was cast cast, the floating bone circle spun quickly, hitting any who stepped within a  radius of the caster. Those who were hit were subject to both slashing and crushing by the bones. However, once active, the caster was unable to move.
