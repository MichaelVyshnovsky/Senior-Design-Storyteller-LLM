'''''Circle of bones''''' was a [[divine]] [[spell]] that caused floating bones to circle around the caster.

==Effects==
Only non [[good]]-aligned [[mage]]s could cast ''circle of bones''. Once the spell was cast cast, the floating bone circle spun quickly, hitting any who stepped within a {{SI|3|ft}} radius of the caster. Those who were hit were subject to both slashing and crushing by the bones. However, once active, the caster was unable to move.
