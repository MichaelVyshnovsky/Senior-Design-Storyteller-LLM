        "Effects": "The divine spell allowed the spoken word of the caster to be magically inscribed onto a writing surface, such as paper, papyrus and vellum. The caster had to be within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the writing surface while speaking.\n\nThe arcane spell gave the caster the ability to copy any writing, including glyphs, runes and written spell, onto a writing surface. The spell functioned even if the caster could not read what was to be duplicated. The spell made a perfect copy, so any imperfections in the original were copied over. The spell did not require the caster's focus once cast.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[Verbal component|verbal]] components, the divine spell required [[material component]]s, papyrus, a feather from a [[hawk]] and the [[ink]] from a [[squid]], while the arcane spell required a feathered quill. The quill had to remain within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the original and the caster had to remain within {{SI|70|ft|long=yes}} of the quill."
