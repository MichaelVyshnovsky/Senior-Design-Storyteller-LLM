        "mainbody": "Inscribe was the name of a southern magic divine spell available to worshipers of Thoth, and an arcane spell used by wizards.\nThe divine spell allowed the spoken word of the caster to be magically inscribed onto a writing surface, such as paper, papyrus and vellum. The caster had to be within  of the writing surface while speaking.\nThe arcane spell gave the caster the ability to copy any writing, including glyphs, runes and written spell, onto a writing surface. The spell functioned even if the caster could not read what was to be duplicated. The spell made a perfect copy, so any imperfections in the original were copied over. The spell did not require the casters focus once cast.\nIn addition to somatic and verbal components, the divine spell required material components, papyrus, a feather from a hawk and the ink from a squid, while the arcane spell required a feathered quill. The quill had to remain within  of the original and the caster had to remain within  of the quill."
