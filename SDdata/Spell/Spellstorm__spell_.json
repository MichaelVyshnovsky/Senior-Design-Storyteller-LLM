        "mainbody": "Spellstorm was a wizard spell from the school of alteration.\nThis spell created a sphere centered on the caster that moved around with them. It caused every weapon within a  diameter to spring forward and attack a target of the casters choosing. The caster did not need to know the locations of each weapon, nor could any physical barriers, such as chests, keep the weapons from becoming involved in the spell. There was no limit to the number of weapons that would be affected by this spell as long as they were within range.\nAdditionally, no mundane weapons, including those launched from outside of the spells affected area, could harm the caster while the spell remained active.\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast."
