        "Usage": "This spell created a sphere centered on the caster that moved around with them. It caused every weapon within a {{SI|70|ft|long=yes}} diameter to spring forward and attack a target of the caster's choosing. The caster did not need to know the locations of each weapon, nor could any physical barriers, such as chests, keep the weapons from becoming involved in the spell. There was no limit to the number of weapons that would be affected by this spell as long as they were within range.\n\nAdditionally, no mundane weapons, including those launched from outside of the spell's affected area, could harm the caster while the spell remained active.",
        "Components": "This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast."
