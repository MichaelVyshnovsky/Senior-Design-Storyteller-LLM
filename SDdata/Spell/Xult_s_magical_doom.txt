Xults magical doom was an arcane alteration spell that sealed an item against unwanted perusal.
This spell would seal an item against unwanted intrusion or perusal. The item to be sealed was traced with runes by the casters fingertip during casting. Only the caster, anyone named by the caster during the casting, or anyone speaking the special word of deactivation specified by the caster could use the item without triggering the runes. The runes could be removed with a successful dispel magic spell.
If triggered, the runes would release the magical doom that affected all creatures within  of the item. The magical doom permanently polymorphed affected creatures into a bat, frog, snake, or toad. Polymorphed creatures possessed the same intelligence they had in their previous form, assuming their transformation did not drive them insane, so they could possibly communicate their plight to others or even use a magic item to restore their form.
The magical doom placed upon an item would last until triggered. The skill of the caster determined how many times their magical doom could be triggered before expiring and needing to be recast.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a pinch of dust and a caterpillars cocoon to cast.
Cassana, a wicked member of the Fire Knives, was fond of Xults magical doom.
