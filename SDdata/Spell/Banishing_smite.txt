Banishing smite was an abjuration spell for paladins that made a weapon crackle with power and cause more damage.
The spell caused the chosen weapon to crackle with power and cause serious damage. A struck target with less than certain level of vitality would be banished. A creature from another plane was sent to its native plane, while a creature on its home plane was sent to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target was incapacitated and when the spell ended the creature was sent back to their original location.
The spell had only a verbal component.
