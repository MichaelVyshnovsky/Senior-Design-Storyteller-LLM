'''''Find traps''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to detect [[trap]]s.

==Effect==
The oldest version of this spell functioned across an area and revealed all traps in a specific area around the caster. A newer version allowed the caster to search for traps like a rogue might within {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} or more, depending on skill, but it would not make the caster any better at finding them.

The post [[Second Sundering]] version functioned by letting the caster know that a trap such as ''[[glyph of warding]]'' or ''[[alarm]]'' was within his or her line of sight out to a range of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}.
