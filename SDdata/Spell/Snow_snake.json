If this snow was produced by the spells ice storm or cone of cold, it enhanced the capabilities of the snow snake.\nWhen cast, the snow snake appeared and struck at any beings that were hostile to the cleric. It came crashing down in a massive dome-shaped blast.\nThe snow snake could be briefly ridden by the caster, but only for a short distance.\nThis was spell was contained within the Aurilian relic, the Silver Supplicant.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a number of material components, including a mass of snow twice the size of the caster and a single teardrop, drop of water or spit."
