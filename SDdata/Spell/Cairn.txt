'''''Cairn''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] spell that created a pile of rocks.

==Effect==
The spell gathered rocks and stones from all around (not including any organic or other materials) and dropped them on a given location from a height of 20 feet (6 meters). This created a rough pile some 5 feet (1.5 meters) and 15 feet (4.5 meters) high.

==Uses==
The ''cairn'' spell had a number of common uses, typically to form a grave, but also to mark a specific location, to bury or hide a buried stash or store, or whatever else one might use a pile of rocks for. More dangerously, it could be used to crush a victim under the falling rocks, and even bury them.

==Components==
The spell required at least eight pebbles that could all fit in the caster's hand. The actual stones used in the ''cairn'' were lifted from random locations in the vicinity.

==History==
The ''cairn'' spell appeared within the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', the holiest book of the [[church of Ilmater]], which first appeared in the Realms in [[848 DR]].

In [[1341 DR]], the rogue priest of [[Ilmater]], Brother [[Bloirt Waelarn]] used a ''cairn'' spell from the ''Tome'' to bury Sir [[Guth]]. He then dug Guth out with a pick, using an axe to chop off any limb that was revealed, soon killing the knight.
