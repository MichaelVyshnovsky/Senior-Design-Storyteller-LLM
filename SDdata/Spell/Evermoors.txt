The '''Evermoors''', or '''Trollmoors''', was a region of the [[Savage Frontier]] that comprised hills and troughs, partially filled with chilly bogs and rolling landscapes. It was a place that clouded the senses, with dense fog that permeated travelers' field of vision and winds that roared within their ears.

In addition to the [[troll]]s that famously infested its bogs, the Evermoors were home to a variety of other monstrous creatures. Despite this, a few scattered drovers, shepherds and prospectors managed to eke out a life within.

==Geography==
The Evermoors were a large and unpopulated area 

The [[Laughingflow]] river originated deep within the Evermoors, meeting the River Surbrin after it passed though the Surbrin Hills.

The major road that linked [[Yartar]] to [[Everlund]], known as the [[Evermoor Way]], passed between the Evermoors and the High Forest.

==Geographical Features==
{{Climate/Silver Marches/Open country|the Evermoors}}
The moors were formed by large rocky plateaus, sporadically interspersed by very steep small gorges dug by the water. Soil-covered tors and rocks dotted the moors' bog water, and small hills and peaks rose from the shroud of fog.

Rich veins of [[copper]], [[lead]], and even [[gold]] ran through the moors' rocky outcroppings and it was believed that further wealth could be found deep beneath its waters.

===Ruins===
The region was the resting place for a number of long-dead dwarves and [[Netherese]] [[human]]s: the landscape was dotted with their burial mounds&mdash;some of which held great magical treasures&mdash;as well as the sporadic ruined castle. Beyond that, the southern reaches of the Evermoors housed a number of ruined settlements that humanity had been forced to abandon.

==History==
In ages long forgotten, humans attempted to settle the Evermoors, but their civilizations fell into ruin.

In the {{YearlinkName|775}}, an army of [[orc]]s and [[goblin]]s led by [[ogre]]s emerged from the Evermoors. To stand against them, the [[Covenant]] of [[Neverwinter]] manipulated the [[Uthgardt]] tribes into an alliance that successfully defeated the threat. In the course of the fighting, the [[Elk tribe]] were nearly annihilated while defending [[Flint Rock]], reducing the proud tribe to become little more than bandits.

In the [[First Trollwar]] of the {{YearlinkName|932}}, trolls poured forth from the Evermoors, and [[Nimoar]] led his forces from [[Nimoar's Hold]] to famously eradicate the trolls in the Evermoors, scorching much of its terrain in the process. Scorch marks from this slaughter remained visible for hundreds of years.

In the [[Second Trollwar]] of the {{YearlinkName|952}}, trolls from the Evermoors once again attacked the [[North]], and were once again driven back and eradicated, this time by an alliance between [[Ahghairon]] of [[Waterdeep]], [[Aeroth of Silverymoon]], and the brothers [[Samular Caradoon]] of [[Tyr]] and [[Renwick Caradoon]]. The turning point against the trolls was a grueling nine-day struggle that came to be known as the [[Long Battle]].

After the number of troll attacks on the town of [[Nesmé]] increased in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, an unknown entity drove them away from the moors.

A community of [[Fog giant|fog]] and [[cloud giant]]s made them home within the Evermoors in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}. They were soon followed the [[1370 DR|next year]] by a band of [[hill giant|hill]] and [[frost giant]]s that traveled from the [[Spine of the World]] mountains. As was so common throughout the moors' history, this migration forced out much of the local troll population.

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the floating castle of [[Sansuri|Countess Sansuri]]&mdash;known as [[Lyn Armaal]]&mdash;hovered high in the skies above the Evermoors. 

==Rumors & Legends==
Due to the rich amounts of ore found within the moors' rocky outcroppings, some expert miners believed that a vast network of caverns ran underneath its murky waters.

==Notable locations==
;Landmarks:
* [[Old Man (mountain)|The Old Man]], a tor jutting out from the moors that resembled the visage of an elderly man.
* [[Startop]], a peak that came to a distinct point, and on clear nights it caught the moonlight just right so as to resemble a twinkling star.

;Settlements:
* [[Griffon's Nest]], the small village that served as the home of the [[Griffon tribe]] of [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s.
* [[Hethridge Drop]], an abandoned village that had been deserted sometime before [[1374 DR]].{{Cite dungeon/144/The Muster of Morach Tor|20}}
* [[Nesmé]], while always being threatened by the trolls and [[barbarian]]s of the moors, this town endured for some time,

==Inhabitants==
The Evermoors were infamous for its infestation of trolls, who were known to ravage the surrounding settlements. As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, a two-headed troll by the name of [[Proffit]] was known to lead a massive force of trolls and bog blokes.

Five tribes of orcs roamed across the Evermoors during the mid–14{{th}} century DR, preying on anyone who traveled along the Evermoor Way. Unlike many orc tribes, these had witch-doctors in place of [[shaman]]s and worshiped the god [[Bhaal]].

The region was also known to be home to savage [[ettin]]s, ogres, and various types of [[giant]]s, including fog, cloud, and [[hill giant]]s.

The [[black dragon]] [[Rakor]] once prowled the Evermoors.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}
