        "mainbody": "Danse macabre was a spell used by warlocks and wizards to raise the dead. \nWhen cast, up to five corpses within  were reanimated as undead. The caster was able to command the creatures. If no command was given, the undead only defended themselves if attacked. The undead followed the casters command until it was fulfilled. When the spell expired, the spell was lifted and the undead collapsed, becoming corpses once more. \nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
