Isoldes answer was a rare, lesser divination which extracted answers out of any scrying device.
When cast upon an existing and operating scrying device, the spell allowed the caster to ask one question. If the question could be answered by showing something that the device could show, and that was within range of the spell (typically , though more was possible for more experienced mages), that scene would become the target of the scrying device.
Besides verbal and somatic components, the spell called for an existing, operating scrying device. It was not consumed in the spell.
