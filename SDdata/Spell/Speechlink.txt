Speechlink was a spell used by bards.
When cast, this spell allowed the caster and a targeted creature to communicate instantly, even over great distances. The targeted creature had to be willing for the spell to function. The spell transmitted only the voice of the individual, it did not transmit any background noise. Either individual could cancel the spell at any time. While the spell could be cast on any creature, even animals, the spell did not provide translation or comprehension for different languages.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
