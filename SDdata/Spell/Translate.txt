'''''Translate''''' was a very rare [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s.
 
==Effects==
When cast, this spell allowed the caster to read written text in various languages, including [[thieves' cant]]. The spell was unable to translate encrypted messages, [[arcane]]-magic spells, spell scrolls or recipes for potions or magical powders. The spell could be used with the ''[[scribe]]'' spell if the translated text was to be written on another document.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]].
