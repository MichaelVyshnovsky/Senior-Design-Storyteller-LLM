Translate was a very rare spell used by clerics.
When cast, this spell allowed the caster to read written text in various languages, including thieves cant. The spell was unable to translate encrypted messages, arcane-magic spells, spell scrolls or recipes for potions or magical powders. The spell could be used with the scribe spell if the translated text was to be written on another document.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component.
