        "mainbody": "'''''Mordenkainen's disjunction''''' was a powerful [[abjuration]] spell that reduced [[magic item]]s and effects to their basic components, effectively and permanently canceling them.This spell was renamed to be non-setting-specific and copyright-friendly in the [http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/magesDisjunction.htm d20 SRD]. To [[Zakhara]]n mages, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''disjunction''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].",
        "Effects": "The spell caused all magic effects and items to be broken down (or \"disjoined\") into their basic components.&mdash;but magic items were stripped of their [[Item enchantment|enchantments]] and reverted to mundane items. The wearer of a magic item subjected to ''disjunction'' might try to assert their own willpower to try to prevent the item from being disjoined. The caster was generally able to exclude their own magical possessions from the effects of the spell.\n\n''Mordenkainen's disjunction'' was so powerful that even magical places, legendary [[artifact]]s, and [[spelljamming helm]]s were not entirely immune to its dissociating magic. There was a chance, albeit small, that an artifact or helm could be stripped of its magic, also permanently maiming the magical capabilities of its wearer. Of course, the destruction of a powerful artifact ran the risk of calling the attention of powerful beings associated with that artifact.\n\nThe best way to protect magic items from ''Mordenkainen's disjunction'' was to place them inside an area of ''antimagic'', however the spell even had a chance of overcoming the effect of an ''[[antimagic field]]'' if the caster was sufficiently powerful, in which case any items protected by it would be disjoined as normal.\n\n''Mordenkainen's disjunction'' was one of the few magics powerful enough to cancel the effect of other mighty spells that might otherwise require a ''[[wish]]'' or ''[[miracle]]'' to end. For example, it could undo ''[[binding]]'' spells or powerful ''[[guards and wards]]'', and could could also unmake ''[[Algarth's embattlement]]'', ''[[Belorigar's baldric]]'', ''[[greater spell trigger]]'' ''[[prismatic sphere]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]''. It could also be used to counter ''[[dispel shunt]]'' or ''[[antimagic shell]]'', but was not guaranteed to succeed. The [[Nephthys|Nephthysan]] spell ''[[enduring ward]]'' could also protect a magical glyph or symbol against one casting of ''Mordenkainen's disjunction'', but the ''enduring ward'' effect would be destroyed in the process.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[verbal component]]s. \n\nWhile not a [[somatic component]] per se, the caster could use their hands to touch a magic item that they wished to exclude from the effect of the spell.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Mordenkainen]] of [[Oerth]] but had found its way to [[spellbook]]s in [[Faerûn]]<ref name=¨VGATM2e-p109\"> and [[Zakhara]],{{AQ-time}} however it was considered a rarity as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. [[Sammaster]] included the spell in his ''[[Tome of the Dragon]]'', which he distributed to cells of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].\n\nThe [[avatar]]s of both [[Maanzecorian]] and the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]] were said to wield the spell. [[Clockwork horror|Adamantine clockwork horror]]s were said to be equipped with a [[wand]] capable of casting it.{{Cite dragon/350/The Ecology of the Clockwork Horror|60}} As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the [[dracolich]] [[Daurgothoth]] was working on developing a way to wield the power of ''Mordenkainen's disjunction'' as a breath weapon.\n\nDespite its primary use for destroying enchanted items, it was possible to imbue an artifact-level item with the powers of ''Mordenkainen's disjunction''. Such an enchantment was greatly sought-after by those who wished to slay [[mage]]s."
