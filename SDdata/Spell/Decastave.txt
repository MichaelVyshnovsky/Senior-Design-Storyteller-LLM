'''''Decastave''''' was an [[evocation]]/[[conjuration]] [[spell]] that converted a small piece of wood into a force-[[staff]] that could be wielded as a [[magic]] weapon.

==Effects==
The magical pole was of fixed length, 8'-10' (2.4 m - 3 m) long 2" (5 cm) in diameter, and rigidly inflexible. It could be wielded like a [[quarterstaff]], possessed the ''[[thundering]]'' quality and could damage creatures immune to non-magical weapons. The ''decastave'' could be dissipated in a few ways:
* The wizard let go of it intentionally or accidentally.
* It was pulled from the wizard's grasp by one or more opponents exerting sufficient strength in a united effort.
* It was cleaved by metal.
* The spell's duration was exceeded.

Once per casting of this spell, the wizard could elect to drain a small amount of health upon a successful hit. The health was transferred to the wizard similar to a ''[[vampiric touch]]'' but could not increase health beyond normal capacity.

==Components==
This spell required verbal and somatic components, and a small piece of wood that was consumed by the casting.

==History==
This spell was generally well-known around [[Faer√ªn]] once it had been published in the book, ''[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]'', in [[1359 DR]].
