        "Effects": "''Weighed in the balance'' was a spell that affected all creatures within 30 feet (9 meters) of the caster. The exact effect, which the affected creatures felt depended on two factors, what kind of [[alignment|moral and ethical outlook]] the affected creature had and whether the affected creature was an [[undead]].\n\nIf a creature had a [[true neutral]] outlook, meaning no extreme ethical or moral views, the creature experienced a ''[[cure critical wounds]]'' effect. If the creature had an extreme outlook regarding ethics or morals, but a balanced view on the other, meaning [[chaotic neutral]], [[neutral evil]], and [[neutral good]] creatures, suffered an ''[[inflict light wounds]]'' effect. Creatures with extreme views on life, meaning [[chaotic evil]], [[chaotic good]], [[lawful evil]], and [[lawful good]] creatures, suffered an ''[[inflict critical wounds]]'' effect.\n\nThe second criteria, whether the affected creature was an undead or not, determined whether the creature came under the effects of a ''[[heal]]'' effect.",
        "Components": "''Weighed in the balance'' required merely [[verbal component]]s."
