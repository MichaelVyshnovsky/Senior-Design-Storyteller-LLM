'''''Prismatic ray''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that fired a beam of colored light from the caster's hand to a target creature. The beam could temporarily blind those affected, and had various other properties based on its color.

==Effects==
The beam could be fired at a range of one hundred feet, or more if the caster were particularly powerful. The color-dependent properties were as follows:

{|border="1" align="center" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse:collapse; margin-left:5px;"
|style="text-align:left; background-color:#B0E0E6;"| '''Color'''
|style="text-align:left; background-color:#B0E0E6;"| '''Effect'''
|-
| Red || Fire damage
|-
| Orange || Acid damage
|-
| Yellow || Electricity damage
|-
| Green || Target poisoned
|-
| Blue || Target turned to stone
|-
| Indigo || Target turned insane
|-
| Violet || Target sent to another [[plane]]
|}

Occasionally, two effects could be triggered simultaneously.

The interplay of arcane energies involved in this spell could cause sensations of nausea in the caster.

==Components==
The spell had both [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.

==Notable Users==
* The ''[[scepter of the ar-magus]]'', a [[magic]]al scepter associated with the [[primordial]] [[Bazim-Gorag]], could be used to cast ''prismatic ray'' (among other spells).
