Locate note was a divination spell that allowed the caster to detect the direction of a node within a certain range.
Formerly believed to be able to detect only eath nodes, upon casting this spell, the location of any node was revealed to the spellcaster. It had an area of effect that extended out for miles, depending on the casters power and experience. This distance was increased if the location of the node was somewhere they had previously visited.
The spell could not detect nodes that had been affected by the node lock spell or that were protected by a sheet of lead.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of a small pebble that had been taken from a node.
