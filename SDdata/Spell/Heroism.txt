'''''Heroism''''' was an [[enchantment]] or [[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed the target to fight as if it were many times greater.

==Effects==
As a result of the spells found after {{yearlink|1372}}, the target became braver. The target became better at fighting, at resisting other effects, and at doing generally everything.

Earlier versions, based on [[transmutation]], operated by boosting the life energy of the target, and affected only the martially minded; those granted increased staying power, and far superior performance in combat.

==Components==
The spell only required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s. The earliest versions called for an [[oak]] leaf, or a [[holy symbol]].

==History==
The arcane version of the spell was developed by [[grey elf]] mages. It was very jealously guarded as of {{yearlink|1368}}.
