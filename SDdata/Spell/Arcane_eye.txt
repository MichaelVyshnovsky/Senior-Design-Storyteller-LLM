Arcane eye, also known as wizard eye,
The spell would create an invisible floating "eye", which would provide the caster with visual information. and with a normal visual range after that to  per minute. It moved more slowly if the caster was looking more than only straight ahead. The eye could be created anywhere within sight but could move to any distance from the caster.
Solid barriers blocked the eye, but it could fit through holes that were not smaller than its diameter. It could not pass through portals or other means of entering other planes.
Although the eye could not be used unless the caster was actively concentrating, a break in concentration merely disabled the eye and did not end the spell, and concentration could be resumed later.
