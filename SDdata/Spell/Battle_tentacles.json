        "mainbody": "Battle tentacles was a wizardly spell that conjured deadly black tentacles that lashed at every creature within the spells area of effect.\nWhen cast, battle tentacles littered the area with sprouting black rubbery tentacles that emerged from any surface the spell targeted, including water and water surfaces. The tentacles were covered in sporadic fin-like razor-sharp spines. The magical appendages flailed angrily, slamming and cutting everything within their reach. The longer the spell remained active, the more slams these tentacles landed on the creatures trapped within their reach. The spells range depended on the casters arcane ability, but the summoned tentacles always covered an area with a radius of . The length of the spell increased the stronger the spellcaster was as well. To their summoner, the tentacles were incorporeal, allowing them to move through the flailing limbs freely.\nBattle tentacles required verbal, somatic, and material components. In order to cast this spell, the caster had to acquire a chunk of a tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid, as well as a piece of a spine or bone of any aquatic creature.\nBattle tentacles were among the spells that were exchanged between Elminster Aumar, Mordenkainen, and Rautheene, during one of the regular meetings of the Wizards Three in the home of Ed Greenwood of Earth. The topic of discussion of that particular assembly was \"battle spells.\""
