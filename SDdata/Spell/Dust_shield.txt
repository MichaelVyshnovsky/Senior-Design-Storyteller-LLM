Dust shield was a southern magic divine spell available to worshipers of Geb.
When cast, the spell created an impenetrable barrier of dust. Once the barrier was in place, it could not be moved by the caster. Only the dispel magic spell or a mental command from the caster could remove the barrier before the spell expires. The caster was able to cast the spell around one of their arms, providing a full body shield. If a caster cast it in this fashion, they were unable to wield a shield or in conjunction with the shield spell.
In addition to a verbal component, this spell required material components, a small amount of dust along with the casters holy symbol.
