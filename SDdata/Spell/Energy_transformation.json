        "mainbody": "Energy transformation was a complex alteration spell that created a permanent arcane field that absorbed magical energies and transferred them to other existing spell effects, thereby extending their duration.\nThe magical field created by the spell spell was a  radius sphere centered upon a single location. Within that area of effect, the energy released by any cast spells was absorbed and its effects were greatly diminished. Furthermore, any magical items that possessed outwardly-expressed spell-like effects began to function in an inconsistent manner, as the magical power within them was similarly consumed. For example a torch altered with the spell continual light would flicker when it was carried through the zone affected by the spell energy transformation.\nThis spell did not effect any spells or items whose magic originated from the abjuration or conjuration schools of magic. It caused no damage or degenerative effects to magical items that did not possess spell-like functions.\nThe area of absorption created by this spell could only be destroyed by the spells Mordenkainens disjunction, limited wish or wish.\nWhen energy transformation was cast, the caster had to specifically name the existing magic to which the spells area of effect was linked. They also had to outline any limitations that were to be expressed within the absorption field.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a number of material components. It required three \"permanent\" magical items, which were consumed during the spells casting three drops of the casters blood a single eyeball extracted from a living creature and a diamond, worth at least 5000 gp, which was ground into a fine powder. It took just under half a minute for this spell to be cast.\nThis spell was used extensively by the \"Mad Mage\" Halaster Blackcloak, especially throughout the corridors of the Undermountain. Its labyrinthine halls were layered with overlapping absorption fields that furthered the myriad of enchantments and spells that protected Halasters lair from magical scrying and divination."
