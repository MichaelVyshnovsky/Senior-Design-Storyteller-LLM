        "mainbody": "Unlife was a necromancy spell that caused the death of person or creature, and immediately raised them as an undead minion.\nUpon touch, the caster of the spell slayed a living creature unless they could somehow resist its effects. Immediately upon their death, the affected target was transformed into an undead being, under the control of the caster. Depending on the accumulated experience, knowledge and power of the spells recipient, they were risen as a skeleton, zombie, ghoul, wight or wraith.\nThis spell required verbal, somatic and material components in its casting,the latter of which was dirt taken from a fresh grave. It could only be cast by evil-aligned spellcasters.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
