        },
        "Government": "Each of the three main sentient populations living on Coliar had a different government system.\n\nThe [[lizardfolk]] inhabitants lived under a type of communistic rule, equally sharing all wealth among each inhabitant and with no particular individual exerting control over another. In addition, all spelljammer ships belonged to the entire population, so every inhabitant had a chance to use them. The main use of spelljamming ships was for the lizardfolk to place their eggs on them and to take them to be hatched close to the [[The Sun|Sun]], which they believed generated superior offspring. By [[1367 DR]], the lizardfolk director of spelljamming operations on Coliar was [[Schlith Darkscale]].\n\nThe [[aarakocra]] lived under at least 100 separate governments, all of them democratic. Leaders were chosen by votes from the entire local aarakocra community and ruled for seven-year terms. The ruler of Coliar's largest aarakocra clan around [[1367 DR]] was [[Alekra Donakkis]]. For all family populations, all important government posts were occupied by females.\n\nThe [[dragon]]s kept a neutral and peaceful existence on the planet, mostly keeping to their own families, but also cooperating with each other, even across different dragon species. They also kept a symbiotic relationship with the other two populations.",
        "Trade": "The main export of Coliar was its air. However, air was a difficult commodity to sell because most [[spelljammer]] ships usually just stole what air they needed.\n\nThe aarakocra inhabitants also mined [[gem]]s from the inner islands and exported them in exchange for weapons, which they used in their territorial disputes against the lizardfolk.\n\nThe lizardfolk, on the other hand, exported aarakocra meat and feathers, as well as gems, air, and [[water]], in exchange for spelljamming technology, which they used to power ships that would carry their eggs to be hatched close to the Sun. In order to enforce the purchasing of air and water, lizardfolk ports charged an air tax to any ships that docked at them.\n\nThe [[dragon]] inhabitants mostly ignored ships, unless provoked.",
        "Notable Locations": "The two most popular ports of Coliar were [[Hisssta]] and [[Athanar]].\n\nAt the center of the planet was a very large island, inhabited by the [[red dragon]] [[wyrm]] [[Firebrand Flametongue]]. Very few people were allowed to approach the central island without being attacked by the dragon.\n\nClose to the center floated [[Elminster's Hideout]], a metallic spherical island about {{SI|250|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. It served as a hideout to [[Elminster Aumar]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The planet's different cultures often used ''[[horn of voices|horns of voices]]'' to communicate with each other over large areas. In particular, this device was fundamental in the election process of the planet's aarakocra leaders.\n\nColiar dragons had a longer life span than dragons elsewhere. Older dragons also had the ability to use a form of ''[[shape air]]'' in order to create new bodies for themselves, which sometimes made it possible for them to travel anywhere in the universe under the form of [[air dragon]]s.\n\nOther notable inhabitants of Coliar included:\n\n* [[Arisai Heliwing]], the powerful and ruthless aarakocra merchant who owned several ships and ports throughout the planet."
