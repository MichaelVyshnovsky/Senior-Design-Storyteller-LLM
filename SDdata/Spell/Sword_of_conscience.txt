Sword of conscience was an enchantment spell that filled an evil target with pangs of remorse and regret.
An evil creature within a short range was instantly "pierced through the heart" (metaphorically) with a guilty conscience. The feelings of remorse were so intense that they affected the creatures ability to act wisely or with any charisma, and the strength of this result depended on the extent of the targets evil.
This spell required verbal components and a cleric or paladins holy symbol as a divine focus.
