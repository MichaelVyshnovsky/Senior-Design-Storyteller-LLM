        "mainbody": "'''''Repulsion''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that prevented creatures from approaching the caster. It was a common spell on [[Toril]]. It had a [[Divine magic|divine]] version developed by the [[drow]] similar to an [[arcane]] version developed by the [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Prug]]. By the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], a new version of this spell appeared that both divine and arcane spellcasters could use.",
        "Effects": "As mentioned above, the ''repulsion'' spell had three versions. All versions made it impossible for creatures to get near the caster, but there were a few differences in range, duration, area of effect, and components.\n\nThe arcane Netherese and divine drow versions of this spell created a 10 ft (3 m) wide corridor that stretched for at least 330 ft (100 m) in a chosen direction from the caster. Beings caught in this corridor moved away from the caster at whatever rate they had been moving toward the caster. The Netherese version was a bit more capable because creatures could not resist the spell and did not have to be visible to the caster (or vice versa).\n\nThe newest version of this spell had a spherical area of effect centered on the caster, but extended out to a maximum radius of only 130 ft (40 m) (casters could choose a smaller radius and more experienced casters could extend this range). Creatures caught in the area of effect (and that failed to resist) were not sent away, but merely prevented from approaching the caster for a minute or more. The sphere moved with the caster, so the caster could choose to approach a ''repulsed'' creature but not vice versa. Beings in the invisible ''repulsion'' field were not otherwise impeded and could fight other targets or even fire ranged weapons at the caster.",
        "Components": "All versions of this spell required [[somatic]] and [[verbal]] components to cast. Throughout the [[Age of Humanity]] the arcane version of ''repulsion'' required two small canine statuettes, one ebony and one [[ivory]], each mounted on a small bar of [[iron]] that was magnetized.{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|37}}\n\nThe drow version needed the priest's [[holy symbol]]; a knife, [[dagger]], or miniature [[sword]]; and a source of ignition such as a spark, flame, hot [[coal]], or ember. All but the holy symbol were consumed in the casting.\n\nFor the newest version of ''repulsion'', clerics could cast it using just their holy symbol. Wizards and sorcerers had to acquire the canine statuettes on iron bars, but the only requirement was \"one black, one white\" and costing about 50 [[gp]]. Unlike the original version, the statuettes functioned as an arcane focus and were not consumed in the casting.",
        "History": "The [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Prug]] is given the credit for the creation of this spell in {{Yearlink|-1815}} under its original name '''''Prug's repulse'''''."
