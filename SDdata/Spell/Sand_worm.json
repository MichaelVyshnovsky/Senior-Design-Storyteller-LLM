        "Effects": "This spell turned the recipient into a sand worm; a man-sized worm that no longer needed to eat, drink, or breathe. The sand worm could easily burrow through [[sand]] and loose earth. It could detect heat from living things up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} while underground and that ranged was doubled above ground. Transforming into the worm partially healed the recipient.\n\nSand worms were able to move faster while burrowing than they could on the surface.",
        "Components": "This spell required a live worm to cast."
