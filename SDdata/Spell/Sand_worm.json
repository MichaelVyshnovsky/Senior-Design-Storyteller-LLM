        "mainbody": "Sand worm was a spell used by wizards in Anauroch and Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell turned the recipient into a sand worm a man-sized worm that no longer needed to eat, drink, or breathe. The sand worm could easily burrow through sand and loose earth. It could detect heat from living things up to  while underground and that ranged was doubled above ground. Transforming into the worm partially healed the recipient.\nSand worms were able to move faster while burrowing than they could on the surface.\nThis spell required a live worm to cast."
