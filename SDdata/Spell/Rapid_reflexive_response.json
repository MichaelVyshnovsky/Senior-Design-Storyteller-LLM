        "mainbody": "Rapid reflexive response was a spell unique to Halruaa.\nRamael the Reader created this spell, but many Halruaans credited Mycontil.\nWhen cast, this spell allowed the caster to snatch any missile weighing less than 7 lbs. (3.2 kg ) out of the air and immediately throw it back at their attacker with startling accuracy. One object could be grabbed with each hand.\nThis spell would also enhance the speed of any hand-related movement by the caster for its duration. Because of this, the caster would need to end the spell before attempting to cast a different spell.\nThis spell required a glove that was once worn by a throwing weapons specialist (or a halfling), a shaving of licorice root, and a frogs tongue to cast."
