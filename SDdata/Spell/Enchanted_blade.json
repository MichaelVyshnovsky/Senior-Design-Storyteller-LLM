        "mainbody": "Enchanted blade was a common spell used by wu jen. The spell was extremely rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThe spell summoned a magical longsword. The sword was very light and was covered in magical energy, constantly throwing off sparks of electricity. The sword was able to cast a bolt of energy to a target up to 30 feet (9 meters) from the wu jen. The sword was very powerful in melee combat, inflicting several times more damage than a regular sword, and was effective against creatures who were vulnerable only to magical weapons. The sword vanished when the spell expired.\nIf a wu jen cast this spell in the phlogiston, the sword reacted with the phlogiston and lost effectiveness the longer it was summoned, and the wu jen and any creature around them would suffer damage.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components a silver rod and a small sword made of wood."
