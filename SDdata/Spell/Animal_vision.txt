'''''Animal vision''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell of the [[southern magic]] tradition that linked a priest's vision to a single animal of any kind, but usually an animal sacred to the priest's god.{{Southernmagic}}

==Effects==
The caster had to be able to see or touch the animal to cast this spell. ''Animal vision'' lasted as long as the creature was within the spell's range or until the spell expired or was terminated, and halted if the animal or priest were killed. If the animal was killed while the spell was in effect, there were no negative consequences to the casting priest. The spell only linked to the vision of the animal. Other spells such as ''[[control animal]]'' could be used to direct the animal, if desired.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small piece of something the target animal desired, such as food.
