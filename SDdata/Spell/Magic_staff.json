        "mainbody": "'''''Magic staff''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to store spells within their staff. Caster's with more expertise were capable of storing more spells in this manner. In order to store a spell the wizard cast the desired spell while charging the staff. The spell required the normal components and was still wiped from the caster's memory. Any spell stored within the staff had a drastically decreased casting time.\n\nSpells stored within the ''magic staff'' remained until cast, ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'', or after several hours passed at which point they would disappear from the staff. Any wizard who knew the ''magic staff'' spell could cast spells stored within another wizard's ''magic staff''. However, wizards often imbued their staff with a command word that was required to bring forth the stored spells.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a staff cut from an [[ash]] tree to cast. [[Rubies]] worth 1,000 [[gp]] each needed to be inlaid into the staff. More powerful stored spells required more rubies."
