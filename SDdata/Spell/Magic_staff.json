        "mainbody": "Magic staff was an enchantment spell used by wizards.\nThis spell allowed the caster to store spells within their staff. Casters with more expertise were capable of storing more spells in this manner. In order to store a spell the wizard cast the desired spell while charging the staff. The spell required the normal components and was still wiped from the casters memory. Any spell stored within the staff had a drastically decreased casting time.\nSpells stored within the magic staff remained until cast, dispelled, or after several hours passed at which point they would disappear from the staff. Any wizard who knew the magic staff spell could cast spells stored within another wizards magic staff. However, wizards often imbued their staff with a command word that was required to bring forth the stored spells.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a staff cut from an ash tree to cast. Rubies worth 1,000 gp each needed to be inlaid into the staff. More powerful stored spells required more rubies."
