        "mainbody": "Kelemvors grace was a divine abjuration spell that protected an individual from all non-physical attacks of the undead.\nWhen cast, the caster conferred the spells protections upon themself or a single person they touched. Kelemvors grace made them immune to life-draining effects, certain diseases such as lycanthropy or mummy rot, magical aging effects and supernatural attacks such as the wail of a banshee.\nIf cast directly upon an undead creature, this spell temporarily negated some of their inherent powers. The effects of spells they cast were also delayed until the end of the spells duration.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the clerics holy symbol.\nThis spell was inscribed within the Kelemvorite relic the Testament of Vraer."
