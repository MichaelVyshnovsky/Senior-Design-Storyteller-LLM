        "mainbody": "'''''Kelemvor's grace''''' was a [[divine]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that protected an individual from all non-physical attacks of the [[undead]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, the caster conferred the spell's protections upon themself or a single person they touched. ''Kelemvor's grace'' made them immune to life-draining effects, certain diseases such as [[lycanthropy]] or [[mummy rot]], magical aging effects and supernatural attacks such as the wail of a [[banshee]].\n\nIf cast directly upon an undead creature, this spell temporarily negated some of their inherent powers. The effects of spells they cast were also delayed until the end of the spell's duration.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the cleric's [[holy symbol]].",
        "History": "This spell was inscribed within the [[Kelemvor]]ite [[relic]] the ''[[Testament of Vraer]]''."
