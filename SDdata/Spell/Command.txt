Command was an enchantment spell that forced one subject to briefly obey a one-word command.
The command word had to be given in a language the subject could understand and the effect lasted for only one minute.
Commands that were known to work included approach, back, drop, fall, flee, fly, go, halt, leave, rest, run, sleep, stop, and surrender.
Older versions of this spell could be overcome by creatures of high intelligence or toughness. Newer versions could be overcome by beings of strong will. 
Command only affected living creatures with sufficient intelligence to understand the command word. Undead were completely unaffected.
Only the utterance of the command word was necessary to cast this spell.
