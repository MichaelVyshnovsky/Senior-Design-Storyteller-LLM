        "mainbody": "Sacred strike was a divine necromancy spell that created a whip-like lash of force energy within the hand of the caster.\nThe lash appeared as chain of twinkling, purple motes of light. \nWhen wielded by the casting cleric the lash possessed the properties of an enchanted weapon. When it struck a living being it inflicted great pain upon them and healed the wielder. It was not very effective when used against the undead.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, sacred strike required the material components of a single hair taken from the caster and two drops of unholy water."
