When it struck a living being it inflicted great pain upon them and healed the wielder. It was not very effective when used against the [[undead]].",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, ''sacred strike'' required the [[material component]]s of a single hair taken from the caster and two drops of ''[[unholy water]]''."
