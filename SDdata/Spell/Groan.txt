'''''Groan''''' was a haunting [[cantrip]] that [[wizard]]s-in-training could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It could create the illusory sound of a tortured cry that emanated from close by.

==Effects==
This cantrip produced the auditory illusion of a disembodied expression of grief or pain within a radius of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} from the caster.<ref group="note">The original description of this spell in [[Dragon magazine 60|''Dragon'' #60]] used the 1{{st}}-edition nomenclature <code>1"</code>, meaning {{SI|10|ft}} indoors and {{SI|10|yd}} outdoors. This was simplified to the shorter range in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. The spot chosen for the emanation of the sound could be anywhere within that range, including behind doors, under floors, or inside a chest of drawers. Creatures in the vicinity that could be expected to hear the sound had a chance to resist the spell. If successful, they did not notice the illusion.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster surreptitiously imitated a groaning sound while pointing at the location from which the sound was to emanate.
