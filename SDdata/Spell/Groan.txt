Groan was a haunting cantrip that wizards-in-training could learn. It could create the illusory sound of a tortured cry that emanated from close by.
This cantrip produced the auditory illusion of a disembodied expression of grief or pain within a radius of  from the caster.The original description of this spell in Dragon #60 used the 1-edition nomenclature 1", meaning  indoors and  outdoors. This was simplified to the shorter range in Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four. The spot chosen for the emanation of the sound could be anywhere within that range, including behind doors, under floors, or inside a chest of drawers. Creatures in the vicinity that could be expected to hear the sound had a chance to resist the spell. If successful, they did not notice the illusion.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster surreptitiously imitated a groaning sound while pointing at the location from which the sound was to emanate.
