        "mainbody": "'''''Stone shape''''' was a [[transmutation]] spell or [[alteration]] spell that reshaped stone objects.",
        "Effects": "Fine detail was not possible, but natural or worked stone could be manipulated by means of this spell to form most any shape the caster desired&mdash;an arch, a statue, a door, or a wall with a hole in it, for example. If small moving parts were required, there was a chance the mechanism just wouldn't function.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spellcaster needed a [[material component]] in the form of a lump of [[clay]]. This clay had to be crudely molded into the desired shape and then brought into contact with the stone to be reshaped. Some druids also required [[mistletoe]].",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Proctiv]] in {{Yearlink|-2110}} and was originally called '''''Proctiv's shape stone'''''.\n\n[[Urdunnir]] [[dwarves]] were blessed by [[Dumathoin]] with the ability to cast ''stone shape'' whenever they wished."
