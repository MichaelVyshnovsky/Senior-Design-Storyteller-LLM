Favor of Yathaghera was a divine alteration spell that gave wings to horses and used by specialty priests devoted to Lurue called Silvermaids.
This spell caused an equine target, including a centaur, to sprout the wings of a pegasus for several hours, allowing them to fly. The spell also made the spellcaster proficient with handling the flying mount for the duration of the spell but the target could only be ridden bareback. Any saddle placed upon the target would simply fall off. The steed behaved as if it were born with the wings.
If used on an equine target that already had wings, such as a pegasus, then the targets flying speed was doubled and their aerial maneuverability was enhanced.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a feather from a pegasus and the priestesss holy symbol to cast.
