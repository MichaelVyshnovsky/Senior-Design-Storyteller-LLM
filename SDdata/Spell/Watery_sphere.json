        "mainbody": "'''''Watery sphere''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that created a sphere of water capable of trapping creatures inside.",
        "Effects": "The spell created within a range of {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} a massive sphere made of swirling water with a radius of {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} that floated above the ground at a height of up to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}. The sphere lasted for up to 1 minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating. If the sphere was summoned on top of a creature or rammed onto one, the creature became trapped within the sphere, unless the target was larger than the sphere itself or able to push free. The sphere was capable of holding up to four [[human]]-sized creatures, or one [[ogre]]-sized creature, at once.\n\nWhen the sphere dissipated, the released water extinguished all non-magical flames around it, then disappeared, releasing all trapped creatures and dropping them on the ground.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was a droplet of water."
