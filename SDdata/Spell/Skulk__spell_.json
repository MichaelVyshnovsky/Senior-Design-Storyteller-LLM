        "mainbody": "'''''Skulk''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[illusion]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Ibrandul]], enabling them to move like a [[chameleon]].",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to move quickly, quietly, and to blend with their surroundings when motionless. Even skilled trackers had a hard time following anyone under the influence of a ''skulk'' spell.\n\nThere was a small cumulative chance that the caster would be permanently transformed into a [[skulk]] with each use of this spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]], a small piece of skin from a chameleon, and a dead [[spider]] to cast."
