        "mainbody": "Cloud trapeze was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the spell created a magical cloud, which transported a wu jen at incredible speed. The wu jen had complete control over the clouds direction. A wu jen was able to transport one humanoid-sized creature the number of additional passengers was dependent on the skill level of the wu jen. The cloud was able to travel up to 100 miles (160 kilometers).  \nThe spell also protected the riders from weather if a wu jen rode the magical cloud into a storm, they would remain dry and unaffected by the wind. When the caster reached their destination, the cloud slowly descended and then vanished when the caster was on the ground.\nWhen in wildspace, the magical cloud was unable to travel outside the atmosphere of a spelljammer.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a ball of cotton."
