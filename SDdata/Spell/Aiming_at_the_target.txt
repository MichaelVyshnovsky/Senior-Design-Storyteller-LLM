'''''Aiming at the target''''' was an [[invocation]] or [[abjuration]] [[spell]] known to the [[wu jen]] of [[Kara-Tur]] in the 1350s [[DR]], though it was available to [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s by the 1370s DR. It prevented them from breaking concentration on an action, no matter what else they were doing.

==Effects==
The spell enabled a mage to keep concentrating on any one action, such as maintaining another spell, regardless of any other distracting action they undertook, by greatly boosting their ability to concentrate. Casting this spell was swift, even instantaneous, and it did not even interrupt concentration on an existing spell. For example, a wu jen might cast a spell that required concentration like ''[[phantasmal force]]'', then cast ''aiming at the target'', then move at full speed, defend themselves or resist effects as normal, or take injury, and still maintain the ''phantasmal force''. The wu jen's mind was focused on the existing spell but remained fully aware of events. ''Aiming at the target'' lasted until the first spell was no longer concentrated on, or until two minutes or twenty minutes had passed.

==Components==
The spell required only [[somatic component]]s. To cast it, the wu jen performed precisely controlled breathing exercises to calm and clear their mind, which released the energy of the spell. Meanwhile, a wizard or sorcerer intoned certain words of power to release the spell, and thereafter felt more focused.

==Known Users==
Around [[1352 DR|Wa Year 1770 (1352 DR)]], the great wu jen [[Setsu Iki]] had it in his spellbook and prepared it twice,<ref> while the [[Hengeyokai|sparrow hengeyokai]] wu jen [[May T'ang Lien]] also had it in her spellbook.<ref>

In [[1357 DR|Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR)]], [[Yen-ch'eng Tzu Yu]], a wu jen of the [[Many-Hued Peacock Society]], possessed a [[scroll]] of ''aiming at the target''.<ref>
