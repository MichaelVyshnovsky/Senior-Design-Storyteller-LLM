        "mainbody": "Biting shadow was an improved version of the spell slicing shadow.\nWhen this spell was cast, it conjured a dark cloud that appeared to have a number of gaping maws lined with fangs. It could be willed by the caster to slowly drift in any direction.\nAny person or creature caught within the biting shadow was bit by its many mouths.\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast."
