        "Effects": "This cantrip produced a full-head illusion that altered the looks of a target humanoid within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster. It only covered the head and lasted between three and six minutes. All aspects of appearance could be altered including eyes, ears, skin, hair, facial features, and the shape of the head.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster envisioned the desired appearance and then touched their face while speaking a word that was descriptive of the change."
