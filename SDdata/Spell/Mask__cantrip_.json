        "mainbody": "Mask was a minor illusion cantrip that beginning illusionists could learn. It disguised the face and head of a target humanoid for a few minutes.\nThis cantrip produced a full-head illusion that altered the looks of a target humanoid within  of the caster. It only covered the head and lasted between three and six minutes. All aspects of appearance could be altered including eyes, ears, skin, hair, facial features, and the shape of the head.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster envisioned the desired appearance and then touched their face while speaking a word that was descriptive of the change."
