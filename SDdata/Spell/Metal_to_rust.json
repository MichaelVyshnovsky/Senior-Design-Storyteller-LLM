        "mainbody": "Metal to rust was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, this spell allowed a wu jen to transform metal into rust. The metal was required to be ferrous. When applied to metal objects with magical properties, there was a chance the spell would fail. The spell was instantaneous the metal began rusting upon a single touch of the wu jen, disintegrating into large flakes of rust. \nThe reverse of this spell was rust to metal, which reversed the effects of metal to rust. It could also restore any rusted metal object, but it required nearly all of the original material to be present. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a vial of seawater or salt water."
