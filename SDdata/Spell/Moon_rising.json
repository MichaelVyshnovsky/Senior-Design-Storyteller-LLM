        "mainbody": "Moon rising was a divine alteration and abjuration spell from the combat sphere that created a mystical aura that proved beneficial to casting clerical spells.\nMoon risings aura resembled moonlight but could still be used during the daytime, making it practically invisible. The aura extended from the caster for  in all directions and lasted for two minutes. Any clerical spells cast within the aura experienced maximum results. This benefit also applied to any enemy priests casting spells within the aura. The caster could also choose to augment one specific action occurring with each minute that the aura lasted, making it much more likely for that action to succeed.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nMoon rising was granted to priests of Sel√ªne, the Moonmaiden."
