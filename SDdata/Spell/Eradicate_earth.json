        "mainbody": "'''''Eradicate earth''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that was dangerous for creatures who had elemental earth as part of its being.",
        "Effects": "''Eradicate earth'' was a very straightforward spell. On casting it, the caster released an inaudible explosion of force. This explosion had a radius of 40 feet (12 meters) and severely hurt creatures that had [[:Category:Creatures with the earth subtype|elemental earth as part of its being]].As dangerous this spell was to these creatures, it was harmless to others.",
        "Components": "''Eradicate earth'' required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s. The material component took the form of a small stone. This stone was gripped and the gripping hand was thrust forward at the end of the casting. The stone disappeared and the explosion happened."
