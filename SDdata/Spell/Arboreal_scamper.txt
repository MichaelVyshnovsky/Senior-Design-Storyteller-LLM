Arboreal scamper was a divine magic spell granted to priests of Baervan Wildwanderer, the Forest Gnome. It allowed one or more creatures to climb, hang, and jump through the trees like a squirrel.
The caster had to touch the target(s) of this spell during casting. The duration for a single creature was three hours (longer for more experienced casters). Bestowing arboreal scamper on more creatures reduced the duration for each, divided equally, with a minimum of thirty minutes per target. The targets had to be human-sized or smaller (no scampering ogres, sorry) and have bare hands and feet with which to grip trees. The unencumbered movement rate was half that of a real squirrel, and encumbrance slowed a creature by half again. Jumping from limb to limb was a test of agility limited to , but even if a bespelled creature missed a branch, they could easily grab any other tree limb with which they came in contact, hopefully preventing a disastrous fall. Recipients of this spell could end its effects before they expired by uttering a certain command word.
This spell required verbal and somatic components plus the use of the priests holy symbol.
