Warp stone was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, this spell caused stone to become malleable and soft. It could be used to shape stone or collapse a stone wall. If the spell was cast on stone that was magically enchanted, there was a significant chance the spell would fail.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component a piece of clay, twisted during casting.
