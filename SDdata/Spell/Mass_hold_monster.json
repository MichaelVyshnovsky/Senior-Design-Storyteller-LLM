        "mainbody": "Mass hold monster was a spell used by sorcerers and wizards. It was a more powerful version of hold monster.\nThis spell functioned in the same manner as hold monster, except that it could be used against several creatures at once. The creatures had to be within  of each other.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, hard metal bar or rod, which could be as small as a three-penny nail. The spell also required a divine focus."
