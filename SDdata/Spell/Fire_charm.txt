Fire charm was an arcane wizard spell from the enchantment school that allowed the caster to transform a normal source of fire into a visual trap.
The spell caused a shimmering aura of color to envelop the fire, causing any who looked upon it to be charmed into remaining motionless and gaze into the fire for the spells duration.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required as a material component a thin piece of multi-colored silk to cast. The silk was tossed onto the fire and consumed during the casting.
Firewalkers, specialty priests devoted to Kossuth, used the fire charm spell.
