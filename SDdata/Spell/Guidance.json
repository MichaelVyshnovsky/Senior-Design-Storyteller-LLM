        "History": "Prior to the [[Spellplague]] and after the [[Second Sundering]], ''divine fortune'' was more commonly known as ''guidance'' and was slightly less powerful, being considered an [[orison]]. It could also only be cast a number of times per day equal to the number of times a cleric had prepared for its usage. There was also a similar [[evocation]] used by [[druid]]s.",
        "Intervention": "When people donated money to a church of [[deity]] and did something that had to do with that particular deity's portfolio, there was a chance, increasingly higher with increasing donation, that they benefited from a spontaneous ''guidance'' spell. ''[[Resistance]]'' and ''[[virtue]]'' were also one of those.{{Cite web\n| url            = http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/archfr/2002\n| title          = Donations and Interventions\n| accessdate     = 2017-25-03\n| date           = 2002-24-04\n| publisher      = Wizard of the Coast\n| archiveurl     = \n| archivedate    = \n}}"
