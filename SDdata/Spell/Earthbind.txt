Earthbind was a transmutation spell that temporarily suppressed a creatures ability to fly.
The spell enveloped a creature within a range of  in yellow strips of magical energy. If unable to resist, the affected creature could not fly again for up to 1 minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating.
If earthbind was cast on an airborne creature, it gently descended to the ground as if under the effect of a feather fall spell. Even if a newly applied effect would grant the creature the ability to fly again, it would be suppressed for the duration of the earthbind spell.
The spell required only verbal components, though some older versions of it required a somatic component.
* Gadacro had an innate ability to cast this spell once per day.
