        "mainbody": "Greater distraction was a common spell used by ninjas. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nNinja used this spell to distract a target. On casting, the ninja chose which sensation the target would be distracted by. The distractions were a physical sensation, such as itching. The sensation persisted until the target took the effort to relieve themselves of the distraction or until the spell expired. \nThe spell required only a somatic component, namely kuji-kiri hand gestures."
