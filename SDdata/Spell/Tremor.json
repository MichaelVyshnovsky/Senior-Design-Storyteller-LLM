        "mainbody": "Tremor was a destructive spell from the transmutation school of magic, used by some clerics, druids and and granted by Talos to his Stormlords.\nThe tremor spell was only limited by the casters eyesight. The spell was virtually instantaneous to cast, and once activated, it generated a localized tremor that wrenched the soil and ground within its area of effect. The ground was ripped and torn, while all those who were not quick enough â€“ were crushed and bludgeoned by rocks and soil. Those who received the spells full punishment also were knocked out for 18 seconds."
