        "mainbody": "Stone form was a spell used by clerics of Callarduran Smoothhands.\nWhen cast, the willing targeted creature was temporarily transformed into living stone, similar to a stone golem or stone guardian. The recipients defense abilities increased and they gained immunity to many mundane attacks, such as acid, fire and mundane weapons. The recipient did become vulnerable to spells that targeted stone, such as stone shape and transmute rock to mud.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Callarduran Smoothhands and a piece of rock from stone that was previously animated."
