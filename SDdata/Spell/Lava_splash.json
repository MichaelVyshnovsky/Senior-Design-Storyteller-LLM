        "mainbody": "Lava splash was a divine conjuration spell that created a wave of lava.\nThe lava wave splashed over a designated area some 40 feet (12.2 meters) wide and 20 feet (6.1 meters) high. Creatures standing in the area were hurt by the scorching hot lava that poured over them. The more experienced the caster, the more damage the lava would deal to their opponents.\nAnyone wearing metal armor who was caught in the blast suffered damage as if they were affected by the spell heat metal.\nLava splash acted as a cure moderate wounds spell to firenewts.\nOne needed a fist-sized chunk of volcanic rock as a focus for the spell to be cast. It could not be cast unless there was natural lava within 90 (27.4 m) of the caster.\nThe lava splash spell was only used by firenewt clerics of Kossuth.\nCategoryConjuration spells\nCategoryAlteration spells\nCategoryKossuthan spells\nCategoryCleric spells\nCategoryDruid spells\nm6ot07c51lnarhzfpnumone17zhzblr"
