        "Effect": "This spell filled a fist-sized glass sphere with a ''[[continual light]]'' that the caster could mentally control, changing the brightness from nothing to full daylight. No concentration was required to maintain this spell, only to modify the brightness, and there was no limit to the number of globes a caster could control, either individually or simultaneously.\n\nThe caster had to touch the glass sphere in order to cast the spell, but thereafter he or she could mentally control it within a range of {{SI|10|yd|m}} per experience level of the caster. The globes could be placed, moved, or carried, but were as delicate as the glass from which they were made.\n\nIf the caster died, the globes continued to function at their last setting. Another caster able to cast 4th level spells could take ownership of a globe just by touching it.",
        "Components": "Verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell, as well as a globe of blown glass of the highest quality, and a spark.",

Several wizards, such as [[Arbane]], read ''Nchaser's Eiyromancia'' while it was in Luskan.  Some time later the tome was stolen and then wandered the realms.\n\nThis spell was found in the pamphlet ''[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]'' published in [[1359 DR]].",
