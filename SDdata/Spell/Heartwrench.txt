'''''Heartwrench''''' was a unique [[Sharran]] [[illusion]] [[spell]] from the fourth circle of magic, used in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
==Effects==
The ''heartwrench'' spell was cast as a reaction mere moments after the caster was attacked. It could only be cast if a person who had their heartform mapped by the member of Sharran clergy attacked the caster or one of the caster's allies within {{SI|60'|'"|long=yes}}. Once the spell was cast, the rebuked mapped person was blasted with a powerful psychic barrage. Targets whose minds were steeled had a chance to reduce the incoming damage. The effects of ''heartwrench'' could not be strengthened by a casting at a higher proficiency level.

==History==
This unique sell was known and was used by the Mother Superior of the [[House of Grief]], [[Viconia DeVir]], during the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}} when she was the cleric performing the heartform mapping of the temple's visitors.
