Heartwrench was a unique Sharran illusion spell from the fourth circle of magic, used in the late 15 century DR.
The heartwrench spell was cast as a reaction mere moments after the caster was attacked. It could only be cast if a person who had their heartform mapped by the member of Sharran clergy attacked the caster or one of the casters allies within . Once the spell was cast, the rebuked mapped person was blasted with a powerful psychic barrage. Targets whose minds were steeled had a chance to reduce the incoming damage. The effects of heartwrench could not be strengthened by a casting at a higher proficiency level.
This unique sell was known and was used by the Mother Superior of the House of Grief, Viconia DeVir, during the Absolute crisis of the  when she was the cleric performing the heartform mapping of the temples visitors.
