        "mainbody": "'''''Missing word''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] used by the [[church of Oghma|clergy]] of [[Oghma]] to beseech their deity for lost or obscured information.\n\nThis spell was held with some reverence by the Oghman clergy. Its overuse was looked upon poorly by the Lord of Knowledge.",
        "Effects": "This spell was used when by Oghman [[cleric]]s when encountered an illustration, inscription or other written document that was missing a significant portion. It could even be used to make whole an incomplete spell incantation.\n\nWhen this spell was cast, the cleric was surrounded by a purple-white aura. Either the spell succeeded, and the missing information was temporarily revealed, or it failed, and cleric merely received a brief vision.",
        "History": "The specifications of this spell could be revealed upon a surface by the Oghman [[relic]], the ''[[Key of Faith]]''.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast."
