        "mainbody": "Transposing lunge is a spell used by several swordmages, particularly those of the shielding style. When transposing lunge is cast it allows a swordmage to teleport a creature struck their weapon in melee combat to a nearby location. Shielding swordmages have the added capacity to teleport in such a way creatures who would normally beyond the reach of the spell, so long as they are also currently under the affect of the aegis of shielding spell. Transposing lunge can be recharged after a short rest of a few minutes, at which point it can be cast again.\nCategorySwordmage spells\njqj3y2gt5giulb0kp9h1lyj47qkc4om"
