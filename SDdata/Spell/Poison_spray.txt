Poison spray was a conjuration spell that created a cloud of poisonous gas. 
When cast, a small cloud of poisonous gas was created from the casters palm. This cloud enveloped a target creature. The spell was only effective as a short-range attack, as the target creature was required to be within 10 feet (3 meters) of the caster.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
