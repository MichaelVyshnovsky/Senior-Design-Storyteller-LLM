        "mainbody": "Stone metamorphosis was a transmutation spell that changed one type of stone into another.\nOn casting stone metamorphosis, the caster changed one type of touched stone into another, with the affected volume increasing with the casters skill. For example, one could turn crumblestone in the ground into granite to avoid the hazard it posed. However, there were some limitations. First, one could not become rich by means of this spell, because stone metamorphosis could merely change one stone in another whose monetary value did not change. Second, gems, both precious and semi-precious, were outside of this spells capacities.\nStone metamorphosis required somatic, verbal, and material components to cast. The required material components were a grain of talc and a chip of obsidian. Cast as a divine spell, stone metamorphosiss material components were substituted with a divine focus.\nA kind of magical staff called the staff of stone was developed some time before 1372 DR. The crafting of these staves required, among others, the casting of a stone metamorphosis spell."
