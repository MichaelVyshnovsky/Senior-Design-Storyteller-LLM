        "mainbody": "'''''Stone metamorphosis''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that changed one type of stone into another.",
        "Effects": "On casting ''stone metamorphosis'', the caster changed one type of touched stone into another, with the affected volume increasing with the caster's skill. For example, one could turn [[crumblestone]] in the ground into [[granite]] to avoid the hazard it posed. However, there were some limitations. First, one could not become rich by means of this spell, because ''stone metamorphosis'' could merely change one stone in another whose monetary value did not change. Second, [[gem]]s, both precious and semi-precious, were outside of this spell's capacities.",
        "Components": "''Stone metamorphosis'' required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s to cast. The required material components were a grain of talc and a chip of [[obsidian]]. Cast as a divine spell, ''stone metamorphosis's'' material components were substituted with a [[divine focus]].",
        "History": "A kind of [[magic]]al [[staff]] called the ''[[staff of stone]]'' was developed some time before [[1372 DR]]. The crafting of these staves required, among others, the casting of a ''stone metamorphosis'' spell."
