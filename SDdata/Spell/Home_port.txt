Home port was a divine invocation spell used by specialty priests devoted to Valkur, allowing the recipient to sail home.
This spell allowed the recipient to unerringly sail to their home port regardless of how far away they were or inclement weather conditions. The home port was whichever port the ship docked at the most. The spell lasted for several weeks once cast.
In addition to verbal components and somatic components, this spell required as material components a pebble from the vessels native port to cast. The pebble was held during the casting.
