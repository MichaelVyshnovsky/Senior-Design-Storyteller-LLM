}}'''''Hellfire Storm''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]].

==Effects==
By casting ''hellfire storm'', the caster caused an explosion similar to that caused by the ''[[hellfire]]'' spell. The difference was that it was more devastating, had a longer range, and the explosion had double the radius of the ''hellfire'' spell. This fire bypassed every kind of [[magic]]al and other defenses against fire.

==Components==
''Hellfire storm'' required only verbal and somatic components.

==History==
''Hellfire storm'' was a spell that was only available to people who had access to the [[Diabolic domain]].
