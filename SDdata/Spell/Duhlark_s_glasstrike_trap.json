        "mainbody": "'''''Duhlark's glasstrike trap''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that was a variation of [[Duhlark's glasstrike]] cast upon glass surface.",
        "Effects": "This spell created a magical trap when cast upon a glass surface. Once cast the trap remained active for several days depending on the skill of the caster. The ''glasstrike tap'' would trigger when a creature came within {{SI|2|ft}} of the glass surface, activating the ''glasstrike'' spell. The caster could chose specific parameters that would trigger the trap. For example, the trap could be set to trigger only when touched by a [[humanoid]] to avoid being accidentally set off by wildlife such as [[squirrel]]s.\n\nThe ''glasstrike trap'' could be counted by ''[[Duhlark's glassremove]]''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s some [[sand]] or a small piece of glass to cast.",
        "History": "This spell was developed by [[Duhlark Kolat]], a powerful [[mage]] from [[Waterdeep]]."
