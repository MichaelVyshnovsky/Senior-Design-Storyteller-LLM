        "mainbody": "Duhlarks glasstrike trap was an arcane alteration spell that was a variation of Duhlarks glasstrike cast upon glass surface.\nThis spell created a magical trap when cast upon a glass surface. Once cast the trap remained active for several days depending on the skill of the caster. The glasstrike tap would trigger when a creature came within  of the glass surface, activating the glasstrike spell. The caster could chose specific parameters that would trigger the trap. For example, the trap could be set to trigger only when touched by a humanoid to avoid being accidentally set off by wildlife such as squirrels.\nThe glasstrike trap could be counted by Duhlarks glassremove.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components some sand or a small piece of glass to cast.\nThis spell was developed by Duhlark Kolat, a powerful mage from Waterdeep."
