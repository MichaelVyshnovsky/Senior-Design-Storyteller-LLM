        "mainbody": "'''''Bugman's mug''''' was a spell developed by [[Bugman]] to combat hangovers.",
        "Effects": "The spell converted the water inside a [[pewter]] [[mug]] into a [[potion]] that suppressed hangovers, drunkenness, and most other alcohol-related impairments if imbibed within the duration. The duration was dependent on the caster's experience: it would almost certainly last two minutes at least.",
        "Components": "Besides [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, the potion required common water as the [[material component]], served in a pewter mug.",
        "History": "The spell was developed by [[Bugman]] for a [[dwarven]] friend of his. It was a rare spell, barely known outside of hedge mages."
