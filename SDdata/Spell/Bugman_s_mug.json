        "mainbody": "Bugmans mug was a spell developed by Bugman to combat hangovers.\nThe spell converted the water inside a pewter mug into a potion that suppressed hangovers, drunkenness, and most other alcohol-related impairments if imbibed within the duration. The duration was dependent on the casters experience it would almost certainly last two minutes at least.\nBesides verbal and somatic components, the potion required common water as the material component, served in a pewter mug.\nThe spell was developed by Bugman for a dwarven friend of his. It was a rare spell, barely known outside of hedge mages."
