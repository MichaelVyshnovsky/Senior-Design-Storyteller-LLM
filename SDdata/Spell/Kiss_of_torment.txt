Kiss of torment was a divine necromancy spell used by priests devoted to Loviatar, enabling them to attack a targets nervous system with a touch.
This spell allowed the caster to attack a targets nervous system by touching their skin, overwhelming them with phantom pain that caused a great deal of physical harm and caused them to convulse uncontrollably.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
