Shatter circle was a divine abjuration spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Thoth called Scriveners.
This spell was originally developed as a response to the Red Wizards circle spells. As such it only functioned when a circle spell was active.
This spell targeted the Red Wizard who was the focus of their circle, shattering the circle and causing the Red Wizard to loose any spells gained from the circle.
Though not designed for it, shatter circle was also effective against spellmelds used by the Wychlaran of Rashemen, preventing the transference of spells between witches.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a crushed ruby worth at least 500 gp to cast.
