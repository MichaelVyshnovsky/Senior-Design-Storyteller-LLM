Wall against noise was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell created a wall of air that prevented sound from passing through. The wall blocked any sound-based attacks, such as a harpys cry or a banshees wail.
This spell required a white feather to cast.
Some ancient tales in Zakhara spoke of great cities ruled by marids that used walls against noise to protect their citadels against auditory-based magical items, such as drums of panic and horns of blasting.
