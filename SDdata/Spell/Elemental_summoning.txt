Elemental summoning was a powerful spell used by clerics, druids and shamans.
When cast, this spell summoned an elemental randomly from either the Elemental Plane of Air, Earth or Fire. The summoned elemental obeyed the caster but only remained on the casters plane for about ten minutes before returning to their home plane. There was a very slight chance this spell could accidentally summon one of the Elemental Princes.
