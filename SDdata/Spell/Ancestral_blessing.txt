'''''Ancestral blessing''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell called upon the ancestral [[spirit]]s of the caster. The caster used this spell to seek advice or protection. The summoned spirit answered one question or bestowed a single blessing. The caster could also ask the spirit to guard a location. If granted, the spirit acted as an alarm, warning the caster against non-magical intrusions. The spirit guarded the location for up to one month and did not aid in the defense of said location.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s, a thimble and one dozen grains from any cereal crop.
