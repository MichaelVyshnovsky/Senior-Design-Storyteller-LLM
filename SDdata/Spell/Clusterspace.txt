'''Clusterspace''', also known as the '''Astromundi Cluster''', was a remote and extremely ancient [[crystal sphere]],

==Description==
Unlike other crystal spheres, the crystal shell of Clusterspace was easily traversable from the [[phlogiston]], but it was immune to any attempt at breaching it from the inside. The only devices that could freely exit the Astromundi Cluster were living [[spelljammer]]s, such as those of [[elf|elven]] design.

==Location==
Clusterspace had connections in the [[Phlogiston|Flow]] to [[Krynnspace]], [[Greyspace]], and [[Realmspace]].
