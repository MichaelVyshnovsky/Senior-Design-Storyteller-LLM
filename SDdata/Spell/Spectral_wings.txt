Spectral wings was an arcane evocation spell that created a flying steed.
This spell created a magical force in the shape of a pair of wings that seemed to be made out of fog. The shape of the wings was determined by the material component of the spell (see below). The wings were 12 ft (3.7 m) long with a 2 ft (61 cm) platform between them, giving an overall wingspan of 26 ft (7.9 m). The wings were controlled by the thoughts of the caster as long he or she maintained contact. If the caster lost contact, cast another spell, launched a missile, was rendered unconscious, or killed, spectral wings continued to perform the last command they were given until the spell expired or the caster retook control, whichever came first. The wings lasted for 10 minutes per level of the caster and could not be harmed by normal weapons, but could be dispelled.
Spectral wings were intangible to those not riding on them, and they could pass through solid objects, but they felt solid to the pilot and any cargo or passengers. This spell did not make the cargo or passengers insubstantial, however. The wings were as maneuverable as the most agile winged creatures, but not extremely fast. Thus, a wizard could use them to fly along the narrow, twisting streets of a metropolis, for example. The steed could carry up to 100 lb (45 kg) per level of the caster. Any persons or cargo that caused this limit to be exceeded immediately fell through the substance of the wings.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a wing bone from any type of flying creature. The spell created a giant pair of wings that resembled that particular creatures wings in life.
This spell was published in "Volos Guide to All Things Magical" and became generally known to the magical community.
