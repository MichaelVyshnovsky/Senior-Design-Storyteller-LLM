'''''Shard blessing aura''''' was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]].
It was linked to the [[goddess]] [[Selûne]] and named for her [[planetar]] servants, called the [[Shards]].

==Users==
It was available to [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s of moderate power.

==Effects==
For a minute or more, the mage was surrounded by a shimmering light of blue-white hue rather like moonlight. It extended to a diameter of roughly 5 feet (1.5 meters) and went with them if they moved. As well as providing illumination comparable to a candle, it gave the caster all the benefits of a ''[[lesser globe of invulnerability]]''.

Moreover, if the mage was a sorcerer and worshiped Selûne, they also received the effect of a ''[[protection from evil]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, its [[material component]] was a [[moonstone]] or a polished white stone of another kind.
