        "mainbody": "'''''Pain''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "A wu jen used this spell to inflict intense agonizing pain on a creature. Multiple creatures could be targeted, as long as they were within 20 feet (6 meters) of each other. The pain subsided instantly, but targeted creatures were left with contorted muscles and in a weakened state. ''[[Prestidigitation]]'' or ''[[Bull's strength|strength]]'' cancelled the effects of this spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s, a leech and stone rubbed against a piece of slate."
