Gemidans icicle was an evocation spell that functioned as a variant of Snillocs snowball.
When cast, this spell created a ice-blue bolt that streaked forth towards a target person or creature. When it struck, a inch-thick (2.5 cm) patch of ice formed in a 3 (0.9 m) radius centered upon the point of collision. This effect had the potential of temporarily freezing an opponents hands or blinding their eyes.
When cast by more experienced mages, the spell had a greater effective range.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, icicle required a small piece of ivory or a chuck of ice to be cast.
This spell was developed by the wizard Gemidan, who served as apprentice to the original Blackstaff, Khelben Arunsun during the 14 century DR. As of the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, it was known by a select few individuals, namely Gemidan, Khelben and Laeral Silverhand.
