        "mainbody": "Spectral manticore was an illusion spell that created a spectral manticore which accompanied and fought alongside the caster for a limited time.\nThe spectral manticore resembled the magical beast in nearly every way, except that it was translucent in appearance. It possessed the lion-like body, humanoid head, spiked tail, and leathery wings of a corporeal manticore. This creature was unfailingly loyal to the casting cleric, was immune to charming effects, and was completely silent.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a spike taken from a real manticores tail.\nThe specifications of spectral manticore were taken from the Malarite relic, the Book of Fangs and Talons."
