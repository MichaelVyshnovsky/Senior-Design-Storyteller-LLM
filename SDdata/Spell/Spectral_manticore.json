        "mainbody": "'''''Spectral manticore''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that created a spectral [[manticore]] which accompanied and fought alongside the caster for a limited time.",
        "Effects": "The ''spectral manticore'' resembled the [[magical beast]] in nearly every way, except that it was translucent in appearance. It possessed the [[lion]]-like body, [[humanoid]] head, spiked tail, and leathery wings of a corporeal manticore. This creature was unfailingly loyal to the casting [[cleric]], was immune to ''[[charm]]ing'' effects, and was completely silent.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a spike taken from a real manticore's tail.",
        "History": "The specifications of ''spectral manticore'' were taken from the [[Malar]]ite [[relic]], the ''[[Book of Fangs and Talons]]''."
