        "mainbody": "Temporal shell was a powerful chronomancy spell that duplicated an innate power of royal time dimensionals to create a timeless bubble around the caster.)\nThis spell created an immovable shell with a  radius around the caster, protecting from the effects of time outside the shell. That is, within the time shell, the caster could function in time, while outside the bubble, time had effectively stopped. For the temporal shell spell, time stopped flowing everywhere except for within the area of effect.) Anyone within the temporal shell with the caster was also able to move in time. Anyone leaving the shell would immediately stop moving in time, except for the caster, whose departure would instantly dispel the shell and its effects.\nThe spell took one minute to cast and lasted at least a couple hours (relative to the casters flow of time within the bubble.)\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and material components, the latter being a complex and expensive device that required advanced preparation. A diamond valued at at least 5,000 gold pieces had to first be enchanted with a temporal stasis spell. The diamond must then be placed within a crystal ball of at least 1,000 gold pieces in value. Finally, the encapsulated diamond had to be physically touched by a time elemental while in the Demiplane of Time. Casting of the spell fully consumed the prepared diamond and its crystal globe."
