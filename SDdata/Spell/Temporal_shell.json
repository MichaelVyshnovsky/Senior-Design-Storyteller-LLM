        "mainbody": "'''''Temporal shell''''' was a powerful [[chronomancy]] spell that duplicated an innate power of royal [[time dimensional]]s to create a timeless bubble around the caster.)",
        "Effects": "This spell created an immovable shell with a {{SIAdj|5|ft|long=yes}} radius around the caster, protecting from the effects of time outside the shell. That is, within the time shell, the caster could function in time, while outside the bubble, time had effectively stopped. For the ''temporal shell'' spell, time stopped flowing everywhere ''except'' for within the area of effect.) Anyone within the temporal shell with the caster was also able to move in time. Anyone leaving the shell would immediately stop moving in time, except for the caster, whose departure would instantly dispel the shell and its effects.\n\nThe spell took one minute to cast and lasted at least a couple hours (relative to the caster's flow of time within the bubble.)",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s, the latter being a complex and expensive device that required advanced preparation. A [[diamond]] valued at at least 5,000 [[gold piece]]s had to first be enchanted with a ''[[temporal stasis]]'' spell. The diamond must then be placed within a [[crystal ball]] of at least 1,000 gold pieces in value. Finally, the encapsulated diamond had to be physically touched by a time elemental while in the [[Demiplane of Time]]. Casting of the spell fully consumed the prepared diamond and its crystal globe."
