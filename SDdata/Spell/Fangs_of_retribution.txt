Fangs of retribution was a divine evocation spell that dealt back all the injuries the caster had suffered.
The spell created the ghostly jaws and fangs of a viper in front of the casters face, who could then direct it to fly at and bite a foe of their choice. This bite dealt back all the injuries the caster had suffered from their chosen foe that day if the targeted creature had not harmed the caster that day, then the fangs had no effect.
It functioned similarly to the Ilmaters fist spell.
The spell required the fang of any type of snake, venomous or not.
The fangs of retribution spell appeared within the Tome of Torment, the holiest book of the church of Ilmater, which first appeared in the Realms in 848 DR.
