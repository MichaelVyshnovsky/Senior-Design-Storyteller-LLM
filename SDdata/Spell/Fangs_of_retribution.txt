'''''Fangs of retribution''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] spell that dealt back all the injuries the caster had suffered.

==Effect==
The spell created the ghostly jaws and fangs of a [[viper]] in front of the caster's face, who could then direct it to fly at and bite a foe of their choice. This bite dealt back all the injuries the caster had suffered from their chosen foe that day; if the targeted creature had not harmed the caster that day, then the ''fangs'' had no effect.

It functioned similarly to the ''[[Ilmater's fist]]'' spell.

==Components==
The spell required the fang of any type of [[snake]], venomous or not.

==History==
The ''fangs of retribution'' spell appeared within the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', the holiest book of the [[church of Ilmater]], which first appeared in the Realms in [[848 DR]].
