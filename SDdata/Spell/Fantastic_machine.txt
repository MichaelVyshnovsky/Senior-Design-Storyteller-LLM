'''''Fantastic machine''''' was a [[divine]] [[illusion]] [[spell]] that created an illusory and very noisy mechanical contraption.
This spell was attributed to [[Gond]].

==Users==
It was solely available to [[cleric]]s who worshiped deities of the [[craft domain|Craft]] or [[Gnome domain]]s.

==Effect==
When cast, this spell brought into being a large mechanical [[construct]]. It was illusory but very noisy and had an imposing and massive build and many arms. It had a hard, armored casing but was not especially resilient. It trundled along the ground at a pace one-third faster than a [[human]]. It was capable of swimming or flying, but did so slowly and clumsily.

It could be commanded by the spellcaster to carry out and repeat a simple, physical task, but instructions could be no more than twenty-five words in length. Instructions were given only when the spell was cast and could not be changed.

It could carry up to {{SI|700|lb|k|long=yes}}, but moved slowly when fully loaded, and it could not fly or swim if carrying over {{SI|230|lb|k|long=yes}}. It could lift a weight of up to {{SI|1400|lb|k|long=yes}} to a height of {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} and push or drag {{SI|3500|lb|k|long=yes}}. The ''fantastic machine'' could also excavate a volume of loose rock up to {{SI|7000|lb|k|long=yes}} per minute; [[sand]] or loose soil could be moved twice as fast.

The machine attacked by slamming one of its arms against an opponent; it was thrice as effective against metal or stone as it was against creatures and other materials. It could throw rocks or similar masses of a certain size up to a {{SI|150|ft|long=yes}} with ease, and up to {{SI|1500|ft|long=yes}} in total.
