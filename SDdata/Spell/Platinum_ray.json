        "mainbody": "Platinum ray was a spell used against evil dragons. \nWhen cast, a radiant platinum ray, representing the strength of good dragons, shot out from the caster to a target. When used against an evil dragon, the spell suppressed their innate magical abilities. \nThis spell required verbal and somatic components. Clerics of Bahamut were capable of casting this spell at a stronger level."
