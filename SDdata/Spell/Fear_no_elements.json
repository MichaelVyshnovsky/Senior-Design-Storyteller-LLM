When ''fear no elements'' was cast, it [[transmutation|transmuted]] its caster's body, making him or her less vulnerable to either acidic, electricity, fiery, freezing, or sonic attacks, to a degree dependent upon the swordmage's natural vitality. ''Fear no elements'' was a difficult spell to cast for its relative ease in learning and could only be cast once per day.",
