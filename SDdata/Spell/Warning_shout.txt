'''''Warning shout''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell given to priests of [[Arvoreen]], the Vigilant Guardian. It allowed the caster to yell a single word that could be heard at a great distance.

==Effects==
This spell magically amplified the caster's voice in such a way that the ''shout'' could be heard about {{SI|0.5|mi|k|long=yes}} away and was the same volume over the entire range of the spell. That is, the ''shout'' was not deafening up close and faint at the edge of the half-mile circle. The spell was instantaneous and allowed only one word to be projected. Creatures that were asleep and susceptible to being awakened by such a noise were automatically awakened by this spell, but knowledge about the cause of their arousal depended on each individual's perception and alertness.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
