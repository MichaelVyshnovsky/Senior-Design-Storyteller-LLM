Warning shout was a divine magic spell given to priests of Arvoreen, the Vigilant Guardian. It allowed the caster to yell a single word that could be heard at a great distance.
This spell magically amplified the casters voice in such a way that the shout could be heard about  away and was the same volume over the entire range of the spell. That is, the shout was not deafening up close and faint at the edge of the half-mile circle. The spell was instantaneous and allowed only one word to be projected. Creatures that were asleep and susceptible to being awakened by such a noise were automatically awakened by this spell, but knowledge about the cause of their arousal depended on each individuals perception and alertness.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
