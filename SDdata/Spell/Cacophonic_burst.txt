When the spell was cast, it created a bubble of  in a radius filled with low, discordant noise. It dealt sonic damage to all things within the spells radius of effect. It could be cast as far as  away from the caster, and its power and distance increased with the spellcasters magical prowess. Areas under the effects of a silence spell were unaffected by cacophonic bursts.
