Spirit armor was an uncommon necromancy spell that surrounded the caster with a portion of their own life force, which acted as magical armor.
The necromancy spell took the form of a shimmering aura, which protected against magical and physical attacks. Specifically, the magical armor acted the same as splint mail, but was not cumulative with other types of protection. However, the spirit armor did not slow movement or encumber the caster, unlike regular armor.
When the spell ended, the magical aura ceased to exist, and the caster had a chance to lose a portion of their life.
The spell only required verbal and somatic components.
