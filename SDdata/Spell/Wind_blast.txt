'''''Wind blast''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell given to priests of [[Aerdrie Faenya]]. It created a powerful gust of wind that struck all in the area of effect with blunt force.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a single burst of wind in a cone shape emanating from the caster's outstretched hand. The minimum cone was 25 ft (7.6 m) long and 5 ft (1.5 m) wide at the base. Higher level casters could extend this out to a maximum of 50 ft (15 m) with a diameter of 10 ft (3 m). [[Human]]-sized creatures and larger caught in the cone were struck as if by a blunt weapon. Smaller creatures were also struck and had to resist being thrown backward up to 25 ft (7.6 m). If they failed to resist, and collided with a solid, immovable object, they could suffer additional damage and be stunned for a few minutes.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small [[paper]] fan (which was consumed in the casting) and the priest's [[holy symbol]].
