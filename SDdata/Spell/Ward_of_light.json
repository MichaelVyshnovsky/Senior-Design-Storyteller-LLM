        "mainbody": "'''''Ward of light''''' was a multi-[[school of magic|school]] [[divine]] spell that created an protective force field around the caster.",
        "Effects": "When this spell was cast, the [[cleric]] was surrounded by a stationary field of force energy, that was spherical or hemi-spherical in shape. It had a diameter anywhere from {{SIrange|10|90|ft|long=yes}} in length.\n\nWhenever hostile beings entered the area of effect, the ''ward of light'' shot a ray of energy at them from the spell's [[material component]]s, which sat in its center. The ''ward'' considered anyone not carrying a [[holy symbol]] of [[Lathander]] as hostile. These rays were exceptionally harmful to the [[undead]].",
        "History": "This spell was inscribed within the holy [[relic]] called the ''[[Tome of the Morning]]''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required six tokens made of [[ivory]], inscribed with the symbol of Lathander."
