        "mainbody": "Ward of light was a multi-school divine spell that created an protective force field around the caster.\nWhen this spell was cast, the cleric was surrounded by a stationary field of force energy, that was spherical or hemi-spherical in shape. It had a diameter anywhere from  in length.\nWhenever hostile beings entered the area of effect, the ward of light shot a ray of energy at them from the spells material components, which sat in its center. The ward considered anyone not carrying a holy symbol of Lathander as hostile. These rays were exceptionally harmful to the undead.\nThis spell was inscribed within the holy relic called the Tome of the Morning.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required six tokens made of ivory, inscribed with the symbol of Lathander."
