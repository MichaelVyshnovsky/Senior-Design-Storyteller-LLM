Alicorn lance was an evocation spell in which the priest could fire a unicorns horn, called an alicorn, at a foe. It was granted by Lurue, the Unicorn Queen.
The spell created a silver, ethereal alicorn that floated above the brow of the caster. The caster had to fire the "lance" at a creature within , before the spell ended, or the alicorn would be wasted. If the spell hit, it inflicted fair piercing damage, but dissipated if it missed. After hitting a creature, it would be limned in faerie fire of a silver hue, applying combat penalties to said opponent.
As well as verbal and somatic components, either a divine focus, or a lock of a unicorns mane and the priests holy symbol were required.
