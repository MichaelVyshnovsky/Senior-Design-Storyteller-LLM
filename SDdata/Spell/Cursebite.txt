Cursebite was a necrotic invocation used by warlocks, particularly those of the dark pact.
Cursebite took advantage of a warlocks ability to curse their foes and each creature so cursed within an area of fifty feet in radius could become affected with cursebite, which struck deep into their life force. Though cursebite relied primarily on a warlocks charisma for power, dark pact warlocks with a high enough intellect could cast cursebite with even greater lethality. 
Cursebite was a somewhat complex spell, and requires its caster to rest briefly before casting it again.
