        "mainbody": "'''''Fireball''''' was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] that created a tiny ball of fire that, when thrown, exploded in a huge fireball. While a very potent spell, casters had to take care to avoid catching allies in the explosion, or to accidentally strike an obstruction and detonate the spell early.\n\n{{quote|''Fireball. These underways and cells are too small for fireballs, especially the augmented one you'll cast, [[Trandon]]. It backfires on you, burning you and [[Artemis Entreri|Entreri]] to piles of ash. You really must be more careful.''|[[Khelben Arunsun]]}}",
        "Effects": "Before the [[Spellplague]], ''fireball'' at its weakest had a range of over 400 ft (120 m),, but after the collapse of the [[Weave]] its range was greatly reduced, only reaching 100 ft (30 m). After the [[Second Sundering]], the spell's range was 150 ft (46 m).\n\nIf cast in [[Wildspace|space]], the spell itself could pass through the void, but the fireball could only be detonated inside an atmosphere. If cast in the [[phlogiston]], the spell immediately detonated at the caster's position. ''Fireball'' was capable of dealing damage to [[spelljammer]]s.",
        "Components": "In the [[Raumviran]] spellcasting tradition, the verbal component was the word ''Kelenta''.\n\nMany versions had [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components but also the need for a tiny amount of [[bat]] [[guano]] or [[sulphur]].{{cite web|url= https://x.com/TheEdVerse/status/1817417112031318523|title=Ed's Status|accessdate=2024-11-01 |author= Ed Greenwood|date= 28|year= 2024|month= July|format= Tweet||language= English}} However, most wizards, upon learning how to cast ''fireball'' would spend at least a [[Tenday|tenday]] modifying the spell to make it easier to cast quickly.{{cite web|url= https://x.com/TheEdVerse/status/1817375064389476576|title=Ed's Status|accessdate=2024-11-01 |author= Ed Greenwood|date= 28|year= 2024|month= July|format= Tweet||language= English}}",
        "History": "This spell was developed by the Fire Warden of [[Netheril]] [[Noanar]] and was named '''''Noanar's fireball''''' in {{Yearlink|-2303}}, two years after its more powerful companion ''[[delayed blast fireball]]''. It was the [[arcanist]]'s last invention, three years before his death at the hands of his long-time enemies and victims, the [[Canlespiere]] [[ogre]]s.<ref>\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-478}}, [[Olostin]], the low Netherese Baron of Dread, and his company were incinerated by a ''Noanar's fireball'' cast at extremely high level by an unknown arcanist, ending his reign of terror.<ref> \n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], the wizard [[Dwalimar Omen]] attempted to cast the spell, but only managed to produce flowers.<ref>{{Cite comic/Picking up the Pieces}}\n\nIn [[Waterdeep]] in 1358 DR, [[Kyriani]] placed a ''fireball'' spell in a ''[[ring of spell storing]]'', which [[Onyx the Invincible]] used to surprise the marauding [[Aviss]] and [[Fellandar]], though they emerged smoking from the flames.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City|19}}",
        "Variations": "There existed a variation of the ''fireball'' spell called ''orb of black death''. The difference between the two spells is that the ''orb of black death'' was imbued with [[necrotic energy]] rather than fire and flame."
