        "mainbody": "'''''Shadow hand''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that would conjure a translucent, billowy hand that obeyed the will of the caster.",
        "Effects": "The shadowy hand had to stay within a number of yards of the caster, depending on their level. \n\n''Shadow hand'' was capable of providing cover, much like ''[[Bigby's interposing hand]]'', as well as capable of carrying materials, much like ''[[Tenser's floating disk]]''.\n\nIt had no effect on the [[undead]], [[golem]]s, [[construct]]s, creatures from the [[outer planes]], and primitive non-vertebrates (such as [[ooze]]s, [[slime]]s, and non-intelligent plants).",
        "History": "This spell was created by the wizard named [[Jume]] several hundred years before the [[Time of Troubles]] and recorded in her personal [[spellbook]], the [[Arcanabula of Jume]]."
