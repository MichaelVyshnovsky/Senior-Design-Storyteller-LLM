Spice was a useful cantrip that initiate wizards could learn. It conjured a sprinkling of a particular spice or herb above a target creature or object.
This cantrip conjured a small quantity of a spice known to the caster. It appeared just above the target and fell as a fine powder or small flakes. The amount was typically enough to treat food or drink for about six people.The original description of this cantrip in Dragon #59 put this at a dozen people. It was changed to "half-dozen" in Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four. The target of this spell had to be within  of the caster.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster hummed a little tune while pretending to crumble and sprinkle a substance with one hand.
