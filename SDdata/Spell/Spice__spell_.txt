'''''Spice''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that initiate [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It conjured a sprinkling of a particular [[:Category:Spices|spice]] or herb above a target creature or object.

==Effects==
This cantrip conjured a small quantity of a spice known to the caster. It appeared just above the target and fell as a fine powder or small flakes. The amount was typically enough to treat food or drink for about six people.The original description of this cantrip in [[Dragon magazine 59|''Dragon'' #59]] put this at a dozen people. It was changed to "half-dozen" in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. The target of this spell had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster hummed a little tune while pretending to crumble and sprinkle a substance with one hand.
