'''''Speed''''' was a type of [[giant]] rune.

==Effects==
When a creature wore footwear inscribed with this rune, they were capable of moving at far greater speeds. If this rune was extensively studied a second time, then this effect would be even greater.

==Components==
Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune ''[[Healing (rune)|healing]]''. The process of shaping this rune generally took around ten to forty minutes and it needed to be inscribed upon a set of any kind footwear. Even [[horseshoe]]s were known to work for this purpose.
