Dark embrace was a spell used by priests of Vhaeraun to store a spell for rapid use at a later time.
On casting, a dark mask was created around the face, in which a second spell could be stored. This stored spell could be rapidly unleashed, either on the caster or on another person. In the latter case, the mask placed itself on the target, who was then subject to the spell.
The mask created by dark embrace could be used as a substitute for a holy symbol.
This spell required only verbal components to cast.
A darkmask who had reached a sufficient level of skill could also use dark embrace, though their version was used for rapid casting and transfer of spells.
