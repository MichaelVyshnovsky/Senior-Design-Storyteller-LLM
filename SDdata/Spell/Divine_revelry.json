        "mainbody": "'''''Divine revelry''''', also known as '''''Galerian revelry''''', was [[mage]] [[spell]] created and used by [[Gale Dekarios]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Effect": "When cast, ''divine revelry'' conjured forth a [[barrel]] of [[firewine]] or [[Shadowdark ale]] from the [[Yawning Portal]] tavern of [[Waterdeep]] that materialized within {{SI|40|feet|long=yes}} from the caster. Additionally to the alcohol, the spell affected all creatures within {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} of the barrel in a similar way to the ''[[Otto's irresistible dance]]'' spell, forcing them to revel, shuffle, and dance ecstatically. If the affected creatures failed to resist the magic's compulsion, they were rendered unable to to move or do anything else and were vulnerable to all attacks."
