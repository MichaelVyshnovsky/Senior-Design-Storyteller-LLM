        "mainbody": "'''Blessed watchfulness''' was an [[alteration]] spell that bestowed extraordinary powers of vigilance on a creature. It was one of the first spells that priests of both [[Arvoreen]] and [[Gorm Gulthyn]] learned.",
        "Effects": "This spell lasted a minimum of five hours (longer for more experienced casters) and granted the recipient alertness to their surroundings for the duration. Benefits included a greater resistance to ''[[rod of beguiling|beguiling]]'', ''[[charm]]'', ''[[emotion]]'', ''[[fear]]'', and especially ''[[sleep]]'' spells and effects. The target of this spell remained awake and vigilant, making them very difficult to surprise.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast, including touching the recipient of the spell."
