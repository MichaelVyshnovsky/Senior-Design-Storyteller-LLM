Charm of Isis was a divine abjuration spell used only by specialty priestesses devoted to Isis called Skyweavers.
This spell enchanted a small item to serve as a protective charm for several days. The charm only worked for the person selected by the caster when the spell was cast. Furthermore, the charm would only aid that person so long as their actions were favored by Isis and the charm was touching their skin.
The charm could be enspelled to make the target more difficult to strike during combat, or to provide a bit of resistance to spells, poisons, etc. A Skyweaver could only have three enchanted charms active at a time. The caster could only enchant a charm for herself if traveling beyond the borders of the Old Empires.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the priestesss holy symbol to cast.
