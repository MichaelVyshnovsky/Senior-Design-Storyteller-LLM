        "mainbody": "'''''Gate of doom''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Jergal]] called [[Doomscribe]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell summoned a wall of energy from the [[Negative Energy plane]] that also served as a portal to that realm. This shimmering black wall would harm any living creature that touched it and permanently lessen their level of expertise for all of their skills. Any creature passing through the ''gate of doom'' would arrive upon the Negative Energy plane and be abandoned as there was no return portal.\n\nOnce cast, the ''gate of doom'' could not be moved. Nor could it be cast directly on a living creature. Doing so would cause the gate to appear nearby in a random location. The ''[[negative plane protection]]'' spell prevented a creature from passing through the gate and any harm from befalling a creature if they touched the gate. [[Undead]] and creatures tied to the Negative Energy plane ignored this spell's effects.\n\nA ''gate of doom'' would double the effectiveness of any energy draining undead attacks, the ''[[energy drain]]'' spell, and ''[[enervation]]'' spell cast within {{SI|300|ft}} of the gate.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a small piece of black charcoal, a black [[gemstone]] worth at least 50 [[gp]], and the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast."
