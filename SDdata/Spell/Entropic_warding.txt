'''''Entropic warding''''' was a defensive [[warlock]] invocation designed to deflect ranged attacks and prevent them from being tracked by trail or scent.

==Effect==
The warlock was surrounded by swirling chaotic energies that deflected incoming projectiles, rays, thrown weapons, ''etc''., similar to the [[spell]] ''[[entropic shield]]''.

They also left no trail and could not be tracked via scent. They could, however, still be detected by scent.
