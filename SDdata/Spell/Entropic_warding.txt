Entropic warding was a defensive warlock invocation designed to deflect ranged attacks and prevent them from being tracked by trail or scent.
The warlock was surrounded by swirling chaotic energies that deflected incoming projectiles, rays, thrown weapons, etc., similar to the spell entropic shield.
They also left no trail and could not be tracked via scent. They could, however, still be detected by scent.
