'''''Tree steed''''' was an [[alteration]]/[[enchantment]] [[spell]] that changed a piece of wood into a walking beast of burden.

==Effects==
Upon casting this spell on a log or plank of specific dimensions (see below), it would grow four wooden, [[horse]]-like legs and become animated. This could then be ridden or used to carry gear and equipment. The eponymous ''tree steed'' remained animated on average for a period of four hours, though it could last longer for more experienced casters. If the steed broke for any reason, the enchantment would end. These steeds could not fight, only follow movement commands within their limitations. And since they were made out of wood, they had all the properties and vulnerabilities of normal wood.

The maximum load a ''tree steed'' could carry before breaking was {{SI|600|lb|k|long=yes}}. The ''tree steed'' would obey simple movement commands (forward, stop, speed up, slow down, turn, ''etc.'') and could move at a normal [[human]] walking pace on land or paddle on water at half that rate. However, the caster had to stay within {{SI|10|yards|long=yes}} of the ''steed'', otherwise it would stop and wait for the caster to come back within range.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a log or plank within the specified dimensions and a [[horseshoe]] as the [[material component]]s. The log or plank used needed to be at least {{SI|3|in|long=yes}} thick, {{SIAdj|1|ft|long=yes}} wide, and between {{SIrange|3|10|ft|long=yes}} in length.

==Notable Users==
[[Gondsman (class)|Gondsmen]], the [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Gond]], were capable of casting this spell.<ref>
