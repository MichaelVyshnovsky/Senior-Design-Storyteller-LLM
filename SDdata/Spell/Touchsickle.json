        "mainbody": "Touchsickle was a divine magic spell available to druids, specialty priests, and allies of Eldath, the Green Goddess. It transformed the casters hand into a magical sickle.\nSimilar to flame blade and ice blade, this spell caused one of the casters hands to become a magical weapon. For six minutes (longer for more experienced casters), the chosen hand was transformed into a magically sharp wooden sickle that, for comparison purposes, was equivalent to a +2 weapon. Touchsickle did not improve combat skill by any means, but the merest touch of this implement caused a wound identical to being slashed by a non-magical sickle.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.\nPeacemen and peacewomen of Eldath could only use this spell for non-aggressive purposes or self-defense. For druids, the touchsickle was equivalent to a golden or silver sickle for the purpose of harvesting mistletoe at its greatest potency."
