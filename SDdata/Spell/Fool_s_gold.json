        "Effects": "On casting ''fool's gold'', a certain volume of touched metal, 10 cubic inches (164 milliliters) at minimum, started to look like gold. The affected volume grew with the caster's skill. The minimum amount was about one hundred fifty coins and, provided that the coins were in touch with each other, they could be affected all at once by touching a single one. This illusion lasted for a long time measured in hours. Even people who examined these fakes could be fooled by this spell.",
        "Components": "Casting ''fool's gold'' required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s. The material component was a [[gem]] of at least 5 [[gp]] in monetary value. This gem was crushed to powder and sprinkled on the metal object that was to be turned into \"gold\".",
        "History": "This spell was the only creation of [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Purnia]], invented in [[-1694 DR|-1694 DR (2165 NY)]]. Consistently, it was known as '''''Purnia's fools' gold''''' in the age of Netheril."
