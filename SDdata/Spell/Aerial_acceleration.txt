'''''Aerial acceleration''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]], available to [[dragon]]s, that allowed it to increase the rate of speed by which a single creature, capable of flight, traveled through the air. It was often used by dragons to improve their own capabilities during aerial combat.

==Effects==
During the spell's duration, the affected creature was less-affected by air resistance and moved at a rate 50% faster than usual. While this enhanced speed was beneficial for dragons, when cast upon themselves, it often made them far less maneuverable. However, the effectiveness of ''aerial acceleration'' along with any detriments, depended heavily on a dragon's inherent skill in determining the effects of air currents and their knowledge of aerial flight patterns. Skilled aerial combatants may have seen little to no drop in their combat prowess while in flight.

The effects of the spell could not be ended at will; however they were readily ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' or otherwise stripped away.

==Components==
This spell required only a [[verbal component]].
