'''''Fumble''''', originally called '''''Berthot's blunder''''', was a common [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, creatures became clumsy within the spell's area of effect. Items and [[weapon]]s were dropped and a walking or running creature tripped and fell. Fallen creatures struggled to stand and picking up a fallen item or weapon became difficult. A caster could target a single creature as well.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a small amount of solidified fat from [[milk]].

==History==
The spell was invented by the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]], [[Berthot]], in {{Yearlink|-1149}}.
