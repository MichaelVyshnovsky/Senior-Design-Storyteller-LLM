Jhanifers deliquescence was a spell that affected the state of a liquid.
When cast, the spell functioned exactly like transmute rock to mud, except that it transformed ice into cold water, approximately . If the water was dispelled or affected by cold magic, it regained its icy form and refroze in a natural manner, depending on the surrounding temperature and conditions.
In addition to somatic and verbal, this spell required material components, a piece of both amber and ice.
This spell was developed by Anastra Sylun√© Silverhand, the "Witch of Shadowdale", while she traveled under the assumed name of "Jhanifer".
