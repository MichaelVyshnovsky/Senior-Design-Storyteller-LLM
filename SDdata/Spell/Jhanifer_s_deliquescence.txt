'''''Jhanifer's deliquescence''''' was a [[spell]] that affected the state of a liquid.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell functioned exactly like ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'', except that it transformed ice into cold water, approximately {{SI|40|F}}. If the water was ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' or affected by ''cold'' [[magic]], it regained its icy form and refroze in a natural manner, depending on the surrounding temperature and conditions.

==Components==
In addition to [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[Verbal component|verbal]], this spell required [[material component]]s, a piece of both [[amber]] and ice.

==History==
This spell was developed by [[Anastra Syluné Silverhand]], the "Witch of [[Shadowdale]]", while she traveled under the assumed name of "Jhanifer".
