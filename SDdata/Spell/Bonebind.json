        "Effects": "''Bonebind'' caused [[undead]] corporeal targets to curl up into a ball. If more than one undead target was affected then they would clump together tightly. The undead remained fixed as if held in stasis, unable to move or use any special abilities. They would remain held in this manner until either the spell ended or the caster willed it, leaving plenty of time for the caster to roll the ball of undead off a cliff or into a fire or other such action. A vile [[necromancer]] could also use this spell to collect their undead servants and dispatch them directly into the midst of their enemy.\n\nWhen used against stronger forms of corporeal undead, or any incorporeal undead, ''bonebind'' acted like a ''[[slow]]'' spell. This spell had no effect on living targets. ''Bonebind'' had several unique effects when used against specific types of undead. [[Vampires]] could be forced into corporeal form and trapped that way and unable to fly for the spell's duration. ''Bonebind'' prevented a [[banshee]] from wailing and negated any aging from being touched by a [[ghost]].",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a bone from any creature to cast.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was rumored that [[necromancer]]s on [[Radole]] had ringed that planet with a large minefield of ''boneballs'' composed of [[skeleton]]s in order to deter unexpected visitors."
