'''''Snakebite''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s.

==Effects==
This spell transformed one of the caster's arms into a slithering fanged snake. A bite from the caster's snake arm inflicted physical damage from the fangs and the venom had a chance of paralyzing the target for several minutes.

The caster was unable to perform any other actions with the snake arm, but could perform all of their normal activities with the other arm, including casting spells that required only [[somatic component|somatic]] components.

The caster could only be under the effect of a single ''snakebite'' spell at a time.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and somatic components to cast.
