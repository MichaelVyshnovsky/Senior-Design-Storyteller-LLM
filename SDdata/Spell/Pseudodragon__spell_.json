        "mainbody": "Pseudodragon was a spell that could only be cast by dragons.\nThis spell was similar to the monster summoning spells. A dragon used this spell to summon a number of pseudodragons. The summoned pseudodragons had the same scale color and alignment as the dragon who cast the spell. The pseudodragons displayed total loyalty to the dragon and obeyed its commands. A dragon used this spell to attack an enemy or to have the pseudodragons perform tasks.\nIf summon to perform tasks, the dragon had to give each pseudodragon a gem with a value of no less than 50 gp before the task was given. If the dragon refused. the pseudodragons instantly returned to where they were summoned from. If summoned to attack an enemy, the dragon had give the pseudodagons at least one body so they could feast upon it, as well as a gemstone. If the dragon consistently refused to pay or even kill the summoned pseudodragons, the spell eventually failed to summon any pseudodragons.\nThe spell required only a verbal component."
