        "mainbody": "Holy flail was a divine alteration and invocation spell used by priests devoted to Tempus, enabling them to turn their holy symbol into an enchanted flail.\nThis spell transformed the priests holy symbol, or any non-bladed weapon, into a magical flail. The magical force forming the flail crackled with energy, making it much easier to strike and harm the casters foes. The holy flail inflicted additional harm to foes of opposing moral stances to the caster with regards to good versus evil and law versus chaos.\nIf created from a holy symbol, the holy flail could only be wielded by priest of Tempus.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a pinch of powdered gemstone to cast."
