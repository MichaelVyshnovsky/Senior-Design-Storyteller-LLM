'''''Jest''''' was a common spell used by [[geisha]]. The spell was extremely rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
This spell was very similar to the ''[[fascinate]]'' spell. When a creature heard the geisha casting the spell, they ceased what they were doing and became transfixed. If a creature was attacked before the spell was cast, the effect was broken. After the spell was cast, a transfixed creature burst into uncontrollable and debilitating laughter. Some creatures were able to withstand the spell and were not affected.

==Components==
The spell required only a [[verbal component]].
