This spell was identical to the ''[[teleport]]'' spell, just more powerful. It allowed the caster to teleport up to twelve creatures or objects instantly between two points. Teleportation between two separate planes was not possible.

==Components==
After the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, this spell required only a [[verbal component]], but previously also required a [[somatic component]].
