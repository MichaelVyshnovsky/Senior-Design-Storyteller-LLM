Divine wind was a powerful spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
This spell allowed a shugenja to summon extremely powerful winds. The force of the wind was similar to that of a hurricane. It had the power to capsize ships, collapse wooden structures and topple trees. The winds had an effect on the terrain. If cast over a large body of water, large waves formed if cast in a dry area or desert, a sandstorm formed and if cast during winter or in an area with snow, a blizzard formed. If cast near a large fire, a firestorm formed. Creatures caught in the wind suffered damage, and risked drowning or being buried in blowing sand or snow.  The powerful winds greatly reduced movement and communication between creatures became difficult. Missiles and projectiles became impossible to use.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components. The shugenja required a holy symbol of their deity, a portable drum, and a flag or banner inscribed with the calligraphic character for wind.
