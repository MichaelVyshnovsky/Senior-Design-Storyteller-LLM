        "mainbody": "'''''Sashelan blessing''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[elves]]s of [[Myth Drannor]] and [[Semberholme]].",
        "Effects": "When cast on a targeted creature, they entered into a state of deep sleep. The spell granted the targeted creature the ability to breathe underwater, endure the pressures of the depths, and remain dry, along with any possessions held at the time of casting, until the spell expired.\n\nThe spell left a subtle coral-pink radiance upon the targeted creature, visible only within the upper {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} of water. Once submerged beyond that threshold, the color shifted , renderering the targeted creature invisible, detectable only through magic-detection spells.\n\n''Sashelan blessing'' could not be cast on individuals who already possessed active water-breathing magic or an innate ability within them. It was also unable to be cast on large creatures.\n\nSimilar to ''[[sleep]]'', the targeted creature's slumber could be interrupted by damage or loud noises. However, the ambient hum of the deep sea, the constant background noise of the ocean and its inhabitants, or non-damaging interactions, such as those with dolphins or similar creatures, were insufficient to break the spell. If the targeted creature was awakened, the water-breathing ability remained in effect for a very short time.",
        "Use": "In an ideal scenario, people would be aware of the spell's purpose and willingly submit to its effects, knowing that it spared them the potentially harrowing descent through the depths to the haven of [[Myth Nantar]]. Nowadays, the few elves and [[human]]s who were acquainted with the spell consider it a rescue enchantment for sailors who have fallen overboard, allowing them to endure until they ccould be brought ashore. Many sailors in the [[Inner Sea]] owed their lives to this spell, yet the slumber it induced often fosters skepticism among them regarding the existence of [[triton]]s, [[merfolk]], or sea elves in significant numbers.\n\n''Sashelan blessing'' was used by the [[Shipwreck and Salvagers' Guild]], headquartered in [[Marsember]]. Access to this spell was contingent upon guild membership and payment of dues, amounting to five percent of all salvaged treasures or a minimum of fifty [[gp]] per year. Unbeknownst to guild members, the guild's founder also shared this spell with various allies. Therefore, with some inquiries and a generous sum of [[gold]], spellcasters across the [[Dragon Coast]], [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], the [[Vast]], and [[Impiltur]] could be found who are capable of casting this spell or teaching it in exchange for a significantly higher fee.",
        "History": "Originating during the days of [[Aryselmalyr]] and the ascendance of [[Cormanthyr]], this spell was crafted with the purpose of fostering better relations between surface-dwelling elves and the [[sea elves]] of [[Ser√¥s]]. The spell enabled sea elves to immobilize struggling individuals at risk of drowning and granted them the means to survive the journey to safety, be it the shore or other sanctuaries.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s."
