        "mainbody": "Teleport object was an alteration spell that could instantly transport a small object across large distances.\nOne object weighing no more than a few ounces (a minimum of six for the most basic user, but the spell might as well work with one or two more) could be teleported by the caster to a location seen before on the same plane. There was a chance that the object arrived off target, just like with a teleport spell according to early sources, or up to  away from the designated point in any direction according to later sources. It never materialized within solid matter, however.\nIn contrast to the more powerful teleport object spell, also known as vanish, an item could not be transported to the Ethereal plane. Also, the spell did not work on undead creatures. According to some earlier sources, magical items, or those in the grasp of another, might require stronger spellcraft to transport at all.\nAside from verbal and somatic components, teleport object required a gemstone that was clear or transparent in uncut form and worth at least 25 gold pieces. The caster also had to touch the object as part of casting this spell.\nThis spell was frequently used by mages to exchange written messages, as pieces of paper presented no problem for its weight restriction."
