It was presumably developed by the mage [[Mordenkainen]].\n\nTo [[Zakhara]]n mages, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''faithful hound''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].",
        "History": "In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''Mordenkainen's faithful hound'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}"
