        "mainbody": "Sacred guardian was an enchantment spell that warned the caster whenever the target was in danger.\nThe caster had to touch the recipient of this spell for it to work. For days after this spell was cast, the priest would mystically become aware of any danger that was threatening the target creature. The spell lasted longer the higher the level of the caster and, with a little practice, the priest received a mental picture of the situation facing the recipient. However, no location information was conveyed by this spell only what the caster could infer from the mental image.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the caster had to touch the recipient and have a rose petal that had been kissed by the recipient.\n* Qaida, an aasimar and cleric of Arawn."
