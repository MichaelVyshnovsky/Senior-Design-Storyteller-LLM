        "mainbody": "'''''Death pact''''' was a powerful [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Velsharoon]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell resurrected a targeted creature if they were killed. The targeted creature had to enter into a binding agreement with Velsharoon for the spell to be successful. The spell acted as three spells in one. Upon death, the targeted creature was sent to a location determined by the caster during casting with a ''[[word of recall]]''. Following this, a ''[[raise dead]]'' spell resurrected the targeted creature. They were then healed with a ''[[heal]]'' spell. The spell was not cast often as it took five years off the life of the caster and took a week to prepare.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[divine focus]] and a [[material component]]: a [[diamond]] with a value of at least 500 [[gp]]."
