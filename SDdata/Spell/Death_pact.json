        "mainbody": "Death pact was a powerful spell used by clerics of Velsharoon.\nWhen cast, this spell resurrected a targeted creature if they were killed. The targeted creature had to enter into a binding agreement with Velsharoon for the spell to be successful. The spell acted as three spells in one. Upon death, the targeted creature was sent to a location determined by the caster during casting with a word of recall. Following this, a raise dead spell resurrected the targeted creature. They were then healed with a heal spell. The spell was not cast often as it took five years off the life of the caster and took a week to prepare.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a divine focus and a material component a diamond with a value of at least 500 gp."
