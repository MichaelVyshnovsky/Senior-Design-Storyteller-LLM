Detect crossroads was a simple spell used by bards and druids.
When cast, this spell allowed the caster to detect fey crossroads. It detected their location within  of the caster, if the crossroad was further away, the caster was able to determine its general direction. When a fey crossroad was detected, it appeared to the caster as a blue shadow shaped in a X. The spell prevented the caster from being tricked into using a fake crossroad. The spell did not provide information on what lies at the ends of the crossroads or where they lead. 
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
