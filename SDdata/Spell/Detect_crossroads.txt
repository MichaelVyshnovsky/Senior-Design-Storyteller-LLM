'''''Detect crossroads''''' was a simple [[spell]] used by [[bard]]s and [[druid]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell allowed the caster to detect [[fey crossroad]]s. It detected their location within {{SI|60|ft}} of the caster, if the crossroad was further away, the caster was able to determine its general direction. When a fey crossroad was detected, it appeared to the caster as a blue shadow shaped in a X. The spell prevented the caster from being tricked into using a fake crossroad. The spell did not provide information on what lies at the ends of the crossroads or where they lead. 

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
