'''''Lure''''' was a [[divine]] [[necromancy]] spell that temporarily transformed a single feature of a person's face or body. It was regularly used by the [[Sunite]] clergy to make themselves more attractive.

==Effects==
By casting this spell, the [[cleric]] could transform a single feature of their body to match that of another being. They could confer upon themself the eyes of a beast, alter their hand to become a claw or talon, or make similar physical changes. These effects lasted for a matter of hours, depending on the power of the caster.

While the spell always worked if a cleric targeted themself, there was a chance it could fail if cast upon someone else.

Multiple castings of ''lure'' could be cast on the same individual. All of these effects could be removed by a single casting of ''[[dispel magic]]''.

==History==
''Lure'' was one of the spells contained within the [[relic]] called the ''[[Sash of Sune]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a single drop of [[holy water]] and a small scrap of skin taken from the caster as a [[material component]].
