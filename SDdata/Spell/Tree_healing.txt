'''''Tree healing''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[necromancy]] or [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Mielikki]], enabling them to heal by melding with a tree. It was also available to priests of [[Gwaeron Windstrom]]

==Effects==
This spell allowed a wounded priest to heal by melding with a tree and receiving its own natural nutrients. The priest could remain hidden within the tree for as long as they desired to heal. The caster was fully aware of their surroundings while in this state but remained concealed from normal and magical detection, and they left no sign of their entry or presence on the outside of the tree. The caster was also protected from inclement weather conditions. The caster had no need to sleep, eat or even breathe while within the tree. There was a chance the tree would also neutralize any diseases carried by the caster, but it could not cure [[poison]]s bar those that naturally affected trees. Serious physical damage to the tree would harm the caster as well, and potentially expel them, and its destruction would slay them too. The caster could use any non-offensive magic while within the tree.

The spell would end when the caster left the tree unless they left some part of themselves within the tree, allowing them to stick out a head or hand as needed, but not step out entirely. The caster could not bring new items not present when the spell was cast back into the tree. After the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, its duration was limited to only a day, but the caster would be completely [[heal]]ed in that time.

This spell only functioned on natural trees, and not [[treant]]s or other [[plant creature]]s or sentient trees. The tree also needed to be large enough to contain the caster in height, width, and breadth.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast as well as a [[divine focus]].

==History==
It was recorded in ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy text of the church of Mielikki.<ref>

Although first associated with the [[church of Mielikki]], and shared with the churches of Gwaeron, and Rillifane, after 1372 it was also available to the allied [[church of Silvanus]] and [[church of Eldath]], with those initiated into the higher secrets of one of the three able to receive it.
