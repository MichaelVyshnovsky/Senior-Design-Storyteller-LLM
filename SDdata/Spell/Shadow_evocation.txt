Shadow evocation, formerly known as shadow magic (but not to be confused with the general field of shadow magic), was an illusion spell that drew energy from the Plane of Shadow in order to create a semi-real duplicate of any evocation spell of lesser power. If the victim recognized the illusion, the shadow energy was a lot less effective than the duplicated spell. A more powerful version of this spell also existed as greater shadow evocation.
Shadow evocation used verbal and somatic components only.
The spell was introduced in 3266 NY (−593 DR) by Netherese arcanist and researcher into the planes, Shadow, under the name Shadows magic, later simplified to shadow magic or shadow evocation.
Shadow evocation was an uncommon spell in Faerûn in the 1360s DR
