        "mainbody": "'''''Thorn spray''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Silvanus]], enabling them to animate thorns.{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|32-33}}",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to animate and hurl thorns, [[dart]]s, barbs, ''etc.'' with significant force. These could be launched from the caster's hand, from nearby plants, or from the ground or other places up to {{SI|10|yard|long=yes}} away, and numbered four initially, with more for more experienced casters. The hurled thorns could strike as many targets as the caster desired within {{SI|360|ft|long=yes}}. The darts could turn to avoid obstacles and follow targets in motion. ''Thorn spray'' would work underwater as well but to a range of only {{SI|270|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nAfter the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the caster threw a whole thorny plant at the targets, and its thorns sprayed at a number of creatures up to {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}}, or more for more experienced casters. They could select a single target or multiple targets. Those injured suffered stinging pain as if covered by nettles, hampering them for up to almost half a minute if they could not resist.\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]], the darts struck all within {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} and hampered those hurt by them.",
        "Usage": "This spell was particularly effective if used with darts coated with [[Sleeping poison|sleep-inducing poison]], as some priests, particularly [[druid]]s, carried them for this purpose. The darts were swift enough to bring down a flying bird.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components,",
        "History": "The spell was recorded in the ''[[Book of Num]]'', the [[spellbook|prayer book]] of the hermit known as [[Num|Num the Mad]]. It was also included in the ''[[Leaves of Green]]''.<ref>\n\nAlthough first associated with the [[church of Silvanus]], after 1372 it was also available to the allied [[church of Mielikki]] and [[church of Eldath]], with those initiated into the higher secrets of one of the three able to receive it.",
        "Notable Users": "* [[Robyn Kendrick]], learned from the spellbook of her mother [[Brianna Moonsinger]], Great Druid of the [[Mooonshae Isles]].<ref>\n* [[Shinthala Deepcrest]], Grand Cabal of the [[Emerald Enclave]].\n* Lady [[Shadowmoon Crystalembers]], Hierophant of the Emerald Enclave."
