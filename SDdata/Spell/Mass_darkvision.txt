'''''Mass darkvision''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that allowed several people to gain access to ''[[darkvision]]''.

==Effects==
''Mass darkvision'' conferred benefits similar to the ''[[darkvision (spell)|darkvision]]'' spell. The difference lay in scale. ''Mass darkvision'' allowed the caster to allow a number of creatures, which grew with the caster's skill, within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} to gain the benefits. There was a second version of this spell that gave any number of creatures the benefits, but only when they were within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}.

==Components==
The {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} variant worked like the ''darkvision'' The 10-feet-version required different material components in the form of an entire dried carrot or three agates.
