        "mainbody": "'''''Shatterbone''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that was used to fight the [[undead]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, a shimmering beam of gray light shot out from the caster's body in a single direction, and it was immobile. It caused the bones of undead creatures to explode. This was particularly effective when facing [[skeleton]]s, as the spell would turn their remains to dust, thus preventing their bones from being collected and used once again.",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a [[material component]]: glass shaped as a polished gemstone. At one point the glass had to have been exposed to the light from the sun at noon.",
        "History": "This spell was known to be used by [[wizard]]s of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]."
