'''''Burning spray''''' is an [[evocation school|evocation]] [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s, particularly [[Sorcerer#Dragon Sorcerer|those of a draconic heritage]]. When cast, ''burning spray'' allows a sorcerer to fling burning liquid from their arm as they sweep it and their [[implement]] through the air. The liquid, which sprays into a nearby area of roughly fifteen feet in diameter, causes any creatures it lands upon to be caught on fire, taking damage proportional to the strength of personality exhibited by the sorcerer casting the spell as well as that sorcerer's level of power. For dragon sorcerers there is an additional benefit to the spell, which leaves a trace of magical flame on the sorcerer so that when hit by an enemy melee attack, the attacker is scorched by the sorcerer's flesh to a degree dependent upon the sorcerer's physical strength. ''Burning spray'' is relatively easy to learn and can be recast at-will.
