Sacred flame was a basic prayer in the post-Spellplague era, turned divine cantrip following the Second Sundering, that was similar (though not identical) to the spell lance of faith. It was cast by clerics, primarily devoted clerics.
When sacred flame was cast the cleric invoked divine power, casting a beam of light from the heavens into the flesh of a creature within twenty-five feet, injuring them to a degree largely dependent on how focused and perceptive the caster was. The resulting blast allowed the cleric to grant a boost in courage and health to one ally within their sight. Being one of the most basic prayers during the post-Spellplague era, sacred flame could be cast at will.
