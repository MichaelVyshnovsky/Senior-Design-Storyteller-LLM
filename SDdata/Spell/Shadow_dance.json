        "Effects": "The spell transformed either the caster or a target they touched into a form resembling a [[shadow]]. The target was able to move in utter silence for the spell's duration as well as pass through the smallest crack or opening. A wizard could not cast spells while in this form, but they could end the spell whenever the wanted.\n\nThe target of this spell was immune to all energy-draining attacks. They also enjoyed a constant ''[[feather fall]]'' ability. Though they could not fly, they could \"dance\" upwards into the air at a slower pace.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s an eyelash or cobweb that was touched by moonlight to cast."
