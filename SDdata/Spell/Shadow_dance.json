        "mainbody": "Shadow dance was an alteration and necromancy wizard spell.\nThe spell transformed either the caster or a target they touched into a form resembling a shadow. The target was able to move in utter silence for the spells duration as well as pass through the smallest crack or opening. A wizard could not cast spells while in this form, but they could end the spell whenever the wanted.\nThe target of this spell was immune to all energy-draining attacks. They also enjoyed a constant feather fall ability. Though they could not fly, they could \"dance\" upwards into the air at a slower pace.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components an eyelash or cobweb that was touched by moonlight to cast."
