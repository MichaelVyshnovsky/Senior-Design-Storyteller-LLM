        "mainbody": "'''''Fire spiders''''' was a [[spell]] that summoned''[[Magic of Faer√ªn]]'' states that this spell summons [[fire elemental]]s that resemble mundane spiders in size and shape. However, the later published ''[[Shadowdale: The Scouring of the Land]]'' suggests that this spell instead summons a species of [[magical beast]] known as [[fire spider]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell conjured a swarm of around 240 fire spiders, which would search the surrounding area for something or someone to attack and ignite. These creatures were immune to fire, but vulnerable to [[water]] or other nonflammable liquids. They would not die after the attack. Instead they would stay until they were slain, banished, or the spell expired.",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|-2439}}, a group of [[Maerimydra]]n [[drow]] spellcasters based in the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] used this spell to set large parts of the southern [[Rystall Wood]]s on fire, separating it from [[Cormanthor]].",
        "Material components": "Casting this spell required [[ruby]]s or ruby dust worth at least 500 [[gold piece]]s. The spell also required a [[somatic component|somatic]] and [[verbal component]].",
        "Spellcasting Traditions": "*In the [[Rashemen]] spellcasting tradition of the [[vremyonni]], the [[material component]] for this spell was a pinch of [[sulfur]]."
