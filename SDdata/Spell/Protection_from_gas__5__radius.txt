Protection from gas, 5 radius was a spell used by the Red Wizards of Thay.
When cast, this spell protected the caster from the effects of all forms of gas. This included noxious, poisonous or toxic gas, gas-based breath weapons, and gas-based spells such as cloudkill or stinking cloud. It created a small area of protection around the caster, 5 feet (1.5 meters) in radius. This protected area moved with the caster.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component.
