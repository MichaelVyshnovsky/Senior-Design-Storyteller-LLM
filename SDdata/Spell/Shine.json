        "mainbody": "'''''Shine''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that [[wizard]]s-in-training could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It was an adjunct to the ''[[polish]]'' cantrip that removed corrosion, tarnish, rust, verdigris, and similar signs of age and neglect from objects. It could also enhance below-average quality [[gem]]s.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip could affect one object of up to {{SI|1|cu yd|long=yes}} in volume per casting. ''Shine'' smoothed out any small imperfections, removed specks of rust or patinas of tarnish, and, if the surface of the object could support it, brought out a mirror-quality luster. It could be used to clean [[jewelry]] and could even give below-average quality gems a chance to be appraised a bit higher in value. Like similar cantrips, the target object had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster hummed a simple tune while making buffing motions with a hand."
