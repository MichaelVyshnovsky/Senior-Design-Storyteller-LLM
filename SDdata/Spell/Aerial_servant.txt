'''Aerial servants''' were a semi-intelligent form of [[air elemental]].

==Description==
Aerial servants appeared dimly visible on their home [[plane]]s, but completely invisible on the [[Prime Material plane]]. They resembled the upper halves of [[humanoid]]s made of sparking blue vapor. Their white and blue smoky bodies had only slits for facial features, and large ethereal hands with four stretched-out fingers.

==Behavior==
Aerial servants never displayed interest in the affairs of other planes and would never voluntarily leave their home plane. This was due in part to the fact that residing in calm weather was known to cause aerial servants to gradually grow weaker and lifeless. They also held no desire to collect treasure.

When summoned a summoned aerial servant would obediently complete any task for their conjurers, with the exception of fighting, unless prevented from doing so. While on the Prime Material the aerial servant harbored resentment towards their summoner. If they were prevented from fulfilling their task, aerial servants were known to go insane at striking out at their masters.

==Biology==
Possessing ultra-high speed and strength. They could carry weights in excess of 10,000 [[gp]] and move at speeds twice that of an [[invisible stalker]].

Aerial servants could only reproduce in areas of extreme weather, where they were drawn to. Whilst engaged in such a storm, there was a chance that the servant would be blown with such force that it would create another of its kind. However, this process was incredibly painful for them, thus they strove to avoid it.

==Combat==
Although they generally preferred to avoid combat on their home planes. When summoned to another, they fought using their supernatural strength. Strangling opponents with their extended fingers until they suffocated. Only exceptionally strong opponents could break free of their grasp.

Aerial servants often used their invisibility on the Prime Material to surprise opponents.

==Society==
These elemental kin did not form families or communities, but only appeared to wander alone. They spent much of their time soaring through their native plane, revealing its infinite mysteries.
===Diet===
Aerial servants fed on the planar wind of their home plane, which constituted their life force. These elementals had to be nourished in such a way at least monthly.
===Homelands===
Aerial servants were not known keep lairs or specific territories. As the cyclones, wind storms, hurricanes, and maelstroms of the [[Elemental Plane of Air]] generally did not pose a threat to them, aerial servants were often found in these areas. In the [[Astral plane]] they were found around its psychic wind storms, while in the [[Ethereal plane]] they were found around its ether cyclones.

On the Prime Material plane, aerial servants were often found throughout [[Calimshan]], either guarding others creatures' treasure chambers or wandering around after their summoner had failed to control them.
===Relationships===
Aerial servants typically didn't associate with other creatures, though had a natural affinity for their fellow air elementals. However, their kin often discouraged interaction with them; many air elementals viewed aerial servants as being inferior to them.

Powerful [[cleric]]s were capable of summoning them to Prime Material by means of the ''[[Aerial servant (spell)|aerial servant]]'' spell. Clerics typically prepared for any resentment and hostility the semi-intelligent elementals might feel towards them by casting ''[[protection from evil]]'' beforehand.

==Notable Aerial Servants==
* [[El-Tarifa]], the majordomo of [[Chininsk Ambar]].
