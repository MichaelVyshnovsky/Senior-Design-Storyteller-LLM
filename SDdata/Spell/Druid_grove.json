        "mainbody": "'''''Druid grove''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s that called upon the spirits of nature to protect an area.",
        "Effects": {
            "Solid fog": ":Areas of the caster's choice within the warded zone became filled with thick fog that completely obscured vision and considerably impaired movement of creatures going through it. Immune creatures viewed the area as a soft mist peppered with floating sparks of green light.",
            "Grasping undergrowth": ":Areas of the caster's choice that were not filled with fog grew weeds and vines that grabbed at intruders in an effect similar to the ''[[entangle]]'' spell, restraining and slowing them down. For creatures that were immune, the vines shaped themselves as soft seats and beds.",
            "Grove guardians": ":Up to four [[tree]]s inside the area ''[[awaken]]ed'' and became effectively mute [[awakened tree]]s covered in [[Druidic language|Druidic]] symbols. They relentlessly defended the area against all intruders and obeyed all the caster's spoken commands. When the spell ended, the trees lost their animation and retook their roots, if possible.\n\nIn addition, the caster could choose one additional effect to fill the area, such as a ''[[gust of wind]]'' in up to two locations, a ''[[spike growth]]'' in one location, or a ''[[wind wall]]'' in up to two locations. All these effects were harmless to immune creatures.\n\nThe area remained warded for 24 hours, radiating a strong magical aura. If the spell was cast on the same location every day for a full year, the effects became permanent, or until dispelled."

        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required, which was consumed by the spell, was [[mistletoe]] that needed to be harvested with a [[gold]]en [[sickle]] under the light of a full [[Sel√ªne (moon)|moon]]."
