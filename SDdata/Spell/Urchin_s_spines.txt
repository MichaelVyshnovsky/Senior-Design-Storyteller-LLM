'''Urchin's Spines''' was a [[transmutation]] spell that covers the target's body with long spines akin to an [[urchin]]'s.

==Effects==
The creature affected by the spell had their skin, along with clothes and armor, transmuted into 2-inch spine-covered hide. Anyone who tried to grapple the spined creature got pierced by the urchin's needles as well as mild poison damage that caused the opponent to suffer fortitude and dexterity drain.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components or arcane focus. The component used was a spine from an [[urchin]].
