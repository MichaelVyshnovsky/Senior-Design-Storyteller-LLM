'''''Chilling scythe''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to priests of [[Kelemvor]].

==Effects==
When cast, a massive scythe appeared in the hands of the caster. Despite its size, it was weightless and could be wielded by any living creature.

As a weapon, a ''chilling scythe'' caused piercing and slashing damage, as well as draining some of the life force of the target.

If used against any [[undead]], the damage was devastating. Even the mere touch of the scythe inflicted massive harm to an undead target and sent it flying into air, landing up to {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} away.

==History==
This spell was inscribed within the [[Kelemvor]]ite [[relic]] the ''[[Testament of Vraer]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a [[material component]], namely a piece of bone.
