'''''Presper's double wizardry''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the school of [[alteration]] created by [[Presper]]. This spell was the predecessor of ''[[Algarth's embattlement]]''.

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to store up to four spells for use at a later time. The spells to be stored were cast after casting the ''double wizardry''. Storing spells in this manner harmed the caster and their health could not be recovered until the stored spells were cast.

The caster could call forth up to two of the stored spells to take effect at the same time. A successful ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell against the ''double wizardry'' caused the least powerful stored spell to erupt outward to the source of the ''dispel magic'' spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]] a double-yolked egg to cast. The egg did not need to be fresh and even a petrified version would suffice.
