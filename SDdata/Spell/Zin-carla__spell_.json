        "mainbody": "Zin-carla was a spell practiced by the drow, given only to those who had most pleased Lolth the Spider Queen.\nZin-carla was a spell that could give a corpse a semblance of life. It was a more advanced form of reanimation, where the reanimated corpse was not simply a mindless zombie, but retained all the capabilities it had while it was alive. The corpse was also bound to do a single task, chosen by the person that reanimated it and approved by Lolth. To give the corpse the abilities it had while it was alive, the spirit of the person who the corpse belonged to in life was called to inhabit the body, but was given very little control over the corpses actions beyond the use of its abilities.\nIn 1338 DR, Zaknafein DoUrden, weapons master of House DoUrden, was reanimated in this grisly way ten years after being killed in sacrifice to Lolth. Matron Mother Malice DoUrden ordered zin-carla so she could send Zaknafein out to destroy Drizzt DoUrden, who had betrayed the family ten years before. The yochlol present gasped and told her shed gone too far, but eventually agreed. The priestesses of House DoUrden had to work for weeks before they could send Zak out hunting. Zin-carla made Zak do things he wouldnt have done normally, and he killed many of the inhabitants of the Underdark before he reached Drizzt in Blingdenstone. However, he ultimately hurled himself into a chasm in the Acid Aerie to prevent himself from killing his son."
