'''''Glowglory''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[dwarven]] [[cleric]]s.
==Effects==
When this spell was cast upon a normal stone it caused the affected item to radiate a ''continual light'' and emit a mild degree of heat. This latter effect was known to be useful in staving off the affects of exposure in cold climates.

When cast upon a ''[[glowstone]]'', this spell caused a bright beam of radiant force to be unleashed from it. This beam could be directed by the caster as either a continuous or pulsating stream. It was capable of cutting through all manner of wood, stone, and even flesh.  Though this beam could be used offensively as a weapon, it was often used to quarry or create passages within solid stone.

The effects of glowglory would cease upon the caster dying, falling unconscious, or casting another spell.
==Components==
A cleric needed either a ''glowstone'' or a regular stone to cast the spell upon. They also required a pinch of either [[gold]]-dust or [[gem]]-dust.
