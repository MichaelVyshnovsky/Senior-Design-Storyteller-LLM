'''Rocs''' were gargantuan birds of prey that inhabited the highest mountains in warm and subtropical regions.

As large as these great birds were, they paled in both size and ferocity to the mighty [[Zakharan roc]]s of the [[Zakhara|Land of Fate]].

==Description==
Rocs were massive avians with feathers that were normally either dark brown or golden in color, although rare black, red, or white rocs were sometimes reported. From the head to the base of the tail, rocs were a minimum of {{SI|30|ft}} long, and as much as {{SI|60|ft}}. Their wingspans were a staggering {{SIrange|80|120|ft}}, and rocs weighed some {{SI|8000|lb|k}}.

==Combat==
[[File:Rocking rocs.png|thumb|''Adventurers be warned: Stealing roc eggs is inadvisable!''|350x350px]]
Rocs hunted, and attacked, by swooping down from the sky with talons outstretched to snatch and carry off prey. A single roc would be hunting, and therefore willing to try and take any suitably sized creature, but a pair of rocs would act in concert and fight to the death to defend the nest and eggs or hatchlings.

==Ecology==
Rocs were massive birds of prey that were known to carry off very large prey, including [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s, and even [[elephant]]s. They typically lived in warmer, mountainous regions, and dwelled far apart from each other to avoid straining the supply of prey. Rocs hunted in a territory of about {{SI|10|mi}} around their nest.

The lair of a roc was a vast nest of trees, branches, and the like. Its treasure was strewn about, for the creature did not place any value upon it. The egg was large, green, and spotted.

Rocs were usually solitary, but were sometimes found in mated pairs.

Rocs often guarded the nests of [[simurgh]]s until they were mature.

==Uses==
Rocs were occasionally tamed and used by [[giant]]s.<ref>

Roc feathers were commonly used in manufacturing ''[[Quaal's feather token]]s'' and ''[[Broom of flying|brooms of flying]]''.

==Homelands==

Rocs were found in the [[Utter East]], making their nests in the [[Serpent Valley]], [[Web Mountains]], and even underground in the [[Realm of Fire]]. Their nests could hold treasure from past victims, if one dared brave the parent and hatchling.

==History ==
Lord [[Charles Frederik LaVerne Blacktree IV]] was known for wearing a roc feather in his hat.<ref>
