Protection from lightning was an abjuration spell that absorbed damage due to lightning and other electrical shocks.
This spell was almost identical to protection from fire except it absorbed damage due to electricity and electrical effects instead of heat and fire. It also had the unusual property of having different effects when cast on oneself or on another creature. When cast on oneself, an aura surrounded the caster that absorbed electrical damage up to a maximum based on the casters level. When cast on another creature, protection from lightning greatly improved the chances of avoiding some of the damage and reduced any remaining damage by half. The duration of the protection was 10 minutes per level of the caster, or until the aura had absorbed its full amount of shock damage.
Verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell, as well as the casters holy symbol.
