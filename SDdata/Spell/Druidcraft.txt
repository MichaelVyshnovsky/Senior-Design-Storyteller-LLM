'''''Druidcraft''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to commune with spirits to cause minor effects.

==Effect==
The spell could have one of four effects chosen by the caster:
* Make a minor prediction of the weather within the area for the next 24 hours. The prediction would show, for example, a golden orb for clear sunny skies that would last for a couple of seconds.
* Make a flower instantly go into bloom, a leaf bud bloom, or a seed pod open.
* Instantly create a sensory effect, like falling leaves, the sound of an animal, the odor of a skunk, or a puff of wind. The effect only existed within a 5-foot-wide cube (1.5 meters).
* Light or extinguish a small flame like a candle or small campfire instantly.

==Components==
Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were needed for the casting of the spell.
