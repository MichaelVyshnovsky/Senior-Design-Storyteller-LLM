Nap was a spell used by clerics.
When cast, this spell placed a targeted creature into an hour-long nap. The nap, despite being so short, rejuvenated the recipient as if they had a restful full night of sleep. The spell could only be cast once on a creature per eighteen hours. The spell could only function on a willing creature.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, a feather, a piece of pillow ticking and a pebble. The pebble had to be in the pocket of the caster for seven consecutive nights.
This spell was inscribed within Wythyndles Round Book, one of the few holy books of the Church of Milil. It could also be cast by the Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the faith of Mystra.
