Sting was a person-affecting cantrip that apprentice wizards could learn. It caused an annoying pain in a target creature that was possibly disruptive. Sting was generally used to intimidate or warn people or creatures that they should show the caster some respect.
This cantrip could target one creature within  of the caster and, if not resisted, caused the target to experience a momentary but intense pain in a spot on their body chosen by the caster. If successfully cast on the eyes, it caused blindness. If cast on the tongue, it garbled speech. If cast on a hand, it ruined any precise manipulation of small objects, with a fifty-fifty chance to drop them. All of these effects lasted less than one minute and did no direct physical damage, but were enough to disrupt the casting of a spell if it spoiled the verbal, somatic, or material component of the spell being cast.The Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four reduced the range and slightly altered the duration of this spells effects. When cast, this spell gave off a small cloud of harmless blue sparks.
Sting required verbal and somatic components to cast. While looking at the target creature, the caster made a buzzing sound (like "bzzzt") and pointed to a spot on their own body where they wished the target creature to feel pain.
The description of this cantrip was recorded in the spellbook known as The Alcaister, along with cut and gallop.The three cantrips described in Dragon #100 were replaced with the cantrip spell when the 2-edition Pages from the Mages was published. The Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four describes all the 1-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with cantrip.
