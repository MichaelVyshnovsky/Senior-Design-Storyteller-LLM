        "mainbody": "Dune was an uncommon conjuration spell of the southern magic tradition that created a magical sand dune.\nThe spell would create a sand dune which transported a target creature to the caster. The amount of creatures that could be transported by the spell was dependant on the casters skill level. The spell only functioned in a sandy area. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a pinch of sand."
