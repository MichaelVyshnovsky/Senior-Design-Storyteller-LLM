Skeletal bride was a wizard spell from the school of necromancy.
This spell created a skeletal form that was the same height and size as the caster. The head was flesh-colored with hair of any length the caster desired, but the face was featureless. The skeletal bride was not a form of undead so was immune to any magical attacks designed to specifically harm undead.
The caster could move the bride about with their mind but the bride would collapse into a pile of dust if moved beyond the range of the spell. This spell was effective if used as a decoy to spring an ambush designed for the caster. The bride could not speak, but spells such as ventriloquism could be used on them to make it appear as if they could.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a human bone to cast.
