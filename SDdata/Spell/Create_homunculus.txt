'''''Create homunculus''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s to create a [[homunculus]]. 

==Effects==
A wizard was only able to use this spell to create a single homunculus at a time. If cast while the original homunculus still lived, the spell failed. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required several [[material component]]s: ash, clay, and the root from a [[mandrake]] plant. It also required an expensive [[dagger]] encrusted with jewels worth at least 1,000 [[gp]]. During casting, the wizard spoke the verbal component and cut themselves with the dagger. Blood was dripped onto the ash, clay, and root. The wizard then touched the material components and if the casting was performed correctly, a homunculus was created.
