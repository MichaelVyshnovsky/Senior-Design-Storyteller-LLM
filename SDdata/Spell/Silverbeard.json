        "mainbody": "Silverbeard was a transmutation spell used by dwarven paladins who worshiped Clangeddin Silverbeard.\nThis spell turned a dwarfs beard into magically hardened pure silver. The silver was actually hard enough to offer protection during combat. This spell would transform a beard, or make the caster grown one for the duration of the spell.\nSilverbeard was often used to impress other dwarves, though overuse of the spell caused a natural beard to turn a silver color.\nThis spell required verbal components to cast."
