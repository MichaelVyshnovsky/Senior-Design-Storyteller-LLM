'''''Ruby ray of reversal''''', also known as '''''Nezram's ruby ray''''', was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] or [[alteration]] spell that reversed, undid, negated, circumvented, or destroyed particular magical spells, mundane hazards, or adverse situations.

==Effects==
When cast, a narrow lance of bright red light emitted from the caster's fingertips in the direction he or she pointed toward a single target. The range of the beam increased with the level of the caster but was at least {{SI|240|ft|long=yes}} for the newer version and {{SI|420|ft|long=yes}} for the older version. If the target was one of the following, then it was altered or negated as described.
* Doors or containers that were locked or barred by mundane physical means, or by ''[[arcane lock]]'' or ''[[hold portal]]'' spells, were opened.
* Knotted [[rope]]s, [[leather]] straps, [[chain]]s, [[shackles]], [[manacles]], and other restricting devices or mechanisms became untied, unbuckled, unlocked, unwound, or loosened to the point of falling off.
* Magical or mechanical [[trap]]s were sprung. The caster had to recognize or be made aware of a trap in order to cast this spell on it.
* Magical or mundane ''[[web]]s'', viscous globs, ''[[grease]]'', slime, or the effects of ''[[entangle]]'' and similar spells were dissipated or melted away completely up to a radius of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}.
* [[Petrified]], ''[[polymorph]]ed'' or otherwise transformed creatures were restored to their original, natural state, although the shock to their system was sometimes fatal.
* ''[[Wall of force]]'', ''[[forcecage]]'', or similar spells could be breached by a hole centered on the point where the ''ruby ray'' touched it. The hole lasted for as long as the ''wall'' or ''cage'' and could allow objects or creatures to pass through or spells to be cast through it. The hole was {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in diameter for the older version of this spell and twice as big for the newer version.
* A ''[[magic jar]]'' spell was dispelled or reversed if the receptacle holding a soul was hit by ''ruby ray of reversal''.
* The older version of this spell also dispelled [[illusion]]s upon contact.
The ''ruby ray'' was blocked by solid or opaque objects and had no effect on ''[[anti-magic shell]]s'', ''[[prismatic sphere]]s'' or other spells or circumstances not listed above. Only one target could be designated per casting of this spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a [[ruby]] valued at 1,000 [[gp]] or more for each casting of the spell.

==History==
This spell was invented by the famed [[transmuter]] [[Nezram]] and set down in his book ''[[Unique Mageries]]'', which he left behind and never returned to claim. ''Ruby ray of reversal'' was later published in "[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]" and became generally known to the magical community although it was rare to find it.
