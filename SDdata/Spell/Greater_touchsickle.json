        "mainbody": "Greater touchsickle was a divine magic spell available to druids, clerics, and crusaders of Eldath, the Mother Guardian of Groves. It was a more potent version of touchsickle.\nThis spell was identical to the touchsickle spell except that the casters hand became a sickle +2 that could damage any and all creatures that were immune to normal weapons. The duration of greater touchsickle was eighteen minutes, with more experienced casters able to extend this time limit.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.\nPeacemen and peacewomen, the specialty priests of Eldath, were not granted this spell. For druids, the touchsickle was equivalent to a golden or silver sickle for the purpose of harvesting mistletoe at its greatest potency."
