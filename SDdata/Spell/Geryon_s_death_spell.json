        "mainbody": "eryons death spell was an extremely dangerous and forbidden spell, created by Geryon, sometime before his demise in the early 14 century DR.\nGeryons death spell started with complex patterns of colored light that opened a swirling color rift in the sky. At the center of the colorful storm, a rift the size of a coin opened and grew to eclipse the sun. An enormous eye peeked out of the rift, only to disappear moments later, before the rift began to suck unsecured things from the earth in whilst creating whirlwinds of dust and sand on the ground.\nDuring the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, shortly after the death of Mystra at the hands of Helm, the mage adventurer Midnight used diamond dust to cast a wall of force. However, with the goddesss death, magic was turned into chaos. Instead of creating a wall of force, Midnight unleashed Geryons death spell on the battlefield. Luckily, Elminster of Shadowdale stepped in just in time to counter the spell. Once he was sure that Geryons death spell was an accidental conjuring and that Midnight did not have the forbidden spell written down, Elminster departed."
