        "mainbody": "'''''Geryon's death spell''''' was an extremely dangerous and forbidden [[spell]], created by [[Geryon]], sometime before his demise in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{quote|''That is the direct effect of Geryon's death spell. Spells of this sort are directly forbidden, although it is difficult to punish transgressors as they are usually dead before the spell reaches this stage! Besides that, Geryon himself died over fifty summers ago.''|[[Elminster]]}}",
        "Effects": "''Geryon's death spell'' started with complex patterns of colored light that opened a swirling color rift in the sky. At the center of the colorful storm, a rift the size of a [[coin]] opened and grew to eclipse the sun. An enormous eye peeked out of the rift, only to disappear moments later, before the rift began to suck unsecured things from the earth in whilst creating whirlwinds of dust and sand on the ground.",
        "History": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], shortly after the death of [[Mystra]] at the hands of [[Helm]], the [[mage]] adventurer [[Midnight]] used [[diamond]] dust to cast a ''[[wall of force]]''. However, with the goddess's death, magic was turned into chaos. Instead of creating a ''wall of force,'' Midnight unleashed ''Geryon's death spell'' on the battlefield. Luckily, Elminster of [[Shadowdale]] stepped in just in time to counter the spell. Once he was sure that ''Geryon's death spell'' was an accidental conjuring and that Midnight did not have the forbidden spell written down, Elminster departed."
