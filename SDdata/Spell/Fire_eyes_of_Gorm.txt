'''''Fire eyes of Gorm''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Gorm Gulthyn]].

==Effects==
When cast, the caster shot brilliant [[ruby]]-red rays of fire from both eyes. The rays were incredibly hot, hot enough to burn a hole clear through [[plate armor]] and most stone walls. While the spell was in effect, the caster was able to see normally but was not capable of casting any further spells. The caster also had the ability to control the beams, by temporarily interrupting them. This allowed the caster to look at an object, or individual, without inflicting damage. The caster was not harmed by the beams but could be burned from the fires they may cause. Creatures with a natrual or magical resistance to fire were unaffected by this spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], the holy symbol of Gorm Gulthyn.
