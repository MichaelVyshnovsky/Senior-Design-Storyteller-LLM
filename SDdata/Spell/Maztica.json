        "mainbody": "Abeir Toril\nMaztica (), referred to by its inhabitants as The True World, was a large continent west of Faerûn. Maztica was a land of jungles and mystery.\nNorth of Maztica was the continent of Anchorome and south of it was Lopango.\n* Payit A native nation covered in open savannas and dense jungles.\n* Far Payit A large jungle land with few settlements.\n* Sea of Azul A large body of water that separated Far Payit from the House of Tezca.\n* Gulf of Cordell This oceanic gulf lay on Mazticas eastern coast, north of Payit.\n* Pezelac An agricultural nation west of Payit.\n* The Valley of Nexal A fertile valley west of Pezelac and east of Huacli, it was home to several Maztican city-states, included Nexal.\n* Huacli A native confederation of six city-states west of Nexal.\n* Kultaka A native kingdom to the north east of Nexal.\n* House of Tezca A large desert south of Nexal.\n* Kolan A native nation on the western coast of Maztica, west of the House of Tezca.\n* The Sands of Itzcala  A great desert north of Nexal, home of the Dog People.\n* The Pasocada Basin A river basin north and west of the Sands of Itzcala.\nthumb|A late 14 century 400x400px\nMaztica was originally the name of the Maztican goddess of earth and life. It was believed that she, along with her husband and her children (the other deities of the Maztican pantheon), created the land, the plants and animals, and humans. Early in the continents history, the gods Qotal and Zaltec fought over it, until a crime against his sister caused Qotal to retreat from the land for ages.\nLater on, the Payit people of Payit and Far Payit built a mighty civilization. They were a peaceful people, but they gained much knowledge and wisdom during their golden age. They also built great cities of stone and made wondrous works of art and pluma. However, the Golden Age of Payit eventually came to an end in treachery and murder.\nShortly after the golden age ended, a tribe of Dog People arrived in the western Valley of Nexal. The Valley of Nexal had its own people, and their own culture, but that small tribe eventually built a city-state of their own, Nexal. They went on to conquer and rule a mighty empire, the greatest in Maztica, for almost 300 years.\nMaztica was discovered by Amnian explorers led by Captain Cordell and his Golden Legion in the . Amn was quick to lay its claim to the land for trade benefits, establishing the port city of Helmsport. The invaders ruthlessly conquered the native peoples and extracted the lands natural resources. The church of Helm playing a key part in this, tainting its reputation back in Faerûn. Lantan also claimed some lands.\nSome tlincallis from Maztica teleported to Oaxaptupa under Amn in the Underdark of Faerûn.\nDuring the Spellplague of , Maztica was subsumed by the wild magic and sent to the world of Abeir. People mistakenly believed it was replaced by a continent of that world that was sent to Toril during the catastrophe, Laerakond.Something that cannot be possible, due to Laerakonds being located in the Great Sea, according to Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide (page 201). Maztica was returned to Toril during the Second Sundering, around 1486 or . A few tabaxi emigrated to Faerûn after that, although the tabaxi never talked about what changes Maztica may have experienced in her century in another world, besides the fact that there were some strange changes.\nthumb|right|250px|A map of late 1400s Faerûn, with Mazticas Payit region visible in the south-west corner.\nMaztica was still marked on maps of Toril following the Second Sundering in the late 1400s DR.\nMaztica was dominated by the nations of Nexal, Kultaka, Huacli, Kolan, Pezelac and Payit. However, there were many other groups and tribes within its mountains and jungles and deserts.\nMaztica was primarily inhabited by humans. These humans were split into four basic ethnic groups, the Payits, the Nexalans, the Green Folk, and the North Ones (more commonly called the Dog People).\n* The Payits tended to be short and muscular, and had a strong tradition of learning, art, and astronomy. They mainly occupied the eastern side of Maztica, in the nation of Payit and the jungles of Far Payit.\n*The Nexalans were the inhabitants of Central Maztica, holding the nations of Nexal, Huacli, Pezelac, and Kultaka. They were leaner and taller than Payits, with angular features. Their culture was warlike, and they lacked the artistic and scholarly inclinations of their eastern neighbors.\n*The Green Folk mostly lived far south of Central Maztica, in the jungles south of the House of Tezca. However, the Kolan people along the western coast was an offshoot of them. They protected their privacy fiercely, and were skilled archers with a tribal society.\n*The North Ones, more commonly called the Dog People was another tribal society, but one that dwelled in the desert north of Central Maztica, the Sand of Itzcala. They were extremely loyal, and hardy enough that they could basically ignore pain and privation. They were renowned for their stealth and savage fighting.\nIn addition, wild halflings were said to live in the deepest jungles of Far Payit, and desert dwarves inhabited the House of Tezca desert.\nMany unique monstrous races also lived in Maztica, including\n*Chac\n*Jagre\n*Jaguar lord\n*Tlalocoatl\n*Kamatlan"
