        "History": "[[File:Maztica atlas.png|thumb|''A late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] map of post-[[Night of Wailing]] Maztica.''|400x400px]]\n[[Maztica (goddess)|Maztica]] was originally the name of the Maztican goddess of earth and life. It was believed that she, along with her husband and her children (the other deities of the [[Maztican pantheon]]), created the land, the plants and animals, and humans. Early in the continent's history, the gods [[Qotal]] and [[Zaltec]] fought over it, until a crime against his sister caused Qotal to retreat from the land for ages.<ref>\n\nLater on, the Payit people of [[Payit]] and [[Far Payit]] built a mighty civilization. They were a peaceful people, but they gained much knowledge and wisdom during their golden age. They also built great cities of stone and made wondrous works of art and [[pluma]]. However, the Golden Age of Payit eventually came to an end in treachery and murder.<ref>\n\nShortly after the golden age ended, a tribe of Dog People arrived in the western Valley of Nexal. The Valley of Nexal had its own people, and their own culture, but that small tribe eventually built a city-state of their own, Nexal. They went on to conquer and rule a mighty empire, the greatest in Maztica, for almost 300 years.<ref>\n\nMaztica was 'discovered' by [[Amnian]] explorers led by Captain [[Cordell]] and his [[Golden Legion]] in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}. [[Amn]] was quick to lay its claim to the land for trade benefits, establishing the port city of [[Helmsport]].<ref> The invaders ruthlessly conquered the native peoples and extracted the land's natural resources. The [[church of Helm]] playing a key part in this, tainting its reputation back in Faerûn.<ref> [[Lantan]] also claimed some lands.\n\nSome [[tlincalli]]s from Maztica teleported to [[Oaxaptupa]] under [[Amn]] in the [[Underdark]] of [[Faerûn]].<ref>\n\nDuring the Spellplague of {{Yearlink|1385}}, Maztica was subsumed by the [[wild magic]] and sent to the world of [[Abeir]].{{Cite dragon+/11/Lore You Should Know: Tabaxi vs. tabaxi}} People mistakenly believed it was replaced by a continent of that world that was sent to Toril during the catastrophe, [[Laerakond]].<ref><ref group=\"note\">Something that cannot be possible, due to Laerakond's being located in the [[Great Sea]], according to ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'' (page 201). Maztica was returned to Toril during the Second Sundering, around [[1486 DR|1486]] or {{Yearlink|1487}}.<ref><ref> A few [[tabaxi]] emigrated to Faerûn after that, although the tabaxi never talked about what changes Maztica may have experienced in her century in another world, besides the fact that there were some strange changes.<ref>\n\n[[File:Faerun 15th century DR.png|thumb|right|250px|''A map of late 1400s Faerûn, with Maztica's Payit region visible in the south-west corner.'']]\nMaztica was still marked on maps of Toril following the [[Second Sundering]] in the late 1400s [[DR]].<ref>",
        "Politics": "Maztica was dominated by the nations of [[Nexal]], [[Kultaka]], [[Huacli]], [[Kolan]], [[Pezelac]] and [[Payit]]. However, there were many other groups and tribes within its mountains and jungles and deserts.",
        "Inhabitants": "Maztica was primarily inhabited by [[human]]s. These humans were split into four basic ethnic groups, the [[Payit (ethnicity)|Payits]], the [[Nexalan]]s, the [[Green Folk]], and the [[Dog People|North Ones]] (more commonly called the Dog People).\n* The '''Payits''' tended to be short and muscular, and had a strong tradition of learning, art, and astronomy. They mainly occupied the eastern side of Maztica, in the nation of Payit and the jungles of Far Payit.\n*The '''Nexalans''' were the inhabitants of Central Maztica, holding the nations of Nexal, Huacli, Pezelac, and Kultaka. They were leaner and taller than Payits, with angular features. Their culture was warlike, and they lacked the artistic and scholarly inclinations of their eastern neighbors.\n*The '''Green Folk''' mostly lived far south of Central Maztica, in the jungles south of the House of Tezca. However, the Kolan people along the western coast was an offshoot of them. They protected their privacy fiercely, and were skilled archers with a tribal society.\n*The '''North Ones''', more commonly called the '''Dog People''' was another tribal society, but one that dwelled in the desert north of Central Maztica, the Sand of Itzcala. They were extremely loyal, and hardy enough that they could basically ignore pain and privation. They were renowned for their stealth and savage fighting.\n\nIn addition, [[wild halfling]]s were said to live in the deepest jungles of Far Payit, and [[Desert dwarf|desert dwarves]] inhabited the House of Tezca desert.<ref>",
        "Notable Creatures": "Many unique monstrous races also lived in Maztica, including:<ref>\n*[[Chac]]\n*[[Jagre]]\n*[[Jaguar lord]]\n*[[Tlalocoatl]]\n*[[Kamatlan]]"
