        "mainbody": "'''''Invisibility to spirits''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "A shugenja used this spell to become invisible to spirits of all types. This spell did not make a shugenja invisible to non-spirits. The shugenja was able to move through spirits without detection. If the shugenja attacked a spirit while invisible, they became visible to the spirit. If an item was picked up while invisible, it did not become invisible as well; instead, it appeared to be floating in thin air.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell and its reverse required [[material component]]s: a calligraphy brush and a jar of red [[ink]]. During casting, the shugenja used these items to write sutras over each part to become invisible to spirits."
