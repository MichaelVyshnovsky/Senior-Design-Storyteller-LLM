        "mainbody": "Invisibility to spirits was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nA shugenja used this spell to become invisible to spirits of all types. This spell did not make a shugenja invisible to non-spirits. The shugenja was able to move through spirits without detection. If the shugenja attacked a spirit while invisible, they became visible to the spirit. If an item was picked up while invisible, it did not become invisible as well instead, it appeared to be floating in thin air.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell and its reverse required material components a calligraphy brush and a jar of red ink. During casting, the shugenja used these items to write sutras over each part to become invisible to spirits."
