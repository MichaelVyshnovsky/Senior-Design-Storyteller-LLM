'''''Awaken magical item''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] and [[invocation]] [[spell]] that resembled a lesser version of the ''[[enchant an item]]'' spell.

==Effects==
This spell permanently activated a [[magic item]] with multiple functions when touched. This spell was used in conjuction with ''[[eternal flame]]'', ''[[wondrous web]]'' or ''[[holy vesting]]'', and multiple ''[[dweomerflow]]'' castings. This spell could be used on a previously created magic item in order to add new magical functions to the item.

A successful ''awakening'' usually involved a flash of harmless light upon the spell's completion, otherwise the magic item would either crumble into useless dust or explode violently.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a [[priest]] spell [[scroll]] containing at least as many spells as the item had functions, a [[gemstone]] worth at least 2,500 [[gp]] for each item function, and a living plant that had been changed by [[magic]] to cast.

==History==
This spell was incredibly rare according to [[Volothamp Geddarm]].
