'''''Internal fire''''' was a powerful [[spell]] commonly used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur, although some [[Elementalist|fire mages]] in [[Faer√ªn]] knew of the spell.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a fatally intense amount of heat inside a target. The target eventually burst into flame, killing them instantly. If the target had an item or equipment that gave fire resistance, they were unaffected by the spell. A creature with a natural immunity to fire would also be unaffected by this spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], an [[iron]] canister filled with hot [[charcoal]].
