Quell was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
Wu jen used this spell to overpower a creature. The target creature instantly surrendered to the wu jen. Additionally, a wu jen could use this spell to compel the target creature into a period of service. This part of the spell was only effective if the creature understood the language spoken by the wu jen. The task a wu jen demanded was dependent on certain conditions. A wu jen was unable to compel the creature to do a deadly task, and the task had to be within the understanding of the creature. When the task was successfully completed, the spell expired.
The spell required verbal and somatic components. During casting, the wu jen uttered the verbal components while pointing at the target creature.
