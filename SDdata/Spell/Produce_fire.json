        "mainbody": "'''Produce fire''' was an [[alteration]] spell used by [[druid]]s that generated a mundane fire for a few seconds. The reverse of this spell, '''quench fire''', extinguished all normal fires in the area of effect.",
        "Effect": "When cast, a fire could be conjured within an area measuring roughly {{SI|12|sq ft|long=yes}}, anywhere within {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} of the caster. Like any mundane fire it was liable to cause harm to creatures and ignite combustible materials, such as [[oil]], [[paper]], or wood. The reverse of the spell could quench any mundane fire within a {{SI|12|sq ft|long=yes}} area regardless of its source of origin, including oil, wood, wax, and [[coal]] fires.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[somatic]] and [[verbal]] components, casting this spell required a [[material component]]."
