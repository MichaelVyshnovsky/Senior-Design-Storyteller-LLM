'''''Wrap''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that acolyte [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It conjured a flexible container for a small amount of a solid substance and was typically used to organize and prepare [[spell component]]s for travel.

==Effects==
This cantrip had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and could create a bag, sack, [[pouch]], envelope, or similar container made from a material appropriate for holding the target substance. Examples included a felt pouch for [[gem]]s, a cloth bag for flour, a burlap sack for [[potato]]es, tissue-thin [[paper]] to wrap cut flowers, or a waxed parchment envelope to hold fine powder. The target substance was gathered and secured in the conjured material. The container could be opened in the normal fashion or the caster could command it to open, which made the material disappear. The maximum amount of stuff that could be contained with this cantrip was a volume of {{SI|1|cu yd|long=yes}}.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster pantomimed folding something and spoke the general type of container desired.
