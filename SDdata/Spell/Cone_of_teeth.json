        "Effects": "This deadly spell created a rotating cone of water. The water on the edge of the cone took on the properties of [[shark]]'s teeth. A creature caught in the cone suffered extreme pain and damage. The size and strength of the cone depended on the caster's skill level.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]] in the form of a few teeth from a shark. The caster ate the teeth during casting."
