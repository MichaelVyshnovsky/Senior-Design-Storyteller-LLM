        "mainbody": "Cone of teeth was a common spell used by wizards in Ser√¥s.\nThis deadly spell created a rotating cone of water. The water on the edge of the cone took on the properties of sharks teeth. A creature caught in the cone suffered extreme pain and damage. The size and strength of the cone depended on the casters skill level.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component in the form of a few teeth from a shark. The caster ate the teeth during casting."
