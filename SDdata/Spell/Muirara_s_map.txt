Muiraras map was a divination wizard spell created by Muirara.
This spell allowed the caster to create a mental map depicting four lights in darkness. The four lights represented the caster, two places the caster has visited, and a chosen being.
This mental map provided the caster with a rough idea where the objects in question were and could be used to find any creature on the same plane of existence provided they were not concealing their location through magical or psionic means.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast.
