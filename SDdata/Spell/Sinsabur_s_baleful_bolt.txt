Sinsaburs baleful bolt was a necromancy spell that conjured a bolt of dark energy that enfeebled any creature caught within its path.
The bolt of energy shot forth from the casters fingertips and extended out for over 100 ft (30.5 m). It severely weakened any living being it struck and diminished their vitality. If they survived the spells effects, the victim slowly recovered from these effects over the course of days.
The casting of this spell required only verbal and somatic components.
