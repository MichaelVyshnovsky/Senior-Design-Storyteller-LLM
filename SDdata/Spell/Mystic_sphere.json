        "mainbody": "Mystic sphere was a spell that was first developed by the phaerimms.\nThis powerful spell protected the caster or a targeted creature from nearly all spells. When cast, the spell created a protective sphere around the recipient of the spell. This sphere was invisible and the caster was able to move it around at will, including through solid barriers such as the ground. A creature within the spheres interior was able to cast spells and use magical items normally. The sphere did not protect a creature within from normal physical attacks.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required several material components a regular stone, a tear from the caster, and a transparent gem with a value greater than 600 gp.\nThis spell was originally created by the phaerimms of Myth Drannor."
