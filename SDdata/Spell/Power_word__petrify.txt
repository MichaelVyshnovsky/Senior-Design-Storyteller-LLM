Power word, petrify, was an arcane spell from the enchantment school that could be cast by both sorcerers and wizards.
After the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, the spell was able to turn one creature to stone.
The spell only worked on creatures under a certain high degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the spellcaster.
The spell required only a verbal component, which was the uttering of the power word itself.
As of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, the spell was used by people in Rashemen and Samarach, and on the Dragon Coast and Sword Coast North.
