Symbol of pain was a necromancy spell that created a powerful rune that tortured one or more creatures when triggered.
This spell functioned similar to symbol of death except all creatures in the area of effect were wracked with pain that made performing any skill, using any ability, or engaging in combat very difficult. There was no practical limit on the number, size, or toughness of the creatures affected, and unless a creature had the fortitude to overcome the magic of this spell, the pain lasted for a full hour after a creature left the area of effect (a 60 ft/18.3 m radius from the symbol).
This symbol remained potent for 10 minutes per caster level. Any creature reentering the area of effect was again assaulted by pain unless they could muster the fortitude to resist it.
Symbols were difficult but not impossible to detect and disable before they were triggered. A brave and/or skilled rogue was required to get by this trap.
In addition to the verbal and somatic components, this spell required a drop of mercury, a bit of phosphorus, and a mixture of opal and diamond dust worth at least 1,000 gp.
