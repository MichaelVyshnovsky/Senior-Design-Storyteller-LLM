'''''Dethrone''''' was a powerful and extremely rare [[arcane]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] from the 5{{th}} circle of magic, possibly authored by [[Karsus]], the Momentary God{{Speculation}} before the [[Fall of Netheril]].

==Effects==
When the spell's words were uttered, a powerful magical force was unleash upon a single creature, shredding its very essence by pulling on the strands of the [[Weave]]. It resulted in a great amount of [[necrotic]] damage, however, the caster [[mage]] could only use the spell once per day and the spell was not empowered if the caster was powerful and experienced beyond the ability to cast magics of the 5{{th}} circle.

==History==
Two copies of the ''dethrone'' spell were stored deep within the magically sealed, trapped, and protected vaults of [[Ramazith's tower]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. The tower's master, [[Lorroakan]], kept them in the vault marked by the name of "Karsus", alongside other powerful [[enchanted]] items, including ''[[The Annals of Karsus]]'' â€“ the [[book]] that detailed the ''[[Regalia of Karsus]]'', a collection of powerful [[Netherese]] [[artifact]]s.
