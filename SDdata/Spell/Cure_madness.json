        "mainbody": "Cure madness was a divine abjuration spell from the necromantic sphere that removed the harmful effects of diseases that targeted the mind.\nIn order for the spells magic to work the priest needed to place their hands upon the targets brow. The negative effects of madness dissipated within several minutes to several days depending on the severity of the disease. This spell also worked to combat the feeblemind spell and the aftereffects of psionics that harmed the mind.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThis spell was only granted to followers of the elven goddess Sehanine Moonbow."
