'''''Air tread''''' was a spell used by [[cleric]]s of [[Vhaeraun]]. 

==Effects==
When cast, this spell changed the weight of the caster. The caster could cast this spell on another creature by touch. The altered weight made the caster or targeted creature light enough to walk on a liquid as if it were solid. Unlike ''[[water walk]]'', the feet of the caster or targeted creature made physical contact with the liquid. If the spell was cast on a creature who was falling, the spell halted their descent, however if falling from a great height, the spell only slowed their descent. 

The spell was commonly used to cross the chasms of the [[Underdark]] or to cross from one rooftop to another. A caster could cast another spell while ''air tread'' was in effect, but once the other spell was cast, the effects of ''air tread'' ended instantly.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, some dust, a feather and a sandal or shoe.
