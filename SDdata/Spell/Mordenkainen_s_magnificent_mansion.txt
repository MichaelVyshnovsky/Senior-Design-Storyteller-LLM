'''''Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion''''', sometimes known as simply '''''Mordenkainen's mansion''''',

==Effects==
The spell shaped a total volume in [[extradimensional space]] of up to 50,000 cubic feet (1400 cubic meters) into the interior of an exuberant mansion that lasted for 24 hours. The place could have any floor plan and any room arrangement specified by the caster. It was completely furnished and decorated in whatever way the caster wished.

The mansion was connected to the [[plane]] from which the spell was cast via a shimmering door 4‒5 feet (1.2‒1.5 meters) wide and 8‒10 feet (2.4‒3 meters) tall. Only individuals authorized by the caster could cross the door, which was invisible when closed.

The mansion's atmosphere was always fresh and clean, regardless of the conditions outside. It could provide enough food for a nine-course banquet that could feed up to 100 people. The mansion and all its guests were tended by a staff of 100 almost transparent servants, similar to visible versions of the [[unseen servant]] spell, whose appearance and garment were also chosen by the caster and who were completely obedient to the caster's commands. The servants were capable of performing any activity that a [[human]] servant was capable of, except attacking or harming anyone, and they were confined to the mansion's interior, along with all furnishings created by the spell.

If the mansion remained occupied beyond the spell's duration, all occupants were ejected from it through the door back to the original location.

The [[wizard]] [[Fistandia]] discovered a way to create a permanent ''magnificent mansion''. She scrawled her findings in the margins of ''[[The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces]]'', a tome discussing the spell.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The materials required were a miniature portal carved from [[ivory]], a small piece of polished [[marble]], and a tiny [[silver]] [[spoon]]. Each of these items needed to be worth at least 5 [[gp]].

The spell was one of many spells credited to the prolific [[Oerth]]ian [[wizard]] [[Mordenkainen]],

To [[Zakhara]]n mages, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''magnificient mansion''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].
