        "mainbody": "Elemental transmogrification was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell affected any item with ties to one of the four elements. Example Items connected to the element of sand included gems, metal, and glass.\nThe base area of effect for this spell was a 10 ft. (3.1 m) diameter circle. Casters with more command of magic were able to create much larger circles.\nThis spell transformed items connected to one element into an entirely different element. The new element was chosen by the caster. Elemental mages and Sorcerers could only select the elements they were devoted to. The effects of this spell were permanent. Items transformed in this manner were transported to the elemental plane of their new element one minute after being transformed.\nThis spell did not require physical components to cast."
