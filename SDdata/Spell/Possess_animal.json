        "mainbody": "Possess animal was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThis spell allowed a shugenja to project their spirit into an animal. It only worked on a natural animal, including giant animals. After possession was achieved, the shugenja was able to perform tasks, within the animals natural abilities. If the possessed animal was hurt, the shugenja absorbed some of the damage. If the possessed animal died, the shugenja had to be strong enough to withstand the shock to their system, or they died as well. While possessing an animal, the shugenjas body fell into a catatonic state. If they were disturbed while the spell was in effect, their soul was reunited with their body and the spell expired. After the creature was released, they had no memory of the possession.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components incense and a small figurine of the animal the shugenja wished to possess."
