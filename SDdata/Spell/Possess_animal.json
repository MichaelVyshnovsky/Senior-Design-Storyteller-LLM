        "mainbody": "'''''Possess animal''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed a shugenja to project their spirit into an animal. It only worked on a natural animal, including giant animals. After possession was achieved, the shugenja was able to perform tasks, within the animal's natural abilities. If the possessed animal was hurt, the shugenja absorbed some of the damage. If the possessed animal died, the shugenja had to be strong enough to withstand the shock to their system, or they died as well. While possessing an animal, the shugenja's body fell into a catatonic state. If they were disturbed while the spell was in effect, their soul was reunited with their body and the spell expired. After the creature was released, they had no memory of the possession.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: incense and a small figurine of the animal the shugenja wished to possess."
