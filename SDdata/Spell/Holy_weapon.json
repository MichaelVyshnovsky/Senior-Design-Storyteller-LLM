        "mainbody": "Holy weapon was a spell used by clerics and paladins to create a magical weapon. \nThis spell allowed a caster to temporarily bless a weapon and imbue it with magical powers. During the spell, the weapon became radiant and bright light emanated from it, illuminating an area of up to  in radius. At any point during the spells duration, the caster could dismiss the spell, which caused a brilliant burst of radiant light. As a result, creatures within  of the weapon were blinded for a short period. \nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
