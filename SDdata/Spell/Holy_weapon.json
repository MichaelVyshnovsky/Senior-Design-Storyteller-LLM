        "mainbody": "'''''Holy weapon''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s to create a magical weapon.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed a caster to temporarily bless a weapon and imbue it with magical powers. During the spell, the weapon became radiant and bright light emanated from it, illuminating an area of up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} in radius. At any point during the spell's duration, the caster could dismiss the spell, which caused a brilliant burst of radiant light. As a result, creatures within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the weapon were blinded for a short period.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components."
