The duration of the prayer was a few minutes and increased with the experience of the caster.\nIf the older version of this spell were cast when another priest of the same religion was casting chant, the effect of the chant was doubled.\nThe newer version of this spell required only the priests holy symbol or divine focus in addition to the verbal and somatic components to cast this spell. The older version specifically required a silver holy symbol, prayer beads, or similar religious accoutrement."
