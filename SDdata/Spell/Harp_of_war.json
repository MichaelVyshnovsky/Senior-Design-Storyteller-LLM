        "mainbody": "Harp of war was a powerful divine alteration and evocation spell used by priests devoted to Milil, enabling them to create a harp of glowing force.\nThe weightless magical harp created by this spell hung in the air near the caster, leaving them free to cast other spells if desired. The harp could only be played by the caster and each pluck of the strings triggered a power. The harp of war had the following powers\n* shatter nonmagical metal items within \n* teleport all magic items within  to a random location in Faer√ªn\n* shoot a lightning bolt at a single target\n* teleport without error targets selected by the caster within  to a desired location\n* unleash a flame strike on a single target within \nVariations in the harp of wars powers depended on the incantation. Each temple of Milil had their own unique versions of this spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a thin strand of silver wire  to cast."
