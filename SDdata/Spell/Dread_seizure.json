        "mainbody": "Entropic warding was a defensive warlock invocation designed to slow an opponent and weaken their attacks.\nWhen the spell was invoked, targeting a single creature within  from the caster, it exploded in pain within the targets muscles. The pain caused seizures, causing the creature to move slowly and rendering their attacks weaker and harder to land. The invocation lasted for around 35 seconds. Creatures of good fortitude could resist the spells effects."
