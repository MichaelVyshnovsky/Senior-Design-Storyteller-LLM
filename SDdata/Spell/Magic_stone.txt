Magic stone, also called magical stone, was a transmutation or enchantment spell that turned some nearby stones into projectiles.
Up to threeThe earliest version of this spell allowed the caster to enchant one stone for every five experience levels. See page 33 of the Unearthed Arcana 1st edition sourcebook. small stones no larger than sling bullets could be enchanted to become magical projectiles that could be used in a ranged attack. The dweomer lasted 30 minutes before the pebbles reverted back to normal. Whomever used the stones had to make a normal range attack, either by throwing or slinging, but with the added bonus due to the magic on the stones, it was a bit easier and worked on targets that only magic weapons could strike. The transmuted bullets were particularly effective against undead, potentially doing double damage.
Verbal and somatic components and the casters holy symbol or divine focus were required, plus the three stones. The enchantment version of this spell required the pebbles be untouched by tool or magic as a prerequisite.
