'''''Magic stone''''', also called '''''magical stone''''', was a [[transmutation]] or [[enchantment]] spell that turned some nearby stones into projectiles.

==Effects==
Up to three<ref group="note">The earliest version of this spell allowed the caster to enchant one stone for every five experience levels. See page 33 of the [[Unearthed Arcana 1st edition]] sourcebook. small stones no larger than sling bullets could be enchanted to become magical projectiles that could be used in a ranged attack. The dweomer lasted 30 minutes before the pebbles reverted back to normal. Whomever used the stones had to make a normal range attack, either by throwing or slinging, but with the added bonus due to the magic on the stones, it was a bit easier and worked on targets that only magic weapons could strike. The transmuted bullets were particularly effective against [[undead]], potentially doing double damage.

==Components==
Verbal and somatic components and the caster's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]] were required, plus the three stones. The enchantment version of this spell required the pebbles be untouched by tool or magic as a prerequisite.
