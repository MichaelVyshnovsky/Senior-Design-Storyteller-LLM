        "mainbody": "Lower resistance was an uncommon abjuration/alteration spell that allowed the caster to reduce the magical resistances of a single target.\nThe spell attempted to strip a single creature of some of its magic resistance. The subjects magic resistance still worked against the spell itself, but only at half its regular potency. If the target creature had no magic resistance, it did not make it more susceptible to magic, essentially voiding the spell. The more experienced the caster was, the more magic resistance was stripped. More powerful casters could make the spells effects last for far longer.\nVerbal, somatic, and material components were needed to cast the spell. The single material component was a broken iron rod.\nIn 840 DR, Sammaster made significant discoveries in the field of metamagic, leading to a several new spells, including lower resistance."
