Fizbans platinum shield was a spell used by sorcerers, and wizards to protect themselves and others. 
This spell surrounded the caster, or a person of their choice, in an aura of silver light that acted as cover and protected from acid, cold, fire, lightning, and poison damage. The aura also allowed a person to move quicker. 
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was a dragon scale that had been coated in platinum, which must be worth at least 500 gp.
