'''''Stinking cloud''''', originally called '''''Tolodine's stinking cloud''''',

==Effects==
The green cloud created by this spell had a {{SIAdj|20|ft}} radius and was equally high. It could be formed anywhere within medium range. Creatures breathing in its fumes felt sick to the stomach. The cloud lasted for up to one minute, for as long as the caster kept concentrating on maintaining the spell.

The effects of a ''stinking cloud'' could also be obtained as a possible effect of a ''[[guards and wards]]'' spell.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s which were consumed in the casting process. When this spell was magically inscribed unto a scroll, [[ink]] made from yochlol essence{{Cite dragon/260/Greater Drakes|36}} was often used.

It was also possible to use the gland found in [[flumph]]s that produced their defensive foul-smelling liquid as a [[material component]] for the spell. However, if cast using that gland, the spell was likely to attract the attention of every flumph within a {{SIAdj|1|mi|k}} radius.{{Cite dragon/246/The Ecology of the Flumph|78}}

==History==
This spell and the similar ''[[death fog]]'' spell were invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Tolodine]] in {{Yearlink|-2363}}, early in the history of [[Netheril]].

[[Zaranda Star]] used the spell during her raid of [[Castle Lutwill]] during the {{YearlinkName|1366}}.
