'''''Finding the center''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was rare outside Kara-Tur. It was a more powerful version of ''[[aiming at the target]]''. 

==Effects==
The spell enabled a wu jen to keep concentrating on any one action, such as maintaining another spell, regardless of any other distracting action they undertook, by greatly boosting their ability to concentrate. Casting this spell was swift, even instantaneous, and it did not even interrupt concentration on an existing spell.

The wu jen's concentration could not be broken unless the spell expired, or the wu jen was killed. Some spells such as ''[[enfeeble]]'' or ''[[confusion]]'' were able to disrupt the spell and break the wu jen's concentration. 

==Components==
The spell required only [[somatic component|somatic]] components. To cast it, the wu jen performed precisely controlled breathing exercises to calm and clear their mind, which released the energy of the spell.
