'''''Spider summoning''''' was a spell used by priestesses of [[Lolth]]. 

==Effects==
When cast, this spell summoned several large [[spider]]s around the caster. The number of spiders was determined by the caster's spell level. They appeared out of thin air within {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} of the caster. Utterly loyal to the caster, they obeyed the caster's mental commands and fought to the death if necessary. 

While the spell was in effect, the caster was free to cast other spells. Once the spell expired, the spiders vanished, returning to where they were summoned from. The spell was only able to summon natural arachnids. It was unable to summon spider-like creatures nor creatures who used magic to take the form of a spider. It also could only control the spiders that were summoned by the spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], a dehydrated spider.
