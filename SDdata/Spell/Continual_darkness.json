        "mainbody": "'''''Continual darkness''''' was an [[alteration]] spell that created an area of perpetual darkness impermeable to normal light.",
        "Effects": "The effects of this spell were similar to ''[[darkness]]'', creating an area of no light up to 120 ft (36.6 m) away surrounding a central point out to a 60 ft (18.3 m) radius. It could be cast at a point in the air, onto an object, or possibly a creature. If successfully cast on the visual organs of a creature, it was effectively blinded. The spell was permanent until dispelled by the caster, a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell, or an equal or stronger ''[[light]]'' spell was cast on it.\n\nThe [[illusionist]] version of this spell had half the range and half the radius of the [[divine magic|divine]] version, and was not reversible (although they were able to cast a separate ''[[continual light]]'' spell).\n\n''Continual darkness'' countered ''light'' spells of equal or lesser power, and vice versa.\n\nThis spell eventually consumed the material it was cast upon, but dense, hard, or expensive materials (like [[gem]]s) could last hundreds to thousands of years.\n\n[[Sinhala]] stones were known to prevent magical darkness.",
        "Components": "The divine version of this spell only required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components to cast. The [[material component]] was the substance it was cast upon: air, an object, a structure, or a creature. For the illusionist version, a tuft of [[bat]] fur and either a drop of [[pitch]] or a small chunk of [[coal]] was needed in addition to verbal and somatic components.",
        "History": "The reverse of this spell, ''[[continual light]]'', was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Polybeus]] in {{Yearlink|-1164}} and was originally called ''Polybeus's illumination''."
