        "mainbody": "'''''Find humanoid familiar''''' was a [[spell]] that could only be cast by [[dragon]]s. It was nearly identical to the ''[[find familiar]]'' spell.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed a dragon to charm a [[humanoid]] into becoming its [[familiar]]. The targeted individual was overcome with unbreakable loyalty to the dragon, even to the point of giving its life for its master. The dragon and familiar shared a telepathic bond, allowing for two-way communication to a distance of {{SI|5|mi|k}}. The dragon was unable to use the senses of the familiar and suffered no harm if the familiar was killed. The spell could only be cast on [[goblinoid]]s, [[kobold]]s, or [[orc]]s. A dragon killing its spellbound familiar was considered such a strong taboo that the dragon risked incurring the wrath of one of more [[deity|deities]].",
        "Casting": "This spell required only a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component. Casting the spell required the dragon's full concentration and could take up to twenty hours to cast, the dragon chanting the verbal component the whole time. The spell was not guaranteed to find a familiar, and the dragon could only cast this spell once a year."
