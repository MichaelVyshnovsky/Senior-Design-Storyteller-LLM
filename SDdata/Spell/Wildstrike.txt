'''''Wildstrike''''' was a [[wild magic]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[wild mage]]s.

==Effects==
This spell converted spell energy into [[wild surge]]s, making it particularly useful against enemy spellcasters. ''Wildstrike'' surrounded the target with a field of wild magic. Any attempt by the target to cast a spell or use a [[magic item]] would result in a wild surge.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a small [[glass tubing|glass tube]] to cast. The glass tube was shattered during the casting.
