They whipped around the air making unsettling moans and howling sounds.\nThe duration of this spell did not end prematurely and its area-of-effect could not be moved however, its effects could be dispelled. They were non-harmful to the caster.\nWailing whips was one of the spells whose specifications could be found within the Lash of Loviatar.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast."
