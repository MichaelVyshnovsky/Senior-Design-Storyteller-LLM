        "mainbody": "'''''Wailing whips''''' was a [[divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] that conjured a number of spectral [[whip]]s for a short duration.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell created several floating whips, made of pure force energy, that lashed out in an area with a 30-foot diameter (9.1 meters). They whipped around the air making unsettling moans and howling sounds.\n\nThe duration of this spell did not end prematurely and its area-of-effect could not be moved; however, its effects could be ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]''. They were non-harmful to the caster.",
        "History": "''Wailing whips'' was one of the spells whose specifications could be found within the ''[[Lash of Loviatar]]''.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast."
