        "mainbody": "'''''Crown of brilliance''''' was a powerful [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by [[Celestial archon|archons]] who could cast [[divine magic]].\n\nWhile usually reserved for archons, [[Mystra]] might also grant this spell to mortals who had been blessed by one of the [[Seven Sisters]].",
        "Effects": "At the completion of the casting of this spell, a halo of golden light surrounded the caster's head and emanated out twenty feet (six meters) in all directions. The light was intense enough to dazzle any creatures in the area, even blinding some of them for up to nearly half a minute. Creatures sensitive to light were forced to leave the area, and [[undead]] creatures took physical damage from the brilliant radiance.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, casting ''crown of brilliance'' required the caster to carry an expensive [[opal]] for the duration of the spell. The opal shattered at the end of the spell, and likewise, the spell ended if the opal was lost or destroyed."
