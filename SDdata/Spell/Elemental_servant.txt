'''''Elemental servant''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]]. The spell was very rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
The spell allowed a wu jen to call an [[elemental]] and forced it into servitude to complete a task. The task was required to be in the domain of the summoned elemental; for example, a [[water elemental]] would not perform a service that involved [[fire]]. If the elemental was strong enough, it could ignore the wu jen's summons and the spell would subsequently fail. If successful, the elemental was compelled to complete its assigned task.

Once the task was completed, the elemental instantly returned to its plane of existence. Since elementals resented being summoned and compelled into servitude, a wise wu jen used this spell sparingly, else they became the target of revenge on the part of a scorned elemental.

A wu jen was unable to cast this spell in the [[phlogiston]].

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: a piece of [[paper]] with the exact details of the required task written on it, and a large amount of the appropriate element.
