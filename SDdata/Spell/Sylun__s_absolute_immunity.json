This spell was created by [[Syluné Silverhand]].",
        "Effects": "This spell completely protected the caster from one particular spell for days at a time depending on the skill of the caster. Additionally, ''absolute immunity'' granted an extra degree of resistance to other spells similar to the selected spell.\n\nThe caster could only be protected by one ''absolute immunity'' spell at a time. The second casting of ''absolute immunity'' would replace the selected spell with the new one, or extend the duration of the spell if it was the same as the first selection.",
        "Components": "This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast."
