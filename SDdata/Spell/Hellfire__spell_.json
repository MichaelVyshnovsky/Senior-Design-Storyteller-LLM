        "mainbody": "Hellfire was an evocation spell.\nBy casting hellfire, the caster caused an explosion with a radius of 10 foot (3 meters) of brimstone and fire. This fire bypassed every kind of magical and other defenses against fire.\nHellfire required only verbal and somatic components.\nHellfire was a spell that was only available to people who had access to the Diabolic domain."
