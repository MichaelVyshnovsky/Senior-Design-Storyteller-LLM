Axe storm of Clangeddin was a spell used by clerics of Clanggedin Silverbeard.
When cast, this spell increased an axe-wielding dwarfs skill in melee combat. Their strikes were faster and more powerful, and axes thrown at a target never missed. The amount of individuals this spell affected was based on the casters skill level. This spell was not cumulative, and slow cancelled out the effects of the spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Clanggedin Silverbeard and a small vial of air that was capped during a thunderstorm.
