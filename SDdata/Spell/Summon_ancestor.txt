Summon ancestor was a divine necromancy spell used by specialty priests devoted to Uthgar, enabling them to call forth a deceased ancestor.
Shamans of Uthgar used this spell on the burial mounds of their tribe which was the only place the spell would function.
This spell called forth a deceased ancestor from a tribes burial mound. The ancestor assumed the form of a transparent combination a totem beast and their human form. Normal spirits could also be called forth but could not travel more than  from the burial mound. Once the spirit was summoned the shaman attempted to gain control of it, otherwise the spirt would behave like a vengeful ghost. The ghost was still not able to move more than  from the burial mound.
Controlled spirits were able to attack enemies, as ghosts, guard the ancestor mound for a full year, reveal ancient secrets, initiate a new shaman, and raise the dead.
In addition to verbal components and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol, a small bonfire, and a relic of the ancestor to cast.
