'''''Summon ancestor''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Uthgar]], enabling them to call forth a deceased ancestor.

[[Shaman]]s of Uthgar used this spell on the burial mounds of their tribe which was the only place the spell would function.

==Effects==
This spell called forth a deceased ancestor from a tribe's burial mound. The ancestor assumed the form of a transparent combination a totem beast and their human form. Normal spirits could also be called forth but could not travel more than {{SI|50|ft}} from the burial mound. Once the spirit was summoned the shaman attempted to gain control of it, otherwise the spirt would behave like a vengeful [[ghost]]. The ghost was still not able to move more than {{SI|50|ft}} from the burial mound.

Controlled spirits were able to attack enemies, as ghosts, guard the ancestor mound for a full year, reveal ancient secrets, initiate a new shaman, and raise the dead.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component]]s and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]], a small bonfire, and a relic of the ancestor to cast.
