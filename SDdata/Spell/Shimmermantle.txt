Shimmmermantle was an arcane abjuration spell that shielded its caster in a shimmering protective aura.
The protective aura moved with the caster, and could cause a wide array of both physical and magical attacks (such as spells, spell-like abilities, or other harmful magical effects) to miss the caster, including attacks not meant to cause any direct harm. Shimmermantle lasted up to ten minutes, but would expire early once it deflected a certain amount of attacks, the exact amount of which depended on the casters relative strength in the Art.
While affected by shimmermantle, a caster could still use other spells and magic items as normal. There were two exceptions magic missiles were absorbed by the aura no matter which way they passed, and all lightning magic was negated altogether.
A caster could be affected by other magical protections concurrently with shimmermantle, provided these did not negate magic.
Improved shimmermantle was a slightly more powerful version of this spell.
This spell required only the verbal component to cast.
Shimmermantle was a modification of a spell used by human wizards in Neverwinter circa the 14 century DR.
* Shimmermantle was one of the many spells found in the emerald dragon Raulothims vast collection.
