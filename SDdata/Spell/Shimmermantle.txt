'''''Shimmmermantle''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that shielded its caster in a shimmering protective aura.

==Effects==
The protective aura moved with the caster, and could cause a wide array of both physical and [[magic]]al attacks (such as spells, spell-like abilities, or other harmful magical effects) to miss the caster, including attacks not meant to cause any direct harm. ''Shimmermantle'' lasted up to ten minutes, but would expire early once it deflected a certain amount of attacks, the exact amount of which depended on the caster's relative strength in the Art.

While affected by ''shimmermantle'', a caster could still use other spells and magic items as normal. There were two exceptions: ''[[magic missile]]s'' were absorbed by the aura no matter which way they passed, and all lightning magic was negated altogether.

A caster could be affected by other magical protections concurrently with ''shimmermantle'', provided these did not negate magic.

''[[Improved shimmermantle]]'' was a slightly more powerful version of this spell.

==Components==
This spell required only the [[verbal component]] to cast.

==History==
''Shimmermantle'' was a modification of a spell used by [[human]] [[wizard]]s in [[Neverwinter]] ''circa'' the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Known Users==
* ''Shimmermantle'' was one of the many spells found in the [[emerald dragon]] [[Raulothim]]'s vast collection.
