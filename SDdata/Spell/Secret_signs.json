        "mainbody": "Secret signs was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur used to communicate non-verbally. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThis spell allowed a wu jen to covertly communicate with another individual. The individual had to be within the sight and hearing range of the wu jen. This spell only allowed for short communications of up to 25 words. These words were communicated by a gesture or a glance. The targeted individual was not required to be fluent in the wu jens language. This spell could not act as a trigger for another spell.\nThis spell required only a somatic component."
