        "mainbody": "'''''Firefinger''''' was a personal [[cantrip]] that apprentice [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It caused a flame to be emitted from the tip of the caster's finger.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip produced a flame up to {{SI|6|in|c|long=yes}} long that lasted for six seconds. It was hot enough to start a fire in kindling, burn parchment, and ignite other combustible materials provided they were mostly dry and in conditions conducive to fire. The caster's finger was not harmed by the flame, but it was not a good idea to cast this spell with a hand in a pocket.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The forefinger was extended and then the thumb of the same hand was flicked across it in a sideways motion while the caster spoke a word associated with control of elemental [[fire]], such as ''dun-hill'', ''ron-son'', or ''zip-po''.Dunhill, Ronson, and Zippo were all popular brands of cigarette lighters.",
        "History": "In the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} [[Simon Aumar]] demonstrated a ''firefinger'' cantrip at his magic show in the [[Triboar playhouse|playhouse]] in [[Triboar]], but impressed precisely no one.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} He had more effect later when he used it to ignite [[Themberchaud]]'s gassy belches, and triggered an explosion that released him and his fellow adventurers."
