        "mainbody": "Firefinger was a personal cantrip that apprentice wizards could learn. It caused a flame to be emitted from the tip of the casters finger.\nThis cantrip produced a flame up to  long that lasted for six seconds. It was hot enough to start a fire in kindling, burn parchment, and ignite other combustible materials provided they were mostly dry and in conditions conducive to fire. The casters finger was not harmed by the flame, but it was not a good idea to cast this spell with a hand in a pocket.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components to cast. The forefinger was extended and then the thumb of the same hand was flicked across it in a sideways motion while the caster spoke a word associated with control of elemental fire, such as dun-hill, ron-son, or zip-po.Dunhill, Ronson, and Zippo were all popular brands of cigarette lighters.\nIn the late 1490s DR, Simon Aumar demonstrated a firefinger cantrip at his magic show in the playhouse in Triboar, but impressed precisely no one. He had more effect later when he used it to ignite Themberchauds gassy belches, and triggered an explosion that released him and his fellow adventurers."
