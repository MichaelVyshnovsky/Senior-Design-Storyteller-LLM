        "mainbody": "Elemental servant was a common spell used by wu jen. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThe spell allowed a wu jen to call an elemental and forced it into servitude to complete a task. The task was required to be in the domain of the summoned elemental for example, a water elemental would not perform a service that involved fire. If the elemental was strong enough, it could ignore the wu jens summons and the spell would subsequently fail. If successful, the elemental was compelled to complete its assigned task.\nOnce the task was completed, the elemental instantly returned to its plane of existence. Since elementals resented being summoned and compelled into servitude, a wise wu jen used this spell sparingly, else they became the target of revenge on the part of a scorned elemental.\nA wu jen was unable to cast this spell in the phlogiston.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components a piece of paper with the exact details of the required task written on it, and a large amount of the appropriate element."
