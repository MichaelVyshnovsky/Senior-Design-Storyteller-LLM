'''''Weirdshield''''' was a [[spell]] that was first developed by the [[phaerimm]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a powerful magical barrier in a location of the caster's choosing. This barrier was triangular in shape and had tentacles along the edge, each with a humanoid hand at the end. Once cast, the caster was able to move the barrier. Swords created from magic, including ''[[sword of dancing|swords of dancing]]'' within {{SI|60|ft}} were instantly drawn to this barrier, which then destroyed them. When the barrier was within {{SI|20|ft}} of the caster, it protected them from magical attacks, reflecting the spell back to the creature who cast it. The barrier was able to block incorporeal creatures. It was also immune to all physical attacks and nearly all magical attacks. If this barrier came into contact with another type of barrier spell, both spells instantly expired. The only other way the spell could be defeated was either by a ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', or ''[[wish]]'' spell, or if the caster was killed. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required several [[material component]]s: the caster's saliva, a small shield, and an arm.

==History==
This spell was originally created by the [[phaerimm]]s of [[Myth Drannor]].
