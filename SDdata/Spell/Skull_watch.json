        "mainbody": "Skull Watch was a necromantic ritual that existed during the post-Spellplague era, which could turn any skull into a silent intruder alarm.\nFor a duration of 4 hours any skull enchanted by Skull Watch would mentally alert its enchanter, if within  of them, when they detected an intruder. Skulls could only detect visually, not audibly or through smell, and destruction of the skull would not trigger an alert. For the duration of the ritual the caster could at any time view through the eye-sockets of the skull, though would not have use of their own eyesight while doing so.\nThe enchantment process took around 10 minutes to complete. During this time the caster could also designate one or more individuals or categories of creatures for the skull to not recognize as intruders, the latter including such things as creatures of a certain type, a certain race, or creatures wielding certain equipment.\nCasting this ritual required material components costing around 80 gold pieces on average, with the most important component being a skull.\nAround the late 15 century DR, a human necromancer was operating in Tymanther, in an ancient Untheri burial site near Ruinspoke. The necromancer made their lair within the depths of a mauseoleum and placed within its entrance level a human skull enchanted with Skull Watch to guard against intruders.It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or Tymanchebar. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of \"the old Untheric Empire\" and the presence of a Lathanderite sarcophagus in the mausoleum, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther. This skull would alert him to the presence of the dwarf Melnar, a member of the Gem Assayers Union, snooping about the ruins. Some time after having had his undead minions drag the dwarf down into his lair, a group of adventurers were hired by Dirnth, another member of the Gem Assayers Union, to find him. They eventually ventured into the mausoleum in search of him, where they were either spotted by the skull or managed to evade it before it could alert the necromancer of their presence."
