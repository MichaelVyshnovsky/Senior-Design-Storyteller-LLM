        "Effects": "By touching an opponent, a druid casting this spell would cause an infestation of maggot-like creatures to cover the target creature. These maggots would slowly drain one's constitution unless resisted or removed by a ''[[remove disease]]'' or ''[[heal]]'' spell. Otherwise, they would naturally die off once the duration of the spell ended.",
        "Components": "Unlike most druidic spells, this spell required a handful of dessicated flies as a [[material component]], in addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
