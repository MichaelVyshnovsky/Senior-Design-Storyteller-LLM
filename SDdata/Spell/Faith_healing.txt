Faith healing was a healing spell.
A caster used this spell to heal another creature. After casting, the caster touched a targeted creature, who then was healed due to the flow of positive energy from the spell. The spell only functioned if the creature worshiped the same patron as the caster.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
