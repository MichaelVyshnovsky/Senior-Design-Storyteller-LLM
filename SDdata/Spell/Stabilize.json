        "mainbody": "Stabilize was a wild magic abjuration spell used by wild mages.\nThis spell negated the chaotic effects within wild magic regions. With the casters immense concentration during casting, stabilize allowed the caster and all creatures within  to use magic normally without fear of triggering a wild surge. The safe area followed the caster if they moved around. Furthermore, a wild surge triggered outside of range of this spell would not pass into the safe area.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
