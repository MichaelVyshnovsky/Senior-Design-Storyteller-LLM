Just not there was an arcane abjuration spell developed by the amethyst dragon Eldenser, the Lurker, to hide himself from magical detection.
The spell applied specifically to Eldenser, any blade he touched or occupied via the steelsteal spell, and any creature under the effect of stealsteel whom Eldenser was touching. It served to completely conceal him from all known magical detections, divinations, and other spells of contacting and seeking. It erased all magical sign of the presence of Eldenser or of a dragon, intelligent being, or anything unusual, rendering him, as the name said, "just not there". Psionics was largely unaffected, though powers that mimicked common detection and divination spells were thwarted. Just not there did not guard against general attacks against the area, but it protect against magic that required one to see or detect the hidden target.
The spell lasted twelve days, but could be bypassed if Eldenser wished to be found.
It required only a verbal component.
Eldenser once taught Khelben Arunsun just not there, steelsteal, and bright and deadly ring in exchange for other magic.
Eldensers rival dragons, Red Wizards of Thay, and the Cult of the Dragon all coveted these spells in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
