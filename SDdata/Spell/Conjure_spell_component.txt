'''''Conjure spell component''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
With this spell a wizard was able to teleport naturally occurring spell components directly to their hand so long as they were within several miles of the caster. Items found underground or underwater at a depth of more than {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} could not be teleported using this spell. The spell would also fail to teleport objects with a value higher than a single [[gold]] coin. Caster's with more skill could teleport more than one spell component, including those of different types.

==Components==
As one might expect, this spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.

==Notable Users==
* [[Mijel Morigan]], a wizard who operated [[Morrigan's Complete Components]] in Ravens Bluff.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/75/The Living City: Eye Of Newt and Food For Familiars|7}}
