Conjure spell component was a conjuration spell used by wizards.
With this spell a wizard was able to teleport naturally occurring spell components directly to their hand so long as they were within several miles of the caster. Items found underground or underwater at a depth of more than  could not be teleported using this spell. The spell would also fail to teleport objects with a value higher than a single gold coin. Casters with more skill could teleport more than one spell component, including those of different types.
As one might expect, this spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
