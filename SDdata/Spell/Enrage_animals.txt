Enrage animals was an enchantment spell that instilled uncontrolled rage into an animal.
On casting enrage animals, the caster chose an area and animals within this area were then affected. These animals grew highly aggressive and started attacking whatever creature was nearest it was entirely possible for an affected animal to attack another affected animal that happened to be nearby. It was very easy to provoke such behavior from a normal wild animal, but a dire animal and/or one that underwent training to attack on order was hard to enchant with this spell and it was possible for such animals to resist the spell.
Enrage animals required somatic and verbal components.
