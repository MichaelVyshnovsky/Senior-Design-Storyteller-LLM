'''''Chain contingency''''' was an uncommon and very powerful [[evocation]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to store up to three spells, which were immediately cast under a certain condition.

==Effects==
In order for the spell to function, it had to be cast together with the (two or three) spells that the [[mage]] wished to be stored. The stored spells had to be less powerful than the ''chain contingency'' spell itself. When the conditions were met, two spells were cast simultaneously, or three spells one after another.

Unlike the less-powerful ''[[contingency]]'' spell, the spells stored could affect targets other than the mage. However, the spell itself could only affect the caster.

''Chain contingency'' was normally prepared in advance, as the chained spells would be cast automatically, so the mage had time to cast other spells. Only a single one of these spells could be in effect at a single time, and if another ''chain contingency'' was cast, it would replace the last one. Interestingly, a single mage could have both a ''chain contingency'' and a ''contingency'' spell active simultaneously, but the conditions could not coincide. The duration of the spell increased with the power of the caster, and lasted for a single day at minimum.

==Components==
The spell required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s. The material components were a [[gem]] worth 1000 [[gp]] or more, 500 [[gp]] worth of [[quicksilver]], and an eyelash of a powerful spellcasting creature, such as a [[ki-rin]] or an [[oni mage]]. A statuette of the mage, which must be carved from [[ivory]], also had to be carried by the caster. In addition to these, the stored spells also required their specific material components.

==History==
''Chain contingency'' was used throughout [[Toril]], from powerful wizards in [[Faerûn]], to [[sha'ir]] in [[Zakhara]].

In the early–10{{th}} century [[DR]], the extremely powerful [[human]] mage, [[Sammaster]], prepared for [[lich]]dom in case his regenerative powers failed to function. He did this by casting both ''chain contingency'' and ''contingency'' on himself. As such, when he was killed, he moved to his [[phylactery]] by use of the multiple spells he had stored.
