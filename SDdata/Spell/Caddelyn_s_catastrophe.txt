Caddelyns catastrophe was a variation of the spell fumble, developed by the mage Caddelyn, that affected up to four creatures.
The spell could have a number of effects the targets would either fall and drop all their belongings, trip and stumble, or fail if they were in the middle of spellcasting.
The material components for this spell were a banana peel or a melon rind, and a candle made from tallow or a simple lump of animal fat.
This spell was originally inscribed in the Caddelyns personal spellbook.
