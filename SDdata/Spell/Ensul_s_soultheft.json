        "mainbody": "Ensuls soultheft was a necromancy spell that imbued the casters left hand with a malevolent dark energy that allowed them to devastate the mind of any creature or person they touched and steal the life force.\nWhen cast, the casters left hand was surrounded with crackling black illumination. If they struck another being with the hand, the caster permanently drained them of their intellect. When this malevolent attack was successful, the caster was healed of any wounds they had incurred, and any poisons or toxins in their body were cleansed.\nIf the caster killed someone while attacking them in this manner, they could not be resurrected or otherwise raised, unless these actions were made in conjunction with the spells wish or limited wish.\nThis duration of this spell was a number of seconds, but extended longer depending on the skill and experience of the caster.\nCommon practice saw soultheft being used on restrained beings, so that the caster maximize the amount of time they extended their life.\nThe Netherese sorcerer Telbran Nelarn used this spell to extended his life for centuries, regularly trapping and killing evil spellcasters he believed that were praying upon the innocent.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a single drop of vampire blood."
