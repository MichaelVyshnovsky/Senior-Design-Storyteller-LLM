'''''Friends''''' was an arcane [[enchantment]] spell that could influence the mood of a creature in favor of the caster.

==Effects==
While the caster concentrated, for up to one minute, the target creature became more inclined to believe, be persuaded or otherwise influenced by the caster. Once the effect of the spell wore off, the target creature immediately realized that magic was used to influence its mood, and could react violently.

Older versions of the ''friends'' spell were unable to affect creatures that had an animal level of intellect or lower.

==Components==
The spell needed [[somatic]] and [[material component]]s. As the material component, a bit of [[makeup]] was applied to the caster's face, Older versions of the spell instead required the caster to apply a combination of [[chalk]], [[lampblack]], and [[vermillion]] to their face. Alternatively, casters could substitute the chalk with white [[flour]] and the lampblack with soot.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Keonid]] in {{Yearlink|-1890}} and was originally known as ''Keonid's friendship''.
