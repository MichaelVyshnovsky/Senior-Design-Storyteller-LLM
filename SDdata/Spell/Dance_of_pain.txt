Dance of pain was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Loviatar, enabling them to summon illusory blades around an injured target.
This spell summoned illusory blades around a target injured within the past day.  The spell would not function on a healthy target. The blades whirled rapidly around the target in a spiral, jostling them about with a frantic dance that made it impossible for the target to perform any intricate tasks while also slicing into their flesh.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
