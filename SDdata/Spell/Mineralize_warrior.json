Outward signs of these changed were that the subject looked like a petrified version of him or herself.\nThe subject then experienced some form of mental need to serve the caster for one year and one day. After this period of servitude, the subject was free to do whatever it wanted on its own. A caster could not create an army of mineral warriors to do its bidding, because there was a limit to how many mineral warrior servants a caster could have. This number decreased with the strength of the targets and increased with the spellcasting skill of the caster. Breaching this limit caused previously servile mineral warriors to lose their compulsion to serve the caster. However, the caster had control over whom to release and who not.\nMineralize warrior required somatic, verbal, and material components, but also the casters own essence to cast. The material components were gems and other minerals. These stones collective value needed to cast mineralize warrior increased with the targets strength.
