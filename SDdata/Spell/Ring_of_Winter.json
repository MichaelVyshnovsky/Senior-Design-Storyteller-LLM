        "mainbody": "The Ring of Winter was a powerful magical ring with numerous magical capabilities.\nThe ring was a golden featureless band that was constantly covered in a layer of frost that never melted. It was extremely cold to the touch and could numb the hand of its wearer. It did not seem cold to someone who had been attuned to it, however.\nThe ring made it impossible for the wearer to be detected through divination magic, rendered its wearer immune to cold, and halted aging entirely. It also constantly attempted to take control of its wearer to compel them to cause unnecessary harm and destruction.\nThe ring furthermore increased the efficacy of all other magical items that remained within  of it for more than ten days. The longer the exposure, greater the augmentation.\nThe ring was capable of quickly and permanently lowering the temperature of a  radius sphere to a minimum of , and could do this multiple times until the wearer decided to end the effect. It could create inanimate objects and animated creatures made of ice. It was also capable of casting the spells Bigbys hand, cone of cold, an icy variant of flesh to stone, ice storm, Otilukes freezing sphere, sleet storm, spike growth, and wall of ice. The energy spent by the ring to do any of these effects was regained daily at dawn.\nLittle is known about the true origin of the ring. Gleaned from ancient history the ring was created during the time when the countries of the Realms were little more than scattered villages. It was forged by a powerful mage, that some say was Azuth before he became a god, and was kissed by Auril, the goddess of winter.\nIn the , the Ring of Winter was in Cormyr, where its magic called forth an unseasonal storm of ice in the middle of summer. So tremendous were its powers that it destroyed an entire village, as well as the home of a Cormyrean nobleman. At the time, Cormanthyran elves recognized the Ring of Winter for what it was, and regretted not having stepped in to edify its wielder before the Ring had had its chance to kill and destroy.\nNearly 500 years after, in 650 DR, this was still the last sighting of the Ring itself on the mainland of Faer√ªn.\nBefore 1362 DR, the ring had been hidden within the Temple of Ubtao in the lost city of Mezro, hidden there by the bara, Dhalmass Rayburton of Cormyr, after he had used the ring and thereby accidentally murdered several people. The former Harper, Artus Cimber, after spending years of his life searching for the ring, learned of the location of the ring and retrieved it, thereafter using it to repel a goblin invasion of Mezro.\nAt some point after the War of the Silver Marches of 1485 DR, the ring was relentlessly sought after by the frost giant, Jarl Storvald, as he believed it to be a way to raise frost giants in the ordning. The Zhentarim were also looking for the ring around the same time, and Nilraun Dhaerlost informed Jarl Storvald that the ring was in the possession of Artus Cimber. The frost giants used a blod stone to locate Artus Cimber through his blood, but were instead drawn to his son Sirac in Bryn Shander. The leader of the raiding party, Drufi, then attacked the city with twelve frost giants following this incorrect lead, but their attack was thwarted by the citys inhabitants, with the help of adventurers.\nAfter their failed attack on Bryn Shander, Drufi and her fellow giants journeyed to the jungles of Chult to search for Artus Cimber there, causing much confusion among the local rulers.\nAround the same time, the half-elven sorceress Xandala journeyed to Port Nyanzaru in search of Cimber, seeking to wrest the ring from him. To this end, Xandala attempted to manipulate a party of adventurers by claiming to be Cimbers lost daughter.\nIt was said that the ring had other powers that could only be accessed by an evil being who did not fall under control of the ring. It was rumored that the ring could be used to summon white dragons, or the primordial Cryonax, and freeze entire worlds.\nIt was said that the ring could only be destroyed if worn by the Summer Queen.\n* Dhalmass Rayburton, found the ring within the Dalelands and eventually brought it to Chult.\n* Tfima, momentarily had ownership of the ring before he hid it within the Temple of Ubtao.\n* Artus Cimber, was in possession of the ring ever since he retrieved it from Mezro."
