The caster was able to target a single creature or multiple at once. The number of arcs created was determined by the caster's skill level. The caster was only able to direct a single arc to each target creature.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: a rod made of glass and a piece of fur.
