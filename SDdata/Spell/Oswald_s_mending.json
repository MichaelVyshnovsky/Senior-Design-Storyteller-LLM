        "mainbody": "swalds mending was a special spell created by the gnomish inventor Oswald Fiddlebender and his niece, Maralie, sometime before 1312 DR.\nThe spell was used to repair Oswalds flying ship magically. Once all components were prepared, and the incantations were voiced, the magics slowly worked, mending the damage over a period of several days. The material components included freshly collected spidersilk a bottle of thrym extract collected from a remorhaz a belladonna plant, which turned into a paste when exposed to thrym some iron ore, usually substituted by an iron weapon two diamonds and several planks of wood.\nThe eccentric and bumbling potion maker and inventor Oswald Fiddlebender collected and developed numerous spells that he kept in a number of loosely bound messy books. This particular spell found use after Fiddlebenders flying vessel was brought down by a band of druids allied with the deadly Legion of the Chimera that menaced the region. The gnome transported a band of mercenary heroes of Targos, and as everyone survived the crash, Oswald tasked them with collecting all the required components. The search brought the heroes into a head-on confrontation with cultists of Auril that had erected their ice palace nearby. When the items were collected and spell cast, Oswald sent heroes to travel to Kuldahar on foot through wind-swept tundra as the mending was taking too long."
