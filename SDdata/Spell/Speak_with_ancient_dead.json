        "mainbody": "Speak with ancient dead was a spell used by clerics of Labelas Enoreth.\nThis spell was a more powerful version of the speak with dead spell. Both spells were identical except for two key differences. Speak with ancient dead allowed the caster to ask more question of the dead, and was able to communicate with corpses that have been deceased for thousands of years. The casters skill level determined both the amount of questions and age of the targeted deceased.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, incense that was burned during casting."
