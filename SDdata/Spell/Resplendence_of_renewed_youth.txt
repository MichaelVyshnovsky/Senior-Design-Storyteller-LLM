Resplendence of renewed youth was a powerful divine alteration and necromancy spell used by priests devoted to Tyr, enabling them to renew the vigor of their youth.
This spell allowed the target to renew the strength of the peak of their physical fitness as a youth by tapping into their spiritual strength. The body of a human target would transform back to how it looked when they were 25 years old. The spell also granted complete immunity to all diseases for its duration of one year.
This spell would only work on individuals who led pious lives, and still only when their current goal or focus could not be completed in their current body. A quest spell needed to first be cast upon the target before casting resplendence of renewed youth, and dropping the quest would automatically forfeit the new body. This spell could only be cast once upon a target. The recipients body would not only return to its previous state when the spell ended, but they would also age an additional 4â€“13 years.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
