        "mainbody": "Revivify was a conjuration or necromancy spell that restored life to a creature that had died very recently.\nThis spelled allowed a recently-deceased being to regain their life, albeit in a weakened and near-death state. In order for revivify to take effect during the Era of Upheaval, the spell had to be cast within a matter of seconds after the moment of death.\nIn all versions of this spell, it required verbal, somatic, and material components. The somatic component was to touch the creature, while the material component was diamonds. For the conjuration spell, the diamonds had to equal 1,000 gp. For the necromancy spell, the diamonds only needed to equal 300 gp.\nIn the late 15 century DR, as an effect of the death curse brought upon Toril by the lich Acererak via the Soulmonger, any spell that restored a creatures spirit to its body, including revivify, automatically failed, as all deceased creatures souls remained imprisoned within the artifact."
