        "mainbody": "peed was a type of giant rune.\nWhen a creature wore footwear inscribed with this rune, they were capable of moving at far greater speeds. If this rune was extensively studied a second time, then this effect would be even greater.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune healing. The process of shaping this rune generally took around ten to forty minutes and it needed to be inscribed upon a set of any kind footwear. Even horseshoes were known to work for this purpose."
