        "mainbody": "'''''Dispel ward''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] from the [[wards sphere]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Set]] called [[Nighthunter]]s. It resembled a limited form of the ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell.",
        "Effects": "This spell was capable of cancelling magical wards, such as any spell from the wards sphere, ''[[wizard lock]]'', ''[[symbol]]'', ''[[glyph of warding]]'', and similar spells. It was a weaker version of the ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell and depended on the priest's skill for success. This spell had no effect against \"wall\" spells such as ''[[wall of fire]]'' or \"sphere\" spells such as ''[[prismatic sphere]]''.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast."
