'''''Animate rope''''', originally known as '''''Vilate's restriction''''' and later '''''bind''''',

==Casters==
In the time of [[Netheril]], ''Vilate's restriction'' could be cast by [[arcanist]]s of the Variation specialization.

''Bind'' could be learned and cast by arcane [[magic-user]]s,

''Animate rope'' could be learned and cast by wizards with access to the [[transmutation]] school, and by [[sorcerer]]s and [[bard]]s, as well as wu jen. In [[Zakhara]], [[elemental mage]]s and [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]] could learn it as part of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].

''Animate rope'' could be also be used by [[cleric]]s with access to the [[Craft domain]]—that is, those who worshiped [[Gond]] of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]]; [[Geb]] or [[Thoth]] of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]]; [[Callarduran Smoothhands]], [[Flandal Steelskin]], or [[Garl Glittergold]] of the [[gnome pantheon]]; or [[Dugmaren Brightmantle]], [[Dumathoin]], [[Laduguer]], or [[Moradin]] of the [[dwarven pantheon]].

==Effects==
This spell was effective on unattended non-living rope and rope-like objects such as twine, string, yarn, [[cable]], or cord.

''Bind'' or ''animate rope'' could be cast at a rope up to {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} or later {{SI|110|ft|long=yes}} away, but if the intention was to interact with a creature or an object, then the rope had to be in close proximity ({{SI|1|ft}}) with its intended target&mdash;the rope could not slither or fly any greater distance. For unwilling targets, this often required someone hurling the rope at them or maneuvering them close to a length of rope.

The commands available with this spell were: ''Coil'', ''Coil & Knot'', ''Loop'', ''Loop & Knot'', and ''Tie & Knot''. ''Coil'' caused the rope to form a neatly organized stack; ''Coil & Knot'' bound the stack for convenient carrying. ''Loop'' wrapped a length of rope around an object, like a tree or the feet of an adversary; ''Loop & Knot'' tied the rope to the tree or formed a lasso. ''Tie & Knot'' wrapped the object securely, like a present or a prisoner. The caster could also order the reverse of any of these commands (''Uncoil'', ''etc.'').

The rope did no direct damage to a creature, so it could not be used to choke or strangle, but it could be used to trip or entangle, with the expected results. The intended victim got one chance to resist the magic of this spell or suffered the consequences. ''Bind'' did not enhance the rope in any way; it remained a non-magical object that could be cut or manipulated like any other rope. The knots themselves were also not magical.

A caster using an animated rope could use it to tie knots and perform other uses of rope a little more easily.

==Components==
Both verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. The material component was the target rope, which was not consumed in the casting.

==History==
This spell was invented by a [[Netherese]] [[variator]] named [[Vilate]] in [[-2195 DR|1664 NY (−2195 DR)]] and was known as ''Vilate's restriction''.

Eventually, it became known as simply ''bind''

The spell was known as ''animate rope'' after 1372 DR.

==Noted Users==
[[File:Bind casting.jpg|thumb|right|Kilili casting ''bind'' on Onyx.]]''Bind'' was a favorite of the [[drow]] magic-user [[Kilili]] in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]]. She used it to trap and toy with the elven women that [[Imgig Zu]] and his [[chasme]] minions kidnapped for her to test.{{Cite comic/The Gathering|7}} She later used it to tie up and gag [[Onyx the Invincible]], largely to stop him complaining.{{Cite comic/Day of the Darkening|10-12}} Uniquely, her version required no rope at all, and instead conjured blue or green strands out of the air, and they dissipated at the end of the spell's duration.

==Notable Uses==
During the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]] in [[Waterdeep]], the [[Shar|false avatar]] of [[Selûne]] stole a coil of rope from a member of the [[Dark Army of the Night]] who'd tried to kidnap her and used ''bind'' to tie the three up.{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|14}}

==Noted Spellbooks and Items==
The ''[[Scrolls of Ha Rahni]]'', the [[spellbook]] of [[Ha Rahni]] of [[Shou Lung]], included a copy of ''bind''.

The ''[[Ky Trencha Ukang]]'', a magical staff of eldritch power created in [[Koryo]], could be used to cast ''bind'' at will.
