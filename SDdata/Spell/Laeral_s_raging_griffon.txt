'''''Laeral's raging griffon''''' was an [[evocation]] [[wizard]] [[spell]] developed by [[Laeral Silverhand]].

==Effects==
This spell created a magical translucent shape in the form of a [[griffon]]. The construct was completely controlled by the caster. The caster could treat the construct as a mount and even see through its eyes. The construct was not as agile during flight if mounted.

If damaged to the point of "death" the construct would simply disappear.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s either a griffon feather or tuft of hair from a griffon tail to cast.
