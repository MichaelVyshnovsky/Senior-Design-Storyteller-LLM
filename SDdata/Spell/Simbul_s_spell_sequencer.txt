The Simbuls spell sequencer was a wizard spell from the schools of alteration, conjuration and evocation. This spell was created by the Simbul and known only to her.
The caster selected up to three other medium-powered spells when memorizing this spell. The selected spells could be spells used by others, including divine spells used by clerics. The accessory spells could even be duplicates of each other if desired, but they needed to be cast directly after the spell sequencer was memorized. The normal spell components were required to cast the accessory spells, but a trigger word was added during the casting of each that would later release the spell when spoken.
All of the accessory spells would instantly be cast, in the same order when they were cast with the spell sequencer, when the trigger word was uttered. Accessory spells that caused harm to others, such as fireball, would always inflict the maximum amount of harm when cast from a spell sequencer.
This spell only required verbal components to cast.
