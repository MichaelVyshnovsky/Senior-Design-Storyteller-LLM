==Effects==
The caster would pick an effect that would grant improvements to the target in a predetermined way:
* [[Bear's endurance|Bear's Endurance]]: The target was granted improved constitution and health.
* [[Bull's strength|Bull's Strength]]: The target gained an improvement to its strength and also was able to carry twice as much as before.
* [[Cat's grace|Cat's Grace]]: The target gained an improvement to its dexterity and could fall from a height of 20 feet without getting hurt.
* [[Eagle's splendor|Eagle's Splendor]]: The target would gain an increased advantage from its charisma.
* [[Fox's cunning|Fox's Cunning]]: The target gained advantages to attempts that used its intelligence.
* [[Owl's wisdom|Owl's Wisdom]]: The target would gain benefits to using wisdom.

For every spell level higher then the normal spell level used, another target could gain a benefit of this spell.

[[Verbal component|Verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components were needed, as well as a feather or fur from a beast as a [[material component]].
