'''Catapult''' was an [[arcane]] [[alteration]] spell in general use throughout the Realms.

==Effects==
This spell caused a loose item roughly the weight of a double-fist sized stone to move in the direction indicated by the spell caster. The item moved in a straight line<ref group="note">This spell's name is somewhat of a misnomer because a catapult is a ballistic weapon which launches items in a parabolic trajectory. up to the range and/or for the duration of the spell and then dropped in place, unless it came in contact with something solid first. Depending on the nature of the missile and the target, and the speed at which it was hurled, damage could result.

Objects hurled by this spell were not capable of damaging the hulls of [[spelljammer]]s.

==Components==
No [[material component]]s were required for this spell; only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]], including pointing in the desired direction. The post-[[Second Sundering]] version of the spell required only somatic components.
