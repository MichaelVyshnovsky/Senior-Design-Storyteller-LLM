Call stone guardian was a divine magic spell granted to priests of Segojan Earthcaller, Earthfriend. It created a stone guardian out of solid rock that did the bidding of the caster until the spell expired.
This spell required a special pure quartz rod, crafted over the course of ten days and having a value of not less than 1,000 gold pieces. The rod was used to control the stone guardian, allowing the caster to give the creature simple commands. The priest had to touch a block of solid stone at least  in weight, and the spell lasted for at least 90 minutes (longer for more experienced casters). The crystal rod shattered into worthless shards when the spell expired. The spell also ended if the rod was prematurely broken.
This spell required verbal and somatic components, as well as a fine rock crystal rod crafted as described above. The priests holy symbol was also required in the casting.
