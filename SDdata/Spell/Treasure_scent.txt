Treasure scent was a spell that allowed the caster to smell valuables.
On casting treasure scent, the caster was surrounded by a metallic glow of various colors that went into the casters nose. The caster then became able to smell valuables. What counted as valuables were gems, copper, silver, gold, and platinum. but wind direction and intensity could help or hinder detection. If the caster was downwind of the treasure, the range increased to 60 ft (18 m) upwind reduced it to 15 ft (4.6 m) an open chest full of coins could be smelled at double these ranges a dragon hoard at triple range. Those with skill at tracking could use this new sense to track a creature carrying valuables, but success became more difficult with every passing hour.
The spell only required only somatic and verbal components.
