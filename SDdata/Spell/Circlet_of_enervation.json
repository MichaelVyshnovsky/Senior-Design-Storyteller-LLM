        "mainbody": "'''''Circlet of enervation''''' was a spell that created a small, 6\"-in-diameter ring of [[negative energy]] in the hand of the caster. The spellcaster could then launch the ring at an opponent nearby, whereupon another would appear in their hand, and would continuously replenish until the duration of the spell expired. These rings would harm the living as per the [[enervation|spell]] they were named after as well as heal and bolster the [[undead]].\n\nThe material component of this spell was a bracelet made of [[jet]], worth at least 100gp.",
