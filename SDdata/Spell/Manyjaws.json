        "mainbody": "Manyjaws was an offensive wizard spell.\nThis spell created a pair of snapping jaws. Wizards with more skill were able to create more pairs of the jaws. The jaws were actually teeth that floated in the air, lacking all of the regular associated anatomy. The caster could will the teeth to attack anything before them.\nWhen attacking, these teeth could ignore non-magical armor but magic armor offered some protection against them.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a pair of teeth of any size to cast."
