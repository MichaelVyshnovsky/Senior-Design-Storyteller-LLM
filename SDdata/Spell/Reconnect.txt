}}'''''Reconnect''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was a closely guarded secret weapon used by members of the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]].

==Effects==
Wizards used this spell to re-attune themselves to their magical powers after [[spellslaying]]. The reconnection lasted for the spell's duration. If the wizard performed a spellslaying that kept them from casting spells longer than the reconnection spell's duration, then the wizard would not be able to cast spells after the reconnection spell ended.

==Components==
This spell did not require physical components to cast.
