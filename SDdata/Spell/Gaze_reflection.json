        "Effects": "When cast, the air in front of the cast began to glitter, becoming reflective like a [[mirror]]. This disc of shimmering air moved with the caster. It protected the caster from effects and spells that relied on eye contact. The effects are instead reflected back to the target.",

        "History": "The spell was invented in [[-1772 DR|âˆ’1772 DR]] by the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Niquie]]. It was originally called '''''Niquie's reflection'''''."
