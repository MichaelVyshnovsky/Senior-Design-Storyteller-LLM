'''''Windsong''''' was a rare [[alteration]] spell that allowed the caster to change the properties of a [[gateway]] to send the caster to [[Windsong Tower]].

==Effects==
This spell ignored a gateway's normal distance limitations. [[Windsong Towerkin]] used this spell to travel to the [[Windsong Tower]] from as far away as [[Calimshan]] and the [[Tears of Sel√ªne]].

The spell was used with a [[Towerkin ring]]. The rings allowed the wearer to ''[[teleport without error]]'' to the largest building in the Windsong Tower complex, within a 5 mile (8 kilometer) radius from the center of [[Myth Drannor]]. The spell enhanced the ring's abilities, which allowed for teleportation from any existing gateway to the Tower.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s.
