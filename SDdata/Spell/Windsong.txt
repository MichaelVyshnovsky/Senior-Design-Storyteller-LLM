Windsong was a rare alteration spell that allowed the caster to change the properties of a gateway to send the caster to Windsong Tower.
This spell ignored a gateways normal distance limitations. Windsong Towerkin used this spell to travel to the Windsong Tower from as far away as Calimshan and the Tears of Sel√ªne.
The spell was used with a Towerkin ring. The rings allowed the wearer to teleport without error to the largest building in the Windsong Tower complex, within a 5 mile (8 kilometer) radius from the center of Myth Drannor. The spell enhanced the rings abilities, which allowed for teleportation from any existing gateway to the Tower.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components.
