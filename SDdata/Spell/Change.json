        "mainbody": "Change was a legerdemain cantrip that neophyte wizards could learn. It temporarily altered one small animal into another or one small item made from vegetable matter into another.\nThis cantrip only worked on very small objects and animals that roughly fit in the palm of the casters hand.That is, the altered target could be no less than 50% and no more than 150% of its original size. Depending on the degree of alteration, the effects of change typically lasted ten minutes, whereas a drastic change might only last one minute and a minor change might last a day or two. Magical targets, or targets with more than animal intelligence had a chance to resist this spell.\nExamples of typical transformations included changing a mouse to a mole, a bird to a bat, a rose to a firethorn, or a piece of parchment to a square of cloth. Examples of radical transformations included changing a dead mouse to a live one, a bird to a flying squirrel, a rose to piece of parchment, or a square of cloth to a tomato. Examples of minor transformations included changing a white mouse to blue, or a maple leaf to an oak leaf.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster spoke a magic word while passing a hand over the target object or creature."
