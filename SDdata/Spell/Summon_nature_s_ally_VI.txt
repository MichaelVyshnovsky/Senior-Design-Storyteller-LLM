Summon natures ally VI was one of the series of summon natures ally spells available to druidic spellcasters.
This spell functioned just like all summon natures ally spells, which in turn resembled the summon monster spells. It could summon a single dire bear, huge elemental of any type, elephant, girallon, megaraptor, giant octopus, pixie (which favored casting Ottos irresistible dance), salamander, baleen whale, or xorn. It could also be used to summon a larger number of monsters from a lower level of a spell in the series.
The spell required a divine focus and both verbal and somatic components.
