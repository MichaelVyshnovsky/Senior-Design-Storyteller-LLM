        "mainbody": "Flame blade was an evocation spell that created a sword-like beam of fire that extended from the casters hand and performed similar to a scimitar.\nthumb|A halfling with the flame blade.\nThe blade inflicted fire damage, could ignite items, and gave off light. Strangely enough, this flaming blade was not a magical weapon but unsurprisingly, it wouldnt work underwater.\nAll versions required verbal and somatic components, but the oldest version and the post-Second Sundering version required the caster to have a leaf of sumac."
