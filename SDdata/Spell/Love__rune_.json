        "mainbody": "ove was a type of giant rune that gave casters another way to create philters of love.\nWhenever any liquid was first poured into an inscribed drinking vessel the love rune would cause it transmute into a philter of love. If the rune was improperly inscribed than the liquid would instead cause someone to hate the first creature they saw after consumption of the philter.\nRegardless of what the liquid had transmuted into it, it would revert to its previous state within an hour.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune healing. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to eight hours and it needed to be inscribed upon a drinking vessel, such as a cup or goblet."
