        "mainbody": "Burning sands was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell caused regular sand to become combustible. The sand appeared exactly the same as normal sand, but also had the flammable properties of lantern oil. Once lit the sand would burn for the spells duration or for one hour.\nThis spell was used heavily by nomadic tribes who did not have access to wood or other material for their fires. One handful of burning sand provided the same heat as a cooking fire. Burning sand could not be extinguished by any normal means.\nThis spell required sand to cast."
