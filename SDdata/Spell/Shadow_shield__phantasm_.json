        "mainbody": "'''''Shadow shield''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]], specifically a [[phantasm]], that formed an insubstantial [[shield]].",
        "Effects": "Upon being cast, ''shadow shield'' drew material from the [[Demiplane of Shadow]], which was then shaped by the will of the caster into a shield of any desired appearance. This ''shield'' was insubstantial, and while this meant it did not impede the caster's movement as a normal shield would, it also did not physically defend its wielder to any degree.\n\nIndeed, the ''shield'' proved ineffective against harm from sources lacking any direct agency, such as [[trap]]s, geological hazards, or other spells. Thinking creatures, however, were often fooled and would instinctively pull back slightly from attacks against the ''shield''. However, sufficiently intelligent opponents, perhaps clued in by recognizing their foe as a spellcaster or the odd interaction between their melee weapon and the ''shield'', could overcome the illusion's effects.",
        "History": "[[Aaldric Talzon]] of the [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] detailed ''shadow shield'' in the ''[[Aegis Manual I]]'', first in a prospective series of [[spellbook]]s containing protective spells.{{Cite dragon/271/Arcane Lore: Spells of Defense|68-70}}"
