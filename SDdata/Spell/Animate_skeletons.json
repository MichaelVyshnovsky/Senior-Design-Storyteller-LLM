        "mainbody": "'''''Animate skeletons''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that created a number of [[skeletons]] from nearby available remains.",
        "Effects": "Similar to the spell ''[[animate dead]]'', this spell reanimated the remains of a number of [[humanoid]]s, depending on the power of the caster. The skeletal [[undead]] obeyed simple verbal commands as given by the caster until they were [[turn undead|turned]] by a [[priest]], or otherwise destroyed. The [[magic]]al effect of ''animate skeletons'' could not be ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]''.",
        "Casting": "This spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]] and [[material component]]s in order to be cast. The material component consisted of a mixture comprising a drop of blood and a pinch of bone powder (or bone shard) that was combined with a specific salve that cost at least 10 [[gp]]. Once the mixture was applied to remains,"
