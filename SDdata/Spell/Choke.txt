'''''Choke''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]] from the schools of [[necromancy]] and [[conjuration]] that allowed a [[wizard]] to asphyxiate a target.

==Powers==
This spell created a pair of ghostly hands that strangled a single target provided they were roughly [[humanoid]] in shape and smaller than an [[ogre]]. The hands would continue to choke the victim for the spell's duration, which was based upon the caster's skill. The hands could not be physically removed from the target's neck, but the spell could be ''[[Dispel magic|dispelled]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a handkerchief or small piece of cloth to cast. The cloth was tied into a know during the casting.

==History==
This spell was found within the ''[[Book of Shadows]]'', a [[tome]] based upon the oration of the [[necromancer]] [[Nebt Bhakau]] of [[Zakhara]].
