Spill was a reversed cantrip that apprentice wizards could learn. It caused a small container to tip over, possibly disgorging its contents.
The target of this spell had to be within  of the caster and could only affect containers of up to about  in capacity. For example, a bottle of wine or a small coffer of gems could be upended and, if not securely sealed or closed, the contents splashed or scattered in the usual fashion. Magic items and large items were not affected by this cantrip.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster made a sudden tipping motion with a hand and spoke the magical incantation uh-oh.
