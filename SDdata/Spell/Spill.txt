'''''Spill''''' was a reversed [[cantrip]] that apprentice [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It caused a small container to tip over, possibly disgorging its contents.

==Effects==
The target of this spell had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster and could only affect containers of up to about {{SI|1|gal|L|long=yes}} in capacity. For example, a bottle of [[wine]] or a small coffer of [[gem]]s could be upended and, if not securely sealed or closed, the contents splashed or scattered in the usual fashion. [[Magic item]]s and large items were not affected by this cantrip.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster made a sudden tipping motion with a hand and spoke the magical incantation ''uh-oh''.
