Power word, heal was a powerful spell used by bards.
When cast, this spell had the power to heal nearly all wounds. If the targeted individual was charmed, paralyzed, stunned or suffering from fear, this spell returned then to their normal mental state. The caster was required to physically touch the target. This spell had no effect on constructs or undead creatures.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a skin shed from a lizard.
