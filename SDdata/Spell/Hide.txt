'''''Hide''''' was a legerdemain [[cantrip]] that initiate [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It temporarily rendered one object or creature invisible to an audience.

==Effects==
This cantrip was only effective for viewers in front of the caster and ineffective for anyone standing behind or beside the caster. The maximum duration of this minor [[illusion]] was ten minutes for a target of size {{SI|2|cu yd|long=yes}} or less, and proportionally less as the volume of the target increased. For example, a {{SI|4|cu yd}} object could be hidden for up to nine minutes, {{SI|20|cu yd}} for one minute, {{SI|30|cu yd}} for 30 seconds, and so on, with objects above {{SI|38|cu yd}} only flickering out briefly before reappearing. This cantrip did not mask scents, mute sounds, or hide footprints. The spell could be deactivated by speaking the magic word a second time.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster spoke a magic word (such as ''abracadabra'') while waving a hand over the front of the target object or creature.
