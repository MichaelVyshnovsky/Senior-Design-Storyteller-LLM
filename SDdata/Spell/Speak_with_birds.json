        "mainbody": "Speak with birds was a divine alteration spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Thoth called Scriveners.\nWith this spell a Scrivener could understand and communicate with any normal or giant bird possessing animal intelligence. The cooperation of the bird was not guaranteed, but the priest was able to ask questions and receive answers. The quality of answers provided by the bird depended on their general nature and intelligence.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
