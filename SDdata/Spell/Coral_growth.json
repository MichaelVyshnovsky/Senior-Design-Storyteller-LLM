        "mainbody": "'''''Coral growth''''' was a spell that caused a small living piece of [[coral]], the material component, to grow and shape at a rapid pace into the form the spellcaster wished. The maximum size of the growth was limited, but not so in relation to the size of the component piece.\n\nThis spell was popular for the creation of coral buildings in [[Halruaa]] as well as the establishment of underwater dwellings and cities by the aquatic races of [[Faer√ªn]].",
