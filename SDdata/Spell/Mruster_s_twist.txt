==History==
By {{yearlink|241}}, ''[[Jhalavan's fond return]]'' had been modified to create ''Mruster's Twist''. [[Elminster Aumar]], a new [[human]] [[armathor]] of [[Myth Drannor|Cormanthor]], used the spell in his duel against [[Delmuth Echorn]]. He used it to convert a spell akin to ''[[acid rain]]'' into a ''[[dispel magic]]'' to strike at his opponent's ''[[mantle (cormathan)|mantle]]''.
