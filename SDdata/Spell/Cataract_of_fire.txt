'''''Cataract of fire''''' was a [[spell]] of [[epic magic]].

==Effects==
''Cataract of fire'' was at its core a giant ''[[flame strike]]'' with a number of differences. First, there was the aforementioned size. The flame pillar was 300 feet (91 meters) in radius and 2000 feet (610 meters) tall, meaning it could be used to attack air-borne creatures. Second, there was the source the spell was powered from. while ''cataract of fire'' was composed half by fire and half by arcane power. Third, there was the strength. ''Cataract of fire'' harmed everyone and everything within the aforementioned area, but also to a lesser, but still highly destructive, degree everyone and everything within a quarter mile (400 meters) of the conjured pillar. Fourth, there was the range. ''Flame strike'' could be cast so that the flame pillar was located away from the caster, but ''cataract of fire'' caused a flame pillar that fell directly on the caster. The spell conferred immunity against the arcane energy, but did nothing of the sort regarding the fire, meaning the caster was hurt by it.

Magical effects within the affected area were dissolved as though under a ''[[disintegrate]]'' spell. Magical matter, force effects, and energy fields were simply destroyed by ''cataract of fire''.

==Components==
''Cataract of fire'' required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s. The material component was a [[bronze]] gong. This gong was consumed when the spell was cast, not because it was consumed the conventional way on casting, but because it could not withstand the spell. The spell needed an entire minute to cast and the aforementioned gong was struck on completion.

==History==
By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''cataract of fire'' was counted among the most feared spells ever created on [[Faer√ªn]].
