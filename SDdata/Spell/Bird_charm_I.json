        "Effects": "This spell allowed a caster to summon up to three small birds within 100 yards (91 meters) of the caster. More birds could be summoned as the caster's skill level increased. The most common birds summoned were hummingbirds and parrots. The summoned birds were able to comprehend rudimentary commands and could relay a very short message of up to three words.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a small whistle made of coral. The caster had to carve this whistle themselves. The spell took several days to cast."
