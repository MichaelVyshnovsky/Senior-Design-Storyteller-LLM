        "mainbody": "Tyranny was a divine enchantment spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Gilgeam called Martinets.\nThis spell enabled to caster to command obedience from anyone within a  radius. Any creature unable to resist the spells magic would obey the caster as if he were their king provided the caster did not command them to perform actions against their nature. A Martinet using this spell against Gilgeams wishes would be punished severely.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the Martinets holy symbol and a golden circlet worth at least 250 gp to cast. The circlet was placed upon the Martinets head during the casting and vanished upon the spells completion."
