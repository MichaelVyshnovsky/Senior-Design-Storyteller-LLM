        "Effects": "This spell enabled to caster to command obedience from anyone within a {{SI|120|ft}} radius. Any creature unable to resist the spell's magic would obey the caster as if he were their king provided the caster did not command them to perform actions against their nature. A Martinet using this spell against Gilgeam's wishes would be punished severely.",
