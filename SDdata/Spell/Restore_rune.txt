In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a pinch of powdered [[gemstone]], a piece of chalk, and three twigs from any plant bound together to form a triangle to cast.

==History==
''Restore rune'' was granted to [[priest]]s of [[Deneir]], the Lord of All Glyphs.
