        "mainbody": "'''''Gunther's kaleidoscopic strike''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s. This spell was developed by [[Gunther]].",
        "Effects": "This spell shot a beam of multi-colored light from the caster's fingertips toward a target. The spell targeted the magical energy stored within the mind of a wizard or [[priest]], scrambling the energy and erasing it from their mind, causing them to lose a random number of spells they had memorized.\n\nThis spell had absolutely no effect on non-spellcasters or creatures that only used innate magical abilities.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast."
