Teleport without error, or greater teleport, was a conjuration spell that allowed the caster to instantly transit from one location to another.
This spell allowed a caster to teleport directly to the visualized location with perfect accuracy. The caster was not required to have visited the target destination beforehand, but they did require an accurate description of the location before casting the spell. If the caster was unsuccessful in visualizing the target destination, they vanished briefly and then re-appeared. A caster was unable to use this spell to teleport between planes or crystal spheres.
This spell required only a verbal component to cast.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Oberon in , 24 years before he invented the less powerful variant teleport, and was originally called Oberons flawless teleport.
