'''''Teleport without error''''', or '''''greater teleport''''', was a [[conjuration]] spell that allowed the caster to instantly transit from one location to another.

==Effects==
This spell allowed a caster to ''[[teleport]]'' directly to the visualized location with perfect accuracy. The caster was not required to have visited the target destination beforehand, but they did require an accurate description of the location before casting the spell. If the caster was unsuccessful in visualizing the target destination, they vanished briefly and then re-appeared. A caster was unable to use this spell to ''teleport'' between [[planes]] or [[crystal sphere]]s.

==Components==
This spell required only a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component to cast.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Oberon (Netherese arcanist)|Oberon]] in {{Yearlink|-983}}, 24 years before he invented the less powerful variant ''[[teleport]]'', and was originally called '''''Oberon's flawless teleport'''''.
