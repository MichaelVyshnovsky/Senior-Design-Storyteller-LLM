The surviving tribespeople were simple villagers—hunters, farmers, and craftspeople including weavers, carpenters, masons, blacksmiths, and musicians. The Lost Vale tribe also lost all their young during the time of their enslavement. After Moander's demise, saurials resumed procreation and peaceful lives. That experience left the first generation of saurials with somber attitudes and heavy memories, but they looked with hope at the young.\n\nDue to the trauma, the older generations remained mostly isolated but never xenophobic. On the other hand, the younger generations showed curiosity about the larger world, and some chose to venture outside the Vale, exploring and adventuring. Due to their community-centric culture, those young saurial adventurers often found a group to stick with, creating strong bonds with them.{{Cite web enhancement/Saurials: More Lizardkin|2}}\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:Saurial homes.png|left|thumb|300x300px|''A typical saurial village.'']]\nIn their daily lives, saurials rarely wore anything but [[loincloth]]s and simple [[cloak]]s when they resided in places with a tropical climate.

The homes were built one room at a time as the need for space arose.[[File:Hill Cleaver - Clyde Caldwell.jpg|thumb|''Saurial broadsword.'']] \n\nSaurials tended to mate for life, producing one or two eggs a year. Both males and females cared for the egg, by keeping it safe and warm and, later, raising, feeding, and teaching the hatchling. Saurials reached adulthood at the age of five, but it took them much longer to achieve emotional and intelligent maturity, akin to human youth. They had a long lifespan, with some individuals living for much longer than 200 years (sages did not know the exact life expectancy of a saurial, but theorized they could live as long as a [[dwarf]],{{cite dragon/292/Lords of the Lost Vale|38}} but in [[1357 DR]], the saurial leader [[Grypht]] was already far past 200 years old without the use of magic promoting longevity).\n\nThe bigger subraces needed to consume a lot of vegetation to survive, which limited the numbers of saurials a piece of land could support.\n\nLacerials of the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur, lived in the village of [[Lilac (village)|Lilac]], situated on a bank of the [[River of Laughing Idols]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/The Courage of a Coward}} Usually peaceful people, Malatran saurials were often avoided by their neighbors due to misguided conflicts between the communities, before lacerials moved to Malatra.

They carved lines and etches on sticks. This form of communication was mostly used by spell-casters and for record-keeping.\n\n===Saurial Names===\nSaurials used their language along with a scent for their names. They used objects and concepts of value or importance to name their hatchlings, instead of using abstract names that bore no meaning. The names used for them in [[Common]] were either loose translations or nicknames. Saurials were comfortable using nicknames if they couldn't find a suitable translation when among other creatures and cultures. When around kin, they used saurial language names.{{cite dragon/292/Lords of the Lost Vale|39}}",
        "Description": "Saurials were intelligent bipedal [[humanoid]]s who descended from [[dinosaur]]-like creatures of an unknown [[crystal sphere]]. On Toril, only four types of saurials existed: bladebacks, finheads, flyers, and hornheads—all names given to them by the natives of the [[Realms]]. Their names in the [[saurial language]] were combinations of noises, chirps, and scents, unreplicable by mammalian humanoids.\n\nAll the saurial types possessed fine brightly colored scales of various hues from tan brown to green and aquamarine. The scales on their backs formed patterns unique to each subrace. Each of the saurial types occasionally produced individuals born with [[albinism]]. All had sharp claws and tails, but otherwise their bodies were considerably different.\n* '''Finheads''':{{Cite web/Saurials: More Lizardkin|6}} The most [[human]]-shaped of the saurials, they were generally shorter than an average human, standing around {{SI|5'|'\"|long=yes}} with a long tail. Finheads were named for a prominent fin on the tops of their heads. They had muscular and agile bodies and often became [[fighter]]s and [[paladin]]s.\n* '''Bladebacks''':{{Cite web/Saurials: More Lizardkin|5}} Taller and bulkier than finhead saurials, they grew up to {{SI|7'|'\"|long=yes}} and had rows of sharp bone-hard scale protrusions running from the tops of their heads, down their backs, and all the way to the tips of their tails.\n* '''Flyers''':{{Cite web/Saurials: More Lizardkin|7}} The smallest of the saurials at {{SI|3'8|'\"|long=yes}}. They had thin and delicate bodies, short legs, stubby tails, and hands with large stretches of skin that formed wings. Although clumsy and slow on land, they moved with speed and grace in the air. Rarely, flyers had bright red spots around their necks.\n* '''Hornheads''':{{Cite web/Saurials: More Lizardkin|8}} The largest of the saurials, hornheads grew up to {{SI|10'|'\"|long=yes}} tall. They had powerful thick tails that were longer than their bodies, sturdy bulky frames, long sharp horns on their heads and crests of tough bony plates that protected their necks. Despite their intimidating physique, these saurials were the most likely to take on a spellcaster's mantle.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Magic": "The saurial homeworld had both [[arcane magic|arcane]] and [[divine magic|divine]] [[magic]]. Their natural attributes aided them in pursuit of the Art and the Power.{{Cite web/Saurials: More Lizardkin|3}}\n\nSaurial paladins possessed an ability called ''shen sight'', somewhat similar to Toril's ''divine sense''. It granted saurial paladins a second sight that allowed them to see individuals' thoughts, feelings, desires, goals, even into the spirit and the soul. The soul appeared to the paladin in complex swirls of forms and colors: gray was the color of [[Neutral|neutrality]], purples and reds indicated [[evil]], a black void represented evil [[undead]] creatures, blue the powers of [[good]], and yellow meant greed. The clarity of the colors indicated the purity of the soul."
        },
        "Personality": "Each of the saurial subraces treated each other with equality and respect, using each group's natural talents to maximize the community's accomplishments. Because none of the different subraces of saurials could interbreed, however, most households were homogeneous.\n\nThey befriended others with ease and only rarely made enemies, though they were quick to respond if there was an obvious danger. Mates and siblings shared much stronger bonds than other humanoids and protected one another from harm whenever possible.\n[[File:Finhead dragon mag.jpeg|thumb|290x290px|''A finhead saurial crafter.'']]\n* Finheads tended to be smart, curious, and emotional. They often had a black-and-white view of morality and the world. Finheads were excitable when facing new tasks and experiences, often charging headfirst into dangerous situations. This personality made adventuring saurials found outside of the Lost Vale very likely to be a finhead.\n* Hornheads were prone to slow, careful, rational thinking and had impeccable planning and analytical skills. They spoke slowly, carefully choosing every word. Hornheads had a knack for arts, sciences, and crafts that involved physical strength. Like any other race in the Realms, hornheads could be of any vocation, but generally, they swayed towards being [[cleric]]s, [[wizard]]s, and [[sorcerer]]s.\n* Bladebacks were highly social beings who loved diverse company and engaging conversation. They tended to be trusting and direct while being empathetic and understanding. Usually, it was hard to anger bladebacks, but if they were pushed to anger or wronged somehow, they were slow to forgive. Bladebacks often took on positions of leadership, advisory roles, and clergy.\n* Flyers were small, quick, curious, nervous, and both irritable and irritating. They often preferred flight to fight and loved conversation and gossip. Most commonly, flyers took on the roles of messengers, [[scout]]s, fighters, and [[rogue]]s. However, many flyers defied stereotypes throughout saurial history, which was one of the things flyers loved to mention in conversation.",
        "Combat": "Saurials, when forced into combat, used a wide variety of skills and [[weapon]]s according to their profession. The most often-used types of [[blade]]s, crafted by and for saurials, had short grips and [[diamond]]-shaped barbed tips. Most other races found them difficult and uncomfortable to handle, while saurials found other humanoids' weapons similarly difficult.\n\nEven unarmed, saurials were far from defenseless. Most were trained in ancient martial arts that involved the use of their claws, tails, bites, and/or horns.\n\nSaurials had a thick protective natural hide but were known to outfit themselves with sturdier armor when pressed, even though wearing it was somewhat alien to them.",
        "Society": {
            "Culture": "[[File:Saurial homes.png|left|thumb|300x300px|''A typical saurial village.'']]\nIn their daily lives, saurials rarely wore anything but [[loincloth]]s and simple [[cloak]]s when they resided in places with a tropical climate.

        "History": "[[File:Lost Vale map.gif|thumb|480x480px|''The home of the saurials on Toril, the Lost Vale.'']]\nThe first saurial to be brought to Toril was the paladin Dragonbait. In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, [[Phalse]] captured him as part of the complex arcane process to create Alias. The god of rot, Moander, was a part of the alliance of dark powers that joined together to create their perfect [[construct]] weapon.\n\nThis led to the saurial community Dragonbait hailed from being brought to Toril by Moander in 1358 DR. The evil deity settled his new slaves in a place called the Lost Vale, a hidden locale near the [[Dalelands]].{{Cite web/Saurials: More Lizardkin|2}} He corrupted the saurials with the ''[[seed of Moander]]'', forcing them to destroy all living things in the area, including their own eggs, to rebuild Moander's power in the Realms. The deity used Dragonbait's old lover [[Coral (saurial)|Coral]] as his main pawn, the ''Mouth of Moander''. However, his plan failed as Finder Wyvernspur, Dragonbait, and Alias found a way to destroy Moander, freeing the saurials from enslavement. Coral, unfortunately, was irreversibly rotted from the inside by the god's corrupting vines and was released from her torturous existence by Dragonbait. The surviving saurials, with [[Elminster]]'s aid, decided to build a life for themselves on Toril, restoring what Moander had forced them to destroy. The Lost Vale was turned into a permanent settlement as a result.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, a group of six finhead saurials resided in the jungles of [[Chult]], having been transported there years prior by a helpful wizard. That group was not aggressive but proficient in jungle survival. They spoke in a mix of saurial, [[Batiri]], and [[monkey spider]] languages.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, saurials were becoming less reclusive, on occasion leaving the Vale to trade and travel. They remained mostly unwitnessed by the people of neighboring regions. Still, the stories of the curious \"dragonfolk\" were spreading further and further out from the Dalelands. By 1373 DR, the number of members of the Lost Vale tribe increased dramatically from the original 110 to 485 individuals.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, saurials had multiple settlements throughout the Lost Vale. But with the return of the empire [[Netheril]] to northern [[Faerûn]] and taking control of Tarkhaldale, many of the \"dragonfolk\" were driven underground.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, saurial hides were considered to be valuable illicit black market goods in Waterdeep, the City of Splendors. Belts and boots made of saurial hides were among such illegal items. However, often enough, saurial hide was counterfeited, and the items were, in reality, made out of Calishite [[river-gator]] hide.{{Cite web/The Unforking Family Tree|35}}",

He was the \"soul brother\" and a traveling companion of Alias, as well as the protector of the Lost Vale.\n*[[Grypht]]: A hornhead wizard who led the community of the Lost Vale from 1358 to 1373 DR, and possibly much later. He was the tribe's protector who played the key role in defeating Moander. He had three apprentices.\n*[[Rex]]: A bladeback saurial who claimed to be the Lost Vale tribe's leader before their arrival on Toril.\n*[[Sweetleaf]]: A bladeback cleric who worshiped the saurial world's goddess of harvest and agriculture.

Sweetleaf had five acolytes.\n*[[Trueblood]]: A hornhead and leader of the lacerials of Malatra after their flight from the Valley of Spirits; he was supported by [[Quickwing]], a flyer rogue, [[Starr]], a bladeback shaman, and [[Strongarm]], a bladeback fighter."
