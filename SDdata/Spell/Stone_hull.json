        "mainbody": "Stone hull was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell strengthened a ships hull with a magical aura, helping it withstand attacks from sea monsters, hidden reefs, or bombardment. This spell countered the effects of warp wood and turn wood. It did not offer additional protection from fire.\nAny ship under the influence of this spell had its movement speed cut in half.\nThis spell required a bit of pumice to cast."
