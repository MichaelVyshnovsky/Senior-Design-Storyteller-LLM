        "mainbody": "'''''Mindshatter''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] [[spell]] from the [[thought sphere]] that created a form of insanity within the target.",
        "Effects": "The casting [[priest]] could inflict one of five different forms of insanity upon the target as detailed below:\n\n* ''Schizophrenia'', characterized by a loss of personality.\n* ''Dementia'', characterized by a lack of interest in doing anything.\n* ''[[Delusional insanity]]'', characterized by the conviction that the target was someone of great importance.\n* ''Paranoia'', characterized by a strong belief that the target was being spied upon.\n* ''Hallucinatory insanity'', characterized by sensing things that did not exist.\n\nThe duration of the spell was based upon the target's intelligence and mental fortitude, but could last anywhere from one day to one month. Insanity caused by ''mindshatter'' could be negated by a ''[[wish]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', or a ''[[heal]]'' spell cast for that specific purpose.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a small bust of a [[human]] head made from fine porcelain to cast. The bust was shattered during the casting.",
        "History": "''Mindshatter'' was found within ''[[Gorothir's Girdle]]'', a holy book from the [[Church of Shar]]."
