'''''Vitriolic sphere''''' was an [[evocation]] spell that created an explosion of [[acid]].

==Effects==
The spell created a shimmering [[emerald]]-green sphere of acid about {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in diameter that then flew directly to a point within a range of {{SI|150|ft|long=yes}} of the caster. Upon arriving at its target, the sphere exploded and covered everyone within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in potent acid, which remained active for several seconds following the explosion.

Older versions of this spell, belonging to the [[conjuration]] school, had a longer range, reaching up to {{SI|150|yd|long=yes}} and producing acid that lasted for up to 5 minutes.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was either a drop of bile from a [[giant slug]] or a small glass vile filled with [[aqua regia]].
