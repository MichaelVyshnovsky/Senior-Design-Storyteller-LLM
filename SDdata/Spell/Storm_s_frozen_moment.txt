Storms frozen moment was a wizard spell created by Storm Silverhand.
This spell was used to cause temporary interruption of any creature moving through the air. It affected both natural and magical movements. If the caster wished to cast this spell on an unwilling recipient, touching them greatly lowered their chance to resist the spells effects.
When the spell took effect, the being was halted mid-air for one minute. The being was held stable, allowing them to perform normal functions such as casting a spell of their own or tying a knot.
If cast upon a being under the influence of the feather fall spell (or similar magic items), Storms frozen moment would negate that spell or item for ten minutes after the spell expired.
Storms frozen moment only required verbal and somatic components to cast.
