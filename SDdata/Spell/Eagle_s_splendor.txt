Eagles splendor was a transmutation spell that made the subject more charismatic.
When successfully cast, the targeted creature exuded charisma, their body language become more poised, their speech was more articulate and their personality became a force to be reckoned with. If this spell was cast on a bard or a sorcerer, their respective spells had a increased effect on creatures.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a handful of feathers or a pinch of dung from an eagle.
