Flashpuff was a common spell used by geisha. The spell was sometimes used by wu jen and was extremely rare outside Kara-Tur.
The spell was cast when the caster tossed a small amount of fine white powder into a fire, creating a small cloud. The color of the cloud was determined by the caster. The caster could also add a blinding flash when the spell was cast, such that whoever was looking at the fire when the spell was cast was temporarily blinded. A geisha was able to manipulate the shape of the cloud into simple forms, and was also able to create artwork on the cloud. 
The spell required somatic and material components.
