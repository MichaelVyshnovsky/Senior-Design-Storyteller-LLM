'''''Flashpuff''''' was a common spell used by [[geisha]]. The spell was sometimes used by [[wu jen]] and was extremely rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
The spell was cast when the caster tossed a small amount of fine white powder into a fire, creating a small cloud. The color of the cloud was determined by the caster. The caster could also add a blinding flash when the spell was cast, such that whoever was looking at the fire when the spell was cast was temporarily blinded. A geisha was able to manipulate the shape of the cloud into simple forms, and was also able to create artwork on the cloud. 

==Components==
The spell required [[somatic component|somatic]] and [[material component]]s.
