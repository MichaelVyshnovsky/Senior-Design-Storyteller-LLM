        "Effects": "Upon casting this spell, which took a full minute, the caster could sense if the area within a cone of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} radius contained any [[portal]]s. If portals were present, the caster could continue to concentrate and analyze each portal to learn its properties.\n\nThe caster would instantly know the size and location of a portal within the area of effect. As successive seconds passed, the caster would learn new properties, depending on his or her power, in the following order:\n# the command word or key required to operate the portal,\n# specific circumstances under which the portal could be used,\n# the directionality of the portal,\n# other special properties, such as being creature-only or random, and finally,\n# a visualization of to where the portal led.\n\nOne could not extend the effects of other divinatory magics through the portals being studied.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components and the use of a lens made of crystal and a small mirror, which were consumed in the casting. Clerics who could access this spell instead used their [[holy symbol]] as a [[spell focus|focus]]."
