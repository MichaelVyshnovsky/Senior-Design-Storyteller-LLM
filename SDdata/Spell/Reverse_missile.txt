'''''Reverse missile''''' was a rare [[abjuration]] spell of the [[southern magic]] tradition.{{Southernmagic}}

==Effects==
The spell protected the caster from all missile weapons, including mundane missiles such as arrows or ballistae, and magical missiles such as ''[[magic missile]]'' or ''[[Acid arrow|Melf's acid arrow]]''. The caster was still vulnerable to non-missile ranged attacks, including ''[[fireball]]'' and ''[[disintegrate]]'', however.

The missile would reverse course and strike the attacker, as long as they were in range of the spell, which was 80 yards (73 meters). A reversed missile always struck their target, and the attacker took double the damage.
 
==Components==
The spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components to cast.
