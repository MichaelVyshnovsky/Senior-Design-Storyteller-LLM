        "mainbody": "Command element was a spell used commonly in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by wizards.\nThere were four versions of this spell, one for each of the elements. The caster needed to memorize each version separately.\nThis spell allowed the caster control over the four elements so long as they were not directly attacking or affecting living creatures with them. The caster could sculpt, part, move, and shape each element. The implications of these actions were only limited by the imagination and creativity of the caster.\nExamples of potential outcomes of using this spell included\n* removing salt from sea water\n* altering the course of a fire\n* raising the level of a river\n* removing dangerous gases from the air\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast."
