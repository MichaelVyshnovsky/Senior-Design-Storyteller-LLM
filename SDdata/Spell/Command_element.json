        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster control over the four elements so long as they were not directly attacking or affecting living creatures with them. The caster could sculpt, part, move, and shape each element. The implications of these actions were only limited by the imagination and creativity of the caster.\n\nExamples of potential outcomes of using this spell included:\n* removing salt from sea water\n* altering the course of a fire\n* raising the level of a river\n* removing dangerous gases from the air",
        "Components": "This spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast."
