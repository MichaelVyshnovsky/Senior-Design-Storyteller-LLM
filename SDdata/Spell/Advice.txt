'''''Advice''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell would allow the caster to give advice to a creature of medium to low intelligence. This advice was profound and thoughtful. The caster and the target creature needed to be fluent in one common language. The advice given could be beneficial or malicious, and the target creature would be compelled to obey. The spell did not conceal the identity of the caster to the target.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[somatic component|somatic]] and [[material components]].
