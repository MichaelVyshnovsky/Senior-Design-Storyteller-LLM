        "mainbody": "'''''Thornbush arrows''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell turned regular thorns into magical missiles. A wu jen gathered thorns into their palm during casting, and shot the thorns out all at once. They could be spread out to strike multiple targets. The thorns were only effective against targets in the visual range of the caster, they could not follow or track a target.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[material component]]s. To cast the spell, a wu jen needed thorns from a plant such as a rose and the feather of a [[phoenix]]. During casting, the wu jen oscillated the feather over the thorns. The feather was destroyed during casting and rendered useless."
