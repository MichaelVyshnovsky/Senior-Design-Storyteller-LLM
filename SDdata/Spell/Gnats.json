        "Effects": "This cantrip conjured a small swarm of tiny flying insects that occupied a volume of {{SI|1|cu ft|c|long=yes}}. It appeared at a spot within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}<ref group=\"note\">The original description of this spell in [[Dragon magazine 60|''Dragon'' #60]] used the 1{{st}}-edition nomenclature <code>1\"</code>, meaning {{SI|10|ft}} indoors and {{SI|10|yd}} outdoors. This was simplified to the shorter range in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. and immediately formed a cloud around the head of the creature nearest to the summoning point. If the target did not resist the magic of this spell, they were distracted by the gnats for a few seconds before the bugs flew off. If the target successfully resisted, then they were essentially unaffected.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster pointed at the target while making a high-pitched sound, like the buzzing of tiny wings close to one's ear, using the tongue and upper palate."
