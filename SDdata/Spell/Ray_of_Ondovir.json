        "mainbody": "Ray of Ondovir was a spell that caused a glowing beam of energy to shoot forth from the caster, up to 240 (73.1 m) away, immobilizing a target and causing them to repeat their previous actions against their will. It was developed by the 7 century mage Rathdaen and first inscribed in his spellbook, the Tome of Rathdaen.\nA creature struck by the ray of Ondovir was immediately stunned and held in place. Unless they could resist the rays effects, they would then proceed to repeat any actions or movements they took prior to its casting in exactly the same manner. They did so with no consideration to their well being, possibly moving into dangerous situations or even their death.\nIf the target cast a spell prior to being affected by the ray of Ondovir, they would repeat the somatic and verbal components, which, unless they had an available preparation of the spell, wound up being empty gestures and words. If they were in the process of casting a spell or ritual with a lengthy casting time, the spell would be ruined, as they would merely repeat the actions they had taken prior to the rays effects."
