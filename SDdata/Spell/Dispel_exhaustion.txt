Dispel exhaustion was an arcane illusion spell that convinced others that they were well-rested.
This spell affected up to four targets at once, allowing them to attack and move as if under the influence of the haste spell for one minute every ten minutes. This spell also temporarily healed half of any physical harm experienced before the spell was cast. This recovered health was lost before the targets actual health if the targets were harmed while the spell was active.
A second casting of dispel exhaustion on a target already under the influence of the same spell would negate both spells.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
This spell was found within Selvars Ineffable Conjurations, Magicks, and Phantasms.
