'''''Find water''''' was a [[spell]] used by wizards in [[Anauroch]] and [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
With this spell the caster could literally smell a supply of water within a broad expanse of territory depending on their level of power. The caster was able to tell the direction, general distance, and whether or not the water was underground. This spell did not inform the caster if the water was potable or easily accessible.

==Components==
This spell required a drop of the caster's sweat, tears, or spittle to cast.
