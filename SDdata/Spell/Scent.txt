'''''Scent''''' was a [[transmutation]] spell that allowed the caster to confer a keen sense of smell to someone of their choosing.

==Effects==
A creature affected by ''scent'' gained an incredible boon to their olfactory sense, allowing them to identify unique scents in a manner similar to how humans differentiate different people and objects by sight. This sense was further heightened or diminished by wind.

They could readily sense approaching enemies, seek out hidden assailants and even track up to 30' (9.1 m) solely by their spoor. Strong odors such as rotten garbage, the must of a skunk or the fetor of a [[troglodyte]] could be detected as far as three times the normal distance.

==Casting==
The material component for this spell was a drop of sweat, along with a dash of both mustard and pepper.
