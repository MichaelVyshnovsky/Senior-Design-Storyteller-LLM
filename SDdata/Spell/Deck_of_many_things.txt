A deck of many things, also known as deck of hazards,
While each deck of many things was different, they held some common properties. The majority of decks found contained 13 cards, while approximately 1/4 of them held 22. They were typically made of vellum or ivory, but could also be cast from thin sheets of metal. They were often kept in a small pouch or ornate box.
The cards were named and each was adorned with a unique portrait that shimmered with a radiance of power. A 13-card deck included the sun, moon, star, throne, key, knight, the void, flames, skull, ruin, euryale, rogue and jester cards, while a 22-card deck added the vizier, comet, the fates, gem, talons, idiot, donjon, balance and fool.
While usually a deck of cards, a deck of many things could, on the rare occasion, come in another form, such as a circle of twenty two doorways, or a twenty two sided die.
The exact powers of each individual deck were not known until the cards were drawn. Before this, an individual declared how many cards they intended to draw. They did so randomly and had to wait one hour before drawing again. Any extraneously drawn cards had no effect and if an individual failed to draw the number of cards theyd previously declared, then all the remaining cards flew from the deck and took effect.

Once a card was successfully drawn, its magic immediately took effect and then it faded into oblivion, but instantly reappeared as part of the deck. This made it entirely possible that the same card was drawn more than once. The exception to this rule were the fool and jester cards, which truly disappeared once drawn.
The following effects were known to afflict, benefit, or otherwise change whoever drew the card
* Euryale The image of the medusa-like creature permanently cursed them. This effect could only be reversed by a deity or the magic of the fates card.
* Flames They earned the enmity of a formidable devil who sought their suffering and destruction. This hatred continued until they or the fiend died.In BGIISoA this card summoned an aggressive balor and four hostile fire elementals. Hostile action by the outsider was taken within one to twenty days of earning the enmity.
* Jester Great intuition and expertise were bestowed upon them in a similar manner as if they drew the sun card, albeit to a lesser extent. In addition they could draw two additional cards beyond those that they previously declared.In BGII SoA this card was replaced by erinyes that improved all their base attributes.
* Key A rare weapon, of a type with which they were proficient, appeared in the hands of the cards drawer.In BGII SoA, the weapon was replaced by the Warders Signet.
* Knight A powerful knight appeared and pledged their loyalty to them. This noble combatant believed that the fates had drawn them to that place and time.In BGII SoA this card summoned four hostile demon knights. This person and the drawer belonged to the same race and sex.
* Moon They gained the ability to cast the powerful spell wish in one to three instances.In Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn this card permanently increased their overall heartiness.
* Rogue A person close to the drawer of the card, or even a powerful figure or organization, became hostile towards them, though their identity was unknown to the drawer. This hatred could only be alleviated by a deitys intervention or the spell wish.In BGIISoA this card placed them under the effects of dire charm for over 40 days. The person who hated the drawer did not reveal their hatred until the most opportune time to cause the most trouble to the object of their hatred.
* Ruin They lost any and all wealth in their possession. While magical items were not affected in this manner, gold and other valuables disappeared. Any businesses, investments, land, or other holdings were also lost along with any corresponding documentation.
* Skull An avatar of death appeared before them. Before assaulting them with its scythe, the skeletal reaper warned anyone nearby that they were to engage in this fight alone. Anyone slain by the avatar of death could not be resurrected or otherwise brought back to life.In BGII SoA the avatar of death was replaced by a death shade. There was a chance of this card calling a jerul instead.
* Sun They were granted tremendous insight and skill as if they were much more experienced in their travels. In addition, they were granted a single wondrous item from anywhere throughout the Realms or other planes of existence.
* Star Two defining qualities of them were greatly and permanently enhanced. Such characteristics included their wit, intellect, fortitude, athletic ability, or other similar characteristics that helped define who they were as a person.
* The Void Their body was incapacitated and their soul was transported into a random object located somewhere. The location of the object was revealed to anyone nearby. The effects of this card could not be reversed by a wish spell.In BGII SoA this card disintegrated the drawer.
* Throne They became adept at influencing others to a heroic extent. Additionally some random keep located somewhere came into their rightful possession. However, the keep was infested with monstrous creatures that had to be expelled before it could be claimed. There were no recorded instances of any keeps appearing or having their ownership transferred by means of this magic.

* Balance Their alignment was reversed along the axes of both good versus evil and order versus chaos. No effects occurred if they were considered neutral or unaligned.In BGII SoA this card depicted a portrait of the decks creator. After the portrait smiled at the drawer the deck faded into nothingness. Furthermore, if the drawers actions did not meet the standards of the newly imposed ethical and moral outlook, the cards magic sapped the drawers life energy.
* Comet If they defeated the next hostile creature or group of individuals they encountered single-handedly they gained a great amount of insight from the battle. If this did not occur the card had no effect.In BGII SoA this card granted permanent protection against fire.
* Donjon They became imprisoned in a state of stasis within an extra-dimensional space somewhere in existence, in a manner similar to the spell imprisonment. All of their clothes, possessions and belongings remained at the location where they drew the card. They remained there until were discovered and recovered, however they could not be located by any divination magic and only by a casting of wish. Even if they previously declared, they drew no more cards. 
* Fool They lost understanding and competence in a manner opposite to those effects that were caused by the jester card. They drew another card from the deck, regardless of how many other draws they had declared.
* Gem A great cache of valuable gems appeared before them, in the form of 25 pieces of jewelry or 50 individual gem stones. The value of these riches totaled 50,000 gp.

* Puzzle (also known as the Idiot card)
* Sage (also known as the Vizier card)In BGII SoA this card placed them under the effects of the spell mantle for two hours.
* Talons Every magic item in their possession disintegrated. Any artifacts on their possession were not destroyed in this manner, but did vanish to some other location.In BGII SoA this card permanently blinded them.
* The fates They gained the ability to undo the fabric of time and reality, completely erasing one event from their life as if it never happened (including the eurayles curse). The effects of this card could be used immediately or anytime within their lifetime.

The original deck of many things in the whole multiverse was created by the Greyhawk god of luck, Istus, after a human woman named Asteria made a deal with them to save her friend, the medusa Euryale. Due to the divine nature of the cards, from then on myriad versions, each slightly different, started manifesting across the multiverse.
On Toril, the original decks of many things were created by the ancient Empire of Netheril. Then, these decks were nothing but decks of game cards known as decks of hazards. This casual deck-building game was played with slightly enchanted cards competitively. After the fall of Netheril, the magic contained in surviving decks steeped and swelled into the potent cards known across the Realms for their dangers and possible beneficial effects.
