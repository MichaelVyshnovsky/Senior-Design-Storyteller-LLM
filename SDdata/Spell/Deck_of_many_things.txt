A deck of many things, also known as deck of hazards,
While each deck of many things was different, they held some common properties. The majority of decks found contained 13 cards, while approximately 1/4 of them held 22. They were typically made of vellum or ivory, but could also be cast from thin sheets of metal. They were often kept in a small pouch or ornate box.
The cards were named and each was adorned with a unique portrait that shimmered with a radiance of power. A 13-card deck included the sun, moon, star, throne, key, knight, the void, flames, skull, ruin, euryale, rogue and jester cards, while a 22-card deck added the vizier, comet, the fates, gem, talons, idiot, donjon, balance and fool.
While usually a deck of cards, a deck of many things could, on the rare occasion, come in another form, such as a circle of twenty two doorways, or a twenty two sided die.
The exact powers of each individual deck were not known until the cards were drawn. Before this, an individual declared how many cards they intended to draw. They did so randomly and had to wait one hour before drawing again. Any extraneously drawn cards had no effect and if an individual failed to draw the number of cards theyd previously declared, then all the remaining cards flew from the deck and took effect.

These effects were imbued within the 22-card deck
* Balance Their alignment was reversed along the axes of both good versus evil and order versus chaos. No effects occurred if they were considered neutral or unaligned.In BGII SoA this card depicted a portrait of the decks creator. After the portrait smiled at the drawer the deck faded into nothingness. Furthermore, if the drawers actions did not meet the standards of the newly imposed ethical and moral outlook, the cards magic sapped the drawers life energy.
* Comet If they defeated the next hostile creature or group of individuals they encountered single-handedly they gained a great amount of insight from the battle. If this did not occur the card had no effect.In BGII SoA this card granted permanent protection against fire.
* Donjon They became imprisoned in a state of stasis within an extra-dimensional space somewhere in existence, in a manner similar to the spell imprisonment. All of their clothes, possessions and belongings remained at the location where they drew the card. They remained there until were discovered and recovered, however they could not be located by any divination magic and only by a casting of wish. Even if they previously declared, they drew no more cards. 
* Fool They lost understanding and competence in a manner opposite to those effects that were caused by the jester card. They drew another card from the deck, regardless of how many other draws they had declared.
* Gem A great cache of valuable gems appeared before them, in the form of 25 pieces of jewelry or 50 individual gem stones. The value of these riches totaled 50,000 gp.

A set of deck of hazards from Zhentil Keep, circa 1373 DR.
The original deck of many things in the whole multiverse was created by the Greyhawk god of luck, Istus, after a human woman named Asteria made a deal with them to save her friend, the medusa Euryale. Due to the divine nature of the cards, from then on myriad versions, each slightly different, started manifesting across the multiverse.
On Toril, the original decks of many things were created by the ancient Empire of Netheril. Then, these decks were nothing but decks of game cards known as decks of hazards. This casual deck-building game was played with slightly enchanted cards competitively. After the fall of Netheril, the magic contained in surviving decks steeped and swelled into the potent cards known across the Realms for their dangers and possible beneficial effects.
