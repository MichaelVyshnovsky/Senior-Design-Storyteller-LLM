'''''Morale''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s.

==Effects==
This spell had two distinct effects. The first effect increased the morale of multiple creatures for a short period of time. The caster could target any group that was within sight and {{SI|240|yd|long=yes}} from the caster.

The second effect increased the morale of a group of creatures for significantly longer, up to a day. This effect required more preparation on the part of the caster and had to be cast within {{SI|100|yd|long=yes}} of a holy place dedicated to the caster's deity.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], a [[gem]] with a value of at least 100 [[gp]]. It was destroyed after casting the spell.

==Trivia==
''Morale'' was one of the spells that the ''[[Flame of the Spirit]]'' might show devotees of Tymora.<ref>
