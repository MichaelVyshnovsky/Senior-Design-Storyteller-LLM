'''''Primal savagery''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[cantrip]] used by [[druid]]s to physically attack an opponent with magically sharpened, corrosive teeth and nails.

==Effects==
The spell briefly sharpened the caster's teeth or nails, imbuing them with [[acid]]ic properties. The druid then immediately attacked an opponent, delivering the acid with an intensity that increased as the caster grew in power. After the attack, the caster's body returned to normal.

==Components==
The spell only required a [[somatic component]].
