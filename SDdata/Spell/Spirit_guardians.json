        "Effects": "When cast, this spell summoned several spirits who protected the caster. They remained within {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} of the caster. The spirits matched the [[alignment]] of the caster. During casting, the caster could choose which creatures within the spell's area of affect would be unaffected by the spell. Otherwise, creatures within the area of effect slowed down and also suffered radiant or necrotic damage.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], the caster's holy symbol."
