        "mainbody": "Spirit guardians was a spell used by clerics.\nWhen cast, this spell summoned several spirits who protected the caster. They remained within  of the caster. The spirits matched the alignment of the caster. During casting, the caster could choose which creatures within the spells area of affect would be unaffected by the spell. Otherwise, creatures within the area of effect slowed down and also suffered radiant or necrotic damage.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, the casters holy symbol."
