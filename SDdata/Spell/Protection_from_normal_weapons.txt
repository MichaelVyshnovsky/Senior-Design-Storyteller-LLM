'''''Protection from normal weapons''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that protected the target from non-[[magic]]al weapons.

==Effects==
This spell actually refers to three separate spells, each associated with the three different types of normal weapons: ''[[protection from normal blunt weapons|blunt]]'', ''[[protection from normal edged weapons|edged]]'', and ''[[protection from normal missiles|missiles]]''. Each of the spells must have been learned and prepared separately, but could be applied to the same target. Those within 5 ft (1.5 m) of the target would also be protected.

==Components==
[[Verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material]] components were needed to cast the spell. The single material component was a broken [[weapon]] of the respective spell type.
