Protection from normal weapons was an abjuration spell that protected the target from non-magical weapons.
This spell actually refers to three separate spells, each associated with the three different types of normal weapons blunt, edged, and missiles. Each of the spells must have been learned and prepared separately, but could be applied to the same target. Those within 5 ft (1.5 m) of the target would also be protected.
Verbal, somatic, and material components were needed to cast the spell. The single material component was a broken weapon of the respective spell type.
