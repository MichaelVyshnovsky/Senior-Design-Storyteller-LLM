'''''Metal to rust''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
When cast, this spell allowed a wu jen to transform metal into rust. The metal was required to be ferrous. When applied to metal objects with magical properties, there was a chance the spell would fail. The spell was instantaneous: the metal began rusting upon a single touch of the wu jen, disintegrating into large flakes of rust. 

The reverse of this spell was ''[[rust to metal]]'', which reversed the effects of ''metal to rust''. It could also restore any rusted metal object, but it required nearly all of the original material to be present. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a vial of seawater or salt water.
