        "mainbody": "'''''Waterspout''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to priests of [[Umberlee]], the Bitch Queen, and [[cleric]]s of other deities that claimed the [[ocean domain|ocean]] as their domain. It created a towering column of water that could pick up objects and creatures, pummel them mercilessly, and then eject them high above the water level.",
        "Effects": "There were two divine versions of this spell, an earlier one used by priests of Umberlee\n\nThe earlier version could be cast at a point up to {{SI|330|ft|long=yes}} away, More experienced casters could extend this range even farther. When cast, a whirling cylinder of raging water rose up and could travel at a slow pace at the direction of the caster. All creatures and objects in its path were battered by the quickly rotating water, often with enough force to crush and shatter normal (non-magical) items and severely injure creatures that failed to dodge out of the way. Creatures hit by a ''waterspout'' were sucked into the column and spun about, taking further damage. Creatures that could not breathe water, were poor swimmers, or did not have the strength and constitution to hold their breath, stood a good chance of suffering death by drowning. Medium-sized creatures already in the water and within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the ''waterspout'' were sucked in unless they managed to maneuver away. The same fate met very small watercraft such as [[rowboat]]s or canoes, but the ''waterspout'' was not big enough to grab larger vessels.\n\nCreatures caught by a ''waterspout'' were battered, crushed, and suffocated until they reached the top of the water column and were flung about {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} in a random (horizontal) direction. If they were still alive at that point, the impact of their landing was another severe blow. Spellcasters had no chance to cast any spell until they were free of the ''waterspout'', and then only a quick spell or magic item activation was possible before the crash landing.\n\nIf the ''waterspout'' moved out of an area of sufficient depth, then it collapsed abruptly and all those trapped inside were subject to injury caused by falling. If the spell ended normally, then the water column slowly sank back into the source of water and caused no further harm.\n\nThe arcane version summoned a tornado in order to form the column of water. Thus it could be countered by appropriate [[School of elemental air|wind magic]] or the actions of an [[air elemental]].",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the early version of this spell required a drop of water blessed by Umberlee or one of her senior priests."
