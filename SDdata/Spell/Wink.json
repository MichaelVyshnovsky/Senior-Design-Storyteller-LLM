It caused a target creature to briefly close one eye.\nThis cantrip had a range of  and could affect one creature. If the target creature did not resist this spell, they involuntarily closed one eye for a second or two, resulting in a blatantly obvious wink. If they successfully resisted, then the eye closure was quick and not very noticeable.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster rapidly and surreptitiously closed one eye while speaking a magical phrase such as twenty-three skidoo.This phrase is from early 20-century American slang, best described by wikipedia."
