        "mainbody": "'''''Wink''''' was a person-affecting [[cantrip]] that [[wizard]]s-in-training could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It caused a target creature to briefly close one eye.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and could affect one creature. If the target creature did not resist this spell, they involuntarily closed one eye for a second or two, resulting in a blatantly obvious wink. If they successfully resisted, then the eye closure was quick and not very noticeable.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster rapidly and surreptitiously closed one eye while speaking a magical phrase such as ''twenty-three skidoo''.This phrase is from early 20{{th}}-century American slang, best described by [[wikipedia:23_skidoo_(phrase)|wikipedia]]."
