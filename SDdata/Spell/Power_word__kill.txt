'''''Power word, kill''''', formerly known as '''''Xanad's killer''''',

{{Quote|Aramil issued a long, heroic challenge, then the lich felled him with a single word.{{Cite MTG|AFR|114|[[Power word, kill|Power Word Kill]]|[[Izzy Medrano|Izzy]]}}}}

==Effects==
After the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the spell was able to instantly slay a single living creature in close range, under a certain, high degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed.

The postâ€“[[Second Sundering]] version of the spell could still kill a single creature instantly, provided it was not extremely powerful.

==Components==
The spell required only a [[verbal component]], the uttering of the power word itself.{{cite web|url= https://x.com/TheEdVerse/status/1817307625291407550|accessdate=2024-11-01 |author= Ed Greenwood|date= 28|year= 2024|month= July|format= Tweet||language= English}}, however, like with all spells, once a spellcaster understood how to cast it they could modify the word they used to be almost anything.{{cite web|url= https://x.com/TheEdVerse/status/1817371821886341553|title=Ed's Status|accessdate=2024-11-01 |author= Ed Greenwood|date= 28|year= 2024|month= July|format= Tweet||language= English}}

==History==
The spell was attributed to the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Xanad]] in the {{YearlinkName|-683}} and was originally called ''Xanad's killer''.{{cite web|url= https://x.com/TheEdVerse/status/1817300424367440319|title=Ed's Status|accessdate=2024-11-01 |author= Ed Greenwood|date= 28|year= 2024|month= July|format= Tweet||language= English}}
