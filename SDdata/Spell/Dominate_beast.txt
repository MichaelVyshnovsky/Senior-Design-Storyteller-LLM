Dominate beast or dominate animal was an enchantment spell that forced an animal to obey mental commands.
A dominated animal could be commanded with basic orders like "attack", "fetch" or "run", though it wouldnt obey obviously suicidal instructions or attack creatures much bigger than it.
The post Second Sundering version of the spell functioned much the same as the old version, except it would last for a minute unless cast with higher levels, all up to a maximum duration of 8 hours.
Only verbal and somatic components where needed for the casting of this spell.
