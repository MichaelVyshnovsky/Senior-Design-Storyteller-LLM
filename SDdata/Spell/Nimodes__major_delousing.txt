'''''Nimodes' major delousing''''' was a spell common amongst hedge wizards that protected against vermin.

==Effects==
The spell had to be cast on a point in space. It immediately slew all normal, nonmagical vermin within {{SI|60|feet|long=yes}} and prevented the entry of other insects for at least six hours, with more powerful mages generating longer-lived auras. Summoned insects were not affected.

==Components==
The spell called only for [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components.
