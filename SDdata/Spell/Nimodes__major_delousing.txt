Nimodes major delousing was a spell common amongst hedge wizards that protected against vermin.
The spell had to be cast on a point in space. It immediately slew all normal, nonmagical vermin within  and prevented the entry of other insects for at least six hours, with more powerful mages generating longer-lived auras. Summoned insects were not affected.
The spell called only for verbal and somatic components.
