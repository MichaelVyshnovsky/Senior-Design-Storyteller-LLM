        "mainbody": "Protection from petrification, 10 radius was a very rare abjuration spell that created a circle of protection making those within it immune to stone to flesh effects.\nWhen the caster touched a creature, they would create a protective circle around the target. All within 10 ft (3.0 m) would become immune to any forms of petrification. However, if any within the range reflected the spell, it would not affect the original spellcaster, as the spell was rendered inert.\nIf a creature had already been turned to stone, it did not free them from their stone form.\nAs well as verbal and somatic components, the material component consisted of a pinch of powdered gorgon scales. The powder had to be sprinkled in a circle around the caster.\nBefore the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, the Red Wizards of Thay were believed to have a similar, but not identical version of this spell.\nA simpler variant of this spell was found in a handful of places around the Sword Coast. This version of the spell only protected a single creature."
