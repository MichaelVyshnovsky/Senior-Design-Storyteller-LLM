        "mainbody": "'''''Protection from petrification, 10' radius''''' was a very rare [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that created a circle of protection making those within it immune to ''[[stone to flesh]]'' effects.",
        "Effects": "When the caster touched a creature, they would create a protective circle around the target. All within 10 ft (3.0 m) would become immune to any forms of petrification. However, if any within the range reflected the spell, it would not affect the original spellcaster, as the spell was rendered inert.\n\nIf a creature had already been turned to stone, it did not free them from their stone form.",
        "Components": "As well as [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the [[material]] component consisted of a pinch of powdered [[gorgon]] scales. The powder had to be sprinkled in a circle around the caster.",
        "Variants": "Before the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] were believed to have a similar, but not identical version of this spell.\n\nA simpler variant of this spell was found in a handful of places around the [[Sword Coast]]. This version of the spell only protected a single creature."
