'''''Float''''' was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]] that was only usable by [[wizard]]s. The undersea realm of [[Serôs]] had a [[divine magic|divine]] version of this spell, that the [[cleric]]s of the [[Elemental water sphere|elemental water]] and [[travelers sphere|traveler]] [[sphere]]s were able to cast.

==Effects==
This spell was used to make a recipient more buoyant in water, similar to a cork. Unless prevented from rising to the surface, air-breathing recipients were immune to drowning while under the influence of this spell. This spell could also be used on items to bring them to the surface of a body of water.

==Components==
This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, as well as a [[material component]] in the form of bit of cork that the wizard champed on when casting. The divine version of this spell required only a verbal component and a material one in the form of a cleric's [[holy symbol]].
