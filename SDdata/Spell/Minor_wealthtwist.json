        "mainbody": "Minor wealthtwist was a lesser version of the divine magic spell wealthtwist, granted to specialty priests and other followers of Waukeen. It converted material wealth directly into a beneficial spell.\nThis spell operated in the same manner as wealthtwist except there were fewer beneficial spells that could be cast. This spell could transform coins, gems, and/or trade bars into one of the following beneficial spells cure blindness or deafness, cure disease, cure light wounds, cure serious wounds, or neutralize poison. The amount of wealth consumed was directly proportional to the level of the beneficial spell being cast, at a rate of 250 gold pieces per level of the spell.\nThe boon was chosen by the caster and he or she had to touch the payment as part of the casting of minor wealthtwist. If the value of the monetary sacrifice was insufficient for the spell effect chosen, the caster was immediately aware of this and either had to choose a lesser spell, or touch more funds within two minutes of the casting. Otherwise, the minor wealthtwist spell was wasted. Upon receipt of sufficient payment, the beneficial spell was then cast on a person or creature (possibly the caster) by touch.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell consumed a quantity of coins, gems, and/or trade bars of sufficient value to cast the desired beneficial spell.\nThis spell was typically used on merchants that worshiped Waukeen and donated money to the church."
