Move dune was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell allowed the caster to lift and move a large heap of sand, dust, or gravel. The spell was only able to move non-living matter. Stronger casters were able to move more material. If dropped, the matter created an effect similar to a sand shield.
This spell required a pinch of sand to cast.
