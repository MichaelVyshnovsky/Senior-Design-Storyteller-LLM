'''''Faithful mount''''' was a [[charm]] [[spell]], within the greater [[enchantment]] [[school of magic]], that allowed a [[cleric]] to enjoy a strong and permanent bond with a [[mount]] of their choosing.

==Effects==
Upon casting this spell, a specific mount was placed under the effects of the spells ''[[charm mammal]]'' and ''[[speak with animals]]''. They became exceptionally loyal to the spell's caster and could converse with and understand them as if they spoke the same language. While the effects of the spell were permanent, it was possible that the targeted animal could resist its effects, whereby it was permanently immune to any further castings by the same cleric or [[priest]].

This spell affected a number of animals that could be ridden as mounts including [[mule]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[ponies]], [[horse]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, [[elephant]]s, [[hippogriff]]s, [[griffon]]s, [[pegasi]], and even [[unicorn]]s.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a small lump of sugar in order to be cast.
