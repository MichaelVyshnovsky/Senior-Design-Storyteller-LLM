        "mainbody": "Phezults sleep of ages was a spell which created a protective sphere of suspended animation.\nAfter casting, a spherical stasis field would slowly expand out from the \"spell focus\" until it reached its maximum spherical volume. Other than the caster, any other creatures in the sphere ran the risk of being placed in suspended animation. Although body functions of those trapped cease, they do not die, starve or age. Those in the sphere can be attacked or killed by conventional means, at which point their body will start to decay.\nTrying to contact a creature stuck inside the sphere using psionics or magic will yield no response, and the creature attempting the contact will find themselves in stasis for a short time.\nIndividuals can be freed of the spell by casting temporal reinstatement or the reverse of this spell, Phezults awakening.\nTo create the \"spell focus\" required at least nine drops of the casters own blood, The blood had to be smeared into an unbroken ring no larger than the casters hand. Six gems of at least 500 gp value then had to be placed inside the ring.\nThe value of the gems power the sphere, with roughly a year of stasis being yielded per 10 gp of gem value. Removing gems will instantly end the stasis. Adding gems will extend the duration of the stasis.\nThe spell was invented by the powerful mage Phezult in Myth Drannor some time in the 8th century DR to allow the citys Guild of Naturalists to keep animals and monsters for study.\nIn , under the leadership of a half-dwarf named Bryth Moonaxe, the Knights of the Crescent Moon were voluntarily frozen in a Phezults sleep of ages spell. They were released in 1370 DR."
