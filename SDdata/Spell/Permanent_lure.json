        "mainbody": "'''''Permanent lure''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] from the [[charm sphere|charm]] and [[necromantic sphere]]s that changed a single feature on the caster's body to match that of a creature they had seen.",
        "Effects": "The casting [[priest]] could only have one ''permanent lure'' active at any given time. The desired change needed to be something natural to the caster's race and gender. A ''permanent lure'' lasted for several years depending on the skill of the caster, but could be removed early with the successful casting of three ''[[dispel magic]]'' spells or by a ''[[wish]]'' or ''[[limited wish]]''. Attempting to place a second ''permanent lure'' when one was already active resulted in both changed features melting away, leaving those areas of the body terribly disfigured.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a [[gemstone]] worth at least 500 [[gp]], a vial of [[holy water]], and a piece of the caster's skin to cast.",
        "History": "This rare spell was granted by [[Sune]], the [[goddess]] of beauty."
