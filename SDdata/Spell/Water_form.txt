Water form was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell transformed the caster or recipient into a creature made from elemental water. The recipients mind remained the same. While in water form, the recipient could go through any location that water would fit through including small cracks and crevices. The recipient was invisible when submerged in water.
Piercing or slashing weapons did not cause nearly as much damage while in water form, but blunt weapons caused regular damage. Exposure to full sunlight caused minor evaporation damage. The recipient was immune to poison or gas attacks and did not need to eat or breathe while in water form.
Fire-based attacks against the recipient were not as effective, but lighting-based attacks were more effective.
This spell required an eyedropper to cast.
