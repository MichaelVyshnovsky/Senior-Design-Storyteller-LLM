Ray of resurgence was an evocation spell that produced a beam that restored strength and energy.
A glowing ray of yellow light projected from the casters hand and struck a creature in close range. It never missed and functioned up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) away, or more for more experienced casters. It had a rejuvenating effect, by healing damage to the creatures strength or alleviating effects that sapped strength, and by reducing or eliminating fatigue and exhaustion.
It required verbal and somatic components.
