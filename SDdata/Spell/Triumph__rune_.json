        "mainbody": "riumph was a type of giant rune, similar to the death rune, that allowed whoever wielded its inscribed object to inflict greater damage.\nWhenever an inscribed weapon struck a creature, it would inflict twice the amount of damage it normally would. This effect would only last for the duration of a single battle.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to three hours and it needed to be inscribed upon the blade of a weapon."
