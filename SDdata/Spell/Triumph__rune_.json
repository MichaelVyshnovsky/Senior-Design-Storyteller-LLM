        "mainbody": "'''''Triumph''''' was a type of [[giant]] rune, similar to the ''[[death (rune)|death]]'' rune, that allowed whoever wielded its inscribed object to inflict greater damage.",
        "Effects": "Whenever an inscribed weapon struck a creature, it would inflict twice the amount of damage it normally would. This effect would only last for the duration of a single battle.",
        "Components": "Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to three hours and it needed to be inscribed upon the blade of a [[weapon]]."
