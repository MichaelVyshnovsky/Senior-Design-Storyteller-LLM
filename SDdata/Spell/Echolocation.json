        "mainbody": "Echolocation was a divine alteration spell from the elemental water sphere that allowed the caster to perceive their underwater surroundings via sound.\nThis spell provided the caster with a clear image of all surfaces and objects within  in any direction while they were underwater. Concealed doors were also revealed. The caster could perform other oral actions while the spell remained active provided they periodically sent out another blast of sound with their mouth.\nEcholocation could also be used offensively by focusing the sound into a tight beam that physically harmed a single target and stunned them for several minutes.\nThis spell was incredibly taxing on the casters vocal chords, preventing any form of speech for one hour after following the spells expiration.\nThis spell required only verbal components to cast."
