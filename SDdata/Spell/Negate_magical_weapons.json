        "Effects": "For the duration of the spell, any [[:Category:Magic weapons|magical weapon]] that struck a person or creature did so as if it were a mundane version of the same weapon-type. Furthermore, any spell-like abilities or effects produced by these weapons had no effect on the being under the spell's protection.\n\nThe spell did not negate any powers of weapons that did not directly target its recipient and offered some protection from weapons with the ''special purpose'' of defeating [[arcane spellcaster]]s. While it negated the extra damage these weapons could cause, it did nothing to stop the effects they caused, such as ''[[blindness]]'' or ''[[deafness]]''."
