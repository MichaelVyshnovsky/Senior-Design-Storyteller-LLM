        "mainbody": "Celestial blood was an abjuration spell that granted the subject divine defenses.\nThe caster channeled holy power and bestowed on the subject a little of the protections normally found in celestial beings. They acquired resilience to acid, cold, and electricity a strong fortitude against poisons and reduced injuries (though this was overcome by evil).\nAlong with verbal and somatic components, the caster anointed the subjects head with a vial of holy water."
