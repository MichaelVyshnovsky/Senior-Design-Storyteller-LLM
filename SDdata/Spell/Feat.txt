'''''Feat''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Tymora]], enabling them to execute an extremely difficult task.

==Effects==
The caster of this spell could use it on themselves or a single touched target, allowing them to perform a single incredible task. The spell's magic did not protect the target from physical harm, it merely ensured that the task at hand would be completed successfully. The ''feat'' would even be accomplished if the target died as a result of their actions, animating the target's lifeless body to complete the task. The ''feat'' in question needed to be attempted within one minute of casting the spell.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
