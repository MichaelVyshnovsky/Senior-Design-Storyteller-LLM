Darts of bone was a necromancy spell that created nine bone darts.
The bone darts created by this spell, which acted as +3 projectiles, could be thrown at the casters opponents. The darts would cause instant damage to a foe, as well as heavy secondary damage, should the opponents be unable to resist. When struck, the creatures strength would be largely reduced for thirty seconds.
