'''''Darts of bone''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that created nine bone [[dart]]s.

==Effects==
The bone darts created by this spell, which acted as ''+3'' projectiles, could be thrown at the caster's opponents. The darts would cause instant damage to a foe, as well as heavy secondary damage, should the opponents be unable to resist. When struck, the creature's strength would be largely reduced for thirty seconds.
