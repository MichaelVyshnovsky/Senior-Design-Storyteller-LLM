        "mainbody": "Aumvors fragmented phylactery was a spell of epic magic that only liches could cast.\nNormally, liches had only one phylactery. To permanently destroy a lich, a person needed to destroy both the lich and the phylactery. Aumvors fragmented phylactery allowed a caster to expand the number of phylacteries, thus forcing the lichs enemies to destroy all phylacteries, so permanently destroying the lich became almost impossible.\nAumvors fragmented phylactery could be used in either of two ways. The spell could be cast on an existing phylactery to split it into multiple ones or it could be cast to create various items to be turned into phylacteries. While this spell could be cast various times, there was a limit to how many phylacteries could be created at once the number depended on the casters power behind the spell.\nAumvors fragmented phylactery required somatic and verbal components to cast. Casting it took an entire minute.\nAumvors fragmented phylactery was a product of Aumvors research in epic magic. It was developed after the Fall of Netheril.\nHe used the spell on his phylactery, a rune-scribed skeleton of his former rival Dethed, an apprentice of Ioulaum. He cast it so often that the skeletons 206 bones were phylacteries. Most of them were shrouded from divination magic and scattered around the Endless Caverns and other places, but most were in the former place."
