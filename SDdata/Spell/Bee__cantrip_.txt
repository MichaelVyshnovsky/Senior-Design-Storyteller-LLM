'''''Bee''''' was a personal [[cantrip]] that [[wizard]]s-in-training could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It summoned an angry honey bee to a spot chosen by the caster.

==Effects==
This cantrip conjured a single honey [[bee]] that appeared at a spot within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}<ref group="note">The original description of this spell in [[Dragon magazine 60|''Dragon'' #60]] used the 1{{st}}-edition nomenclature <code>1"</code>, meaning {{SI|10|ft}} indoors and {{SI|10|yd}} outdoors. This was simplified to the shorter range in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. and visible to the caster (that is, it could not be inside a pouch or under clothing, for example). The insect was irritated by the summoning and was highly likely to sting if it appeared on or very close to a living creature.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster focused their vision on the desired target spot, made a soft buzzing sound, and traced a wandering path in the air similar to the flight of a bee.
