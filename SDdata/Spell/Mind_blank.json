        "mainbody": "Mind blank was a powerful abjuration spell that rendered the subject invisible to scrying and immune to magic that manipulated the mind and emotions.\nA single target being was completely safeguarded against all mind-affecting spells effects and spells that could detect, affect, or read their thoughts and emotions. It also shielded them from divination spells and similar effects that could be used to obtain information. Scrying spells that targeted them directly failed. Those that viewed an area, like arcane eye, would succeed but not register the shielded being. Even mighty spells like miracle, limited wish, and wish made to gain information about the being or influence their mind were prevented.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Kutson in  and was originally called Kutsons mind blank."
