        "mainbody": "'''''Mind blank''''' was a powerful [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that rendered the subject invisible to [[scrying]] and immune to [[magic]] that manipulated the mind and emotions.",
        "Effects": "A single target being was completely safeguarded against all [[:Category:Charm spells|mind-affecting spells]] effects and spells that could detect, affect, or read their thoughts and emotions. It also shielded them from [[divination]] spells and similar effects that could be used to obtain information. Scrying spells that targeted them directly failed. Those that viewed an area, like ''[[arcane eye]]'', would succeed but not register the shielded being. Even mighty spells like ''[[miracle]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', and ''[[wish]]'' made to gain information about the being or influence their mind were prevented.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Kutson]] in {{Yearlink|-1174}} and was originally called '''''Kutson's mind blank'''''."
