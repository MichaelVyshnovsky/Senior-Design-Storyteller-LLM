        "mainbody": "Guardian hammer was a spell used by clerics of Berronar Truesilver.\nThis spell was used to guard an area such as a door. When triggered by a living creature, the spell activated. An invisible field of force in the shape of a large hammer flew towards the closest living creature. While the spell was only capable of triggering once, it did not miss a target. Physical and magical barriers would not stop the hammer from striking a target The creature unlucky enough to be struck by the hammer suffered injury as well as being temporarily stunned.\nA guardian hammer spell could be deactivated with dispel magic. Completely destroying the area guarded by the spell also rendered it useless.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, sweat or a tear from the caster, a lock of hair from a dwarven stonemason and either a pebble or piece of ice."
