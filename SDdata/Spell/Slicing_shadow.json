        "mainbody": "Slicing shadow was a divine evocation spell that conjured a cloud of harmful smoke and darkness.\nWhen this spell was cast, a cleric created a stationary cloud of shadowy smoke. Within the cloud were a number of black tendrils of darkness that lashed out at any nearby persons or creatures.\nThe caster could end the spell prematurely if they wished.\nThis spell appeared upon the inside of the Mask of Mysteries when the proper actions were taken by its wearer.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast."
