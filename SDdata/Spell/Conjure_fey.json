        "Effect": "This spell summoned a fey creature of some power; the creature considered the caster and its allies friendly. The creature followed the caster's orders and would fight until it \"died\", unless these orders were against its ideals or the caster lost concentration, in which case the creature would consider the caster and its allies as hostile.\n\nThe creature remained with the caster for an hour or until it \"died\", at this point it would disappear. If cast as a higher level spell, then the summoned creature could become even more powerful.",
        "Components": "Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components where needed to cast this spell."
