        "mainbody": "Stalk was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Mielikki, the Supreme Ranger, enabling them to mask their presence. Priests of Gwaeron Windstrom, the Tracker, Eilistraee, the Dark Maiden, also had access to this spell.\nThis spell allowed the caster to appear almost completely silent and invisible in rural settings. The casters scent and heat signature were also masked, rendering them unseen to infravision. If they stayed still, they were utterly undetectable by natural senses to , but if they moved, then there was a slight chance they could be noticed by those with very sharp senses. The spell would expire in a number of minutes according to the casters experience or until the caster made an attack.\nIn addition to verbal components, this spell required as material components a piece of dried lizard or chameleon skin and the priests holy symbol to cast.\nIt was recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki."
