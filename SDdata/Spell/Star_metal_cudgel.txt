'''''Star metal cudgel''''' was a [[spell]] from the [[conjuration]] school of magic, used by [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell conjured a bludgeon made out of meteoric iron into the caster's hands. A ''star metal cudgel'' remained in the caster's hands for 180 seconds or until dismissed. This magical weapon had a potent ''+2'' enchantment to its damage and a potent ''+4'' magic that guided the caster's hand toward the target. This summoned weapon was especially deadly when wielded against [[undead]] creatures and [[construct]]s.
