'''''Epic gate''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] of [[epic magic]], granted to or developed and used by some of the most powerful [[arcane scholars of Candlekeep]], [[arcane trickster]]s, [[bard]]s, [[cleric]]s, [[druid]]s, [[eldritch knight]]s, [[favored soul]]s, [[Harper agent]]s, [[pale master]]s, [[Red Wizard]]s, [[sacred fist]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, [[spirit shaman]]s, [[stormlord]]s, [[warlock]]s, [[warpriest]]s, and [[wizard]]s, who were masters of spellcraft and could access the 9{{th}} circle of magic.

==Effects==
With the spell's utterance, a ''[[gate]]'' to the [[lower planes]] opened, summoning a [[balor]] forth. The sheer power of the spellcaster was such that the summoned balor was under their full control without a need to cast ''[[protection from evil]]'' or similar spells. The summoning lasted for four full minutes with the balor disappearing afterwards. If the summoned balor was killed, another one took its place immediately.

==Components==
To cast ''epic gate'', the caster had to use [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components.
