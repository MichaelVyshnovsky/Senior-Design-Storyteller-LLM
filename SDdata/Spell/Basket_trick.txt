}}'''''Basket trick''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was usable only by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
''Basket trick'' was similar to the ''[[blink]]'' spell. When cast, it allowed the caster to move about randomly to avoid injury. After casting, the caster randomly [[teleport]]ed to nearby baskets. The caster would continue to teleport for several minutes or until she or he deemed it safe to venture forth from the basket. Material filling a basket to which the caster teleported was instantly transported to the original basket.

==Components==
The material component needed to cast this spell was a large basket or urn into which the caster climbed before casting the spell.
