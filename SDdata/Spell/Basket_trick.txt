Basket trick was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was usable only by wizards.
Basket trick was similar to the blink spell. When cast, it allowed the caster to move about randomly to avoid injury. After casting, the caster randomly teleported to nearby baskets. The caster would continue to teleport for several minutes or until she or he deemed it safe to venture forth from the basket. Material filling a basket to which the caster teleported was instantly transported to the original basket.
The material component needed to cast this spell was a large basket or urn into which the caster climbed before casting the spell.
