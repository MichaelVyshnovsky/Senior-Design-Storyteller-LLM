Slippers or boots of spider climbing were magical boots that allowed their wearer to effortlessly walk on vertical surfaces, or upside-down along ceilings, leaving their hands free.
Often unremarkable in appearance, slippers of spider climbing gave off a faint aura of alteration magic.
Slippers of spider climbing were typically not effective on slippery surfaces, such as ice, or surfaces coated in oil or grease. Following the Spellplague, boots of spiders climbing lost their sticky properties, instead merely enhancing their wearers ability to climb. However, the item was reverted to its traditional state after the Second Sundering.
