'''''Energy transformation''''' was a complex [[alteration]] [[spell]] that created a permanent [[arcane]] field that absorbed [[magic]]al energies and transferred them to other existing spell effects, thereby extending their duration.

==Effects==
The magical field created by the spell spell was a {{SI|40|ft}} radius sphere centered upon a single location. Within that area of effect, the energy released by any cast spells was absorbed and its effects were greatly diminished. Furthermore, any [[Item enchantment|magical]] items that possessed outwardly-expressed spell-like effects began to function in an inconsistent manner, as the magical power within them was similarly consumed. For example a [[torch]] [[alteration|altered]] with the spell ''[[continual light]]'' would flicker when it was carried through the zone affected by the spell ''energy transformation''.

This spell did not effect any spells or items whose magic originated from the [[abjuration]] or [[conjuration]] [[schools of magic]]. It caused no damage or degenerative effects to magical items that did not possess spell-like functions.

The area of absorption created by this spell could only be destroyed by the spells ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'' or ''[[wish]]''.

==Casting==
When ''energy transformation'' was cast, the caster had to specifically name the existing magic to which the spell's area of effect was linked. They also had to outline any limitations that were to be expressed within the absorption field.

In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a number of [[material component]]s. It required three "permanent" magical items, which were consumed during the spell's casting; three drops of the caster's blood; a single eyeball extracted from a living creature; and a [[diamond]], worth at least 5000 [[gp]], which was ground into a fine powder. It took just under half a minute for this spell to be cast.

==Usage==
This spell was used extensively by the "Mad Mage" [[Halaster Blackcloak]], especially throughout the corridors of the [[Undermountain]]. Its labyrinthine halls were layered with overlapping absorption fields that furthered the myriad of [[enchantment]]s and spells that protected Halaster's lair from magical [[scrying]] and [[divination]].
