Curse of ill fortune was a spell used by clerics of Beshaba.
When cast, this spell temporarily cursed a targeted creature. The curse generally weakened the target. The curse could be lifted by any spell that also removed bestow curse.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a divine focus.
