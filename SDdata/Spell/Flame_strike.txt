Flame strike was an evocation spell that blasted a target with divine fire.
A vertical column of fire was called down by the caster on the exact spot indicated when the spell was cast. Those caught in the target area were engulfed in flames but could partially resist the spell if they were lucky or escape part of the damage if they were dexterous.
There were at least two distinct versions of this spell through the ages. The older version filled a cylinder 10 ft (3 m) wide by 30 ft (9.1 m) tall with fire and did an average amount of damage regardless of the level of the caster. The newer version blasted an area 20 ft (6.1 m) wide by 40 ft (12.2 m) tall and the average damage increased with the experience of the caster. The divine fire was made up of half fire and half divine power, so protections like fire shield (chill shield) and protection from energy (fire) only applied to the fire half.
The newer version required verbal and somatic components as well as a holy symbol or divine focus for casting. The older version and the post-Second Sundering version also required a pinch of sulfur.
