        "mainbody": "'''''Fire lance''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that shot forth a jet of flames that resembled the [[lance]] of a mounted warrior.",
        "Effects": "In effect, the [[spellcaster]] extinguished the flame that was used as a component of the spell's casting, shaped it to their will and fired it as a projectile towards a target person or creature. While the ''fire lance'' was particularly harmful to its target, it did not damage their clothing nor their possessions.",
        "Casting": "The spell was cast with [[verbal]], [[somatic]] and material components, the latter of which was a lit [[torch]] or similar source of natural fire.",
        "Usage": "This spell was quite popular among the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] during the latter half of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
