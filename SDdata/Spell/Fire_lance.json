        "mainbody": "Fire lance was an evocation spell that shot forth a jet of flames that resembled the lance of a mounted warrior.\nIn effect, the spellcaster extinguished the flame that was used as a component of the spells casting, shaped it to their will and fired it as a projectile towards a target person or creature. While the fire lance was particularly harmful to its target, it did not damage their clothing nor their possessions.\nThe spell was cast with verbal, somatic and material components, the latter of which was a lit torch or similar source of natural fire.\nThis spell was quite popular among the Red Wizards of Thay during the latter half of the 14 century DR."
