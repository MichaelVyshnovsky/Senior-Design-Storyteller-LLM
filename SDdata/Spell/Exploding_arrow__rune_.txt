'''''Exploding arrow''''' was an offensive type of [[giant]] rune that affected ''arrows''.

==Effects==
When affected by this rune an ''arrow'' would explode upon impacting something, causing severe damage. If a caster extensively studied this rune a second time, then the explosive effect would be even more devastating.

==Components==
Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune ''[[death (rune)|death]]''. The process of shaping this rune generally took around one to four minutes and it needed to be inscribed upon an ''arrow''.
