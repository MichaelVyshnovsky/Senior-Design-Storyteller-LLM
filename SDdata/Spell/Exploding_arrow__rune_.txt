Exploding arrow was an offensive type of giant rune that affected arrows.
When affected by this rune an arrow would explode upon impacting something, causing severe damage. If a caster extensively studied this rune a second time, then the explosive effect would be even more devastating.
Like most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune death. The process of shaping this rune generally took around one to four minutes and it needed to be inscribed upon an arrow.
