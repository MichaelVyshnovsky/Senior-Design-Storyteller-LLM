        "mainbody": "Call hounds was a divine cleric spell granted by the hin deity Urogalan the Protector.\nUpon being cast, the spell summoned a pair of black hounds that materialized anywhere within  from the caster. Sent by Urogalan, these dogs were completely loyal to the cleric who summoned them. These fearsome black wards were smarter than an average beast and were intelligent enough to follow complex commands and instructions. The only way to break the casters control over the jet hounds was by means of the wish spell or the meddling of another deity. The more powerful the caster was, the longer the spell lasted.\nCall hounds could not be dispelled and the only way of ending it was by slaying the summoned dogs, via the banishment spell, or by killing or knocking the caster out.\nThe summoned hounds could not perform any tasks that went against the teachings and dogma of Urogalan, and if ordered to do so, they simply vanished.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material components were the casters holy symbol and a silver whistle, priced at at least 50 gold pieces. The cleric had to blow the whistle to perform the spell and it did not consume this material component.\n* Grimwardens, specialty priests of Urogalan, were given the ability to cast the spell."
