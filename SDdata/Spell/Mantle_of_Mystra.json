        "mainbody": "Mantle of Mystra was a divine abjuration spell that created a protective aura around the caster.\nWhen cast, the mantle protected the caster from a single, specific spell or spell-like effect. It absorbed the effects of the spell, or magical item discharge, then launched a single spell of the same power towards the caster of the offensive spell. The spell the caster was protected from, along with the spell that was \"reflected\" back, were both chosen by caster of mantle of Mystra.\nThe protection of the mantle lasted for a full year, until it was triggered by a spells effects. Dispel magic didnt trigger the mantles effects but effectively removed the protection it conferred.\nMultiple castings of the spell could not be placed on the same individual at the same time, nor did they combine with the effects of greater mantle of Mystra.\nThe specifications of this spell could be displayed by the relic known as the Scepter of Mystra.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast."
