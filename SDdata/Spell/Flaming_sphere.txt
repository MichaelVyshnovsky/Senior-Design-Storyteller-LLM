Flaming sphere was a conjuration spell that summoned a globe of hot flames  in diameter, which the caster could then move at a speed roughly equivalent to that of a walking human. The spheres flames were volatile and any creature caught nearby that was unable to get out of the way was scorched.
The pre-Spellplague version of the sphere lasted for a few minutes, but could last longer the more powerful the caster. Between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering, the sphere dissipated almost immediately after casting on its own, although with a little effort the wizard could maintain the sphere for several minutes or cause it to flare up again. Once the sphere was gone, however, the wizard was unable to reconjure it without substantial rest.  The post-Second Sundering version lasted for up to one minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating on the spell.
The sphere burned any flammable material it touched, but did not cause damage by movement, as its surface was spongy. It could not push other objects aside, but it could float over furniture or low walls. 
The spell required verbal, somatic and material components. The materials required were powdered iron, tallow, and brimstone.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Primidon in  and was originally called Primidons sphere.
It was considered a druid, sorcerer, and wizard spell in the school of evocation prior to the Spellplague, and a wizard spell in the school of conjuration following those events and into the postâ€“Second Sundering era.
