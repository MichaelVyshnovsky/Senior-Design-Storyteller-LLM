        "mainbody": "Distilled joy was a transmutation spell used to create ambrosia, The spell was common among clerics following the goddess Lliira\nAfter an entire day of preparation, the caster had to touch someone in a moment of true joy, such as from the bliss of true love, the passion of a sexual encounter, the creative spark of an artist, or the daydream of a dryad. Once created, the ambrosia lasted until consumed.\nThe distilled joy spell required verbal and somatic components and the container to collect the ambrosia, usually a tiny vial."
