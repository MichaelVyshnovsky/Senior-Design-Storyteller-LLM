        "mainbody": "Summon undead V, also known as undead summoning V, was the most powerful of the series of summon undead spells available to arcane casters in the Realms.\nThis spell could summon a mummy, a shadow, a vampire spawn or a wight. As an alternative, the spell could summon one to three allips or ghasts, two to five ghouls, two to five huge, large, or medium-sized skeletons, or two to five large, medium-sized, or small zombies&mdashprovided they were all within 30 feet of each other. \nIf ghasts, ghouls, or shadows were summoned, the spell was considered a chaotic spell in addition to an evil one. If a mummy or wight was summoned, it was a lawful spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a piece of bone from either a lich, mummy or vampire.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
