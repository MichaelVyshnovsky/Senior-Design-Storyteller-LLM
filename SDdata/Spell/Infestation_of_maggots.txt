Infestation of maggots was a necromancy spell used by druids in the realms.
By touching an opponent, a druid casting this spell would cause an infestation of maggot-like creatures to cover the target creature. These maggots would slowly drain ones constitution unless resisted or removed by a remove disease or heal spell. Otherwise, they would naturally die off once the duration of the spell ended.
Unlike most druidic spells, this spell required a handful of dessicated flies as a material component, in addition to verbal and somatic components.
