'''''Irritation''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that affected the skin.
 
==Effects==
This spell had two effects which that caster could choose from. The first effect caused instant and debilitating itching sensation on a target creature's skin. It could be used to interrupt another from casting a spell. The other effect caused a targeted creature's skin to break out in red rashes that also itched. The rashes were persistent after the spell expired, after which only ''[[cure disease]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'' or ''[[merciful touch]]'' spells could remove the rashes and stop the itching. Creatures with thick or insensitive skin were unaffected by either effects of this spell. The spell could affect up to four creatures within {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} from the caster. 

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, a leaf from either [[poison ivy]], poison oak or [[poison sumac]].

==History==
The spell was invented by the wicked [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Jarm]]  in {{Yearlink|-1894}}.
