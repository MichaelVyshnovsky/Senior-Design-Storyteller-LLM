'''''Hither''''' was a rare [[arcane]] [[spell]] from the [[conjuration]] school of magic, used by [[rogue|roguish]] [[wizard]]s on the world of [[Oerth]] to fetch items from a distance.

==Effects==
When cast, ''hither'' made one object of the mage's choosing leap forth into their hands unerringly from somewhere on their person. The size and weight of the item summoned via the spell depended on the caster's size and strength â€“ it affected only items that the caster could comfortably hold in their hands. These items could only be of a non-magical nature. In a similar manner, the object could be returned via the ''hither'' spell into the caster's pockets, bags, [[scabbard]]s, or other places of their choosing. When an item was called via this spell, items moved from and to without disturbing any other objects, leaving bags closed, coins or keys silent, etc. The ''hither'' spell could be done silently or accompanied by an audible swoosh, a melodic chime, or a flash of light, as desired by the caster.

==Components==
''Hither'' required only [[verbal component]]s to be cast.

==History==
The ''Hither'' spell was known to [[Rautheene]] of Greyhawk, and it was among the spells exchanged between the members of [[The Wizards Three]] during their visit to [[Earth]] and raiding larders of [[Ed Greenwood]] of Canada. The spell was brought over to the world of [[Toril]] by [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]], a member of the same de facto group.{{Cite dragon/242/Jest the Wizards Three|50}}
