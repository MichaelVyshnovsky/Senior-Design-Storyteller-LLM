        "mainbody": "Moon bolt was an evocation spell used by Silverhair Knights.\nWhen cast, the caster conjured a bolt composed of shimmering moonlight, which was launched from their extended hand to strike a designated target, be it a living or undead creature, within . The range increased with the casters skill level. The trajectory of the moon bolt was unerring, reaching its intended target without fail.\nUpon impact, the targeted creature suffered physical harm and became temporarily prone, immobile, and defenseless.\nWhen this spell was cast under the open sky at night, the caster gained the ability to generate an additional moon bolt. This secondary bolt could either be aimed at the same target or a different one, provided the second target was no more than  away from the initial target.\nThis spell required a verbal and somatic components."
