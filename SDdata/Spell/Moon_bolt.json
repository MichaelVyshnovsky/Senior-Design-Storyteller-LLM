        "mainbody": "'''''Moon bolt''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by [[Silverhair Knights]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, the caster conjured a bolt composed of shimmering moonlight, which was launched from their extended hand to strike a designated target, be it a living or [[undead]] creature, within {{SI|400|ft|long=yes}}. The range increased with the caster's skill level. The trajectory of the moon bolt was unerring, reaching its intended target without fail.\n\nUpon impact, the targeted creature suffered physical harm and became temporarily prone, immobile, and defenseless.\n\nWhen this spell was cast under the open sky at night, the caster gained the ability to generate an additional moon bolt. This secondary bolt could either be aimed at the same target or a different one, provided the second target was no more than {{SI|15|ft|long=es}} away from the initial target.",
        "Components": "This spell required a [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components."
