'''''Disguise''''' was an illusion/phantasm spell that was also known to the school of alteration. Variations of this spell were known in other lands and other traditions. It was very rare outside of [[Maztica]] and [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
The spell variation used by wu jens allowed the caster to mimic the appearance of another person. The illusion only worked if the target was of the same species and known to the wu jen. The caster took on the face, body shape, mannerisms, and voice of the subject. However, the spell was unable to duplicate any abilities or magical skills of the target.

This spell was vulnerable to detection by ''[[detect illusion]]'' or ''[[detect magic]]'' spells, and if someone was familiar with the target, such as a family member, there was a chance they could see through the ''disguise''.

The spell variation used by hishnashapers allowed the caster to hide their appearance. The caster was unable to use the spell to conceal the appearance of another person. Similar to the wu jen variant, the spell was unable to any abilities or magical skills, and the caster was unable to duplicate language abilities or size. This variant was not restricted to the same species, a hishnashaper was able to disguise themselves as any species of the same size. If the hishnashaper encountered someone who was familiar with the target, such as a family member, there was a chance they could see through the ''disguise''.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s. 

For a wu jen, an item from the body of the subject, such as a hair, or an item that was constantly worn by the target had to be carried by the wu jen for  the duration of the spell. If the wu jen dropped or discarded the item, the spell expired immediately.

For a hishnashaper, the spell required the dried skin of a [[chameleon]].

==History==
Important and powerful individuals in Kara-Tur developed the habit of carefully disposing of cut hair or nail clippings to prevent their use with this spell.
