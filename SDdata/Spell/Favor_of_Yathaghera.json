        "mainbody": "'''''Favor of Yathaghera''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that gave wings to [[horse]]s and used by specialty priests devoted to [[Lurue]] called [[Silvermaid]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell caused an equine target, including a [[centaur]], to sprout the wings of a [[pegasus]] for several hours, allowing them to fly. The spell also made the spellcaster proficient with handling the flying mount for the duration of the spell but the target could only be ridden bareback. Any saddle placed upon the target would simply fall off. The steed behaved as if it were born with the wings.\n\nIf used on an equine target that already had wings, such as a pegasus, then the target's flying speed was doubled and their aerial maneuverability was enhanced.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a feather from a pegasus and the priestess's [[holy symbol]] to cast."
