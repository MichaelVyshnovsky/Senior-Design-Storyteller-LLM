        "mainbody": "'''''Burning blood''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that infused the target's blood with red-hot corrosive properties.",
        "Effects": "On casting the spell, for about a minute or two, the target suffered damage from their own blood being infused with a red-hot corrosive. Even if they managed to hold off the spell for a moment, that didn't guarantee the damage wouldn't return shortly after. It failed to work on [[construct]]s, [[plant]]s, [[undead]], [[elemental]]s, or [[ooze]]s.",
        "Components": "The spell called for [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s. The [[material component]]s were a pinch of [[saltpeter]] and a drop of blood.",
        "History": "The spell or one much like it was used by the [[gold dragon]] king [[Orchtrien]] against the [[elven]] [[wizard]] [[Rhespen Ash]] in their battle during the [[Time of Dragons]].{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|65}}"
