        "mainbody": "Burning blood was a necromancy spell that infused the targets blood with red-hot corrosive properties.\nOn casting the spell, for about a minute or two, the target suffered damage from their own blood being infused with a red-hot corrosive. Even if they managed to hold off the spell for a moment, that didnt guarantee the damage wouldnt return shortly after. It failed to work on constructs, plants, undead, elementals, or oozes.\nThe spell called for verbal and somatic components. The material components were a pinch of saltpeter and a drop of blood.\nThe spell or one much like it was used by the gold dragon king Orchtrien against the elven wizard Rhespen Ash in their battle during the Time of Dragons."
