        "mainbody": "'''''Pocket cave''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]]  that created an extra-dimensional space in the form of a cave, that was connected to the caster's current [[plane of existence]].",
        "Effects": "Extending into an existing rocky surface or earthen ground, a small, dark cave appeared. The entrance of was {{SI|4|ft}} wide and {{SI|8|ft}} tall, but opened into a larger expanse at least {{SI|90|cu ft}}. The cave was damp and dark, with a pool of fresh water and walls that were lined by edible fungus. It had enough breathable air for as many people and creatures the caster allowed within and was impregnable to everyone else. The entry to the cave sealed behind those who were granted admittance preventing unwanted entrance. External weather conditions or other natural happenings did not affect the cave's interior.\n\nThe ''pocket cave'' lasted for a number of hours depending on the skill and experience of the caster. Upon the end of the spell's duration anyone within were transported to the location of cave's entrance.",
        "Usage": "This spell was only available to initiates of the [[orc]] [[Orc pantheon|deity]] [[Gruumsh]].",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the use of a ''[[divine focus]]''."
