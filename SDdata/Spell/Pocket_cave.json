        "mainbody": "Pocket cave was a conjuration spell  that created an extra-dimensional space in the form of a cave, that was connected to the casters current plane of existence.\nExtending into an existing rocky surface or earthen ground, a small, dark cave appeared. The entrance of was  wide and  tall, but opened into a larger expanse at least . The cave was damp and dark, with a pool of fresh water and walls that were lined by edible fungus. It had enough breathable air for as many people and creatures the caster allowed within and was impregnable to everyone else. The entry to the cave sealed behind those who were granted admittance preventing unwanted entrance. External weather conditions or other natural happenings did not affect the caves interior.\nThe pocket cave lasted for a number of hours depending on the skill and experience of the caster. Upon the end of the spells duration anyone within were transported to the location of caves entrance.\nThis spell was only available to initiates of the orc deity Gruumsh.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of a divine focus."
