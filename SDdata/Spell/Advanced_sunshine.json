        "mainbody": "Advanced sunshine was an Amaunatori spell.\nAdvanced sunshine was an alteration spell that could be used for three purposes. All these effects were fueled by future sunlight or heat, dropping the temperature or duration of daylight for immediate effects.\nAs mentioned above, there were three effects that could be caused with advanced sunshine. First, one could create the equivalent of a very long-lasting light effect that cost minutes of daylight in return if cast during day or of the next day if cast at night. Second, one could create a fireball that dropped the temperature of an entire area  in radius by 1 °F (5/9 °C) for an entire tenday. This effect was unique for it was impossible to cast this spell at night. Third, the caster could create a very powerful continual light effect that shortened daylight by an entire hour on the day it was cast or of the next day if cast at night.\nAdvanced sunshine was cast with verbal and material components. The material component was the days sunshine.\nDue to the spells nature, the spell was reviled by farmers and ranchers who viewed as an abuse of the divine."
