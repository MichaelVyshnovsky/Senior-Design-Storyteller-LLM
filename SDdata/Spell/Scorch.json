It charred an item touched by the caster, often ruining it or making it useless.\nThe target of this spell had to be a non-living object of no more than  in weight,The original description of this cantrip in Dragon #100 gave a weight limit of  (100 gp equivalent) but this was reduced by a factor of ten in Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four. and had to be successfully touched by the caster. Scorch did not produce any heat, flame, smoke, or sound, it simply caused the target to char as if it had been seared by fire. If the object, such as an article of clothing, a scroll, or pages of a spellbook, did not resist the magic of this spell, it was typically destroyed or rendered useless.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster made a hissing sound as the object was touched.\nThis cantrip was one of three unique cantrips (along with horn and listen) recorded in Glanvyls Workbook, penned by the relatively unknown Glanvyl of Scornubel in the 11 century DR.The three cantrips described in Dragon #100 were replaced with the cantrip spell when the 2-edition Pages from the Mages was published. The Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four describes all the 1-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with cantrip."
