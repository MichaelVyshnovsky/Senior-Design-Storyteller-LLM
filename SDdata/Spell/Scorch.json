        "mainbody": "'''''Scorch''''' was a reversed [[cantrip]] that apprentice [[wizard]]s could learn. It charred an item touched by the caster, often ruining it or making it useless.",
        "Effects": "The target of this spell had to be a non-living object of no more than {{SI|1|lb|k|long=yes}} in weight,<ref group=\"note\">The original description of this cantrip in [[Dragon magazine 100|''Dragon'' #100]] gave a weight limit of {{SI|10|lb|k|long=yes}} (100 [[gp]] equivalent) but this was reduced by a factor of ten in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. and had to be successfully touched by the caster. ''Scorch'' did not produce any heat, flame, smoke, or sound, it simply caused the target to char as if it had been seared by fire. If the object, such as an article of clothing, a [[scroll]], or pages of a [[spellbook]], did not resist the magic of this spell, it was typically destroyed or rendered useless.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster made a hissing sound as the object was touched.",
        "History": "This cantrip was one of three unique cantrips (along with ''[[Horn (cantrip)|horn]]'' and ''[[listen]]'') recorded in ''[[Glanvyl's Workbook]]'', penned by the relatively unknown [[Glanvyl]] of [[Scornubel]] in the 11{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref group=\"note\">The three cantrips described in [[Dragon magazine 100|''Dragon'' #100]] were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''."
