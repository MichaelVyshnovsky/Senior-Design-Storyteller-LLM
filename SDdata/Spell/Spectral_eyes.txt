Spectral eyes was an uncommon spell used by necromancers.
A caster used this spell to see through the eyes of either a skeleton or a zombie. The creature had to be within  of the caster for the spell to function properly. This distance increased as the casters skill level increased. Additionally, the spell allowed the caster to command the creature, providing limited movement. If the targeted creature was already under the command of another caster, this aspect of the spell failed. If the creature wandered out of the area of effect, the visual link was severed and the spell ended.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a preserved eye.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
