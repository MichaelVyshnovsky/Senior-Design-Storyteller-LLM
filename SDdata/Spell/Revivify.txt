'''''Revivify''''' was a [[conjuration]] or [[necromancy]] spell that restored life to a creature that had died very recently.

==Effects==
This spelled allowed a recently-deceased being to regain their life, albeit in a weakened and near-death state. In order for ''revivify'' to take effect during the [[Era of Upheaval]], the spell had to be cast within a matter of seconds after the moment of death.

==Components==
In all versions of this spell, it required verbal, somatic, and material components. The somatic component was to touch the creature, while the material component was [[diamond]]s. For the conjuration spell, the diamonds had to equal 1,000 [[gp]]. For the necromancy spell, the diamonds only needed to equal 300 [[gp]].

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], as an effect of the [[death curse]] brought upon [[Toril]] by the [[lich]] [[Acererak]] via the [[Soulmonger]], any spell that restored a creature's spirit to its body, including ''revivify'', automatically failed, as all deceased creatures' souls remained imprisoned within the artifact.
