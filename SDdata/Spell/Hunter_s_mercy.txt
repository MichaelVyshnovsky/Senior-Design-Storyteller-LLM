Hunters mercy was a transmutation spell granted uniquely to rangers by their deities.
After a prayer for mercy, a rangers next shot with a bow, if taken quickly, would not miss and had a good chance of inflicting critical damage to its target.
To cast this spell required verbal and somatic components.
