Dispel law was an abjuration spell that worked exactly like dispel evil except it affected lawful spells and creatures instead of evil ones.
The effects of this spell were the same as dispel evil except the aura surrounding the spellcaster was yellow, flickered like a candle, and made of chaotic energy.
Verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell plus the casters (un)holy symbol or divine focus.
