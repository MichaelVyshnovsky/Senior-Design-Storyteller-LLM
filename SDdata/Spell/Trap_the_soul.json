        "mainbody": "Trap the soul was a sorcerer and wizard conjuration spell, considered by some to be evil, that allowed the caster to trap the life force and material body (if any) of a creature inside a gem.\nThe caster could complete the spell normally, by speaking the final word of the spell once the target was in range and if speaking their name they would bypass any magic resistances the creature might have. Alternatively, the caster could create a trigger object that would entrap the creature within their gem upon being touched. Some casters would try to ensure this outcome by casting sympathy upon the trigger object. Creating a trigger object required the spells final word and the creatures name, or in older versions its true name, to be inscribed upon the trigger object as the gem was being enspelled. This inscription of their name similarly bypassed any magic resistances the creature might possess.\nThis spell had a permanent duration, holding creatures captured by it indefinitely. They could only be released by breaking their gem, upon which their body would materialize. If the creature was a powerful outsider, then upon being freed from their imprisonment they might be required to perform a service for the one who freed them, otherwise they were left to go free. For this reason, some casters would pair the spells usage with spells that summoned powerful outsiders, such as cacofiend.\nIf the gem being used by a caster was not of a high enough value compared to the power of the creature, the gem would shatter instead of functioning properly. And if trap the soul were to be cast upon a devourer, it would affect the spirit trapped within the fiend instead of the creature itself.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component in the form of a gem worth at least 1,000 gold pieces. The more powerful the creature being trapped, the more valuable the gem had to be. The value necessary to trap the desired creature was something casters could research, though this necessary value could change over time.\nOlder versions of the spell required that the caster enchant their gem by means of the enchant an item and maze spells.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Dethed in  and was originally known as Detheds trap.\nSome of the inhabitants of Esh Alakar in Maztica were trapped in gems beneath the ruins of the site, after falling victim to this spell.\n* This spell was typically known by liches and those attempting to achieve lichdom, as it was a necessary component in the creation of a phylactery.\n* Brachina, a type of baatezu, could innately cast this spell once per day.\n* Chardath Spulzeer, a wizard who was bestowed trap the soul alongside many other spells by means of a genie wish granted by the djinni Gentar.\n* Cyndre, a Thayan wizard.\n* Eles Wianar, the ruler of Chondath in the 14 century DR.\n* The demon lord Grazzt could innately cast this spell once per day.\n* Kazit Gul, the demilich master of the Doomvault of Thay.\n* Maddgoth, a serial killer of wizards.\n* Manshoon, founder of the Zhentarim.\n* The molydei, a powerful form of tanarri, could innately cast this spell once per day and for its use they kept large valuable rubies inset within the greataxes they wielded.\n* Nevron, a Thayan wizard and the Zulkir of Conjuration.\n* Sammaster, the founder of the Cult of the Dragon, knew how to cast this spell as far back as the 9 century DR when he was a Chosen of Mystra.\n* Shoon VII, a terribly wicked ruler and powerful demilich, who inscribed the spell within his spellbook the Tome of the Unicorn.\n* Slarkrethel, the kraken leader of the Kraken Society.\n* Sumulael, a powerful Zakharan necromancer.\n* Szass Tam, the Zulkir of Necromancy and lich ruler of Thay.\n* Thurndan Tallwand, one of the most powerful wizards in Mulmaster. He notably used this spell to entrap Mulmasters ruler Selfaril Uoumdolphin within a gem in the pommel of the mans sword, at the request of his usurping brother Rassendyll Uoumdolphin."
