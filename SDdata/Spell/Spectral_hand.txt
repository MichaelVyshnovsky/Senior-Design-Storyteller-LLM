Spectral hand was an arcane necromancy spell that summoned a ghostly appendage to do the casters bidding.
This spell used a bit of the casters life force to create a ghostly hand to behave as the caster desired. The spectral hand could be used to deliver touch spells with a greater chance of contacting the target. The caster would feel any damage caused to the hand which would also end the spell.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
Necrophants of Velsharoon could cast this spell once per day.
