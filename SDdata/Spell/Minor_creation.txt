Minor creation was a common spell used by sorcerers, wizards, and wu jen.
A caster used this spell to create material or an item. The item was required to be plant-based, such as rope or wood. The spell could be used to create simple clothing, if the fibers were plant-based. The effects of the spell were temporary, and the amount of material created depended on the casters skill level.
The effects of minor creation could be replicated by the divine spell chain creation.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a piece of the material that was to be created.
The spell was invented in  by Netherese arcanist Lefeber.
