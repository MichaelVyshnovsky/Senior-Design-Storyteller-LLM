        "mainbody": "Archers redoubt was a spell used by clerics of Solonor Thelandira.\nWhen cast, an invisible shield surrounded the caster. Within the shield is an arrowslit, allowing the caster to safely fire arrows at will. The caster could mentally reposition the arrowslit. Once cast, the shield could not be moved until the spell expired or the caster walked through the barrier.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, the holy symbol of Solonor Thelandira."
