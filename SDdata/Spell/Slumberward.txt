Slumberward was a very rare spell.
When cast, the spell protected the caster or a targeted creature from sleepiness, tiredness, and similar conditions brought on by a spell or magical condition, including charms and enchantments. It offered some protection from willpower-based spells such as command and suggestion. The spell did not protect against the effects of drugs or poisons. It also did not protect from being stunned and did not prevent unconsciousness from a physical strike.
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
Slumberward was one of the spells within Galadasters Orizon.
