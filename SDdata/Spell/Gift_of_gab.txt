Gift of gab was an enchantment spell that altered the short-term memories of nearby people, making them forget that something was said.
The spell affected listeners within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the caster. It erased their memories of everything they heard from the caster within the previous 6 seconds and replaced it with a new memory of the casters choice.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and royalty components of 2 gp. The spells verbal component became the listeners new memory of what was said.
The spell was credited to the wizard Jim Darkmagic, who originally called it I said what‚Åà.
