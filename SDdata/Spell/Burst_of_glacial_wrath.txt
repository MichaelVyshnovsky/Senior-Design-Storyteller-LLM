Burst of glacial wrath was a devastating evocation spell that immediately turned its targets to solid ice. The spell was granted to druids by their patron deities and could be weaved by sorcerers and mages.
When the spell was uttered, it unleashed a  burst of blue magical energy â€“ a bubble of freezing cold that grew as it moved forward, forming a cone of the affected area. The sheer power of this burst of energy was such that everything it touched was instantly frozen to the bone, dealing devastating cold damage. All creatures that received enough harm to be killed were flash-frozen instead. This freezing magic, akin to the flesh to stone spell, transformed its victims into statues of ice, a state from which only the most powerful spells like miracle, true resurrection, or wish could bring them back to life.
Additionally, every spellcaster who learned this spell received a permanent resistance to mundane and magical cold in addition to whatever resistance to cold they already possessed, cumulatively.
The spell required only a somatic and verbal components.
