'''''Gull''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to priests of [[Baravar Cloakshadow]], the Sly One. It made a target creature gullible, so they were easily fooled by an assertion made by the caster, as long as it was not blatantly false.

==Effects==
This spell worked on one target creature within {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} and lasted for three minutes (longer for more experienced casters). The target of ''gull'' had one chance to resist the spell and, if successful, was completely unaffected. Otherwise, they were convinced that a single statement, assertion, or excuse given by the caster was the truth. The lie had to be plausible and not contradicted by obvious evidence that was apparent to the target.

For example, a [[gnome]] [[hoodwinker]] ([[specialty priest]] of Baravar Cloakshadow) could convince a guard that they forgot the password but would be unsuccessful trying to convince a guard that they were an [[elf]] in disguise, due to their stature.

==Components==
This spell required a [[verbal component]], a pinch of sugar as the [[material component]], and use of the priest's [[holy symbol]].
