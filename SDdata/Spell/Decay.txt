Decay was a divine alteration spell that was granted to specialty priests of Bhaal, up until the Time of Troubles. While it had no effect on living beings, it would accelerate the aging of any item it was cast upon.
The spell would deteriorate an item at the rate of one day for every hour of existence after its casting. Any minor damage, such as tears, dents or strains in its integrity would worsen twenty-fold. Eventually an object affected by decay would crack, break, corrode or outright disintegrate into dust. Magical items had a natural inherent resistance to this effect and artifacts and relics had complete immunity.
The spell dispel magic could slow the effects of this spell.
Verbal, somatic and material components were required in the casting of this spell. The material component was the castersholy symbol.
