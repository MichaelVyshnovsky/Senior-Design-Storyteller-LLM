'''''Fire breath''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur. 

==Effects==
The spell enabled a wu jen to breathe a very large cone of magical flame. This cone was 30 feet (9 meters) long and 15 feet (4.5 meters) wide at the base. The powerful flame would instantly ignite any combustible material within the cone.

If a wu jen cast this spell in the [[phlogiston]], the wu jen and anyone within a 60 foot (18 meter) by 30 foot (9 meter) area were injured by the magical flame.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]. The wu jen clenched a piece of hot charcoal with their teeth during casting.
