Multiple message mote was an improved version of the spell message mote.
This spell created a message mote, as per the spell of the same name, with two significant improvements. First, the mote could be re-activated every time the casters specifications were met. Second, the mote could utter a second, shorter message that would only be released in the presence of a Tyrran clergy member.
Multiple message mote had both a verbal and somatic component.
Along with message mote, this spell appeared on one of the scrolls found within the Balance of Belaros.
