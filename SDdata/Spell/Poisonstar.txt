'''''Poisonstar''''' was a [[spell]] that was commonly used by [[alhoon]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, nine small purple stars appeared around the caster's hand. The stars were pitch black in the middle and random sparks shot from them. The caster was able to target nine separate creatures. When struck, a targeted creature was poisoned and suffered corrosive damage. The spell was particularly effective against [[undead]] creatures. Creatures made from inorganic material were immune to the effects of this spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required several [[material component]]s, a drop of poison and saliva from the caster, and a small flame or spark. During casting the flame was extinguished.
