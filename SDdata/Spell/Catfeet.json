        "mainbody": "Catfeet was a personal cantrip that initiate wizards could learn. It silenced the footfalls of the caster and ensured agile landings for a few minutes.\nThis cantrip only worked on the casters feetâ€”it could not be bestowed on anyone else. For a maximum of five minutes,The original description of this cantrip in Dragon #100 allowed longer durations for high-level casters. the tread of the casters feet made no noise while traversing most surfaces. However, objects knocked over, broken, or dislodged, or traps triggered by the movement of the casters feet were not silenced, nor were other sounds made by things other than the feet (a staff tapping the ground, or the swish of a robe, for example).\nIn addition, the caster was guaranteed to land on their feet, keep their balance, and not have the wind knocked out of them, if they fell or jumped down a distance of up to .The original description said \"a fall of any height\" but this was altered in the Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four. A reduction in the chance to slip on greasy or damp surfaces was also removed. Any damage the caster might take from such a drop was slightly reduced by this cantrip while it was in effect.\nCatfeet could be used with other spells, such as spider climb, without detriment or interference.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast.Again, the original description only mentioned the somatic component. The caster made a soft purring noise by vibrating their tongue against the roof of their mouth while making a stroking gesture with the fingers on one hand.\nThis cantrip was invented by Sabirine, a cantrip enthusiast who created and improved many such spells in her career. Catfeet was recorded in her tome known as Sabirines Specular."
