'''''Spectral claw''''' was an [[arcane magic]] spell used by [[sorcerer]]s to create a claw of force that could immobilize and harm an opponent.

==Effects==
This spell brought forth a claw made of pure force, similar to the various ''[[Bigby's hand]]'' spells, and could be described as a combination of ''[[Bigby's grasping hand]]'' and ''[[Bigby's crushing hand]]''. ''Spectral claw'' could grab a creature and hold it immobile, doing damage to its target on a successful grab. Sorcerers who tapped into the [[Elemental Chaos]] for their power had a chance to push their target similar to ''[[Bigby's forceful hand]]''.

This spell required a few minutes rest in between castings.
