Spectral claw was an arcane magic spell used by sorcerers to create a claw of force that could immobilize and harm an opponent.
This spell brought forth a claw made of pure force, similar to the various Bigbys hand spells, and could be described as a combination of Bigbys grasping hand and Bigbys crushing hand. Spectral claw could grab a creature and hold it immobile, doing damage to its target on a successful grab. Sorcerers who tapped into the Elemental Chaos for their power had a chance to push their target similar to Bigbys forceful hand.
This spell required a few minutes rest in between castings.
