        "mainbody": "he Adder Swamp, sometimes spelled Adderswamp, was a dangerous expanse of lycanthrope-infested marshland that surrounded the Adder River delta in Chessenta.\nThe swamp was murky and infested with insects and vermin.\nFollowing the Spellplague and the various catastrophes that befell Chessenta, the Adder Swamp greatly expanded to cover much of the western coast of the Bay of Chessenta.\nThe swamp was home to both werecrocodiles and wererats, which were in frequent conflict with each other.\nThe native werecrocodiles had a half-sunken city on the seaward edge of the swamp By the late 15 century DR, the werecrocodiles domain had expanded throughout the swamp as the nation of Sebakar.\nThe chaotic halfling barony of Ursuma was founded within the swamp sometime before 1372 DR.\nLike the Adder River, the Adder Swamp was also known for its large snake population. It was also one of the few rare places along the entire coast of Chessenta where sailors would not moor their boats."
