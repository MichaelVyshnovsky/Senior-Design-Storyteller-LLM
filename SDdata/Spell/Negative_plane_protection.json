        "mainbody": "Negative plane protection was an abjuration (if divine) spell that gave the recipient one chance to completely avoid the draining effects of a negative energy attack. This spell could not be cast on the Negative Energy plane.\nThe caster had to touch the recipient in order to cast this spell. The duration of this spell lasted for minutes to a couple hours or until the target was hit by an attack form using negative energy. The divine version of this spell opened a channel to the Positive Energy plane\nCreatures that partially existed on the plane, including shadows, wights, wraiths, spectres and vampires, could damage the target of the spell normally.\nThe arcane version of this spell was developed by the tiefling Grand Vizar of Calimshan, known as Shangalar the Black before he achieved lichdom. It was originally described in his personal spellbook.\nVerbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. The arcane version also required three drops of blood from the caster as a material component.\nThis spell was inscribed within the Kelemvorite relic the Testament of Vraer."
