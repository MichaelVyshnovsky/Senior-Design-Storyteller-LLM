'''''Blood ring''''' was a spell unique to [[the Simbul]].

==Effect==
The spell brought to [[the Simbul]]'s aid any creatures of her choice that had some of her blood encysted anywhere inside their body, normally from battling the Simbul: she had sent some of it herself into their wounds during the struggle. The creatures were commandable by her, and neither perceived her nor each other.

==History==
The Simbul employed that spell when fighting the legions of [[Hell]] in {{yearlink|1372}}, bringing all her deadliest enemies forth to strike at the devils. The foes she summoned included one [[beholder]], two human mages, [[Ravaedrin]] of the [[Zhentarim]] and [[Kaladras Yarlamm]] of the [[Red Wizards]], and a [[dragon]]. All but the dragon and Ravaedrin were slain ere she dismissed the spell and returned from Hell. She expected to spend centuries rebuilding the spell, implying those were the only creatures she'd failed to slay, though it had taken her decades to create in the first place.
