        "mainbody": "'''''Sleep of dragons''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Tiamat]] called [[Wyrmkeeper]]s.",
        "Effects": "The target of this spell fell into a deep sleep similar to that of a hibernating [[dragon]] after being touched by the caster. While in dragon sleep, the target did not require air, food or water and only aged one year for a century of sleep. The dragon sleep ended when the target was killed, died of old age, or was touched by a fragment of dragon bone. Spells such as ''[[dispel magic]]'' and ''[[remove curse]]'' did not affect ''sleep of dragons''. Furthermore, resistances and immunties to common ''[[sleep]]'' spells provided no defense against this spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a thimble of dragon blood to cast."
