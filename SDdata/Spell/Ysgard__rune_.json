        "mainbody": "Ysgard was a type of giant rune and was considered one of the most powerful.\nOnce activated, this rune was said to create in place of a doorway a temporary portal between Toril and Annam All-Fathers crystal palace Gudheim in Jotunheim. Once closed, this portal could not be re-opened from the Outer Planes.\nThe number of minutes for which this portal remained open was equivalent to the level of the runecaster that activated it.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune Annams unblinking eye. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to six weeks and it needed to be inscribed upon a closed doorway."
