        "mainbody": "Sanctuary was a type of giant rune that created a barrier in doorways and portals. It was considered to be the reverse of the imprisonment rune.\nOnce activated, this rune made it impossible for creatures to enter through its inscribed door or portal by mundane. However, creatures could still exit these barriers and they could be bypassed by translocation spells, such as teleport and dimension door. The runes effect lasted for a duration of days equal to that of the casters level.\nUnlike the imprisonment rune, there was no associated \"freedom word\" function for prematurely deactivating a sanctuary runes barrier.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune triumph. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to eight days and it needed to be inscribed upon a door or portal."
