'''''Cat charm''''' was a spell unique to [[Maztica]].

==Effects==
This spell allowed a caster to detect the presence of any non-magical feline such as a [[jaguar]]. The spell did not summon a feline to the caster, the targeted feline had to be within sight and within at least 20 yards (18 meters) of the caster. Once successfully cast, the charmed feline was able to understand rudimentary commands and perform simple tasks. Tasks often included guarding the caster or attacking an enemy. The caster was also able to tie a message around the feline's neck and have them deliver a message. The further away the feline traveled from the caster, the greater the chance the spell would be broken. The enchantment lasted at least a week. 

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[material component]]s.
