'''''Burning blood''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] used by [[dragons]]. It struck back at attackers with blood suffused by the caster's [[dragon breath|breath weapon]].

==Effects==
This spell had no effect unless the caster had a breath weapon that dealt damage based on fire, cold, electricity, or acid. Once cast, every time the user was wounded, their blood would splash out from the wound, carrying with it the power of their breath weapon against any creatures within {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}}. Though the damage was not comparable with that of similar spells, it continued to increase with the user's skill, and endured for many hours.

==Components==
The spell called for [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
