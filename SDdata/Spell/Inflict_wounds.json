        "mainbody": "Inflict light wounds, also known as cause light wounds, was a necromancy spell that caused light damage to a creature touched by the caster. After the Second Sundering it was simply called inflict wounds.\nWhen this spell was cast, with a touch, the caster channeled negative energy that did harm to living beings. Conversely, because negative energy powered undead, it healed them to the same degree instead.\nThe reverse of this spell, cure light wounds, channeled positive energy and had the exact opposite effect (healed the living, harmed the undead).\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components."
