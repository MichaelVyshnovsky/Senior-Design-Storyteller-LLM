        "mainbody": "'''''Vocalize''''' was an [[alteration]] spell that allowed a spell-caster to cast spells without uttering a sound.",
        "Effects": "For five minutes, this spell granted the ability to cast spells silently. The caster of ''vocalize'' had to touch the recipient to confer this ability on someone else. For the duration of ''vocalize'', the spell-casting creature did not need to speak as part of casting a spell, as long as the casting was finished within the five minute time limit of ''vocalize''. Thus, the recipient could cast spells within the bounds of a ''[[silence]]'' spell, or when stealth was important, for example. Somatic and material components are not affected by ''vocalize'', only the verbal requirement is deleted from the spell(s) being cast.",
        "Components": "No verbal component was necessary to cast this spell, only somatic and a material component in the form of a bell with no clapper."
