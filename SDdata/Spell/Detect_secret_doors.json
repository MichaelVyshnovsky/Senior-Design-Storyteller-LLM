        "Effect": "When cast, this spell allows the caster to detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and so forth. Only passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically constructed to escape detection are detected by this spell - an ordinary trapdoor underneath a pile of creates will not be detected.\n\nThe amount of information revealed by this spell depends on how long the caster studies a particular area or object. Upon casting the spell, the caster becomes aware of the presence or absence of secret doors. Slowly, the spell reveals the number of secret doors and the location of each. If an aura is outside the caster's line of sight, then they can discern its direction but not its exact location. If the caster continues to take in the area, the spell begins to reveal mechanisms or triggers for one particular secret portal when closely examined by the caster.\n\nThe spell can penetrate barriers, but a foot of stone, an inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or three feet of wood or dirt blocks it."
