Flash was an evocation spell that allowed the caster to create a blinding flash of light that hampered the eyesight of anyone caught within the blast.
The partial blindness caused by flash lasted for anywhere from a matter of seconds to a couple minutes. Those that resisted the spells effects recovered in a shorter amount of time.
