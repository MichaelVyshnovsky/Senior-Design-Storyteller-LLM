        "mainbody": "Touch of fatigue was a necromancy spell that instilled fatigue in the target.\nOn casting touch of fatigue, the caster gained the ability to channel negative energy with a touch. On touching the target, this negative energy was channeled through the target and the target became fatigued. This fatigue was purely sustained by magic and therefore ended with the spell.\nTouch of fatigue required somatic, verbal, and material components. The needed material component was a drop of sweat."
