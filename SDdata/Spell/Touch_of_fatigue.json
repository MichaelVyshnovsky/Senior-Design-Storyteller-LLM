        "mainbody": "'''''Touch of fatigue''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that instilled fatigue in the target.",
        "Effects": "On casting ''touch of fatigue'', the caster gained the ability to channel [[negative energy]] with a touch. On touching the target, this negative energy was channeled through the target and the target became fatigued. This fatigue was purely sustained by [[magic]] and therefore ended with the spell.",
        "Components": "''Touch of fatigue'' required somatic, verbal, and material components. The needed material component was a drop of sweat."
