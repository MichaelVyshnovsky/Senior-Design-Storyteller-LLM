        "mainbody": "'''''Wandering glyphs''''' was a multi-[[magic|school]] [[divine magic|divine]] [[spell]] that created two ''glyphs'' that could be consciously moved, or would randomly wander, along a pre-determined set of surfaces.",
        "Effects": "The ''glyphs'' created by this spell had the same properties and powers as those conjured by the spell ''[[glyph of warding]]'', the major difference being these were capable of movement.",
        "Casting": "While casting ''wandering glyphs'', the [[priest]] would outline between two to six different surfaces with incense, and hence designate them as able to be traveled across. They all had to be within a one-mile radius of one another. When the casting was finished, and the caster created their ''glyphs'' they would be capable of travel along these surface types, taking either a path set by the caster, or completely random pathways.",
        "Components": "This spell required the material components of incense, a drop of [[holy water|holy/unholy water]] for every selected surface, a [[black opal]] worth more than 250 [[gp]] and, if the surface area protected was greater than 50 square feet, powdered [[diamond]] with a minimum value of 1000 gp."
