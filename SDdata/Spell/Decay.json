        "mainbody": "'''''Decay''''' was a [[divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that was granted to [[specialty priest]]s of [[Bhaal]], up until the [[Time of Troubles]]. While it had no effect on living beings, it would accelerate the aging of any item it was cast upon.",
        "Effect": "The spell would deteriorate an item at the rate of one day for every hour of existence after its casting. Any minor damage, such as tears, dents or strains in its integrity would worsen twenty-fold. Eventually an object affected by ''decay'' would crack, break, corrode or outright disintegrate into dust. [[Magic]]al items had a natural inherent resistance to this effect and [[artifact]]s and [[relic]]s had complete immunity.\n\nThe spell ''[[dispel magic]]'' could slow the effects of this spell.",
        "Components": "[[Verbal component|Verbal]], [[somatic component|somatic]] and [[material component]]s were required in the casting of this spell. The material component was the caster's''[[holy symbol]]''."
