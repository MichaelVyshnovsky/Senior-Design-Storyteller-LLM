        "mainbody": "Earthenair was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Grumbar, enabling them to cause an eruption of earth around a target.\nThis spell caused a small but violent explosion of earth to erupt beneath a target, pummeling them with rocks and debris that caused harm and interrupted their actions. This spell would not work if the target was standing upon a stone surface unless the caster was particularly powerful.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a handful of pebbles and the priests holy symbol to cast. The pebbles were tossed at the target during casting."
