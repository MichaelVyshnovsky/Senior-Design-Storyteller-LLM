        "mainbody": "'''''Earthenair''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Grumbar]], enabling them to cause an eruption of earth around a target.",
        "Effects": "This spell caused a small but violent explosion of earth to erupt beneath a target, pummeling them with rocks and debris that caused harm and interrupted their actions. This spell would not work if the target was standing upon a stone surface unless the caster was particularly powerful.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a handful of pebbles and the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast. The pebbles were tossed at the target during casting."
