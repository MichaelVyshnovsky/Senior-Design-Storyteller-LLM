'''''Avoid planar effects''''' was a spell of the [[abjuration]] It was primarily used to provide spellcasters enough time for them to cast stronger and longer-lasting protective spells.

==Effects==
This spell was rather limited to providing temporary relief from or immunity to the natural effects of a plane. This included, but was not limited to, such things as a lack of air, [[poison]]ous fumes, temperature extremes, or emanations of [[negative energy|negative]] or [[positive energy]]. For example, it could provide some protection against flames on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], allow one to breath within the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]], guard against blinding in positive-dominant planes, or guard their life energy in negative-dominant planes. In addition, some plane-specific effects were negated by this spell, such as the freezing cold of [[Cania]] and the [[Para-elemental Plane of Ice]], or the deafening effects of [[Pandemonium]].

''Avoid planar effects'' would not provide those affected protection against creatures (native or otherwise), magical [[spell]]s, and [[trap]]s. It also provided no protection against the [[alignment]], gravity, and magic traits of each plane of existence, as well as any alterations or restrictions to spells that were imposed by planes and planar pathways. And it provided no protection against the "entrapping" effect that some planes had, like [[Elysium]] and [[Hades]].

Lastly, the spell would not provide protection against extreme and nonnatural formations. This included such things as magma

This spell lasted for a standard duration of one minute, amplified by the spellcaster's skill. Older versions of the spell could only be cast on a single target, while later versions could effect multiple creatures within a {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} of the spellcaster depending upon their arcane skills.

==Components==
This spell required only a [[verbal component]] to cast.

==History==
Sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Gheldoin]], a [[duergar]] sage living in the plane of [[Acheron]], gifted a [[spellbook]] containing ''avoid planar effect'' to a group of [[Ravenian]] [[adventurer]]s after they impressed him by deciphering the script on an old [[scroll]] that detailed a story about the duergar [[god]] [[Laduguer]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Stone and Steel|15,17}}
