'''''Two-D'lusion''''' was a minor [[illusion]] [[cantrip]] that acolyte [[illusionist]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It was a very limited version of ''[[phantasmal force]]'' in most respects and created a flat scene of anything the caster could imagine and describe.

==Effects==
This cantrip had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} The cantrip was dispelled if it was touched by anyone other than the caster. It could also be canceled by ''[[dispel illusion]]'' or ''[[dispel magic]]''. In addition, if the flat image was viewed from an angle more than 45&deg; away from the perpendicular axis, its nature was completely obvious. The illusion was invisible from the back and sides.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster moved a closed hand in a circle while speaking a phrase that described the desired effect.
