        "mainbody": "Gift of gab was an enchantment spell that altered the short-term memories of nearby people, making them forget that something was said.\nThe spell affected listeners within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the caster. It erased their memories of everything they heard from the caster within the previous 6 seconds and replaced it with a new memory of the casters choice.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and royalty components of 2 gp. The spells verbal component became the listeners new memory of what was said.\nThe spell was credited to the wizard Jim Darkmagic, who originally called it I said what‚Åà."
