'''''Bloodburn''''', also known as '''''bloodboil''''', was a [[spell]] that could only be cast by [[dragon]]s.

==Effects==
This was a truly terrible spell cast by only the most evil dragons. [[Red dragon]]s were the most common users of this spell. When cast, the liquid within a creature or a plant instantaneously became hot enough to reach the boiling point. Creatures such as slimes and oozes instantly dissolved. This spell had no effect on [[undead]] creatures or creatures with an immunity to fire or heat. The only defense against the spell was ''[[dispel magic]]'' or a cold-based spell. 

==Casting==
This spell required only a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component.
