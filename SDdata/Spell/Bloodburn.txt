Bloodburn, also known as bloodboil, was a spell that could only be cast by dragons.
This was a truly terrible spell cast by only the most evil dragons. Red dragons were the most common users of this spell. When cast, the liquid within a creature or a plant instantaneously became hot enough to reach the boiling point. Creatures such as slimes and oozes instantly dissolved. This spell had no effect on undead creatures or creatures with an immunity to fire or heat. The only defense against the spell was dispel magic or a cold-based spell. 
This spell required only a verbal component.
