        "mainbody": "Named for leonal guardinals, leonals roar was an evocation spell for druids that injured, debilitated, and even slew creatures that were not good.\nTo non-good beings within 40 feet (12 meters) who lacked the fortitude to resist, leonals roar harmed them and inflicted a holy word, which could daze, weaken, paralyze, or even slay them.\nIt required only a verbal component."
