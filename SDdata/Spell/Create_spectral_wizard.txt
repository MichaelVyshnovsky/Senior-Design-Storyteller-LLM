'''''Create spectral wizard''''' was an unusual [[necromancy|necromantic]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s. This spell was found in ''[[Kyristan's Mysteries]]'' and was developed by the [[lich]] [[Kyristan]].

==Effects==
This vile spell was used to turn spellcasters into [[undead]] [[spectral wizard]]s. It only worked against [[human]]s, [[elves]], and [[gnome]]s. If used against an unwilling target there was a chance the target would be able to resist the spell's magic, negating the spell.

Any spellcaster succumbing to the spell's magic, either willingly or unwillingly, would be killed and transformed into an unique undead spellcaster. The shock of dying caused these spectral wizards to lose some of their expertise. Spectral wizards were free-willed, but any words from the original caster of the ''create spectral wizard'' spell that turned them acted like a powerful ''[[suggestion]]'', forcing the undead wizard to obey the caster's commands.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a target wizard to cast.
