'''''Charm lycanthrope''''' was a [[sorcerer]]/[[wizard]] spell that could be used to charm natural [[lycanthropes]], although it would not work with infected lycanthropes.

In order to cast the spell, the caster had to use the blood of a natural lycanthrope as the material component. This spell did not end if the lycanthrope changed form.

This spell was developed by [[Avan Vatsisen]] and he was likely the only one who is able to use it.
