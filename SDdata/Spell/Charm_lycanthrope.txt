Charm lycanthrope was a sorcerer/wizard spell that could be used to charm natural lycanthropes, although it would not work with infected lycanthropes.
In order to cast the spell, the caster had to use the blood of a natural lycanthrope as the material component. This spell did not end if the lycanthrope changed form.
This spell was developed by Avan Vatsisen and he was likely the only one who is able to use it.
