        "mainbody": "Fire of justice was a necromancy spell that ignited a magical fire within the body of any creature struck by the caster. It was used by clerics of the Faer√ªnian god of justice, Tyr.\nWhen in battle, a cleric could cast fire of justice at any person or creature they had previously harmed. When cast, it produced a fire-like energy within the targets body that \"burned\" them from the inside out. It was particularly damaging to the undead.\nThis spell appeared on one of the scrolls that was stored within the Balance of Belaros.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a piece of coal that had been previously been set alight and a drop of holy water that had been consecrated by a Tyrran cleric."
