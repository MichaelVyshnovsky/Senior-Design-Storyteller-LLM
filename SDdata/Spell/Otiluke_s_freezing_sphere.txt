'''''Otiluke's freezing sphere''''' ({{Pronounce|O|ti|look|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|28}}}}) was an [[evocation]] spell that inflicted cold injuries and froze water. It was presumably developed by [[Otiluke]].

To [[Zakhara]]n mages, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''freezing sphere''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Sea (province)|province of sea]].

==Effects==
''Otiluke's freezing sphere'' was a potent and versatile spell. Casters possessed the option to manifest a variety of effects with the spell.

* Frigid globe: This effect produced a compact sphere comprised of matter at absolute zero. Upon interacting with water or a predominantly water-based liquid, this sphere swiftly expanded, freezing the liquid to a depth of {{SI|6|in|c|long=yes}} over an expanse measuring {{SI|100|sq ft|long=yes}}. The area affected and the duration of the ice was determined by the caster's skill level.

* Cold ray: This effect emitted a slender beam of intense cold that emanated from the caster's outstretched hand. This frigid ray extended to a minimum distance of {{SI|10|yd|long=yes}}. The distance of the beam and the damage inflicted by it was determined by the caster's skill level.

* Globe of cold: This effect materialized a diminutive sphere resembling a sling stone. Though it emanated a cooling sensation, it lacked inherent harm. This sphere was ideal as short range ammunition, reaching distances of up to {{SI|40|yd|long=yes}}. It could be thrown by hand or used as ammunition within a [[sling]]. Upon impact, the sphere fractured, releasing energy that inflicted cold-based damage upon any creatures within a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} radius.

==Components==
In addition to a [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] component, each effect has a unique [[material component]]. The frigid globe effect required a small sheet of thin crystal, roughly {{SI|1|sq in|long=yes}} in size. The cold ray effect required a piece of white [[sapphire]] with a value of at least 1,000 [[gp]]. And the globe of cold effect required a [[diamond]] with a value of at least 1,000 [[gp]].
