Otilukes freezing sphere () was an evocation spell that inflicted cold injuries and froze water. It was presumably developed by Otiluke.
To Zakharan mages, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as freezing sphere, and counted among the spells of the province of sea.
Otilukes freezing sphere was a potent and versatile spell. Casters possessed the option to manifest a variety of effects with the spell.
* Frigid globe This effect produced a compact sphere comprised of matter at absolute zero. Upon interacting with water or a predominantly water-based liquid, this sphere swiftly expanded, freezing the liquid to a depth of  over an expanse measuring . The area affected and the duration of the ice was determined by the casters skill level.
* Cold ray This effect emitted a slender beam of intense cold that emanated from the casters outstretched hand. This frigid ray extended to a minimum distance of . The distance of the beam and the damage inflicted by it was determined by the casters skill level.
* Globe of cold This effect materialized a diminutive sphere resembling a sling stone. Though it emanated a cooling sensation, it lacked inherent harm. This sphere was ideal as short range ammunition, reaching distances of up to . It could be thrown by hand or used as ammunition within a sling. Upon impact, the sphere fractured, releasing energy that inflicted cold-based damage upon any creatures within a  radius.
In addition to a verbal and somatic component, each effect has a unique material component. The frigid globe effect required a small sheet of thin crystal, roughly  in size. The cold ray effect required a piece of white sapphire with a value of at least 1,000 gp. And the globe of cold effect required a diamond with a value of at least 1,000 gp.
