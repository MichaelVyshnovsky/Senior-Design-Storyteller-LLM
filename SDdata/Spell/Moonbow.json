        "mainbody": "Moonbow was a spell used by clerics of Sehanine Moonbow.\nWhen cast, this spell created a crystalline bow with a bowstring of silver light. Depending on the casters needs, the bow was the same size and strength of a shortbow or a longbow. Only the caster was capable of using the bow.\nWhen drawn, a magical silver arrow appeared in the bow, and on release, the arrow was trailed by motes of moonlight. The effect of the arrow depended on the target. Against a living creature, the arrow delivered a bolt of energy from the Positive Material Plane. Against undead targets who drew their energy from the Negative Material Plane, also creatures from said plane, the arrow delivered terrible damage and covered the target in silver faerie fire. When fired at an undead creature who drew its power from the Positive Material plane, and any creature from said plane, it cured the target.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Sehanine Moonbow and a thread of cobweb covered in dew that was collected under the light of a full moon."
