Erqynaks icy breath was an arcane evocation spell that rapidly chilled water without freezing it.
A submerged spellcaster used this spell to chill a cone of water in front of them below the waters actual freezing point without forming ice. It was a particularly useful offensive spell when underwater.
This spell was developed by the ixzan Erqynak.
