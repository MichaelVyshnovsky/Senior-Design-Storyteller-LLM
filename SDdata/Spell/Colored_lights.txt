'''''Colored lights''''' was a minor [[illusion]] [[cantrip]] that acolyte [[illusionist]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It produced one to four glowing spheres of light in a chosen color that only illuminated their immediate surroundings.

==Effects==
This cantrip created one, two, three, or four globes with diameters of {{SI|12|in|c|long=yes}}, {{SI|6|in|c|long=yes}}, {{SI|4|in|c|long=yes}}, or {{SI|3|in|c|long=yes}}, respectively. The area illuminated by each sphere was limited to five diameters, so the {{SIAdj|12|in|c}} globe shone for {{SI|5|ft|c|long=yes}} in all directions while the light from the {{SIAdj|3|in|c}} globes was only useful out to {{SI|15|in|c|long=yes}}. At {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} away, the spheres cast no reflections and from {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} away they were completely undetectable.

The color was chosen at the time of casting and was limited to pale, unsaturated shades of common colors. Within the area of effect, pink light would not interfere with [[infravision]] and blue light would not inhibit [[ultravision]], but all other hues were detrimental to these types of perception.

The spheres floated within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the caster, or rested on their person as directed. They could be moved about and placed as desired, and they lasted for as long as the caster maintained concentration.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster spoke the number and color of globes desired and then a magic word, such as ''noma'' or ''mazda''<ref group="note">"[[wikipedia:NOMA (company)|NOMA]]" was a brand name of various Christmas and holiday lights and "[[wikipedia:Mazda_(light_bulb)|Mazda]]" was the trademark name for tungsten-filament incandescent light bulbs made by [[wikipedia:General Electric|General Electric]]. while gesturing where the lights were to be placed using one finger for each globe.
