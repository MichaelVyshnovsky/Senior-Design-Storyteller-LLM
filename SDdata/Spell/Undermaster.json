        "mainbody": "'''''Undermaster''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that gave the caster a wide range of earth-related spells.",
        "Effects": "On casting ''Undermaster'', the caster gained the ability to innately cast a wide range of spells as long as he or she was in contact with the ground. The spells in question were ''[[burrow]]'', ''[[earthquake]]'', ''[[excavate]]'', ''[[flesh to stone]]'', ''[[meld into stone]]'', ''[[move earth]]'', ''[[reverse gravity]]'', ''[[soften earth and stone]]'', ''[[statue]]'', ''[[stone shape]]'', ''[[stone sphere]]'', ''[[stone tell]]'', ''[[stone to flesh]]'', ''[[transmute mud to rock]]'', ''[[transmute rock to mud]]'', and ''[[wall of stone]]''. Each of these spells could be cast once per day.",
        "Components": "''Undermaster'' required only [[verbal component]]s, but casting this spell drained also the caster's essence."
