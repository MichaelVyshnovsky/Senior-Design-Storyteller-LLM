        "mainbody": "all bones was an obscure yet lethal elven spell.\nWhen the spell was cast, any of the targets bones that the caster chose simply tore free of their meat and floated quickly towards the caster. Doing this to a living persons skull was bound to kill them.\nThe spell had been developed by Napraeleon Echorn to more efficiently part meat from bones when working on larger prey, eight or seven centuries prior to the year , in roughly . In , his descendant, Delmuth Echorn, attempted to use it in order to slay Elminster Aumar. The spell was reflected, killing Delmuth and turning his skull into a hazard that Elminster reflected with his shield the skull was still flying fast enough to strike a distant person some time later, Athtar Nlossae, and kill him.\nThe sorceress Dasumia used a similar spell to slay the Chosen of Mystra Nadrathen during her takeover of Galadorna in , though her version pushed the bones out and made them fall to the ground, rather than attract them violently. Elminster later used a perfected version of a similar spell in , deboning a number of Cormyrean nobles in protection of their king, Foril Obarskyr I."
