'''''Dire radiance''''' is among the most basic [[spell]]s known to [[warlock]]s of the [[Warlock#Star Pact Warlock|star pact]]. ''Dire radiance'', when cast, allows the warlock to call forth a shaft of brilliant, chilling light from the heavens, using it to cause excruciating pain to a creature within fifty feet. If the creature attempts to approach the warlock, the beam intensifies, causing even greater pain. The potency of ''dire radiance'' is largely determined by the constitution of the warlock casting it and warlocks of great experience and power cast a significantly more powerful version of the spell.
