        "mainbody": "'''darkenbeast''', also called a '''death horror''' or '''dark horror''', was an artificial magical beast created by evil spellcasters. They were transformed from ordinary animals into terrifying monsters loyal to their master's will.",
        "Description": "Darkenbeasts were 3–5 ft (0.9–1.5 meters) long and had wings that could extend to twice the length of their bodies, ranging from 6–10 ft (1.8–3.0 meters).",
        "Behavior": "Darkenbeasts were almost completely loyal to their creators and followed their commands to the best of their ability, even if said action would result in certain death. The only exception to this was if ordered to attack their original master. Darkenbeasts ordered to commit violence against their masters might break free of the spell's control, staying in their new form but acting normally and following their normal masters.",
        "Combat": "The darkenbeast dived down from the air, attacking their target with a combination of fang and talon. They were immune to any form of mental magic, only obeying the telepathic commands of the caster, who gave limited orders based on mental images. They were remarkably durable and treated themselves as expendable during any combat situation, requiring their masters to consciously pull them out of pointless melee. At the point of creation, a spellcaster could imprint a spell into the death horror's being, allowing them to cast the spell if the creature was nearby. This process had a 25% chance of killing the death horror, increasing if more darkenbeasts were imprinted by 10%. Regardless of the spell's success or failure, a darkenbeast with its spell evoked would die in a spout of magical purple flame, causing them to revert to their true form.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "No matter what their true forms were, darkenbeasts were always carnivorous.",
            "Habitats": "Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], some could be found in the [[Domains of Dread]]. They could particularly be found in the domain of [[Hazlik]], where they acted as guardians over his estate and other strongholds.",
            "Relationships": "Mages in the [[Underdark]] were known to keep packs of darkenbeasts as guards and flying assassins."

        "History": "[[File:Darkenbeast spellfire.png|thumb|315x315px|''A fierce darkenbeast.'']]\nThe [[Red Wizards of Thay]] were well known for their use of darkenbeasts against the people of [[Rashemen]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1362 DR]] a Red Wizard [[Maligor]] used alteration magic to shapeshift hundreds if not thousands of animals into darkenbeasts to be used as bloodhounds; the components for the spell included [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, a [[moonstone]] focus, and dried [[wyvern]] blood as the [[material component]].\n\nIn [[1369 DR]] Zhentarim mages created darkenbeasts to attack the adventurers carrying the [[Sword of the Dales]].\n\nBy [[1373 DR]], Maligor's spell that created the monsters became common among Red Wizards, and many [[zulkir]]s had personal armies of [[gnoll]]s and darkenbeasts. The same year, the Zulkir of [[Necromancy]] [[Szass Tam]] used his abundant [[juju zombie]] and darkenbeast army to stand against [[Eltab]] father the demon was freed from its imprisonment. A psionic [[duergar]] ally, [[Justikar Stoneblood]] was able to mentally command the [[lich]]'s flock of darkenbeasts, leading them into battle."
