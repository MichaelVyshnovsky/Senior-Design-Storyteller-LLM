        "mainbody": "Lesser confusion, also known as random action, was an enchantment spell that made a target being act randomly for a brief period. It was a lesser form of the longer-running confusion spell.In the change from 3 edition to v.3.5 D&D, this spell was renamed from random action to lesser confusion.\nThe spell could be cast by beginner bardsIn the changeover, this spell was changed from a divine spell for clerics to an arcane spell for bards. This wiki uses the later, official version. and clerics with the Mentalism domain.\nCast against one living creature nearby whose mind could be affected, this spell compelled them to become confused and act at random for several seconds. They might attack the caster, attack the nearest creature even if it was an ally, run away, stand and simple babble, or even act as they would have normally.\nIt required verbal and somatic components, while clerics also required a divine focus.In the updated spell description, the clerics need for a divine focus was mistakenly retained though bards should have no need for it, somewhat confusingly. Fortunately, it may still be required by Mentalism clerics."
