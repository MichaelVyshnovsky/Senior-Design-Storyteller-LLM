'''''Horrendous dessication''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] of [[epic magic]].

==Effects==
''Horrendous dessication'' caused everything to dry up within a large area that grew with the caster's skill. The effect caused organic matter to dry up, the degree of which increased with the caster's skill, and could easily lead to death. The same happened to bodies of water like lakes or rivers. Such places lost a large amount of their water.

The caster was safe from the drying effect. However, casting this spell caused one of the caster's limbs to wither.

==Components==
''Horrendous dessication'' required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s. The material component was one dose of ''[[dust of dryness]]''.

==History==
By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''horrendous dessication'' was considered to be one of the most fearsome spells ever developed on [[Faer√ªn]].
