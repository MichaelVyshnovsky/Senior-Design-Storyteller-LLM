'''''Swordward''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]], [[evocation]], and [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Torm]], enabling them to create a unique guardian effect.

==Effects==
All harm inflicted upon enemies within the ''swordward's'' area of effect would be transferred as healing magic to the caster or their allies. Furthermore, attacks from enemies within the area were less likely to strike and caused less physical harm. This spell could not coexist with a ''[[blade barrier]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s an [[amethyst]] worth at least 5 [[gp]], a piece of a [[lodestone]], and an edged weapon, or piece of one, that has drawn blood in battle to cast.
