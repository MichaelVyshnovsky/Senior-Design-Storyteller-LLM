        "mainbody": "Tree stride, also known as pass plant, was a conjuration or alteration spell that allowed the caster to enter a tree and then teleport to a distant tree of the same type, and repeat for the duration of the spell.\nThis spell was an improvement on the plant door spell, allowing the caster to not only step inside a tree, but also jump to other similar trees within range. Upon entering the first tree, the caster immediately knew the location of all other acceptable trees within the range of the spell. They had to be alive, of the same type (oak, maple, pine, etc.), and big enough to contain the caster in all dimensions. The caster then had the choice of teleporting to one of the candidate trees, staying hidden inside the first tree, or stepping back out. If a jump was made, then the process could be repeated, from tree to tree, as many times as the caster had experience levels.\nThe conjuration version of tree stride allowed the caster to stay hidden inside one or more trees for a number of hours equal to the maximum number of trees that could be traversed, whereas the alteration version only lasted for as many minutes as the maximum number of trees. After the spell expired, the caster was ejected from the tree he or she currently occupied. The spell also terminated upon stepping out of any tree, and like plant door, if the tree being occupied was cut down or burned, the caster would also die unless egress was made before the process was complete.\nThe type of tree had an influence on the distance that could be traversed. Oak, ash, and yew trees had the greatest range, elm and linden somewhat less, followed by other deciduous trees, then the conifers, and finally all other (probably rare or exotic) trees. The ranges for the alteration and conjuration versions of this spell are given below.\nVerbal and somatic components, plus at least one tree that meets the conditions above, were required to cast this spell."
