Protection from telekinesis was an uncommon abjuration spell of the southern magic tradition.
The spell protected the caster from levitate, repulsion and telekinesis spells but was vulnerable against reverse gravity, teleport and other teleportation spells. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a block or slab of black granite.
