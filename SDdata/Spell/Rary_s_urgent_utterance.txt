'''''Rary's urgent utterance''''' was a [[spell]] that allowed a caster to quickly cast a spell.

==Effects==
This spell was used by casters to have a spell ready to cast quickly. This spell was cast first, followed by the spell the cast wished to cast. The caster spoke all the verbal component of a spell except the last word. The spell was then "stored" in the caster's memory for up to 24 hours. Speaking the final word of the verbal component cast the saved spell. Nearly all low-to-mid level spells functioned with this spell.

==Casting==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a [[material component]], a single [[sapphire]] with a value of at least 1,000 [[gp]]. The caster crushed the sapphire during casting.
==History==
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
