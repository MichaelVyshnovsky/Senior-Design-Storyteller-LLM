Rarys urgent utterance was a spell that allowed a caster to quickly cast a spell.
This spell was used by casters to have a spell ready to cast quickly. This spell was cast first, followed by the spell the cast wished to cast. The caster spoke all the verbal component of a spell except the last word. The spell was then "stored" in the casters memory for up to 24 hours. Speaking the final word of the verbal component cast the saved spell. Nearly all low-to-mid level spells functioned with this spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a single sapphire with a value of at least 1,000 gp. The caster crushed the sapphire during casting.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
