Nar fiendbond was a transmutation spell that transformed a person into a half-fiend. It was presumably developed by the Nars.
The spell imbued a volunteer or victim with the essence of the fiendish planes, granting them powers as if they were the offspring of a full-blooded fiend.
The spell required a fortune in gems.
