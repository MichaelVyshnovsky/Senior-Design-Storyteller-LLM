Azundels purification was an abjuration spell that destroyed all the inherent or transferred magic from a given item.
This spell would obliterate any curses, tracers, dweomers, and magical remnants, including arcane spells and spell-like powers, from a single non-living item, a pile of dry or powdered materials or a body of liquid.
The material components for this spell were a pinch of powder from a crushed focal stone, a flawless diamond, and three drops of a potion of sweetwater.
