Earth tremor was an evocation spell that caused a brief but violent tremor in the ground around the caster.
Upon casting earth tremor, the area within  of the caster shook violently, damaging and knocking down all creatures that could not brace themselves, except for the caster. Although brief, the intense tremor also uplifted loose earth and stone, covering the area with debris that made it difficult to traverse until cleared.
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
