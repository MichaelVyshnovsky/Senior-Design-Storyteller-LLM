'''''Icy terrain''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] learned by some beginning [[wizard]]s that used cold terrain to impede their foes.

==Effect==
When a wizard cast ''icy terrain'', he or she filled a small area within 50 feet (15 feet) with a thick layer of ice, which caused any creatures within the area's 5-foot (1.5 meter) diameter without fast enough reflexes to slip and fall to the ground. For the next few moments, the affected terrain impeded enemy movement.
