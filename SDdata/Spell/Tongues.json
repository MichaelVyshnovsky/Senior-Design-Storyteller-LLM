        "mainbody": "Tongues was a divination or alteration spell that allowed the caster or a touched creature to speak and understand additional languages. The alteration version was reversible, called either babble,The 2nd edition made some adjustments to this spell that were contradictory and confusing. The area of effect for the divine version was changed from a  radius circle to the caster, which makes no sense when reversing this spell.\nThe divination version of tongues was much improved over the alteration version because it could be bestowed on another creature, had greater range, and lasted 10 minutes per level of the caster, but it was not reversible. whereas the arcane variation lasted one minute per level of the caster. The area of effect for the alteration version was a circle of  radius centered on the caster, whereas the divination spell allowed the subject to communicate as far as his or her voice could carry.\nThe subject of tongues could only speak one language at a time but could understand other languages, therefore the subject could act as an interpreter but could not address a diverse crowd and be understood by all. This spell only allowed communication with intelligent creatures with the ability to speak it did not otherwise bias creatures with respect to the subject.\nWhen cast in reverse, babble canceled the tongues spell or confused all verbal communication in the area of effect, even between those that shared a common language.\nThe divine versions of this spell required only verbal and somatic components.Historically, the Tower of Babel was thought to have been a ziggurat. which shattered when the verbal component was pronounced.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Dace in  and was originally called Daces tongue forms."
