For this spell to work the target and caster needed to speak the same language.\n\nIf the spell succeeds, the target would be unable to do anything relating to the caster for the spell's duration. If they did anything relating to the caster the target would stand helpless as horrible images assaulted their mind.\n\nWizards used this spell to keep people from mentioning the wizard's presence, usually in regard to the wizard being in a place where they were not supposed to be.\n\nThis spell could only be used by evil wizards.",
