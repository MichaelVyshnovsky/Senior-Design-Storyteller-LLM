        "mainbody": "Undead aides was a rare spell used by necromancers.\nWhen cast, this spell gave a skeleton or zombie limited sentience and the ability to perform simple tasks. The amount of skeletons or zombies affected was based on the casters skill level. The targeted undead was able to speak, and could react to situations. The spell lasted as long as the skeleton or zombie was animated.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, a brain from a dragon and bone fragments from a human.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
