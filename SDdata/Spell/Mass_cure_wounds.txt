'''''Mass cure light wounds''''', also known as '''''healing circle''''', was a prayer or [[conjuration]] spell that applied an enhanced ''[[cure light wounds]]'' to a small group of creatures.The spell ''healing circle'' in 3rd-edition D&D was renamed and revised to ''mass cure light wounds'' in 3.5-edition D&D. After the [[Second Sundering]], it became known simply as '''''mass cure wounds'''''.

==Effects==
Like other ''cure'' spells, the caster channeled [[positive energy]] that healed the living or harmed the [[undead]].

Following the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], [[positive energy]] emanated from the caster in all directions to a radius of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}}, bestowing healing equivalent to a ''cure light wounds'' on all creatures in the area. However, soon after, only a limited number of creatures according to the power of the caster could receive this spell, and they all had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of each other, but the caster was not required to touch the recipients, nor be at the center.

Versions of this spell in use after the Second Sundering caused a wave of healing to emanate from a point within up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of the caster, affecting up to six creatures in a {{SIAdj|30|ft}} range from the point of origin.

==Components==
The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
