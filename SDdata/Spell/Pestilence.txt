'''''Pestilence''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Maztica]]. The spell allowed a caster to summon insects, arthropods, and other invertebrates.

==Effects==
This spell was a less powerful version of the ''[[insect plague]]'' spell used in [[Faer√ªn]]. The main difference between this spell and ''insect plague'' was that ''pestilence'' had a longer duration. Like ''insect plague'', this spell summoned all types of crawling invertebrates, such as [[ant]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[caterpillar]]s, [[roach]]es, [[spider]]s, and others. They then infested the target area, consuming plants and causing animals to flee. The spell could clear an area of plants within a day. Any individual within the area received numerous bites and stings. Once cast, the infested area could not be moved.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: some [[venom]] from a spider and a dead [[june bug]].
