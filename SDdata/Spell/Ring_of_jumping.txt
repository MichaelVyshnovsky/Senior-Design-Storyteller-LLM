Rings of jumping were magical rings worn by many adventurers across Faer√ªn.
The ring allowed the wearer to continually jump about, making movement easier, and to access hidden areas. The wearer could also use the ring to jump over walls, which would not be accessible otherwise.Spellfire Master the Magic
