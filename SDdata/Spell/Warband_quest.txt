Warband quest was a divine enchantment quest spell from the charm and war spheres that affected a group of up to 200 creatures with the quest spell.
The targets of this spell remained within control of the magic so long as they were under orders releated to the specific quest for which the warband quest was granted. All affected targets received a boost in their vitality based upon the skill of the caster, had unflinching morale, and enjoyed the benefits of the prayer spell.
This spell did not require spell components of any kind to cast.
Duerra granted the warband quest spell to Olorn Ridaugaur.
