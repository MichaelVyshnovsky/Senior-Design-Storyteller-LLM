Roar of the king was a divine evocation spell used by specialty priests devoted to Nobanion called Firemanes, enabling them to shout with ear-piercing power.
This spell boosted the vocal strength of the caster, allowing them to shriek with ear-piercing power like a male lion, temporarily deafening any creature within  in front of the caster. The roar was so powerful that it would also physically harm targets and shatter brittle equipment on their person.
Roar of the king was not capable of penetrating a silence, 15 radius spell. The roar could be heard up to a mile away, making it an effective way raise an alarm. The spell could be cast repeatedly during the same day.
In addition to verbal components, this spell required as material components a drop of honey, a piece of cinnamon bark, a small piece of meat, and a piece of amber worth at least 20 gp to cast.
