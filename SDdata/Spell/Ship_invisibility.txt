Ship invisibility was a spell that turned a ship invisible. It was rarely used in the Sea of Fallen Stars and even rarer still elsewhere on Toril.
When cast, the ship that the caster was aboard became temporarily invisible. Any creatures or cargo on board also became invisible. Anyone within the spells area of effect saw each other and the ship normally. However, the invisibility effect was not perfect. A keen eye could detect the ships wake or other disruptions in the water. Anyone who left the spells area of effect, or if an item was tossed overboard, became visible. The spells invisibility effect ended if the ship engaged in any sort of combat. The spell could also prematurely expire if the ship traveled too fast.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components A splinter of wood from the ship that the spell was to be cast upon, and  a single tentacle from a jellyfish.
The wizards of the Sea of Fallen Stars cherished this spell and took great lengths to conceal the casting process and components required.
