Horizikauls boom was a spell used by sorcerers and wizards.
When cast, the spell bombarded a targeted creature with an incredibly loud high-pitched sonic attack. It could strike a moving target. The targeted creature suffered from sonic damage and was temporarily deafened. If the targeted creature was within an area of effect of a silence spell, the spell had no effect.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
