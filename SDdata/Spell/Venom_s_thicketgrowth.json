        "mainbody": "'''''Venom's thicketgrowth''''' was a [[spell]] that could only be cast by [[dragon]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell caused the primary vegetation in a {{SI|90|cu. ft|long=yes}} area to spread to an adjoining area. The spell did not kill any existing vegetation in the area, but it usually withered within a year of the spell being cast as a result of being overwhelmed by the presence of the new primary vegetation. It was often used in combination with ''[[Venom's brambletangle]]''.",
        "Casting": "This spell required only a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component.",
        "History": "This spell was created by the [[green dragon]] Venominhandar. It was often used by green dragons in [[Cormanthor]] to build their lairs. Legend had it that Venominhandar used this spell along with ''[[Venom's brambletangle]]'' to alter the Emerald Vale into the [[Tangled Vale]]."
