        "mainbody": "Venoms thicketgrowth was a spell that could only be cast by dragons.\nWhen cast, this spell caused the primary vegetation in a  area to spread to an adjoining area. The spell did not kill any existing vegetation in the area, but it usually withered within a year of the spell being cast as a result of being overwhelmed by the presence of the new primary vegetation. It was often used in combination with Venoms brambletangle. \nThis spell required only a verbal component.\nThis spell was created by the green dragon Venominhandar. It was often used by green dragons in Cormanthor to build their lairs. Legend had it that Venominhandar used this spell along with Venoms brambletangle to alter the Emerald Vale into the Tangled Vale."
