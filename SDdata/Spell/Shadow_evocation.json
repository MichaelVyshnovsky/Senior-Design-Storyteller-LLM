If the victim recognized the illusion, the shadow energy was a lot less effective than the duplicated spell. A more powerful version of this spell also existed as greater shadow evocation.\nShadow evocation used verbal and somatic components only.\nThe spell was introduced in 3266 NY (−593 DR) by Netherese arcanist and researcher into the planes, Shadow, under the name Shadows magic, later simplified to shadow magic or shadow evocation.\nShadow evocation was an uncommon spell in Faerûn in the 1360s DR"
