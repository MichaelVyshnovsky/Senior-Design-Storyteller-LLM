Final struggle was a contingency evocation and necromancy spell of the 8 circle of magic used by evil wizards to avoid a certain demise and take over a new body.
After the spell was prepared and cast, it remained dormant until the caster was killed. Just like the contingency spell, it activated in a specific circumstanceâ€”the casters death. Once they passed, the casters spirit lingered in the area where their dead body was found. This spirit had one chance at returning to life through a single use of a magic jar spell ingrained in their mind after the transformation into a spirit. The magic jar spell could be cast at any sentient creature within a distance of , or more if the caster was more powerful. If magic jar was successful, then the spirit immediately gained full possession of the victim, while the victims life force was forcefully ejected and lost. In case the target resisted the magic jar spell, the necromancer simply died and went on into their afterlife.
Most successful castings of the final struggle were acts of true evil and turned any good- and neutral-aligned wizard towards a life of malice and destruction. However, in some rare cases that fate was avoided, for example, if the possessed sentient creature was hollow or fully willing to sacrifice themselves for the caster.
The spell called for verbal, somatic, and material components worth at least 1,600 gp that were consumed by the casting. The spell was prepared and incanted over a period of eight hours.
The final struggle spells were foul works of evil and were used by villainous necromancers who were enemies of the Harpers. The knowledge of the spell was deemed dangerous and a copy of the spell was hidden away in one of the many secret Harper vaults. Being a bardic organization, they were unwilling to destroy knowledge, even such vile and evil knowledge. Harpers elected to hide the wondrous items and dark magics away and keep them under lock and key.
