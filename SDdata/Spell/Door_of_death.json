        "Effects": "A dragon cast this spell onto a portal, whether a door or the entrance to a cave. The portal had to have a diameter less than {{SI|30|ft}}. Only the portal itself was warded, the surrounding wall was not. Once cast, any creature crossing the portal without uttering the proper command word became the victim of a ''[[death spell]]''. During casting, the dragon could choose whether the spell was to radiate an aura of necromantic magic. This blue aura was visible in low-light and surrounded the perimeter of the portal.",
        "Casting": "This spell required only a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component."
