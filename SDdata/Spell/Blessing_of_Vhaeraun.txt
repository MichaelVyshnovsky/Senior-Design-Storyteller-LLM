Blessing of Vhaeraun was a spell used by priests of Vhaeraun, the drow god of thievery, to augment their abilities.
The casters abilities were temporarily augmented, but only for a very short time and only for one use. This one use could be expended to increase the accuracy of a physical attack or the abilities as a thief of the caster or another person touched with the spell.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
