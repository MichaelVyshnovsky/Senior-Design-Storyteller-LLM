        "mainbody": "'''''Clear air''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Akadi]], enabling them to create an area with perfectly clear air.",
        "Effects": "This spell created a pocket of perfectly clear air within a {{SI|20|ft}} diameter globe, banishing all smoke, gas, dust, etc. Any creature in gaseous form would be immediately expelled from the globe, nor could they re-enter while the spell was active. This spell was centered on a touched creature and moved with them.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast."
