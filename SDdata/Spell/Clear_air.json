        "mainbody": "Clear air was a divine evocation spell used by specialty priests devoted to Akadi, enabling them to create an area with perfectly clear air.\nThis spell created a pocket of perfectly clear air within a  diameter globe, banishing all smoke, gas, dust, etc. Any creature in gaseous form would be immediately expelled from the globe, nor could they re-enter while the spell was active. This spell was centered on a touched creature and moved with them.\nIn addition to verbal components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol to cast."
