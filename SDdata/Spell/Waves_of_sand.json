        "mainbody": "Waves of sand was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nWith this spell the caster caused the sand surrounding a wagon, or similar vehicle, to undulate like water. The wagon could be carried along as if it were riding a tide. Living creatures surrounding the wagon, such as pack animals, could not pull the wagon while the spell was active.\nThe wagon could travel at a rate of  per hour and the direction was controlled by a mental urging from the caster or anyone else whom the caster designated. The spell would automatically end if the wagon stopped for more than one minute.\nThis spell required the presence of sand to cast."
