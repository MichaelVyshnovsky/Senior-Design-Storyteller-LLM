        "Effects": "With this spell the caster caused the [[sand]] surrounding a [[wagon]], or similar vehicle, to undulate like water. The wagon could be carried along as if it were riding a tide. Living creatures surrounding the wagon, such as pack animals, could not pull the wagon while the spell was active.\n\nThe wagon could travel at a rate of {{SI|3|miles|long=yes}} per hour and the direction was controlled by a mental urging from the caster or anyone else whom the caster designated. The spell would automatically end if the wagon stopped for more than one minute.",
        "Components": "This spell required the presence of sand to cast."
