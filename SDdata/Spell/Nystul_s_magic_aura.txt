'''''Nystul's magic aura''''', also referred to as '''''Mystra's lingering touch''''', and '''''Arcanist's magic aura''''', was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that masked the [[magic]]al aura of an item.

To [[Zakhara]]n mages, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''magic aura''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].

==Effects==
On casting ''Nystul's magic aura'', a touched item would be [[Detect magic|detected]] as either as an utterly non-magical item or as a [[magic item]] of the caster's choosing. For example, the caster could pick up a random sword and make it appear as if it had the ''[[vorpal]]'' quality. However, the spell did not change the appearance of the object; for example, claiming a sword to be a ''vorpal sword'', despite the sword not being of a quality that could hold any magic, was bound to raise suspicions. Furthermore, there was a chance for the magical aura to be determined as fake by means of investigating the enchanted object, for example by using an ''[[identify]]'' spell. 

==Components==
''Nystul's magic aura'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s as well as a focus in the form of a small square of silk that needed to be passed over the item to be enchanted. 

==History==
This spell was made available to the [[dweomerkeeper]]s who served [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]], the third personification of the Goddess of Magic.
