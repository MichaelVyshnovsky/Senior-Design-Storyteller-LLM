            "Old Demonweb Pits": "When [[Quenthel Baenre]] and her companions visited the Demonweb Pits in the Abyss during the Silence of Lolth in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, they found the realm unusually empty of souls. The realm consisted of black emptiness with an acrid smell and giant spider web. It was very hot there. The Pits were covered in corpses of monsters and [[demon]]s lying dead and dying, particularly [[goristro]]s. Lolth dwelt in a black temple suspended in the web. Her stone face covered the entrance.\n\nWhen Quenthel's expedition returned to the same location in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, they found the Demonweb Pits abandoned and in ruins. A [[gate]] guarded by [[abyssal widow]]s led to the new Demonweb Pits.",
            "New Demonweb Pits": "The new Demonweb Pits was a plane of rocks with chasms and rocky gorges. There were many pits and craters. The land looked dead. There were giant petrified spiders with webbing over everything from the songspiders. There was a distant red sun during the day and eight bright red stars at night.\n\nThere was a river of souls flowing to Lolth's city, an iron citadel in the Infinite Web. Lolth stood atop a dais in a temple on a pyramid with webs on the walls.\n\nThere were a number of geographical features on the plane, including the [[Plains of Soulfire]] and the [[Pass of the Soulreaver]] at the base of the [[Mountain of Eyes]].\n\nThe plane was inhabited by [[spider]]s (including [[songspider]]s) and [[chwidencha]]. The [[Soulreaver]] dwelt in the Pass of the Soulreaver and was a gray spectral form, with a bloated serpentine body containing screaming drow souls.\n\nAfter the [[Second Sundering]], Lolth returned her realm to the Abyss."

        "Notables": "- [[Giismekhan]] a powerful and favored [[draegloth]] of [[Lolth]]\n\n- [[Ozebaw the Unwholesome]] a [[dretch]] [[demon]]",
        "Gods and Domains": "All drow gods were originally located in the Demonweb Pits and Lolth claimed to be the queen of them all. \n\nLolth resided in a huge [[iron]] fortress that moved under its mistress's will on spider-like legs.\n\nLolth's son, [[Vhaeraun]], maintained a realm named [[Ellaniath]] where he schemed against his mother almost constantly, an activity Lolth actually encouraged.\n\nLolth's daughter, [[Eilistraee]], also had a place in the Demonweb pits, but her main realm was in [[Ysgard]] and later in [[Arvandor]], and she left her realm in the Demonweb Pits almost abandoned.<ref><ref><ref>\n\n[[Kiaransalee]] had her own citadel made of bones called Thanatos in a desolate area of the plane. It was named for her own layer of the Abyss, [[Thanatos (Abyss)|Thanatos]], which was stolen from her by the reincarnated demon prince [[Orcus]].\n\n[[Ghaunadaur]] resided at the very bottom of the pits, surrounded by slime and fungus that caused multicolored lights to appear.\n\n[[Selvetarm]] resided with the Spider Queen without maintaining a realm of his own."
