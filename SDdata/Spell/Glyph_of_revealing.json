        "mainbody": "Glyph of revealing was a divine spell used by priests devoted to Deneir.\nA priest of Denier would use special ink to draw a glyph on any horizontal surface. Upon its completion the glyph would glow briefly then vanish, causing all magical auras within a  radius to glow with white light similar to faerie fire for several hours. Any glowing aura could be read and identified without triggering their effect. The glyph of revealing could be moved around for the spells duration if initially drawn on a portable object.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a special ink composed of crushed eyebright juice, chalk, and quartz powder to cast."
