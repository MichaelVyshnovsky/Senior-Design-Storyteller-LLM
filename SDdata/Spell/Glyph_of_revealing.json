        "mainbody": "'''''Glyph of revealing''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Deneir]].",
        "Effects": "A priest of Denier would use special ink to draw a glyph on any horizontal surface. Upon its completion the glyph would glow briefly then vanish, causing all magical auras within a {{SI|120|ft}} radius to glow with white light similar to ''[[faerie fire]]'' for several hours. Any glowing aura could be read and identified without triggering their effect. The ''glyph of revealing'' could be moved around for the spell's duration if initially drawn on a portable object.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a special ink composed of crushed [[eyebright]] juice, [[chalk]], and [[quartz]] powder to cast."
