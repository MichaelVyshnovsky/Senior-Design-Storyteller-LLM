        "Effects": "This spell enveloped the caster or a target they touched with a protective magical field. By default this protective field was invisible but could be made to appear a different color and even with effects like shimmering if the caster wished.\n\nThe ''improved mantle'' warded the target from all mundane weapons and many magical ones as well. It also protected against all medium-powered spells or effects from [[magic item]]s.\n\nIf this spell came into contact with another ''improved mantle'' or Alustriel's regular ''[[Alustriel's mantle|mantle]]'', then both protected targets were wracked with a dreadfully painful chaotic force which would stun them as the mantles collapsed.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a gem worth at least 50 [[gp]] and a vial of air that the caster breathed into and stoppered at least one day before casting the spell to cast."
