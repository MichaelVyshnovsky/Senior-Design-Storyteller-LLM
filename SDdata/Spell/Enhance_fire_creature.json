        "Effects": "This spell toughened fire creatures. This spell affected any creature from the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], creatures that could manipulate fire, and creatures that lived in fire. This spell did nothing for creatures that simply cast fire-based spells. Creatures affected by this spell had their attacks strengthened and were more resistant to damage.\n\n'''''Quench fire creature''''' was the reverse of this spell and had the exact opposite effect.",
        "Components": "This spell required a rag seeped in [[pitch]] to cast."
