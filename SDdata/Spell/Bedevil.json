        "mainbody": "'''''Bedevil''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that attached an annoying spirit to the target.",
        "Effects": "On casting ''bedevil'', an annoying spirit was attached to the target, who needed to be on the same [[plane]] as the caster. This spirit annoyed the target. For example, the target saw some moving figment out of the corner of his or her eye, interrupting sleep, and so on. For arcane spellcasters, ''bedevil'' caused some real problems that went above simple annoyance. When an arcane spellcaster who became a target of this spell tried to cast a spell, the spirit disrupted this caster with a feeling of being haunted and being under observation. These disruptions could lead to failure of spellcasting. ''Bedevil'' had an extremely long duration that was measured in days.\n\nThe spirit's existence could be confirmed with a ''[[detect evil]]'' spell. They could be barred from annoying the target by casting  ''[[protection from evil]]'' on the target. While it was impossible to rid the target of the spirit with a ''[[remove curse]]'', it was possible with the ''[[dispel evil]]'' spell.",
        "Components": "''Bedevil'' required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s. The material components were a statuette of a [[devil]] or [[imp]] and the target's blood; a drop was enough. The blood could be perfectly substituted with a personal object of the target.",
        "History": "[[Imbrar I]], a [[blackguard]] in the service of [[Soneillon]], regularly prepared the ''bedevil'' spell."
