Thunder slam is a spell of the evocation school used by some sorcerers early in their training. When cast, thunder slam causes a burst of sonic energy to burst from the sorcerers implement, blowing a creature within fifty feet a distance of fifteen. Thunder slam is somewhat complex for its level of power and as such requires a rest of a few minutes before being cast again.
