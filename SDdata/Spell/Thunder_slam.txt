'''''Thunder slam''''' is a [[spell]] of the [[evocation school]] used by some [[sorcerer]]s early in their training. When cast, ''thunder slam'' causes a burst of sonic energy to burst from the sorcerer's [[implement]], blowing a creature within fifty feet a distance of fifteen. ''Thunder slam'' is somewhat complex for its level of power and as such requires a rest of a few minutes before being cast again.
