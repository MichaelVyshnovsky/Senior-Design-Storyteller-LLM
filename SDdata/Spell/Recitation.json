        "mainbody": "Recitation was an abjuration/evocation spell that invoked a deitys blessing on a battle aiding the caster and any allies while hindering any enemies in the area of effect. A later version of this spell fell under the divine domain of creation, within the school of conjuration.\nThis spell was cast by reading out loud a passage or declaration of a sacred text related to the casters religion. For the duration of the spell, the caster and all allies were given a boost to their combat skills and made to strike harder against their foes. Allies of the same religion were given extra luck and strength. Likewise, all enemies were confused and doubtful and made unable to muster their full strength in combat. The area of effect was a 60 ft (18.3 m) circle centered on the caster. Once the spell was completed, the caster was free to do other things.\nThis spell stacked with prayer and chant so that the effects of any two or all three spells were cumulative.\nSomatic gestures were required as the priest read the holy text out loud while holding or wearing a holy symbol."
