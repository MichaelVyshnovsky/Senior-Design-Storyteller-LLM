        "mainbody": "Bigbys forceful hand was an evocation spell similar to Bigbys interposing hand.\nWhen cast, this spell created a hand of force. This hand followed and shoved at a targeted creature, even a very strong one. The hand would push the targeted creature right to the distance limit of the spell. The spell was strong enough to slow a moving spelljammer.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a strong glove made from either cloth or leather."
