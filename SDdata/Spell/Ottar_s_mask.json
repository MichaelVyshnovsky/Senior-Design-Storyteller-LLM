        "Effects": "This spell allowed either the caster or a target they touched to assume the visage and appearance of any other being visible to the caster when the spell was cast. The appearance was a perfect replica, including by scent and texture, from the front only. The disguise was even undetectable from magical prying.\n\nNatural abilities, such as [[infravision]], of the host subject were even transferred to the target of the spell. Magical or spell-like abilities were not transferred nor were physical attributes like strength and dexterity.\n\n''Ottar's mask'' even transferred species-specific immunities or weaknesses to poison and disease. The target of the spell could cancel the disguise at any time before the spell expired.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a piece of skin and eyelash from a living creature to cast.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Only a few [[Harper]] agents and the women of the [[Seven Sisters]] were known to use this spell. It was rumored that some witches of [[Rashemen]] had access to this magic as well."
