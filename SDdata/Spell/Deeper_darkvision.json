        "mainbody": "Deeper darkvision was a transmutation spell that gave the target a special form of darkvision.\nOn casting deeper darkvision, the creature the caster touched gained a form of special darkvision that allowed the caster to see through darkness, not only mundane darkness, but even those created by magical means like darkness or deeper darkness. The eyes of the recipient glowed with a purple glint.\nThe vision within darkness was only in black and white but very otherwise unproblematic.\nDeeper darkness required somatic, verbal, and material components to cast. The material component was either a pinch of dried carrot that was thrown at the castings conclusion or an agate."
