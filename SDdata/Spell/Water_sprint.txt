Water sprint was a divine alteration spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Sebek called Swamplords.
This spell allowed the caster to swim three times faster than normal for one minute. The caster had several hours to use the ability before it expired once the spell was cast.
Swamplords often employed this spell while hunting, waiting in crocodile form and bursting forth with great speed to catch prey.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
