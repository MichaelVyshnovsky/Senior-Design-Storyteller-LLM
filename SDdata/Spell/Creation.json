        "mainbody": "Creation was an illusion spell that took threads of the Shadowfell to form an inanimate object.\nThe spell created an object familiar to the caster no larger than a cube 5 ft (1.5 m) on a side, although more powerful casters could create larger objects. The object could be soft goods, wood or even mineral or metallic, but the time the object lasted depended on its composition. An object made from vegetable material could last for up to a day, whereas something composed of or including adamantine or mithral lasted only a minute. If the object created by this spell was used as a material component for another spell, that spell would then fail.\nTo cast this spell the caster needed verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was a tiny piece of the material composing the item the spell was supposed to create."
