'''''Dead march''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to priests of [[Kelemvor]].

==Effects==
When cast, the spell animated multiple corpses or body parts. The amount was determined by the caster's skill level. In a graveyard, corpses as deep as {{SI|14|ft|long=yes}} could be used for the spell. The spell did not grant undeath, nor did the animated corpses posses any sentience or hostile intent.

The animated corpses or body parts were controlled by the caster's will. The spell continued if the caster began casting another spell. Animated corpses could walk underwater or even right off a cliff, they would continue walking in whatever direction the caster sends them.

Since they were not undead, the animated corpses were immune to any spell that affected or controlled the undead. Nor could they be ''[[Turn undead|turned]]''.

Common uses for this spell included dressing the animated corpses in uniforms to deceive a foe, or using them as a form of light transport. 

==History==
This spell was inscribed within the [[Kelemvor]]ite [[relic]] the ''[[Testament of Vraer]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, a drumstick or a chicken's leg and a length of thread.
