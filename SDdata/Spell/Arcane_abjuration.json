        "mainbody": "Arcane abjuration was a channel divinity power granted to clerics of the Arcana domain.\nBy presenting their holy symbol at a single celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend, the cleric could compel it to turn and flee for up to one minute.\nMore powerful clerics using this power on a creature that was not on its native plane could banish it for one minute. The stronger the cleric became, the stronger the creatures that were susceptible to being banished by this power.\nOnly the clerics holy symbol was required to evoke this power."
