Divine revelry, also known as Galerian revelry, was mage spell created and used by Gale Dekarios of Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR.
When cast, divine revelry conjured forth a barrel of firewine or Shadowdark ale from the Yawning Portal tavern of Waterdeep that materialized within  from the caster. Additionally to the alcohol, the spell affected all creatures within  of the barrel in a similar way to the Ottos irresistible dance spell, forcing them to revel, shuffle, and dance ecstatically. If the affected creatures failed to resist the magics compulsion, they were rendered unable to to move or do anything else and were vulnerable to all attacks.
