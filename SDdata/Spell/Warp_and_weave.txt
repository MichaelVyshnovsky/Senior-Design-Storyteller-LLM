'''''Warp and weave''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to glean information about a recently released spell or magical effect.

==Effects==
This spell was effective when cast shortly after the effects of another spell were released or immediately after a magical item was discharged. The [[cleric]] who cast ''warp and weave'' immediately learned a variety of information regarding these magical effects. They became aware of the spell or magic item's name, whether it was [[divine]] or [[arcane]] in nature, the [[sphere]] and [[school of magic]] from which it originated, along with any [[material component]]s that were used in its casting or creation.

Additionally, the caster received rather obscure visions that partially demonstrated how the magical effects could be countered or nullified.

==History==
The specifications of this spell could be displayed by the [[relic]] known as the ''[[Scepter of Mystra]]''.

==Components==
''Warp and weave'' required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components in order to be cast.
