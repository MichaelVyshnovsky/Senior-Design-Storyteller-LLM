Warp and weave was a divination spell that allowed the caster to glean information about a recently released spell or magical effect.
This spell was effective when cast shortly after the effects of another spell were released or immediately after a magical item was discharged. The cleric who cast warp and weave immediately learned a variety of information regarding these magical effects. They became aware of the spell or magic items name, whether it was divine or arcane in nature, the sphere and school of magic from which it originated, along with any material components that were used in its casting or creation.
Additionally, the caster received rather obscure visions that partially demonstrated how the magical effects could be countered or nullified.
The specifications of this spell could be displayed by the relic known as the Scepter of Mystra.
Warp and weave required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast.
