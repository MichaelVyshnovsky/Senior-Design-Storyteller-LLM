        "mainbody": "Truename was a powerful arcane enchantment and alteration spell that granted tremendous power over any creature that had a true name.\nIf the caster was able to determine the true name of a creature after extensive research, that name was called out during the casting and followed by a recitation of the history of the creature. The caster could then decide to polymorph the creature, give them multiple suggestions, transport the creature to a desired location, weaken them to the point of surrender, or utterly dominate the creature to the point where they behaved like a slave or loyal servant.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThe truename spell was originally developed in the Outer Planes that leaned towards lawful alignment. At some point, this spell was inscribed within the Tome of Shaping Secrets.\nThis spell was especially popular among people on the plane of Acheron."
