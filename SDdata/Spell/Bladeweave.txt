'''''Bladeweave''''' was an [[arcane]] [[illusion]] [[spell]] from the second circle of magic that affected the caster's weapon. The spell could be used by [[bard]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
When the spell's words were uttered, ''bladeweave'' imbued the caster's weapon with a scintillating pattern or the hum of a dazzling rhythm. This weapon then could be used in battle to land strikes that had a chance of dazzling their targets. Additionally, such weapons could simply be used to swiftly touch an opponent. Such a touch dealt no damage but still could render the target dazed. The duration of the spell increased with the spellcaster's magical prowess.

==Components==
The spell required only a [[verbal component]].
