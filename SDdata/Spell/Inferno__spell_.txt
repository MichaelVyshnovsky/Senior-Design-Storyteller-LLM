'''''Inferno''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] for [[druid]]s that set a creature aflame.

==Effects==
When a druid cast this spell, one target creature in close range caught fire, burning them severely, with clothing, hair, items, and even flesh burning ferociously. While sufficiently robust being could resist, mundane, flammable items they held would not. After several seconds, the target or their allies could react and try to extinguish the flames, such as they patting them, rolling on the ground, jumping into water, or using magic, with varying degrees of effectiveness. While the flames died down over the course of half-a-minute, they did not halt, and continued for almost a minute, or longer for more capable casters. 

==Components==
As well as [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]], to cast the spell, a druid needed a glob of [[beeswax]] as a [[material component]].
