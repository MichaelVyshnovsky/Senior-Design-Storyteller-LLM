        "mainbody": "'''''Icy claw''''' was a powerful spell.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell created a large dragon claw, made from ice, in mid-air. The hand had four sharp talons and was about {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in length. It flew through the air at a target with great speed. A targeted creature could not use effects or spells, such as ''[[darkness]]'' or ''[[invisibility]]'', to conceal itself from the claw. ''Icy claw'' was vulnerable to ''[[dispel magic]]'' and ''[[disintegrate]]''. Additionally, the claw could not break through a ''[[wall of force]]'' nor could it enter an ''[[antimagic field]]''. It was also affected by both the ''[[prismatic sphere]]'' and ''[[prismatic wall]]'' spells.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a focus, a claw from a [[white dragon]]."
