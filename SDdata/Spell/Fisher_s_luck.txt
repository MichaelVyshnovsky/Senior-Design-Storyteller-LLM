Fishers luck was a spell unique to Maztica.
When cast, this spell summoned all nearby fish. The fish swarmed to the location of the caster, allowing others to be able to continuously net or spear fish. The caster was unable to participate as they had to maintain concentration on the spell or else it was broken. The spell would not function if there was no fish within the spells area of effect. The spell lasted until the caster broke their concentration or a full day passed.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component some fish scales.
