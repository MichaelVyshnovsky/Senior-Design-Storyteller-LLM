Natural attunement was a divine enchantment spell used by rangers, specialty priests devoted to Gwaeron Windstrom.
This spell allowed the caster to become fully attuned to their environment, picking up every detail and heightening their awareness. Their tracking skills were temporarily increased allowing skilled trackers to even track flying creatures.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a handful of dirt smeared on the casters palms to cast.
