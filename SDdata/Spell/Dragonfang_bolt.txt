Dragonfang bolt was a spell used by many sorcerers who were inexperienced or had not yet obtained a vast amount of power. 
When cast, Dragonfang bolt caused several venomous dragon fangs to appear in mid-air, which the sorcerer could then hurl towards one or two creatures within fifty feet of the caster, inevitably striking them and quite possibly poisoning them. 
The spell was not one that came easily and could only be cast once per day.
