Native item was an Enchantment spell used by wizards
In ages prior to the Spellplague, magical items with "plus" enchantments &ndash most commonly armors, weapons, and cloaks or rings of protection &ndash would lose some of their potency outside of their plane of origin,
When cast, native item artificially restored these levels of enchantment in an item,This side-effect is not mentioned in The Planewalkers Handbook. The chance of this backlash of energy occurring cumulatively increased with each additional effected item that an individual wielded. Additionally, there existed a twenty-percent chance for each such item to disappear, returning to their plane of origin.
This spell took four minutes to cast and lasted for a minimum of ten minutes, with the duration cumulatively growing in increments of ten minutes depending upon how powerful the spellcaster was.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, native item required the spellcaster to rub the desired magical item with a bit of soil or water from its plane of origin, or whatever was the closest equivalent to those substances therein.
Sometime in the 14 century DR, a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff traveling in the 144 Layer of the Abyss came across a race of humans known as the Verlassim. The leader of these people, Baron Tauris, casted native item on one of the belongings of these adventurers in an elaborate ritual. This casting was so powerful that the spells duration lasted for the remainder of their time in that Abyssal layer.
Some time later, a duergar sage living in Acheron by the name of Gheldoin gifted a spellbook containing native item to another group of Ravenian adventurers after they impressed him by deciphering the script on an old scroll that detailed a story about Laduguer.
