        "mainbody": "Pressure resistance was a common spell used by clerics and wizards in Ser√¥s.\nA caster used this spell to increase their or another individuals tolerance to underwater pressure. It allowed the recipient to swim twice as deep than normal, and survive the crushing water pressure found at these depths.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component. Clerics required their holy symbol and wizards required a piece of cartilage from a deep sea creature."
