        "mainbody": "Ghastly hands was a necromancy spell that transformed the spellcasters hands to those of a ghast.\nFor the duration of the spell, the casters mere touch was capable of paralyzation. They emitted a distinct, foul odor that was recognizable to anyone who had previous encountered a ghast.\nThe caster could end the effects of the spell at will, but any paralyzation they caused could not abated, and ran its course.\nThe casting of this spell required verbal and somatic components.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
