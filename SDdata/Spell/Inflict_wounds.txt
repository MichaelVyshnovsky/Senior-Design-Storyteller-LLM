'''''Inflict light wounds''''', also known as '''''cause light wounds''''', was a [[necromancy]] spell that caused light damage to a creature touched by the caster. After the [[Second Sundering]] it was simply called '''''inflict wounds'''''.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, with a touch, the caster channeled [[negative energy]] that did harm to living beings. Conversely, because negative energy powered [[undead]], it healed them to the same degree instead.

The reverse of this spell, ''[[cure light wounds]]'', channeled [[positive energy]] and had the exact opposite effect (healed the living, harmed the undead).

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
