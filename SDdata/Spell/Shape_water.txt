'''''Shape water''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[cantrip]] that manipulated a small volume of water.

==Effects==
The spell could momentarily gently move or alter the course of a water flow for a short period of time. It could also sculpt a volume of water no larger than a cube {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} on a side into animated shapes, change its color or opacity, or even freeze it for up to 1 hour.

The spell could be cast multiple times, but only two long-lasting effects could be simultaneously in effect at any time.

==Components==
The spell only required [[somatic component]]s.
