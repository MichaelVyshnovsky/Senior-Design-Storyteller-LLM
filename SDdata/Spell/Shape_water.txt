Shape water was a transmutation cantrip that manipulated a small volume of water.
The spell could momentarily gently move or alter the course of a water flow for a short period of time. It could also sculpt a volume of water no larger than a cube  on a side into animated shapes, change its color or opacity, or even freeze it for up to 1 hour.
The spell could be cast multiple times, but only two long-lasting effects could be simultaneously in effect at any time.
The spell only required somatic components.
