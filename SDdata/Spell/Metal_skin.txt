Metal skin was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur.
When cast, this spell altered the skin of a creature, causing their skin to become as hard as steel. However, the creatures movement was slowed for the duration of the spell. A creature who had this spell cast on them also became vulnerable to the magnetism spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component a piece of rhinoceros skin, which the wu jen swallowed.
