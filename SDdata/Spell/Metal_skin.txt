'''''Metal skin''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
When cast, this spell altered the skin of a creature, causing their skin to become as hard as steel. However, the creature's movement was slowed for the duration of the spell. A creature who had this spell cast on them also became vulnerable to the ''[[magnetism]]'' spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a piece of [[rhinoceros]] skin, which the wu jen swallowed.
