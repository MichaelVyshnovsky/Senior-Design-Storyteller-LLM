Named for the ancient [[Tyche|goddess of luck]] who was split into [[Tymora]] and [[Beshaba]], '''''Tyche's touch''''' was a divine [[abjuration]] spell that granted either a protection or a curse to the target.

==Effects==
The protection or curse from this spell lasted a day and either aided or harmed the target of the spell as circumstances affected them.

==History==
Presumably this spell was first granted to clerics of [[Tyche]], but in later years divine spell casters of both [[Beshaba]] and [[Tymora]] were granted the spell.
