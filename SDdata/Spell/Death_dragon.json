        "mainbody": "Death dragon was a powerful spell used by evil clerics.\nWhen cast, this spell summoned a power of great evil and encased it within a dragon-shaped cocoon. The shell of the cocoon was made from bones and negative energy. When held by the caster, it projected fear and if the caster touched another creature, the effect was similar to a inflict critical wounds spell. Additionally, while holding the cocoon, the caster was unable to cast a spell that required a focus or somatic or material components.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a divine focus."
