        "mainbody": "'''''Death dragon''''' was a powerful [[spell]] used by evil [[cleric]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell summoned a power of great evil and encased it within a dragon-shaped cocoon. The shell of the cocoon was made from bones and [[negative energy]]. When held by the caster, it projected fear and if the caster touched another creature, the effect was similar to a ''[[inflict critical wounds]]'' spell. Additionally, while holding the cocoon, the caster was unable to cast a spell that required a focus or somatic or material components.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[divine focus]]."
