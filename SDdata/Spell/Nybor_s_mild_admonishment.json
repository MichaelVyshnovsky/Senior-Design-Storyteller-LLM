        "mainbody": "Nybors mild admonishment was an enchantment spell that inflicted an agonizing pain upon its target, rendering them completely incapacitated.\nWhen struck by mild admonishment, a target experienced such intense pain that they were incapable of doing anything but writhe upon the ground in agony. However, some people were capable of completely resisting the spells effects.\nLike Nybors gentle reminder, this spell was commonly used by slavers, overseers and other Red Wizards of Thay who administered over their subjugates.\nThe casting of gentle reminder required only verbal and somatic components,"
