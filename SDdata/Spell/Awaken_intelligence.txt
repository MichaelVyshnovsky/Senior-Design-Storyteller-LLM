Awaken intelligence was an arcane alteration spell that imbued a creature of animal intelligence with sapience.
The process was painful for the target and could result in their death. If the target survived they would possess sapience for the rest of their life. The intelligence could even be passed to their offspring if it was "locked in" with the alter beast spell. The spell was physically draining for the caster as well, resulting in a decrease in their spellcasting ability for one full day while they recovered.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a dried fish and a piece of brain coral to cast. A full wizards laboratory was also needed for all of the spells preparations.
Hssthak, a sarrukh mummy, carried a Nether Scroll with the awaken intelligence spell.
