'''''Awaken intelligence''''' was an [[arcane magic|arcane]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that imbued a creature of animal intelligence with sapience.

==Effects==
The process was painful for the target and could result in their death. If the target survived they would possess sapience for the rest of their life. The intelligence could even be passed to their offspring if it was "locked in" with the ''[[alter beast]]'' spell. The spell was physically draining for the caster as well, resulting in a decrease in their spellcasting ability for one full day while they recovered.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a dried [[fish]] and a piece of [[brain coral]] to cast. A full wizard's laboratory was also needed for all of the spell's preparations.

==History==
[[Hssthak]], a [[sarrukh]] [[mummy]], carried a [[Nether Scrolls|Nether Scroll]] with the ''awaken intelligence'' spell.
