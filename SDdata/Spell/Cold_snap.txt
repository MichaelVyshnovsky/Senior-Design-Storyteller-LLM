Cold snap was a divine magic spell available to priests of Auril, the Frostmaiden. It caused a dramatic drop in temperature over a wide area that lasted for hours.
For a cleric casting this spell, the area of effect was a circle, centered on the caster, with a radius of one mile (1.6 kilometers) and the duration varied from two to eight hours. For a druid casting this spell, the radius was two miles (3.2 kilometers) and the duration varied from four to sixteen hours. The casting time was only one minute.
When cast, this spell lowered the temperature in the affected area by 5° F (about 2.8° C) per level of the caster, up to a maximum change of 50° F (about 28° C), but not below −20° F (−29° C). If the temperature dropped below 30° F (−1° C), fragile plants and fruit crops could be damaged with prolonged exposure (three or more hours). If the temperature dropped below 0° F (−18° C), unprotected individuals were severely challenged to avoid hypothermia and/or frostbite, eventually falling unconscious and freezing to death. Those wearing winter clothing could last much longer before succumbing to the cold. If the temperature hit the maximum low of −20° F (−29° C), even well-dressed individuals were on the verge of freezing to death in a relatively short time.
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.
This spell was believed to be recorded in a holy book of Auril called Revelations of the Icedawn and was only granted to her clerical and druidic followers.
