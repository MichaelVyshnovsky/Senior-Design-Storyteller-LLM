Draconic transformation was a spell used by druids, sorcerers, and wizards to give themselves dragon-like features. 
This spell transformed its caster so that they gained dragon-like traits. They gained the ability to see in total darkness and detect invisible things, to breathe out a blast of energy, and to conjure incorporeal wings for flight. 
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was a statuette of a dragon worth at least 500 gp
