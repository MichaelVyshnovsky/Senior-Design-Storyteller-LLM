'''''A Wild Ride''''' is a gamebook in the [[Endless Quest]] series that focused on the [[Spelljammer: AD&D Adventures in Space|Spelljammer]] setting, specifically the [[Rock of Bral]] in [[Realmspace]].

{{Quote|'''Save the Rock!'''

Jaxom Star has a reputation as a daredevil. In a rickety old skiff, he sails the most perilous regions of Wildspace, scavenging for items to sell in his grandfather's junk booth on the Rock of Bral. Most citizens of that asteroid city consider him a loon. If only they would respect him as a person.

Then, one day, a strange and deadly sea of asteroids threatens the Rock of Bral. It falls to Jaxom to lead the heroes Dare, Keela, Deathmark, and Greenthorne through a maze of perils to end the threat, and in so doing, to win for himself respect as a hero of the Rock.

Only your choice can help you survive '''A Wild Ride'''.
