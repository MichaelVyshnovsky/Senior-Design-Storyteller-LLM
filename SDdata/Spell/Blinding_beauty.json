        "mainbody": "'''''Blinding beauty''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that made the caster as beautiful as a [[nymph]], allowing them to blind humanoids that gazed upon them.",
        "Effect": "The caster acquired a nymph's supernatural physical beauty for about forty-two seconds, or longer for more capable casters. Any [[humanoid]] within 60 feet (18 meters) who saw him or her directly risked being permanently blinded, similar to the ''[[blindness]]'' spell, if they could lack the fortitude to resist. However, the caster could quickly and easily suppress the blinding effect if he or she so desired, while staying just as beautiful.",
        "Component": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, the caster required to practice abstinence, by abstaining from sex for one week before casting."
