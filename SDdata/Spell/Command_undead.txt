Command undead was a necromancy spell that allowed a wizard to gain control over a number of undead creatures.
In a manner similar to the divine power available to evil-aligned priests, command undead granted the caster an attempt to gain dominion over a number of undead. If they failed the attempt, the spell was useless, if they succeeded they could direct and command between 2-12 undead minions for just over an hour.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
