'''''Command undead''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[wizard]] to gain control over a number of [[undead]] creatures.

==Effects==
In a manner similar to the [[divine]] [[power]] available to [[evil]]-aligned [[priest]]s, ''command undead'' granted the caster an attempt to gain dominion over a number of undead. If they failed the attempt, the spell was useless, if they succeeded they could direct and command between 2-12 undead minions for just over an hour.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.

==History==
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
