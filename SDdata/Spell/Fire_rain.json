        "mainbody": "Fire rain was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nUpon casting, streams of magical fire fell from the sky over a target area of 30 square feet (2.8 square meters). Buildings or cover such as rock outcroppings were strong enough to protect a creature from the spell. Structures or items composed of combustible material were at risk of catching fire. The spell could only be cast out-of-doors.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components. The wu jen blew a small amount of lamp-oil through a small pipe."
