        "mainbody": "'''''Fire rain''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "Upon casting, streams of magical fire fell from the sky over a target area of 30 square feet (2.8 square meters). Buildings or cover such as rock outcroppings were strong enough to protect a creature from the spell. Structures or items composed of combustible material were at risk of catching fire. The spell could only be cast out-of-doors.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s. The wu jen blew a small amount of lamp-oil through a small pipe."
