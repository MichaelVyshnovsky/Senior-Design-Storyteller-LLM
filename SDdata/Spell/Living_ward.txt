'''''Living ward''''' was a [[spell]] commonly used by evil [[cleric]]s on the [[Domains of Dread]].

==Effects==
This spell was the reverse of ''[[undead ward]]''. When cast, this spell created a zone in which a living individual was unable to enter. The zone was cube-shaped, with a minimum length of {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} per side, which increased with the caster's skill level. Animals and monsters were able to pass through the zone with no issue. If a living individual was within the area of effect when the spell was cast, they were unaffected. However, if they left the area of effect, they were unable to return within. The spell was often used by [[undead]] sentient creatures.

==Components==
This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components.
