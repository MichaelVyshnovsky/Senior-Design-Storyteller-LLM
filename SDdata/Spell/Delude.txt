'''''Delude''''' was an [[arcane magic|arcane]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that concealed the caster's true nature from others.

==Effects==
''Delude'' concealed the caster's true nature from anyone within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} when the spell was cast. Those under the influence of the spell's magic could not discern, by mundane or magical means, if the caster was pure of heart or wicked. If magical means such as ''[[know alignment]]'' were used on the caster, then the assumed alignment was detected by the spell and not the caster's true nature.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.

==History==
[[Deceiver genie]]s in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate, used the ''delude'' spell.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Monstrous Compendium Pages}}
