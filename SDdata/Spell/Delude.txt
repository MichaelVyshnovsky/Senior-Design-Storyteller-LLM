Delude was an arcane alteration spell that concealed the casters true nature from others.
Delude concealed the casters true nature from anyone within  when the spell was cast. Those under the influence of the spells magic could not discern, by mundane or magical means, if the caster was pure of heart or wicked. If magical means such as know alignment were used on the caster, then the assumed alignment was detected by the spell and not the casters true nature.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
Deceiver genies in Zakhara, the Land of Fate, used the delude spell.
