        "mainbody": "Moderate word of nurturing was an utterance from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind that used truespeak to rejuvenate a target from its wounds, or to rend them apart, if reversed.\nIn its normal form, healing energy suffused the target, slowly repairing them of a great amount of damage. In its reversed form, it rended and tore at the targets being, dealing severe wounds. It could last for an instant, but with some concentration, damage would be doubled after a few seconds.\nThe utterance was known to painspeakers, who used only the reversed form, and to loquasphinxes."
