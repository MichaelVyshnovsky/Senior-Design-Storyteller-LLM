        "mainbody": "Choke was an arcane spell from the schools of necromancy and conjuration that allowed a wizard to asphyxiate a target.\nThis spell created a pair of ghostly hands that strangled a single target provided they were roughly humanoid in shape and smaller than an ogre. The hands would continue to choke the victim for the spells duration, which was based upon the casters skill. The hands could not be physically removed from the targets neck, but the spell could be dispelled.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a handkerchief or small piece of cloth to cast. The cloth was tied into a know during the casting.\nThis spell was found within the Book of Shadows, a tome based upon the oration of the necromancer Nebt Bhakau of Zakhara."
