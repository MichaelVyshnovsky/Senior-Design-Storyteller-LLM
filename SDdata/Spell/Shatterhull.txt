Shatterhull was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell considerably weakened any structure submerged in water. It was commonly used on ships at sea. This spell could create a gaping hole in the side of a ship or just several leaks depending on the inherent strength of the wood.
Spelljammers were generally safe from the effects of this spell, as they traveled through the phlogiston rather than water.
This spell required a thin glass needle to cast.
