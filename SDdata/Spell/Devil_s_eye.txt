Devils eye was a divination spell that gave the caster a devils eyesight.
On casting devils eye, the casters eyes gained the eyesight of a devil. However, it was a downgraded version of it. This spells recipient could see through normal darkness, but only to a range of 30 ft (9.14 m) through magical darkness.
The casting of devils eye required somatic and verbal components.
