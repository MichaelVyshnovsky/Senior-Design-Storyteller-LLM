        "mainbody": "'''''Sharess's caress''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that overwhelmed an evil creature with powerful feelings of good.<ref group=\"note\">This spell is actually named ''Lastai's caress'', but Lastai is not a ''Forgotten Realms'' goddess. Instead, the ''Player's Guide to Faer√ªn'' stats that Lastai is equivalent to Sharess. Thus the name was changed for the wiki.",
        "Effect": "With but a gentle touch, the caster filled an evil creature with intense feelings of compassion, love, and other pleasant feelings, which disturbed and weakened them. Overcome and struggling, the target was left either shaken, frightened, cowering, or sickened, or just shaken if the caster was lenient.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s and a peach seed as a [[material component]]. The caster had to know the target was evil, else it would not work."
