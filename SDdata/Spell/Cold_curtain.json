        "mainbody": "Cold curtain was a powerful arcane necromancy spell that warded portals with deadly magic.\nWhen cast upon any portal, cold curtain would attack any creature passing through who did not speak the proper pass phrase with energy drain magic. Casting this spell upon a portal would noticeable lower the temperature in the general area. Targets caught within the portal would continue to suffer the ill effects of the energy drain for as long as they remained in the area.\nWhen casting this spell the caster could choose whether they wanted the warding magic of the spell to be visible or not on the portal.\nThis spell required only verbal components to cast.\nThis was a rare spell used only by dragons in Faer√ªn."
