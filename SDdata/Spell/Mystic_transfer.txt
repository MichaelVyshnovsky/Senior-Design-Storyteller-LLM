Mystic transfer was an evocation spell that allowed the caster to receive the effect of a cast spell from another priest of the same religion and redirect it, thus greatly extending the range of the transferred spell.
Mystic transfer took one minute to cast and for the next nine minutes the caster could be the target of spells from one or more priests of the same religion. Instead of experiencing the effects of a spell, mystic transfer channeled the spell into the receiver who could then immediately pick a new target. If the new target was another priest with an active mystic transfer aura, then that priest received the spell, and so on in rapid bucket-brigade fashion until the last priest chose a normal target. The effect of the transferred spell was as if the original caster was standing at the end of the chain, i.e., if a 10th-level priest cast flame strike  away at a 3rd-level priest wrapped in mystic transfer, the 3rd-level priest could then direct the flame strike at any target within  and it would hit as if cast by a 10th-level priest. The receiving priest had to be within the maximum range of the original caster and be specifically targeted by the original caster&mdasha priest using mystic transfer could not intercept a spell that did not target him or her.
The caster of mystic transfer did not have to concentrate to keep it active but could not perform any significant tasks while receiving or transferring spells.
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.
