Inside this volume, the prevailing weather conditions remained constant regardless of changes in the surrounding area. Normal or magical changes in the weather did not occur within the protected area, even with the rising or setting of the sun.\nA drop of rain was required to cast this spell, along with verbal and somatic components and the priests holy symbol."
