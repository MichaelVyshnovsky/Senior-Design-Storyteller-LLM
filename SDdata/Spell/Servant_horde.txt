Servant horde was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, this spell created several invisible servants. These servants were often used by wu jen to aid in manual labor. For example, a kind wu jen used this spell to help a village sow or harvest their crops. This spell was similar to unseen servant. The spells duration was determined by the wu jens skill level, a powerful wu jens spell lasted up to four hours.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small stick wrapped in knotted string.
