'''''Servant horde''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created several invisible servants. These servants were often used by wu jen to aid in manual labor. For example, a kind wu jen used this spell to help a village sow or harvest their crops. This spell was similar to ''[[unseen servant]]''. The spell's duration was determined by the wu jen's skill level, a powerful wu jen's spell lasted up to four hours.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a small stick wrapped in knotted string.
