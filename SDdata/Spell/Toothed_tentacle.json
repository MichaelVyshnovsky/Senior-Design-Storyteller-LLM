        "mainbody": "Toothed tentacle was a spell that was first developed by the phaerimms.\nWhen cast, the spell caused a tentacle of whirling energy to appear at the hand of the caster. It then split into three smaller tentacles with mouths at the tips. These mouths were filled with razor sharp teeth.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, hair and three teeth from any creature.\nThis spell was originally created by the Phaerimm of Myth Drannor."
