        "mainbody": "Amaunators uncertainty was an Amaunatori spell.\nAmaunators uncertainty instilled a strong sense of uncertainty in the target. This uncertainty prevented the victim from executing whatever action he or she intended to in a non-hostile situation while it merely delayed a persons readiness to enter combat in a combative situation.\nThe spell could take multiple targets and leaving the area in which they were affected did nothing to shake off the uncertainty. Only waiting until the spell expired helped.\nAmaunators uncertainty required verbal and material components, the latter being a fragment of a turtle shell."
