        "mainbody": "Firbolgs (|audio=Firbolg.ogg) were a reclusive race of giant-kin who preferred to avoid contact with other sentient races. They were both the most intelligent\nFirbolgs resembled humans, and the males would sport great, thick beards. Their thick, tough skin was fleshy pink, and their hair, though it came in many colors, was usually either red or blond and worn long. A firbolgs voice was deep and smooth, and they tended to roll their consonants when speaking.\nFirbolgs were typically over  tall,Volos Guide to Monsters strangely lists a firbolgs height as  and gives them a weight of . Perhaps Volo only encountered firbolgs who had taken a shorter stature with their innate magic.\nThe firbolgs of the Moonshae Isles were said to be considerably ugly.\nThe average firbolg was stronger than a forest bear. or smaller. They sometimes used this magical power to blend in or interact with smaller races.\nThey had excellent vision at night and could perhaps see in the dark. Some sages claimed that firbolgs had regenerative abilities. Other sages reported that firbolgs could make themselves turn invisible. They were also said to be able to communicate to a limited effect with both plants and animals of their forest homes.\nthumb|250px|left|Tavis Burdun, King of Hartsvale.\nFirbolgs enjoyed quiet time in the woods, in harmony with nature. The forests were sacred to them and symbolized the heart of the earth and the adaptability of life. They saw themselves as the forests caretakers.\nWhile firbolgs of other worlds may have had tendencies toward a variety of alignments, those of Faerûn were usually lawful good in alignment,) creatures by other giants,\nFirbolgs considered greed to be one of the worst vices. They believed that one should only ever take what one needs and no more. They saw no value in material wealth such as gems and gold, but sometimes would find prankish ways of taking valuables from strangers, out of a sense of fun.\nFirbolgs believed that charity was a virtue but also believed that it was harmful for the recipient to know the identity of the provider because of this they appeared to be reclusive amongst the other races, although they were very sociable with established friends. They were extremely honest and could not lie without feeling physical discomfort, even if the lie was by omission.\nFirbolgs tended to be over-confident and fearless, except for a pervasive phobia of humanoid mobs. They saw the wearing of armor as cowardly, and thus did not usually wear armor, nor did they carry shields.\nFirbolgs were cautious and shrewd in their dealings with outsiders. They distrusted most humans and demihumans. Among non-giants, they were neutral with druids, elves, and fey. They were on good terms with storm giants, whom they looked up to and tried to emulate, but they avoided other giant races, and actively fought against the other giant-kin.\nIf provoked, firbolgs were formidable opponents, skilled both in physical combat and druidic magics. They preferred massive weapons, such as two-handed swords and halberds. They were strong enough to wield most human-made weapons in a single hand.\nIn battle, firbolgs fought tactically and relied on teamwork. They were adept at batting away or catching projectiles, and had excellent throwing arms, like any giant did. They could easily toss a large rock weighing around .\nFirbolgs had a family-centered, clan-based society. They lived in settlements in remote hilly or forested areas. Their settlements were strongholds, including wooden structures, built from the trees around them, with defensive towers with catwalks between them. Rarely, they inhabited cavern complexes dug into the hillsides. They used their magic to ensure that their homes remained a secret to outsiders. These clan settlements were small, with between about four and sixteen members, often with a shaman or druid, and lived separate from each other. A few firbolg clans were nomadic.\nA typical firbolg home was a huge one-story log building with strong walls. A large fireplace with multiple openings warmed a central common room.\nAs caretakers of the woods, they carefully and resourcefully lived off the land, making sure to ensure balance. During summer, they stored excess nuts, fruits, and berries, so that they could provide food to the forest animals during winter. Although they did farm, it was only to supplement their diets they preferred a more hunter-gatherer lifestyle, rather than the brigand/raider lifestyle of many other giants. Their hunting grounds were usually spread out in a  radius from their clan homes. They ate small portions of meat with most meals, and reserved large roasts of meat for special celebrations.\nMost firbolg tribes preferred isolation from other races, avoiding their politics and struggles. If intruders entered their territory, they would usually try an indirect approach at causing the \"invaders\" to leave&mdashdriving game away to discourage hunters or redirecting streams or forest trails to confuse parties. If these methods failed, the firbolgs would at last confront the outsiders. If the outsiders seemed peaceful, the firbolgs would peacefully ask them to leave if the outsiders seemed evil or seemed to have no concern for the forest lands, the firbolgs might mount a devastating attack. On occasion, they would trade with peaceful folk living nearby in exchange for providing services utilizing their great strength.\nFirbolg adventurers were rare and most often were individuals separated from their tribes&mdashorphans, exiles, lone survivors, or the like. A few adventured to gain knowledge.\nFirbolgs seemed to have a natural tendency toward druidic magics, and many of their chieftains were thus druids. Others became rangers or fighters. Other adventuring vocations were rare firbolg monks were completely unknown. About five percent of firbolgs encountered were shamans.\nFirbolg communities were known to rally around individuals who contracted lycanthropy, rather than shun them, using all resources at their disposal to help the afflicted find a cure.\nThe firbolgs had rejected the ordning, the customary social order amongst giants and giant-kin, and preferred to exercise free will by using a system called \"the code\". This was conceived in ancient times, although its exact origins had been lost, but the exact implementation varied from one community to the next. It promoted the idea that the society was the most important aspect and superseded the individual. Actions were more important than relatives or heritage. If \"the code\" was breached, a firbolg might be enslaved within their own tribe For every decision made, they considered the effects on the forest and the rest of the natural world. During a famine, they would rather go hungry themselves than strain the land.\nFirbolgs had a rough form of democracy known as \"the cast\". This involved summoning all the firbolgs in a tribe who then would cast their vote on an issue by using a rune-engraved stone. The actual \"casting\" of votes varied from clan to clan. In some cases, it involved literally tossing the stones. At one firbolg settlement in the Cold Mountains, they had built an enormous scale and set their votes in the appropriate weighing pan.\nExile was often used as a form of punishment for an unforgivable act, such as killing a rare or beautiful animal or starting a forest fire. An outcast firbolg was never permitted to return home.\nNearby clans would gather once a year at the fall solstice at an enclave to settle any disputes among the clans. Shamans would preside over such events, which often simply were a time of celebration.\nthumb|250px|right|Grond Peaksmasher, patron demigod of the firbolgs of the Moonshae Isles.\nIn general, firbolgs admired the goddess Iallanis. However, the firbolgs of the Moonshae Isles were an exception to this. They worshiped the demigod Grond Peaksmasher, thought by religious scholars to be the son of Hiatea. the firbolgs of the Moonshaes believed that Grond carved them from stone and that the dwarves were the result of the \"leftovers\" of this process.\nOn the Moonshaes, the worship of Grond was originally led by shamans, but after Gronds reawakening, priests became active. Gronds priests were allied with the druids of the Earthmother. \nFirbolgs had their own tongue,\nFirbolg pregnancies were typically about two years long. This was much longer than other giant-kin, who had pregnancies roughly equivalent to humans. Firbolgs reached adulthood at about 30 years, and could live as many as 500 years.\nFirbolgs consumed about twice as much as a human to survive.\nFirbolgs were known to be highly susceptible to almost all forms of lycanthropy, though somehow immune to being afflicted with the wereraven form of the condition.\nThe firbolg race was created when Othea, wife of the giant deity Annam All-Father, had an affair with Ulutiu.\nLike all the giant-kin races, the firbolgs were never granted a portion land by Annam from which to found their own \"dynasty\" inside the kingdom of Ostoria. They were initially welcomed by their fellow giants and learned their ways, but once their true parentage had been discovered by Annam he cast them out. They became excluded from the societies of true giants, despite Otheas best efforts to protect them.\nIn -5000 DR, in a great conflict with the lands dwarves, Grond Peaksmasher was imprisoned on Omans Isle beneath the great Ice Peak. Without his guidance, the firbolgs of the Moonshae Isles over time degenerated into a barbaric culture little better than that of hill giants, engaging in violent raids against the humans of the islands.\nIn -2000 DR, a race of giants known as the fomorians were brought to the Moonshae Isles by the Beasts master, and they overpowered the native firbolg tribes, taking them as slaves. After a couple generations of forced breeding, the firbolgs of the Moonshae Isles began to assume some of the same disfigurements commonly associated with fomorians.\nIn 1365 DR, the firbolgs managed to awaken their patron god Grond Peaksmasher with the aid of Deirdre Kendrick. Grond then sought to elevate the firbolgs back to their full potential and culture. At this time, many of the firbolgs of the Isles began migrating to Omans Isle to live in isolation from the other races.\n* Tavis Burdun\n* Galgadayle\n* Morten\n* Orvis Torval, a member of the City Watch of Waterdeep.\n* Raeyadfourne\n* Vander\n* Meadowhome\n* Helligbror\n* Kappebror\n* Kriggabror"
