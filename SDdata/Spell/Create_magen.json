        "mainbody": "Create magen was a powerful spell which allowed the caster to create a magen.\nWhen successfully cast, this spell created one of the subspecies of magen. The kind of magen was chosen by the caster during casting. The magen was totally loyal to the caster and obeyed any command.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required several expensive material components. To use this spell, the caster had to use a full-size doll, stuffed with ashes or dust,  in the semblance of a human, a vial of quicksilver worth at least 500 gp, and a rod made from crystal that was worth at least 1,500 gp.  The process of casting the spell consumed both the quicksilver and the doll. \nThe caster placed the vial of quicksilver onto the chest of the doll. The caster then sewed up the seams of the doll and began casting the spell. The final part of the spell was touching the doll with the rod of crystal. If cast properly, the doll transformed into the selected magen, dressed in whatever clothing was on the doll."
