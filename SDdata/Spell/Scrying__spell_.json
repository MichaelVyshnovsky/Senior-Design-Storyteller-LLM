        "mainbody": "'''''Scrying''''' was both an [[arcane magic|arcane]] and [[divine magic]] spell that allowed the caster to view a subject at great distance and possibly across the [[planes]] of existence. The effect was very similar to using a ''[[crystal ball]]'' but with differences in scope, duration, and components. Newer versions of this spell allowed the caster to hear as well as see the subject.\n\n[[Cleric]]s received a similar spell they called '''''magic font''''' because it used a basin of ''[[holy water]]'' as the scrying surface. [[Druid]]s (and some clerics) had a more limited version they called ''[[reflecting pool]]'' for the same reason.",
        "Effects": {
            "Sensory organ": "The later ''scrying'' spells worked by creating a sensory organ that was an adjunct of the caster's sight and, if the spell allowed, hearing, even if the caster was visually or hearing impaired. (This was a great improvement over previous versions that required the caster to be able to view a reflective surface.) Thus, any enhancements to the caster's senses, such as ''[[Darkvision (spell)|darkvision]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', and ''[[read magic]]'', operated through the scrying. If the subject was a location, then this sensor was stationary at that location, otherwise it followed the subject for the duration of the spell.",
            "Casting spells through scrying": "All but the newest version of this spell allowed a limited set of other spells to be cast through the scrying device or the connection to the sensory organ and operate at the observed location. The higher the level of the caster, the better the chance that these spells would succeed. Over the ages, the spells that could be attempted through a ''scrying'' were: ''[[detect chaos]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect illusion]]'', ''[[detect law]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', and ''[[message]]''."
        },
        "Detection and thwarting": "For the earliest versions of this spell, creatures that had sufficient intelligence had a small chance every minute to notice they were being observed. This chance increased with intelligence and experience level. A later version simplified this to the same chance for all beings with average or better intelligence. For the newest version, creatures that could see invisible objects could see the sensor as a floating orb about the size of a human fist. Once detected, the sensor could be dispelled by ''[[dispel magic]]''.\n\n''Scrying'' was blocked by ''[[antimagic field]]'', sheets of [[Wikipedia:en:Lead|lead]], ''[[mind blank]]'', and ''[[nondetection]]''. a ''[[weirdstone]]'', and even the [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious gemstone]] [[tchazar]] caused ''scrying'' to be blurred within a two-foot (sixty-centimeter) radius.\n\nWhen ''scrying'' was used on the same individual or object by several ''scryers'' simultaneously, they were able to easily detect that fact by visible swirling rainbow hues around the target of the spell. This exposed the casters to being detected and tracked by magical means themselves.",
        "Components": "The earliest versions of the ''scrying'' spell were called ''magic mirror'' when cast by a [[wizard]] or [[illusionist]] and required a finely crafted and highly polished [[silver]] mirror costing no less then 1,000 [[gp]]. In addition to verbal and somatic components, samples of [[copper]], [[Wikipedia:en:zinc|zinc]], and [[aqua fortis|nitric acid]] were required, along with the eye of an [[eagle]], [[hawk]], or [[roc]]. All but the mirror were consumed in the casting. The divine version was called ''magic font'' and required a basin that held [[holy water|holy]] or unholy water (depending on the alignment of the caster). The more holy/unholy water in the basin, the longer the scrying lasted. Nothing was consumed in the casting of ''magic font''.\n\nWhen the sensory organ version was first developed, the only additional requirements were that the mirror have dimensions at least two feet by four feet (60 by 120 centimeters) and the holy/unholy water font cost at least 100 gp. Druids were able to use just a natural pool of water. Mirrors, fonts, and pools were not consumed in the casting.\n\nFor the latest version of this spell, all that was required beyond verbal and somatic components was a focus costing at least 1,000 gp, such as a ''crystal ball'', a silver mirror, or a font of holy/unholy water&mdash;no more metals, acids, or eyes.",
        "History": "This spell has been known by many names throughout history. It was originally invented by the [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[archwizard]] [[Anglin]] of [[Seventon]] because it changed an ordinary mirror into a [[scrying]] device. Over time, Anglin's name was dropped and this spell became known as '''''magic mirror'''''. \n\nIn [[1362 DR]] [[Maligor]], the Zulkir of Alteration from [[Thay]] was able to cast a version of Scrying spell using dried flower petals as a component, crushing them into a filled marble bath to spy on [[Brenna Graycloak]]."
