        "mainbody": "Alter beast was a powerful arcane alteration spell that permanently changed a physical aspect of a creature.\nA creatures anatomy could be modified with this spell through an incredibly painful and detailed process. The subject was unconscious and restrained for the casting. Any changes made with alter beast could be passed to the creatures offspring.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component two strands of gold wire twisted together to cast. A full wizards laboratoy was also needed for all of the spells preparations.\nHssthak, a sarrukh mummy, carried a Nether Scroll with the alter beast spell."
