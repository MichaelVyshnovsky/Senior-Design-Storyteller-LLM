'''''Ice axe''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to [[cleric]]s of [[Auril]], the Frostmaiden. It created a whirling cloud of ice slivers shaped like a [[battleaxe]] that the caster could wield with proficiency.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell produced a magical battleaxe made from swirling slivers of ice that appeared in the caster's hand. For the next five minutes (longer for more experienced casters) it could be wielded as if the caster were proficient with this type of weapon. The strength of the caster was not important because the ''ice axe'' was magical and nearly weightless. On a successful hit, the ''ice axe'' did both slashing damage as per a battleaxe, and potentially greater damage by magical coldness.

While the caster held the ''ice axe'', he or she could not be disarmed of the weapon and it could not be physically damaged. If the caster used the axe hand for some other purpose, like holding another object or grappling with an opponent, the ''ice axe'' disappeared until the hand was empty and ready to wield it again. This spell lasted until dismissed by the caster or the duration expired, whichever came first.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a shard of ice, glass, or [[rock crystal|crystal]] to cast.

==History==
This spell was believed to be recorded in a holy book of Auril called ''[[Revelations of the Icedawn]]''{{Cite dragon/312/Faiths of Faerun: Prayers of the Frostmaiden|62}} and was only granted to her clerical followers.
