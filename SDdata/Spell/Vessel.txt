Vessel was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
This spell allowed a wu jen to create a seaworthy ship using a single sheet of paper. To cast the spell, the wu jen was required to be proficient in origami. During casting, the wu jen folded the sheet of paper into a small junk. After they placed the miniature paper junk into water and blew on it, the spell was cast and a full-sized vessel was created. The size of the vessel was determined by the wu jens skill level. On average, the vessel was able to transport the wu jen and four medium-sized humanoids. The vessel required no crew, it moved under its own power. Once the spell was complete, the ship shrank and returned to its paper form.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, namely the sheet of paper.
