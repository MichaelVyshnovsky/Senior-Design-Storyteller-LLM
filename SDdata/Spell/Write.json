        "mainbody": "Write was an evocation spell used by wizards.\nThis useful spell allowed a wizard to inscribe a spell that they were not able to understand in order to study later as they developed their magical craft. Though useful, this spell was not without its risks and the caster would be harmed in both body and psyche by the inscribing process if they erred. More powerful spells caused more harm if the caster failed.\nTranscribing an unknown spell in this manner was a tedious process that put the caster in a trance-like state. Needless to say, they were extremely vulnerable during this time.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, as well as a writing surface, this spell required a fine ink worth at least 200 gp per bottle to cast."
