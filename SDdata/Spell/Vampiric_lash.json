        "mainbody": "Vampiric lash was a spell that was first developed by the phaerimms.\nThis spell was identical to forcelash but more powerful. When cast, a long whip of energy was created at the end of the casters arm or other limb chosen during casting. This powerful whip was controlled by the casters willpower and was able to attack a target within  of the caster. The whip was strong enough to penetrate most barrier or protection spells like shield. When struck, the targeted creature became immobile and was wracked with painful spasms as energy coursed through their body. In addition, the spell slowly drained the life force of the targeted creature.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components in the form of hair and three teeth from any creature.\nThis spell was originally created by the phaerimms of Myth Drannor."
