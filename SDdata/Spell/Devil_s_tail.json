        "mainbody": "Devils tail was a transmutation spell that gave the caster a tail.\nOn casting devils tail, a tail grew from the casters body. This black or red 3-foot-long (91.44 cm) tail was spiked at the end. This tails value lay in its potential as a weapon. The caster had it so well under control that it could be employed as a weapon even in conjunction with other hand-held ones. However, doing such a thing was detrimental to the accuracy of the attacks. The spell had a minimum duration of an entire minute and lasted longer the stronger the caster was.\nThe casting of devils tail required somatic and verbal components.\nThe only known way to obtain devils tail was through the Diabolic domain, a suit of spells that was not granted by all infernal entities."
