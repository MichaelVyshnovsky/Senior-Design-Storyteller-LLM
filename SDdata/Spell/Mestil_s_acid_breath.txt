'''Mestil's acid breath''' was an arcane [[spell]] of the [[conjuration]] [[school of magic]] practiced by [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerers]] after the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.

==Effects==
The caster breathed out [[acid]] in the form of a cone of droplets to a distance of at least 30 feet (9.1 meters), burning all caught within who could not avoid it. It increased in range and potency with the prowess of the caster.

==Components==
It required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The latter was a handful of fire ants, whether dead or living.
