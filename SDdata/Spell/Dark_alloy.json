        "mainbody": "Dark alloy was a forge chant employed in the making of dark steel items by dwarves.\nThe spell transformed iron into a metal with unusual properties, which became invisible in sunlight and glowed in darkness. The dwarves of Faer√ªn called it dark steel, and often used it in weapon filigree or in the making of runes for shrines.\nBesides the chanting common to all forge chants, it required an ounce of mithral.The spells requirements are cut off. It is possible that more than an ounce of mithral was called for, or that the ounce was per ounce of dark steel."
