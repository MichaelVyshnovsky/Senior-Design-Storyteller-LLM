        "mainbody": "'''''Dark alloy''''' was a [[forge chant]] employed in the making of [[dark steel]] items by [[dwarves]].",
        "Effects": "The spell transformed iron into a metal with unusual properties, which became invisible in sunlight and glowed in darkness. The dwarves of [[Faer√ªn]] called it [[dark steel]], and often used it in weapon filigree or in the making of runes for shrines.",
        "Components": "Besides the chanting common to all [[forge chant]]s, it required an ounce of [[mithral]].The spell's requirements are cut off. It is possible that more than an ounce of mithral was called for, or that the ounce was per ounce of dark steel."
