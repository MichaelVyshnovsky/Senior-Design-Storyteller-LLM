'''''Miracle''''' was an [[evocation]] spell that called upon a [[deity]] to intercede.

==Effects==
At its most basic, the divine intercession took form of a weaker [[cleric]] [[spell]] than ''miracle'' was, an even weaker non-cleric spell, curing another person of a [[magic]]al ailment like being under a ''[[feeblemind]]'' or ''[[insanity]]'' spell, or something comparable to the aforementioned three.

By charging one's essence into the ''miracle'' spell, the deity interceded in a more dramatic fashion like sparing a community from a natural calamity or the like.

The souls of [[Heresy|heretic]]s were treated like the [[False]] by [[Kelemvor]]. A ''miracle''-spell was a means by which this soul could be brought to its proper destination, to be more precise, it was a means by which the deity with the claim on the soul was made to do something about it.

==Components==
A ''miracle'' spell required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s. Even when the aforementioned method of charging the spell with one's essence was not taken, when a spell that drained essence from somebody was duplicated, ''miracle'' drained the necessary essence from the caster.

==History==
Being able to cast ''miracle'' and doing this in ways that could not be reproduced by witnesses made someone a more good religious leader in the eyes of people.
