Watchware, 30 radius was an arcane evocation spell that was an improvement over the basic watchware spell.
When placed upon a fixed location, the magic of this spell extended for  in every direction, alerting the caster to anything entering that area.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a spider web, a small bell made from brass or silver, and a pinch of powdered glass to cast.
This was a rare spell in Faer√ªn.
