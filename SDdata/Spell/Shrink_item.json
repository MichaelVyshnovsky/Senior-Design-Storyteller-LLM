        "mainbody": "'''''Shrink item''''' (originally called '''''Aksa's object''''') was a common [[transmutation]] spell used by [[arcane]] casters to shrink an object to tiny size.",
        "Effects": "Upon casting the spell, the caster could touch a non-magical, non-living object and shrink it to as little as {{Frac|1|4,000}} times its original volume and mass. It would remain in this shrunken state for at least five days&mdash;or longer for more powerful casters.\n\nIf desired, the caster could chose to change the physical make-up of the item, making it behave as if it were made of cloth.\n\nTossing a magically shrunken object onto any hard surface would cause it to revert back to its original size and composition, as would speaking a special command word chosen by the caster. This would end the spell.\n\nEven non-solid objects could be shrunken and changed by ''shrink item'', such as a burning campfire, including its flame. If the spellcaster knew the ''[[permanency]]'' spell, an item could be created that could be shrunk and expanded indefinitely.",
        "Components": "Only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were required to cast this spell.",
        "History": "The spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Aksa]] the Destroyer in {{Yearlink|-2141}}.",
        "Notable Users": "The [[vremyonni]] [[wizard|mage]] [[Bastun]] was known to use this spell."
