'''''Bone blade''''' was a [[spell]] that conjured a [[blade]]d weapon, made out of bone, that could be wielded by the caster or any of their allies.

==Effects==
The blade produced was considered a [[magic]]al weapon that was particularly destructive towards the [[undead]] and could even destroy them outright. The blade was unbreakable until the spell's duration ended, whereupon it would dissolve into dust.

==Development==
This spell was created by the [[lich]] [[Shangalar the Black]], before achieving lichdom. Its written origin was in his [[Book of Shangalar the Black|personal spellbook]].

==Components==
This spell had somatic, verbal, and material components, requiring a normal bladed weapon and a piece of bone, both of which would be destroyed in its casting.
