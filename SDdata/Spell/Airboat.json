        "mainbody": "'''''Airboat''''' was an [[alteration]] and [[enchantment]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "With this spell the caster selected a cloud overhead to come toward them, changing in shape to resemble a vessel of the caster's choosing. Though an ''airboat'' still resembled a cloud, it was solid enough to support the caster and many more individuals. An ''airboat's'' maximum speed was {{SI|90|mi|long=yes}} per hour. The caster used mental commands to control the speed and direction of the ''airboat'', preventing them from casting other spells.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast. This spell only functioned if cast under a cloudy sky."
