Missing word was a divination spell used by the clergy of Oghma to beseech their deity for lost or obscured information.
This spell was held with some reverence by the Oghman clergy. Its overuse was looked upon poorly by the Lord of Knowledge.
This spell was used when by Oghman clerics when encountered an illustration, inscription or other written document that was missing a significant portion. It could even be used to make whole an incomplete spell incantation.
When this spell was cast, the cleric was surrounded by a purple-white aura. Either the spell succeeded, and the missing information was temporarily revealed, or it failed, and cleric merely received a brief vision.
The specifications of this spell could be revealed upon a surface by the Oghman relic, the Key of Faith.
This spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast.
