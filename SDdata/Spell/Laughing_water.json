        "mainbody": "'''''Laughing water''''' was a [[divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that transformed a small amount of water into ''laughing water''.",
        "Effects": "When this spell was cast, the [[cleric]] transformed a small volume of mostly-water liquid into a substances known as ''laughing water''.\n\n''Laughing water'' had a number of curative and helpful benefits. Tasting a drop of the liquid completely reversed any exhaustion an individual felt. A single mouthful cleansed the individual from diseases, parasites, reversed effects of insanity and cure ''[[blindness]]''.\n\n''Laughing water'' served as a substitute for ''[[holy water]]'' in rituals of the [[Eldath]]yn faith, albeit at double the required volume. It was harmful to the [[undead]] and even negated the effects of the spell ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter]]'', when splashed on an affected individual.",
        "History": "The specifications of this spell were inscribed upon the Eldathyn [[relic]], the ''[[Crystrum of Tranquility]]''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required an amount of water, a pinch of [[diamond]] dust, and a seed taken from a young, green plant."
