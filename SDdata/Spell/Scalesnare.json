        "mainbody": "Scalesnare was a spell unique to Maztica.\nThis spell allowed the caster to transform snake skin into a grasping tentacle composed of hishna magic. After the casting was complete, the caster threw the snake skin at a target, who had to be within 10 feet (3 meters). The transformed snake skin then wrapped itself around the target creature, binding its arms. The target was then unable to use their arms to use a weapon or weave a spell. The grasping tentacle remained in place for up to a full day, and could not be cut by any mundane blade. Large creatures such as an ogre would be unaffected by this spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, snake skin."
