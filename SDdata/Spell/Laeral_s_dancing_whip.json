        "mainbody": "'''''Laeral's dancing whip''''' was a simple [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell animated an item that was then used as a floating weapon. The item was transformed into a brilliant white light that was {{SI|5|ft}} in length and floated in the air, attacking a target chosen by the caster. The weapon was able to see through illusions and could detect invisible or shapechanged creatures. The weapon was not damaged as a result of its attacks. The weapon could be used against any target within {{SI|10|ft}} of the caster. This range increased as the caster's skill level grew. The weapon was vulnerable to ''[[dispel magic]]''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], the item selected by the caster. The item had to be small enough to be carried by the caster one-handed, such as a small piece of wood or a whip. During casting, the caster tossed it into the air. The selected item was consumed by the spell."
