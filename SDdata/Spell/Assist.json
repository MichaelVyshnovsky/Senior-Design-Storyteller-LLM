        "mainbody": "Assist was a necromancy/conjuration spell that increased the heartiness of a specific person.\nThis spell functioned in a similar manner to the version of the divine spell aid, but did not affect the morale of the recipient.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell had the material component of a small amount of strong-smelling herbs. The recipient was required to inhale their odor for the spell to take effect."
