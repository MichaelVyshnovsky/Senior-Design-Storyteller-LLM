'''''Spider shape''''' was an [[arcane]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by the [[drow]] in the [[Underdark]]. It would transform the caster, or the target, into an arachnid form.

==Effects==
The spell could be cast upon any creature on touch. If cast upon a willing recipient, including themselves, they would assume an arachnid form, such as a [[phase spider]]. The spell could also be cast on an unwilling target, but they could resist the spell, and instead be left confused. The target of the spell would take some time to adjust to their new spider-like abilities. The newly assumed form could ''[[spider climb]]'' and move through web-like material, similar to the effects of the ''[[immunity to adherence]]'' spell.

The recipient of the spell also had access to abilities that the spider of the same form would have, such as leaping and even biting for the same damage. However, the toxins of the spider were not usable. It was not possible to web-spin whilst in this form, but a single [[Webstone|web]] spell could be cast. If a larger spider form was assumed, this form could be used as a mount, carrying multiple members of the party, and their equipment, through webbed terrain.

The spider form remained unless the caster chose to free the target (via touch), including themselves, or until the spell ended.

==Components==
Only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components were required.
