        "mainbody": "'''''Cathala's compulsion''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[wizard]] [[spell]] created by [[Cathala]].",
        "Effects": "This spell targeted a single creature, forcing them to charge directly at the caster until the caster ended the spell or they collided with the caster. The target was only concerned with reaching the caster while under the influence of the spell, ignoring any foes attempting to attack them during this time. The frenzy of the spell allowed the target to move faster than they normally could. Attacks against the target using their momentum against them were quite effective.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a [[copper]] hook attached to a string of some kind to cast."
