Wall of stone was a conjuration or evocation spell that created a mutable stone wall.
As the name suggested, wall of stone created a wall made of stone. The thickness of this wall increased with the casters skill. The same applied to the area the wall occupied. This area could even be doubled by halving the thickness.
While the spell was called wall of stone, the result did not need to be a wall. At the casters discretion, the wall of stone could be turned into practically any shape, as long as the wall of stone was rooted in existing stone. For example, the wall of stone could be made to create a magical bridge. If the length of this bridge did not exceed , this bridge did not need to be arched and buttressed.
It was technically possible to entrap creatures by casting this spell, but it only worked on creatures with slow reflexes.
A wall of stone could be destroyed by completely mundane means or by means of a disintegrate spell.
The spell required verbal, somatic and material components. The material needed was a small block of granite.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Mavin in  and was originally called Mavins stonewall.
