        "mainbody": "'''''Find companion''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Malar]], enabling them to summon the aid of animals.",
        "Effects": "This spell summoned an animal companion to aid the caster or for companionship. The caster could only have one animal companion at a time and they had no control over which animal answered the spell's call. However, animals that answered had longer lives and higher intelligence than others of their kind. The caster also gained the heightened senses of the animal and could communicate with it via telepathy. The animal would begin to suffer physical harm if separated from the caster by a distance greater than a mile or for more than a day.\n\nThe spell involved an hour long prayer where the priest petitioned their deity and burned incense. The animal would arrive several hours later. The animal companion would leave the priest's side if abused in any way.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] incense worth at least 100 [[gp]] to cast."
