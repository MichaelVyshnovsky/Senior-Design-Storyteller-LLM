        "Effects": "This cantrip was a variation of ''[[groan]]'' that created an illusion of the sound given off by the movement of chains. The sound appeared to come from within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} from the caster.<ref group=\"note\">The original description of this spell in [[Dragon magazine 60|''Dragon'' #60]] used the 1{{st}}-edition nomenclature <code>1\"</code>, meaning {{SI|10|ft}} indoors and {{SI|10|yd}} outdoors. This was simplified to the shorter range in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. The caster could choose to imitate metal chains or some other method of making a similar sound, like [[coin]]s being poured from a [[pouch]], for example. The spot chosen for the emanation of the sound could be anywhere within the range, regardless of barriers, walls, or containers. Creatures in close proximity that could be expected to hear the sound had a chance to resist the spell. If successful, they not aware of the illusion.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster named a device that could rattle and moved a hand rapidly, as if shaking a handful of chains."
