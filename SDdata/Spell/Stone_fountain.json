        "Effects": "''Stone fountain'' was a variant spell of ''[[towerfall]]'', which quite simply lifted and knocked over huge stone structures, like castle towers, bridges, and city walls. ''Stone fountain'' extended this power to hurling the debris across the land. For example, a stone structure could be lifted up to three times its height into the air and thrown back down again, launching stone blocks in all directions except a 120Â° arc selected by the caster.",
        "History": "[[Inhil Lauthdryn|Inhil \"Hurler-of-Stars\" Lauthdryn]], the [[Magister]] from [[1282 DR]] to [[1294 DR]], had a special love of blowing up castles, hence his creation of ''towerfall'' and ''stone fountain''. He took the secrets of the spells to his grave in [[1294 DR|the Year of Deep Moon, 1294 DR]]."
