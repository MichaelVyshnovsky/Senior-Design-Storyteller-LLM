        "mainbody": "Hold monster was an enchantment spell that held a targeted creature helpless.\nThis spell functioned in the same manner as hold person, except that it could be used against any creature who failed to resist to its effect.\nFor as long as the caster concentrated, up to one minute, the spell caused one or more creatures to be paralyzed. While under its effect, a paralyzed creature could repeatedly try to break free from the spell. Undead creatures were immune to this spell.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic and material components. The material required was one hard metal bar or rod, which could be as small as a three-penny nail,\nThe spell was attributed to the Netherese arcanist Prug in  and was originally called Prugs hold being."
