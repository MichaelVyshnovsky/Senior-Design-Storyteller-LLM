'''''Slingstar''''' was an [[alteration]]/[[evocation]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to transform a number of stones or [[bullet]]s, that were loosed from a [[sling]], into [[arcane]] projectiles that resembled ''[[magic missile]]s''.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell charged a [[wizard|wizard's]] sling with magical energy, causing it to transform mundane ammunition into ''magic missiles'' over several seconds. These ''missiles'' were affected by any items, spells or abilities that affected typical ''magic missiles'' however they were capable of penetrating the defenses of the [[abjuration]] spell ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]''.

The number of projectiles that could be transformed and released under a single casting of ''slingstar'' increased depending on the power and experience of the caster.

==Usage==
This spell was commonly known by several members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Casting==
In addition to a [[verbal component]]s, ''slingstar'' used the motion of the caster whirling their sling as a [[somatic component]]. Its [[material component]] consisted of any stones or bullets that were fired during the spell's duration.
