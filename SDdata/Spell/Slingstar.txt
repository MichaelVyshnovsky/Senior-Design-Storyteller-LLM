Slingstar was an alteration/evocation spell that allowed the caster to transform a number of stones or bullets, that were loosed from a sling, into arcane projectiles that resembled magic missiles.
When cast, this spell charged a wizards sling with magical energy, causing it to transform mundane ammunition into magic missiles over several seconds. These missiles were affected by any items, spells or abilities that affected typical magic missiles however they were capable of penetrating the defenses of the abjuration spell shield.
The number of projectiles that could be transformed and released under a single casting of slingstar increased depending on the power and experience of the caster.
This spell was commonly known by several members of the City Watch of Waterdeep.
In addition to a verbal components, slingstar used the motion of the caster whirling their sling as a somatic component. Its material component consisted of any stones or bullets that were fired during the spells duration.
