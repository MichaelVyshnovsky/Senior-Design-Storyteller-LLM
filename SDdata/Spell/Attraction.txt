'''''Attraction''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] spell common in [[Kara-Tur]] that caused attacks to be more attracted to a target. It was the reverse of the spell ''[[deflection]]''.

==Effects==
The targeted creature was surrounded by a mystical aura that drew physical attacks toward it, both melee and ranged attacks but not magical ones. The subject of the spell could be anywhere within close range of the caster, and the attraction to attacks lasted for over ten seconds, depending on the power of the caster.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
