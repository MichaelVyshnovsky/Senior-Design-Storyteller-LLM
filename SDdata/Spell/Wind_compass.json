        "mainbody": "Wind compass was a spell used by wizards in Anauroch and Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by wizards.\nThis spell created a small moaning wind in the casters ear that only he or she could hear. The caster chose a direction and whenever their ear faced that direction they would hear a steady tone. Moving the ear from the selected direction raised or lowered the pitch of the tone. This spell lasted for several hours based on the casters power.\nThis spell required a bit of earth mixed with spittle to cast."
