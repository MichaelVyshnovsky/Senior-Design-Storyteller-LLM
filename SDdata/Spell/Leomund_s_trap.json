        "mainbody": "Leomunds trap was an arcane illusion spell that fooled thieves.\nWhen placed upon a small device such as a lock, Leomunds trap would make anyone capable of detecting traps by normal or magical means believe that a real trap was present on the object. The trap was merely a clever illusion designed to keep thieves away.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a piece of iron pyrite touched by the object to be trapped while the same object was sprinkled with a special dust that cost 200 gp to cast.\nThis spell was included in Glanvyls Workbook."
