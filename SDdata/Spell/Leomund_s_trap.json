        "Effects": "When placed upon a small device such as a [[lock]], ''Leomund's trap'' would make anyone capable of detecting [[trap]]s by normal or magical means believe that a real trap was present on the object. The trap was merely a clever illusion designed to keep thieves away.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a piece of [[iron pyrite]] touched by the object to be trapped while the same object was sprinkled with a special dust that cost 200 [[gp]] to cast.",
        "History": "This spell was included in [[Glanvyl's Workbook]]."
