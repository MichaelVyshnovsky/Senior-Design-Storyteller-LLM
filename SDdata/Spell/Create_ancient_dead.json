        "mainbody": "Create ancient dead was a powerful divine necromancy spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Set called Nighthunters.\nThis wicked spell violated a carefully preserved and sanctified corpse by transforming it into a mummy. The type of mummy created depended on what type of person the deceased was in life. Corpses of dark-hearted individuals were transformed into free-willed mummies driven to crazed states until their destruction. Corpses of decent beings became mummies under the control of the caster for several hours, after which the mummy would return to its resting place or collapse to the ground into a lifeless heap.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a scrap from the burial shroud of a free-willed mummy to cast."
