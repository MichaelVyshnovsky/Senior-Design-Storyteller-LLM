Bone bite was a many-schooled divine spell available to priests of Myrkul. It would transform any bone or bone fragment held by the caster to transform into razor-sharp bone jaws that would bite any living thing with which it came into contact.
The spell had verbal, somatic, and material components, the last a partial or complete bone.
