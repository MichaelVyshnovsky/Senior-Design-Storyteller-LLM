Cone of cold, formerly known as Veridons cone, was an evocation spell that froze all enemies in front of the caster.
Cone of cold could be cast by sorcerers, wizards, and clerics who commanded the cold or ocean domains. The hoar fox had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the cone of cold spell at will.
The spell simply projected a cone of intense cold from the casters hand, draining heat from all caught within.
A casting of cone of cold required a very small cone fashioned of either crystal or glass.
In the Raumviran spellcasting tradition, the verbal component was the word siloat.
The spell was created by the arcanist Veridon of Netheril, ruler of the enclave of Lathery. He introduced it in 3419 NY (−440 DR) under the name Veridons cone. It later became known simply as cone of cold.
Cone of cold was a common spell in Faerûn in the 1360s DR.
In Waterdeep in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun and Onyx the Invincible were surprised by a band of lawyers. Khelben quickly blasted them with cone of cold, but they were merely chilled.
