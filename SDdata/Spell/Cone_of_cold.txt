'''''Cone of cold''''', formerly known as '''''Veridon's cone''''', was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that froze all enemies in front of the caster.

==Users==
''Cone of cold'' could be cast by [[sorcerer]]s, [[wizard]]s, and [[cleric]]s who commanded the [[cold domain|cold]] or [[ocean domain]]s. The [[hoar fox]] had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of the ''cone of cold'' spell at will.

==Effect==
The spell simply projected a cone of intense cold from the caster's hand, draining heat from all caught within.

==Components==
A casting of ''cone of cold'' required a very small cone fashioned of either [[rock crystal|crystal]] or [[glass]].

In the [[Raumviran]] spellcasting tradition, the verbal component was the word ''silo'at''.

==History==
The spell was created by the [[arcanist]] [[Veridon]] of [[Netheril]], ruler of the enclave of [[Lathery]]. He introduced it in [[-440 DR|3419 NY (−440 DR)]] under the name ''Veridon's cone''. It later became known simply as ''cone of cold''.

''Cone of cold'' was a common spell in [[Faerûn]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

==Notable uses==
In [[Waterdeep]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] and [[Onyx the Invincible]] were surprised by a band of [[Lawyers (Waterdeep)|lawyers]]. Khelben quickly blasted them with ''cone of cold'', but they were merely chilled.{{Cite comic/Lawyers!|6}}
