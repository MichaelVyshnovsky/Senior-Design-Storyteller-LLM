'''''Crocodile tears''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] and [[illusion]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Sebek]] called [[Swamplord]]s.

==Effects==
This spell made the Swamplord appear weak and feeble to onlookers and in need of aid, masking any menacing features about them including weapons, fangs, or claws. Anyone unable to resist the spell was compelled to move to the caster's side to provide assistance, dropping any held weapons or [[shield]]s in the process. An attack by the caster would end the spell early.

This spell had no effect upon [[crocodile]]s or [[werecrocodile]]s.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a handful of water splashed onto the priest's face to cast.
