Crocodile tears was a divine enchantment and illusion spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Sebek called Swamplords.
This spell made the Swamplord appear weak and feeble to onlookers and in need of aid, masking any menacing features about them including weapons, fangs, or claws. Anyone unable to resist the spell was compelled to move to the casters side to provide assistance, dropping any held weapons or shields in the process. An attack by the caster would end the spell early.
This spell had no effect upon crocodiles or werecrocodiles.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a handful of water splashed onto the priests face to cast.
