Daze was a simple cantrip that temporarily clouded the mind of a targeted humanoid creature. It was considered an enchantment of the compulsion sub-school of magic.
An eyeball, a minuscule relative of the beholder could daze opponents with one of its four tiny eyestalks.
The spell could affect a single humanoid within a close range. An effected humanoid was not stunned and could still move about but remained in a daze for about six seconds. Powerful or strong-minded humanoids were not affected by this spell.
This cantrip required a pinch of wool or another similar material, which was consumed during casting, and the use of verbal and somatic components.
