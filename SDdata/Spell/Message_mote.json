        "mainbody": "Message mote was an illusion spell that allowed a cleric to manifest a cluster of twinkling lights and short message, both of which appeared under certain specified circumstances.\nWhen this spell was cast, the cleric specified a number of conditions that would then activate the mote, along with a location at which it would rest. While in its dormant state, the mote could not be dispelled or detected.\nOnce the casters conditions were met, the message mote appeared as a cloud of twinkling light no more than  in volume. Based on the casters specifications the mote appeared in different hues, intensities and shapes, even moving a limited distance or forming simple shapes. If the caster chose, the mote \"spoke\" a short message in the voice they used while uttering the spells verbal component.\nThis spell was inscribed in one of the scrolls that were contained within the Balance of Belaros.\nIn addition to the spells verbal component, message mote required a somatic component."
