'''''Proctiv's seal crystal sphere''''' was a powerful [[arcanist]] [[spell]] that permanently shut off a whole [[crystal sphere]] against access by [[Spelljammer|spelljamming ships]]. It was the reverse version of the spell '''''Proctiv's breach crystal sphere''''', which undid an earlier-cast ''seal crystal sphere'',<ref name=NEA11> thus opening up portals again.<ref>

==Components==
Next to [[verbal component]]s, the [[material component]] for this spell was a [[spelljammer]] with a [[Wikipedia:Tonnage|tonnage]] of {{SI|100|ton|k|long=yes}}, including a [[major helm]].<ref name=NEA11/>

==History==
This spell was developed by the [[Netheril|Netherese]] archwizard [[Proctiv]] in [[-2051 DR|1808 NY (−2051 DR)]]. As one of the [[Epic magic|epic spells]] of [[Netheril]], it could no longer be cast after [[Mystra]] [[Mystra's Ban|changed the rules governing magic]] after [[Karsus's Folly]] in the [[-339 DR|Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR]].<ref><ref><ref>
