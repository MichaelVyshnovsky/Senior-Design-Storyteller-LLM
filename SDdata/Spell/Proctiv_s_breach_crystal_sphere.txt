Proctivs seal crystal sphere was a powerful arcanist spell that permanently shut off a whole crystal sphere against access by spelljamming ships. It was the reverse version of the spell Proctivs breach crystal sphere, which undid an earlier-cast seal crystal sphere, thus opening up portals again.

This spell was developed by the Netherese archwizard Proctiv in 1808 NY (−2051 DR). As one of the epic spells of Netheril, it could no longer be cast after Mystra changed the rules governing magic after Karsuss Folly in the Year of Sundered Webs, −339 DR.
