        "mainbody": "Divination enhancement was an evocation spell used by wizards.\nThis spell allowed the caster to extend the range and duration of the wizard eye spell specifically, as well as any beginner divination spell. The duration and range for these spells was increased by half. Divination enhancement affected any divination spell cast before the spell expired.\nThese spells only required verbal components to cast."
