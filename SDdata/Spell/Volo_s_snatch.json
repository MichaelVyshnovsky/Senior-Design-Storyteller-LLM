        "mainbody": "'''''Volo's snatch''''' was a spell that could pick up and fly items to the caster's hand.{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/Volo's Spells & Cantrips 1}}",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed to caster to pick an item within sight, no larger than their own fist in size, and fling it from a distance towards their own hand. It could not break loose items secured by [[chain]]s, rings, or hasps.",
        "History": "[[Volothamp Geddarm]], the inventor of the spell, mostly used this spell to steal [[tart]]s, though he occasionally used it to get out of sticky situations by obtaining keys, weapons, or tools. In one instance, he used ''Volo's snatch'' to hurriedly dress himself in lingerie while escaping a paramour's husband through a shop.\n\nAlthough Volothamp hadn't spread ''Volo's snatch'' around, several other spellcasters were inspired to devise their own equivalent spells, though these were generally flawed in some way compared to the original.{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1274028119641468932 | title = Ed Greenwood on Twitter | accessdate = 2020-06-19 | author = [[Ed Greenwood]] | date = 2020-06-19 }}"
