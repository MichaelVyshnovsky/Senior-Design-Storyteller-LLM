'''''Oars to snakes''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell that could be used offensively or defensively, turning a ship's oars into large [[sea snake]]s.

==Effects==
This spell was similar to ''[[sticks to snakes]]'' except it was specifically for use on oars, and created a few very large and tough sea serpents that remained in their oarlocks for the duration of the spell. ''Oars to snakes'' affected a minimum of three oars for at least a half hour, with more experienced [[druid]]s able to transform more oars for a longer period of time.

Most often cast defensively, a ship's oars could be used to attack boarders. Each snake could engage one enemy at a time and fought with a devastating, poisonous bite. Casting ''oars to snakes'' offensively, it had a range of 150 ft (46 m) and the snakes were oriented with their heads inside the ship to attack the rowers.

While the oars were in snake form, they were useless for propelling a ship. If any snake was killed in combat, it reverted to a broken and unusable oar when the spell ended. Otherwise, the oars were restored to their original condition.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small piece of wood and some scales from a sea snake as material components.

==History==
This spell was associated with the pirates that roamed the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and was a particular favorite of druids of [[Umberlee]].
