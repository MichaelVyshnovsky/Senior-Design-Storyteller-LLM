'''''Planar binding''''' (originally called '''''Valdick's snare''''') was a powerful and dangerous [[conjuration]] spell used by [[arcane]] casters to call a being from another [[plane]] and bind it.

==Effects==
The spell took a full ten minutes to cast and could call forth up to three [[elemental]] creatures or [[outsider]]s. Upon casting the spell, the requested individuals or types of creatures were pulled from another plane, somewhere within close range and usually into a prepared trap. A creature ensnared or bound in such a manner could be compelled to complete a task for the caster. In such cases, the magic released the being back to its own plane.

==Components==
[[Verbal component|Verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were required to cast this spell. The verbal component included the individual creature's proper name if a specific being was called.

The trap that actually bound the called entity was not a part of the spell. Such a trap must have been prepared beforehand and usually involved a ''[[magic circle]]''. The trap could be strengthened by use of a ''[[dimensional anchor]]'' to prevent the called being from using planar travel to escape or by the use of a [[calling diagram]] when setting up the ''magic circle''.

==History==
The spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Valdick]] in {{Yearlink|-1800}}, the same year that he also created his [[Maze|''enigma'']] spell.

In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''ensnarement'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}
