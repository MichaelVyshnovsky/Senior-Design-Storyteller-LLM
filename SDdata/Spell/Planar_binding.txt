Planar binding (originally called Valdicks snare) was a powerful and dangerous conjuration spell used by arcane casters to call a being from another plane and bind it.
The spell took a full ten minutes to cast and could call forth up to three elemental creatures or outsiders. Upon casting the spell, the requested individuals or types of creatures were pulled from another plane, somewhere within close range and usually into a prepared trap. A creature ensnared or bound in such a manner could be compelled to complete a task for the caster. In such cases, the magic released the being back to its own plane.
Verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. The verbal component included the individual creatures proper name if a specific being was called.
The trap that actually bound the called entity was not a part of the spell. Such a trap must have been prepared beforehand and usually involved a magic circle. The trap could be strengthened by use of a dimensional anchor to prevent the called being from using planar travel to escape or by the use of a calling diagram when setting up the magic circle.
The spell was invented by the Netherese arcanist Valdick in , the same year that he also created his enigma spell.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast ensnarement within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.
