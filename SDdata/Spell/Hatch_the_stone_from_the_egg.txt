Hatch the stone from the egg was a bizarre spell combining alteration, enchantment, and evocation arcane magic that was used by wizards.
This spell was used to create a magic item known as a philosophers stone. After researching the required alchemical formula and gathering the necessary ingredients, the caster enchanted the mixture with the enchant an item spell followed by the hatch the stone from the egg spell which slowly transformed the mixture into the philosophers stone. A permanency spell completed the process.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a philosophers egg to cast. The egg was not destroyed when casting the spell.
