Forcefend was a spell that protected a caster.
When cast, the spell provided temporary protection to the caster via a field of force. It protected the caster from all spells and magical items, as long as the caster was the target. The spell redirected a spell to another target within  chosen by the caster. The caster was unable to redirect the spell back to the individual who cast it. A caster under protection of this spell was unable to cast another spell until the field of force expired, if they did the spell was nullified. However, the caster was still able to use magical items and physical movements.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
