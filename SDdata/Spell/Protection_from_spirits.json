        "mainbody": "'''''Protection from spirits''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell created a magical barrier 5 feet (1.5 meters) in radius. This barrier blocked most [[spirit]]s from entering its interior. While they could not enter, spirits were still able to fire missiles and spells past the barrier. The barrier was most effective against lesser spirits; a strong-enough greater spirit could penetrate the barrier.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a wand made from a ginkgo tree. Strips of [[paper]] covered in prayers were attached to the wand."
