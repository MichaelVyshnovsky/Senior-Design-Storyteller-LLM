        "mainbody": "Protection from spirits was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the spell created a magical barrier 5 feet (1.5 meters) in radius. This barrier blocked most spirits from entering its interior. While they could not enter, spirits were still able to fire missiles and spells past the barrier. The barrier was most effective against lesser spirits a strong-enough greater spirit could penetrate the barrier.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component a wand made from a ginkgo tree. Strips of paper covered in prayers were attached to the wand."
