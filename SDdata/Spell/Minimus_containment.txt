Minimus containment was one of many spells within the Demonomicon of Iggwilv. 
When cast, this spell entrapped the body and spirit of a targeted elemental or outsider within a gem. The targeted creature remain trapped within the gem for a period of time set by the caster or until a certain condition was met. Once the specific condition was met, the creature was released and forced to perform a task that was predetermined by the caster. Once the task was completed, the spell ended, sending the formally entrapped creature back to their home plane, and the gem crumbled to dust.
This spell could only be cast upon a creature already trapped with a planar binding spell. Furthermore, the targeted creature had to both be aware and also agree to the terms set by the caster for the spell to be successfully cast. As one can imagine, it was very difficult to convince a creature to agree to submit to the spell. The spell could not force a creature to perform a task that was impossible for them to perform.
A bound creature could be transferred to another non-organic object such as a spellbook or weapon. This allowed the caster to bind the creature to an object and act as its guardian. This was achieved by grinding the gem into dust and sprinkling it on the desired object. This process was tricky. If the caster lacked the required strength and will, the transfer failed and the creature was released and returned to their home plane.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a focus, the gem itself, with a value of at least 100 gp.
