        "mainbody": "'''''Spell trigger''''' was a spell that allowed another spell to trigger on conditions.",
        "Effects": "While memorizing the spell, the wizard had to cast (or touch the caster of) another spell, less powerful than the ''spell trigger'' itself. Then, conditions were set, akin to the ''[[magic mouth]]'' spell, and the other spell stored in the trigger would be activated upon those. The caster could then cast the spell and touch an object; if the conditions set during memorization ever came true within {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}}, the second spell took effect.\n\nThe ''spell trigger'' itself could linger for millenia untriggered.",
        "Components": "Beyond [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell also needed a pinch of ash from a burned scroll, which had to be bearing a spell at the time of burning.",
        "History": "[[Azuth]] made this spell available through [[Elminster]] sometime prior to {{yearlink|1370}}.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|101}}"
