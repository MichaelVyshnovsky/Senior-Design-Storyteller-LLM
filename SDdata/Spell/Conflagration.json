        "mainbody": "Conflagration was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell set a living target ablaze, burning at least the first layer of flesh from its body. Living creatures standing within  of the target also risked catching fire.\nItems carried by the target usually caught fire and were destroyed, fueling the blaze even further.\nAttempting to douse the flames with water or sand caused a  cloud of burning vapor to surround the target. Complete immersion of the target under huge amounts of sand or water greatly reduced the burning vapor but did not douse the flames.\nOnce killed by the flames, the target rose as an undead servant under the casters command. The caster was unable to cast other spells while controlling the undead.\nThis spell required a material component in the form of a wax doll to cast."
