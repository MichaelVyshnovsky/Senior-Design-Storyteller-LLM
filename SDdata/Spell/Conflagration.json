        "Effects": "This spell set a living target ablaze, burning at least the first layer of flesh from its body. Living creatures standing within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the target also risked catching fire.\n\nItems carried by the target usually caught fire and were destroyed, fueling the blaze even further.\n\nAttempting to douse the flames with water or [[sand]] caused a {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} cloud of burning vapor to surround the target. Complete immersion of the target under huge amounts of sand or water greatly reduced the burning vapor but did not douse the flames.\n\nOnce killed by the flames, the target rose as an [[undead]] servant under the caster's command. The caster was unable to cast other spells while controlling the undead.",
        "Components": "This spell required a [[material component]] in the form of a wax doll to cast."
