        "mainbody": "'''''Oathbinding''''' was a [[spell]] used commonly in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell bound a subject to a predetermined vow or condition, and exacted a penalty for failing to uphold the vow. Though ''oathbinding'' was similar to the ''[[genie contract]]'' spell, but differed because only one party was the subject of the spell. It was commonly used by a more powerful patron on their subjects. This spell had a definite end and specific condition which would trigger the penalty for breaking the vow. The spell would only end when the vow was fulfilled. ''[[Dispel magic]]'' or ''[[remove curse]]'' spells had no effect upon this spell.",
        "Components": "This spell only required verbal components to cast, but the caster did need to sacrifice at least 1,000 [[gold]] to seal the deal."
