        "mainbody": "Net of stars was a wizard spell from the school of evocation.\nThis spell created swirling cluster of small stars around the caster that could be used to strike out against targets or spin around the caster to serve as a shield. The caster decided during the casting if the spell would behave in an offensive or defensive manner and could not be changed once cast. The caster was unable to work other magic while wielding the net of stars as a lash, but could perform mundane actions while using the net as a shield.\nThe stars always hit their target when lashing out. Any targets touched by others coming to their aid shared in the harmful effects. The lash was fan-shaped and  wide at its base and  wide at its end and  thick. It could extend for  from the caster.\nWhen stationary, the net filled an area  wide and tall. The use of magic within this area was blocked by the spells energy. The caster was immune to harm from the net, but the energy within the net harmed anything that was both within the nets boundary or when attempting to cross the boundary.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components an eyelash from a wizard who had cast a wild magic spell and a small powdered diamond, moonstone or piece of rock crystal to cast."
