        "mainbody": "'''''Penetrate disguise''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Effects": "A shugenja used this spell to see through a disguise. It only worked on non-magical disguises, such as [[makeup]], [[mask (object)|masks]] and clothing. The spell also allowed the shugenja to determine if the creature was under the influence of a ''[[friends]]'' spell. The spell did not penetrate magical disguises or illusions, and was unable to determine alignments or intentions.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components."
