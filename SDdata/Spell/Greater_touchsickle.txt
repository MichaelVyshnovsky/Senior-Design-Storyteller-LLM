'''''Greater touchsickle''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to [[druid]]s, [[cleric]]s, and [[crusader]]s of [[Eldath]], the Mother Guardian of Groves. It was a more potent version of ''[[touchsickle]]''.

==Effects==
This spell was identical to the ''[[touchsickle]]'' spell except that the caster's hand became a ''[[sickle]] +2'' that could damage any and all creatures that were immune to normal weapons. The duration of ''greater touchsickle'' was eighteen minutes, with more experienced casters able to extend this time limit.

==Components==
Only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were required to cast this spell.

==Users==
Peacemen and peacewomen, the specialty priests of Eldath, were not granted this spell. For druids, the ''touchsickle'' was equivalent to a [[gold]]en or [[silver]] sickle for the purpose of harvesting [[mistletoe]] at its greatest potency.
