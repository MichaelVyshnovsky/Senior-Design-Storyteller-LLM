        "mainbody": "Dance of the fallen was a divine evocation and necromancy spell used by priests devoted to Tempus, enabling them to subdue foes.\nThis spell was used to subdue foes whom the caster did not wish to harm. This spell created a whirling wall of bloodless severed limbs where the caster desired. The barriers diameter could between â€“ as determined by the caster. Any creatures attempting to pass through the barrier would be pummeled by the whirling limbs and risked being knocked senseless. Only a quarter of the harm caused by the dance of the fallen was permanent, with the remainder being experienced only within a targets mind.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a handful of bone shards or hair to cast."
