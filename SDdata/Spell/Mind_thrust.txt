Mind thrust was a psionic power of the telepathy discipline that assaulted a foes mind.
Acting immediately, the power inflicted an intense, stabbing psychic assault on the mental pathways of a target creature. It did them slight psychic damage by "shorting" the synapses and piercing through thoughts and memories. The victim could reduce this with an effort of will or in psionic combat. It was fueled by the users desire. If an experienced manifester spent more psionic energy, they could increase the intensity. After the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, they could increase the damage and make it harder to resist, and after the Spellplague of 1385 DR, increase the damage and reduce the targets defenses.
Mind thrust was originally one of the five attacks of psionic combat and was a way of making forced contact. Later, it was strong against intellect fortress and tower of iron will, and weak against empty mind.
Early versions required an initial contact and mindlink.
Manifesting the power produced the standard auditory display.
"Mind Thruster" was the title of the second rank of the clergy of Deep Duerra, the duergar goddess of psionics.
Mind thrust could be learned by psionicists and psions, as well as by wilders and ardents and divine minds who bore the Mental Power mantle.
Mind thrust could be known by ikiryo, brain moles, su-monsters, blue goblins, crysmals, cerebriliths, callers in darkness, cerebriliths, and brains in jars.
In psionics terms, it could also be known by couatl, duergar, ki-rin, mind flayers, neothelids, and yuan-ti halfbloods and abominations. It could also be known by githyanki and githzerai by titans by astral devas, planetars, and solars among aasimon by amnizu and cornugons among baatezu by balors, glabrezu, and hezrou among tanarri and only by arcanaloths among yugoloths.
