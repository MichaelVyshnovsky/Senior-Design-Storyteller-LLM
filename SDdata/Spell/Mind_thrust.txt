'''''Mind thrust''''' was a [[psionic]] power of the [[telepathy]] [[discipline]] that assaulted a foe's mind.

==Effects==
Acting immediately, the power inflicted an intense, stabbing psychic assault on the mental pathways of a target creature. It did them slight psychic damage by "shorting" the synapses and piercing through thoughts and memories. The victim could reduce this with an effort of will or in psionic combat. It was fueled by the user's desire. If an experienced manifester spent more psionic energy, they could increase the intensity. After the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], they could increase the damage and make it harder to resist, and after the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], increase the damage and reduce the target's defenses.

''Mind thrust'' was originally one of the five attacks of psionic combat and was a way of making forced ''[[contact]]''. Later, it was strong against ''[[intellect fortress]]'' and ''tower of iron will'', and weak against ''[[empty mind]]''.

==Prerequisite Powers==
Early versions required an initial ''[[contact]]'' and ''[[mindlink]]''.

==Display==
Manifesting the power produced the standard auditory [[display]].
