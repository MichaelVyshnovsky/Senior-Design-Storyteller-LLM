Giant size was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, a wu jen grew in size. They grew 3 feet (1 meter) for every skill level, so potentially a wu jen could grow taller than even a titan. Only the wu jens clothing grew in size, while any equipment carried by the wu jen remained its normal size. The wu jen was also unable to cast any further spells while giant-sized. The wu jens strength increased relative to their new size, but their speed of movement did not. If the wu jen cast this spell in an enclosed space, they could be crushed to death. 
The reverse of this spell was minute form. When cast, the wu jen shrank by increments of 3 inches (7.6 centimeters). The smallest the wu jen could shrink to with this spell was 1 th of an inch (0.3 centimeters). After being reduced in size, the wu jen withstood falls, suffering only minor damage, but was vulnerable to wind and spells such as gust of wind or wind breath. Similar to giant size, this spell only shrunk the wu jens clothing and not equipment, and the wu jen was unable to cast further spells.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, either a dragon scale or some hair from a giant of any species.
