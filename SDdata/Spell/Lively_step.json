It affected allied creatures within {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} from the caster. The spell possibly also affected all forms of movement, not just walking or running, such as climbing, flying, swimming or burrowing.{{speculation}}\n\nAn [[elf|elvish]] version of the spell was known to the bards and mages of [[Myth Drannor]]. It could be cast using ''[[Ruehar's flute]]'' and it affected all elves and [[half-elves]] who heard the melody, giving them improved speed for running, dancing, and other types of movement, however, it was not usable in battle.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, as well as a small [[drum]] as an arcane focus."
