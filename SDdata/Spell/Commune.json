        "mainbody": "'''''Commune''''' was a [[divination]] spell that allowed a priest to ask yes or no questions of his or her [[deity]].",
        "Effects": "By means of this spell, the caster was put in contact with his or her deity, either directly or through a proxy, agent, or servant. The priest was allowed to ask one question per experience level and could expect a truthful yes or no answer based on the entity's knowledge at the time. Note that even [[greater deities]] were not necessarily omniscient, so answers such as \"I don't know\" or \"unclear\" were possible. If a yes or no answer would be ambiguous, the entity could choose to elaborate with a few more words if it served their purpose. If the caster's attention wavered between questions, the spell was ended.\n\nThe post sundering version allowed three questions regardless of level and if a one word answer would be misleading the answer could be a short phrase. if cast several times before a long rest it becomes about 25% more unlikely to get a answer.",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of the caster's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]], some (un)holy water, and burning incense. The newer version of this spell also exacted a price of a small amount of life experience.",
        "Trivia": "A servant of the Fallen, a cleric of a dead god, couldn't cast the ''commune'' spell."
