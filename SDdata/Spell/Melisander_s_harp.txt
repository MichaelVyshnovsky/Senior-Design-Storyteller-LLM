Melisanders harp was an alteration wizard spell created by Melisander.
This spell created an illusion of a shadowy harp. The harp floated in mid-air and could play itself and be moved or repositioned by the caster.
Any creatures within  of the harp were automatically affected by its music as if they were under the influence of a slow spell. In addition to this, they risked being put to sleep by the harp. The harps music also diminished other sounds and dimmed available light. Creatures within  of the harp were automatically under the effects of a feather fall spell.
Dispel magic or spells causing magical silence had no effect on the harp. The harp could not be moved through a magical barrier, nor could its music penetrate such barriers.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a silver harp string and three tears to cast.
