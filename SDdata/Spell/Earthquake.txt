'''''Earthquake''''' was an [[evocation]] or [[alteration]] spell that unleashed a powerful but localized tremor.

==Effect==
The effect of the tremor depended on the type of terrain it was cast in, so a cavern would collapse and damage those caught in the collapse where heavily damaged. Areas with structures or woods would cause damage to the structures and trees, and a swamp would have its water drained.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The materials required were a pinch of dust, a piece of rock, and a lump of [[clay]].
