Motes of moonlight was a spell used by clerics of Sehanine Moonbow.
When cast, this spell created a trail of twinkling silver light in whatever direction the caster was pointing at the end of casting. The resulting light was as bright as moonlight, and acted as actual moonlight for any other cleric of Sehanine. The length of the beam of shimmering light was determined by the casters skill level. 
This spell required verbal and somatic components.
