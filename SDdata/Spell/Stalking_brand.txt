Stalking brand was a transmutation spell used by rangers.
This spell allowed a ranger to mark a creature they touched with a small symbol that appeared only to the caster or a detect magic spell. The caster decided how they wanted the symbol to appear but it only measured an inch in diameter. The symbol glowed a light green and was still visible even if the target altered their appearance with magic.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
