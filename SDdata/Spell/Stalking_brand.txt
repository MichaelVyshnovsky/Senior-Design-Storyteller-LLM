'''''Stalking brand''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] used by [[ranger]]s.

==Effects==
This spell allowed a ranger to mark a creature they touched with a small symbol that appeared only to the caster or a ''[[detect magic]]'' spell. The caster decided how they wanted the symbol to appear but it only measured an inch in diameter. The symbol glowed a light green and was still visible even if the target altered their appearance with magic.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.
