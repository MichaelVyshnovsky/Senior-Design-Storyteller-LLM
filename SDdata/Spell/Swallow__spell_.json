        "mainbody": "Swallow was a conjuration spell that teleported a victim into a small extradimensional space but made it look as if the caster had opened his or her mouth wide enough to swallow the victim.\nAfter a successful touch on a victim, witnesses including the caster and the victim saw the casters mouth distend in grotesque fashion and appear to swallow the target creature. In reality, the target was teleported to a pocket dimension that was extremely constrictive, hot, humid, acidic, dark, and fleshy. The victim had one chance to resist the spell or be trapped. Once trapped, they were subjected to being dissolved in acid and pummeled by the pulpy walls until the spell expired, they escaped, or they died, whichever came first. While engulfed, they could use a light slashing or piercing weapon (anything larger required too much room to wield) to damage the walls in the hopes of doing enough damage to end the spell prematurely. Strong creatures or creatures that were trained at escaping tight places could attempt to overcome the constriction and get out, but the circumstances were very difficult.\nIf a victim did escape, he or she appeared in the same spot where they were swallowed, or in the nearest unoccupied space if that was impossible. If no such open space was available, then they remained in the trap for the duration of the spell. If the target died in the acid-filled space, then the body was dissolved and any possessions that survived the acid were cast adrift on the Astral Plane.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
