        "mainbody": "'''''Hex''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[warlock]]s to [[curse]] a creature.",
        "Effects": "A caster was able to use this spell to curse a creature within {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}}. The target creature had to be within sight of the caster. When cursed, the creature suffered debilitating necrotic damage until the spell expired. ''[[Remove curse]]'' could be used to remove the curse. The length of time a creature remained cursed was determined by the caster's skill level.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]. This took the form of an eye of a [[newt]], which had to be [[petrified]]."
