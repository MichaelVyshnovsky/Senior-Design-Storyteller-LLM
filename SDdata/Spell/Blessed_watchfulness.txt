Blessed watchfulness was an alteration spell that bestowed extraordinary powers of vigilance on a creature. It was one of the first spells that priests of both Arvoreen and Gorm Gulthyn learned.
This spell lasted a minimum of five hours (longer for more experienced casters) and granted the recipient alertness to their surroundings for the duration. Benefits included a greater resistance to beguiling, charm, emotion, fear, and especially sleep spells and effects. The target of this spell remained awake and vigilant, making them very difficult to surprise.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast, including touching the recipient of the spell.
