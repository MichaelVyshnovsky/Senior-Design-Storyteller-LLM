        "mainbody": "Darkflame arrow was an evocation spell that enchanted an arrow or bolt of masterful quality.\nDarkflame arrow was a spell that enchanted an arrow or bolt of masterful quality for a very short time. The projectile needed to be shot within six seconds of casting or the magic dissolved away.\nWhen the enchanted projectile was shot and hit somebody, the target was hurt not only by the projectile but also from black fire that engulfed the target. This fire was able to hurt not only those with resistance but also with those with immunity against fire as though they did not have such protection. The fire lasted only for twelve seconds. It was impossible to extinguish this fire except by waiting for the aforementioned twelve seconds to pass or by dispelling it.\nNo matter whether the projectile hit something or not, once shot, the projectile was consumed the spell.\nDarkflame arrow required verbal and material components. The material component for this spell was the projectile to be enchanted."
