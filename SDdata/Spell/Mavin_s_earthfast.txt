'''''Mavin's earthfast''''' was an [[arcanist]] spell of [[Epic magic|epic power]] used in the days of [[Netheril]].

==Effects==
The spell was originally created to allow continued mining of areas that would otherwise be too dangerous to mine. A casting of ''Mavin's earthfast'' made large areas of underground tunnels impervious to cave-ins and similar disasters. Its use was later adapted to preserve important areas of cities.

==Components==
The components needed for this spell were a [[stone of controlling earth elementals]], six [[chardalyn]]s (each imbued with ''[[transmute mud to rock]]''), and an [[earth elemental]].

==History==
The spell was created by [[Mavin]] around {{Yearlink|-510}} (3349 NY). However, after the near-cataclysmic destruction of the [[Weave]] caused by the casting of ''[[Karsus's avatar]]'' in {{Yearlink|-339}} (3520 NY) and the subsequent restrictions placed on magic by [[Mystra]], the spell could no longer be cast. Later ages remembered the spell simply as '''''earthfast'''''.<ref >
