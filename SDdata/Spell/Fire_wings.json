        "mainbody": "Fire wings was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the wu jens arms transformed into wings of magical fire. The wu jen and their belongings suffered no burns or heat damage. If the wu jen was wearing equipment such as a bracer or a ring, they were unaffected by the spell. After casting, a wu jen was unable to use their hands to grab an item or cast another spell. Any creature within 3 feet (1 meter) of the wings was damaged by the magical flames.\nThe wu jen was able to fly, and the wings acted like a light spell, capable of casting illumination up to a radius of 60 feet (18 meters). The wings could be used in melee combat. If a wu jen attempted to cast the spell in water, extreme wind conditions or freezing cold temperatures, the wings would not form.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components. A birds feather was to be burned at casting, and the wu jen had to have a gold amulet in the shape of a phoenix in their possession. This amulet had to be worth at least 50 gp and was not consumed during casting.A value for the amulet in Kara-Turan currency was not presented within the original Oriental Adventures source. Converting the gold piece value presented in Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Two, the price equates to 20 chien or 200 tael."
