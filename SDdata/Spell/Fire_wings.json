        "mainbody": "'''''Fire wings''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the wu jen's arms transformed into wings of magical fire. The wu jen and their belongings suffered no burns or heat damage. If the wu jen was wearing equipment such as a bracer or a ring, they were unaffected by the spell. After casting, a wu jen was unable to use their hands to grab an item or cast another spell. Any creature within 3 feet (1 meter) of the wings was damaged by the magical flames.\n\nThe wu jen was able to fly, and the wings acted like a ''[[light]]'' spell, capable of casting illumination up to a radius of 60 feet (18 meters). The wings could be used in melee combat. If a wu jen attempted to cast the spell in water, extreme wind conditions or freezing cold temperatures, the wings would not form.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s. A bird's feather was to be burned at casting, and the wu jen had to have a [[gold]] [[amulet]] in the shape of a [[phoenix]] in their possession. This amulet had to be worth at least 50 [[gp]] and was not consumed during casting.A value for the amulet in Kara-Turan currency was not presented within the original ''Oriental Adventures'' source. Converting the gold piece value presented in ''Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Two'', the price equates to 20 [[ch'ien]] or 200 [[tael]]."
