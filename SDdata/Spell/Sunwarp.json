        "Effects": "This was an impressive illusion spell that multiplied an image selected by the caster and filled an area with it. The caster could make one camel appear to be a herd, or one soldier appear as a band of mercenaries, etc.\n\nThe caster viewed the selected object through a quartz crystal and focused on one item on the object that the caster has touched. When this focal point moved, the rest of the illusion moved with it.\n\nThe illusion appeared to waver from the rising air heated by the sun.",
        "Components": "This spell required a small [[quartz]] crystal to cast."
