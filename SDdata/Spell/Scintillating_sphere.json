        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to summon a small [[grape]]-sized ball of energy that traveled in a straight line where directed.\n\nWhen the sphere reached the destination chosen by the caster, it would pulse twice and explode outward with electrical energy, damaging nearby creatures. The intensity of the explosion was based on the caster's power.",
        "Components": "This spell required a small glass sphere and a pinch of iron oxide to cast, as well as a [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] component."
