        "mainbody": "Icy terrain was an evocation spell learned by some beginning wizards that used cold terrain to impede their foes.\nWhen a wizard cast icy terrain, he or she filled a small area within 50 feet (15 feet) with a thick layer of ice, which caused any creatures within the areas 5-foot (1.5 meter) diameter without fast enough reflexes to slip and fall to the ground. For the next few moments, the affected terrain impeded enemy movement."
