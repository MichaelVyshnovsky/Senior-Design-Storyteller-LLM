        "mainbody": "Spark was a personal cantrip that beginning wizards could learn. It created a big blue bolt of electricity at a location chosen by the caster.\nThe caster could choose any point within  for the spark to appear.The original description of this cantrip in Dragon #100 gave an increasing range based on the level of the caster, and high-level casters could create multiple sparks in quick succession at the target location. Creatures targeted by spark had a chance to resist the magic of the spell and, if successful, received only an uncomfortable shock, otherwise, they suffered minimal damage. Metals and other conductive materials could transmit the energy released, therefore, a person wearing metal armor was slightly more likely to be shocked. However, if the target creature was very near death, this cantrip could not finish them off.This caveat was added in the Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four. Atmospheric conditions, such as dry air, humidity, or a nearby storm, had no effect on the size or puissance of the spark.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster simultaneously snapped their fingers and made a popping sound.\nThis cantrip was invented by Sabirine, a mage who supported the use and improvement of cantrips. Spark was recorded in the tome known as Sabirines Specular, along with catfeet and snatch."
