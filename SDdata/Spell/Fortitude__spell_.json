        "mainbody": "Fortitude was a spell used by clerics of Selvetarm.\nWhen cast, this spell allowed the caster or a targeted creature to continue functioning despite a fatal injury. The spell ended when the recipient of the spell either dies from their wounds or falls unconscious.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Selvetarm and a few drops of blood from a cave bear."
