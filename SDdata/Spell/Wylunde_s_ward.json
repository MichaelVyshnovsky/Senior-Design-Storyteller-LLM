        "Effects": "At the utterance of a single word, this spell erected an shimmering energy barrier around the caster, protecting them from the brunt of physical or magical harm for several minutes before expiring.\n\nIf cast again within 24 hours of the first casting, ''Wylunde's ward'' would have the opposite effect and actually increase any harm befalling the caster. If cast a third time, the caster suffered wracking pain that could prove fatal.",
