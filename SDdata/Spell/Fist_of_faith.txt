Fist of faith was an evocation spell that conjured a fist of invisible force energy.
When this spell was cast, a priest created a forceful and invisible fist that struck unerringly at another person or creature. While it was not harmful to inanimate objects it was exceptionally damaging to the undead.
Any being struck by a fist of faith was immune to further castings of the spell for a full days time.
This spell required verbal and somatic components to be cast.
The title of this spell was inscribed within the Helm of Helm and could be cast by utterance of its wearer.
