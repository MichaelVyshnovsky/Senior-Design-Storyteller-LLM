        "mainbody": "Improved featherfoot was a common spell used by ninjas. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThis was a stronger version of featherfoot. Unlike featherfoot, this spell allowed a ninja to walk on water without sinking, and had no reversal. The ninja had to take precautions when using this spell, as the bottom of their feet would be wet, thus potentially leaving a trail. The spell had all the effects of the featherfoot spell. \nThe spell required only a somatic component, kuji-kiri hand gestures."
