        "mainbody": "'''''Improved featherfoot''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[ninja]]s. The spell was very rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Effects": "This was a stronger version of ''[[featherfoot]]''. Unlike ''featherfoot'', this spell allowed a ninja to walk on water without sinking, and had no reversal. The ninja had to take precautions when using this spell, as the bottom of their feet would be wet, thus potentially leaving a trail. The spell had all the effects of the ''featherfoot'' spell.",
        "Components": "The spell required only a [[somatic component|somatic]] component, [[kuji-kiri]] hand gestures."
