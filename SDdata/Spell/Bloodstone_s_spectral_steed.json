        "mainbody": "'''''Bloodstone's spectral steed''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s. This spell was developed by [[Bloodstone (person)|Bloodstone]].",
        "Effects": "This spell created a spectral creature resembling a [[vulture]], capable of flying the caster and their companions about. The caster needed to name all passengers at the time of casting.\n\nThe ''spectral steed'' uttered ghastly screeches while it flew. Natural creatures shunned the ''spectral steed'' and only monsters would dare attack it. The steed did not have any form of attack and would vanish if destroyed.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]] to cast. This took the form of a [[whistle]], which had to be carved out of a hollow bone from a vulture's wing, and it had to be blown when the spell was cast."
