        "mainbody": "Burnish was an alteration/abjuration spell that restored the natural luster and shine of metal, including the scales of metallic dragons. The reverse of this spell was tarnish, which covered metal in an unattractive patina that would normally be caused by extended oxidation.\nFor the duration of the spell, any affected metal objects, including coins, weapons, decorations and even dragon scales among others, were restored to their full, natural luster. Additionally during this time, their shine could no longer be diminished by normal means.\nOne casting of burnish could effect up to 1,000 lbs (0.5 MT) of any kind of metal including copper, brass, gold, silver and bronze. Its duration lasted for a matter of days, depending on the skill and experience of the caster.\nThe reverse of the spell, tarnish, actively dulled the shine of metal, covering it an unsightly film.\nThis spell required only verbal components to be cast and was used primarily by dragons of Toril."
