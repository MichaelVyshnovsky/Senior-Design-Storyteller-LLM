Trollish fortitude was an arcane necromancy spell that gave the caster the fortitude of a troll.
The wizard, upon casting the spell, would gain the ability to regenerate, and ignore being dismembered or beheaded. Being killed by taking excess damage would not actually kill those under effect of trollish fortitude, but instead, they would become incapacitated and regenerate (their health as well as limbs, should they be held to the place of dismemberment). Like a troll, the caster was able to get up after being drained of health. Bleeding out and being wounded were also ignored, but health lost from fire or acid could not be regenerated.
This spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The latter component was dust from the crushed flesh of a trolls heart, and it had to be sprinkled over the wizard.
