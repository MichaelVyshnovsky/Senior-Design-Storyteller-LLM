'''''Geirdorn's grappling grasp''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s. This spell was developed by [[Geirdorn]].

==Effects==
This spell called into being a small hand of force that the caster could use to manipulate objects. The hand was invisible to all but the caster. The hand was twice the size of the caster's left hand. Controlling the hand required the caster's full concentration, so beginning a new spell or performing other dextrous acts left the hand hanging in the air until the caster was finished, at which point they could resume control of the hand.

The hand was unable to touch living materials, but could interact with everything else with the same strength as the caster but lacked any fine motor skills. It moved as fast as the caster could normally move.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a glove or finger bone to cast.
