Murdocks feathery flyer was an alteration spell used by wizards. This spell was invented by Murdock.
This spell created a feathery membrane between the casters arms and extending to their feet. With arms and legs spread the caster could jump from a height and glide through the air. The membrane would disappear instantly when the spell ended.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required an eagles feather to cast.
