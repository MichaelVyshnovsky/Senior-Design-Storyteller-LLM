        "mainbody": "'''''Divination''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] that was similar to ''[[augury]]'' but it foretold the outcome should the caster choose to enter a certain area.",
        "Effect": "The oldest version of the spell told of the strength of monsters and the value of treasure in a known area and if the caster would invoke forces of supernatural evil or good if they attempted to enter. It had a fairly good success rate that got better with the caster's ability.\n\nFor a later version, the caster inquired about a certain activity or event within the next seven days and received indications about success or failure of the venture. It would also tell if a goal would be advantageous for the caster. It had the same success rate as the previous version.\n\nThe next version of the spell performed similarly, but with a higher success rate.\n\nThe post [[Second Sundering]] version of this spell functioned much the same as the previous ones. It could detect future events seven days into the future and give a short answer. However, each casting of the spell before a lengthy rest would induce a greater risk of getting a random answer.",
        "Components": "[[Verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were needed for this spell, as well as [[incense]] and sacrificial offerings. The older versions needed [[gem]]s for more powerful divinations, while the newer versions required only incense and a suitable offering, together worth 25 [[gold pieces]].",
