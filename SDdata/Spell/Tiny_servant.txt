'''''Tiny servant''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s to temporarily animate one or more small objects into faithful servants.

==Effects==
The spell targeted one small, free-standing object, causing it to sprout arms and legs and become a creature under the caster's control for a period of up to 8 hours. The creature received the caster's telepathic commands, as long as they were issued from within a range of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} and followed them until their completion to the best of its ability. A ''tiny servant'' with no issued commands only fought in self-defense. Multiple creatures could be created at once by more experienced wizards, all of which could be commanded simultaneously.

==Components==
The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
