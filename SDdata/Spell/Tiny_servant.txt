Tiny servant was a transmutation spell used by wizards to temporarily animate one or more small objects into faithful servants.
The spell targeted one small, free-standing object, causing it to sprout arms and legs and become a creature under the casters control for a period of up to 8 hours. The creature received the casters telepathic commands, as long as they were issued from within a range of  and followed them until their completion to the best of its ability. A tiny servant with no issued commands only fought in self-defense. Multiple creatures could be created at once by more experienced wizards, all of which could be commanded simultaneously.
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
