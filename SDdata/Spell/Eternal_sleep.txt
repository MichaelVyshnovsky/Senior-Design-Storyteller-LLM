'''''Eternal sleep''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] from the [[necromantic sphere]] that caused the [[spirit]] of a dead [[dragon]] to pass into the [[Outer Planes]] for all time.

==Effects==
Once cast upon a dragon's corpse, the spirit of the dragon could never be ''[[raise dead|raised]]'' or ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]''. Furthermore, the dragon could not be contacted via spells such as ''[[speak with the dead]]''. This spell had no effect upon [[undead]] dragons.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] the [[priest]]'s [[holy symbol]] to cast.

==History==
This spell was granted to dragons by [[Null]], the Death Wyrm.
