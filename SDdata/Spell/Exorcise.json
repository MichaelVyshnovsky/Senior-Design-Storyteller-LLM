        "mainbody": "Exorcise was a divine abjuration spell from the necromantic sphere that negated possession of a creature or object by an outside force.\nOnce begun, the casting of the exorcise spell could not be interrupted or else it would be ruined. The spell stood a greater chance of succeeding if the casting priest was more powerful than the controlling entity.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and some holy water to cast. Possession of a religious artifact would greatly increase the chance of the spells success.\nExorcise was need to prevent a destroyed flameskull from reforming."
