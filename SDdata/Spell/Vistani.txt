The '''Vistani''' ({{Singular|vistana}}<ref>) were a traveling people, who never stayed long in one place and were always on the move. The Vistani were renowned travelers of the [[Mists]] in the [[Shadowfell]], which did not hinder them in the least. The Vistani originated from the [[Domains of Dread]].

==Description==
The Vistani had darker complexions and usually sported jet-black hair. They wore colorful and cheery [[clothing]] and were big drinkers.

==Traits & Abilities==
Vistani were usually regarded with suspicion because of their "Evil Eye", the ability to curse anyone they looked at. While the Vistana would get a mental backlash after the curse ended, some powerful Vistani could inflict very terrible curses upon those who'd wronged them.

==History==
[[File:VistaniCamp.jpg|thumb|275px|''The Heroes of Baldur's Gate stumble upon a Vistani camp.'']]
According to some, the Vistani came from the same world as [[Strahd von Zarovich]] did before the [[mists]] claimed [[Barovia]]. While other scholars within the Domains of Dread asserted that the place of origin for the Vistani was unknown and that they did not appear until a century later, around the same era that [[Jander Sunstar]] appeared in Barovia. Any alleged evidence of Vistani presence in Barovia prior to then was thus a scholarly mistake, confusing the domain's non-Vistani [[gypsy|gypsies]] for Vistani.<ref>

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of Vistani came to the town of [[Daggerford]] on [[Toril]] and did not leave until a group of unfortunate [[adventurers]] accompanied them into Barovia.

Also during the 15{{th}} century DR, a group of adventurers known as the [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate]] were pursuing a pair of [[werewolves]] that had robbed a [[Temple of Kelemvor (Baldur's Gate)|temple]] of [[Kelemvor]] they were protecting of relics when suddenly one of them activated. An amulet, originating from Barovia, created a thick fog that began to fill the air. The fog quickly filled the room and the heroes, the [[Kelemvorite]] [[Nerys Kathon]], along with the two werewolves and their associate [[Sangin]], were all transported to the Demiplane of Dread.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 1}}

On their first day in Barovia, the heroes stumbled upon the Vistani caravan of [[Madame Eva]]. She told [[Minsc]] his fortune using the [[tarokka]] deck, foretelling of failure to rid that realm of its evil. This sent the barbarian into a rage, smashing Madam Eva's table before storming out of her [[tent]], leaving his ally [[Shandie Freefoot]] to pay for the damages.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 2}}

==Society==

Vistani traveled in tight-knit family groups or tribes using barrel-topped wagons Each family was part of one of three culturally distinct, extended tribal groups known as '''tasques'''.{{Cite adventurers league/The Seer|7}} Those encountered by adventurers from [[Faer√ªn]] included the [[Boem]], who were primarily entertainers,{{Cite adventurers league/The Seer|9}} and the [[Kaldresh]], who were dedicated to the arts of crafting and tinkering.{{Cite adventurers league/The Seer|12}}

Some Vistani would offer shelter, food, and protection for travelers and strangers alike. While [[evil]] Vistani were likely help [[Darklords]] such as [[Strahd von Zarovich]] capture weary adventurers and take them into the Domains of Dread.

==Culture & Specialties==
Vistani were known for their musical talent as well as their skill in silversmithing, coppersmithing, cooking, weaving, entertaining, storytelling, toolmaking, and horse-trading.

The ''[[Book of the Raven]]'', found in [[Candlekeep]], was a journal about Vistani day-to-day life as well as the author's travels with them.
