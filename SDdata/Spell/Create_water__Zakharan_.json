        "Effects": "This spell created pure fresh or salt water at the caster's discretion. The water would pour from the caster's hands and simply flow away if not collected into containers. Up to {{SI|2500|gallons|long=yes}} of water could be created with this spell. The caster could turn the flow of water off at any time, but could not restart it. The water did not pour from the caster's hands with enough force to be used as a weapon. The water from this spell was permanent, but would of course evaporate like regular water.",
