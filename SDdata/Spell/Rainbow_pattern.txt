'''''Rainbow pattern''''', originaly known as '''''Nalevac's rainbow''''', was a [[spell]] that created an alluring light display.

==Effects==
''Rainbow pattern'' created an illusionary rainbow-hued, glowing pattern of interweaving colors within over {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} from the caster that would fascinate all creatures within a {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} radius of it. This spell only affected creatures that could visually see the pattern.

The caster could move this rainbow pattern up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} per six seconds by gesturing with his [[spell focus]]. All those fascinated by the pattern felt compelled to follow it. If lead into a dangerous situation while doing so, such as through [[fire]] or off a cliff, there was a chance that those affected might break free of the illusion.

Casting ''rainbow pattern'' required a [[somatic component]], a [[material component]] in the form of a piece of [[phosphor]], and a spell focus in the form of a crystal prism. Additionally, when cast by [[bard]]s this spell needed a [[verbal component]].

==History==
''Rainbow pattern'' was invented in the year [[-1964 DR]] by a [[Netherese arcanist]] named [[Nalevac]].
