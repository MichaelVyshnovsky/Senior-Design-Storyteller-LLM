It moved more slowly if the caster was looking more than only straight ahead. The eye could be created anywhere within sight but could move to any distance from the caster.\nSolid barriers blocked the eye, but it could fit through holes that were not smaller than its diameter. It could not pass through portals or other means of entering other planes.\nAlthough the eye could not be used unless the caster was actively concentrating, a break in concentration merely disabled the eye and did not end the spell, and concentration could be resumed later.\nthumb|A glassy floating arcane eye.\nThe spell took a full ten minutes to cast and required verbal, somatic, and material components.\nThis spell was the first of many developed by Netherese arcanist Trebbe in . It was then called Trebbes eye."
