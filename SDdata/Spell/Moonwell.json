        "mainbody": "A '''Moonwell''' was a [[magic]]al pool of water in the [[Moonshae Isles]] that was sacred to the [[Earthmother]] and her [[druid]]s.",
        "Description": "Moonwells were the source of might of the druids of the Moonshae Isles. Moonwells had their own sources of light, and were often surrounded by pillars of stone.\n\nThe Earthmother was able to manifest her power through the Moonwells. However, if corrupted by dark magic or filled with corpses, a Moonwell would become a '''Darkwell''', which could be used to summon or create [[evil]] creatures, or even act as a ''[[portal]]'' to other [[plane]]s.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1345}}, [[firbolg]]s polluted the Moonwell to allow the Beast, [[Kazgoroth]], to enter the world. The beast was killed with the [[Sword of Cymrych Hugh]], and the well was afterwards cleansed by the goddess.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1346}}, an army of [[undead]] captured the Moonwell in Myrloch Vale. The goddess used her power to spray white water from the well and saved her druids from death by turning them to stone. However, with twice-dead corpses dumped in it, the Moonwell became so polluted that [[Bhaal]] was able to manifest through it, and used it to create [[peryton]]s, an [[owlbear]], and a [[displacer beast]] from the bodies of animals lured to the well.<ref>",
        "Notable Moonwells": "There were several notable Moonwells of the Moonshae Isles:\n* The Moonwell of [[Corwell]] grove.\n* The Moonwell in [[Genna Moonsinger]]'s druidic grove of [[Myrloch Vale]].\n* The Moonwell in the [[Old Stone Wood]] on [[Oman's Isle]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|11}}"
