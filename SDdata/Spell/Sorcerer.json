Unlike most other [[arcane spellcaster]]s, particularly the [[wizard]]s they are often compared with, sorcerers had innate magical ability and were noted for their lack of study in obtaining such power. \n\nA sorcerer prefered to unleash their full power, without restraint, blasting their enemies into oblivion. As a result, the magic a sorcerer wielded was intensely powerful though often somewhat unpredictable.\n\n{{Quote|Even to the best wizards, magic comes slowly and with difficulty. Not so to sorcerers. For them, it is a gift, a natural talent that can be improved with time and patience, but a gift nonetheless. Needless to say, all those wizards who must work for their art tend to be suspicious of those who don't.|[[Melegaunt Tanthul]].}}",
        "Culture": {
            "Relationships": "As a result, most sorcerers did not get along very well with wizards and were usually, at best, competitive with the studied mages, with wizards viewing sorcerers as inept bunglers and sorcerers viewing wizards as obstinate and unnecessarily secretive prudes. However, many who were neither failed to see a difference between the two in practice. For similar reasons to their uneasy relationship with wizards, sorcerers did not typically get along with [[monk]]s or [[paladin]]s, though they often enjoyed the company of [[druid]]s or [[rogue]]s.",
            "Origins": "Sorcerers were often [[human]] or [[half-elf|half-elven]] in origin, in part because of humanity's diversity and adaptability. However, there was nothing particular about humans that made them well-suited for a sorcerer's talents, and individuals of any race could manifest sorcerers. [[Kobold]] sorcerers were particularly common, likely due to their [[:Category:Creatures with the dragonblood subtype|draconic]] origins, of which kobolds were extremely proud. Likewise, because of their draconic heritage, [[dragonborn]] sorcerers were also common, and considered by most the iconic example of sorcerers of the draconic heritage.\n\nArcane spellcasters from other uncivilized races were also more likely to be sorcerers than wizards, since they lacked the proper infrastructure and culture for the intellectual pursuit of arcane power. [[Gold dwarf|Gold dwarves]], [[wild elf|wild elves]], and [[lightfoot halfling]]s often also demonstrated a natural talent for sorcery.\n\nSorcerers were found throughout all of the world, though some realms had a greater tolerance for their talents than others. For instance, Aglarond, particularly during the rule of the Simbul in the [[Era of Upheaval]], held a great amount of respect for sorcerers. Similarly, many sorcerers could be found later on throughout [[Calimshan]], the [[Dragon Coast]], the [[Great Dale]], the [[High Forest]], the [[Lake of Steam (region)|Lake of Steam]], [[Mulhorand]], the [[Nelanther Isles]], the [[Shaar]], [[Silverymoon]], [[Tethyr]], and the [[Western Heartlands]],"

        "Abilities": "[[File:Sorcerer Class.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Arcane power flowing through the body of a sorcerer.]]\nSorcerers often played a supporting role in combat, selectively putting themselves at risk on the battlefield. While some sorcerers wielded spells that inflicted lots of damage on others, others preferred those with more utilitarian focus or that created a variety of different effects. To aid them in casting these spells, sorcerers made use of [[dagger]]s and [[staff]]s as [[implement]]s, which empowered their spells and made them more potent. And while wizards relied on their ability to learn and memorize for the purpose of spellcasting, sorcerers relied on their willpower and emotional presence to focus and empower their abilities.\n\nBecause a sorcerer's power was inherent most of their abilities were dependent on their precise ancestry. Many sorcerers were descended from dragons, at least distantly, and draconic blood, with its arcane infusions, made a potent source of power for many sorcerers, many of whom learned to tap this power in order to make themselves stronger, more resilient, or elementally gifted. Other sorcerers tapped into the power of wild magic, giving them an added versatility in their powers at the cost of predictability. Because this power comes naturally, sorcerers had an opportunity to pick up training in most simplistic weapons, giving them a slight edge over wizards in non-magical combat, though still behind other arcanists. Like wizards, the vast majority of sorcerers lacked training in the use of any armor.\n\nA few sorcerers, though not all, took on [[familiar]]s or magical companions who could be summoned to service. Like the familiars of wizards, sorcerer familiars could cast spells that their master is capable of using, as well as having the capacity to communicate with them on a very basic level.",
        "Sorcerous Origins": {
            "Aberrant Mind": "{{Main|Aberrant mind}}\n[[File:Aberrant_Mind_Sorcerer_Arena.png|thumb|right|300px|Some sorcerers' powers originated from forces beyond the Realms.]]\nSome sorcerers had their minds affected by powers alien to [[Toril]] and gained [[psionic]] powers as a result of the unnatural union. The sources of these powers could originate from other planes of existence, such as the [[Far Realm]] or [[Astral Plane]], or as a result of cerebral intrusion like stalled [[ceremorphosis]]. These sorcerers could tap into the infinite energies of the [[multiverse]] itself and manifest their powers in novel and strange fashion.\n\nAberrant mind sorcerers gained access to a number of spells associated with psionics, granting them the power to ''[[detect thoughts|read the thoughts of others]]'' or ''[[telekinesis|move objects with their own mind]]''. They gained the inherent ability to form [[Telepathy|telepathic]] connections with others and could communicate both ways without gesture or language. Over time they learned to better harness their 'psionic spells' and formed strong mental defenses against psychic attacks.\n\nThe changes that affected the psyches of these sorcerers manifested in their bodies as well, allowing them to perform fantastic feats such as flight on occasion. The most powerful aberrant mind sorcerers could warp space itself and create anomalous fractures that drew in nearby creatures and crushed them with pure force energy.",
            "Clockwork Soul": "{{Main|Clockwork soul}}\nYet other sorcerous powers were made available from the forces of order and harmony, such as the [[modron]]s of [[Mechanus]]. Individuals marked by clockwork efficiency viewed their powers as the perfectly-aligned cog in the grand machinery of existence. Their powers often revolved around exerting control over potentialities that were viewed as straying away from the cosmic order of all things.\n\nThe bodies of these sorcerers exhibited unique manifestations of order upon and around them, such as geometric figures that appeared over their skin, the ever-present sound of unseen machinery, or phantasmal gears that floated in their wake. They gained access to spells that helped them maintain order in the world, could manipulate the potential outcomes of others' actions, and use the forces of order to protect others from physical harm.\n\nSome more powerful sorcerers could attune their psyche with the infinite computations of Mechanus itself to enter into a trance-like state. While in that trance, their actions achieved a near-perfect synchronicity with the forces of order, preventing any non-desirable outcomes from occurring. \n\nThe most experienced of their kind could summon forth a company of spectral [[construct]]s that immediately repaired any damaged devices, including those of organic nature, and ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' lesser magical effects and enchantments.",
            "Divine Soul": "{{Main|Divine soul}}\nSome sorcerers were blessed with divine souls that granted them access to [[divine magic]] rather than the arcane. This favor from the heavens was sometimes the result of [[angel]]ic lineage or a momentous birth associated with a holy prophecy. Within some lands, divine souls were elevated to near-deific statuses themselves, while in others they were perceived as threats to established clergies.\n\nDivine soul sorcerers drew upon certain divine spells, which differed according to their [[alignment|ethical and moral outlook of the world]]. They were each granted blessings from on high, and were bolstered with powerful restorative energy. Over time their physical form took on the appearance of [[celestial]]s, as otherworldly wings would extended from their back at times.",
            "Dragon Magic": "{{Main|Draconic bloodline}}\n[[File:Dragonbornsorcerer.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[white dragon|white]] [[dragonborn]] draconic sorcerer.]]\nOne archetypical source of sorcery was the power inherent to dragons. Sorcerers that drew upon this wellspring were granted magical power by some innate connection to dragons, either through draconic bloodline, blood ties or magical infusion, such as being bathed in dragonblood as an infant. Dragon magic sorcerers were emotionally and quite often physically powerful beings.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|151}} \n\nDragon magic sorcerers were awe-inspiring and mighty, capable of channeling their pain into powerful rage and using their physical strength to bolster the power of their spells. They were exceptionally resilient and difficult to kill. Dragon magic sorcerers were blessed with both an affinity for and resilience to one of the elemental energies used by most dragons in their breath weapons, such as acid, cold or fire.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|136-137}} Those sorcerers of draconic bloodline that expertly honed their abilities could draw upon the frightening presence of their forebears and even grow a pair of wings, granting them the ability of flight.",
            "Shadow Magic": "{{Main|Shadow magic (sorcerous origin)}}\nSorcerers that drew upon the evil power of [[shadow magic]] called upon the [[Shadowfell]] itself, becoming a reflection of the dark plane that overlapped the [[Prime Material plane|Prime]]. Once known as [[shadowcaster]]s,{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Shadowcasters}} practitioners of shadow magic had their bodies and souls warped by the magic that coursed through their bodies, granting them terrible and mysterious powers unattainable by others.<ref name=XGtE-p50-51\">\n\n[[File:Storm Sorcerer.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[tiefling]] storm sorcerer with her head in the clouds.]]\nEven novice practitioners of shadow magic had their existence set upon the fine line between the living and the dead, making it more difficult for them to be put down. They quickly gained [[darkvision|improved eyesight]] while surrounded by darkness and could call forth shadowy beasts from the Shadowfell. Those sorcerers wholly dedicated their focus upon their dark powers could [[shadow walk|travel great distances]] via the Shadowfell and transform their body into that of an ethereal, shadowy form.<ref name=XGtE-p50-51\" />",
            "Storm Magic": "{{Main|Storm sorcery}}\nSome sorcerers of the Realms gained their abilities from the primordial powers of existence, such as the element of [[air]] itself. While others avoid gale winds and lightning blasts for their safety, storm sorcerers felt perfectly at home within, drawn to the fury and unrelenting power. In fact these powerful spellcasters may even have originally gained their power from a terrible storm that impacted their life (such as the [[Great Rain]]), either by being born within one or nearly dying from the destruction and havoc one caused.<ref name=XGtE-p50-51\" /> Many of these individuals chose to live at sea, utilizing their powers to help navigate ships and keep aquatic dangers at bay.\n\nStorm sorcerers gained an innate understanding of the [[primordial language]] of the cosmos, along with its four dialects including [[auran]]. They quickly learned how to summon gusts of wind, and in time gained limited control over weather itself. Over time their bodies became resistant and even immune to the effects of lightning and thunder, and in some instances could conduct and channel bolts of lightning within at will. These sorcerers whose souls had been entirely in tune with the winds even gained the ability of flight, and could even lift others alongside them as if by the gale forces of an unrelenting storm.",
            "Wild Magic": "{{Main|Wild mage}}\n[[File:Wild-Magic-Sorcerer.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An orc [[wild mage]] in spellbattle.]]\nThe terrible and wondrous forces of otherworldly planes, such as the [[Far Realm]]{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|138}} though more often as [[wild mage]]s, these spellcasters were capable of impressive feats of arcane ability, occasionally leading to unplanned or even disastrous results. The origins of each wild mage's power varied as much as their capabilities, at times brought on by a blessing or curse as often as random chance.\n\nThroughout their history wild mages acted as conduits for extraplanar magic, learning how to shape and control their [[wild surge]]s and even fate itself to their benefit.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|151}} They also developed means to protect themselves from errant energy discharged from their effects. Those wild mages that were most in tune with their powers could channel their power to devastating effect when casting magic that harmed others."
