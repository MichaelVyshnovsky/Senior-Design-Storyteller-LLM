        "mainbody": "Skulltrap, often known as skull trap, was a necromancy spell that could only be cast upon a skull.\nThis spell acted as a ward, and had to be placed on a non-living skull or that of an animated skeleton. The skulltrap remained dormant until it was touched by living matter. When the warded skulls were touched, by either friend or foe, they exploded with red or violet light. The explosions released blasts of energy from the Negative Energy plane and the power of the blasts scaled by the casters own power.\nAll living creatures within 10 ft (3 m) of the skull would be affected by the blast. The skulls position could be slightly moved without triggering, but only if it was moved extremely slowly, and by non-organic matter. Thin materials, such as the cloth in gloves, would still activate such traps.\nthumb|The symbol of the skulltrap spell.\nIn addition to the skull target, the spell required somatic, verbal, and material components. The material component was a small amount of dust from the remains of an undead creature with a strong connection to the Negative Energy Plane, such as a vampire or a wight."
