Energy immunity was a defensive spell.
This spell protected a target creature from specific energy types. These were acid, cold, electricity, fire or sonic. While the spell absorbed any physical damage, the targeted creature was not protected from the side effects of the spell. If the targeted creature already had either protection from energy or resist energy spells cast upon them, they were overridden by this spell.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
