        "mainbody": "Fiery fists was a flame spell used commonly in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by wizards.\nCasting this spell caused the casters hands to become engulfed in blue flames that were useful as weapons. Simple touching any opponent caused a fiery explosion that not only burned the target, but also released noxious smoke that caused them to cough uncontrollably for several minutes. Only a small amount of the smoke was released with each hit, causing only the single target to begin coughing.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a lump of coal to cast."
