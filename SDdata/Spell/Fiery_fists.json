        "mainbody": "'''''Fiery fists''''' was a [[Flame (province)|flame]] [[spell]] used commonly in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "Casting this spell caused the caster's hands to become engulfed in blue flames that were useful as weapons. Simple touching any opponent caused a fiery explosion that not only burned the target, but also released noxious smoke that caused them to cough uncontrollably for several minutes. Only a small amount of the smoke was released with each hit, causing only the single target to begin coughing.",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a lump of coal to cast."
