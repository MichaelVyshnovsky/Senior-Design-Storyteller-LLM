'''''Histachii brew''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Sseth]].

==Effects==
When cast upon a special brew of [[yuan-ti]] venom and other ingredients, this spell created an enchanted potion that when imbibed transformed a [[human]] into a [[histachii]] for 7â€“12 days. Humans resisting the potion fell into a coma and died within an hour unless revived with a ''[[slow poison]]'' or ''[[neutralize poison]]'' spell. Once enchanted, the potion's magic remained active for several hours before expiring, though it would still cause illness in any who drank it.

The transformation could be prevented by casting ''neutralize poison'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'', and ''[[heal]]'' in that order. Permanent slight brain damage would afflict anyone consuming the potion unless a ''[[wish]]'' or ''[[limited wish]]'' was cast upon them to reverse the transformation. Only a ''wish'' could restore the victim early before the potion's effects expired.

Any nonhuman consuming the potion would become violently ill, fall into a coma, and die within several minutes.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a liquid mixture of distilled [[herb]]s, roots, and yuan-ti venom to cast. This mixture was not consumed during the casting.
