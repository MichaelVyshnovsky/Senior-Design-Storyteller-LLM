Histachii brew was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Sseth.
When cast upon a special brew of yuan-ti venom and other ingredients, this spell created an enchanted potion that when imbibed transformed a human into a histachii for 7â€“12 days. Humans resisting the potion fell into a coma and died within an hour unless revived with a slow poison or neutralize poison spell. Once enchanted, the potions magic remained active for several hours before expiring, though it would still cause illness in any who drank it.
The transformation could be prevented by casting neutralize poison, dispel magic, remove curse, and heal in that order. Permanent slight brain damage would afflict anyone consuming the potion unless a wish or limited wish was cast upon them to reverse the transformation. Only a wish could restore the victim early before the potions effects expired.
Any nonhuman consuming the potion would become violently ill, fall into a coma, and die within several minutes.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a liquid mixture of distilled herbs, roots, and yuan-ti venom to cast. This mixture was not consumed during the casting.
