        "mainbody": "Eye of fire was a divine evocation spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Horus-Re called Sunhawks.\nThe Sunhawk casting this spell selected a visible target, pointed at them, and uttered the Mulhorandi word for vengeance, unleashing a beam of fire from their left eye to burn the target. Undead targets were more susceptible to the damage from the fire.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
