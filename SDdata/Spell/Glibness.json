        "mainbody": "'''''Glibness''''' was a [[transmutation]] spell that altered the caster's speech, making his or her elocution much more convincing and believable.",
        "Effects": "The caster of this spell was blessed with an agility of speech that greatly increased the chance that a bluff would succeed. It even made magical means of detecting or preventing lies,<ref>{{Cite web/Player's Handbook v.3.5 Errata}} such as ''[[discern lies]]'', or a ''[[zone of truth]]'', difficult and more likely to fail. The silver tongue ability lasted for 10 minutes per experience level of the caster.",
        "Components": "Only a [[somatic component]] was required to cast this spell, making it very subtle."
