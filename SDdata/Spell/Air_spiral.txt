Air spiral was a wizard spell from the schools of alteration and evocation.
This spell created a revolving staircase in the air shaped like a helix. The stairway began directly under the casters feet but the caster could choose where they were positioned on the air spiral and they could move it around at will. The stairway revolved in an area  long and  in diameter.
When moving about the air spiral could not penetrate physical barriers, but it could pass through any magical obstruction. The spiral would open a permanent passage in such magical barriers equal to its size as it passed through them. Only beings standing safely on the stairway were protected as it passed through magical barriersâ€”anything clinging to the stairway was not protected. An air spiral colliding with a solid barrier would do so gently similar to a feather fall spell.
Any creatures capable of reaching the air spiral were able to stand on it, climb it, cling to it, etc. Any creature maintaining contact with the spiral could breath under water if the stairway traveled through water. They were also immune to the effects of heat, cold, and electricity (magical and mundane) as well as harm from crushing or constricting effects whether from natural sources such as water pressure or from attacks from others.
The caster could banish any extraplanar creature in contact with the air spiral with nothing but a thought. The caster did not need to be in contact with the spiral to do this. The caster could also force creatures touching the spiral to revert back to their true forms or dispel any illusion on such creatures. At any time the caster could make the air spiral vanish at will or make it explode into whirling eddies of air. These eddies would extinguish any flame. They also banished creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Air and harmed others.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast.
