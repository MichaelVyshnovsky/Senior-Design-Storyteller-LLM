Negate magical weapons, also known as protection from magical weapons,This spell appeared in the Baldurs Gate series as a 6 level wizard spell called protection form magical weapons. was an abjuration spell that allowed the caster to protect someone from the magical abilities bestowed upon certain enchanted weapons.
For the duration of the spell, any magical weapon that struck a person or creature did so as if it were a mundane version of the same weapon-type. Furthermore, any spell-like abilities or effects produced by these weapons had no effect on the being under the spells protection.
The spell did not negate any powers of weapons that did not directly target its recipient and offered some protection from weapons with the special purpose of defeating arcane spellcasters. While it negated the extra damage these weapons could cause, it did nothing to stop the effects they caused, such as blindness or deafness.
