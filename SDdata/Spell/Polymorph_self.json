        "mainbody": "Polymorph self was an arcane alteration spell that allowed the caster to transform his body into another creatures.\nThe caster could polymorph into the shape of any creature in size from a wren to a hippopotamus, while his or her mind would stay unchanged. He or she would gain any movement and respiration abilities of the new body, like flight in bird shape, or swimming and breathing water in the body of a fish, but not special abilities like a poisonous bite when transformed into a viper. For the duration of the spell, shape could be changed multiple times. If the caster changed back to his or her own body before the spell ended, some wounds would be healed in the transformation.\nThis spell required verbal components only.\nThe polymorph self spell was developed by variator arcanist Quantoul in 1838 NY (−2021 DR) under the name Quantouls selfmorph.\nBy the 1360s DR polymorph self was a common spell in the magical community of both Faerûn and Zakhara.\nAround 1372 DR, the Year of Wild Magic, the spell fell out of use when the more versatile polymorph was introduced in the Realms.Polymorph self was included in the Players Handbook 3rd edition, but in the v.3.5 update the similar but distinct polymorph spell was used instead."
