        "mainbody": "'''''Polymorph self''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to transform his body into another creature's.",
        "Effect": "The caster could [[polymorph]] into the shape of any creature in size from a [[wren]] to a [[hippopotamus]], while his or her mind would stay unchanged. He or she would gain any movement and respiration abilities of the new body, like flight in bird shape, or swimming and breathing water in the body of a fish, but not special abilities like a poisonous bite when transformed into a [[viper]]. For the duration of the spell, shape could be changed multiple times. If the caster changed back to his or her own body before the spell ended, some wounds would be healed in the transformation.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[verbal component]]s only.",
