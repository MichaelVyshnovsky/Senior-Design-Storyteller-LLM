'''''Eye of power''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the schools of [[alteration]] and [[evocation]].

==Effects==
This spell was the same as the ''[[wizard eye]]'' spell with the major exception that it could appear at any distance from the caster, allowing the caster to cast other spells through the eye.

The caster needed to concentrate to move the eye around. The spell would end if the eye was destroyed.

==Components==
This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.
