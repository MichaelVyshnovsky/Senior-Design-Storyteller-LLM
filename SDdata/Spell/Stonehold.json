        "mainbody": "'''''Stonehold''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell caused arms of stone to rise out of rocky ground whenever a creature passed by. The extremely strong arms attempted to wrestle a creature until it had a firm grip. It would continue to hold onto the creature until they escaped or the spell expired. The arms may be detected beforehand by using spells or items which detect magical traps. The amount of arms and their strength was determined by the caster's skill level.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components."
