'''''Emerald burst''''' was an [[arcane]] [[evocation]] spell that turned an [[emerald]] into a stunning grenade-like weapon.

==Effect==
After the caster infused the emerald with energy, it flew at foes in close range and exploded on impact. This unleashed a pulse of coruscating green light that dazed [[neutral]] beings for six seconds and stunned [[evil]] beings for up to 24 seconds, while leaving [[good]] beings unharmed.

==Component==
As well [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, the spell required an emerald valued at 1,000 [[gp]] or more as a [[material component]].
