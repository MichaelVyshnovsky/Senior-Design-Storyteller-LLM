'''''Veil''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s and [[wu jen]].

==Effects==
When cast, the spell allowed the caster to cast an [[illusion]] over an area. This illusion was very realistic. The illusion was also physical. The spell could be cast on individuals as well. Only certain spells such as ''[[true seeing]]'' or ''[[true sight]]'' would dispel the illusion.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components. 

==Uses==
[[Deceiver genie]]s were able to naturally cast this spell once per week.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Monstrous Compendium Pages}}

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Smolyn]] in {{Yearlink|-1934}}, then called '''''Smolyn's veil'''''.
