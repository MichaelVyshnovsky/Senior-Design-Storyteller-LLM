'''''Circle of stone''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] from the [[protection sphere]] that created a magical protective field around the caster.

==Effects==
For ''cicle of stone'' to function the caster needed to be surrounded on at least three sides by pieces of stone larger than themselves. All participants to receive the spell's protection needed to be touched during the casting. The spell provided a number of benefits to anyone within the protective field including:
* Making it easier to resist the effects of poison, [[magic]], etc
* Reflecting the harmful effects of [[magic item]]s or spells fired at the shield five out of six times
* [[Dwarves]] within the circle were empowered, making it easier to strike their enemies

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.

==History==
This rare spell was granted by the various [[dwarven]] [[god]]s.
