'''''Jergal's mind probe''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[necromancy]] and [[divination]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Jergal]] called [[Doomscribe]]s.

==Effects==
This bizarre spell combined the ''[[ESP]]'' spell with the ''[[paralyze]]'' spell, allowing the caster to attack a single target by touching them. The target would be paralyzed for several minutes, allowing the priest to probe every corner of their mind for information regarding the target's faith, adherence to that faith, how they dealt with their strengths and weaknesses, and their biggest failures and accomplishments. The spell would end if the priest attempted to cast another spell or stopped concentration on probing the target's mind. The casting of this spell was viewed as a violation significant enough for the victim to develop a strong hatred for the caster.

This spell had no effect upon creatures immune to paralysis, mindless creatures such as some [[undead]] and [[golem]]s, and nonintelligent creatures.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast.
