        "mainbody": "Throbbing bones was an arcane spell from the school of necromancy that caused the targets bones to pulse within their body.\nThe magic of the spell would affect a single target, provided they had an internal skeleton. Movement and basic tasks were difficult for the target for the spells duration as they were wracked with pain.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component two pieces of a small bone that was snapped in half to cast.\nThis spell was found within the Book of Shadows, a tome based upon the oration of the necromancer Nebt Bhakau of Zakhara."
