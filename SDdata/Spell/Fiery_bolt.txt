'''''Fiery bolt''''' was a [[spell]] of the [[evocation school]] used most often by [[Warlock#Infernal Pact Warlock|infernal pact]] [[warlock]]s, though other warlocks sometimes learned to use it. ''Fiery bolt'', when cast, created a fiery ray of golden colored flame, which the warlock casting it shot toward a creature of their choosing within fifty feet. The spell, the potency of which was influenced by the caster's durability, if it hit, burned the target, as well as other creatures unfortunate enough to be nearby, with deadly (but easily extinguished) flames. The severity of the burns for those caught nearby depended, in the case of infernal pact warlocks, upon mental acuity of the warlock casting ''fiery bolt''. ''Fiery bolt'' was relatively easy to cast and required only a short rest on the part of the caster before it could be used again.
