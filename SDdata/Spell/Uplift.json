        "mainbody": "Uplift was a cooperative spell that allowed a priest to boost the spellcasting ability of another.\nBoth priests had to be able to cast this spell, which took 12 hours to complete. At the end of this long ritual, the more powerful priest was granted greater divine magic temporarily, allowing them to receive and cast extra spells.\nDuring the casting of uplift, the priests decided which new spells they desired and supplicated their deity or deities for them. Upon successful completion of this spell, the priests touched palms and the superior priest immediately gained the additional spells and had 10 minutes in which to cast them. At the end of this time, the priest that received the uplift became mentally exhausted and required eight hours of bedrest.\nThe only somatic component of this spell was the touching of palms at the very end. Verbal components included naming the bonus spell or spells desired. The material components were the priests holy symbols and an offering from each priest worth at least 500 gold pieces.\nCircle singers, the specialty priests of the Church of Angharradh, were capable of casting this spell once per tenday."
