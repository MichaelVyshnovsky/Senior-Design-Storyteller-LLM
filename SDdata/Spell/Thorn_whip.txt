'''''Thorn whip''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s.

==Effects==
A caster used this spell to create a long thorn-covered [[whip]]. The whip was similar to a vine. The whip was able to strike a target within 30 feet (9 meters) from the caster.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a stem from a plant. The stem had to have thorns on it.
