Thorn whip was a spell used by druids.
A caster used this spell to create a long thorn-covered whip. The whip was similar to a vine. The whip was able to strike a target within 30 feet (9 meters) from the caster.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a stem from a plant. The stem had to have thorns on it.
