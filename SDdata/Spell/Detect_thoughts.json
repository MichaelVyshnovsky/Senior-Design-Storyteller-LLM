        "Effect": "The caster was able to sense the surface thoughts of beings within range. How long they examined an area or subjected decided what kind of information was received. It could penetrate barriers, but {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} of stone, {{SI|1|in|long=yes}} of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} of wood or dirt blocked it.\n\nThe postâ€“[[Second Sundering]] version of the spell also allowed the caster to detect the surface thoughts of a creature and \"detect\" where they were. This spell could be used for interrogation and also to probe deeper into the target's mind. The spell could not detect or read the mind of very unintelligent creatures or creatures that did not speak any language. The spell reached 30 feet, and lasted 1 minute but could not penetrate {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} of wood or dirt, {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} of stone, {{SI|2|in|long=yes}} of regular metals, or a thin layer of lead.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and material components. The material required was a [[copper piece]].",
        "Variants": {
            "Witch's ESP": "a variant restricted to [[witch]]es, this required the caster to maintain physical contact with their target and instead of a copper piece it used a pinch of powdered [[nightshade]] as a material component."
        },
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Zahn]] in {{Yearlink|-924}} and was originally called ''Zahn's ESP''."
