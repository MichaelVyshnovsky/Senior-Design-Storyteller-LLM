Bloodwater was a common spell used by wizards in Ser√¥s.
This spell created an expanding zone of blood, within an area of  radius. This spell could trigger the natural blood frenzy of some sea creatures such as sharks or sahuagin. If triggered, the frenzied creature began attacking any creature near it, whether friend or foe. It could only be cast in water.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component in the form of a drop of blood.
