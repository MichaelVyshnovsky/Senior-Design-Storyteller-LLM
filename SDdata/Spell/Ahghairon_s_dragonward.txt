'''''Ahghairon's dragonward''''' was a powerful ''[[mythal]]'' cast by the famous [[mage]] [[Ahghairon]] over the city of [[Waterdeep]]. 

==Effects==
Centered under [[Ahghairon's Tower]], the mythal projected a permanent dome {{SI|25600|ft|long=yes}} in diameter, Undermountain, beneath the city, was unaffected by the Dragonward. In 1492DR, the effect did not extend to the harbor.

Any creature with draconic blood that tried to enter the city was overcome with an overwhelming urge to leave the area, never to return. However, any draconic creature that touched the ''[[Dragonstaff of Ahghairon]]'' was able to bypass the ''dragonward'' for as long as the staff's wielder allowed or until the creature was struck by the staff.

==History==
In the midâ€“11{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Ranressa Shiard]] returned as a hero from her journeys to Waterdeep atop the mighty [[copper dragon]] [[Galadaeros]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/239/Wyrms of the North: Galadaeros}} Although she was welcomed home, the appearance of her mount flying over the city unsettled the majority of the populace. Ahghairon crafted this ''mythal'' to allay their fears.
