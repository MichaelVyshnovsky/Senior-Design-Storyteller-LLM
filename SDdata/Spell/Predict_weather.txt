'''''Predict weather''''' was a [[spell]] used to accurately predict the weather in an area. 

==Effects==
A caster gained total knowledge of impending weather from sky conditions, precipitation, and temperature. The spell was able to predict the weather in an area of 9 square miles (23 square kilometers). The spell predicted the weather at least two hours in advance; this time-frame increased based on the caster's skill level. 

==Casting==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]] in the form of the druid's [[holy symbol]].

==History==
The [[Red Wizards of Thay]] were known to use this spell before the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]]. It was widely believed to have been lost to them afterwards.
