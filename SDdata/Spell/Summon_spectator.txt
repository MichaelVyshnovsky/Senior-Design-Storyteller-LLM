Summon spectator was a divine conjuration spell used by priests devoted to Helm, enabling them to create the ultimate guardian.
This spell summoned the spectatorâ€“a large orb with a central unblinking eye and four eyestalks to monitor each direction. The spectator was corrupted by evil forces during ages past, leading to the formation of the beholder race.
Once summoned, a spectator would serve a single task involving guarding for 101 years. The spectator would only allow its summoner or another priest of Helm to enter the area it was guarding. Its impressive telepathic abilities allowed the spectator to see through false claims quickly.
The spectator would remain at its post unless slain or blinded in all five eyes. If blinded, the spectator would return to Mechanus to regenerate for a full day before returning to its post. However, upon its return if the spectator realized its post had been breached, it would then return permanently to Mechanus.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a steel gauntlet blessed by Helm to cast. The gauntlet was consumed during the casting.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , Chief Prelate Dayspring of the Clerical Circle of Ravens Bluff declared it illegal for priests to cast summon spectator within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm, threatening arrest for those that broke this decree.
