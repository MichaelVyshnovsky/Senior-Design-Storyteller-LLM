'''''Unhallow''''' was a divine [[evocation]] [[spell]] for [[cleric]]s and [[druid]]s that marked an unholy site.

==Effects==
From the point touched by the caster, the ''unhallow'' spell covered an area 40 feet (12.2 meters) in radius, enabling it to encompass a building, structure, or other location. Only one ''unhallow'' could be placed on the area, but it was permanent. It countered ''hallow'', but could not dispel it. ''Unhallow'' had three distinct effects within that area.

First, the ''unhallowed'' area was warded by a ''[[magic circle against good]]''.

Second, all efforts by a cleric in the ''unhallowed'' area to rebuke [[undead]] through force of charisma were bolstered by the profane power of the place. In turn, efforts to turn undead in the same manner were hampered. This benefit did not arise for a druid casting ''unhallow''.

Third, one other spell could be attached to the ''unhallowed'' area. It operated over the entire area, regardless of how the spell functioned normally, and lasted a full year before expiring. The caster could specify whether it applied to all creatures in the area, only those who shared their faith or alignment, or only those of a rival faith or alignment. Spells that could be attached included ''[[aid]]'', ''[[bane]]'', ''[[bless]]'', ''[[cause fear]]'', ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[daylight]]'', ''[[death ward]]'', ''[[deeper darkness]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[dimensional anchor]]'', ''[[discern lies]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[endure elements]]'', ''[[freedom of movement]]'', ''[[invisibility purge]]'', ''[[protection from energy]]'', ''[[remove fear]]'', ''[[resist energy]]'', ''[[silence]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', and ''[[zone of truth]]''. This spell could only be changed or renewed by casting ''unhallow'' again.

==Components==
It required [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, and material components comprising [[herb]]s, [[incense]], and [[oil]]s. These should be worth at least 1000 [[gold piece]]s, with thousands more according to the power of spell included. Unlike ''hallow'', it did not need a [[divine focus]]. The spell took a full 24 hours to cast.
