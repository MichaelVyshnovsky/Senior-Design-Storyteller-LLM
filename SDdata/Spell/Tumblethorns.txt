Tumblethorns was an alteration spell that transformed a single plant thorn into a large mass of tangled thorns.
When cast, this spell changed the material component into a 2-foot-wide (0.6 meters) ball of long, intertwined thorns. This tumbleweed-like mass launched from the caster towards a single target person or creature. The tumblethorn slashed and pierced anyone who passed into its trajectory and impacted into its target.
Anyone who attempted to strike and destroy the tumblethorn in the middle of its flight was just as likely to be harmed as those that were targeted by the spell.
The specifications of this spell were inscribed upon the Talassan relic, the Chanting Chain.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the material component of a single thorn taken from any type of plant.
