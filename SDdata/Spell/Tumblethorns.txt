'''''Tumblethorns''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that transformed a single plant thorn into a large mass of tangled thorns.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell changed the [[material component]] into a 2-foot-wide (0.6 meters) ball of long, intertwined thorns. This tumbleweed-like mass launched from the caster towards a single target person or creature. The ''tumblethorn'' slashed and pierced anyone who passed into its trajectory and impacted into its target.

Anyone who attempted to strike and destroy the ''tumblethorn'' in the middle of its flight was just as likely to be harmed as those that were targeted by the spell.

==History==
The specifications of this spell were inscribed upon the [[Talassan]] [[relic]], the ''[[Chanting Chain]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the [[material component]] of a single thorn taken from any type of plant.
