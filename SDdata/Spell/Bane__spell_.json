        "mainbody": "Bane was an enchantment spell that sapped enemy morale and reduced their combat effectiveness.\nThose enemies cursed were inflicted with trepidation and doubt, lowering their morale and dulling their skill in combat.\nBane countered and dispelled bless and vice versa.\nAfter Second Sundering, the bane and bless spells didnt counter and dispel each other but were opposites of each other.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components, and the casters (un)holy symbol or divine focus."
