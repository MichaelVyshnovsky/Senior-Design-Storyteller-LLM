        "mainbody": "'''''Spiderbind''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Eilistraee]].",
        "Effects": "Similar to the ''[[slow]]'' spell, this spell made a targeted creature slower in their actions and reflexes. As the spell was developed to primarily target [[spiderkind]], it also protected against poisonous attacks.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]].",
        "History": "This spell was created by the [[Church of Eilistraee]] to defend its clerics against the spiderkind creatures who served [[Lolth]]."
