        "mainbody": "'''''Elemental guide''''' was a [[spell]] used commonly in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell resembled an elemental version of the ''[[unseen servant]]'' spell. Four distinct versions of this spell existedâ€”one for each element. Each version needed to be memorized separately from the others to cast. The summoned guide took different forms depending on which element was selected during the casting, appearing as either a small fiery sprite, a pet rock, a small puddle, or a [[dust devil]].\n\nThe summoned elemental guide prevented the caster from getting lost while traveling on the guide's native [[elemental plane]]. Successfully dispelling the guide would instantly destroy it. The guide would also disappear if sent more than 30 feet (9 m) from the caster. All of the elemental guides were physically weak creatures susceptible to a wide array of physical harm capable of destroying them.",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a [[gold]]en ball and mallet to cast. The ball and mallet were reusable for future castings. Since this spell could be cast for each of the four elements, a small amount of material for the desired element was also required. These could include a small lit candle, a handful of dust, vial of water, etc."
