        "mainbody": "Hellfire Storm was an evocation spell.\nBy casting hellfire storm, the caster caused an explosion similar to that caused by the hellfire spell. The difference was that it was more devastating, had a longer range, and the explosion had double the radius of the hellfire spell. This fire bypassed every kind of magical and other defenses against fire.\nHellfire storm required only verbal and somatic components.\nHellfire storm was a spell that was only available to people who had access to the Diabolic domain."
