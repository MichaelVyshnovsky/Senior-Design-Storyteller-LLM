Create darkness was an arcane alteration spell that extinguished all nonmagical light.
This spell could also extinguish light given off from magical sources if the source was unable to resist the spells magic. A normal light source affected by create darkness could not be relit for one hour, while magical sources stood a chance of being relit every ten minutes.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
This was an uncommon spell used by drow and other spellcasters of the Underdark.
