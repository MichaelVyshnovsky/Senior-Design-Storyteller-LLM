        "mainbody": "'''''Undead familiar''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by evil [[wizard]]s. This spell was found in ''[[Kyristan's Mysteries]]'' and was developed by the [[lich]] [[Kyristan]].",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed a particularly vile spellcaster to create a [[familiar]] out of any corpse, including those of [[humans]] and [[demihumans]]. The corpse could be in any state of decay. The created [[zombie]] or [[skeleton]] functioned like others of its kind but possessed minimal intelligence, allowing it to better serve the spellcaster. The spellcaster was able to issue mental commands at a distance of up to {{SI|1|mi|long=yes}} thanks to an empathic link with the ''undead familiar''.\n\nIf separated from the spellcaster for any reason the ''undead familiar'' began to slowly deteriorate until it was destroyed. Spellcasters possessed a strong bond with their ''undead familiar'', so if the familiar perished there was a small chance the caster would die as well, or at least suffer a permanent weakening of their vitality.\n\n''Undead familiars'' could be turned normally, but if within sight of the caster they were turned as if they were [[wight]]s. These familiars could not be destroyed by turning.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a corpse or skeleton and a [[silver]] ring placed on one of the familiar's fingers to cast."
