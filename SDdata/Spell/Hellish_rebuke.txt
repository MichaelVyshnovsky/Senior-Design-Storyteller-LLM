'''''Hellish rebuke''''' was a basic [[spell]] known to all [[warlock]]s of the [[Warlock#Infernal Pact Warlock|infernal pact]], and available to all warlocks after the [[Second Sundering]].

==Effects==
When cast, ''hellish rebuke'' caused a creature of the warlock's choosing within fifty feet of him or her to burst into flames channeled straight from the [[Nine Hells]] by the warlock's pain and rage. The intensity of the flames was, for the most part, determined by the capacity of the warlock themselves to take damage, and with more experience the spell grew in power substantially. As the most basic of all spells used by warlocks in the service of [[devil]]s during the [[Era of Upheaval]], ''hellish rebuke'' could be cast as many times per day as the warlock wished. 

In the years that followed, it could be cast a limited number of times per day, depending on the power of the warlock. During that time in history the spell had a range of about {{SI|60|ft}}.

When cast on [[Avernus]], the first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], the victim was also assaulted by the derisive laughter of [[imp]]s'' while the flames flickered.

==Components==
The spell needed only [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[Verbal component|verbal]] components to be cast.

==History==
After the [[Second Sundering]], warlocks of other pacts and sufficiently experienced [[tiefling]]s were able to cast the spell as well.
