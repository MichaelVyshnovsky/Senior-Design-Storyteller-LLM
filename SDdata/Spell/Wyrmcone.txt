'''''Wyrmcone''''' was an [[arcane]] spell that dealt damage depending on the [[material component]] used to cast it.

==Effects==
''Wyrmcone'', when cast, created a cone of {{SI|60'|'"|long=yes}} in length starting at the [[wizard]]'s hands. The come was filled with wildly whirling transparent dragon claws and sharp-toothed maws. The cone sliced and shredded everyone within its bounds and dealt damage dependent on the material component used.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and material components. The two material components for the spell were: a tiny glass or [[crystal]] cone and a small sliver of a [[dragon]]'s scale, tooth. bone, or claw. Different types of dragons changed the energy damage dealt with the spell: [[Black dragon|black]], [[Copper dragon|copper]], and [[green dragon]]s created a cone of [[acid]]; [[Blue dragon|blue]] and [[bronze dragon]]s - electricity; [[Brass dragon|brass]], [[Gold dragon|gold]], and [[red dragon]]s - fire; [[Silver dragon|silver]] and [[white dragon]]s - the cone of cold.

==History==
''Wyrmcone'' was among the spells that were exchanged between [[Elminster Aumar]], [[Mordenkainen]], and [[Rautheene]], during one of the regular meetings of [[the Wizards Three]] in the home of [[Ed Greenwood]] of [[Earth]]. The topic of discussion of that particular assembly was "battle spells."
