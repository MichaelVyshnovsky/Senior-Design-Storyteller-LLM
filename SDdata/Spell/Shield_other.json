        "mainbody": "Shield other was an abjuration spell that created a protective barrier around another creature and the caster shared any injury received by the target creature.\nThis spell increased the target creatures resistance to injury, both magical and physical, but half the damage successfully inflicted on the target was felt by the caster instead. This transference did not apply to death effects, charm effects, or life-experience loss effects. The target and the caster had to stay within the range of the spell (30 ft or 9.1 m for beginning casters) or the connection was broken and the spell ended.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required two platinum rings (valued at least 50 gp each) to be worn by the caster and the target creature. These rings were foci and were not consumed in the casting of the spell."
