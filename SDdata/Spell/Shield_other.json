        "mainbody": "'''''Shield other''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that created a protective barrier around another creature and the caster shared any injury received by the target creature.",
        "Effects": "This spell increased the target creature's resistance to injury, both magical and physical, but half the damage successfully inflicted on the target was felt by the caster instead. This transference did not apply to death effects, ''[[charm]]'' effects, or life-experience loss effects. The target and the caster had to stay within the range of the spell (30 ft or 9.1 m for beginning casters) or the connection was broken and the spell ended.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required two [[platinum]] rings (valued at least 50 [[gp]] each) to be worn by the caster and the target creature. These rings were foci and were not consumed in the casting of the spell."
