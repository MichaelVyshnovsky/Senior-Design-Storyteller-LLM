        "mainbody": "A '''''wand of wonder''''' was an unpredictable [[magic item|magical]] [[wand]] that produced a random effect each time it was used.",
        "Powers": "The wand could be aimed at a creature, an object, or any point in space. Activating the wand caused it to create a random effect that could possibly target the wielder, the pointed creature or object, or an area in front of the wand. It could be activated up to seven times a day, after which it gradually recovered its powers at dawn on subsequent days. If all the power of a ''wand of wonder'' was used up in a single day, there was a small chance that it would crumble to dust and be destroyed.\n\nThe ''wand of wonder'' was capable of producing a number of different outcomes, each with a different probability to happen. They included casting [[spell]]s that affected a single creature, such as ''[[detect thoughts]]'', ''[[enlarge/reduce]]'', ''[[flesh to stone]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', and ''[[slow]]''; spells that affected an entire area, such as ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[gust of wind]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', and ''[[stinking cloud]]''; and other effects, such as turning the wielder's skin blue, summoning a large animal or a swarm of [[butterfly|butterflies]], making grass or leaves grow, causing rain, stunning the wielder, banishing objects into the [[Ethereal plane]], and creating a violent burst of either [[gem]]s or colorful light, among others.",
        "Notable ''Wands of Wonder''": "A ''wand of wonder'' was created by a whimsical wizard named [[Malimak]] sometime before [[1369 DR]], as a gift prank for his rival. The outcomes of the prank were unknown as Malimak moved away soon after the gift was made.\n\nThe [[wizard]] [[Rantantar]], one of [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s oldest apprentices, bound his spirit to his ''wand of wonder'' after his death. The spirit could animate and discharge the wand at random creatures.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[File:Wand wonder WoW.png|thumb|Coriolis Rillevay's ''wand of wonder''.]]\n* [[Jim Darkmagic]]\n* [[Red (leprechaun)|Red]]: a [[leprechaun]] [[wizard]] on a quest for [[gold]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1992|219|Red}}\n* [[Rantantar]]\n* [[Coriolis Rillevay]], a [[gnome]] [[sorcerer]] from [[Waterdeep]] active in the late 15{{th}} century DR."
