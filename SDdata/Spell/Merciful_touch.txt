Merciful touch was a spell used by clerics of Sharindlar.
A caster used this spell to not only heal injuries, but to alleviate pain and suffering. So if the spell was unable to cure a disease or completely heal an injury, it would ease the symptoms or pain from said conditions for up to a full day. Merciful touch also negated the effects of certain spells such as irritation. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, the holy symbol of Sharindlar.
