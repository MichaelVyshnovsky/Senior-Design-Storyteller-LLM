'''''Mount''''', which was originally called '''''Jarm's mount''''', was a [[Conjuration#Subschools|summoning]] [[spell]] to conjure an equine to carry a rider.

==Effects==
To within close range of the caster, this spell summoned a [[pony]] or light [[horse]], which was willing an able to carry a rider. The mount was summoned with riding gear, such as [[bit and bridle]] and [[saddle]], already equipped. The duration of the summons depended on the power of the spellcaster but was at least two hours.

==Components==
A strand of horse hair was required to cast this spell, in addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.

==History==
The spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Jarm]]  in {{Yearlink|-1964}}.

In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''mount'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}
