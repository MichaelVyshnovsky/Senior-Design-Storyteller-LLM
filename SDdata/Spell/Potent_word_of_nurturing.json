        "mainbody": "'''''Potent word of nurturing''''' was an advanced [[utterance]] from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind that used [[truespeak]] to rejuvenate a target from its wounds, or to rend them apart, if reversed.",
        "Usage": "In its straight form, healing energy suffused the target, slowly repairing them of a massive amount of damage. In its reversed form, it rended and tore at the target's connection to its body, dealing grievous wounds. It could last for an instant, but with some concentration, damage would be doubled after a few seconds.",
        "History": "The utterance was known to [[logokron devil]]s, [[garbler]]s, who used only the reversed form, and [[loquasphinx]]es.{{cite book/Tome of Magic 3.5|265-266,299}}"
