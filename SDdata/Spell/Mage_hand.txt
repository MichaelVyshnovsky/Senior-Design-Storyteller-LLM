Mage hand was a transmutation cantrip that allowed a caster to manipulate an object some distance away from themself.
On casting mage hand, the caster pointed at an object and move it  in any direction. A magical, ghost-like hand was conjured, which could be used to interact with objects weighing  or less. The hand had the equivalent speed of a human and could easily drop items or, given a moment, pick up new ones. The mage could keep the hand conjured for up to a minute per cast.
When cast on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells, the hand looked like a fiendish claw.
Casting mage hand required somatic and verbal components.
Before the Spellplague, though mage hand could only be cast a limited number of times per day during this era, its effects were otherwise similar.
* Arcane tricksters A profession that could only be picked up by people who were capable of casting mage hand.
