Bone club was an arcane spell from the schools of necromancy and enchantment that allowed a wizard to transform a regular bone into a magical weapon.
The spell lasted for several minutes depending on the skill of the caster.
In addition to verbal components, this spell required as material components a bone such as a femur and pinch of dirt from a grave to cast.
This spell was found within the Book of Shadows, a tome based upon the oration of the necromancer Nebt Bhakau of Zakhara.
