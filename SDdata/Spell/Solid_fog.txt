Solid fog, formerly known as Veridons solidifier, was a conjuration or alteration spell that created a tangible fog.
Solid fog could be cast by sorcerers and wizards.
Functioning like its precursor fog cloud, the solid fog spell caused a cloud of fog to emanate from the point of origin, obscuring sight and concealing those within.
It was also so dense that it slowed all movement within, forcing all creatures to a crawling pace and hindering both melee and ranged weapons, bar magic rays. It could even slow the descent of something falling through it.
The solid fog would dissipate as a normal fog in a severe wind, and could not be cast underwater.
A permanency spell made a solid fog permanent and continually reforming.
A casting of solid fog required a mixture of a pinch of powdered hoof from some animal, and a pinch of powdered dried peas.
The spell was created by the arcanist Veridon of Netheril, ruler of the enclave of Lathery. He introduced it in 3408 NY (−451 DR) under the name Veridons solidifier. It later became known simply as solid fog.
Solid fog was an uncommon spell in Faerûn in the 1360s DR.
