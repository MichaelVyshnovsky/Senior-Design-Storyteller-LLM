'''''Solid fog''''', formerly known as '''''Veridon's solidifier''''', was a [[conjuration]] or [[alteration]] [[spell]] that created a tangible fog.

==Users==
''Solid fog'' could be cast by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
Functioning like its precursor ''fog cloud'', the ''solid fog'' spell caused a cloud of fog to emanate from the point of origin, obscuring sight and concealing those within.

It was also so dense that it slowed all movement within, forcing all creatures to a crawling pace and hindering both melee and ranged weapons, bar magic rays. It could even slow the descent of something falling through it.

The ''solid fog'' would dissipate as a normal fog in a severe wind, and could not be cast underwater.

A ''[[permanency]]'' spell made a ''solid fog'' permanent and continually reforming.

==Components==
A casting of ''solid fog'' required a mixture of a pinch of powdered hoof from some animal, and a pinch of powdered dried [[pea]]s.

==History==
The spell was created by the [[arcanist]] [[Veridon]] of [[Netheril]], ruler of the enclave of [[Lathery]]. He introduced it in [[-451 DR|3408 NY (−451 DR)]] under the name ''Veridon's solidifier''. It later became known simply as ''solid fog''.

''Solid fog'' was an uncommon spell in [[Faerûn]] in the 1360s [[DR]].
