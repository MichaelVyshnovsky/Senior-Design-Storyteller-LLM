        "mainbody": "'''''Higher consecration''''' was a rare [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s. It's use was recorded by [[Volothamp Geddarm]].",
        "Effects": "This spell was used to dedicate an item to the service of whichever [[deity]] the caster served. The item was cleansed of any holy, or unholy, influences. If the spell failed, the item either turned to dust or burst into flame, destroying it. If successfully cast, the item levitate for a short time and glowed with a blue-white light.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required several [[material component]]s. It required the [[holy symbol]] of the caster, a single spark from a flint striking a piece of [[iron]], a small amount of dirt from a dung heap that bears plants, a single drop of [[holy water]], a single drop of unholy water and a vial containing air from a chamber in which a [[dragon]] recently used its breath weapon. The flint and iron were consumed by the spell."
