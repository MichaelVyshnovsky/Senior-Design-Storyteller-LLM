        "mainbody": "Higher consecration was a rare spell used by clerics. Its use was recorded by Volothamp Geddarm.\nThis spell was used to dedicate an item to the service of whichever deity the caster served. The item was cleansed of any holy, or unholy, influences. If the spell failed, the item either turned to dust or burst into flame, destroying it. If successfully cast, the item levitate for a short time and glowed with a blue-white light.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required several material components. It required the holy symbol of the caster, a single spark from a flint striking a piece of iron, a small amount of dirt from a dung heap that bears plants, a single drop of holy water, a single drop of unholy water and a vial containing air from a chamber in which a dragon recently used its breath weapon. The flint and iron were consumed by the spell."
