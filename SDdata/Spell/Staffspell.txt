Staffspell was an arcane evocation spell from the third circle of magic that summoned a magical quarterstaff to be used in battle.
When the spell was cast, it created a magical  staff made out of electricity in the wizards hands. The staff glowed at the casters mental command and could be used as a source of light akin to the light spell. Additionally, the staffs damage was magical, similar to a +1 enchantment that increased in power as the spellcasters magic prowess grew. The staffspell could not be passed onto another user and could only be wielded by the caster. When wielded against creatures made of water or of aquatic nature, the damage inflicted with the weapon was doubled.
This spell required verbal, somatic, and material components to cast. The material component was a small wooden rod cut from an oak tree by the caster.
The spell was recorded in The Blue Book of Othyisar DuMorde Vol.I, not surprisingly, penned by archmage evoker Othyisar DuMorde from mountains in the northeast of Calimshan.
