        "mainbody": "'''''Detect curse''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[divination]] spell of the [[southern magic]] tradition that allowed the caster to examine artifacts or creatures for the presence of a [[curse]].{{Southernmagic}} A variant of this spell was used by [[shugenja]] and was very rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Effects": "This spell had a maximum range of 10 yd (9.1 m) and only detected divinely inspired curses&mdash;items with dangerous enchantments on them were not considered cursed for the purposes of this spell. With sufficient experience, a priest could determine the specific type of curse, such as from a ''[[bestow curse]]'' spell, a ''[[Bane (spell)|bane]]'', a ''[[dying curse]]'', or a ''[[bestow major curse|major curse]]'' spell. For one version of this spell, it took one minute to examine an object or a creature and the spell lasted for several minutes, so the caster could examine other targets until the spell expired.  The effects of the spell used by shugenja were identical.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. In Kara-Tur, a shugenja required \n[[material component]]s to cast the spell. The shugenja gave an offering to their [[deity]], a gem worth at least 2 [[ch'ien]], as well as a cluster of fresh flowers from a [[cherry]] or [[plum]] tree."
