        "mainbody": "Detect curse was a divine divination spell of the southern magic tradition that allowed the caster to examine artifacts or creatures for the presence of a curse. A variant of this spell was used by shugenja and was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThis spell had a maximum range of 10 yd (9.1 m) and only detected divinely inspired curses&mdashitems with dangerous enchantments on them were not considered cursed for the purposes of this spell. With sufficient experience, a priest could determine the specific type of curse, such as from a bestow curse spell, a bane, a dying curse, or a major curse spell. For one version of this spell, it took one minute to examine an object or a creature and the spell lasted for several minutes, so the caster could examine other targets until the spell expired.  The effects of the spell used by shugenja were identical.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast. In Kara-Tur, a shugenja required \nmaterial components to cast the spell. The shugenja gave an offering to their deity, a gem worth at least 2 chien, as well as a cluster of fresh flowers from a cherry or plum tree."
