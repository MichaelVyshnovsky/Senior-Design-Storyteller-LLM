}}'''''Laeral's cutting hand''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell modified the structure of the caster's hand so it acted like a bladed weapon. It caused the same damage as a regular bladed weapon. Although the caster was unable to use this hand for casting spells that used a somatic component, they were able to use it normally otherwise.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
