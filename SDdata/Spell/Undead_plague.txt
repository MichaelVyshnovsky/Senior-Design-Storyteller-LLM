'''''Undead plague''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[necromancy]] [[quest spell]] from the [[necromantic sphere]] that allowed the caster to summon many ranks of [[skeleton]]s to do their bidding.

==Effects==
The skeletons from this small army were formed from the bones of any creatures within the spell's area of effect that extended for thousands of feet from the caster. A maximum of 1,000 skeletons could be summoned with ''undead plague''. The skeletons remained to serve the caster until dismissed by the caster or destroyed.

==Components==
This spell did not require [[spell component]]s of any kind to cast.

==History==
The ''[[Nycoptic Manuscripts]]'', a pair of ancient [[scroll]]s predicting the release of the [[lich]] [[Vermissa]] on the island of [[Sahu]] in [[Zakhara]], contained the ''undead plague'' spell.
