Undead plague was a divine necromancy quest spell from the necromantic sphere that allowed the caster to summon many ranks of skeletons to do their bidding.
The skeletons from this small army were formed from the bones of any creatures within the spells area of effect that extended for thousands of feet from the caster. A maximum of 1,000 skeletons could be summoned with undead plague. The skeletons remained to serve the caster until dismissed by the caster or destroyed.
This spell did not require spell components of any kind to cast.
The Nycoptic Manuscripts, a pair of ancient scrolls predicting the release of the lich Vermissa on the island of Sahu in Zakhara, contained the undead plague spell.
