        "Effects": "This spell created a pillar of [[sand]] that rose into the air, carrying any target into the sky. This spell would only work in a sandy region. The top of the pillar was a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} circle centered on the target. The caster could make the pillar rise as high as the available sand would allow by volume based on the caster's power. The pillar could be attacked and destroyed by normal or magical means, collapsing it instantly in the case of destruction. The caster could collapse the pillar at any time.",
        "Components": "This spell required enough nearby sand to create the pillar in order to cast."
