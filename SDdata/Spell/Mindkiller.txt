'''''Mindkiller''''' was a powerful [[divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] and [[necromancy]] [[spell]] from the [[thought sphere|thought]] and [[necromantic sphere]]s that placed the subject's personality into stasis, effectively turning them into a mindless automaton.

==Effects==
Once under the control of the spell, the subject would follow any telepathic commands issued by the caster regardless of any language barriers. [[Elf]] and [[half-elf]] [[magic resistance]] did not apply to the ''mindkiller'' spell. The caster could see the world through the subject's eyes while the spell was active. The subject's personality remained in stasis for the duration of the spell or until the caster released it, or a ''[[wish]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'' or specific ''[[heal]]'' spell was used. The caster's control ceased if the subject's body died. The death also wracked the caster with intense pain that had the potential drive them insane.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a [[gemstone]] worth at least 500 [[gp]] to cast. The gemstone was consumed during the casting.

==History==
''Mindkiller'' was included within the ''[[Testament of Vraer]]'', a [[spellbook]] written by a [[cleric]] of [[Kelemvor]] named [[Vraer]].
