'''''Read thoughts''''' was a ''channel divinity'' power granted to [[cleric]]s who chose the [[Knowledge domain]].

==Effects==
When using this power, the cleric could attempt to gain access to the surface thoughts of a creature within 60 ft (18.3 m), similarly to a ''[[detect thoughts]]'' spell. If successful, the cleric could then command the creature for up to one minute, effectively putting the creature under the effects of a ''[[suggestion]]'' spell. Afterwards, the creature became immune to attempts coming from the same cleric until the next day.

As the cleric progressed and became more powerful, this power became more difficult to resist.
