'''''Permanency prayer''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[creation sphere]] that rendered an enchantment upon an inanimate item ''[[Permanency|permanent]]''.

==Effects==
This spell had no effect upon living creatures. The casting [[priest]] touched the item and their [[holy symbol]] while praying to their [[god]] to make the enchantment permanent. The spell stood a better chance of succeeding if the casting priest was in favor of their god and the item was placed upon a sacred altar. The casting of ''permanency prayer'' was incredibly physically taxing for the caster, resulting in a permanent loss of vitality.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.

==History==
''Permanency prayer'' was an extremely rare spell according to [[Volothamp Geddarm]].
