        "mainbody": "Rapport was a divine alteration spell from the thought sphere that was an improved version of telepathy.\nRapport allowed the casting priest to communicate silently and instantly with a willing subject. Both participants could also share deeper thoughts, including memories and emotions, than what was possible through telepathy. The participants could also experience everything the other sensed through all five senses. The casting priest could establish multiple connections with rapport, but each new connection required a new casting of the spell.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThe Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the Mystran faith, could cast the rapport spell."
