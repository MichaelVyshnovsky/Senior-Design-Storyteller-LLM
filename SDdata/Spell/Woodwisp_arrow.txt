Woodwisp arrow was a transmutation spell that gave an arrow the ability to pass through wood.
The spell allowed the arrow to pass through wood as if it were moving through air. It only transformed the properties of the arrow, and did not allow the caster to see through wooden objects or trees. The arrow had to be loosed from a bow within seconds of the spells casting or the magic would expire and there was no effect.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required an arrow of masterwork quality.
