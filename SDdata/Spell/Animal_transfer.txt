Animal transfer was a divine spell available to worshipers of Malar.
When cast, this spell allowed the caster to gain complete control over an animals mind, which was suppressed for the duration of the spell. The caster had full control over the body and full uses of the animals abilities and senses. The spell did not allow a caster to take control of another individuals animal companion. 
While the spell was in effect, the casters body remained motionless as if in a coma. Due to this vulnerability, the caster choose a safe location or had their body guarded before casting this spell. If the animal dies while the spell was in effect, the casters mind returned to their body. If the casters body was killed, their mind remained trapped in the animal until the animal perished of natural causes, was killed, or a wish spell was used to aid the caster.
This spell required only somatic and verbal components.
