'''''Animal growth''''' was a [[transmutation]] or [[alteration]] spell that allowed the caster to double the size of one or more animals. The reverse of this spell, '''''shrink animal''''', caused animals to shrink to half their size.

==Effects==
Casting this spell caused one or more animals to grow in size. This doubled each animal's height, length, and width, while increasing its weight by a factor of eight. This increase in size had a number of effects including making the creature more powerful but it also made the creature easier to attack. The creature's strength and hardiness were also increased. This spell did not affect Colossal sized creatures, although the reverse of this spell could.

When the spell ended, the creature's size and power returned to normal, and any injuries suffered by the creature were reduced in severity by half.

The caster gained no special ability to command or influence the affected animals.

==Components==
The older version of this spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell also required a [[material component]], a bite of food. The newer version did not require any food.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Stoca]] in {{Yearlink|-1794}} and was originally called ''Stoca's fauna grow''.

It was recorded in ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy text of the [[church of Mielikki]].<ref>
