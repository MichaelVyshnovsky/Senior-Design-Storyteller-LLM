}}'''''Spook''''', originally known as '''''Carbury's spook''''', was a rare [[spell]] in the Realms.

==Effects==
Upon casting on a single creature up to 30 ft (9.1 m) away, the ''spook'' spell enabled the caster to play upon its fears. Unless the target resisted the spell, the creature would turn and flee away from the caster at their maximum pace. Although the caster didn't actually run after the creature, a phantasm of the victim's mind did. It only affected creatures with at least some intelligence, and had no effect against undead.

==Components==
The spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components.

==History==
The spell was invented by the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Carbury]] in {{Yearlink|-863}}.
