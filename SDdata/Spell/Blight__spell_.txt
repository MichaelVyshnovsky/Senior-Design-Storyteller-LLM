'''Blight''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that bathed a creature or plant with necromantic energy.

==Effects==
The spell would effectively drain water and vitality from a creature, which would suffer serious necrotic damage. [[Undead]] and [[construct]]s were immune as they either didn't have or didn't need moisture. Plants would just wither and die unless they were plant creatures or a magical plant, in which case they would just have a disadvantage to resist the spell, If they failed, they would suffer the full damage of the spell. The strength of the necromantic damage inflicted onto a target is determined by the caster's skill level.

==Components==
The spell had verbal and somatic components.<ref group="note">In ''[[Player's Handbook v.3.5]]'', this spell also required a [[divine focus]].
