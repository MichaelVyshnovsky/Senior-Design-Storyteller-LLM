        "mainbody": "Insect sight was a very rare wizards spell that granted a creature insect-like all-around eyesight for a limited time.\nWhen the spell was cast, the wizard touched a creature, granting them a sight similar to that of an insect, with an almost full 360 degrees of field of view. This allowed the ensorcelled creature not to be surprised by a sneak attack.\nInsect sight required 12 seconds to cast, and its effect lasted for 30 seconds at its weakest, and the spells duration grew along with the spell-casters magical prowess.\nTunnel vision was insect sights reverse spell, and it reduced a creatures field of vision to 10 degrees. It granted them protection against gaze-based magical attacks and abilities but made them vulnerable to stealing and surprise attacks.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and material components to be cast. Its material components were sunblossom oil and the dried remains of ten flies.\nTo cast tunnel vision, the caster needed to use nightflower sap and an earthworm.\nIn the 14 century DR, insect sight was recorded in Prismals Pocket Library, Vol.IV. until the shops destruction in the late 14 century DR. At some point, one of Prismals spellbook that contained insect sight left Toril. The books original name was If They Can Do It, Prismal Can Do It Two it was filled with Prismals hand-written notes. It ended up in the hands of several spell dealers on the world of Nehwon where the city of Lankhmar was located."
