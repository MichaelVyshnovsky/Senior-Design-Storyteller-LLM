        "mainbody": "'''''Insect sight''''' was a very rare [[wizard]]'s [[spell]] that granted a creature insect-like all-around eyesight for a limited time.",
        "Effects": "When the spell was cast, the wizard touched a creature, granting them a sight similar to that of an insect, with an almost full 360 degrees of field of view. This allowed the ensorcelled creature not to be surprised by a sneak attack.\n\n''Insect sight'' required 12 seconds to cast, and its effect lasted for 30 seconds at its weakest, and the spell's duration grew along with the spell-caster's magical prowess.\n\n''Tunnel vision'' was ''insect sight''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> reverse spell, and it reduced a creature's field of vision to 10 degrees. It granted them protection against gaze-based magical attacks and abilities but made them vulnerable to stealing and surprise attacks.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s to be cast. Its material components were [[sunblossom oil]] and the dried remains of ten [[flies]].\n\nTo cast ''tunnel vision'', the caster needed to use [[nightflower]] sap and an [[earthworm]].",
        "History": "In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''insect sight'' was recorded in ''[[Prismal's Pocket Library, Vol.IV]]''.{{Cite polyhedron/63/Chemcheaux|26}} until the shop's destruction in the late 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite polyhedron/105/The Ravens Bluff Trumpeter|32}} At some point, one of Prismal's ''[[spellbook]]'' that contained ''insect sight'' left [[Toril]]. The book's original name was ''[[If They Can Do It, Prismal Can Do It Two]]''; it was filled with Prismal's hand-written notes. It ended up in the hands of several spell dealers on the world of [[Nehwon]] where the city of [[Lankhmar]] was located."
