        "mainbody": "Lesser shadow tentacle was arcane, abjuration spell that summoned a giant, rope-like tentacle made existing shadows that fell upon an area.\nThe spell would animate shadows from an existing anchor point and extend out, up to 50 (15.2m) and ensnare a target. The shadows would hold a creature down, preventing it from moving away, or if so desired, slowing it considerably. The affected creature could free itself from the shadows hold with some considerable effort or great strength.\nThe shadow tentacles were not affected by natural or magical light.\nLesser shadow tentacles required only somatic components.\nThe Sharran monkish Order of the Dark Moon often used this spell. In fact, when these sorcerers arcane capabilities grew to levels that they could handle the spell, it was taught to them. It did not deplete the sorcerers ability to cast additional spells for it was a gift from Shar."
