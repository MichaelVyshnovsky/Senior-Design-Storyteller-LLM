        "mainbody": "Detect ambush was a southern magic divine spell available to worshipers of Anhur.\nWhen cast, the spell allowed the caster to detect the presence of any creature in the area lying in wait to ambush the caster or their party. The spell was unable to detect the presence of traps, nor did it detect the presence of a creature who would do the caster harm at some point in the future.\nThe reverse of this spell, undetectable ambush, allowed the caster to remain undetected while waiting to ambush a target.\nIn addition to somatic and verbal components, this spell required a material component, any possession from any of the casters enemies."
