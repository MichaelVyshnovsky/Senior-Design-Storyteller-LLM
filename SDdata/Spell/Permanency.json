        "mainbody": "'''''Permanency''''' was a [[universal spell]] that made the effects of specific other [[spell]]s permanent.",
        "Effect": "To achieve this, the caster simply cast the chosen spell and then cast the ''permanency'' spell immediately after. Moreover, the ''permanency'' only functioned for specific spells and the caster needed to have achieved a specific level of power with them. Casting ''permanency'' was personally taxing, permanently sapping the caster's energy and experiences.\n\nFirst, the caster could make these spells permanent when cast on him- or herself: ''[[arcane sight]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[darkvision (spell)|darkvision]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', and ''[[tongues]]''. These permanent spells could be [[dispel magic|dispelled]], but only by a more powerful spellcaster (compared to the caster at the time of casting ''permanency'').\n\nSecond, the caster could make permanent on themself, a different creature, or an item the following spells, according to their function: ''[[enlarge person]]'', ''[[magic fang]]'', ''[[greater magic fang]]'', ''[[Rary's telepathic bond]]'' (only two creatures at a time), ''[[reduce person]]'', and ''[[resistance]]''. These could be dispelled as normal.\n\nFinally, these spells that applied to items or areas could also be made permanent: ''[[alarm]]'', ''[[animate objects]]'', ''[[dancing lights]]'', ''[[ghost sound]]'', ''[[gust of wind]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[magic mouth]]'', ''[[Mordenkainen's private sanctum]]'', ''[[phase door]]'', ''[[prismatic sphere]]'', ''[[prismatic wall]]'', ''[[shrink item]]'', ''[[solid fog]]'', ''[[stinking cloud]]'', ''[[symbol of death]]'', ''[[symbol of fear]]'', ''[[symbol of insanity]]'', ''[[symbol of pain]]'', ''[[symbol of persuasion]]'', ''[[symbol of sleep]]'', ''[[symbol of stunning]]'', ''[[symbol of weakness]]'', ''[[teleportation circle]]'', ''[[wall of fire]]'', ''[[wall of force]]'', and ''[[web]]''. These could be dispelled as normal.\n\nIt was possible to find other spells that could be made permanent, though the research was as time-consuming and costly as inventing the spell itself.",
        "History": "The [[Simbul]] had found a way to use ''permanency'' to place ''[[protection from evil]]'' on herself, despite the original spell's limitation."
