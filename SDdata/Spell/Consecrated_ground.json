        "mainbody": "Consecrated ground was a daily prayer available to clerics during the post-Spellplague era that temporarily consecrated an area with radiant energy.\nThrough prayer a cleric casting consecrated ground caused jagged and crackling lines of radiant light to spread across an area of ground of their choosing, moving in a web-like manner. Consecrated ground could be sustained by the caster and while active the area of effect could be moved to anywhere within  of the ground that was originally consecrated. Any enemy that stood within the area would be harmed by the radiant energy emanating from the ground, while any injured allies would be moderately healed.\nIn the , a party of four Daggerdalesmen adventurers were summoned to the mines of Tethyamar by the Banite priestess Lorin-Aria to kill the Zhent wizard Rezlus and put an end to his plans to conquer Daggerdale and the greater Dalelands region. Among this party of adventurers was a dwarf cleric who knew the prayer consecrated ground."
