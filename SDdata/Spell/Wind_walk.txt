Wind walk was a transmutation or alteration spell.
This spell changed the caster and possibly a few companions into clouds of misty vapor and could travel very rapidly, borne by a magical breeze. When viewed by an individual not affected by the spell, the caster resembled a cloud of fog.
A caster could use this spell to travel between two atmospheres in wildspace, but did not bring any breathable air with them. If the spell expired while they were still in wildspace, they became adrift.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The materials required were fire and holy water.
