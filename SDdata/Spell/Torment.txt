'''Torment''' was a powerful [[arcane magic|arcane]] [[alteration]] and [[evocation]] [[spell]] that forced obedience from a creature from another [[plane of existence]].

==Effects==
This spell created a link between the caster and the target creature. The caster then continued to read from a specially prepared writing which caused the creature an increasing amount of discomfort and pain. These physical symptoms would continue until the creature submitted to the [[wizard]]'s complete control.

The special writing needed for this spell to function required the target creatures secret name.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a specially prepared writing to cast. The writings were penned with ink worth a small fortune.

==History==
This spell was created and used by [[Iggwilv]].{{Cite dragon/336/Spellcraft: The Demonomicon of Iggwilv|76-84}}
