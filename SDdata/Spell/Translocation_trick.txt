Translocation trick was a transmutation spell used by wizards and sorcerers.
This spell allowed the caster to switch locations and change appearances with a target creature of similar size with the caster. The disguise held until the spell expired, at which point the caster and target changed positions and appearances back to normal.
This spell required only verbal components to cast.
