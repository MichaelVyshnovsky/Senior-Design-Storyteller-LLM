Elevate I was a spell unique to Maztica.
When cast, this spell elevated an object crafted with featherweaving into the air. The maximum weight of the object and maximum height it can float was determined by the casters skill level. The caster was able to move the object around while it was floating.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
