'''''Summon spirit''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. Although the spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur, some [[necromancer]]s in [[Faer√ªn]] knew the spell.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell summoned any spirit. To be successful, the caster was required to know the spirit being summoned. The summoned spirit appeared before the caster and if the caster was a helpful individual, the spirit was friendly. The spirit was not compelled to obey the caster; the spirit offered advice or assisted the caster by their own free will. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: a burning stick of [[incense]] and a gift that the spirit appreciated.
