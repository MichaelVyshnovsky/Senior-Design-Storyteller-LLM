}}'''''Wind compass''''' was a [[spell]] used by wizards in [[Anauroch]] and [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
This spell created a small moaning wind in the caster's ear that only he or she could hear. The caster chose a direction and whenever their ear faced that direction they would hear a steady tone. Moving the ear from the selected direction raised or lowered the pitch of the tone. This spell lasted for several hours based on the caster's power.

==Components==
This spell required a bit of earth mixed with spittle to cast.
