        "mainbody": "Scale shift was an alteration spell that allowed a dragon to change the color of their scales to those of another type of dragon. It was a rather unpopular spell among the dragons of Toril as many of their kind drew considerable pride from their specific species.\nWhen this spell was cast, the scales of the casting dragon shifted to those of another type of dragon within their shared classification. There was a distinct limit to this effect, as chromatic dragons could not change the hue of their scales to resemble a metallic dragon and vice versa.\nWhile this spell did change the color of a dragons scales, it did not alter their form in any other manner. The change was fairly convincing and could disguise the dragon from the identification of casual observers and those who were uneducated in the specifics of dragonology. Other dragons would seldom misidentify one of their own who was under the effects of scale shift."
