        "mainbody": "'''''Scale shift''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[dragon]] to change the color of their scales to those of another type of dragon. It was a rather unpopular spell among the dragons of [[Toril]] as many of their kind drew considerable pride from their specific species.",
        "Effects": "When this spell was cast, the scales of the casting dragon shifted to those of another type of dragon within their shared classification. There was a distinct limit to this effect, as [[chromatic dragon]]s could not change the hue of their scales to resemble a [[metallic dragon]] and vice versa.\n\nWhile this spell did change the color of a dragon's scales, it did not alter their form in any other manner. The change was fairly convincing and could disguise the dragon from the identification of casual observers and those who were uneducated in the specifics of dragonology. Other dragons would seldom misidentify one of their own who was under the effects of ''scale shift''."
