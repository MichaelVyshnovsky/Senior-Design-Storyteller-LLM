        "mainbody": "'''''Unseen aid''''' was a [[spell]] used by many [[sorcerer]]s during their initial training. Using ''unseen aid'' granted [[arcane]] assistance to the caster, allowing them to perform a number of tasks with greater proficiency than they would otherwise be able to. ''Unseen aid'' was not particularly difficult to cast, taking only an instance to use and a rest of a few minutes or more to recharge."
