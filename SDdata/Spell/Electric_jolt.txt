Electric jolt was a simple arcane evocation cantrip used by spellcasters in the Forgotten Realms to create a small jolt of electricity from their fingertips.
The jolt could be aimed at a target up to 25 feet away (or further, depending on the skill of the caster), but it did not produce a very powerful shock.
This spell required both verbal and somatic components.
