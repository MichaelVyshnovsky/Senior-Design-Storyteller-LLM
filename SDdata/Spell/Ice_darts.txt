Ice darts was an arcane conjuration spell that hurled darts of ice at close targets.
The spell threw icicle-shaped darts at targets. Some of the damage was from the physical impact, but the rest was due to severe elemental cold. Up to five darts could be produced and launched by an experienced caster.
The spell had verbal and somatic components.
