Shadow hand was an illusion spell that would conjure a translucent, billowy hand that obeyed the will of the caster.
The shadowy hand had to stay within a number of yards of the caster, depending on their level. 
Shadow hand was capable of providing cover, much like Bigbys interposing hand, as well as capable of carrying materials, much like Tensers floating disk.
It had no effect on the undead, golems, constructs, creatures from the outer planes, and primitive non-vertebrates (such as oozes, slimes, and non-intelligent plants).
This spell was created by the wizard named Jume several hundred years before the Time of Troubles and recorded in her personal spellbook, the Arcanabula of Jume.
