        "mainbody": "'''''Eldritch speed''''' is a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] used by several inexperienced [[swordmage]]s. When it is cast, ''eldritch speed'' allows a swordmage to infuse their body with [[magic]]al power, quickening both their mental and physical reactive capability. Swordmages enhanced by the ''eldritch speed'' react to danger more quickly and can run twice as fast. ''Eldritch speed'' is a difficult spell, however, and can only be cast once per day.",
