Sanctuary was an abjuration spell that could prevent enemies from attacking the subject for a few minutes on the condition that the subject does not take direct offensive action.
This spell protected the touched individual from any targeted attack, either melee, ranged weapon, or spell, unless the attacker was able to overcome the sanctuary by force of will. If the first attack failed to get past the sanctuary, then no subsequent attack by that enemy on the subject would succeed for the duration of the spell. This spell did not protect against area-effect attacks, such as fireball. As long as the subject did not directly attack an enemy, he or she could perform non-aggressive actions such as casting bless, healing, divination, or even summoning creatures (such creatures may attack on the summoners behalf).
The older versions of this spell actually made a failed attacker totally ignore the subject for the duration of the spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of the casters holy symbol or divine focus. The older versions of sanctuary also required a small silver mirror as a material component.
