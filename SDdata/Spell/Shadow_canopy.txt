'''''Shadow canopy''''' was an [[evocation]] spell of darkness used by the [[Shadovar]] to protect excavation sites.

==Effects==
The spell created a flat dome of [[shadowstuff]] 25 feet (eight meters) above the ground and with a radius of at least 325 feet (99 meters), depending on the power of the caster.

It was impossible to see through the dome with natural vision, and even a creature using the magic of ''[[blacklight]]'' could not see through it. This allowed creatures such as [[shade]]s or [[vampire]]s to exist quite happily, even if it was broad daylight outside of the dome.

It took at least six seconds to cast this spell, and the effect lasted at least eleven hours.

The dome could be centered above the ground anywhere within a couple hundred feet (60 meters) of the caster but could not be cast higher than the ground to create a sphere, nor could the center of its effect be placed upon a moving object.

A ''shadow canopy'' spell could dispel any light spell of lesser or equal power. Light spells of equal power could not dispel a shadow canopy effect; only a more powerful light spell could.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s and the dried eyeball of any [[wikipedia:en:Diurnality|diurnal]] creature and a handful of coal dust, both of which were consumed in the casting.

==Notable Users==
Every Shadovar expedition included an [[arcanist]] powerful enough to cast this spell.
