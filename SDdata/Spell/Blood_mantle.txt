Blood mantle was a divine alteration and necromancy spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Garagos called Bloodreavers.
This spell called into being a shroud of blood droplets swirling around the caster. The droplets would coagulate into an iron wall to intercept any physical attacks aimed at the caster. A blood mantle was very conductive to electricity, posing a risk for the caster while active against that form of attack. The caster was able to hurl the mantle up to  away to form a  curtain of blood to serve as a protective wall similar to the wall of iron spell but not susceptible to any rust attacks. Once thrown the blood mantle could not be moved for the spells duration. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a red gemstone worth at least 24 gp to cast.
