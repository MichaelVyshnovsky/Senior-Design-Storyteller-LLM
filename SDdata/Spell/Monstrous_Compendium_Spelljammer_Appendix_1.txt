Yes, Virginia, there really are giant space hamsters lurking in these pages, as well as whole new races ready for the DM to launch into a SPELLJAMMER campaign. Once again, there are 64 pages of new beasties for your playing enjoyment, 5-hole punched and ready for insertion in your Monstrous Compendium binder. Plus, the great (4) full-color divider pages with identification tabs make it easier to organize your critters.''}}
