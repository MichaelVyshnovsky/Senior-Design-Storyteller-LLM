        "mainbody": "'''''Bloodstone's frightful joining''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s. This spell was developed by [[Bloodstone (person)|Bloodstone]].",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the [[necromancer]] to transfer their spirit into an [[undead]] body with total domination. Intelligent forms of undead had a chance to resist the spell, driving the caster's spirit back to their body, often painfully so for the caster. If the joining was successful the caster could use any of the powers of the undead host, excluding any spells memorized by the undead.\n\nThe caster's body remained comatose, and extremely vulnerable while joined with an undead body. The wizard's spirit could travel anywhere in the undead body so long as they remained on the same plane of existence as their own body. Joining with intelligent undead left the wizard open to experiencing an onslaught of mental threats from the undead host, which could drive them to insanity.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast."
