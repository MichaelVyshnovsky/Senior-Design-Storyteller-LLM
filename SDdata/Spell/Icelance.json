        "mainbody": "Icelance was an alteration spell that created a magical lance from an existing supply of ice which then flew off to strike a chosen target.\nThis spell required a supply of approximately 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) of ice, or the remains of an ice storm spell or similar effect. The ice particles formed a sharp lance in a few seconds and then propelled itself in a straight line toward whatever target the caster designated. The lance attempted to hit its target with considerably more skill than the caster had, and if successful, did heavy damage and had a chance to stun the target for a few minutes. Regardless if the attack was successful, unsuccessful, or intercepted by a non-intended target, the lance dissolved back into ice particles once the attack was attempted.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components as well as a supply of ice nearby.\nIcelance was one of four unique spells contained in the Tome of Rathdaen. By the 1360s DR, icelance was an uncommon spell in the Realms."
