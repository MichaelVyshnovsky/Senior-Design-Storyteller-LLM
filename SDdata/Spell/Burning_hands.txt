'''''Burning hands''''' was a [[spell]] of the [[alteration]] school of [[arcane magic|magic]].

==Effects==
Learned by some [[wizard]]s of relatively low experience, ''burning hands'' momentarily engulfed the wizard's hands in a burst of magical flames and then expelled them rapidly into an adjacent area of roughly {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. Earlier versions projected a cone of flame from the fingertips of the caster's outstretched hands, thumbs touching. These flames did no harm to the wizard but could scorch the flesh of others caught nearby during the fiery blast. The effect was instantaneous but damaging and the wizard required only a short, momentary rest to refocus in order to cast the spell again.

The post [[Second Sundering]] version cast flames in a {{SIAdj|15|ft}} cone and had the older spell casting method of having ones thumbs together with outstretched hands. This ignited any flammable object that wasn't worn or carried.

If cast in the [[phlogiston]], the spell caused the immediate detonation of the caster and everything within a 5 ft (1.5 m) range.

===Variant===
A modified version of ''burning hands'' was developed by the [[mage]] [[Asmiak]] before the [[Time of Troubles]]. It created a thinner, but longer ray of fire that extended {{SIrange|2|8|ft|long=yes}} out from the caster. The flame was directional and could be fanned back and forth. 

==Components==
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.

===Inscription===
According to the [[Book of the Silver Talon]], the ingredients for the [[ink]] used to inscribe ''burning hands'' into [[spellbook]]s was: one ounce of [[giant octopus]] ink, two ounces of green plant matter, four ounces of animal flesh, a piece of wood (such as a log or plank), a scrap of cloth, a sheet of parchment and either 3 drops of [[red dragon|red]]/[[gold dragon]] blood, two ounces of [[fire elemental]] phlogiston, six [[salamander]] scales, or the horn of an [[efreeti]]. The last component of the ink could be replaced with the ichor of a [[hellhound]], blood of a [[fire drake]] or ash of a [[tome guardian]].

All the components, save for the ink, would be added to a burning brazier and burnt down. The coals that fed the fire would be added to the mixture and lastly combined with the octopus ink. The sediment would not be emptied and the concoction was to remain covered until cool.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Primidon]] in {{Yearlink|-1909}} and was originally called ''Primidon's burners''.

Before the [[Spellplague]], ''burning hands'' was also used by [[sorcerer]]s and could only be cast a number of times equal to how many times the wizard had prepared the spell or the sorcerer had energy for. After the Spellplague ''burning hands'' became easier to access, though as a consequence it no longer grew in power with its caster.
