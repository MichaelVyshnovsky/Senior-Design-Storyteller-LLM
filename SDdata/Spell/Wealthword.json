        "mainbody": "Wealthword was a divine magic spell given to specialty priests and other followers of Waukeen, Libertys Maiden. It was a variation on the wealthtwist spell that converted material wealth into a beneficial spell that the recipient could cast at any time in the future by uttering a secret word.\nThis spell operated in the same manner as wealthtwist except the verbal and somatic components were slightly different, and the material cost was greater. Wealthword could transform coins, gems, and/or trade bars into one of the following beneficial spells to be activated at a later date cure blindness or deafness, cure disease, cure light wounds, cure serious wounds, cure critical wounds, dimension door, heal, neutralize poison, or regenerate. The amount of wealth consumed was directly proportional to the level of the beneficial spell being imbued, at a rate of 500 gold pieces per level of the spell.\nThe boon was chosen by the caster and he or she had to touch the payment as part of the casting of wealthword. If the value of the monetary sacrifice was insufficient for the spell effect chosen, the caster was immediately aware of this and either had to choose a lesser spell, or touch more funds within the two minute casting time. Otherwise, the wealthword spell was wasted. Upon receipt of sufficient payment, the caster placed the beneficial spell in the mouth of the person or creature by touching the recipients tongue. At the same time, the caster whispered a secret word that the recipient could use to active the spell at a time of need.\nThis spell could not be removed from the recipient by any known means including dispel magic, and it remained viable until activated. To activate the beneficial effect, the recipient did not have to have any skill with magic&mdashjust the ability to speak the secret word.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell consumed a quantity of coins, gems, and/or trade bars of sufficient value to cast a delayed version of the desired beneficial spell.\nThis spell was typically used on merchants that worshiped Waukeen and donated money to the church."
