'''''Brilliant aura''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell outlined the caster's allies in a luminous vapor. As a result, their melee and ranged weapons temporarily became energy weapons. The energy weapons were strong enough to penetrate most armor but had no effect on [[construct]]s, objects or [[undead]] creatures. The aura illuminated the surrounding area up to {{SI|20|ft}} around each ally.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
