        "mainbody": "Smite was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThis powerful spell was used by a shugenja to bring forth the wrath of their deity. During casting, the shugenja pointed their holy symbol at the target creature. The creature was then wracked with terrible pain throughout its body. Additionally, the creature was inflicted with blindness and disease, the effects identical to the cause blindness and cause disease spells.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, the shugenjas holy symbol."
