Spiderbind was a spell used by clerics of Eilistraee.
Similar to the slow spell, this spell made a targeted creature slower in their actions and reflexes. As the spell was developed to primarily target spiderkind, it also protected against poisonous attacks.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component.
This spell was created by the Church of Eilistraee to defend its clerics against the spiderkind creatures who served Lolth.
