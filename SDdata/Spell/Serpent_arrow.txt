Serpent arrow was an arcane, transmutation spell that transformed normal mundane projectiles, such as darts, arrows or crossbow bolts, into flying vipers once they achieved flight.
Upon casting this spell, the caster imbued up to eight missiles with the potential to morph into small, venomous snakes, for a duration of at least an hour. 
The projectiles were completely mundane until fired, after which they morphed into a small viper, and remain in that form until the end of the spells duration. These serpentine creatures would continuously bite whomever would have been struck by the projectile, or if it missed, whomever was closest to them upon landing. The snakes could be directed by the caster to attack a target of their choice, injecting them with venom upon every successful bite.
The material component for this spell was a scale from any species of snake.
The serpent arrow spell was available to clerics, but only to a specific kind. It was only available to clerics of Varae who had been initiated on a path to the faiths greatest secrets.
