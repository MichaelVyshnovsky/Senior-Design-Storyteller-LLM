        "mainbody": "'''''Mark of brotherhood''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[cleric]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, a glyph appeared on each hand of the caster. One glyph was the symbol of the caster's clan, and the other the caster's [[holy symbol]]. The glyphs became invisible and were only visible to those dwarves who had the same glyphs. The glyphs were permanent, but they vanished if the caster committed a serious offense against their clan and/or clergy. If such a thing came to pass, the glyphs flared with a brilliant light and seared the caster's hands, causing them great pain and leaving behind scars. The scars were permanent; no amount of healing could remove them. The only way to remove the scars was if the caster made amends for their offenses.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a [[coin]] made from [[steel]] that had the caster's clan symbol on one side and their holy symbol on the other. The coin was consumed by the spell."
