        "mainbody": "Ladder was an arcane magic spell of the southern magic tradition that created a ladder of force.\nThe ladder created was 1 ft (30 cm) wide and a minimum of 20 ft (6.1 m) long. More experienced casters could extend the length up to 60 ft (18 m). The ladder was firmly set when cast and could not be moved. The ladder of force lasted for 10 minutes or until dispelled, whichever came first.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a knot of any kind of wood as a material component."
