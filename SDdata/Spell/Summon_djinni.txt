Summon djinni was a spell used by wizards.
When cast, this spell summoned a djinni, a powerful genie from the Elemental Plane of Air. The caster had control over the djinni, and it would defend the caster or attack her or his enemies. If the caster mistreated the djinni, it could break the control over it and turn against the caster.
