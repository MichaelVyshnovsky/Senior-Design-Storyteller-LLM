Beast sense was a divination spell that allowed a caster to use the senses of a willing creature.
The caster gained any special senses possessed by the target creature. The caster was able to see and hear but was not able to do so from their own body. The spell lasted for an hour unless prompted to end early or if there was a loss of concentration.
Casting this spell required only somatic components.
