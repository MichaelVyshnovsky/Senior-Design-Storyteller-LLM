Forceward was a spell used by clerics and paladins of Helm.
When cast, this spell created an invisible barrier of force. The barrier was a sphere centered on the caster. It had a radius of . Despite being transparent, the spherical barrier gave off a bright light, strong enough to illuminate the inside of the sphere and the area immediately surrounding it. The barrier allowed the casters allies to enter but prevented all others from entering. The barrier did not block spells or objects from entering the interior.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a divine focus.
