        "Effects": "This spell created a ring of lightning that surrounded the caster at chest-height. The ''lightning ring'' would move with the caster and the caster could work other magic while the ring was active. The ring prevented all forms of lightning from harming the caster.\n\n''[[Lightning bolt]]s'' shot from the ring twice per minute, harming any living targets they contacted. The caster could also decide to use all of the ''lightning ring's'' energy at once, releasing eight ''lightning bolts'' to selected targets which ended the spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a glass [[ring]] of any size and some animal fur to cast."
