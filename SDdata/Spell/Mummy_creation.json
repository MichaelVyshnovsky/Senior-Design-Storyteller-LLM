        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to animate one or more corpses for 90 minutes. More experienced casters could animate more bodies and for a longer time. When animated, each corpse had all the abilities of a [[mummy]]. When the spell expired, or the mummy was destroyed, the corpse turned to dust.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, casting this spell required [[mummy dust]] and specially prepared corpses. Preparation of each corpse was a six-hour procedure where the corpse was wrapped and infused with [[embalming fluid]] that cost 1,400 [[gp]]."
