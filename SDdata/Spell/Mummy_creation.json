        "mainbody": "Mummy creation, also known simply as mummy, was a necromantic arcane magic spell of the southern magic tradition similar to animate dead.\nThis spell allowed the caster to animate one or more corpses for 90 minutes. More experienced casters could animate more bodies and for a longer time. When animated, each corpse had all the abilities of a mummy. When the spell expired, or the mummy was destroyed, the corpse turned to dust.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, casting this spell required mummy dust and specially prepared corpses. Preparation of each corpse was a six-hour procedure where the corpse was wrapped and infused with embalming fluid that cost 1,400 gp."
