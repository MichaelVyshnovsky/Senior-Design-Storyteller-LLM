        "Effects": "When cast, the ''elemental legion'' spell conjured forth four powerful [[elemental]]s in the area within the caster's eyesight. The four elementals were representatives of all four elemental planes. They were always furious powers of destruction, hostile to everyone, even their summoner, unless the caster was protected by the ''[[protection from evil]]'' spell. After being summoned, the four elementals were dismissed in two and a half minutes, or longer, if cast by a druid or a Silverstar or a truly epic power."
