}}'''''Water blast''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This spell turned a regular bottle, or vial, of water into a deadly weapon. The caster opened the bottle and aimed the opening at a target, striking one target at a time as a ''[[magic missile]]'' would.

The water would always strike the target's face unless otherwise prevented from doing so. In addition to causing physical damage, the water blast blinded a target unless they did not have eyes.

A bottle of holy water used this way caused additional damage to the [[undead]].

==Components==
This spell required a bottle of water to cast.
