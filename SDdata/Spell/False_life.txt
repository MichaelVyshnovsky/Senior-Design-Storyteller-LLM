False life was a necromancy spell that granted the caster a temporary boost of health above his or her normal healthy state.
This spell only affected the caster and lasted a number of hours per the power of the caster, or until the extra health was lost (due to injury or disease, for example), whichever came first.
After the Second Sundering, the spell would grant a higher temporary health boost depending what level the spell was cast at. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the caster had to draw mystical sigils on his or her body with a small quantity of alcohol or distilled spirits. The sigils faded from view when the alcohol evaporated.
