'''''False life''''' was a [[necromancy]] spell that granted the caster a temporary boost of health above his or her normal healthy state.

==Effects==
This spell only affected the caster and lasted a number of hours per the power of the caster, or until the extra health was lost (due to injury or disease, for example), whichever came first.

After the [[Second Sundering]], the spell would grant a higher temporary health boost depending what level the spell was cast at. 

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the caster had to draw mystical sigils on his or her body with a small quantity of alcohol or distilled spirits. The sigils faded from view when the alcohol evaporated.
