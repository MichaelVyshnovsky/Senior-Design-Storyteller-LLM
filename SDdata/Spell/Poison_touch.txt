'''''Poison touch''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Talona]], enabling them to inflict corrosive harm with a touch.

==Effects==
This spell created a brown radiance around the caster's hand. The caster needed to touch a target within five seconds or the spell would be wasted. The caster could touch a target anywhere on their body regardless of what they were wearing.

The corrosion would burn a hole through metal armor and cause ghastly welts to appear on the target's skin. Furthermore, the poison caused the victim to become sluggish with all of their body movements and sometimes caused the victim to pass into unconsciousness.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components to cast.
