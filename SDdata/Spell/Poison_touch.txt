Poison touch was a divine alteration and necromancy spell used by priests devoted to Talona, enabling them to inflict corrosive harm with a touch.
This spell created a brown radiance around the casters hand. The caster needed to touch a target within five seconds or the spell would be wasted. The caster could touch a target anywhere on their body regardless of what they were wearing.
The corrosion would burn a hole through metal armor and cause ghastly welts to appear on the targets skin. Furthermore, the poison caused the victim to become sluggish with all of their body movements and sometimes caused the victim to pass into unconsciousness.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
