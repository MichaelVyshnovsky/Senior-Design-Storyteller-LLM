Power word, stun was a conjuration spell that stunned strong creatures. and the elven goddess Sehanine Moonbow.
As the power word was spoken, a single being chosen by caster was stunned they didnt even need to hear the word. How long the creature was stunned depended on the power of the creature, but typically stunning would last between five seconds and a minute and a half. Very powerful creatures were not affected at all. A stunned creature could not act.
The spell required only a verbal component.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Xanad in  and was originally called Xanads stun.
