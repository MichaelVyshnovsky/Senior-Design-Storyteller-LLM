Flame dagger was an evocation spell that created a dagger-like blade of pure flame to appear in the hand of the caster.
Similar to the druidic spell flame blade, the magical blade of fire could be wielded by the caster for a short time. It was particularly harmful to the undead and other creatures vulnerable to fire.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, either a candle or a pinch of sulfur and iron mixed together.
This spell was used exclusively by the Red Wizards of Thay and their allies.
