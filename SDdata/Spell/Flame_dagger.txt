'''''Flame dagger''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a [[dagger]]-like blade of pure flame to appear in the hand of the caster.

==Effects==
Similar to the [[druid]]ic spell ''[[flame blade]]'', the magical blade of fire could be wielded by the caster for a short time. It was particularly harmful to the [[undead]] and other creatures vulnerable to fire.

==Casting==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s, either a candle or a pinch of [[sulfur]] and [[iron]] mixed together.

==History==
This spell was used exclusively by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] and their allies.
