        "mainbody": "'''''Shadow blade''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that created a [[sword]] made of solidified shadow.",
        "Effects": "The spell condensed the shadows to create a lightweight sword that inflicted damage upon the minds of the creatures it hit. The sword lasted for up to 1 minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating. It was especially accurate in poorly lit environments and became deadlier the more powerful the caster became. If thrown toward an opponent, the blade magically reappeared in the caster's hand at a command.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
