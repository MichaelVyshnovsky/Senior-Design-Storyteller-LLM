Aerial servant was a common spell used by clerics. The spell allowed the caster to summon an aerial servant.
The summoned aerial servant was tasked with finding and returning with either a creature or an object. Unlike other summoning spells, the aerial servant would not engage in combat for the caster. The spell itself also did not allow the caster to control the aerial servant. Preparation beforehand was required for the caster to maintain some control over the aerial servant, which included casting a protection from evil spell on themselves or by using a special item that allowed the caster to control a summoned creature. If these steps were not taken by the caster beforehand, summoning an aerial servant resulted in it attacking the caster.
The creature or object that the aerial servant was tasked to find and retrieve had to be carried by the creature and no heavier than . If retrieving an unwilling creature, the aerial servant had to attack and overpower it before transporting it. If it failed in this task, it returned to its home plane. The aerial servant had until the spell expired, which was a single day, to successfully complete its task. 
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
