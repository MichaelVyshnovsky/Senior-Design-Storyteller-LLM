        "Politics": "The nominal head of government was a hereditary Emperor, who traditionally took over from his father at a very young age, necessitating the services of a regent to rule in his name. The old Emperor was forced into retirement, but still maintained some influence with a title of Retired Emperor. This meant that generally there were three factions in the Imperial Court vying for control.\n\nOver several hundred years, the position of Emperor faded in importance and the shogun became the ''de facto'' ruler of Kozakura. The position of Shogun was, however, tainted with much of the same politics and maneuvering that affected the Emperor.  This resulted in many shoguns ascending to the position at a young age themselves, and the need for a shikken, which was a regent for the Shogun.",
        "Society": "Kozakuran society had a caste system. At the highest level were the samurai caste.<ref group=\"note\">This should not be confused with the [[samurai]] class for player-character class. The samurai caste were the nobles of Kozakura and responsible for the administration of the provinces and the nation. They were organized by their families.\n\nBeneath the samurai caste were the clergy, who served as priests in the various temples. The clergy welcomed people from all walks of life, including retired samurai, sons of peasants, widows, and so on.\n\nThe majority of the population was made up of the peasants, who were divided into several groups. The farmers tended to be the backbone of the land, and were also organized into families in the same way as the samurai caste, with the head of a family responsible for collecting rent and taxes. Craftsmen had variable status depending on their craft, their skill, and their renown. Merchants, including moneylenders were found at this level, though they might have some control over the other members of the peasant class economically. The lowest of the peasant class were the entertainers, including actors, singers, and musicians.\n\nBelow even the peasants were the outcasts, called ''eta'', who performed duties that were considered distasteful, unclean, or forbidden. Outcasts were quite literally cast out from the rest of society. All the other castes treated them with contempt, and contact was generally avoided. They were considered non-people, and marriages with them forbidden. The trades that were filled by outcasts included executioners, butchers, tanners, and morticians.",
        "Religion": "There were two major religions in Kozakura: the [[Eight Million Gods]] and the [[Way of Enlightenment]]. The former was a collection of ancient practices native to Kozakura devoted to a variety of nature spirits, and the latter was a religious practice brought from Shou Lung and devoted to guiding its practitioners to spiritual perfection.\n\nIt was normal for a Kozakuran to recognize and participate in more than one religion, shrine, or school of thought. Those who dedicated themselves to the pursuits of only one religion tended to be priests, monks, [[shukenja]], and [[sohei]].\n\nThe [[korobokuru]] of Kozakura worshiped a pantheon of animal spirits. Sometimes, their heroes were elevated mythically to the state of half-animalistic demigods.",

            "Post-Spellplague": "The [[Spellplague]] of {{YearlinkConvert|1459|KY}} was as catastrophic in Kozakura and Shou Lung as it was in Faerûn. It caused many to migrate west, into the Hordelands and even Faerûn.<ref>\n\nFollowing the Spellplague, Kozakura became embroiled in a civil war.{{cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|4}} This conflict was encouraged by the [[Iridescent Peacock Society]], a mercenary cabal of [[wu jen]] that profited by selling their services to those who paid the most.<ref>{{cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|6}} It led to opposing factions, out-of-control brigandry, and ronin armies. Most [[hengeyokai]] and [[spirit folk]] stayed out of the fighting, either going further into the wilds or escaping to [[Shou Lung]], where [[Sheng Ti]] province, via the port of [[Lo'Shan]], was seen as a sanctuary.<ref>{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|2}} Nevertheless, a dedicated few worked to protect the common people from marauders and bandits. Notably, the [[monkey hengeyokai]] martial artist [[Aoi]] fought alone to defend seven villages from a 100-strong ronin army, making her a hero in southwestern Shinkoku. The civil war had faded by {{YearlinkConvert|1553|KY}}."
