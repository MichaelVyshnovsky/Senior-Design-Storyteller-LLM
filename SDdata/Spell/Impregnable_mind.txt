Impregnable mind was an enchantment spell that greatly improved the recipients chances of resisting magical or psionic attacks on the mind.
For ten minutes, more depending on the level of the caster, the recipient of this spell was much less likely to be beguiled, charmed, dominated, feebleminded, held or succumb to similar mind-affecting spells and psionics. Even when the odds were hopeless, this spell gave a chance to resist supposedly non-resistible assaults on the mind. Note that magical and psionic attacks that attack the body (such as telekinesis) were not prevented by this spell.
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.
