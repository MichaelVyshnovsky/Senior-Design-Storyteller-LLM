Skulk was a divine illusion spell used by priests devoted to Ibrandul, enabling them to move like a chameleon.
This spell allowed the caster to move quickly, quietly, and to blend with their surroundings when motionless. Even skilled trackers had a hard time following anyone under the influence of a skulk spell.
There was a small cumulative chance that the caster would be permanently transformed into a skulk with each use of this spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol, a small piece of skin from a chameleon, and a dead spider to cast.
