Breathe was an alteration spell of the southern magic tradition. 
When cast, the spell allowed the caster or the target creature to breathe normally in a location or substance it would normally suffocate. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component. A cloth of any material was held over the casters mouth while reciting the verbal component of the spell.
