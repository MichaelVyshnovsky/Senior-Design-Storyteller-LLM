Past life was a divination spell used by wizards.
Upon touching a dead creature, this spell allowed the caster to see a mental image of how the deceased appeared in life. The was no limit on the age of the remains for this spell to work, provided a small body fragment, such as a piece of hair or bone splinter, was used during the casting. A personal possession, such as a ring, of the deceased could be used instead of remains if the caster was skilled enough.
Casters with a certain degree of skill could also view the final minutes of the deceaseds life through their eyes right before their death.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
