'''''Tenser's transformation''''' ({{Pronounce|TEN|sur|refs={{Cite dragon/93/Ay pronunseeAYshun gyd|30}}}}) was a spell that made the caster a virtual fighting machine&mdash;improving the caster's strength, dexterity, and physical constitution, as well as increasing the natural thickness of his or her skin. While granting those physical advantages, it prevented spellcasting and the ability to use any magical devices.

To [[Zakhara]]n mages, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''transformation''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]] and [[material component]]s. The material required was some hair from a [[bull]].
