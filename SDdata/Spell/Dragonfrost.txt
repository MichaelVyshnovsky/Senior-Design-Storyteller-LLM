Dragonfrost is a spell similar to ray of frost used by sorcerers, particularly dragon sorcerers. When it is cast, dragonfrost slams an icy gust into a creature of the sorcerers choice within fifty feet, pushing them back up to five feet and causing them injury from its frigid power, which is fueled by the sorcerers charisma like virtually all sorcerer spells. Dragonfrost is instantly recastable and its power grows as the sorcerer using it does.
