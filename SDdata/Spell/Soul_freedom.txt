'''''Soul freedom''''' was an [[Elven High Magic]] [[wizard]] [[spell]].

==Effects==
This spell changed the inherent nature of evil beings into individuals pure of heart. The subject of this spell had a slim chance of resisting the spell's effects. The evil within these individuals attempted to resurface on a monthly basis for the first year after the spell was cast, and then on an annual basis for the next decade. If the evil was unable to fully resurface after ten years then the change became permanent.

==Components==
This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.
