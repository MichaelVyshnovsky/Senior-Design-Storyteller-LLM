'''''Passwall''''' was a [[transmutation]] spell that breached walls. The maximum thickness of the wall depended on the magical power of the caster.

==Effect==
The caster could create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. If the wall's thickness was too great, then a single casting of ''passwall'' simply made a niche or short tunnel. Several ''passwall'' spells could be cast in succession to form a continuing passage to breach very thick walls. When a ''passwall'' spell ended, creatures within the passage were ejected out the nearest exit. If someone dispelled the ''passwall'' effect, or if the caster dismissed it, creatures in the passage were ejected out the far exit if there was one, or out the sole exit otherwise.

==Variants==
The [[drow]] variant of the ''passwall'' spell could create passageways through solid stone and dirt, but it had a very short duration.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]] and material components. The material required was a pinch of [[sesame|sesame seeds]].

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Aksa]] the Destroyer in {{Yearlink|-2058}} and was originally called '''''Aksa's passage'''''.

==Notable Uses==
During the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], [[Kyriani]] asked [[Khelben Arunsun]] to cast a ''passwall'' so she could escape [[Castle Waterdeep]].{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|20}}

==Trivia==
Most of the creatures native to the [[elemental planes]] of [[Elemental Plane of Earth|Earth]], [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Dust|Dust]], [[Fountains of Creation|Magma]], [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals|Minerals]], and [[Swamp of Oblivion|Ooze]] had an innate ability similar to ''passwall''. It was limited to stone materials, but they could extend it to any creature they were touching.<ref>
