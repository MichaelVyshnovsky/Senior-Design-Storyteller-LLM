        "mainbody": "'''''Force orb''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a number of spheres of pure energy that were shot out from the caster, directed towards several targets of their choosing.",
        "Effects": "Originally, the ''force orbs'' created by this spell approximately 3\" (7.6 cm) in diameter and instantly streaked forth from the palm of the caster. They could travel well over 100' (30.5 m) and burst in 10' blasts, regardless of whether or not they struck their intended target. \n\nFollowing the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], the spheres were completely imperceptible, were hurled by the caster up to 100' away, and burst into many tiny invisible daggers upon impact.",
        "Casting": "The spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to be cast. While it was fairly easy to learn, it required considerable concentration on the part of the [[spellcaster]] to cast.",
        "Usage": "This spell was common among the [[Nentyar hunter|hunters]] that served the [[druid]]ic [[Nentyarch]] of the [[Circle of Leth]]."
