        "mainbody": "Rosetouch was a spell that was commonly used by clerics of Lathander.\nThis spell allowed a caster to repair any single item. When cast, the casters hand emitted a brilliant rose light. The caster then touched a specific item to repair. The spell could also be used to mend injuries but it could not restore life-force. As the item was being mended, the rose light pulsed until the item was repaired. This spell could not be used to restore magical properties to a magical item or weapon.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
