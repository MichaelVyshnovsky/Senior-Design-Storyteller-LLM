        "mainbody": "Unquestioning obedience was a divine enchantment spell used by specialty priests devoted to Siamorphe called Highborns, enabling them to command others with a phrase.\nThis spell allowed the priest to command complete obedience by uttering a simple phrase as long as the target understood the priests language. The target would obey concise commands as best as they could. Any command that would cause immediate harm to or kill the target would cause the spell to end.\nA single command could be given to the target per casting of this spell.\nThis spell required only verbal components to cast."
