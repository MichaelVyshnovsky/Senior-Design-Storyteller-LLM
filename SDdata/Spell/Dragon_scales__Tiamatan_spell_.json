        "mainbody": "Dragon scales was a divine alteration spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Tiamat called Wyrmkeepers.\nThis spell protected the wyrmkeeper by causing dragon scale plating to grow from their skin, covering their entire body except their head. The wyrmkeeper was able to choose the color of the scales from any chromatic dragon species, but the protection they offered was not determined by the color. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a single dragon scale to cast."
