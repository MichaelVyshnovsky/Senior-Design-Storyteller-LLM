        "mainbody": "Blackstaff was a spell applied to a staff or quarterstaff that enhanced its combat effectiveness, and gave it the ability to dispel magic or cause a spellcaster it struck to lose a prepared spell.\nWhen cast, this spell bestowed upon the target non-magical staff, polearm or club, a +4 enchantment.\nWhen the blackstaff struck a magical item or any person, it dispelled magic and in the case of spellcasters, caused them to forget spells they had memorized.\nThe effects of blackstaff could not be dispelled and the staff absorbed any spells cast directly at it.\nNone of the effects of the blackstaff could harm the caster in any way.\nThis spell was created by Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun and was part of the reason why his common appellation was Blackstaff, as he carried a staff of power that had this spell cast on it with permanency. \nThe blackstaff spell was found in Laerals Libram, a spellbook written by the wizard Laeral Silverhand. Laeral lost the spellbook sometime during her madness induced by the Crown of Horns, and it was not been seen since. Khelben only shared this spell with those he trusted implicitly. \nHowever, by the , the spell blackstaff was known and in use across the Realms."
