        "mainbody": "'''''Blackstaff''''' was a spell applied to a [[staff]] or [[quarterstaff]] that enhanced its combat effectiveness, and gave it the ability to ''[[dispel magic]]'' or cause a spellcaster it struck to lose a prepared spell.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell bestowed upon the target non-magical staff, [[polearm]] or club, a ''+4 [[Item enchantment|enchantment]]''.\n\nWhen the ''blackstaff'' struck a [[magic]]al item or any person, it ''dispelled magic'' and in the case of [[spellcaster]]s, caused them to forget spells they had memorized.\n\nThe effects of ''blackstaff'' could not be dispelled and the staff absorbed any [[spell]]s cast directly at it.\n\nNone of the effects of the ''blackstaff'' could harm the caster in any way.",
        "History": "This spell was created by [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] and was part of the reason why his common appellation was ''Blackstaff'', as he carried a [[staff of power]] that had this spell cast on it with [[permanency]]. \n\nThe ''blackstaff'' spell was found in ''[[Laeral's Libram]]'', a spellbook written by the wizard [[Laeral Silverhand]]. Laeral lost the spellbook sometime during her madness induced by the [[Crown of Horns]], and it was not been seen since. Khelben only shared this spell with those he trusted implicitly. \n\nHowever, by the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the spell ''blackstaff'' was known and in use across the Realms."
