Berronars favor was a spell used by clerics of Berronar Truesilver.
The sole purpose of this spell was to stimulate economic activity in a dawrven enclave that was experiencing significant hardship. When cast, the spell summoned a single lock of hair from Berronar herself. Within a day, the hair turned into gold with a value up to 8,000 gp.
For this spell to be cast successfully, the caster had to be a high-ranking priest and lawful good. In addition, the gold must be used to aid the community. If not used in such a manner, the gold immediately vanished.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, the holy symbol of Berronar.
