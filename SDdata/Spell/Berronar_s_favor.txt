'''''Berronar's favor''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Berronar Truesilver]].

==Effects==
The sole purpose of this spell was to stimulate economic activity in a dawrven enclave that was experiencing significant hardship. When cast, the spell summoned a single lock of hair from Berronar herself. Within a day, the hair turned into [[gold]] with a value up to 8,000 [[gp]].

For this spell to be cast successfully, the caster had to be a high-ranking priest and [[lawful good]]. In addition, the gold must be used to aid the community. If not used in such a manner, the gold immediately vanished.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], the holy symbol of Berronar.
