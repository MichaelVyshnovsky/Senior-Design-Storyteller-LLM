        "mainbody": "Adaptation was an extremely rare divine healing spell granted to clerics by their deities.\nThe spell was cast upon a creature with a touch. It allowed the target to become unaffected by effects and gases that affected breathing. Adaptation rendered the target unaffected by poisonous or harmful gases, such as the effects of the stinking cloud spell, the recipient could not drown, and could exist in vacuum. The spell lasted for twenty four hours and the caster could divide the total time between multiple targets, with half an hour being the shortest. Effects of the spell were similar to wearing a necklace of adaptation.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components, as well as holy water as the material component.\n*General Clas Denwith, the head of the Church of Tempus in Ormpetarr, Sespech, circa 1370 DR.\n*General Vandemar Cordwin, the leader of the Church of Tempus in the Vilhon Reach circa 1370 DR."
