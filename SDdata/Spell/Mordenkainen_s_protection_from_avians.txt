Mordenkainens protection from avians was an uncommon protection spell.
When cast, the caster was given protection from attacks by most avian creatures. The caster could cast this spell on another individual, but they had to come into physical contact during casting.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a feather with a strip of leather wrapped around it. The feather could come from any bird species.
