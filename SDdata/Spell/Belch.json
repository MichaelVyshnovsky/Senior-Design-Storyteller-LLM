        "mainbody": "Belch was a person-affecting cantrip that beginning wizards could learn. It caused a target creature to involuntarily burp.\nThis cantrip could target a creature within  of the caster and cause it to burp. The target had a chance to resist the spell. If successful, they were able to stifle the reaction so it amounted to a relatively quiet hiccup. Failure meant a loud, very noticeable belch.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster pressed a hand to their own diaphragm while emitting a tiny, quiet burp."
