        "mainbody": "Wisdom was a type of giant rune that improved upon the mental abilities of whoever wielded its inscribed object.\nThose who wore the inscribed helmet or girdle would be granted a mild improvement to both their intellect and wisdom. The duration of this effect was equal to the casters level. Upon removal of the runed object this effect would instantly cease.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune healing. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to twelve hours."
