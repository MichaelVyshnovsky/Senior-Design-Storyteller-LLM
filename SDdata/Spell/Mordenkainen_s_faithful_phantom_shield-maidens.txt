Mordenkainens faithful phantom shield-maidens was an uncommon spell which summoned a pair of spectral guardians.
With this spell, the caster was able to summon a pair of phantom shield-maidens to their side. The shield-maidens protected the caster from all enemies within  of the caster. They remained close to the caster so their two shields could provide cover. They always remained within  of the caster, even if ordered to go farther by the caster.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a small figure of the caster made from wood with a pair of shields made from crystal tied to it.
