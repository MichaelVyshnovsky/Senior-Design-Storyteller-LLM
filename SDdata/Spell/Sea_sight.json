This spell was only usable by wizards.\nWith this spell the target could see through water twice as well as they could on land. Water clarity still affected the distance the target could view. Targets could even stare down into water from a boat without having their vision disturbed by reflections.\nThis spell required the eye of an octopus or squid to cast."
