        "mainbody": "'''''Erupting earth''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that caused an area on the ground to erupt like a fountain.",
        "Effects": "The spell caused a square portion of the ground to erupt in a fountain of [[Earth (element)|earth]] and stone that occupied a cube {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} on a side, hitting all creatures within that volume that could not evade the effect in time. The violence of the spell increased with the caster's power. Although the fountain only lasted for a moment, it covered the area in debris that required a long time to clear.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was a piece of [[obsidian]]."
