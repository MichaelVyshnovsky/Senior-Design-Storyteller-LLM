Dampen was a useful cantrip that wizards-in-training could learn. It filled a small area with light fog that made all surfaces moist to the touch and somewhat obscured vision.
The target of this spell had to be within  of the caster and no larger than . It permeated the area with a thin cloud of mist that left a residue of water on all surfaces. This had the effect of making objects more difficult to light on fire, but it also degraded parchment and other water-susceptible surfaces. Creatures looking into, out of, or through the area of effect could still see normally but found some details were obscured by the fog.
The somatic component of this cantrip was an uplifted hand with wiggling fingers. The verbal component could be either a hummed tune or a low hooting sound.
