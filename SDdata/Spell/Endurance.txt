Endurance was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur.
This spell was used by shugenja to rejuvenate themselves, shedding fatigue caused by lack of sleep or overexertion. It could be cast on other creatures. The spell acted as if the creature had received eight hours of restful sleep. If the creature was already rested, they did not require sleep in the next 24 hours. The spell did not have an effect on recovery of spells.
Fatigue was the reverse of the spell. It had the opposite effect as endurance. It exhausted the target creature, making them feel as if they had not slept at all in the past 24 hours. It therefore affected their movement and thinking process. A full eight hours of sleep was required to negate the spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a pinch of sand. The reverse required a small noisemaker.
