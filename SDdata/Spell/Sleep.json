        "Effects": "''Sleep'', as the name of the spell implies, placed its targets into a light slumber when cast successfully, overcoming the creatures' willpower. It affected a number of creatures that depended on the caster's power.\n\nBetween the [[Spellplague]] and the [[Second Sundering]], it could typically be cast only once per day and affected an area of roughly {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} in a radius within a distance of {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}} from the caster. Creatures that managed to stave off the intended effects of the spell nonetheless found their body fatigued, slowing their movements and thought processes.",
        "Components": "The spell needed [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s to be cast. The materials required were either a pinch of fine [[sand]], [[rose]] petals, or a [[cricket]], any of which could be replaced by the use of an [[arcane focus]].",
        "History": "The spell was credited to the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Efteran]] in {{Yearlink|-1772}} and was originally called ''Efteran's sleep''.",
        "Notable Uses": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], at a party in [[Castle Waterdeep]], [[Kyriani]] got her boyfriend [[Fenn Estelmer]] out of her hair using a ''sleep'' applied secretly via a kiss.{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|7}}"
