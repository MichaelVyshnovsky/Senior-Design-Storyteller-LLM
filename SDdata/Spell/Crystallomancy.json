        "mainbody": "Crystallomancy was a divine magic spell granted to priests of Corellon, Ruler of All Elves. It turned an ordinary gemstone into a scrying device for a short time.\nThis spell imbued a clear or translucent crystal or gem with a power similar to a crystal ball. The caster could scry a distant location for at least one minute, but the more valuable the gemstone, the longer the spell lasted, up to a maximum of one hour. Learned and experienced priests could cast one or more divination spells of the detection type (detect magic, detect evil, and so on) through the device.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the priests holy symbol and a clear or translucent crystalline gem with a minimum value of 1,000 gold pieces as a material component. The gem and holy symbol were not consumed in the casting of the spell."
