The far reaching spells were alteration spells used by wizards.
Far reaching I allowed the caster to amplify the range of any beginner spell. Far reaching II doubled the range for beginner spells and increased the range for intermediate spells by a quarter. Far reaching III performed just like far reaching II but increased the range for intermediate spells by half.
Each casting of the far reaching spells would only affect a single spell cast within one minute. If more than a minute passed and the follow-up spell was not cast then the far reaching spell was wasted. These spells had no effect on "touch" spells.
These spells required only verbal components to cast.
