The '''''far reaching''''' [[spell]]s were [[alteration]] spells used by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
''Far reaching I'' allowed the caster to amplify the range of any beginner spell. ''Far reaching II'' doubled the range for beginner spells and increased the range for intermediate spells by a quarter. ''Far reaching III'' performed just like ''far reaching II'' but increased the range for intermediate spells by half.

Each casting of the ''far reaching'' spells would only affect a single spell cast within one minute. If more than a minute passed and the follow-up spell was not cast then the ''far reaching'' spell was wasted. These spells had no effect on "touch" spells.

==Components==
These spells required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] components to cast.
