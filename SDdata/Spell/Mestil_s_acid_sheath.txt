'''''Mestil's acid sheath''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[cleric]]s with the [[creation domain]]. This spell was created by [[Mestil]].

==Effects==
This spell enclosed the caster in a sheath of fluid [[acid]]. The caster was not harmed by the ''acid sheath'' and could perform all of their normal actions. Any creature striking the caster with a part of their body, such as a claw or bite, was harmed as the acid splashed on them. The caster could also strike out with their hands to inflict corrosive harm.

If cast while riding, the ''acid sheath'' would instantly harm the caster's mount, prompting the mount to try to buck the caster.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a handful of [[fire ant]]s and a [[glass]] sculpture of a [[humanoid]] to cast.

==Notable Users==
*[[Girella Scatterstar]], the head of the [[Mage Guild]] in [[Hillsfar]] in [[1373 DR]].
*[[Vargo Kent]], a [[half-dragon]] senior member of the [[Dragonwell]] cell of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].
*[[Xi'an Vrasl]], a [[drow]] [[arachnomancer]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
