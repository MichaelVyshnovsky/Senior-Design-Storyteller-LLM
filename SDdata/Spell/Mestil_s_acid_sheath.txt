Mestils acid sheath was a conjuration spell used by wizards, sorcerers, and clerics with the creation domain. This spell was created by Mestil.
This spell enclosed the caster in a sheath of fluid acid. The caster was not harmed by the acid sheath and could perform all of their normal actions. Any creature striking the caster with a part of their body, such as a claw or bite, was harmed as the acid splashed on them. The caster could also strike out with their hands to inflict corrosive harm.
If cast while riding, the acid sheath would instantly harm the casters mount, prompting the mount to try to buck the caster.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a handful of fire ants and a glass sculpture of a humanoid to cast.
