        "mainbody": "Silent portal was an illusion spell or glamer used by wizards, sorcerers, and assassins.\nThis spell negated any sound made by opening or closing a single non-magical portal by normal means. Smashing a window would still make noise for example. The portal could be a door, window, gate, chest lid, etc.\nThis spell required only somatic components to cast."
