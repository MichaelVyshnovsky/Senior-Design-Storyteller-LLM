        "mainbody": "Mirror image allowed the caster to bring several illusions of him or herself into being in the casters immediate surroundings. The images behaved and looked exactly like the caster, and the caster was able to merge with, or split from, any of the images at will. If an image were struck, such as with a weapon, it disappeared for good.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Smolyn in  and was originally called Smolyns replica.\nNotably, the Cormyrean state sword Ilbratha allowed its wielder to cast mirror image on him or herself (and the sword) once per day."
