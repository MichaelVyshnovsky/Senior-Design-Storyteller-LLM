'''''Throbbing bones''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]] from the school of [[necromancy]] that caused the target's bones to pulse within their body.

==Powers==
The magic of the spell would affect a single target, provided they had an internal skeleton. Movement and basic tasks were difficult for the target for the spell's duration as they were wracked with pain.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] two pieces of a small bone that was snapped in half to cast.

==History==
This spell was found within the ''[[Book of Shadows]]'', a [[tome]] based upon the oration of the [[necromancer]] [[Nebt Bhakau]] of [[Zakhara]].
