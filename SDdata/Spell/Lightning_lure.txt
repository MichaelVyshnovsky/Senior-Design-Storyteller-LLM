Lightning lure is among the most basic swordmage spells, used most commonly by shielding swordmages. When cast lightning lure lashes a creature of the swordmages choosing within fifteen feet with a whip-like bolt of painful lightning, which the swordmage can use to pull the target towards them. Lightning lure does not work, however, if there is no clear path between the swordmage and his or her target. The spell, which relies, like virtually all swordmage spells, upon its casters intellect for power, increases in deadliness as the swordmage gains more experience. As a very basic and easy to learn spell, lightning lure can be cast at will.
