If more than a minute passed before the second spell was cast then the dilation spell was wasted.\nDilation I increased the area of effect of basic spells by a quarter. Dilation II increased the area of effect of basic spells by half and intermediate spells by a quarter.\nThese spells only required verbal components to cast."
