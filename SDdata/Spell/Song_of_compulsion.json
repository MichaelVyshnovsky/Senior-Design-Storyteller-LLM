        "mainbody": "Song of compulsion was a divine enchantment spell used by priests devoted to Milil, enabling them to prevent the actions of others.\nThe caster began singing a popular traveling song with many verses. Anyone within a  cube centered where the caster selected who heard the song would be prevented from performing any actions or leaving the area until the song finished. Affected targets would defend themselves if attacked, but would not initiate combat or go on the offensive.\nThis spell required only verbal components to cast."
