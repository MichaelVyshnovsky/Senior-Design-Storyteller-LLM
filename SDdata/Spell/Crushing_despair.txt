Crushing despair was a spell that made the target sad.
Creatures within a cone 30 feet (9 meters) long from the caster were saddened. They became generally bad at fighting or doing anything as well as resisting other effects.
Crushing despair could counter good hope as well as dispel it.
The spell required somatic, verbal, and material components, which was a vial of tears.
