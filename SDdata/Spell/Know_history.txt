Know history was a common spell used by shugenja and wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, the spell disclosed the basic history of a creature, item or location to the caster. Information revealed included deeds, name, history or lineage. The spell did not disclose magical abilities or alignment. The spell was used to reveal if a creature was disguised or polymorphed, but would not do so for an item or location. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a pair of bones, carved into any shape.
