'''''Know history''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] and [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell disclosed the basic history of a creature, item or location to the caster. Information revealed included deeds, name, history or lineage. The spell did not disclose magical abilities or alignment. The spell was used to reveal if a creature was disguised or polymorphed, but would not do so for an item or location. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a pair of bones, carved into any shape.
