        "mainbody": "Maximilians stony grasp was an alteration spell used by wizards. This spell was developed by Maximilian.It is possible that Maximilian himself is a Realms character. It is known from Heroes of the Elemental Chaos that Maximilian was a sorcerer who disappeared into the Underdark. It is stated in an earlier Realms source, Menzoberranzan, that certain spells were \"developed in the Underdark\" and then showed up \"in surface lands, even in other worlds\". One spell given in this list is Maximilians stony grasp. This could imply that Maximilian ventured to the Underdark of Toril and invented this spell. However, it is possible that this spell is simply a variant of Maximilians earthen grasp, and the stony version was inspired by Maximilian, not developed by him. Other examples of inspired spells are present in the lore, such as Bigbys snapping digits and varieties of Snillocs spells. Furthermore, it has been clarified by Wizards of the Coast, such as co-lead designer of 5 edition, Mike Mearls, that nobody knows who Maximilian was.[https//twitter.com/mikemearls/status/956425952589856768]\nThis spell caused a man-sized arm of stone to rise from the ground beneath a targeted creature. The arm immediately tried to grab the leg of the target. If successful, the arm would severely impede the targets movement and make it much harder for them to defend themselves.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a miniature hand carved from stone to cast. The carving would crumble to dust when either the hand was destroyed or the spell expired. Additionally, this spell needed to be cast upon stone ground, be it natural or artificial, to function.\nThis spell was developed by Maximilian while in the Underdark, but later on it found usage by some on the surface."
