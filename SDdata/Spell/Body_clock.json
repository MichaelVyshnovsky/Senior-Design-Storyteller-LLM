        "mainbody": "Body clock was a divine alteration spell from the time sphere that had multiple effects upon the target.\nThe target of this spell felt a reduced need for sleep, to breathe, and they could set an internal alarm clock to wake them at a specific time of their choosing.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a kernel of corn, a drop of water, and a stoppered glass bottle to cast.\nThe Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the Mystran faith, could cast the body clock spell."
