'''''Divine Inspiration''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] that [[priest]]s could use to gain knowledge of events happening in the near future.

==Effects==
A more powerful version of ''[[genius]]'', this spell granted the caster knowledge regarding the near future. It had strict limitations, for example it could predict how sentries would react to a disturbance but it couldn't predict the issue of a battle. As for other similar spells, the granted knowledge was always relevant and correct, although it could be incomplete or cryptic.

This spell had a cool-down period of one day before it could be cast again.

==Components==
A [[gem]] with a value of at least 500 [[gp]] was required to cast this spell, in addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.

==History==
Divine Inspiration was one of the spells [[priest]]s could learn by reading [[Wythyndle's Round Book]].
