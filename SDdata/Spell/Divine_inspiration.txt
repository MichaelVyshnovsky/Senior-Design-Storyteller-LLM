Divine Inspiration was a divination spell that priests could use to gain knowledge of events happening in the near future.
A more powerful version of genius, this spell granted the caster knowledge regarding the near future. It had strict limitations, for example it could predict how sentries would react to a disturbance but it couldnt predict the issue of a battle. As for other similar spells, the granted knowledge was always relevant and correct, although it could be incomplete or cryptic.
This spell had a cool-down period of one day before it could be cast again.
A gem with a value of at least 500 gp was required to cast this spell, in addition to verbal and somatic components.
Divine Inspiration was one of the spells priests could learn by reading Wythyndles Round Book.
