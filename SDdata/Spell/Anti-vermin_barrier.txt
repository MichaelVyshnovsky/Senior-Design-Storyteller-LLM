Anti-vermin barrier was a divine abjuration spell from the wards sphere that created a barrier that repelled all nonmagical vermin.
This spell created an invisible barrier that repelled nonmagical vermin including spiders, insects, rats, snakes, worms, etc. The anti-vermin barrier did nothing to stop larger versions of these creatures. The barrier was a cube measuring  on each side.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the casters holy symbol and a rodent whisker to cast.
The Helm of Helm, a holy text from the Church of Helm, contained the anti-vermin barrier spell. It was also recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki.
