Pacification was a spell used to calm a creature. 
When cast, the caster breathed out a calming, gentle wind. A single creature within  of the caster was then calmed, as if the subject of a calm emotions spell. The spell did not function on creatures more powerful than the caster.
This spell required verbal and somatic components. If, during casting, the caster tossed blue spinel dust into the calming breeze, the spell last two minutes longer, with an additional two minutes per skill level.
