        "mainbody": "Wildwind was a wild magic conjuration spell used by wild mages.\nThis spell created a wall of multicolored lights measuring  long in a location of the casters choosing. The caster could move the wall or even rotate it if they wished, but once set into motion the wall could not be stopped unless the spell ended. The wall harmed any creature it touched, but contacting a wizard attempting to cast a spell would instantly trigger a wild surge. Discharging a magic item would also trigger a wild surge.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
