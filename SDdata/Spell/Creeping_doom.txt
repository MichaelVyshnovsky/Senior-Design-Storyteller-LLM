'''''Creeping doom''''' was a [[conjuration]] spell that called into being a carpet of insects that attacked selected targets.

==Effects==
Early versions of this spell summoned 500 to 1,000 poisonous [[spider]]s, scorpions, [[beetle]]s, and [[centipede]]s that swarmed over a {{SI|20|ft}} square area. The later version of this spell summoned up to ten swarms of centipedes, each of which could be commanded independently. A swarm could attack any creature that could be damaged by normal weapons and quickly kill them by sheer numbers even though each bug did minimum damage. Swarms could be directed to move, killing anything in their path. If a swarm got too far away from the caster, the early version started to lose bugs, whereas the later version just stopped moving and attacked any creatures in its area.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
