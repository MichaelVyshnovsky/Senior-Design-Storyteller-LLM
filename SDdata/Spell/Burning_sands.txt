}}'''''Burning sands''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This spell caused regular [[sand]] to become combustible. The sand appeared exactly the same as normal sand, but also had the flammable properties of [[lantern]] [[oil]]. Once lit the sand would burn for the spell's duration or for one hour.

This spell was used heavily by nomadic tribes who did not have access to wood or other material for their fires. One handful of burning sand provided the same heat as a cooking fire. Burning sand could not be extinguished by any normal means.

==Components==
This spell required sand to cast.
