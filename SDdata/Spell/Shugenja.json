        "mainbody": "Shugenja () (also spelled shukenja) were wielders of divine magic who controlled elemental forces. In Shou Lung, shugenja were called dang-ki ().\nUnlike sohei, shugenja were not bound to their monastery or temple, instead wandering the land. A new shugenja received training in a monastery. This training focused on meditation, ritual and self-defense. In Kara-Tur, shugenja performed a variety of services, including marriages, defeating evil spirits, funeral rites and purification rituals.\nShugenja lived by strict principles laid down by their religions. They took vows of poverty and had no connections to their family or clan or the caste systems found across Kara-Tur. They avoided violence and lived a life of discipline. \nShugenja were skilled spell-casters. They had limited training in martial arts or use of weapons, using their divine magic abilities to defend themselves or others. A shugenja can use their ki to protect themselves from physical and mental attacks.  \n* Ce-ishi was a healer at the Shining Temple of Bishamon in the town of Aru in Wa, taking care of the infirmary of the temple.\n* Deng Tse Chin was a shungenja adventurer in Shou Lung.\n* Funada Hashiba was an abbot of the Shining Mountain Sect temple in Nakamaru around 1357 DR.\n* Godokyo took care of the Konjo Subscriber Temple in Kozakura.\n* Motsegai was the abbot at the Kanchai school monastery of Mount Ichi in Kozakura, where the former emperor Gobidamu retired to.\n* Pien-Hung was a traveling shungenja in Kozakura in 1357 DR.\n* Pitalla used a wish from the leaping fish to cure the settlement of Moki in Koryo of the ivory plague.\n* Takegai Yodori acted as a courier for Takegai Uezami, the head of the council of state and a high-ranking member of the noble Takegai clan in Kozakura."
