'''''Create minor helm''''' was a [[spell]] that created a ''[[spelljamming helm|minor spelljamming helm]]''.
 
==Effects==
When cast, the caster altered a regular chair into a major spelljamming helm. This effect was temporary and was often reserved for emergencies. The spell was also infrequently used as it aged the caster by a whole year. The size of the [[spelljammer]] the helm could power was two times the caster's skill level.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], any seat suitable for use as a helm.
