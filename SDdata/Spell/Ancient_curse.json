        "mainbody": "Ancient curse was a spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the target of the spell, as well as their family, would suffer a long-term curse. This spell could only be cast on evil creatures or a creature whod performed an act of profound evil. The curse was bestowed by the shugenjas deity and the caster was required to be in the presence of the target. \nThe type of curse was chosen by the caster. Common curses were pestilence, haunting, crop failure, house fires, and suffering. The spell was long-term, lasting up to several centuries, and the negative effects were usually not immediate. Atonement was able to remove the curse.\nIf a caster attempted to cast this spell in the Phlogiston, the spell would fail.\nIn addition to a verbal component, the spell required two material components a small gong made of silver and the holy symbol of the shugenja."
