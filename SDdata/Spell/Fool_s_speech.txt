Fools speech was a wild magic alteration spell used by wild mages.
This spell allowed the caster and any selected targets to communicate in a secret language known only to them. The language would be incomprehensible to anyone else listening. Any desired targets of the spell needed to be touching the caster when the spell was cast. The recipients could still choose to speak normally while under the effect of fools speech.
Spells such as comprehend languages or tongues did not allow others to understand the fools speech. However, an individual wearing a helm of comprehending languages and reading magic would be able to understand the language.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small whistle of bone to cast.
