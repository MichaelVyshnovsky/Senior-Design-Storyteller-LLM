'''''Fool's speech''''' was a [[wild magic]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by [[wild mage]]s.

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster and any selected targets to communicate in a secret language known only to them. The language would be incomprehensible to anyone else listening. Any desired targets of the spell needed to be touching the caster when the spell was cast. The recipients could still choose to speak normally while under the effect of ''fool's speech''.

Spells such as ''[[comprehend languages]]'' or ''[[tongues]]'' did not allow others to understand the ''fool's speech''. However, an individual wearing a ''[[helm of comprehending languages and reading magic]]'' would be able to understand the language.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a small whistle of bone to cast.
