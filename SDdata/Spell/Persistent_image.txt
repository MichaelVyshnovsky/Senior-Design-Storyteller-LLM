'''''Persistent image''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that created a complex image that did not require concentration.

==Effect==
This spell worked the same as ''[[silent image]]'', but the figment created could have auditory (including intelligible speech), visual, olfactory, and thermal components. It was also animated as the caster directed, and proceeded without them needed to focus their attention on it.

==Components==
As well as [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, it required [[material component]]: several grains of [[sand]] and a small piece of [[fleece]].
