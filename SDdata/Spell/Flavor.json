        "mainbody": "Flavor was a useful cantrip that beginning wizards could learn. It altered or improved the taste of food or drink.\nThe target of this spell had to be within  of the caster. This cantrip only changed the perceived taste of food or drink. A bowl of mush could be made to taste like lobster, but it still looked, felt, and poured like mush. Flavor did not remove spoilage, change texture, or improve nutrition, but could be used to disguise the taste of spoiled food or the taint of poison.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster made a shaking motion with a hand while smacking his or her lips."
