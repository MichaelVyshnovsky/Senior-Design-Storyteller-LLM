'''''Smokepuff''''' was a personal cantrip that initiate wizards could learn. It created a small amount of smoke in a small selection of colors.

==Effects==
This spell created a puff of smoke about {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} in diameter at a distance of up to {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} from the caster. Once created, it immediately became susceptible to the prevailing conditions. In a calm room, the smoke rose toward the ceiling as typical, but a breeze would scatter and dissipate it. The caster could choose the color of the smoke as either white, black, gray, brown, green, or yellow.

==Components==
This cantrip require [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s. The caster extended a hand horizontally and spoke the desired color, then blew out a breath of air and raised the hand to the vertical.

==History==
The untitled book known as ''[[Briel's Book of Shadows]]'' described this cantrip,{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|34}} including how to shape the smoke into rings.<ref group="note">The four cantrips described in [[Dragon magazine 97|''Dragon'' #97]] were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''.
