'''''Create frenzy dog''''' was an evil [[druid]] spell used by certain druids in the forest of [[Chondalwood]] to transform almost any animal into a [[frenzy dog]], a magically enhanced creature.

Although the spell caused a corruption in nature to create the frenzy dog, druids justified this by their use of these creatures in the protection of their forest environment. The spell was barely known outside the Chondalwood and the druids used it sparingly because they were aware of the potential damage large numbers of frenzy dogs would cause.{{Cite web/Dogs in the Forgotten Realms}}
