        "mainbody": "'''''A day in the life''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Yondalla]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell transformed a sentient living creature into a regular [[halfling]]. The now transformed individual retained their memories, mental faculties, personality and [[alignment]]. Any equipment or weapons carried by the individual before the transformation were not altered. Once transformed, the recipient was unable to cast spells or use psionic abilities. They returned to normal once the spell expired.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the [[holy symbol]] of Yondalla and a single hair from the foot of a halfling."
