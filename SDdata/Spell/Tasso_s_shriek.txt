Tassos shriek was an arcane illusion spell that was a form of audible glamer.
Minimal utterance from the caster was needed to cast this spell, making it practically silent and untraceable. The caster uttered the desired sounds during the casting and the sounds could not be altered or cut short once the spell was cast. They would continue to be uttered until the spell expired.
This spell required only Verbal components to cast.
This spell was found in the tome Tassos Arcanabula.
