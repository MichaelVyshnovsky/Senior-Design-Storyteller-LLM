        "mainbody": "Combust was an arcane evocation spell that allowed the caster to make any item or creature they touched burst into flames.\nDepending on whether it was naturally flammable, the affected item, or creature/person if they were wearing combustible clothes and items, would continue to burn after being ignited. Some creatures were able to avoid this, if they reacted quickly enough. Items that could naturally burn would continue to do so until they were put out, though this might also cause the fire to spread.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, a drop of oil and a piece of flint were the required material components to cast this spell."
