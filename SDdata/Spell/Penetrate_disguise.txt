Penetrate disguise was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur.
A shugenja used this spell to see through a disguise. It only worked on non-magical disguises, such as makeup, masks and clothing. The spell also allowed the shugenja to determine if the creature was under the influence of a friends spell. The spell did not penetrate magical disguises or illusions, and was unable to determine alignments or intentions.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
