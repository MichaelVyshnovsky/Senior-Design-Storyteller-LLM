        "mainbody": "'''''Wondercraft''''' was an extremely powerful [[spell]] that copied [[magic item]]s.",
        "Effects": "On casting the spell, a mage automatically created, without the need for an object to enchant or for many material components, a copy of an item they had created or whose properties they had handled within a year and a half, maybe more for more powerful wizards.\n\nEach property had a chance not to manifest, inversely proportional to the [[mage]]'s ability to manage dangerous magic; even those that did had a chance of over one in four to be twisted into something else, something random, and for objects with more than two properties, the chance quickly escalated into near-certainty.\n\nThe caster's health was damaged by the spell. Though it was temporary, unlike that of a ''[[permanency]]'', it increased exponentially if more than one such spell was used within 24 hours- no one would survive casting it four times.\n\nThe items lasted for at least 18 years; there was no way whatsoever to make them last longer.",
        "Components": "Besides [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required three drops of water, three drops of dew or a flask of captured mist, three stones of any size, and three pinches of ash from a fire. All of those had to have been touched by magic at some point.",
        "History": "[[Azuth]] made this spell available through [[Elminster]] sometime prior to {{yearlink|1370}}.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|101}}"
