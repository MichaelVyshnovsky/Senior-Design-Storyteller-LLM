The boon affected their combat prowess, their ability to perform skilled tasks and their resilience towards certain spells, spell-like abilities, and other harmful effects.\nThe specifications of this spell appeared upon the Flame of the Spirit when it assumed its tablet form.\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast."
