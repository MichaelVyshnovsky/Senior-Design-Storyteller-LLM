Sarkons umbral simulacrum was a shadow magic spell that allowed a mage to create an exact duplicate of a person from shadowstuff. It was presumably created by Sarkon.This is assumed from the name. Owing to the shared names, it is likely that Sarkon also compiled the Sarkonagael.
The only known source of the spell was the Sarkonagael, a tome of shadow magic. The book was highly sought after and was recovered twice for large rewards by the rogue Jack Ravenwild of Ravens Bluff. At one point, he cut the spells four pages from the book to prevent it being used against him.
