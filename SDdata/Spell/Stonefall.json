        "mainbody": "Stonefall was a spell used by clerics of Dumathoin.\nWhen cast, this spell triggered rocky materials to fall. If cast underground or in a cave, the spell caused cave-ins or large stalactites to fall from the cavern ceiling. If cast indoors, the spell caused the ceiling to collapse, if it was made from stone. Even if cast outdoors, a stone the size of a fist fell from the sky on a targeted creature.\nStonefall was often used alongside the stonefire spell cast by clerics of Moradin.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a handful of large pebbles or stones."
