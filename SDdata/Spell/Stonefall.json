        "mainbody": "'''''Stonefall''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Dumathoin]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell triggered rocky materials to fall. If cast underground or in a cave, the spell caused cave-ins or large stalactites to fall from the cavern ceiling. If cast indoors, the spell caused the ceiling to collapse, if it was made from stone. Even if cast outdoors, a stone the size of a fist fell from the sky on a targeted creature.\n\n''Stonefall'' was often used alongside the ''[[stonefire (spell)|stonefire]]'' spell cast by clerics of [[Moradin]].",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], a handful of large pebbles or stones."
