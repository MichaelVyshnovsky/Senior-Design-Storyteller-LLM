        "mainbody": "Immunity to adherence was an arcane spell used in the Underdark, which would allow the target to become temporarily immune to both natural and magical web-like materials.This spell did not allow passage through existing magical webs acting as gates, or to free those already stuck in web-like materials. For a spell which allowed for this, see the higher-level passweb spell.\nThe spell would work on any creature that the caster touched, including themselves. Once the spell was cast, the recipient could move through the web-like material, as if there was no material clinging to them at all.\nThe types of materials affected by the spell were natural and magical webs, mimic pseudopods, cave fisher filaments, quicksand, and viscid globs.\nAs well as verbal and somatic components, the material components consisted of a windborn seed and a drop of either alcohol, water, tears, or saliva."
