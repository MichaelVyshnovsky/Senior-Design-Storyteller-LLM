Thunderstroke was a divine evocation spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Anhur called Militars.
The spell summoned the wrath of Anhur in the form of a bolt of lightning to strike a single target.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the Militars holy symbol to cast.
