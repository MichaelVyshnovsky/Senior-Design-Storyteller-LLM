        "mainbody": "Enduring ward was a divine alteration spell used only by specialty priestesses devoted to Nephthys called Goodwives and resembled the permanency wizard spell..\nThe spell made any glyph of warding, symbol or wards sphere spell permanent if cast after those spells. Enduring ward affected only one spell at a time. The enduring ward could be negated by either a dispel magic or Mordenkainens disjunction spell, but the actual warding spell or symbol remained intact for its normal duration.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a crushed diamond worth at least 200 gp to cast."
