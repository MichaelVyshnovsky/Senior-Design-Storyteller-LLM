'''''Ethereal visage''''' was a protective [[illusion]] [[spell]] cast by [[Bard|bards]], [[Sorcerer|sorcerers]], and [[Wizard|wizards]]. The spell created a nimbus of ghostly light around the caster.

==Effects==
The spell was an improved version of the spell ''[[ghostly visage]]'', and much like it, the ghostly nimbus created by this spell protected the caster in various ways. It canceled the effects of any spell that wasn't more powerful than ''ghostly visage'', as well as making the caster harder to hit. Even the hits that did land had very little effect unless the enemy used a magical weapon at least thrice as powerful as that created by a [[Magic weapon (spell)|''magic weapon'']] spell.

==Components==
The spell required only a  [[Somatic component|somatic]] component to cast.
