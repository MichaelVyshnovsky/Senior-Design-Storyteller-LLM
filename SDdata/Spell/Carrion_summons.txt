'''''Carrion summons''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a portal in a location chosen by the caster. The location had to be within {{SI|40|yd}} of the caster. Once created, the portal summoned either an individual or a pair of [[carrion crawler]]s. Once summoned, the carrion crawlers were then transformed by the spell to become larger and more deadly. The caster had control over the carrion crawlers. If they were not killed by the time the spell expired, the carrior crawlers were transformed back to their normal size and were returned their place of origin.
