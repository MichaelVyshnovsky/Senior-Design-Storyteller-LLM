'''''Bil's blasting ball''''' was a little-known spell of sardonic nature created by the [[wizard]] [[Bil]] long before [[1261 DR]].

==History==
''Bil's blasting ball'' was developed by a wizard of small repute Bil, who was mostly known for creating a highly sought after [[jade]] ''[[shield ring]]''. He disappeared from the Realms in 1261 DR, and all of his belongings and works were scavenged by his acquaintances of ill repute and sold off to the highest bidder.
