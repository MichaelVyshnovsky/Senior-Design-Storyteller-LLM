        "mainbody": "Morale was a spell used by clerics.\nThis spell had two distinct effects. The first effect increased the morale of multiple creatures for a short period of time. The caster could target any group that was within sight and  from the caster.\nThe second effect increased the morale of a group of creatures for significantly longer, up to a day. This effect required more preparation on the part of the caster and had to be cast within  of a holy place dedicated to the casters deity.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a gem with a value of at least 100 gp. It was destroyed after casting the spell.\nMorale was one of the spells that the Flame of the Spirit might show devotees of Tymora."
