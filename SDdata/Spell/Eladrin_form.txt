Eladrin form was an arcane transmutation spell that transformed the caster into an incorporeal globe.
The caster transformed themself into a globe of eldritch colors, around  wide. It could fly at up to  per minute with excellent maneuverability. Being incorporeal, the caster had no physical strength and could not attack physically, but could pass through solid obstructions such as walls and could only be harmed by other incorporeal creatures, enchanted weapons, magic and psionics, and attacks from most corporeal sources had only a 50% chance of success. While the caster could use innate magic and psionics themselves, they could not actually cast spells. This lasted 78 seconds, or longer for more experienced casters.
It had only a verbal component.
