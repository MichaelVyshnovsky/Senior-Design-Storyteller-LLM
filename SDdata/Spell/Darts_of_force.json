        "mainbody": "'''Darts of force''' was a [[spell]] that sent [[magic]]al projectiles towards a foe.",
        "Description": "The darts took the form of shafts of azure light that streaked towards an opponent.",
        "Components": "''Darts of force'' only required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s, with no need for a [[spell focus]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] often used such a spell. He tried to use it against the [[alhoon]] [[Syrzan]], but it failedâ€”the bolts stopped in the air, fell to the ground, and turned into leech- or tadpole-like things that crawled into a pool. This was because they were actually inside the [[illithid]]'s mind."
