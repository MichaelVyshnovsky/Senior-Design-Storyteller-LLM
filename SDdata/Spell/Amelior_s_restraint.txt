Ameliors restraint was a defensive arcane spell developed by the mage and sage Amelior Amanitas of Secomber. Presumably, the spell could be used by wizards.
When cast, Ameliors restraint disabled all special abilities, skills, and magics of a target creature. The spell continued the arcane restraint for a certain period of time of at least a single minute.
