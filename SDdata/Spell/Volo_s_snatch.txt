Volos snatch was a spell that could pick up and fly items to the casters hand.
This spell allowed to caster to pick an item within sight, no larger than their own fist in size, and fling it from a distance towards their own hand. It could not break loose items secured by chains, rings, or hasps.
Volothamp Geddarm, the inventor of the spell, mostly used this spell to steal tarts, though he occasionally used it to get out of sticky situations by obtaining keys, weapons, or tools. In one instance, he used Volos snatch to hurriedly dress himself in lingerie while escaping a paramours husband through a shop.
Although Volothamp hadnt spread Volos snatch around, several other spellcasters were inspired to devise their own equivalent spells, though these were generally flawed in some way compared to the original.
