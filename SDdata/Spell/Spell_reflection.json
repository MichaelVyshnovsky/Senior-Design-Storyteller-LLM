        "mainbody": "'''''Spell reflection''''' was an obscure [[incantation]] [[spell]] that caused incoming spells to bounce back on their casters. It was known mostly only by [[flameskull]]s.<ref group=\"note\">This ability of flameskulls was removed in later editions, so counterparts for this spell are unknown.",
        "Effects": "''Spell reflection'' caused all spells reaching the target to be returned to their caster. If the spell did damage, the caster would suffer it; otherwise, the spell was negated.",
        "Components": "It required only a [[verbal component]], making it useful for flameskulls.",
        "History": "''Spell reflection'' was lost or long forgotten to most mages, and only remembered by old [[flameskull]]s in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Notable Users": "* The [[Lichlord]], a [[lich]] who sought to avert [[Karsus's Folly]] by conquering [[Netheril]], had his clothing enchanted with ''spell reflection''."
