        "mainbody": "'''''Kiss of the vampire''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell allowed the caster to temporarily take on the powers of a [[vampire]]. The caster's appearance was modified, becoming lean and pale, their eyes changed to deep red in color. The caster was able to use, as part of this spell, ''[[charm person]]''. ''[[enervation]]'', ''[[gaseous form]]'' and ''[[vampiric touch]]''.\n\nWhile in this state, if any ''inflict''-type spells are cast on the caster, they healed them. Conversely, if any ''cure''-type spells were cast, they harmed the caster. The caster became vulnerable to any spell that affected [[undead]] creatures. If the caster charmed a creature, the charm effect ended when the spell expired. The duration of the spell was determined by the caster's skill level.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a piece of black [[onyx]] with a value of at least 50 [[gp]]. It had to have an image of a fang-toothed visage carved upon it."
