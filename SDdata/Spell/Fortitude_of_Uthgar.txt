Fortitude of Uthgar was a divine enchantment spell used by specialty priests devoted to Uthgar, enabling them to endure pain beyond their norm.
Shamans of Uthgar used this spell on themselves and members of this tribe.
This spell boosted the physical and mental fortitude of the recipient, allowing them endure pain with courage. The recipient also found it easier to resist spells that affected their mind. The spell would last for several days, depending on the skill of the shaman, so long as they carried a beast totem on their person for the spells duration.
In addition to verbal components and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol to cast.
