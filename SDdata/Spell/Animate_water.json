        "mainbody": "Animate water was a simple spell common to the wu jen of Kara-Tur also utilized this spell.\nThe caster could use this spell to animate, within a close range, an amount of water with a volume between about 500 and 900 gallons (1.8 and 3.4 kiloliters), though some scholars of magic claimed that the maximum volume depended on the power of the caster. The water would remain animated, as long as the caster concentrated, for up to twelve seconds or longer, depending on the power of the caster.\nThe animated water would attack whomever the caster designated, behaving much like a small water elemental, and crashing against an opponent like a little wave. The caster could not shape the water but only control the direction in which it flowed. The animated water could move about as fast as a human it could move uphill but not up steep surfaces like walls or even stairs.\nThe spell took a full six seconds to cast. Animate water could not be cast at all within the phlogiston between the crystal spheres.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components and a material component&mdasha mixture of pure, spring water and cinnabar oil in a small vial."
