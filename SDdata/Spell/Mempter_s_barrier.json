        "mainbody": "'''''Mempter's barrier''''' was a defensive [[evocation]] [[spell]] from the 6{{th}} circle of magic that was somewhat similar to the ''[[wall of force]]'' [[arcane magic]] spell, developed by the powerful [[elementalist]] [[Mempter]].",
        "Effects": "''Mempter's barrier'' conjured forth a magical force field, similar to the one created via ''wall of force'', but, unlike it, ''Mempter's barrier'' allowed one-pay passage through. It allowed creature from the inside of the barrier to attack through with weapons, spells, or ranged arms, pass though, but not back, also blocking anything that was trying to penetrate it from the outside, including projectile spells, missiles, and creatures. The magical barrier was immovable and invisible, and could be erected at the distance of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} from the caster, and its dimensions were a cube or a sphere of up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} squared, increasing with the caster's powers. The duration, like the size, increased with the caster's magical prowess growing. The caster could end the spell at will.\n\n''Mempter's barrier'' was unaffected by ''[[dispel magic]]'' and most other spells. It was immune to any physical, cold, heat, lightning, dragon's breath, and other types of damage. The barrier immediately disappeared is hit with the ''[[disintegrate]]'', spell or via the use of a ''[[sphere of annihilation]]'' or a ''[[rod of cancellation]]''.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s to be cast. Its material component was powdered [[diamond]] worth of 5,000 [[gp]], and a [[mirror]]ed [[lens]].",
        "History": "''Mempter's barrier'' was the creation of the mysterious [[human]], by some accords, or a [[Djen]] of [[Calimshan]], by others. The wizard settled in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], already possessing the knowledge of the ''Mempter's barrier'' spell."
