It allowed creature from the inside of the barrier to attack through with weapons, spells, or ranged arms, pass though, but not back, also blocking anything that was trying to penetrate it from the outside, including projectile spells, missiles, and creatures. The magical barrier was immovable and invisible, and could be erected at the distance of  from the caster, and its dimensions were a cube or a sphere of up to  squared, increasing with the casters powers. The duration, like the size, increased with the casters magical prowess growing. The caster could end the spell at will.\nMempters barrier was unaffected by dispel magic and most other spells. It was immune to any physical, cold, heat, lightning, dragons breath, and other types of damage. The barrier immediately disappeared is hit with the disintegrate, spell or via the use of a sphere of annihilation or a rod of cancellation.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and material components to be cast. Its material component was powdered diamond worth of 5,000 gp, and a mirrored lens.\nMempters barrier was the creation of the mysterious human, by some accords, or a Djen of Calimshan, by others. The wizard settled in the city of Ravens Bluff in the mid-to-late 14 century DR, already possessing the knowledge of the Mempters barrier spell."
