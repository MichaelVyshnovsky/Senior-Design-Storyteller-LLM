        "mainbody": "'''''Dragon blight''''' was a spell that was used against [[dragon]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, a shimmering green cloud enveloped a target dragon. The dragon, and any other dragonkind within the cloud, experienced excruciating pain, a pain so intense that any creature within was left stunned after the spell expired.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components. However, if the caster included a claw from a [[deep dragon]] while casting the spell, it  increased the likelihood of the spell stunning the targeted dragon."
