        "mainbody": "Disquietude was a spell used by bards.\nThis spell took the form of either a poem or a song. If a creature heard it, they were overcome with an intense feeling of paranoia. This caused the inflicted creature to become anxious and avoid physical contact with those around them. If attacked, the paranoia caused them to flee.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
