Resist acid and corrosion was an abjuration spell that improved the subjects defense against caustic substances for a few minutes.
The caster had to touch the subject in order to bestow this protection. This spell made the subject immune to mild acids and more resistant to strong acids and corrosive substances such as the excretions of oozees, slimes, jellies, and puddings, Melfs acid arrows, and black dragon breath. If exposed to a strong corrosive agent, the subject took only half the usual amount of damage and this spell gave the subject an increased chance to resist the attack, further reducing the damage to one=quarter the normal amount.
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.
