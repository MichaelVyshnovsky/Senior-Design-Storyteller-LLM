        "mainbody": "'''''Sphere of ultimate destruction''''' is a very powerful [[sorcerer]] and [[wizard]] spell that conjures a featureless black sphere of nothingness that destroys everything in its path.",
        "Effects": "Creatures who are struck by the sphere have a slim chance of surviving, but will most likely be disintegrated, along with any non-living matter. Upon striking a creature, the sphere will stop moving and wait to be directed to a new target by its caster. If the sphere moves beyond the range of the spell, it winks out of existence.",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a pinch of dust from a disintegrated creature.",
        "History": "The history of this spell is unknown, but it was in common use in the [[Unapproachable East]] some time around [[1373 DR]]."
