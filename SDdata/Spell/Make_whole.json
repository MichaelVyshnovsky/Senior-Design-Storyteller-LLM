        "mainbody": "'''''Make whole''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[transmutation]] spell that physically repaired an object, within limits. There was also a [[ritual]] by the same name that [[arcanist]]s could use for the same purpose.",
        "Effects": "This spell was similar to ''[[mending]]'' but could repair multiple breaks at once. ''Make whole'' worked on objects that were physically damaged as if by violence. It could not restore items that had been ''[[disintegrate]]d'', burned, or vaporized, nor could it reconstitute a [[gem]] that had been ground to powder, straighten a wooden curtain rod bent by long years of heavy use, or reform a coin that had been melted down. This spell also did not work on living creatures or [[construct]]s. Magical items could be physically repaired, but no magical properties or abilities were restored by this spell.\n\nThe ritual required that the object be no larger than a 10 ft (3 m) cube. The divine version could operate on any shape object, but its total volume was limited. More experienced clerics could repair larger objects.",
        "Components": "No components were required to cast the divine version of this spell. valued at some fraction of the cost of the object to be repaired, typically twenty percent."
