'''''Persistence''''' was a powerful spell that allowed a caster to save a [[spell]].

==Effects==
The spell allowed a caster to cast a spell but then delay it until needed. Although spells that rely on a duration were unable to be delayed with this spell, spells that were cast instantaneously could be held. A caster was unable to cast this spell more than once at a time. If a spell was already held by the spell, and if the caster cast a different spell, it replaces the former one. This spell could be used to increase a caster's natural spell casting abilities.

==Casting==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a [[material component]], an intricately worked chalice made from crystal. The chalice has to have a value of at least 2,000 [[gp]].
==History==
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].
