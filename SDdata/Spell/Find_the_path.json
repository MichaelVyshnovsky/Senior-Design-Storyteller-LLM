        "Effects": "This spell had a simple concept: show the way to a specific point. Non-specific requests like \"a place where [[bulette]]s roam free\" would not be accepted. The caster had to touch the recipient of this spell.\n\nAll pre-[[Spellplague]] versions lasted about two hours (more for casters with more experience) but they showed traps, gave passwords for glyphs, and even cancelled the ''[[maze]]'' spell. The target location had to be on the same plane of existence.\n\nWhen cast in reverse, ''lose the path'' caused the recipient to be hopelessly lost and unable to find an intended destination without aid.\n\nThe post-[[Second Sundering]] version worked much the same way, except it could not be granted to someone else and did not reveal traps, but could last a whole day.\n\nWhen cast on [[Avernus]], the first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], an [[imp]] appeared and was forced to guide the caster to the requested location, but it did so grudgingly and whined and complained the whole way. The imp disappeared as soon as possible upon reaching the destination, or when the spell duration was up, which ever came first.",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a focus a set of divination counters of the sort favored by the caster: bones, ivory counters, sticks, carved runes, etc. The post-Second Sundering version also demanded that they be worth at least 100 [[gold piece]]s, along with an item from the desired location."
