Analyze balance was an common divine spell granted to clerics by their deities.
The spell could be cast as any creature, item, or area as the distance not greater than . Analyze balance allowed the caster to feel how far the Balance diverted in the target from the absolute center, true neutrality. The caster could determine whether the target was good or evil, lawful or chaotic in nature. However, the spell had some limitations. The caster felt the deviation from neutrality, but when the deviation happened on both alignment axes, precise determination became significantly less clear.
This spell did not reveal mundane nor magical traps, and when cast on a beast or dim-witted creatures of animal intelligence, always registered as neutral.
Individuals who found themselves in the Domains of Dread could notice that the effectiveness of the spell was dramatically reduced. Analyze balance could not determine whether the target had good or evil inclinations.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components components. The material component took the form of four iron coins that were not consumed by the spell. The priest was to toss these chains in their hands while concentrating on the casting.
