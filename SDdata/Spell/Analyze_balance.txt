'''''Analyze balance''''' was an common [[divine]] [[spell]] granted to [[cleric]]s by their deities.

==Effects==
The spell could be cast as any creature, item, or area as the distance not greater than {{SI|80'|'"|long=yes}}. ''Analyze balance'' allowed the caster to feel how far [[the Balance]] diverted in the target from the absolute center, [[true neutral]]ity. The caster could determine whether the target was [[good]] or [[evil]], [[law]]ful or [[chaotic]] in nature. However, the spell had some limitations. The caster felt the deviation from neutrality, but when the deviation happened on both [[alignment]] axes, precise determination became significantly less clear.

This spell did not reveal mundane nor magical traps, and when cast on a beast or dim-witted creatures of animal intelligence, always registered as neutral.

Individuals who found themselves in the [[Domains of Dread]] could notice that the effectiveness of the spell was dramatically reduced. ''Analyze balance'' could not determine whether the target had good or evil inclinations.<ref>

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s components. The material component took the form of four [[iron]] [[coin]]s that were not consumed by the spell. The [[priest]] was to toss these chains in their hands while concentrating on the casting.

==Notable Users==
===Organizations===
*[[Mazewalker]]s, the specialty [[cleric]]s of [[Chultan]] deity [[Ubtao]] were granted the ability to ''analyze balance'' early on in their training.
*All priests and [[druid]]s of [[Mielikki]] were granted a divine ability to cast the ''analyze balance'' at will while they remained within a forest. Unlike the regular spell, this variation allowed the caster to determine the balance within the entire forest.
*''[[Vorthryn's Archivir]]'', a holy [[book]] of the [[Church of Azuth]], contained the ''analyze balance'' spell, among many others.
