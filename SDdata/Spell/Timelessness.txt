Timelessness was a powerful divine alteration spell from the numbers sphere that stopped time for one target.
The target of timelessness froze in place for the duration of the spell which lasted for several days depending on the skill of the casting priest. The spells duration was spoken during the casting. The subject was incapable of thinking or moving and could not be affected by any physical or magical means. The subject did not age while the spell was active.
Timelessness was an incredibly taxing spell to cast and had a small chance of permanently negatively affecting the casters general health.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
The Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the Mystran faith, could cast the timelessness spell.
