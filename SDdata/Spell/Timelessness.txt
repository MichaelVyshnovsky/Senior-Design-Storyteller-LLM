'''''Timelessness''''' was a powerful [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[numbers sphere]] that stopped time for one target.

==Effects==
The target of ''timelessness'' froze in place for the duration of the spell which lasted for several days depending on the skill of the casting [[priest]]. The spell's duration was spoken during the casting. The subject was incapable of thinking or moving and could not be affected by any physical or [[magic]]al means. The subject did not age while the spell was active.

''Timelessness'' was an incredibly taxing spell to cast and had a small chance of permanently negatively affecting the caster's general health.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.

==History==
The ''[[Scepter of Mystra]]'', a relic of the [[Mystra]]n faith, could cast the ''timelessness'' spell.{{cite book/Prayers from the Faithful|77-80}}
