'''''Nybor's joyful voyage''''' was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] that ''[[teleport]]ed'' an individual a number of miles in a random direction.

==Effects==
Upon casting, this spell instantaneously transported its target anywhere from one to 100 miles in a random direction, from west, north, east, south, or anywhere in between, as well as diagonally or straight up or down. The latter two possible destinations could place them a deep within [[Toril]], embedded in solid stone, falling from the sky or even within the nearest reaches of [[realmspace]].

==History==
The spell was invented by the 13{{th}} century [[Red Wizard]], [[Zulkir]] [[Nybor]], and the "joy" in the spell's name referred to that felt by the [[spellcaster]] upon seeing the effects of their magic.{{Cite web/Nybor's Small Codex}}
