'''''Mace of Odo''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Helm]].

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a force [[mace]] in one of the caster's hands. The mace glowed and looked like a regular mace. Creatures struck by the mace were temporarily paralyzed. It was particularly effective against [[undead]] creatures. The mace was able to absorb some spells cast upon the caster. The caster was able to continue casting spells while wielding the mace. The mace vanished if the caster no longer wielded it, it absorbed a spell or was used against a creature. After it vanished, a glowing light similar to a ''[[light]]'' spell remained for a short time.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[divine focus]].

==History==
This spell was found in the ''[[The Hand of Helm]]''.
