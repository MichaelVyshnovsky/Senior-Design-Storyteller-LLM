Mace of Odo was a spell used by clerics of Helm.
When cast, this spell created a force mace in one of the casters hands. The mace glowed and looked like a regular mace. Creatures struck by the mace were temporarily paralyzed. It was particularly effective against undead creatures. The mace was able to absorb some spells cast upon the caster. The caster was able to continue casting spells while wielding the mace. The mace vanished if the caster no longer wielded it, it absorbed a spell or was used against a creature. After it vanished, a glowing light similar to a light spell remained for a short time.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a divine focus.
This spell was found in the The Hand of Helm.
