Acid splash, also known as acid orb, was a conjuration spell used by sorcerers and wizards.
After the  Second Sundering, when acid splash was cast, the sorcerer or wizard conjured a sphere of liquid acid which, when thrust at a target, collided and exploded, burning one creature with its contents. The spell was easily cast and one needed not rest before recasting it. The potency of the spells effects also increased over time, dependent both on the sorcerers level of experience as well as, as in the case of most sorcerer spells, the sorcerers strength of personality.
Like other spells, acid splash could only be cast as many times as its caster either had energy left for spellcasting or, in the case of wizards, had prepared for it.
This spell required verbal and somatic components.
