Dying curse was a protection spell of the southern magic tradition that allowed a caster to have vengeance after death.
Anyone who killed the caster would suffer the effects of a major curse spell. The spell took effect even if the caster was later resurrected. The curse was permanent until it was removed.
The only way to remove the curse was by a wish, remove bane, or remove major curse spell.
This spell required verbal and somatic components.
