        "Components": "The ritual of course required severed hands, specifically left hands, that the caster intended to turn into crawling claws, and powerful casters could conceivably animate dozens of hands at a time. Preparation for the spell first required the casting of ''[[magic circle against good]]'' around both the caster and the severed hands, although this circle merely needed to be in place for the beginning of the ritual. The ritual itself took an hour to complete, requiring [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] casting as well as the fingernail clippings of a [[ghoul]] and a lost or stolen [[ring]] as the [[Material component|material]] components."
