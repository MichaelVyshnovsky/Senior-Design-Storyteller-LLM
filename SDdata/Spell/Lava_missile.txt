The lava missile spell shot forth a projectile of lava, that struck unerringly at a target designated by the caster.
Less experienced priests casting lava missile conjured forth a single projectile wheres more powerful divine spellcasters summoned up to five.
When the missile reached its target it set them aflame, unless they could resist the effect or were otherwise immune. If cast against a firenewt, a lava missile would actually heal their wounds, as opposed to harming them.
The spell was developed and first used by firenewt clerics of Kossuth.
