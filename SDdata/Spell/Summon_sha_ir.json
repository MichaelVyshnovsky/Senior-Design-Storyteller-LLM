        "mainbody": "Summon shair was a conjuration spell used by genie wizards to compel service from an abusive shair. This spell was useless when cast upon any target who was not a shair.\nTypically genies would only use this spell against shairs who abused their gen, created too many magical items, bound an excessive number of genies within genie prisons, or if the shair displayed similar malcontent toward geniekind. Genies could not use this spell against a shair simply because they wanted to. The spell would not take effect unless several warning signs were triggered by the shairs behavior.\nFor this spell to work, the genie caster needed to possess one of the shairs personal items. This item was usually acquired by intimidating the shairs gen while it was traveling on the native elemental plane of the genie caster while fetching a spell for its master. A gen who agreed to help the genie acquire the item delivered on the promise the next time the shair sent it off in search of a spell. Any personal belonging of the shair would satisfy the requirements of the spell.\nWhen cast upon a shair, the nature and number of violations against geniekind that the shair committed increased the chance of the spells success. A shair under the influence of this spell was forced to serve the genie caster for several weeks depending on the skill of the caster.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a personal item of the target in order to cast."
