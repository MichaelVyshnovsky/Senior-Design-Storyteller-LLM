Shield of Lathander was a spell used by clerics of Lathander.
When cast, this spell protected the caster or a targeted individual from physical attacks by magical weapons. The protected individual was still vulnerable to the magical enhancement of magical weapons.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , Chief Prelate Dayspring of the Clerical Circle of Ravens Bluff declared it illegal for priests to cast shield of Lathander within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm, threatening arrest for those that broke this decree.
