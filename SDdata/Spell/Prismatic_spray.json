        "mainbody": "Prismatic spray was an evocation spell that could affect multiple targets with a variety of effects.\nA cone of multicolored rays emanated from the casters hand, hitting creatures in their paths at random. Multiple rays could hit the same target. There were seven possible colors, each either dealing damage from a different element or causing a different effect\n Red  Inflicted fire damage.\n Orange  Inflicted acid damage.\n Yellow  Inflicted lightning damage.\n Green  Inflicted poison damage.\n Blue  Inflicted cold damage.\n Indigo  A creature affected by this ray became paralyzed and was subsequently turned to stone.\n Violet  A creature struck by this ray became blind, and could be subsequently banished to another plane.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Anglin of Seventon in  and was originally called Anglins spray.\nDuring the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, Luna confronted the false avatar of Sel√ªne and the two broke into a spell-battle. Luna tried a prismatic spray, but it could not penetrate the others magical defenses."
