'''''Wondrous web''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to fill a prepared item with [[magic]]al powers.

==Casting==
A [[mage]] or [[wizard]] casting ''wondrous web'' would form a physical connection between the receiving and donating item, using their body as a channel. Magic could be drained from [[potion]]s, [[arcane]] [[scroll]]s, ''[[focal stone]]s'', existing [[Item enchantment|magical items]] or items that have been magically inscribed with [[rune magic]] or a [[command word]].

==Effects==
The effects of this spell were a buzzing plexus of white light between the items transferring magical energy. This would continue until the end of ''wondrous web's'' duration, whereupon the light and donating magical item would fade away.

This process could be stopped by a casting of ''[[dispel magic]]'', or a properly worded ''[[wish]]'' or ''[[limited wish]]''.

==Components==
The material components for this spell were six strands of [[spidersilk]] and a piece of either a fishing [[net]] or lace.
