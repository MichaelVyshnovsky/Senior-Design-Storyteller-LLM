        "mainbody": "'''''Deathshroud''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]] from the school of [[necromancy]] that surrounded the caster with life-draining magic from the [[Negative Energy plane]].",
        "Powers": "The [[undead]] and magical constructs were not affected by a ''deathshroud'', but anyone else coming into contact with it were physically drained of energy by a ''death haze'' that would kill them within minutes. The spell's duration lasted for several minutes depending on the caster's skill.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a crushed black [[opal]] and [[diamond]] worth 5,000 [[gp]], dust from an incorporeal [[undead]] with ties to the Negative Energy plane, and a chunk of smoky [[quartz]] to cast. All components were consumed during the casting.",
        "History": "This spell was found within the ''[[Book of Shadows]]'', a [[tome]] based upon the oration of the [[necromancer]] [[Nebt Bhakau]] of [[Zakhara]]."
