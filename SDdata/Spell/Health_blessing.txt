Health blessing was a special necromancy quest spell.
When cast, this spell provided protection from ill health to humans as well as demihuman and humanoid species. The spell provided temporary immunity to mundane diseases and illnesses. It also provided protection from poisons and death-based magic. In addition, they could cast cure light wounds once per day on themselves and heal another creature once per day in a fashion similar to how a paladin provides healing.
The spell was available to clerics of Karsus.
