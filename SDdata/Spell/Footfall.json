        "Effects": "This cantrip produced the auditory illusion of footsteps within a radius of {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} from the caster.<ref group=\"note\">The description of this cantrip in [[Dragon magazine 60|''Dragon'' #60]] used the notation <code>2\"</code> which can be interpreted as {{SI|20|yd|long=yes}}, but the ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' chose this to be {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} instead. The sound appeared to originate within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the caster and then moved wherever the caster desired as determined by the [[somatic]] gesture. The footsteps could be made to approach, recede, follow, stop, start, and so on. The volume of the illusory tread could vary from soft to somewhat noisy.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and somatic components to cast. The caster subvocalized the sound of footsteps while pointing at the location from which the sound appeared to emanate."
