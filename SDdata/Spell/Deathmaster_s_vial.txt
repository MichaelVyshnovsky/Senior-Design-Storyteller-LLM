Deathmasters vial was a rare spell used by necromancers.
This spell was centered on a vial containing a specially prepared liquid. When cast, the spell activated the liquid within the vial, which was then thrown towards a target. The vial shattered, covering a targeted creature in the liquid. As a result, parts of the creatures body began to rot. The vial had to be used within two hours after being exposed to sunlight but could be stored long-term in a dark location. If the vial was opened, the liquid within rapidly lost its power, becoming useless.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component the vial and the liquid within. The liquid was brewed by the caster beforehand. It was made by boiling the remains of either a ghast or a ghost, rendering them for a full 24 hours. Other ingredients were mixed in during the process. The caster was then able to fill about six small vials.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
