Sonic blast was a simple spell used by sorcerers and wizards.
When cast, the spell blasted a target with deafening, high-pitched noise. If a targeted individual lacked defenses against the spell, they risked temporary deafness. The spell was useless if cast in the area of effect of a silence spell.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components.
