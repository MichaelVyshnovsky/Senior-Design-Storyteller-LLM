        "mainbody": "'''''Word of radiance''''' was an [[evocation]] [[cantrip]] used by [[cleric]]s that seared nearby enemies with divine light.",
        "Effects": "By speaking a single divine word, the caster emitted a burst of radiance that burned selected creatures within a range of {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} that were unable to resist its effect. The intensity of the holy light increased as the cleric became more experienced and powerful.",
        "Components": "The spell required only a [[verbal component]] and the cleric's [[holy symbol]] as its [[material component]]."
