Spirit mask was a divine alteration spell used only by shamans devoted to Ubtao called spiritlords.
This spell allowed the spiritlord to entwine their spirit essence with that of a major or minor spirit. The spell diverted divination spells targeted on the caster to the entwined spirit for the spells duration, allowing the caster to misdirect any such intrusion for information.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the spiritlords holy symbol to cast.
