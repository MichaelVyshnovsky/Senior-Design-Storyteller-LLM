This spell did no damage nor disrupted concentration, it merely annoyed and possibly distracted the target creature for a few seconds. Tweak caused a light pinch, pull, or twist at a visible spot on the target creature, typically a beard, cheek, ear, mustache, nose, whiskers, or tail. If the target failed to resist the magic of this spell, they were distracted for a few seconds looking for the cause of the irritation. The greater the targets intelligence, the more likely they were to be distracted.It seems unlikely that beings of greater intelligence would be easier to distract, but Gygaxs description in the Dragon magazine article makes it impossible for a creature of 18 Intelligence to resist this cantrip. Later sources copied the same verbiage.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster pantomimed pinching and pulling with a thumb and forefinger while speaking a magical phrase, such as kitchy-kitchy-coo.
