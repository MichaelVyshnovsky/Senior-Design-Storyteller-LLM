'''''Tweak''''' was a personal [[cantrip]] that [[wizard]]s-in-training could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It conjured an invisible thumb and forefinger to harmlessly grab or pinch a spot on a target creature's body.

==Effects==
This cantrip could affect one creature within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}<ref group="note">The original description of this spell in [[Dragon magazine 60|''Dragon'' #60]] used the 1{{st}}-edition nomenclature <code>1"</code>, meaning {{SI|10|ft}} indoors and {{SI|10|yd}} outdoors. This was simplified to the shorter range in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. of the caster. This spell did no damage nor disrupted concentration, it merely annoyed and possibly distracted the target creature for a few seconds. ''Tweak'' caused a light pinch, pull, or twist at a visible spot on the target creature, typically a beard, cheek, ear, mustache, nose, whiskers, or tail. If the target failed to resist the magic of this spell, they were distracted for a few seconds looking for the cause of the irritation. The greater the target's intelligence, the more likely they were to be distracted.It seems unlikely that beings of greater intelligence would be easier to distract, but [[Gary Gygax|Gygax's]] description in the [[Dragon magazine|''Dragon'' magazine]] article makes it impossible for a creature of 18 Intelligence to resist this cantrip. Later sources copied the same verbiage.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster pantomimed pinching and pulling with a thumb and forefinger while speaking a magical phrase, such as ''kitchy-kitchy-coo''.
