        "mainbody": "Wildstrike was a wild magic conjuration spell used by wild mages.\nThis spell converted spell energy into wild surges, making it particularly useful against enemy spellcasters. Wildstrike surrounded the target with a field of wild magic. Any attempt by the target to cast a spell or use a magic item would result in a wild surge.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small glass tube to cast. The glass tube was shattered during the casting."
