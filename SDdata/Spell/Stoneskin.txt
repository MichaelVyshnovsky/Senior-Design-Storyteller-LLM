Stoneskin was an abjuration spell that turned a subjects skin stony in order to block blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes.
The target creature felt a brief tingling sensation before their skin, clothes, and hair took on a gray, stone-like appearance.
A creature warded by stoneskin was able to resist much of the damage caused by bludgeoning, cutting, stabbing, and slashing attacks. Only adamantine weapons, +5 weapons, and magical assaults could overcome it. Once the spell had blocked a certain amount of damage according to the casters level of power, it was discharged.
Halruaan jordains learned spells flaws and vulnerabilities to effectively combat mages. Stoneskin had one vital flaw that came from the natural magical world "like repelled like." When the stoneskin spell was cast by a person standing on a stone surface, the wizards soles rebuffed spells rock imitation. This left casters soles venerable to a well-placed strike.
In addition to the usual verbal and somatic components, casting stoneskin required a dust of granite and diamond (worth at least 250 gp) to be sprinkled over the skin of the being to be warded. 
Stoneskin was published in Volos Guide to All Things Magical and became generally known to the magical community. It was a commonly used spell in the mid–14th century DR.
In Waterdeep in the Year of the Prince, 1358 DR, Kyriani cast stoneskin on Onyx the Invincible to protect him from the raking talons of the marauding Aviss. However, Avisss partner  Fellandar hurled the dwarf through the wall of the Selûnes Smile, which discharged the spell.
