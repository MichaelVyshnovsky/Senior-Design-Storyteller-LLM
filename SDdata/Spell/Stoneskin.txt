'''''Stoneskin''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that turned a subject's skin stony in order to block blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes.
{{Quote|Ooh, nice shot! I almost felt that one.|A caster using stoneskin.{{Cite MTG|CLB|045|Stoneskin|[[Jake Murray]]}}}}

==Effects==
The target creature felt a brief tingling sensation before their skin, clothes, and hair took on a gray, stone-like appearance.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City|11, 13-14}}

A creature warded by ''stoneskin'' was able to resist much of the damage caused by bludgeoning, cutting, stabbing, and slashing attacks. Only [[adamantine]] weapons, ''+5'' weapons, and magical assaults could overcome it. Once the spell had blocked a certain amount of damage according to the caster's level of power, it was discharged.

[[Halruaan]] [[jordain]]s learned spells' flaws and vulnerabilities to effectively combat [[mage]]s. ''Stoneskin'' had one vital flaw that came from the natural magical world: "like repelled like." When the ''stoneskin'' spell was cast by a person standing on a stone surface, the wizard's soles rebuffed spell's rock imitation. This left caster's soles venerable to a well-placed strike.

==Components==
In addition to the usual verbal and somatic components, casting ''stoneskin'' required a dust of [[granite]] and [[diamond]] (worth at least 250 [[gp]]) to be sprinkled over the skin of the being to be warded. 

==History==
''Stoneskin'' was published in [[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|''Volo's Guide to All Things Magical'']] and became generally known to the magical community. It was a commonly used spell in the mid–14th century [[DR]].

In [[Waterdeep]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of the Prince, 1358 DR]], [[Kyriani]] cast ''stoneskin'' on [[Onyx the Invincible]] to protect him from the raking talons of the marauding [[Aviss]]. However, Aviss's partner  [[Fellandar]] hurled the [[dwarf]] through the wall of the [[Selûne's Smile]], which discharged the spell.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City|6}}
