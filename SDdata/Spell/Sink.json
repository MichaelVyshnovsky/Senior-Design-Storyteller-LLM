        "mainbody": "Sink was a powerful spell that could cause an opponent to sink into the ground, rendering it unable to move.\nThe spell was developed by Netherese arcanist Valdick in 2007 NY (−1852 DR) and was originally called Valdicks submerse.\nOriginally usable only arcanists and wizards, by 1370 DR it was known to the specialty priests of the Mulhorandi god Geb.\nDuring the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, Luna confronted the false avatar of Selûne, but she cast sink and caused her to fall into the ground. Luna escaped with a blink spell."
