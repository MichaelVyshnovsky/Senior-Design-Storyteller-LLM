'''''Under the Dark Fist''''' is a 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' adventure that describes the events of the [[War of the Spheres]] between the [[Free Space Alliance]] and the [[Vodoni Empire]].

{{Quote|''Few creatures inhabiting the realms of [[Greyspace]], [[Krynnspace]] and [[Realmspace]] know (or even dream) of each others' existence. Fewer still understand the celestial bonds they secretly share.''

''As the worlds of [[human|men]] and [[elf|elves]], [[dwarf|dwarves]] and [[dragons]] are about to discover, no less than ''TWELVE'' unknown [[Crystal sphere|spheres]] stand poised for war… a war as unexpected as it will be devastating!''

''Twelve spheres against three—hardly fair odds. But then again, Emperor [[Vulkaran]] the Dark, Master of the Twelve Spheres and Ruler of All Known Space, doesn't like a fair fight. He's never fought one yet!''

'''Under the Dark Fist''''', a 64-page adventure for the [[Spelljammer: AD&D Adventures in Space|''SPELLJAMMER™'']] setting, provides enough material to wage an intergalactic war across 15 spheres! It can be used as an epic stand-alone adventure or easily incorporated into an existing campaign. This challenging adventure is recommended for experienced players and referees.''

''This adventure is designed for a party of four to eight characters, levels 10 to 14.''}}
