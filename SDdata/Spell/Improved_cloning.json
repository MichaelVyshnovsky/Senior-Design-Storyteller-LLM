        "mainbody": "'''''Improved cloning''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]], an advanced iteration of the ''[[clone (spell)|clone]]'' spell, that allowed a caster to create multiple clones of a living creature.<ref name=ALAY-p24\" />",
        "Effects": "Unlike the original ''clone'' spell,<ref name=ALAY-p24\" /> which could only create a single [[clone]] at a time and took 2 to 8 months for a clone to develop, ''improved cloning'' allowed for the creation of up to eighteen clones that took only 2 to 8 hours to fully develop. These clones were able to coexist with each other peacefully,<ref name=ALAY-p24\" /><ref group=\"note\" name=\"power\">The original text states the spell \"creates 18 duplicates\", implying that eighteen are always created when the spell is used. However, in the adventure \"''Air's Looking at You''\" the spell's caster is able to create a smaller number of duplicates, exactly \"eight more pegasi,\" which implies that a caster can choose how many clones they wish to create. unlike the ''clone'' spell where clones were driven to destroy the original and were subject to madness if they were unable to.",
        "Components": "This spell shared all the same [[spell component]]s as ''clone''. This included [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s, the last in the form of a chunk of flesh from the creature being cloned.<ref name=ALAY-p24\" />",
        "History": "In the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR, a [[wild mage]] in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] by the name of [[Gideon]] attempted to create a talking figurine of a [[pegasus]] for Sergeant [[Tilernus Rockcrusher]] as a gift to [[Morra Starson]] so the guard could tell her how he felt. However, Gideon [[wild surge]]d when casting his [[enchantment]], turning the figurine into a ''[[figurine of wondrous power]]'' that activated and escaped.<ref name=ALAY-p6\">{{Cite organized play/LC/Air's Looking at You|6}} The [[silver]] pegasus was later discovered and captured by a group of rogue [[elementalist]]s known as the [[Circle of Four]]. One of their members, the [[air]] elementalist [[Mortimer Lightfoot]], used the ''improved cloning'' spell to create eight clones of it for use in their nefarious plans.<ref name=ALAY-p2\">{{Cite organized play/LC/Air's Looking at You|2}}\n\nMortimer Lightfoot later used the ''improved cloning'' spell to create multiple clones of himself, using one of them to fake his own death,{{Cite organized play/LC/Full Circle|3}} but modified the spell so that each of his clones would have part of their life force drained away every time they used their abilities.{{Cite organized play/LC/Full Circle|25}} A few years later he sent these clones out to conduct simultaneous assaults upon many of Ravens Bluff's temples, wanting to keep the city's defenders occupied and gradually weaken his clones so they would be unable to stand against him."
