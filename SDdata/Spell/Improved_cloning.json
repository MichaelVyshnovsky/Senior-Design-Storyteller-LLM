        "mainbody": "Improved cloning was a necromancy spell, an advanced iteration of the clone spell, that allowed a caster to create multiple clones of a living creature.\nUnlike the original clone spell, which could only create a single clone at a time and took 2 to 8 months for a clone to develop, improved cloning allowed for the creation of up to eighteen clones that took only 2 to 8 hours to fully develop. These clones were able to coexist with each other peacefully,The original text states the spell \"creates 18 duplicates\", implying that eighteen are always created when the spell is used. However, in the adventure \"Airs Looking at You\" the spells caster is able to create a smaller number of duplicates, exactly \"eight more pegasi,\" which implies that a caster can choose how many clones they wish to create. unlike the clone spell where clones were driven to destroy the original and were subject to madness if they were unable to.\nThis spell shared all the same spell components as clone. This included somatic, verbal, and material components, the last in the form of a chunk of flesh from the creature being cloned.\nIn the midâ€“14 century DR, a wild mage in the city of Ravens Bluff by the name of Gideon attempted to create a talking figurine of a pegasus for Sergeant Tilernus Rockcrusher as a gift to Morra Starson so the guard could tell her how he felt. However, Gideon wild surged when casting his enchantment, turning the figurine into a figurine of wondrous power that activated and escaped. The silver pegasus was later discovered and captured by a group of rogue elementalists known as the Circle of Four. One of their members, the air elementalist Mortimer Lightfoot, used the improved cloning spell to create eight clones of it for use in their nefarious plans.\nMortimer Lightfoot later used the improved cloning spell to create multiple clones of himself, using one of them to fake his own death, but modified the spell so that each of his clones would have part of their life force drained away every time they used their abilities. A few years later he sent these clones out to conduct simultaneous assaults upon many of Ravens Bluffs temples, wanting to keep the citys defenders occupied and gradually weaken his clones so they would be unable to stand against him."
