'''''Doom curse''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[necromantic sphere]] that [[curse]]d a target touched by the caster.

==Effects==
In addition to touching the target with their hand, the caster could also touch them with thrown items or weapons to affect the curse. The ''doom curse'' lasted for several days depending on the skill of the caster. The effects varied but some examples included ''[[slow]]ing'' the target, reducing their general vitality, making it impossible to speak clearly, the inability to properly hold and item, etc.

''Doom curse'' could be lifted by either casting ''[[remove curse]]'' or by the reverse ''[[lift doom]]''.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.

==History==
This rare spell was used only by [[dwarves]].
