Doom curse was a divine alteration spell from the necromantic sphere that cursed a target touched by the caster.
In addition to touching the target with their hand, the caster could also touch them with thrown items or weapons to affect the curse. The doom curse lasted for several days depending on the skill of the caster. The effects varied but some examples included slowing the target, reducing their general vitality, making it impossible to speak clearly, the inability to properly hold and item, etc.
Doom curse could be lifted by either casting remove curse or by the reverse lift doom.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
This rare spell was used only by dwarves.
