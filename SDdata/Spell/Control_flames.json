        "mainbody": "Control flames, sometimes known as affect normal fires, was a spell that allowed control and manipulation of non-magical fires.\nFor the duration of up to one hour, or until dismissed, the spell allowed the caster to affect an existing flames luminosity, color, size, and even shape, or even to extinguish it completely. The spell did not affect the original flames fuel consumption (although expanding the flame into a new location required some form of fuel), nor did it affect fire elementals.\nThe spell could be used in space to extinguish an open flame before it came into contact with the phlogiston, but did not prevent the explosion if the flame was exposed to the fluid before the spell could be cast.\nThe spell required only somatic components.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Nobrow in  and was originally known as Nobrows fire effect.\nIn 1217 DR, a self-taught aspiring wizard, Princess Milianna Mannicci of Sumbria, Blade Kingdoms, was learning arcane magics from Lady Faverettis Cookery Handbook for Erudite Young Girls (with an appendix on Poisoning for Beginners). In her attempts to learn the cantrip, Milianna caused an explosion in their tower. When confronted about the raucous, she blamed it on smokepowder-eating exploding rats.\nIn 1366 DR, Zaranda Star used the spell to demonstrate her power to the villagers whom she had just talked out of burning her at the stake."
