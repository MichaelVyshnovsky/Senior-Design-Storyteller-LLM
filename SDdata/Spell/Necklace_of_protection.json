        "mainbody": "A '''''necklace of protection''''' was a [[magic item]] that offered a slight degree of protection to the wearer.",
        "Powers": "These items made the wearer slightly more difficult to strike during combat and provided a small boost to their ability to resist the effects of [[spell]]s, poison, etc. The effects of a ''necklace of protection'' did stack with similar magic items.",
        "Notable Owners": "[[Brieme]], an [[eladrin]] from the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], wore a shell ''necklace of protection''."
