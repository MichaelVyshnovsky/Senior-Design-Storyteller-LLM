This power would usually be divided over one powerful creature, two half as powerful, three less powerful, or four weaker creatures, but if used with a higher spell level then the number of creatures would double or even triple. They also considered the caster and her allies companions and followed the commands of the caster.\nThe beast or beasts would last for a hour or until they \"died\" from their wounds or otherwise.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were needed for this spell.\nThe arcane version of this spell was developed by the Netherese arcanist Lucke in , and was originally called Luckes animal conjuration.\nIt was recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki.\nIn the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast conjure animals within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm.
