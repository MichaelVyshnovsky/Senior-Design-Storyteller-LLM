        "mainbody": "'''''Evard's black tentacles''''', or simply '''''black tentacles''''', was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that conjured tentacles to grapple and restrain opponents. It was presumably developed by [[Evard]].",
        "Effect": "This spell conjured many {{SIAdj|10|ft}} rubbery black tentacles that erupted from flat surfaces and grabbed, grappled, and crushed everything in a {{SIAdj|40|ft}} diameter circular area for a brief time according to the power of the caster. In a later version, the tentacles would try to restrain anything that entered or stayed in a {{SIAdj|20|ft}} square area, and caused bludgeoning damage, for up to a minute.\n\nThe area that was covered by the tentacles would be difficult for creatures to traverse.",
        "Components": "[[Verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were required to cast this spell, as well as a piece of a tentacle from a [[giant octopus]] or [[squid]] as a [[material component]].",
        "History": "''Evard's black tentacles'' was apparently unknown to the [[Netherese]]; it was not recorded as being known to them.<ref>\n\nThe ''Evard's black tentacles'' spell was once kept in the great library of [[Candlekeep]], until it was stolen by [[Eldrus Wands]], a [[wizard]] and [[Magister]] from [[409 DR]] to [[516 DR]]. He made many copies and, in the guise of a poor and simple former adventurer, sold [[scroll]]s of it across [[Faerûn]] for mere handfuls of [[copper piece]]s.\n\nIn the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''Evard's black tentacles'' was still a rare spell in the Realms.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the [[Halruaa]]n mage [[Daltim Flamefist]] had developed a variant, ''[[Daltim's fiery tentacles]]'', simply adding blue-white flame to the black tentacles. [[Kyristan]] instead formed the tentacles of life-draining [[negative energy]], developing ''[[Kyristan's malevolent tentacles]]''.",
        "Notable Users": "The following mages knew ''Evard's black tentacles'':\n* [[Thebadol]], a [[Halruaan elder]] in 1373 DR.\n* [[Pharaun Mizzrym]], a Menzoberranyr [[drow]] [[wizard]].<ref>\n* [[Kyriani Agrivar]], a [[half-drow]] wizard of [[Waterdeep]].<ref>{{Cite comic/Suspicion!|5}}"
