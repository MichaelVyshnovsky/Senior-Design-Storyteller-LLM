Cloud of bewilderment was a spell used by bards, sorcerers and wizards.
When cast, this spell allowed the caster to exhale a cloud of rancid air. This noxious gas was invisible and any creature coming into contact with it would be temporarily blinded and stunned.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
