Witchweed was an uncommon evocation spell of the southern magic tradition.
The spell created an anti-magic cloud of smoke with a radius of 40 feet (12 meters). Any wizard within the cloud was unable to cast spells. The cloud also inflicted damage. The cloud did not move only a gust of wind spell was able to move the cloud.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, tobacco, which was burned during casting.
