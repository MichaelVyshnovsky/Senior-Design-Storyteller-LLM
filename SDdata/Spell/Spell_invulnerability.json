        "mainbody": "Spell invulnerability, also known as invulnerability to spells, was an arcane abjuration spell that rendered the recipient completely immune to one spell, spell-like ability, or magic item for a short time.\nThis spell took ten minutes to cast and worked against only one spell, spell-like ability, or magic item that was specified as part of the casting. The invulnerability lasted 18 minutes, or longer for more experienced casters. Only one spell invulnerability at a time could be active on a creature.\nWhen casting this spell, the caster had to be specific about the spell from which he or she would bestow immunity. For example, the caster had to distinguish between the arcane or divine version of the light spell. Once invulnerability was granted, that spell, item, or effect ceased to exist for the recipient for the duration of spell invulnerability. If it was the light spell just mentioned, the immune individual could not be blinded by a light being cast in front of his or her eyes, but also could not see anything illuminated solely by light. Being rendered immune to a beholders flesh to stone eye did not protect against the beholders other eyes, nor from the bite of a cockatrice, nor from a flesh to stone cast by another wizard. For magic items, being immune to all swords +1 meant exactly that&mdashthose swords would pass through the recipient as if they did not exist&mdashbut a sword +1, +4 vs. reptiles could hit the recipient normally.\nSpell scrolls were considered spells and not items for the purposes of spell invulnerability. Unique items, such as artifacts, relics, or the Baneblades of Demron for example, could not be affected by this spell. Likewise for magical creatures such as golems or creatures from other planes of existence.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.\nSpell invulnerability was considered a masterwork among abjurers and was believed to have been developed by Caddelyn in response to the transmuters spellstrike. It was first found in the unfinished Caddelyns Workbook by Dabron Sashenstar, who copied it down before the book was lost. although it was rare to find it."
