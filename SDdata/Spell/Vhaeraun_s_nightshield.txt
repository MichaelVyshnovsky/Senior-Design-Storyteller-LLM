Vhaerauns nightshield was an abjuration spell contained in the Obsul Ssussun and associated with the drow god Vhaeraun.
The spell created a protective aura that enhanced the physical resilience, reflexes, and willpower of the caster, and protected them from the magic missile spell in a manner similar to a brooch of shielding.
Vhaerauns nightshield used verbal and somatic components, and the divine version also required a divine focus like a holy symbol.
