        "mainbody": "Hurl thunderbolt was a divine evocation spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Gilgeam called Martinets.\nThis spell allowed a Martinet to hurl a lightning bolt from their upraised holy symbol toward a single target. In addition to electrifying the target, the bolt unleashed a clap of thunder upon striking the target, temporarily deafening anyone within  of the target.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the Martinets holy symbol to cast."
