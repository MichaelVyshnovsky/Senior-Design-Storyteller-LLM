Fatigue was an enchantment spell that induced exhaustion and weariness within any person or creature that passed through an affected area.
Upon casting this spell, a magical zone extended outward from the caster in the shape of a 60 (18.3) long cone, with a 30 (9.1 m) wide base. Any being caught within the area immediately succumbed to intense fatigue. Their movement became sluggish, their reflexes were hampered and their spirit and determination were drained from their being.
The duration of this spell lasted for a matter of seconds, but increased depending on the skill and experience of the caster.
This spell was unique to the elves of Evermeet. The specifications of its casting were a well-kept secret of island realm.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the material component of a small stone.
