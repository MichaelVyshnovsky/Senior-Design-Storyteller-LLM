'''''Create chosen one''''' was a cruel ''[[alteration]]'' spell that consisted of numerous rituals of torture infected upon a willing or unwilling [[human]]. This spell was only used by [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], and they never shared it with outsiders.

==Components==
The spell required a bound, restrained, and helpless human to be subjected to an hour-long series of ritualistic torture sessions. Apart from the prolonged agony of the target, the spell had somatic and vocal components.

This ritual spell was available to [[evil]]-aligned [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
Once the ritual of torture was complete and the last syllables of the spell were spoken, the victim was engulfed in the ''[[death magic]]'' energies that twisted, disfigured, and mutated the target into a gangly vicious creature known as [[chosen one]] under full control of its master creator. Nothing short of a ''[[wish]]'' spell could reverse this transformation.
