Burning blade is among the most complex spells learned by swordmage initiates and is used most commonly by those who invoke the assault style of arcane swordplay. When a swordmage casts burning blade he or she transmutes their swords surface into flames, making it more deadly upon contact with the flesh of a swordmages foe. The initial power of the spell is largely determined by a swordmages intellect but the effect of the spell can continue for up to several minutes, during which time the intensity of the flames is dependent instead upon the swordmages physical strength. Burning blade is fairly difficult to cast and, as such, can only be used once per day.
