        "mainbody": "Ghost knight was a multi-school divine spell that allowed a cleric to conjure forth a number of armor-clad specters.\nWhen this spell was cast, one or more ghost knights appeared within eyesight of the caster. They appeared as spectral figures clad in masked suits of plate mail armor.  \nThe ghost knights were nearly entirely incorporeal. They floated above the ground and were capable of walking upon the air. They could only manipulate a single object, but could not wield a weapon in combat. Similarly, could mimic the somatic components of spellcasting but were incapable of wielding magic. Illusory attacks made by the ghost knights caused a temporary chill feeling but were not actually harmful.\nThe number of ghost knights that could be conjured depended on the skill and experience of the caster.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component of a single piece of armor that was present at a combat within which at least one individual died.\nThis spell was inscribed within the Kelemvorite relic the Testament of Vraer."
