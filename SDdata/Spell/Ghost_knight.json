        "mainbody": "'''''Ghost knight''''' was a multi-[[school of magic|school]] [[divine]] spell that allowed a [[cleric]] to conjure forth a number of armor-clad specters.",
        "Effects": "When this spell was cast, one or more ''ghost knights'' appeared within eyesight of the caster. They appeared as spectral figures clad in masked suits of [[plate mail]] armor.  \n\nThe ''ghost knights'' were nearly entirely incorporeal. They floated above the ground and were capable of walking upon the air. They could only manipulate a single object, but could not wield a weapon in combat. Similarly, could mimic the [[somatic component]]s of spellcasting but were incapable of wielding [[magic]]. Illusory attacks made by the ''ghost knights'' caused a temporary chill feeling but were not actually harmful.\n\nThe number of ''ghost knights'' that could be conjured depended on the skill and experience of the caster.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]] of a single piece of armor that was present at a combat within which at least one individual died.",
        "History": "This spell was inscribed within the [[Kelemvor]]ite [[relic]] the ''[[Testament of Vraer]]''."
