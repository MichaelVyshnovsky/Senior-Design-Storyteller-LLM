        "mainbody": "'''''Arcane mark ward''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell used by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] to protect their enclaves from intrusion without their knowledge.",
        "Effects": "This spell took ten minutes to cast and lasted a few days to many days, depending on the level of the caster. The spell covered a sphere with a radius of {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} centered on a point. The effect of the spell was very similar to the ''[[alarm]]'' spell, except the trigger was a person or object that had previously been tagged with the caster's ''[[arcane mark]]''. When such a person or object crossed the perimeter of the sphere in either direction, the caster was alerted by a mental touch that was noticeable without breaking concentration. If the caster was in a natural sleep state, he or she was awakened. The caster had to be within {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} of the ''ward'' in order to receive the alarm.\n\nObjects and creatures that were traveling in the [[Ethereal plane|Ethereal]] or [[Astral Plane|Astral]] planes did not trip the ward unless they phased into the [[Prime Material plane|Material]] plane while inside the warded volume.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required the same arcane focus as the ''alarm'' spell: a very thin [[silver]] [[wire]] and a tiny [[bell]]."
