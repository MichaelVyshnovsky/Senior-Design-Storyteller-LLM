        "mainbody": "'''''Chaos''''', originally called '''''Berthot's disorder''''', was a common [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that caused several targets to become severely disorientated.",
        "Effects": "The spell caused several creatures in a large volume, up to 40 ft (12.2 m) in every dimension, to be subject to chaotic effects. Those who were unable to resist would either wander far away, become confused, or even attack the creature closest to them. The duration of the spell, as well as its range, scaled with the power of the caster. Any confused creature that was attacked (either a confused ally, or a foe) would see their attacker as a foe. Thus, as the spell affected multiple creatures, there was a chance that those creatures would end up attacking each other.\n\n''Chaos'' was similar to another spell, ''[[confusion]]'', but only more experienced [[mage]]s could cast ''chaos''. Unlike ''confusion'', only [[fighters]] and [[enchanter]]s, as well as unintelligent, non-[[magic]]al creatures, had a chance to resist the spell's effect. Some powerful and very intelligent creatures also had a chance to resist ''chaos''.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component|material]] components. The two material components were a disc of [[bronze]] and a small [[iron]] rod.",
        "History": "The spell was invented by the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]], [[Berthot]], in {{Yearlink|-1105}}."
