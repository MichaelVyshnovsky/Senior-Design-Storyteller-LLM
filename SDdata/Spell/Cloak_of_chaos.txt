Cloak of chaos was a divine abjuration spell that granted magical armor and resistance, especially against lawful creatures and magic.
The affected beings—up to fifteen or more within  of the caster—were surrounded by random patterns of colors that warded them from harm. These had four distinct benefits. First, those warded were shielded from attacks and bestowed resistance to harmful effects. They were also immune to possession and mental influence. Both applied whether the source was lawful or not.
They were also warded against spells of a lawful nature and spells cast by lawful beings. In addition, if a lawful attacker successfully struck someone warded by cloak of chaos, the attacker risked being confused for several seconds, similar to the confusion spell.
As well as verbal and somatic components, the spell required a focus in the form of a tiny reliquary worth over 500 gp holding a sacred relic associated with chaos, like a piece of parchment of a chaotic text.
