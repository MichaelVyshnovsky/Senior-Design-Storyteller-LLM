        "mainbody": "Delayed light was a spell that was commonly used by alhoons.\nWhen cast, the spell created a glowing light with the same luminescence as torchlight. The spell required triggering conditions, similar to magic mouth. When the conditions were met, the light appeared. This was a long-term spell it would still activate if conditions were met years after the spell was originally cast. The light was able to remove magical darkness.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components a phosphorescent material and a spark from a fire or flint."
