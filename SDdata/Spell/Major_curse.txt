Major curse was a southern magic divine spell available to worshipers of Nephthys.
This spell was identical to the remove curse spell. The key difference was this spell had a permanent effect. The spell could be cast on a creature or an item. If a cursed item was touched, the unfortunate individual became cursed.
The reverse of this spell, remove major curse, removed the effects of both this spell as well as the bestow curse spell.
This spell required only somatic and verbal components.
