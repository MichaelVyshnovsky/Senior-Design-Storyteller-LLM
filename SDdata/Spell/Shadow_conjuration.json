        "mainbody": "Shadow conjuration, also known as shadow monsters, was an illusion spell that created semi-real duplicates of lesser conjuration spells.\nThe spell drew energy from the Plane of Shadow in order to create a semi-real duplicate of any conjuration spell of lesser power from the subschools of summoning or creation.\nIf the victim recognized the illusion, the shadow energy was a lot less effective than the duplicated spell. It was always less effective on objects as objects couldnt believe in the first place.\nThe spell also had a greater version that allowed the duplication of stronger spells and was more powerful, even when seen through as an illusion. An even stronger version of the spell was the shades spell.\nShadow conjuration used verbal and somatic components only.\nOn the Malatran Plateau, both arcane and divine magics were harnessed using spell fetishes. Shadow conjuration arcane spell fetish  was a shard of a smoky crystal that protected strange shifting shadows when light shone through.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Shadow in  and was originally called Shadows monster."
