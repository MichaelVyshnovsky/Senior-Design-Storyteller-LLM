        "mainbody": "Laerals cutting hand was a spell used by sorcerers and wizards.\nWhen cast, this spell modified the structure of the casters hand so it acted like a bladed weapon. It caused the same damage as a regular bladed weapon. Although the caster was unable to use this hand for casting spells that used a somatic component, they were able to use it normally otherwise.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
