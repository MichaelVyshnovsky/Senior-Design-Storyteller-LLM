        "mainbody": "Entomb was a spell used commonly in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by wizards.\nWith this spell the caster trapped creatures within a 30 foot cube of stone raised from the earth. In order for the spell to succeed, the cube needed to be raised from natural earth, passing through any vegetation that was in the area. Any creature caught by this spell was trapped unless they possessed some ability to pass through stone.\nEntomb was a popular spell used among dao slavers.\nThis spell required a small cube of stone scored with lines on each side, as well as verbal components, to cast."
