'''''Thunder step''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that teleported the caster over a short distance, leaving behind a deafening shockwave of sonic energy.

==Effects==
Upon casting the spell, the caster could teleport to a visible location within a distance of {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}}. It was possible to take objects or a nearby willing creature along, provided the creature was willing and that there was enough room at the destination.

As soon as the caster disappeared from the original location, a loud sonic boom detonated in the area, injuring anyone within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the origin. The boom could be heard from as far as {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}} away.

==Components==
The spell required only a [[verbal component]].
