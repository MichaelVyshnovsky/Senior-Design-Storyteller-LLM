Mind bond was a divine divination spell that allowed a paladin and their mount to communicate telepathically and coordinate their attacks.
For a brief period, the paladin enhanced the mental bond they had with their mount, letting them predict each others movements. This had an advantage in battle the odds of hitting an opponent flanked by mount and paladin were boosted by double the normal amount. Furthermore, the mount was more likely to hit targets while it was in the close range of the spell.
The spell required verbal and somatic components, as well as their divine focus.
