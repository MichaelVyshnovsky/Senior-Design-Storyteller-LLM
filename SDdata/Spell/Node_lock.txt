Node lock was an abjuration spell that limited access to an node and rendered it undetectable by magical means.
Formerly believed to affect only earth nodes, upon casting this spell, a spellcaster made it increasingly difficult for others to tap into the power of any node. In addition, it rendered the node immune to the effects of the spell locate node.
This spell was only available to those who were capable of tapping into node magic. Its effects however, could be readily dispelled by any spellcaster.
