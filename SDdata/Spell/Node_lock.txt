'''''Node lock''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that limited access to an ''[[node magic|node]]'' and rendered it undetectable by [[magic]]al means.

==Effects==
Formerly believed to affect only ''[[earth node]]s'', upon casting this spell, a [[spellcaster]] made it increasingly difficult for others to tap into the power of any ''node''. In addition, it rendered the node immune to the effects of the spell ''[[locate node]]''.

This spell was only available to those who were capable of tapping into ''node magic''. Its effects however, could be readily ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' by any spellcaster.
