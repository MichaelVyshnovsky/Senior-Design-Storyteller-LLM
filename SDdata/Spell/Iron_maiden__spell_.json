The helmed horror that appeared was actually a [[battle horror]] wielding a [[longsword]] and a [[mace]]. The caster could provide instructions to the helmed horror with their thoughts, allowing the caster to work other [[magic]] at the same time.\n\nThe helmed horror would shatter into dust and rust if destroyed or when the spell expired. The caster needed to wait a full day to recover before memorizing the spell again.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a piece of metal plate from armor that had been worn in battle to cast."
