        "mainbody": "Iron maiden was a wizard spell used to summon aid.\nThis spell conjured a loyal and powerful helmed horror to obey the casters every command. The helmed horror that appeared was actually a battle horror wielding a longsword and a mace. The caster could provide instructions to the helmed horror with their thoughts, allowing the caster to work other magic at the same time.\nThe helmed horror would shatter into dust and rust if destroyed or when the spell expired. The caster needed to wait a full day to recover before memorizing the spell again.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a piece of metal plate from armor that had been worn in battle to cast."
