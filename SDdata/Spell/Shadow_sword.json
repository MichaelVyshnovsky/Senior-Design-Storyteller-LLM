        "mainbody": "'''''Shadow sword''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[illusion]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Shaundakul]], enabling them to create and wield a [[sword]] made from shadow.",
        "Effects": "This spell created a ''shadow sword'' that was physically wielded by the caster. The shape and size of the sword could resemble any sword type the caster was familiar with. The ''shadow sword'' made it easier to strike and harm targets. These bonuses were doubled when facing [[ogre]]s, [[troll]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, [[giant]]s, and giantkin. The ''shadow sword'' was most effective when used against [[undead]]. The spell would end if the caster released the ''shadow sword'', or when the sword entered an area of complete darkness. The sword would vanish if a ''[[light]]'' or ''[[continual light]]'' spell were cast upon it.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the caster's [[holy symbol]] and a [[gauntlet]] to cast."
