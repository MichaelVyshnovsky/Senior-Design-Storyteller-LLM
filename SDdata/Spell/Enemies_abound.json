        "mainbody": "Enemies abound was a spell that confused an enemy. \nWhen cast, this spell caused a target creature to become confused and frightened, and subsequently unable to distinguish friend or foe. The creature randomly attacked anyone nearby. A strong-enough creature or a creature with a natural immunity to fear was unaffected by this spell. \nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
