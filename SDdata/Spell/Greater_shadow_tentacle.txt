Greater shadow tentacle was an arcane abjuration spell that summoned a giant, rope-like tentacle made of existing shadows that fell upon an area.
The spell animated shadows from an existing anchor point and extend outward, up to 100 (30.5Â m) and ensnare a target. The shadows would hold a creature down, preventing it from moving away or, if so desired, slowing it considerably. The affected creature could free itself from the shadows hold with some considerable effort.
The shadow tentacles were not affected by natural or magical light.
Greater shadow tentacles required only somatic components.
The Sharran monkish Order of the Dark Moon often used this spell. In fact, when these sorcerers arcane capabilities grew to levels that they could handle the spell, it was taught to them. It did not deplete the sorcerers ability to cast additional spells for it was a gift from Shar.
