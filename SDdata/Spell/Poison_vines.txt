'''''Poison vines''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s.

==Effects==
This spell was identical to ''[[vine mine]]'', except it created poisonous vines. They grew rapidly and the caster was able to direct them. During casting, the druid was able to choose a specific effect the vines would have on either the caster or an opponent. The caster could use the vines as an aid in climbing, to bind or hamper an opponent, to ''[[camouflage]]'' so they blended in with the background or to cause the vines to have the same effect as ''[[entangle]]''. The caster was immune to the poisonous vines.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a crown made from ivy leaves.
