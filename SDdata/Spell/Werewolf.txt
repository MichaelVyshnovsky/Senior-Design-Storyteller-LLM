Werewolves are a type of shape-changing monster in Faerûn that are vulnerable to silver or magic weapons and can regenerate most wounds. Infected werewolves transform during the full moon involuntarily. Members of their race that are born with the curse can infect others and can control their shifting. Selûne has a group of non-evil werewolves that worship her, though most lycanthropes are drawn towards the worship of Malar.
Werewolves are the most common type of lycanthropes in the world. They are found in all climates, both in the wild and hidden in civilization. Werewolf packs are organized similar to wolf packs, with a powerful alpha in command of the entire group. The moral and ethical outlook of the pack tends to follow that of the alpha.
