Bards practiced magic as they would art or song, using their artistic talents to induce magical effects that either bolstered their allies or hindered their enemies, typically through [[charm|charms]] and [[illusion|illusions]]. In addition to their magical skills, bards were artistically talented and extraordinarily well-learned, possessing knowledge in a wide range of fields.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 5th edition|51}} Bards were among the most versatile of [[adventurer]]s, capable of learning from practically any trade.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|66-67}}\n{{quote|I've been a bard long enough to know the three main rules of the entertainer. Don't turn your back on your audience. Don't upstage the act that follows. Always leave the audience wanting more.|[[Joel]] the Rebel Bard}}",
        "Culture": "{{quote|''Stupid bards. Half the crowd always loves their songs, and the other half hates them. No better way to start a fight than to let a musician sing.''|[[Xaphira Matrell]] of [[Arrabar]]}}\n\nBoth literally and figuratively enchanting, bards drew upon, more than perhaps any other profession, the works of all who'd come before them. Storytellers, musicians, enchanters, dancers, and lorekeepers, bards were prone to wanderlust, traveling from one place to another in search of new lore or perhaps in the hopes of spreading what they already knew.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 5th edition|51-52}} Some came into the services of others as ambassadors or spies, but most bards preferred the freedom of mobility and living by one's whims, though this was not without exception{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|67}} and most bards acquired their skills as a result of training under previous bards, drawing upon ancient traditions of lore and arcane magic.\n\nBards had a reputation for being joyful and inspiring, though as with every skill their ability to charm and inspire had a darker side. Evil bards were manipulative and cunning, twisting the hearts of others either through magic or sheer charisma. Most bards, though, regardless of their individual morals, held a strong distaste for blatant violence, at least when it could be avoided. To a bard the joys of life were in seeking knowledge or, better yet, witnessing the discovery of such knowledge firsthand. For this reason many bards were drawn to the adventuring lifestyle, hoping to witness the weaving of new tales firsthand - or perhaps even to instigate them.\n\nBards were common throughout [[Toril]], appearing most commonly in the [[Dalelands]] and [[North Faerûn]], though they could also be found in large numbers in as diverse locations as [[Chult]] or [[Vaasa]]. Some of the world's greatest magical and adventuring traditions were propped up and supported by bards. The most notable of these, the [[Harper]]s, held a large numbers of bards within their ranks.\n\n[[File:Neverwinter bard.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''A valiant bard who just emerged victorious in a brawl.'']]\nThe most common bards were [[human]]s and [[elves]], as well as [[half-elves]] to a lesser extent, the latter two drawing upon the ancient magical and musical traditions of the elves to their benefit. On the other hand, few [[half-orc]]s, [[orc]]s, or [[goblinoid]]s became bards, their ancient traditions less befitting the bard's lifestyle. Nor, for that matter, were [[dwarf|dwarven]], except for [[gold dwarf|gold dwarves]], though [[halfling]] and [[gnome|gnomish]] bards were. Of all the races, half-elves, with their unusual combination of endurance and charm, were considered to have the best natural capability for a bard's lifestyle, though gnomes and [[tiefling]]s also made excellent bards.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|67}}\n\nBards typically got along well with non-bards, in no small part due to their versatility and charm. In parties of adventurers most bards served as spokesmen of sorts, due to their affinity for social interaction and skill at [[enchantment]]. Bards clashed with few people, having a little bit of something to offer just about anyone.\n\nBards were drawn most often to the worship of [[god]]s of magic, such as [[Corellon]], [[Selûne]], or others. Good bards sometimes worshiped [[Bahamut]] or [[Moradin]]. Less moralistic bards were instead sometimes drawn to the worship of [[Lolth]], [[Tiamat]], or [[Zehir]].{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|67}}",

Do ye want to try such things?|source=[[Zanshareen Sabiyryn]], ''A Sage's Travel Guide to The North''{{Cite dragon/272/The New Adventures of Volo: Quotations of the Realms|96}}}}\nBards were among the most versatile of adventurers. While not necessarily as tough as a [[fighter]], as skilled as a [[rogue]], or as intelligent as a [[wizard]], bards were widely capable in a number of different situations and were widely recognized as a sort of \"jack-of-all-trades.\"{{cite book/Player's Handbook 5th edition|54}} For instance, bards were better trained in weaponry than all other arcane spellcasters (including [[swordmage]]s) trained in the use of all simple weapons, [[longsword]]s, [[rapier]]s, [[shortsword]]s, and hand crossbows.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 5th edition|52}} Additionally, some bards exhibited proficiency in [[scimitar]]s and martial ranged weapons as well.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|66}} Similarly, bards were naturally knowledgeable and had an uncanny ability for improvisation and trying new things. But unlike fighters or rogues, who might be similarly proficient, bards were capable of casting [[ritual]]s and [[spell]]s, including those normally only used by other spellcasters.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 5th edition|53-54}}\n\nBards of all kinds learned to inspire virtue and ability in those around them. Exactly how frequently a bard could do this depended partially upon their strength of personality as well as their level of experience.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|67-68}} In addition to this, experienced bards could also counteract the effects of spells designed to charm or frighten, providing magical aid to their allies. Similarly, bards, through their music and arts, could soothe the nerves of their allies and, through their magic, heal their wounds and bolster their spirits, either at rest or in combat.\n\nBards were, as a general rule, uncannily skilled advocates and diplomats. For many bards this was a result of their typically high charisma but some bards - including those who were less charming - could boost their persuasive power through magic. They did this by actually enchanting the very words they speak, making them sound even more persuasive and compelling than they would normally.\n\nLike other spellcasters, bards usually used implements to increase the effectiveness of their spells{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|67}} or to subsitute for their material cost.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 5th edition|203}} Some bards used [[wand]]s for this purpose, wielding them like a conductor's baton. Others use more specialized implements such as [[songblade]]s. Most however used a [[musical instrument]], enchanted or mundane, focusing their magic through music. Many bards particularly treasured this latter method and believed their music tapped into the [[Words of Creation]] themselves, sprinkling song and story with echoes of the universe's beginnings.",
        "Bard Colleges": {
            "College of Glamour": "{{Main|College of Glamour}}\nSome bards preferred to hone their craft not by the masters singers and storytellers of Faerûn, but rather studied at the feet (or hooves) of [[fey]] beings. They learned how to bewitch and entrance others with the magic of the [[Feywild]]. They were often viewed with an interesting combination of wonder and some fright by the common folk, but their performances were considered among the most magnificent. The eloquence with which they shared stories or performed recitations was legendary in its ability to win over allies and influence the minds of even the most formidable beings of the Realms.\n\nBards of the College of Glamour performed songs whose lyrics and melodies were imbued with fey magic. They could be used to take on wondrous appearances, that inspired their allies to perform great feats in battle, or seduce listeners with otherworldly allure. The most experienced of bards could appear as majestic ferocious as the fey themselves, influencing the minds of bystanders and turning enemies away from their glory.",
            "College of Lore": "{{Main|College of Lore}}\nGiven all bards' love of learning it is little surprise that some bards prioritized it during their training. Bards belong to the College of Lore, also known as cunning bards, be it academic writings or folk tales, gathering in universities and local festivals alike in their pursuit of lore. Bards of this tradition weaved what tales and trivia they found into their stories and songs to entertain, as well as to illuminate that which they hold to be important. Uncompromising in their views, College of Lore bards' first loyalty was to the truth, which made them valuable (if occasionally brazen) advisers.\n\nCunning bards preferred a path of trickery and cunning, using charm and intellect together to overcome obstacles. As a result, while cunning bards were as charming as most other bards, they placed less of an emphasis on vitality and more of one on intellectual pursuits.\n\nIn addition to their peerless skill, bards from the College of Lore were also versatile spellcasters, capable of learning or imitating even more spells than a typical bard. Many cunning bards preferred using wands as implements to cast ranged spells and nearly all had training as tacticians, coordinating their allies in the midst of a battle.",
            "College of Swords": "{{Main|Blade (class)}}\nCollege of Swords bards, also known as [[blade (class)|blades]], were skilled combatants that embodied flamboyant grace and deadliness in all of their performances. They often held dual-lives, working as public entertainers while simultaneously (or later in life) serving as hired killers or mercenaries. Their skill with bladed weapons were unequaled in either respect.\n\nBards from the College of Swords performed certain moves, referred to as 'spins' or 'flourishes' in combat. These daring and risky actions allowed them to better deflect incoming attacks, inflicted more lethal damage, gain tactical advantage against their foes, or incite terror in their hearts. They preferred to wear only minimal armor, and only wielded one-handed bladed weapons, such as [[scimitar]]s.",
            "College of Valor": "[[File:Valor Singer AFR.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A [[tiefling]] bard singing a song of valor.'']]\n{{main|Skald}}\nCollege of Valor bards, also known as [[skald]]s, or valorous bards, were daring adventurers, who preferred to emulate the heroes they heard and learned of than to merely sing of them. Frequently found in mead halls or other gatherings of warriors, skalds hoped to witness heroic deeds firsthand so they may inspire future generations to similar heights. Believing that the heart should come before the mind, valorous bards were often great leaders, inspiring others to acts of heroism as legends inspired them.\n\nProficient in a greater number of weapons and armor than typical bards, bards from the College of Valor were also exceptionally skilled as warriors, capable of attacking more frequently and casting spells at the same time.",
            "College of Whispers": "{{Main|College of Whispers}}\nMembers of the College of Whispers served as spies and information brokers in the places of great importance across the Realms. They eschewed the fame and public adoration sought by many other bards, preferring secretive lives that were spent assuming the identities of others. Not many bards of strong moral standing joined the College of Whispers. Fortunately they were not the right individuals required to develop the skills needed to thrive and even survive the lifestyle of this bardic college. They mastered subtlety, self-discipline, and temperance when influencing the powers-at-be.\n\nThese bards developed skills to assume the identities of anyone whose deaths they had witnessed. If forced out into the open and into a fight, they could strike at minds of their opponents just as their blade pierced their flesh. The most experienced of their ranks could even gain some control over someone's mind at the mere utterance of an otherwise mundane phrase."

Hrmmph – I'm a bard, and I'm not a Harper.''|[[Adamar Session]]}}\n\nIn addition to the loose associations of bard colleges, which ensured that knowledge passed on from master to apprentice, bards of the [[Realms]] built organized learning institutions for masters to teach students on the bardic arts. These institutions were called [[bardic college]]s and were present during a number of periods in different places of [[Faerûn]].\n\nThe oldest known bardic colleges were the seven elder colleges of [[Fochlucan]], [[Mac-Fuirmidh]],\n[[Doss]], [[Canaith]], [[Cli]], [[Anstruth]], and [[New Olamn|Ollamh]], believed to be founded by the legendary bard [[Falataer]] from the [[Moonshae Isles]] originally as a single college divided in seven levels of skill. The seven [[Instruments of the Bards]] were named after each of these ancient colleges.\n\nBy the 1480s [[DR]], only two of the elder colleges were still active: the college of [[Fochlucan]] in [[Silverymoon]], which was revived by the bard [[Forell Luekuan]] with help from the [[Harpers]], and the college of [[New Olamn]] in [[Waterdeep]], established in [[1366 DR]] after the old college of Ollamh. Bards across the Realms dreamed of restoring the other ancient colleges as well.\n\nOther known bardic colleges included the [[College of the Herald]] within [[Herald's Holdfast]] and the [[Academia Vilhonus]] in [[Turmish]], among others."
