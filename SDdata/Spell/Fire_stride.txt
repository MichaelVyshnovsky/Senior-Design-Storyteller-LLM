Fire stride was a transmutation spell that allowed the caster to teleport around.
As mentioned above, fire stride allowed the caster to teleport around. The frequency depended on the casters strength and, whether the uses were expended or not, they expired ten minutes after casting.
The teleportation itself worked similar to the dimension door spell. The limitation was that it only allowed teleportation from one source of fire to another source of fire. The spell conferred the ability to sense the location of all viable fires. Fires that were not "viable" were those that were in a location that was not big enough to hold the caster and extreme sources of heat like a magma field. Living fires like fire elementals also did not register as viable fires for the spell.
This spell did not do two things. First, it gave the caster no protection against fire. Entering a fire and coming out of one both risked the caster getting burned, which was why potential casters were seriously advised to give themselves some protection against fire before using this spell. The second thing this spell did not do was to give any forewarning whether the place the caster teleported into supported the caster. For example, it was entirely possible that a caster fell into a cauldron full of burning oil, because he or she chose it as the destination without knowing that the fire was not on a stable surface.
Fires stride required only somatic and verbal components.
By 1374 DR, the church of Kossuth succeeded at converting fire stride into a spell of divine magic. Clerics who were initiated in Kossuths faiths secrets were capable of casting it.
