Trait removal was an arcane, transmutation spell that removed one supernatural or exceptional ability, of the casters choosing, from a specified creature.
The spell would last for at least nine hours, but could not effect constructs, oozes or the undead.
Trait removal took one hour to cast and its material component was a pinch of ash.
