        "mainbody": "Draindoom was a spell that was first developed by the phaerimms.\nThis incredibly powerful spell was a more deadly version of the lifedrain spell. The spell constantly recast itself, creating large spheres that randomly targeted anyone within the area of effect, which could be as large as  wide. The spell destroyed any liquid water within , and water couldnt pass though the spheres. It drains all magic in the area of effect, and this spell was responsible for the areas within Myth Drannor and Anauroch that were essentially dead zones for magic, where spells could not be cast. The only way to end the spell before it expired was by casting a limited wish spell or killing the caster. The caster was able to cast this spell so it was permanent, but the casting process drained some of their life force in the process. If the caster was killed while casting this spell permanently, the spell remained in effect for a full year.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components a piece of a bone from any creature and a fire of any sort. During casting, the caster placed the bone within the flame.\nThis spell was originally created by the phaerimms of Myth Drannor."
