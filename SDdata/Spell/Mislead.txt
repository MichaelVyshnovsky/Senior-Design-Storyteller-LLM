'''''Mislead''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that turned the caster invisible and created an illusory double.

==Effect==
{{Sectstub}}

The illusory double created by this spell was not only a duplicate of its caster in terms of looks, but in terms of how they felt, how they smelled, and how they sounded.{{Cite dragon/245/Sage Advice|16}}

If the [[contact]] [[psionic]] power was attempted against a spellcaster using ''mislead'', it would fail automatically, but the psionics user would also immediately notice the deception.

==Components==
The spell required only a [[somatic component]] to be cast.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Enollar]] in {{Yearlink|-1563}} and was originally called '''''Enollar's mislead'''''.
