        "mainbody": "Oars to snakes was a divine magic spell that could be used offensively or defensively, turning a ships oars into large sea snakes.\nThis spell was similar to sticks to snakes except it was specifically for use on oars, and created a few very large and tough sea serpents that remained in their oarlocks for the duration of the spell. Oars to snakes affected a minimum of three oars for at least a half hour, with more experienced druids able to transform more oars for a longer period of time.\nMost often cast defensively, a ships oars could be used to attack boarders. Each snake could engage one enemy at a time and fought with a devastating, poisonous bite. Casting oars to snakes offensively, it had a range of 150 ft (46 m) and the snakes were oriented with their heads inside the ship to attack the rowers.\nWhile the oars were in snake form, they were useless for propelling a ship. If any snake was killed in combat, it reverted to a broken and unusable oar when the spell ended. Otherwise, the oars were restored to their original condition.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small piece of wood and some scales from a sea snake as material components.\nThis spell was associated with the pirates that roamed the Sea of Fallen Stars and was a particular favorite of druids of Umberlee."
