The spell revealed the locations of all golems in the immediate vicinity, even those hidden my magical or mundane means, allowing the caster to select their target.\n\nIn addition to stopping the golem's body, the spell also instantly halted any special attacks made by the golem, including freezing their breath weapon in mid-air.\n\nThe only way to end this spell was by slaying the caster. The caster could not even choose to end the spell prematurely before it expired.",
