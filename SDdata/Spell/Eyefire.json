        "mainbody": "'''''Eyefire''''' was a very rare spell used by [[wizard]]s in the [[Moonsea]] region.",
        "Effects": "The spell caused the wizard's eyes to emit a brilliant emerald green light. The sight of this inflicted terror in creatures around the caster, causing them to take flight. Through this spell, the wizard was able to cast bolts of energy from their eyes to a target within 20 yards (18 meters). The target had to be within the field of vision of the caster. In addition to causing great damage to a target, the spell also burned away any magical item that was not warded against magical flame.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components."
