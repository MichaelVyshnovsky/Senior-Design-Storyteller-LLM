}}'''''Lifesurge''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was primarily used by [[ghul lord]]s.

==Effects==
Ghul lords could only cast this spell on a willing target, creating a negative energy field within the target that resulted in an increase of physical capabilities. The target gained more durability, mental acuity, and could even read spell scrolls that were previously beyond their comprehension.

The target would be harmed by the negative energy leaving their body when the spell expired.

==Components==
This spell did not require physical components to cast.
