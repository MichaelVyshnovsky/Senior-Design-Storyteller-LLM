        "mainbody": "Dawnshroud was a spell used by clerics of Lathander.\nThis spell was similar to the daylight spell. When cast, a targeted creature began glowing with the rose light of a new dawn. The light emitted by the spells was harmful to oozes and the undead. Any creature within  could be affected by the light from the spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a divine focus.\nWhile dawnshroud was developed by clerics of Lathander, the spell was made avaible to be used by those outside the clergy."
