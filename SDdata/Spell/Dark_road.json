        "mainbody": "Dark road was a spell used by clerics of Shar.\nDark road had two separate effects, which were chosen by the caster at the time of casting. The first use aided the caster, while underground or in darkness, in finding a direction to an object. The desired object was chosen by the caster during casting and had to have been physically handled by them beforehand of which they had distinct and intimate knowledge. The caster could use this spell multiple times to track the object if it was in motion. The spell was able to track the object even if very distant from the caster, and even areas of natural or magical radiation had no effect on the spell. If the spell was cast against a wall, such as the wall of a cavern, then the spell acted in a manner similar to passwall.\nThe second use could create a temporary opening in solid material, such as stone, earth, sand, and even metal. The dimensions of the tunnel were  in height,  in width, and  in length. The caster could gently curve the tunnel, up to  in gradient per foot of length. The caster could cast multiple instances of dark road to increase the length of the tunnel. If the tunnel closed while a creature or object was within it, they were expelled with no harm. The tunnel was unaffected by dispel magic but was vulnerable to limited wish.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components. For the first use of this spell, the material component was a straight length of bone that had come into physical contact with the object to be tracked. For the second use, the material component was a preserved eye of a creature that burrowed or phased.\nDark road was one of the spells found in Gorothirs Girdle, a holy text of the church of Shar."
