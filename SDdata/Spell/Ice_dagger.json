        "mainbody": "'''''Ice dagger''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spellcasters in the [[Realms]].",
        "Effects": "The spellcaster would shape a dagger-shaped shard of ice, which would then launch itself unerringly at a target within close range and explode upon impact, causing cold injuries to the target and others in an area within a 5-foot (1.5-meter) radius, if they could not evade.",
        "Components": "This spell required both [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, in addition to a [[material component]] in the form of a few drops of water that must have originated from melted ice."
