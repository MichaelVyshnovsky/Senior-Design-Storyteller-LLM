        "Effects": "The caster had to have memorized all three spells and not have cast either ''invisibility'' or ''levitate'' before casting ''Jonstal's double wizardry'' (unless the wizard had those spells memorized more than once).\n\nOnce activated, both ''invisibility'' and ''levitate'' took effect immediately on either the caster or a touched recipient.",
        "Components": "''Jonstal's double wizardry'' itself had only a verbal component, but the material components for both ''invisibility'' and ''levitate'' were used as well.",
        "History": "This spell was invented by the [[archmage]], [[Jonstal]]. Despite much research, Jonstal was only ever able to pair these two spells and two other spells. The other two spells were cast using ''[[Jonstal's improved double wizardry]]''. To his credit, the only other being known to be able to cast two spells at once was [[Azuth]] himself.\n\nDuring one of their many spell-sharing sessions, [[Elminster]] shared this spell with the wizards [[Mordenkainen]] of [[Oerth]] and [[Dalamar]] of [[Krynn]].{{Cite dragon/211/The Wizards Three: A Night of Shadows|84}}",
