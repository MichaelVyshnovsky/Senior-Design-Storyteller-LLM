Catfall was a psionic power of the psychoportation discipline that let the user land with ease after a fall.
Much like a cat, the manifester could leap gracefully and always land on their feet. If they fell from a heigh, they could react immediately and absorb the impact of the landing, reducing any injury they might take from the fall, even taking none at all if the distance wasnt too great or more psionic energy was spent.
Catfall could be manifested with a moments thought, so it could be used as a reaction in the event of a sudden fall. Alternatively, it could be cast beforehand, in which case it lasted for one minute or several seconds or longer for more experienced psionics-users. It affected only the manifester it could not be placed on another.
It had only the standard auditory display.
* Winestab, a thief of Waterdeep
* Teliene Coloara, an illithid slayer
* Selinah Varhast, a psychic assassin
* Catfall could be known by psionic githzerai.
