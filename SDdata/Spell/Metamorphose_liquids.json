        "mainbody": "Metamorphose liquids was an alteration spell used by wizards.\nThis spell transformed one liquid into and equal amount of any other non-magical liquid. The spell would not take effect unless the caster touched the actual liquid. It was more difficult to transform magical liquids into non-magical liquids. Magical fluids could not be transformed into different kids of magical fluids.\nThis spell could be used to harm creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Water.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a drop of the liquid that the caster intended to create to cast. The drop needed to be placed on the casters tongue and consumed.\n* Mijel Morigan, a wizard who operated Morrigans Complete Components in Ravens Bluff."
