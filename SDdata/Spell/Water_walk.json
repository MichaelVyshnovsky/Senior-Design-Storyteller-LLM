        "mainbody": "'''Water walk''' was a [[transmutation]] or [[alteration]] spell that allowed one or more creatures to stride upon liquids or semi-liquids such as water (flowing or still), [[oil]], snow, mud, or [[quicksand]].",
        "Effects": "While walking on a liquid, the subject's feet did not touch the surface but floated {{SIrange|1|2|in|long=yes}} above. Appendages made appropriate-sized oval displacements in the surface, thus leaving peculiar footprints in semi-liquids. The recipient could even walk on lava if they could stand the intense heat. If cast while submersed, the recipient would quickly float to the surface.",
        "Components": "[[Verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were required to cast this spell, as well as the priest's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]]. Older versions of this spell additionally required a piece of cork as a [[material component]]."
