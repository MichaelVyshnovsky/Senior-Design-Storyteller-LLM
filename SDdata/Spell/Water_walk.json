        "mainbody": "Water walk was a transmutation or alteration spell that allowed one or more creatures to stride upon liquids or semi-liquids such as water (flowing or still), oil, snow, mud, or quicksand.\nWhile walking on a liquid, the subjects feet did not touch the surface but floated  above. Appendages made appropriate-sized oval displacements in the surface, thus leaving peculiar footprints in semi-liquids. The recipient could even walk on lava if they could stand the intense heat. If cast while submersed, the recipient would quickly float to the surface.\nVerbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell, as well as the priests holy symbol or divine focus. Older versions of this spell additionally required a piece of cork as a material component."
