        "mainbody": "Emerald burst was an arcane evocation spell that turned an emerald into a stunning grenade-like weapon.\nAfter the caster infused the emerald with energy, it flew at foes in close range and exploded on impact. This unleashed a pulse of coruscating green light that dazed neutral beings for six seconds and stunned evil beings for up to 24 seconds, while leaving good beings unharmed.\nAs well verbal and somatic components, the spell required an emerald valued at 1,000 gp or more as a material component."
