Song of battle was an Elven High Magic wizard spell.
This ancient elven chant was used to encourage their armies during battle. Every ally within the spells range was filled with courage and bravery to the point where regular and even magical fear or other such effects were useless against them.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a harp or lute that the caster had to play to cast.
