Hold poison was an improved version of slow poison that prolonged the onset time of poison in a victim for days.
The recipient of this spell was prevented from any further harm from a poison in their system for the duration of the spell. This spell could be renewed before the expiration of the previous casting to grant more days of reprieve, but at an ever-growing chance of spell failure.
verbal and somatic components were required, plus a clove of garlic, either crushed and applied to the wound, or eaten if the poison was originally ingested.
