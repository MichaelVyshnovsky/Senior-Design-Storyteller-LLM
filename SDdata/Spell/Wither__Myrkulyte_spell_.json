        "mainbody": "Wither was a divine necromancy spell used by priests devoted to Myrkul, enabling them to duplicate the effects from a staff of withering with a touch.\nThis spell caused the casters touch to inflict a small bit of pain and age the target by ten years. The touch also had a chance to shrivel one of the victims limbs to the point where it was useless. The withered limb remained in that condition unless magically cured or regenerated, but the aging could only be reversed via a limited wish or wish. This spell had no effect on incorporeal creatures or creatures that did not age naturally.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
