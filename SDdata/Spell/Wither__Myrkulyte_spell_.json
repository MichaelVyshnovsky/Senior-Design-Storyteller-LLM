        "mainbody": "'''''Wither''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Myrkul]], enabling them to duplicate the effects from a ''[[staff of withering]]'' with a touch.",
        "Effects": "This spell caused the caster's touch to inflict a small bit of pain and age the target by ten years. The touch also had a chance to shrivel one of the victim's limbs to the point where it was useless. The withered limb remained in that condition unless magically cured or regenerated, but the aging could only be reversed via a ''[[limited wish]]'' or ''[[wish]]''. This spell had no effect on incorporeal creatures or creatures that did not age naturally.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast."
