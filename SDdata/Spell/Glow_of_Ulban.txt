Glow of Ulban is a powerful invocation bestowed upon warlocks, particularly those who specialize in pacts with aberrant powers, that flows from the power of the ancient, Far Realm-touched star of Ulban. When a glow of Ulban spell is cast, the warlock summons forth burning, blue-white light from Ulban, scorching one creature of the warlocks choosing within twenty-five feet. If the warlock specializes in such aberrant power likely also cause the creatures instincts for self-preservation to fade away, making them more vulnerable to later attacks. Glow of Ulban is not easily cast, however, and a short rest of at least a few minutes is required before a warlock can cast it again.
