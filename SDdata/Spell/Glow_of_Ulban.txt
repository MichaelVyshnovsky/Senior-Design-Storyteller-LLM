'''''Glow of Ulban''''' is a powerful [[invocation]] bestowed upon [[warlock]]s, particularly those who specialize in [[Warlock#Star Pact Warlock|pacts with aberrant powers]], that flows from the power of the ancient, [[Far Realm]]-touched star of [[Ulban]]. When a ''glow of Ulban'' spell is cast, the warlock summons forth burning, blue-white light from Ulban, scorching one creature of the warlock's choosing within twenty-five feet. If the warlock specializes in such [[aberration|aberrant]] power likely also cause the creature's instincts for self-preservation to fade away, making them more vulnerable to later attacks. ''Glow of Ulban'' is not easily cast, however, and a short rest of at least a few minutes is required before a warlock can cast it again.
