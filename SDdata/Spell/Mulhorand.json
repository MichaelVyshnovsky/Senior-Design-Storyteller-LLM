        "mainbody": "'''Mulhorand''' ({{Pronounce|muhl|HOH|rand|refs=<ref>}}) was one of the [[Old Empires]] in eastern [[Faer没n]]. The Mulhorandi were brought to [[Toril]] from [[Earth]] by the [[Imaskar|Imaskar Empire]] looking for some manpower. After countless praises, [[Ao]] contacted [[Ptah]] who led a part of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] to Toril. Ironically, their rival in the millennia to come was another human tribe captured by the [[Imaskari]] at the same time, which founded the empire of [[Unther]].\n\nMulhorand was destroyed by the [[Spellplague]] and the empire of [[High Imaskar]] came to comprise its former territories. After the [[Chosen]] of the Mulhorandi gods appeared around the time of the [[Second Sundering]], however, they and the wizard [[Nezram]] rallied the [[Mulan]] to overthrow the Imaskari once more, driving them into the [[Plains of Purple Dust]].\n\n{{TOC limit|4}}",
        "People and Culture": {
            "Society": "[[File:Pharaoh.png|thumb|300px|right|''The [[pharaoh]] of Mulhorand.'']]\nThe people of Mulhorand were arrogant individuals that considered themselves better than any rival nation. Law was paramount to the nation's citizens, and change was avoided whenever possible. The government was run by the clergies devoted to the deities of the Mulhorandi pantheon, with the church of [[Horus-Re]] being foremost in power. However, despite the peaceful existence these priests sought to create, the different priesthoods were plagued by infighting, bickering, and struggles. These conflicts occurred both within their individual orders and against those of other faiths.\n\nAfter the reformation of Mulhorand in 1487 DR, the deities of the Mulhorandi pantheon set aside their differences and focused in rebuilding the country, leading to a peaceful existence between their clergies.",
            "Customs": "As a theocratic nation, clergy of the Mulhorandi deities were treated with great respect and honor. Priests expected special treatment from the community, and held authority in all matters; public prayers were performed daily. The wealthy Mulhorandi also spent time planning and constructing personal tombs, preparing for their deaths and their continued life thereafter.",
            "Language": "Peoples native to Mulhorand spoke [[Mulhorandi language|Mulhorandi]], a language that remained largely true to the [[Rauric languages|tongue]] spoken by the [[Mulan]] peoples upon their arrival to Faer没n. In its written form, it was composed of complex pictographs used to communicate ideas and concepts."
        },
        "Economy": {
            "Slavery": "The majority of Mulhorand's people were slaves, with roughly equal numbers in the cities and five-to-one slaves to freemen in the countryside, though they only counted as seven-tenths of a person on the census. The slaves were functionally synonymous with the lower class, with free people making up the middle and upper classes. All enslaved people were owned by the land's temples, who then rented them out to customers, and they were bound by an oath to obey the gods and those that the gods placed above them. A curious aspect of this system was that Mulhorandi slaves were surprisingly haughty and considered themselves better than their foreign fellows, as they believed that they were not the property of mortal men but entrusted to the care of the gods themselves, with the temples as the intermediary.\n\nThough most slaves toiled in hardship, many received proper educations and served in the realm's bureaucracies. They were guaranteed humane treatment by law and were generally treated better than slaves in other lands; their working conditions were regularly inspected and any abuse or neglect was considered vandalism towards the temple, and killing a slave was a capital crime. The priesthood of [[Osiris]] was responsible for overseeing the welfare of all slaves, and any slave who felt that they were being mistreated was expected to call on them to dispense justice, which usually involved the forfeiture of lands and other assets. It was not uncommon for a master to directly pay their slaves as they returned to temple custody, with it seen as a form of virtuous piety.\n\nDuring the 1350s DR, the vizier [[Rezim]] proposed radical changes to Mulhorand's society. He wished to allow temples to directly sell slaves to nobles, with no oversight over their treatment, and claimed that it would improve economic efficiency. This proposal made him greatly unpopular with the [[Pharaoh]] and other people of influence due to its obvious favoring of his political backers.\n\nWhen Mulhorand conquered [[Unther]] in the 1370s DR, much of its efforts there went to controlling sudden slave revolts, and integrating the population into temple service. As the army of Mulhorand was controlled by the priests of [[Anhur]], most of the \"liberated\" slaves were seized by the temple of Anhur. Some of the most capable and enthusiastic of these slaves were sent back to Unther with training and equipment, with the mission of finding and destroying the remaining Untheric resistance."

            "Deserts": "The [[Plains of Purple Dust]] were located in eastern Mulhorand. The faintly magical sands of this area were home to [[purple worm]]s, nomads, and other hostile creatures. Connections to the [[Underdark]] were also common in this region. [[Raurin]], the Dust Desert, was a wasteland hiding numerous ruins and forgotten magic. This region was also home to [[dragon]]s and [[efreet]]i.",

            "Rivers": "The River of the Dawn was Mulhorand's northernmost river and served as a boundary between the nations of Mulhorand and [[Thay]]. The [[River of Shadows]] was named after the city of Skuld, which lay near the river's delta. The water from the [[River of Spears]] was used to irrigate the farmlands of the Great Vale. The [[River of Swords]] served as the border between the nations of Mulhorand and [[Unther]] in the years prior to the Spellplague, and, in the 15th century DR, between Mulhorand and [[Tymanther]].",
            "Cities": "Skuld was the capital of Mulhorand. Skuld was also recognized as the oldest continually inhabited city in Faer没n. [[Gheldaneth]] was a port city that housed Mulhorand's [[Arcanum of Magic|Great University]] and the [[Wizard College (Gheldaneth)|Wizard College]]. Sultim was Mulhorand's largest port, and the center of the worship of [[Anhur]]. [[Neldorild]] was relatively new (as of the 14th century DR) and was constantly growing. Its community served as a retreat for both the wealthy and retired. [[Mishtan]] was a town ruled by the church of [[Osiris]]. It served as the home of the Mulhorandi that worked to expand the nearby [[Land of the Dead]]."

            "Arrival, Slavery and Freedom": "In response to a plague that killed much of its people, the Imaskar Empire captured over one hundred thousand humans through the use of two portals opened to another world. These portals were then closed and all connections between the two worlds were sealed; the captured peoples, now called the Mulan, were enslaved by the Imaskari. \n\nThe Imaskari barrier inhibited contact between the Mulan and their deities. However, Ao intervened and allowed mortal [[avatar|manifestation]]s of these deities to bypass the barrier and enter Toril directly.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-1967}}, war broke out between Mulhorand and Unther. The conflict ended in {{Yearlink|-1961}} when the ruling deities agreed upon the River of Swords as a common border between their two nations.",

Thayd was executed shortly after for inciting rebellion, and the portal remained forgotten until discovered by the orcs. In the year {{Yearlink|-1076}}, the humanoids invaded Mulhorand and Unther, beginning what later became known as the [[Orcgate Wars]].\n\nThe invading orcs possessed the ability to summon the [[avatar]]s of their deities. The divine manifestations of the Mulhorandi and [[Untheric pantheon]]s faced those of the [[orc pantheon]] in what later became known as the [[Battle of the Gods]], a clash that resulted in the death of the Mulhorandi deity [[Re]] at the hands of [[Gruumsh]] in {{Yearlink|-1071}}. The conflict continued until the Mulhorandi and Untheric pantheons allied to defeat the invading force in {{Yearlink|-1069}}.",
            "Decline and Recovery": "In the wake of the Orcgate Wars, Mulhorand began a prolonged decline in power. Its daughter states broke free and formed the nations of Murgh么m, [[Semphar]], and [[Thay]]. This decline continued until the [[Time of Troubles]], at which time the Imaskari barrier was dissolved by Ao. The divine manifestations that had ruled for centuries rejoined their primary essences; Mulhorand was ruled by a true mortal king for the first time in its history. After a brief upheaval, the nation stabilized under the rule of the clergy.",
            "Untheric Crusade": "{{Main|Untheric Crusade}}\nIn response to the death of Unther's manifest deity [[Gilgeam|Gilgeam the Tyrant]], the [[pharaoh]], [[Horustep III]], allowed the clerics of Anhur to cross the River of Swords and invade their long time rival nation. Assisted by a mercenary company, the [[Gold Swords]], Mulhorand invaded Unther in [[1371 DR]].",
            "The Spellplague": "{{Main|Spellplague}}\nNo more than six years after the conquest of Unther, Mulhorand was destroyed by the Spellplague in [[1385 DR]]. Many of the Mulan people were killed during the alteration of the landscape and the few survivors that remained in Toril fled to other lands such as [[Chessenta]]. The Mulhorandi pantheon vanished without a trace.\n\nMulhorand soon became completely devoid of civilization, and the [[Deep Imaskari]] wizard [[Ususi Manaallin]] founded the empire of [[High Imaskar]] on its former territories, with immigrants from [[Deep Imaskar]] comprising most of its citizenry.",
