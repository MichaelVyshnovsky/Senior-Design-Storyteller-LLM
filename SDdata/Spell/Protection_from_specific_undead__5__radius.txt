'''''Protection from specific undead, 5' radius''''' was a [[spell]] used by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]]

==Effects==
This spell was compromised of several sub-spells, each spell targeting a specific type of [[undead]]. Each spell had to be memorized individually by the caster. Selected undead were unable to get within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the recipient. This protective area moved with the caster. It did not protect the caster from items thrown at them by an undead, magical attacks or ranged weapons.

==Casting==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], dust from a tomb or grave which was guarded by the type of undead the caster wished to protect themselves against.
