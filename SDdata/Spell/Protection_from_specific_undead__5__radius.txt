Protection from specific undead, 5 radius was a spell used by the Red Wizards of Thay
This spell was compromised of several sub-spells, each spell targeting a specific type of undead. Each spell had to be memorized individually by the caster. Selected undead were unable to get within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the recipient. This protective area moved with the caster. It did not protect the caster from items thrown at them by an undead, magical attacks or ranged weapons.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, dust from a tomb or grave which was guarded by the type of undead the caster wished to protect themselves against.
