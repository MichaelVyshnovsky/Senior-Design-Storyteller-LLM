        "mainbody": "'''''Eilistraee's moonfire''''' was an [[alteration]] spell granted by the goddess [[Eilistraee]] to her priestesses and, at her will, worshipers.",
        "Effects": "This spell generated ''moonfire'', a beacon of light, whose intensity and color could be controlled by the creator at will, ranging from a faint glow to a clear, bright—though not blinding nor strong enough to harm—light), though ''moonfire'' generally had the same intensity as moonlight. Colors could be white, silver, blue-white, or a soft green.\n\nManifested ''moonfire'' was normally always attached to the caster's body, but could move as the creator wished. More experienced clerics, however, could move the ''moonfire'' away from their bodies, like the spell ''[[dancing lights]]''. The radiance could move around the creator's body as fast as desired, but moved only up to 40 feet (12.2) at a time when away from the caster. The caster could guide it in any direction, through any opening, and cause the glow to appear in any size, up to a volume determined by their power.\n\nA casting of ''Eilistraee's moonfire'' lasted a short duration according to the level of the caster, but it could be dismissed at will, and concentration was not required to maintain it.\n\nThis spell and the ''[[darkness]]'' spell negated each other.",
        "Casters": "All full specialty priests, or [[sword dancers]], of Eilistraee could cast ''Eilistraee's moonfire'' through an act of will, or cast it as a spell.\n\nEilistraee herself could also create ''moonfire'' at will.",
        "Uses": "It was generally used as a light source for reading, to see in the dark, and as a signal for communication.\n\nEilistraee also occasionally chose to gift a male follower or a follower with no priestly powers who nevertheless did her work with the power to temporarily ability to manifest her ''moonfire'', as per this spell. This could be to show her blessing or support, or simply to provide some light. However, the lucky bearer had no control over the ''moonfire'''s duration, intensity, or location—such things were solely up to the goddess."
