Slowspell was a rare alteration spell used by wizards and chronomancers.
Slowspell delayed the effects of spells cast within its area of effect. This spell affected an area centered on the caster, an object, or something in motion, all of which needed to be determined during the casting. The length of time a spell was delayed depended on the expertise of the slowspell caster, but could be up to several minutes. The slowspell casters own spells were immune to the delaying effect while the spell was active.
A slowspell remained active until triggered by a spell cast within its protected area. Once activated, the slowspells duration was dependent on the skill of the caster. Even a successful dispel magic spell would take several minutes to take effect and end the slowspell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a faceted gemstone to cast. The gemstone was consumed during the casting.
