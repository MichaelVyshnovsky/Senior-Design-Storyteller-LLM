Crown meld was an arcane alteration spell that allowed mages to securely repair a fragile item, or bind components together into a shell that can later be enchanted into a magical item.
This spell would link a series of preexisting fusions, such as those created by Meralds meld, in items that were composed of four or more substances. This new shell was considered completely whole, continuous and flawless and ready to receive dweomers from focal stones or existing enchanted items.
The material components for this spell were a thumb-sized lump of resin, an iron nail, a strand of spider silk, paste made from legumes and a flawless diamond, worth at least 2000 gp.
