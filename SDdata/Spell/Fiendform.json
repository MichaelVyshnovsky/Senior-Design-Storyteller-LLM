        "mainbody": "Fiendform was an alteration/transmutation spell that allowed the caster to assume the appearance, and some of the abilities of a fiend from the Outer Planes.\nFor the duration of the spell, the caster assumed the form of any fiendish being, even a baatezu, tanarri or yugoloth however they became adept with many other abilities of the creature they became.\nAnything that occurred to the spellcaster while in the fiendform still affected them once its duration was over. If they were killed before the spell ended, they had the chance of dying once they reverted to their normal form. While it was possible for the spellcaster to simply fall into a coma for a matter of hours, it was more likely their death would send them to the Abyss, reformed as a mane. If this was the case, their body could not be resurrected upon the Prime Material plane.\nThe fiendish form the caster transformed into was entirely random,The Spellbound campaign guide refers to this creature as a bar-igura. cambion, chasme, dergholoth, mezzoloth, nabassu, nycaloth, succubus, vrock or yugoloth. The versions more popular around  afforded the same degree of control over the final shape as a regular summoning.\nThe spell could only be cast by evil-aligned arcane spellcasters. It required verbal and somatic components as well as a crystal statue of any type of fiend, worth at least 3000 gp. While the statue was destroyed upon the end of fiendforms duration, its premature destruction resulted in a similarly early end of the spells effects.\nThe transmutation version of this spell lacked the somatic component to its casting, and rather consumed the material component of a single bone of any fiendish creature or half-fiend.\n* Maligor\n* Jesanta Beril"
