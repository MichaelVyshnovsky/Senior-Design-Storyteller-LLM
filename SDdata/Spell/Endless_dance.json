        "mainbody": "Endless dance was a powerful divine enchantment spell used by specialty priests devoted to Shiallia called Woodwives, enabling them to seduce a victim to dance.\nThis spell compelled anyone near the caster to partake in a korred circle dance, ignoring everything else and focusing on dancing around the caster. The caster was required to stand in the center of the circle, spinning slowly while singing the song of the korreds. Anyone participating in the dance continued to suffer physical injury until they died, the spell ended, or they were restrained. This physical harm was greatly diminished and slowed for any followers of Shiallia or anyone who voluntarily joined the dance.\nThere was a small chance that Shiallia would appear within the center of the dance to aid the caster.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
