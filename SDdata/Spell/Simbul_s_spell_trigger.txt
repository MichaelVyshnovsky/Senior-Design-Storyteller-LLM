The Simbuls spell trigger was a wizard spell from the schools of alteration, conjuration and evocation. This spell was created by the Simbul.
This spell was used in conjunction with one to four other spells that were cast immediately after the spell trigger was memorized. The spells could be identical and could even be cast by other individuals. Divine spells could even be used. A word was added during the casting of each spell added to the spell trigger that would later release the spell when spoken.
The trigger words could be spoken back to back, releasing the magic of all stored spells at the same time in the order in which they were initially cast. The effects of these stored spells was always maximized. The caster needed to see a target for a spell to affect them.
This spell only required verbal components to cast.
