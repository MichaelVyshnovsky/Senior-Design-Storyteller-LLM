        "Effects": "This spell changed the caster and possibly a few companions into clouds of misty vapor and could travel very rapidly, borne by a magical breeze. When viewed by an individual not affected by the spell, the caster resembled a cloud of fog.\n\nA caster could use this spell to travel between two atmospheres in [[wildspace]], but did not bring any breathable air with them. If the spell expired while they were still in wildspace, they became adrift.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The materials required were [[fire]] and [[holy water]]."
