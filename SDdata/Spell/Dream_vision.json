        "mainbody": "Dream vision was a common spell used by shugenja and wu jen. It was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWith this spell, the caster was able to send a message to another via dreams. For the spell to be cast successfully, the caster was required to know the identity of the recipient of the dream vision. When the somatic and verbal components of the spell were complete, the caster entered into a deep sleep, and their spirit left their body. The spirit of the caster would travel instantly to the location of the target recipient. The caster was then able to deliver a message of any length, which the subject remembered perfectly when awoken. The spell only offered one-way communication the subject was unable to communicate with the caster. The spell could not be used to gather information on the subjects dream nor location. When the caster finished delivering the message, their spirit instantly returned to their body. \nIf the recipient was awake, the caster could either remain asleep until the subject fell asleep, or cancel the spell. The spirit was able to enter the dream if the subject was warded against spirits. If the casters body was disturbed while their spirit was away, the spell would be broken and the casters spirit would be unable to return to their body, which entered a comatose state. A restore spell was able to return the spirit of the caster to their body.\nThe reverse of this spell was nightmare vision. It was similar to dream vision but this spell allowed the caster to send dreadful and horrifying images to the subject. The subject would not have a restful sleep, and if the subject was a spellcaster, they would not retain any learned spells. \nThe casters spirit was unable to enter or leave a crystal sphere. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components. When cast by a wu jen, a bowl of incense was required. If cast by a shugenja, the spell required, along with a bowl of incense, the priest to be wearing a silk robe of red or white."
