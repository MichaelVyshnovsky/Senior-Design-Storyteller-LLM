Tracking was an uncommon spell used by druids.
By means of this spell, the caster was capable of detecting psychic impressions left by creatures who passed in a targeted area. The caster held an item that was associated with the targeted creature and used the object to attune to the targeted creatures psychic pattern. If successfully, the psychic trace appears as a glowing pattern to the caster. The pattern glowed brighter if the targeted creature passed though the area recently. The psychic pattern were visible for up to two days. This spell was capable of detecting the psychic impressions of a creature using the pass without trace spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, the item associated with the targeted creature, such as an item of clothing.
