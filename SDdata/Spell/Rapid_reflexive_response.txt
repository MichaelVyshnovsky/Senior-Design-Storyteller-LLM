'''''Rapid reflexive response''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Halruaa]].

==Effects==
[[Ramael the Reader]] created this spell, but many [[Halruaan]]s credited [[Mycontil]].

When cast, this spell allowed the caster to snatch any missile weighing less than 7 lbs. (3.2 kg ) out of the air and immediately throw it back at their attacker with startling accuracy. One object could be grabbed with each hand.

This spell would also enhance the speed of any hand-related movement by the caster for its duration. Because of this, the caster would need to end the spell before attempting to cast a different spell.

==Components==
This spell required a glove that was once worn by a throwing weapons specialist (or a [[halfling]]), a shaving of licorice root, and a frog's tongue to cast.
