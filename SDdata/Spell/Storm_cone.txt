Storm cone was a divine alteration and evocation spell used by priests devoted to Talos, enabling them to create a swirling vortex of wind.
This spell created a powerful vortex of wind measuring  in length. The caster was able to slowly move the storm cone around, buffeting anyone within the cone with small invisible stones and tiny sparks of lightning. The power of the storm cone prevented anyone within the cone from doing anything by struggling to get free.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
