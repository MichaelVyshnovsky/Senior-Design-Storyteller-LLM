'''''Storm cone''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Talos]], enabling them to create a swirling vortex of wind.

The caster was able to slowly move the ''storm cone'' around, buffeting anyone within the cone with small invisible stones and tiny sparks of lightning. The power of the ''storm cone'' prevented anyone within the cone from doing anything by struggling to get free.

==Components==
