Eye of Mystra was a wizard spell from the schools of alteration and invocation.
This spell could only be used by true followers of Mystra. Anyone else casting this spell would only see a large eye appear that would wink at them and then disappear. This spell created a beautiful eye the size of a human head. The pupil of the eye was deep blue and it had long lashes.
The eye could cast an unerring ray of blue light at a single creature or item at a time that was chosen by the caster. The ray removed all forms of magic, including memorized spells, from anything it touched with the exception of powerful artifacts. This also affected magical aging and longevity which were reversed. The effect on magic items was permanent, but spellcasters were not hindered from re-memorizing their lost spells.
Chosen of Mystra were immune to this spell.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast.
