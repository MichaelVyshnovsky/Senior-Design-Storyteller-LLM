}}'''''Eye of Mystra''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the schools of [[alteration]] and [[invocation]].

==Effects==
This spell could only be used by true followers of [[Mystra]]. Anyone else casting this spell would only see a large eye appear that would wink at them and then disappear. This spell created a beautiful eye the size of a [[human]] head. The pupil of the eye was deep blue and it had long lashes.

The eye could cast an unerring ray of blue light at a single creature or item at a time that was chosen by the caster. The ray removed all forms of magic, including memorized spells, from anything it touched with the exception of powerful [[artifact]]s. This also affected magical aging and longevity which were reversed. The effect on [[magic item]]s was permanent, but spellcasters were not hindered from re-memorizing their lost spells.

[[Chosen]] of Mystra were immune to this spell.

==Components==
This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.
