'''''Baleful polymorph''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that could change the form of a creature against its will.

==Effects==
The spell changed the form of a creature into that of an animal of small stature like that of a [[dog]] or [[ape]] at the choice of the caster. The target retained its philosophical orientation. The same applied to its hardiness and its capacity to understand languages. If the target was a [[shapechanger]] in the first place, then they remained so{{Cite web/Player's Handbook v.3.5 Errata|2}}

The target lost all its other capabilities and because the body was changed, the target's equipment fell to the ground.

If the new chosen form was one that was unable to live in the current environment the creature was in,&mdash;for example, the form of a fish on the ground&mdash;the creature had an easier time to resist the forceful shapechange.

Once changed, the target remained in the new form for an indefinite time. Whatever form the new one was, if the target did not find a way to revert its form in twenty-four hours, its mental faculties degenerated to those of the new form.

Creatures with gaseous or incorporeal bodies were immune to the spell.

==Components==
''Baleful polymorph'' was a spell that required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
