        "mainbody": "Jesters jest was a wizardly alteration spell from the 2 circle of magic that could render even the happiest laughing creature serious in an instant.\nWhen cast upon a creature, jesters jest stripped the target from all happy and jovial inclinations, rendering them serious, unless the target was able to resist the spells effect. While jesters jest remained active, all of the targets words came out sad, depressing, and sorrowful, spreading their demoralizing influence to all who listened, slowing their reactions and mental sharpness. The duration of the spell increased with the casters proficiencies with the Art.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and material components to be cast.\nThe jesters jest spells creation was attributed to a curiously named jester who served King Azoun Obarskyr I of Cormyr, Lendolin the Laughless."
