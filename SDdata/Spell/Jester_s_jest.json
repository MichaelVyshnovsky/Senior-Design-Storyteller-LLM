        "mainbody": "'''''Jester's jest''''' was a [[wizard]]ly [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the 2{{nd}} circle of magic that could render even the happiest laughing creature serious in an instant.",
        "Effects": "When cast upon a creature, ''jester's jest'' stripped the target from all happy and jovial inclinations, rendering them serious, unless the target was able to resist the spell's effect. While ''jester's jest'' remained active, all of the target's words came out sad, depressing, and sorrowful, spreading their demoralizing influence to all who listened, slowing their reactions and mental sharpness. The duration of the spell increased with the caster's proficiencies with [[the Art]].",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s to be cast.",
        "History": "The ''jester's jest'' spell's creation was attributed to a curiously named [[jester]] who served King [[Azoun Obarskyr I]] of [[Cormyr]], [[Lendolin]] the Laughless."
