'''''Weave mythal''''' was a [[spell]] that was commonly used in [[Myth Drannor]] and [[Netheril]].

==Effects==
When cast, this spell allowed the [[magic]] of the caster or a targeted creature to be immune to the influence of a [[mythal]]. It also prevented power fluctuations, augmentations, and influence from [[wild magic]]. This spell was vulnerable to ''[[dispel magic]]''.

The older version of this spell, used by [[arcanist]]s in Netheril, had a different effect. This spell created an impenetrable sphere around an area. To gain access through the sphere, an individual required an activation key. The sphere's barrier prevented any living creatures, [[construct]]s, and [[undead]] from crossing the perimeter. The caster was able to attach an additional spell to the mythal, which activated if a creature tried to cross the sphere's barrier without the proper activation key. The width of the sphere was {{SI|300|ft}}, which increased based on the caster's skill level.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components. The spell used by arcanists required verbal and [[material component]]s.

==History==
The spell was invented in {{Yearlink|-2118}} by [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Lefeber]]. It was thus known in Netheril as '''''Lefeber's weave mythal'''''.<ref>
