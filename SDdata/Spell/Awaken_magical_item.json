        "mainbody": "Awaken magical item was a divine enchantment and invocation spell that resembled a lesser version of the enchant an item spell.\nThis spell permanently activated a magic item with multiple functions when touched. This spell was used in conjuction with eternal flame, wondrous web or holy vesting, and multiple dweomerflow castings. This spell could be used on a previously created magic item in order to add new magical functions to the item.\nA successful awakening usually involved a flash of harmless light upon the spells completion, otherwise the magic item would either crumble into useless dust or explode violently.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a priest spell scroll containing at least as many spells as the item had functions, a gemstone worth at least 2,500 gp for each item function, and a living plant that had been changed by magic to cast.\nThis spell was incredibly rare according to Volothamp Geddarm."
