Shadow form was a powerful arcane necromancy spell that temporarily transformed the caster into a shadow.
The caster gained all of the strengths, abilities, and weaknesses of a shadow for the duration of the spell. Any gear carried by the caster was taken with them into shadow form, but could not be used while the spell remained active. The caster was also unable to cast any new spells in this form. There was a very slight chance that the caster would remain in shadow form permanently when the spell ended.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a black marble and a shroud from a corpse at least 100 years old to cast.
* Shadow stalkers, specialty priests of Eshowdow, could cast the shadow form spell.
