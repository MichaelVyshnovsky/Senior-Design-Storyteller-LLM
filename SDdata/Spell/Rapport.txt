'''''Rapport''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[thought sphere]] that was an improved version of ''[[telepathy]]''.

==Effects==
''Rapport'' allowed the casting [[priest]] to communicate silently and instantly with a willing subject. Both participants could also share deeper thoughts, including memories and emotions, than what was possible through ''telepathy''. The participants could also experience everything the other sensed through all five senses. The casting priest could establish multiple connections with ''rapport'', but each new connection required a new casting of the spell.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.

==History==
The ''[[Scepter of Mystra]]'', a relic of the [[Mystra]]n faith, could cast the ''rapport'' spell.{{cite book/Prayers from the Faithful|77-80}}
