Plungesoil was a spell that dug holes in dirt.
The spell dug a cylindrical shaft 6 feet deep, but only 7 inches in diameter, within one minute it stayed in the air, above the casters head level, for up to another minute if the caster would not cancel it. By the third minute, it would, at the casters option, crumble into dirt, or return to its original position, not showing any signs of disturbance. The shaft could also be made to burst into a cloud of dirt clumps, which would attack all targets within  and potentially blind them or break fragile objects in their possession.
The spell didnt work on stone, or on earth covered with water, ice, or snow.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a pinch of earth and a sliver of metal from what was once a digging tool.
Azuth made this spell available through Elminster sometime prior to
