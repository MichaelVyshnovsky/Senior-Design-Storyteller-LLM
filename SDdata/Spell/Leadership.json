        "mainbody": "Leadership was a divine alteration and enchantment spell from the war sphere that boosted the targets command radius on the field of battle.\nAny target within the casters line of sight could be used for this spell. The spell could also be used within a temple dedicated to the casters deity if an elaborate ritual was performed. This version of the spell lasted much longer.\nThe reverse of this spell, doubt, had the opposite effect and reduced the command radius of the target.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a pinch of steel dust to cast.\nDivine minions, magical servitors of the gods of the Mulhorandi pantheon, were immune to the effects of the doubt spell."
