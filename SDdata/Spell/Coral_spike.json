        "mainbody": "'''''Coral spike''''' was a formidable [[spell]] known for its ability to harness the internal coral skeleton of a [[Dukar]] and bring it to life.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell triggered the growth of menacing, barbed spikes within the Dukar's body. These spikes delved deep, targeting vital organs and inflicting substantial damage while temporarily incapacitating the Dukar. The excruciating pain endured during the spell's effects rendered the Dukar unable to take any actions, reducing them to a state of vulnerability.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]]."
