        "mainbody": "Coral spike was a formidable spell known for its ability to harness the internal coral skeleton of a Dukar and bring it to life.\nWhen cast, this spell triggered the growth of menacing, barbed spikes within the Dukars body. These spikes delved deep, targeting vital organs and inflicting substantial damage while temporarily incapacitating the Dukar. The excruciating pain endured during the spells effects rendered the Dukar unable to take any actions, reducing them to a state of vulnerability.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component."
