        "mainbody": "Drawmijs marvelous shield was an arcane evocation spell that improved upon the shield spell.\nWhen summoned, a marvelous shield offered protection for the caster on all sides and from above so long as the caster saw the attack coming. Any sneak attack upon the caster would bypass the protection of the shield.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThis spell was developed by the Oerthan wizard Drawmij but was used on Toril."
