Shine was a useful cantrip that wizards-in-training could learn. It was an adjunct to the polish cantrip that removed corrosion, tarnish, rust, verdigris, and similar signs of age and neglect from objects. It could also enhance below-average quality gems.
This cantrip could affect one object of up to  in volume per casting. Shine smoothed out any small imperfections, removed specks of rust or patinas of tarnish, and, if the surface of the object could support it, brought out a mirror-quality luster. It could be used to clean jewelry and could even give below-average quality gems a chance to be appraised a bit higher in value. Like similar cantrips, the target object had to be within  of the caster.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster hummed a simple tune while making buffing motions with a hand.
