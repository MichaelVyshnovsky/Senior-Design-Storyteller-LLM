        "mainbody": "Internal fire was a powerful spell commonly used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur, although some fire mages in Faer√ªn knew of the spell.\nWhen cast, this spell created a fatally intense amount of heat inside a target. The target eventually burst into flame, killing them instantly. If the target had an item or equipment that gave fire resistance, they were unaffected by the spell. A creature with a natural immunity to fire would also be unaffected by this spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, an iron canister filled with hot charcoal."
