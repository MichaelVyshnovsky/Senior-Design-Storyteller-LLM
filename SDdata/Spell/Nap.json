        "mainbody": "'''''Nap''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell placed a targeted creature into an hour-long nap. The nap, despite being so short, rejuvenated the recipient as if they had a restful full night of sleep. The spell could only be cast once on a creature per eighteen hours. The spell could only function on a willing creature.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, a feather, a piece of pillow ticking and a pebble. The pebble had to be in the pocket of the caster for seven consecutive nights.",
        "History": "This spell was inscribed within ''[[Wythyndle's Round Book]]'', one of the few [[holy book]]s of the [[Church of Milil]]. It could also be cast by the ''[[Scepter of Mystra]]'', a relic of the faith of [[Mystra]].{{cite book/Prayers from the Faithful|77-80}}"
