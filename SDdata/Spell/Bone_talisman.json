        "mainbody": "'''Bone talisman''' was a spell used to enchant bones, granting them powers against [[undead]] creatures.{{Cite web/Earthmother's Weapons}}",
        "Effects": "This spell insufflated the divine power of life into a bone, granting it special powers against undead creatures. Casting the spell required a minute-long ritual, during which the caster had to make physical contact with the bone it wanted to enchant. During this ritual, the caster had to choose between one of two effects.\n\nThe first possible effect transformed the bone into a talisman of ''turning'', allowing druids to use it to [[turn undead]] by presenting it in the same way a [[cleric]] would use a [[holy symbol]]. The second effect shaped the bone into a weapon which was particularly effective against undead foes.\nThe changes were not permanent: both effects only kept their potency for a limited time.",
        "Components": "The bone used as target by this spell had to come from the corpse of an humanoid or an animal, but couldn't belong to an undead creature regardless of what it was in life. The bone needed to be at least {{SI|8|inches|c|long=true}} long&mdash;for this reason casters would usually favor bones from the arm, legs, or ribs.",
        "History": "Bone Talisman was one of four original spells created by the Chauntean druid [[Bryn Kernwyld]], and published in the book ''[[Earthmother's Weapons]]''. While the precise creation date of the spell was unknown, sages agreed that it was likely anterior to 1000 [[DR]]. The spell was devised by Byrn to help her brethren during the wars which opposed the forces of [[Malar]] and [[Bhaal]] and the civilized people of the [[Moonshae Isles]]. It proved a great help to minimize the damage wars caused to the surrounding nature.\n\nAfter its creation, knowledge of this spell was passed down between druids by oral tradition, while the actual tome was kept safe by senior members of their order.\n\nLong after its creation, Bryn's book found itself in the hands of a Malarite druid going by the name of [[Galast]]. Ignoring the origin of the book, Galast learnt and used the spells described therein. His deity, considering the spells useful, granted him access to these spells."
