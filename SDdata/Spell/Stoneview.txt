'''''Stoneview''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed [[wizard]]s to see through a mass of stone.<ref name=SC-p27" />

==Effects==
This spell allowed a caster to turn a mass of stone temporarily transparent, allowing the caster to see through it as if it wasn't there. The mass of stone that could be affected varied with the skill of the spellcaster, with the lowest possible being {{SI|40|sq ft|long=yes}}. The distance at which it could be cast and the spell's duration also varied with the skill of the spellcaster, with the lowest possible being a distance of {{SI|15|yards|long=yes}} and a duration of 5 minutes.<ref name=SC-p27" />

==Components==
In addition to requiring [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s, casting ''stoneview'' required a [[material component]] in the form of the stone that was to be the target of the spell.<ref name=SC-p27" />

==History==
In the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR, the [[earth]] [[elementalist]] [[Maurice Stone]] had this spell activate within his lair when a group of [[adventurer]]s confronted him over the kidnapping of [[Lauren DeVillars]].<ref name=SC-p27" />
