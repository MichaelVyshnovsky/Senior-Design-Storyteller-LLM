Aganazzars amanuensisThe inventors name is spelled like Agannazar in Ed Greenwoods tweets describing the spell, a spelling chiefly used in 1e and 2e materials, but the favored spelling in 5e materials is Aganazzar, per the Xanathars Guide to Everything version of Aganazzars scorcher. was a spell that added a dozen blank leaves to a targeted book.
When cast, the targeted book gained a dozen additional leaves (meaning 24 pages, one for both sides of each leaf) made from the same material as the pre-existing ones, and placed a hovering ink-dipped quill above them. The quill would stop hovering the moment it was touched by a living being.
It was said by Elminster that spells written upon pages created through Aganazzars amanuensis were prone to instability, and that this instability worsened over time and further pages added with the spell.
Any pages added with this spell increased a books weight the same way nonmagical pages would.
This spell required and consumed a quill, a wooden stick, and a cured and cleansed animal hide in its casting.
