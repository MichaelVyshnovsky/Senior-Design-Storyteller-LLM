'''''Aganazzar's amanuensis'''''<ref group=note name="nn/zz">The inventor's name is spelled like Aga'''nn'''a'''z'''ar in Ed Greenwood's tweets describing the spell, a spelling chiefly used in 1e and 2e materials, but the favored spelling in 5e materials is Aga'''n'''a'''zz'''ar, per the ''[[Xanathar's Guide to Everything]]'' version of ''[[Aganazzar's scorcher]]''. was a spell that added a dozen blank leaves to a targeted [[book]].{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1232757800142622722 | title = Ed Greenwood on Twitter | accessdate = 06-16-2020 | author = [[Ed Greenwood]] | 02-26-2020 }}

==Effects==
When cast, the targeted book gained a dozen additional leaves (meaning 24 pages, one for both sides of each leaf) made from the same material as the pre-existing ones, and placed a hovering [[ink]]-dipped [[quill]] above them. The quill would stop hovering the moment it was touched by a living being.

It was said by [[Elminster]] that spells written upon pages created through ''Aganazzar's amanuensis'' were prone to instability, and that this instability worsened over time and further pages added with the spell.

Any pages added with this spell increased a book's weight the same way nonmagical pages would.{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1232822343195598848 | title = Ed Greenwood on Twitter | accessdate = 06-16-2020 | author = [[Ed Greenwood]] | 02-27-2020 }}

==Components==
This spell required and consumed a quill, a wooden stick, and a cured and cleansed animal hide in its casting.
