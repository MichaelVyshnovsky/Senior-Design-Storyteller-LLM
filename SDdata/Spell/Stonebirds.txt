'''''Stonebirds''''' was a [[divine]] [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Ilmater]] and by [[avenging spirit]]s.
 
==Effects==
When cast, this spell summoned a flock of up to twenty [[bird]]s, who were then transformed into living stone. Despite being made from stone, the birds retained their normal avian qualities, including the power of flight. The flock was under the command of the caster, and could be directed to peck at foes, inflicting injury, or even fly into targets, but they died on impact.

The birds remained as living stone for ten minutes, or until they were killed. Once this spell expired, the birds were transformed back to normal and no longer under the command of the caster.

==Components==
This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.

==Notable Users==
* [[Sigfrieda]], a.k.a. Sunshine, the avenging spirit of [[Crystal Spring]], north of [[Ravens Bluff]]<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/91/The Living City: The Swineherd's House|13,17}}
