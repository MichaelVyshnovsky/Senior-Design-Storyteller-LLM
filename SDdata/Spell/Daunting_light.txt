Daunting light was an encounter prayer available to clerics during the post-Spellplague era that would hurt and hinder opponents with radiant light.
Casting daunting light upon a target creature caused a fiery column of light to engulf them, burning the opponent with radiant energy and causing their movements to be hindered for a short time. This allowed one of the casters nearby allies a more advantageous position in combat when striking against the target.
