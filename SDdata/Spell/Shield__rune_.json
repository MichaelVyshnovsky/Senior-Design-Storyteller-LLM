        "mainbody": "Shield, otherwise known in the giant language as skold, was a defensive type of giant rune.\nWhen inscribed with this rune a shields protective properties were enhanced. This effect would last for the duration of a single battle.\nIf this rune was extensively studied a second or third time, then this effect would be even greater.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast. The process of shaping this rune generally took around ten to eighty minutes and it needed to be inscribed upon a shield."
