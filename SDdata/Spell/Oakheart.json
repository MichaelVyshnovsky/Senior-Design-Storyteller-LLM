        "mainbody": "'''''Oakheart''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Silvanus]], enabling them to create a link between themselves and an [[oak]] tree.",
        "Effects": "This spell created a bond between the caster, or a touched recipient, and an oak tree. After the spell was cast, any harm for the next three minutes experienced by the caster would actually be transferred to the oak tree instead. This included magical and nonmagical harm. The caster would suffer a permanent loss of health if the tree died from any harm suffered by this spell. Anyone under the influence of an ''oakheart'' spell could not heal normally until the tree was fully recovered. Healing via magical methods was still an option though.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and somatic components, this spell required as a [[material component]] an oak leaf to cast. The recipient was link to the tree from which the leaf came."
