        "mainbody": "Oakheart was a divine alteration and necromancy spell used by priests devoted to Silvanus, enabling them to create a link between themselves and an oak tree.\nThis spell created a bond between the caster, or a touched recipient, and an oak tree. After the spell was cast, any harm for the next three minutes experienced by the caster would actually be transferred to the oak tree instead. This included magical and nonmagical harm. The caster would suffer a permanent loss of health if the tree died from any harm suffered by this spell. Anyone under the influence of an oakheart spell could not heal normally until the tree was fully recovered. Healing via magical methods was still an option though.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component an oak leaf to cast. The recipient was link to the tree from which the leaf came."
