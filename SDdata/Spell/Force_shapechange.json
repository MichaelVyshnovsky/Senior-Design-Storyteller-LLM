        "mainbody": "'''''Force shapechange''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] and [[wizard]]s. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell forced a shapechanger or [[lycanthrope]] to reveal their true form. During casting, the caster pointed at the creature they suspected of being a shapechanger. Transferring into their true form took several minutes and was extremely painful for the shapechanger.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a live butterfly. It was released while the shugenja uttered the verbal components. The arcane version of this spell required an additional material component, the hair from a lycanthrope."
