        "mainbody": "Force shapechange was a common spell used by shugenja and wizards. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, this spell forced a shapechanger or lycanthrope to reveal their true form. During casting, the caster pointed at the creature they suspected of being a shapechanger. Transferring into their true form took several minutes and was extremely painful for the shapechanger.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a live butterfly. It was released while the shugenja uttered the verbal components. The arcane version of this spell required an additional material component, the hair from a lycanthrope."
