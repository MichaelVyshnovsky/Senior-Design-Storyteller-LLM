The forms ranged in size from tiny [[gorse]] to as large as [[voadkyn]]. Other fey forms the caster could choose included [[atomie]], [[brownie]], [[dobie]], [[dryad]], [[grig]], [[hamadryad]], [[killmoulis]], [[korred]], [[leprechaun]], [[nixie]], [[nymph]], [[pixie]], [[satyr]], [[sylph]], [[sprite]] and [[sea sprite]]. The caster was unable to use this spell to transform into non-humanoid forms such as [[centaur]] or [[unicorn]].\n\nThe caster, in their new form, gained the natural mobility and breathing ability of their new form. This spell did not allows the caster to use their new form's other abilities, such as innate magical powers. The caster was also not at risk of their personality and mentality changing to match their new form. They retained all the normal mental abilities, including casting knowledge. The caster was capable of casting additional spells in their new form. Any equipment that was on the caster's person was melded into their new form.",
