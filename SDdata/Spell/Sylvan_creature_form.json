        "mainbody": "Sylvan creature form was a spell used by clerics of Corellon Larethian.\nWhen cast, this spell temporarily transformed the body of the caster to that of any good-aligned humanoid sylvan. The forms ranged in size from tiny gorse to as large as voadkyn. Other fey forms the caster could choose included atomie, brownie, dobie, dryad, grig, hamadryad, killmoulis, korred, leprechaun, nixie, nymph, pixie, satyr, sylph, sprite and sea sprite. The caster was unable to use this spell to transform into non-humanoid forms such as centaur or unicorn.\nThe caster, in their new form, gained the natural mobility and breathing ability of their new form. This spell did not allows the caster to use their new forms other abilities, such as innate magical powers. The caster was also not at risk of their personality and mentality changing to match their new form. They retained all the normal mental abilities, including casting knowledge. The caster was capable of casting additional spells in their new form. Any equipment that was on the casters person was melded into their new form.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, the holy symbol of Corellon Larethian."
