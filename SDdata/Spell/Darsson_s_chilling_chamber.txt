Darssons chilling chamber was an arcane spell that lowered the temperature of an area to extremely cold levels for hours at a time. It would damage any creatures vulnerable to cold and chill anyone in metal armor similar to the chill metal spell. These effects could be made permanent via the casting of permanency.
This spell was originally made to preserve food in cellars, but creative wizards adapted its use as a defensive deterrent or creating a more habitable environment their cold-loving pets and familiars.
