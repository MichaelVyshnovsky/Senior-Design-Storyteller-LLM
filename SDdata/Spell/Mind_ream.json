        "mainbody": "'''''Mind ream''''' is a spell unique to the [[War Wizards]] of [[Cormyr]] that allows the mage to extract information from a person's mind.  The spell often leaves the victim's mind in ruins. \n\nWith the changes to the [[magic]]al weave after the [[Spellplague]], the spell often destroys the mind of the caster as well as the victim.  Terminally ill War Wizards sometimes volunteer to cast the ''mind ream'' spell as a last service to Cormyr.",
