        "mainbody": "'''''Aura of comfort''''' was an [[evocation]] spell that allowed the recipient to ignore normal extremes of non-magical heat or cold, and be protected from rain, snow, and hail.",
        "Effects": "This spell lasted for a few hours; longer for more experienced casters, and created a faint aura that shimmered around the subject. The recipient and all they were wearing or carrying were insulated from cold or heat in the &minus;20&deg; F to 140&deg; F (&minus;29&deg; C to 60&deg; C) temperature range and instead perceived a comfortable 70&deg; F (21&deg; C) for the duration of the spell. In addition, ''aura of comfort'' protected the recipient from non-magical rain, snow, and hail by blocking them from reaching the subject. If the temperature exceeded the range that this spell could handle, then the perceived temperature was increased or decreased one degree for every degree beyond the range.\n\n''Aura of comfort'' did not protect against magically generated weather, fire, cold-based attacks, smoke, suffocation, etc.\n\nThe reverse of this spell was ''[[aura of discomfort]]'' which had the opposite effects.",
        "Components": "Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell."
