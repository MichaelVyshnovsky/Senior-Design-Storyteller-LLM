'''''Andrui's baneful backfire''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] from the 5{{th}} circle of magic invented by Andrui of [[Oerth]] and designed to protect a [[wizard]]'s active [[enchantment]]s and [[magical item]]s.

==Effects==
The spell's target was an active ensorcellment, be it magic made ''[[Permanency|permanent]]'' or a creature temporarily ''[[slow]]ed'' down, or an [[enchanted]] item located within the caster's eyesight. After being cast, ''Andrui's baneful backfire'' remained dormant until an attempt was made to magically tamper or ''[[Dispel magic|dispel]]'' the spell's target. Firstly, once triggered, ''baneful backfire'' automatically caused all attempts to ''dispel'' magic to fail. The shock caused by that failure also burned a single spell out of the caster's memory. The lost spell was of an equal level as the spell that was being dispelled. If the caster did not have a spell of such level in their memory, the ''baneful backfire'' burned a spell of the next lower circle of magic. The spell's only limitation was the power of its caster. Only a spellcaster more powerful than the mage who placed ''Andrui's baneful backfire'' could dispel the enchantment in question as well as the ''baneful backfire'' cast upon it.

==Components==
''Andrui's baneful backfire'' required [[verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s to be cast. Its material components were a square 3-inch (7.6 centimeters) piece of [[carpet]] and a small clump of [[cat]] hair.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the ''[[Wail of the Banshee]]'', a ship made of bone that belonged to [[Mezzalcat]], a [[drow]] [[necromancer]], was protected by the ''Andrui's baneful backfire'' spell. The ship was docked in [[Tradesport]], an island fortress in the [[Sea of Endless Darkness]] in the [[Underdark]] underneath the [[Vast]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Isle of the End|14}}
