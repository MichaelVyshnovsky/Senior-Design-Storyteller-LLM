        "mainbody": "'''''Banishment''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that banished extraplanar beings to their home [[plane]]s.",
        "Effects": "Functioning as a more potent form of ''[[dismissal]]'', ''banishment'' drove extraplanar beings out of the caster's home plane. The number and power of creatures that could be banished increased with the power of the caster. For greater chance of success, the caster had to show one or more items or substances that the creature despised, feared, or was in opposition to. For example, a [[demon]] disliked light and was vulnerable to [[holy water]] and [[cold iron]] weapons, so the caster might use iron, holy water, and a [[torch]] to maximize the spell's effectiveness. Rare and special items could boost its strength.\n\nIf the target was banished in its native plane, it was sent to a harmless demiplane, and if the spell wasn't broken within a minute the creature would remain in its native plane.",
        "Components": "It required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, as well as a focus, and optionally any item the target found distasteful.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Oberon (Netherese arcanist)|Oberon]] in {{Yearlink|-980}} and was originally called '''''Oberon's banish'''''."
