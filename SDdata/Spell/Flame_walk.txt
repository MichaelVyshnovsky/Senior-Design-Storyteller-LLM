'''Flame walk''' was a [[spell]] that granted one or more creatures immunity to normal fires up to the intensity of molten lava.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell allowed the caster or the target creature to withstand non-magical flame of up to 2,000°F (1,093°C) in temperature. The amount of creatures that could be protected by this spell was determined by the caster's skill level. The spell did not augment other fire-resistant spells such as ''[[resist fire]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s, the [[holy symbol]] of the caster and powdered [[ruby]] valued at least 50[[gp]] per creature.
