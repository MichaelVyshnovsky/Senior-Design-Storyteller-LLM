Flame walk was a spell that granted one or more creatures immunity to normal fires up to the intensity of molten lava.
When cast, the spell allowed the caster or the target creature to withstand non-magical flame of up to 2,000°F (1,093°C) in temperature. The amount of creatures that could be protected by this spell was determined by the casters skill level. The spell did not augment other fire-resistant spells such as resist fire.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, the holy symbol of the caster and powdered ruby valued at least 50gp per creature.
