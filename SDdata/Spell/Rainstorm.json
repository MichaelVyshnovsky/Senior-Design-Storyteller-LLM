        "Effects": "The ''rainstorm'' spell conjured forth a {{SIAdj|30|ft|long=yes}} square area of strong magical rain within their eyesight. The rain damaged all creatures of cold or fiery nature as long as the spell lasted. Additionally, all creatures within the ''rainstorm'' area had a [[coin]]toss of a chance of being struck by a lightning every six seconds they spent within the area of the spell's effect. All flaming spells, such as ''[[flame blade]]'' or ''[[fire shroud]]'', and [[fire elemental]] effects, such as the blazing aura of a [[salamander]], were immediately extinguished. The spell lasted for twelve seconds."
