'''''Power word, deafen''''', was a powerful [[spell]] from the [[enchantment]] school that could be wielded by both [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
After the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the spell was able to [[deafen]] a creature permanently or temporarily. The length of the effect was dependent on the target's health. The weaker the creature, the greater the risk of it being deafened permanently. 

The spell only worked on creatures, under a certain average degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the [[Arcane magic|spellcaster]].

==Components==
The spell required only a [[verbal component]], which was the uttering of the power word itself.

==Usage==
The spell could be wielded by both [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.
