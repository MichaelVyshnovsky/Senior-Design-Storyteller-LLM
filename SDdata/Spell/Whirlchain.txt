Whirlchain was a divine evocation spell that created a chain that battered ones foe.
The spell conjured a chain around the target creature in a helix fashion, that then whipped and battered the victim before disappearing.
The spell required a metal chain of any kind and any length longer than the casters own hand.
The whirlchain spell appeared within the Tome of Torment, the holiest book of the church of Ilmater, which first appeared in the Realms in 848 DR.
