        "mainbody": "Mordenkainens protection from slime was an uncommon protection spell.\nWhen cast, the caster was given protection from molds, oozes, puddings and slimes. It also protected against other primordial creatures with no form. The spell itself was vulnerable to attack by a slime-based creature, if said creature was strong enough, they could cause the spell to expire prematurely.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a piece of mold from spoiled food mixed with a small amount of dust from a diamond, squished between two stones."
