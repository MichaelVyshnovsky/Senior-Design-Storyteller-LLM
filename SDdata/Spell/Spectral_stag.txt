Spectral stag was an illusion spell that conjured a spectral stag that charged from the caster for a short duration.
The stag appeared as a smoky apparition with glowing red eyes. It rushed from the caster in a straight line, for a length of , goring persons or creatures along the way. The path of the stags charge remained on a flat plane, bypassing any chasms or pits.
The spectral stag could be dispelled and destroyed by antimagic fields.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a hoof, antler, or bone taken from a naturally living deer.
The specifications of this spell were outlined in the Malarite relic, the Book of Fangs and Talons.
