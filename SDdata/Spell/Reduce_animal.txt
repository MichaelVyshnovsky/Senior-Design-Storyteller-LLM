Reduce animal was a transmutation spell used by druids and rangers to shrink one animal to half its size. The animal had to acquiesce for the transformation to work.
This spell required verbal and somatic components only.
The reversed form of the more powerful spell animal growth, shrink animal, was sometimes also called reduce animal, but was in fact a different spell.
