'''''Symphonic nightmare''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that replaced the dreams of an individual with a cacophony of music that sounded as if it was played by an entirely disjointed orchestra.

==Effects==
Whenever the affected individual went to sleep or entered a sleep-like trance they were no longer capable of dreaming. Their sleep was haunted by discordant music and they were unable to get a full night's rest. In addition, they were immune to the effects of other dream-inducing spells such as ''[[dream]]'' or ''[[nightmare]]'', or similar effects such as those caused by the inherent abilities of [[night hag]]s.

The effects of ''symphonic nightmare'' endured for well over a week, depending on the skill and experience of the caster.

==History==
Tvash-Prull developed spells for bards. In his one and only [[Tvash-Prull's symphony|symphony]] he magically embedded this and other spells in the sheet music for it to be discovered by bardic spellcasters who had the ability to detect and decipher the spells.{{Cite dragon/328/Tvash-Prull's Symphony|71}}
