        "mainbody": "Ironwood was a common spell used by wu jen and bisan in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, this spell made wood as strong as steel. The appearance and weight of the wood remained unchanged. The spell could be cast on a living plant, with a 50% chance of success. The plants growth was unaffected but all parts of the plant, including leaves and flowers, became as steel. If cast on a plant-based creature, the spell paralyzed the creature. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, metal filling and the sap of a willow tree."
