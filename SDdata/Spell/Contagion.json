        "mainbody": "'''''Contagion''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that inflicted a horrendous [[disease]] on a target.",
        "Effect": "Older versions of the ''contagion'' spell infected a touched target with a vicious infestation, like boils, lesions, seeping abscesses, blotches, or worse. This would reduce a target's strength, agility, and looks, unless they spent weeks recuperating or a ''[[remove disease]]'' spell was cast on them. If the victim did not get any aid, then the diseases would get even worse.\n\nNewer versions caused specific diseases to infect the target, such as [[blinding sickness]], [[cackle fever]], [[filth fever]], [[flesh rot]], [[mindfire]], [[red ache]], [[seizure]], or [[slimy doom]].",
        "Components": "Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were needed for the casting.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Lucke]] in {{Yearlink|-1745}} and was originally called ''Lucke's contagion''.\n\nA similar spell, known as ''[[plague carrier]]'', inflicted the same diseases as ''contagion'' but as normal illnesses with natural incubation times, allowing the target to unknowingly begin to spread their affliction."
