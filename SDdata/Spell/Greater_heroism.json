        "mainbody": "Greater heroism or superheroism was an enchantment or alteration spell that made the target fight at a level worthy of legends.\nFor the latter, enchantment-based version, the target became braver. The target gained a complete immunity against fear and became better at fighting, at resisting physical attacks and other effects, and at doing generally everything.\nEarlier versions instead operated only on the martially-minded, and only by enhancing their life force. As a result, they fought at a superb, heroic level, and gained phenomenal staying power. However, for those whose prowess was already worthy of legend, the spell did nothing.\nThe spell only required somatic and verbal components. While early clerical versions called for a holy symbol, the wizardly versions called instead for a treants leaf.\nThe spell was very rare and guarded jealously by its grey elf creators by the year ."
