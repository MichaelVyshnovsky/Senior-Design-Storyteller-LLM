        "mainbody": "The '''''lava missile''''' [[spell]] shot forth a projectile of lava, that struck unerringly at a target designated by the caster.",
        "Effects": "Less experienced [[priest]]s casting ''lava missile'' [[conjuration|conjured]] forth a single projectile wheres more powerful [[divine spellcaster]]s summoned up to five.\n\nWhen the missile reached its target it set them aflame, unless they could resist the effect or were otherwise immune. If cast against a [[firenewt]], a ''lava missile'' would actually heal their wounds, as opposed to harming them.",
        "Usage": "The spell was developed and first used by firenewt [[cleric]]s of [[Kossuth]]."
