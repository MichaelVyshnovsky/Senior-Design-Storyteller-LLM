Elemental legion was a powerful druidic conjuration spell that was also granted to the Silverstars of Sel√ªne.
When cast, the elemental legion spell conjured forth four powerful elementals in the area within the casters eyesight. The four elementals were representatives of all four elemental planes. They were always furious powers of destruction, hostile to everyone, even their summoner, unless the caster was protected by the protection from evil spell. After being summoned, the four elementals were dismissed in two and a half minutes, or longer, if cast by a druid or a Silverstar or a truly epic power.
