'''''Glorious transmutation''''' was a powerful [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to permanently turn either [[iron]] into [[silver]] or lead into [[gold]] as chosen by the caster.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a ''[[philosopher's stone]]'' to cast. The stone was alchemically combined with the metal at the time of casting. A new stone was needed the next time the wizard wished to cast the spell. For the spell to work the caster needed to know the formula for mixing the ''philosopher's stone'' with the metal. The amount of material transformed depended on the quality of the ''philosopher's stone''.
