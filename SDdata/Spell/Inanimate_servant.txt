Inanimate servant was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
Using this spell, a shugenja transformed an object into servants. The servant was able to move, follow commands, and work independently. They moved with whatever form of locomotion was appropriate. These servants were imbued with intelligence and performed tasks of great strength, proficiency and skill, but they could not fight on behalf of the shugenja. Friendly shugenja often cast this spell to aid a village in harvesting their crops, make repairs to infrastructure, or help construct a new building.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell and its reverse required a material component a small puppet made of straw for each servant.
