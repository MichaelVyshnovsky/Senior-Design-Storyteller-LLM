        "mainbody": "'''Blade barrier''' was an [[evocation]] spell that summoned a wall of spinning, razor-sharp blades of force.",
        "Effects": "Older versions of this spell created a deadly curtain that could be as small as 5 ft (1.5 m) square or as large as 60 ft (18.3 m) square. Newer versions capped the height at 20 ft (6.1 m) and the shape could be a straight wall or a circular barrier whose length or radius was dependent on the caster's level.\n\nAny creature passing through the wall was harmed, although nimble creatures could avoid some of the blades from the newer version of the spell. If cast in an area already occupied, those quick enough could avoid the wall as it formed and be safely on whichever side they chose.\n\nThe barrier not only kept opponents at bay, but also provided some cover from ranged attacks that passed through it.\n\nAfter the Sundering the spell changed to cover more area in ether a wall or a ringed wall. The straight wall could stretch 100 feet long (30,48 meters), 20 feet high (6.096 meters) and 5 feet thick (1.524 meters). The round wall could have up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high and also 5 feet think.",
        "Components": "Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were necessary to cast this spell."
