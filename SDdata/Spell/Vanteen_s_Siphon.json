The spells magics became activated when offensive magic was discharged, such as casting a fire spell. Once active, Vanteens Siphon started drawing energies from the offensive spellcaster, leaving them weak and shivering on the floor, powerless to continue casting destructive incantations.\nCirca the , a merchant wizard from Neverwinter, and a companion of the Kalach-Cha, Sand, used Vanteens Siphon to protect his shop in the Docks District from magical aggression. Another companion of the Kalach-Cha, a temperamental sorceress named Qara, threatened to burn down Sands shop, but was warned against it under a threat of unleashing the Vanteens Siphon."
