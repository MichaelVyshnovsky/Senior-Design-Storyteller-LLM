'''''Stainless''''' was a [[forge chant]] employed in the making of [[blueshine]] items by [[dwarves]].

==Effects==
The chant modified an item made of metal to render it completely immune to rust, corrosion, acid, and decay. Even [[drow]] equipment gained greater resistance to sunlight when so treated. This chant was a prerequisite for the standard [[blueshine]] application around {{yearlink|1367}}.

==Components==
Besides the chanting common to all [[forge chant]]s, it required a mass of [[platinum]] identical to that of the object to protect.
