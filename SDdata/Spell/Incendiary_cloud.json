        "Effects": "Prior to the [[Time of Troubles]], for [[Parwyyd Hanifar]] at least, an ''incendiary cloud'' spell evoked a cloud around 20 ft (6.0 m) to a side and 10 ft (3.0 m) high, and it billowed outwards in all directions. After 90 seconds, it caught fire, and after another two minutes it turned to blinding fog.{{Cite comic/The Ostus Legacy}}\n\nAfter the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], an ''incendiary cloud'' spell created a cloud of billowing smoke containing hot embers that obscured sight, similar to a ''[[fog cloud]]''. The embers had the potential to burn anyone in the cloud. The cloud was 40 ft (12.1 m) wide and 20 ft (6.0 m) high. The cloud spread slowly out from the point at which it was cast, and the caster had the option to move its point of origin by up to 60 ft (18.3 meters) at a time. The smoke was dispersed by wind, and the spell could not be cast underwater.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Primidon]] in {{Yearlink|-1947}} and was originally called ''Primidon's cloud''.\n\nIn the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], Parwyyd's tower was under siege. His personal assistant Dunstanny suggested that Parwyyd employ an ''incendiary cloud'' spell, which quickly drove the attackers off.\n\nAt latest by [[1374 DR]], the [[church of Kossuth]] managed to convert the spell into one their [[cleric]]s could cast, provided they were introduced in their faith's secret."
