The range of this spell was {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} from the caster<ref group=\"note\">The original description of this spell in [[Dragon magazine 60|''Dragon'' #60]] used the 1{{st}}-edition nomenclature <code>1\"</code>, meaning {{SI|10|ft}} indoors and {{SI|10|yd}} outdoors. This was simplified to the shorter range in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. and the noise could appear to come from behind, under, or inside other things. All creatures in close proximity that could be expected to hear the sound had a chance to resist the spell. If successful, they not aware of the illusion.",
