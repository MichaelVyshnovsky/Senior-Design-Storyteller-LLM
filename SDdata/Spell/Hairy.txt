'''''Hairy''''' was a reversed [[cantrip]] that [[wizard]]s-in-training could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It promoted the growth of hair, fur, or other natural hair-like substances. The reverse of this spell was '''''shorten growth''''', a useful cantrip that reduced and/or inhibited the growth of those same substances.

==Effects==
This cantrip had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and could affect one  head of hair, one beard, one small creature (such as a [[cat]] or [[dog]]), or one object with hair-like fuzz (such as a [[peach]]). The target material became fuller and longer by {{SIrange|2|12|in|c|long=yes}}, permanently. The excess growth could be trimmed, but applying ''shorten growth'' did not necessarily exactly reverse ''hairy''.

This cantrip was most often used as a prank, but ''shorten growth'' was somewhat useful for trimming. If applied to hair-like material less than {{SI|1|in|c|long=yes}} long, it gave a clean shave that lasted for 2 to 12 days.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. For ''shorten growth'', the caster imitated the sound of scissors cutting hair and pantomimed using two fingers as scissors. ''Hairy'' used the same verbal component but the somatic gesture was pantomiming massaging with the fingertips.

==Notable Users==
[[Khelben Arunsun]] occasionally cast ''hairy'' to give [[Shalar Simgulphin]] a genuine red beard.
