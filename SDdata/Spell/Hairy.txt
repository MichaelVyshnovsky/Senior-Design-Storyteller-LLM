Hairy was a reversed cantrip that wizards-in-training could learn. It promoted the growth of hair, fur, or other natural hair-like substances. The reverse of this spell was shorten growth, a useful cantrip that reduced and/or inhibited the growth of those same substances.
This cantrip had a range of  and could affect one  head of hair, one beard, one small creature (such as a cat or dog), or one object with hair-like fuzz (such as a peach). The target material became fuller and longer by , permanently. The excess growth could be trimmed, but applying shorten growth did not necessarily exactly reverse hairy.
This cantrip was most often used as a prank, but shorten growth was somewhat useful for trimming. If applied to hair-like material less than  long, it gave a clean shave that lasted for 2 to 12 days.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. For shorten growth, the caster imitated the sound of scissors cutting hair and pantomimed using two fingers as scissors. Hairy used the same verbal component but the somatic gesture was pantomiming massaging with the fingertips.
Khelben Arunsun occasionally cast hairy to give Shalar Simgulphin a genuine red beard.
