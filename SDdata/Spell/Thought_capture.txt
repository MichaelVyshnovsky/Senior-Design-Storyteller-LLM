Thought capture was a divine divination spell from the thought sphere that allowed the caster to grab the lost thoughts of others.
A casting priest was able to grab temporarily forgotten thoughts from others via thought capture, making the priests brain a magnet for such thoughts. Only a single thought could be grabbed per casting.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
The Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the Mystran faith, could cast the thought capture spell.
