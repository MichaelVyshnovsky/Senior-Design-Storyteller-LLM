'''''Spell invulnerability''''', also known as '''''invulnerability to spells''''', was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] spell that rendered the recipient completely immune to one spell, spell-like ability, or magic item for a short time.

==Effects==
This spell took ten minutes to cast and worked against only one spell, spell-like ability, or magic item that was specified as part of the casting. The invulnerability lasted 18 minutes, or longer for more experienced casters. Only one ''spell invulnerability'' at a time could be active on a creature.

When casting this spell, the caster had to be specific about the spell from which he or she would bestow immunity. For example, the caster had to distinguish between the arcane or [[divine magic|divine]] version of the ''[[light]]'' spell. Once invulnerability was granted, that spell, item, or effect ceased to exist for the recipient for the duration of ''spell invulnerability''. If it was the ''light'' spell just mentioned, the immune individual could not be blinded by a ''light'' being cast in front of his or her eyes, but also could not see anything illuminated solely by ''light''. Being rendered immune to a [[beholder]]'s ''[[flesh to stone]]'' eye did not protect against the beholder's other eyes, nor from the bite of a [[cockatrice]], nor from a ''flesh to stone'' cast by another wizard. For magic items, being immune to all ''swords +1'' meant exactly that&mdash;those swords would pass through the recipient as if they did not exist&mdash;but a ''sword +1, +4 vs. reptiles'' could hit the recipient normally.

Spell scrolls were considered spells and not items for the purposes of ''spell invulnerability''. Unique items, such as [[artifact]]s, [[relic]]s, or the [[Baneblades of Demron]] for example, could not be affected by this spell. Likewise for magical creatures such as [[golem]]s or creatures from other [[planes of existence]].

==Components==
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.

==History==
''Spell invulnerability'' was considered a masterwork among abjurers and was believed to have been developed by [[Caddelyn]] in response to the [[transmuter]]'s ''[[spellstrike]]''. It was first found in the unfinished ''[[Caddelyn's Workbook]]'' by [[Dabron Sashenstar]], who copied it down before the book was lost. although it was rare to find it.
