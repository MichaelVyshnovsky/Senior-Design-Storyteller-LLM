Evards black tentacles, or simply black tentacles, was a conjuration spell that conjured tentacles to grapple and restrain opponents. It was presumably developed by Evard.
This spell conjured many  rubbery black tentacles that erupted from flat surfaces and grabbed, grappled, and crushed everything in a  diameter circular area for a brief time according to the power of the caster. In a later version, the tentacles would try to restrain anything that entered or stayed in a  square area, and caused bludgeoning damage, for up to a minute.
The area that was covered by the tentacles would be difficult for creatures to traverse.
Verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell, as well as a piece of a tentacle from a giant octopus or squid as a material component.
Evards black tentacles was apparently unknown to the Netherese it was not recorded as being known to them.
The Evards black tentacles spell was once kept in the great library of Candlekeep, until it was stolen by Eldrus Wands, a wizard and Magister from 409 DR to 516 DR. He made many copies and, in the guise of a poor and simple former adventurer, sold scrolls of it across Faerûn for mere handfuls of copper pieces.
In the mid–14 century DR, Evards black tentacles was still a rare spell in the Realms.
By the , the Halruaan mage Daltim Flamefist had developed a variant, Daltims fiery tentacles, simply adding blue-white flame to the black tentacles. Kyristan instead formed the tentacles of life-draining negative energy, developing Kyristans malevolent tentacles.
The following mages knew Evards black tentacles
* Thebadol, a Halruaan elder in 1373 DR.
* Pharaun Mizzrym, a Menzoberranyr drow wizard.
* Kyriani Agrivar, a half-drow wizard of Waterdeep.
