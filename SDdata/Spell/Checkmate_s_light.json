        "mainbody": "Checkmates light was a divine evocation spell that temporarily imparted an enchantment upon a touched weapon.\nThe touched weapon glowed with a soothing red color and hummed slightly. The light given off by the weapon could be used like a torch. Any allies within sight of the red glow also enjoyed a boost to their morale. The enchantment placed upon the weapon made it easier for the wielder to strike and harm opponents during combat. The degree of this enchantment was based upon the casters skill. \nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nCheckmates light was found within a spellbook from the Church of the Red Knight called Master Tactician."
