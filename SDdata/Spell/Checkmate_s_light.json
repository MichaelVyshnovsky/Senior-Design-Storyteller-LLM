        "mainbody": "'''''Checkmate's light''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] that temporarily imparted an [[enchantment]] upon a touched weapon.",
        "Effects": "The touched weapon glowed with a soothing red color and hummed slightly. The light given off by the weapon could be used like a torch. Any allies within sight of the red glow also enjoyed a boost to their morale. The enchantment placed upon the weapon made it easier for the wielder to strike and harm opponents during combat. The degree of this enchantment was based upon the caster's skill.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.",
        "History": "''Checkmate's light'' was found within a [[spellbook]] from the [[Church of the Red Knight]] called ''[[Master Tactician]]''.{{Cite web/Master Tactician}}"
