Patternweave was a wild magic abjuration spell used by wild mages.
This spell allowed the caster to make sense of chaos, mainly by following a theme of allowing the caster to see the "whole" while examining just the parts. After casting the spell the caster needed to examine tangible objects, forming a pattern of the objects relationship to each other. If the objects were not related in this manner then the spell would fail.
After seeing the pattern the caster could attempt to reorganize the parts into their original form. This spell was most useful when attempting to reform destroyed objects such as maps.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small hand lens to cast.
