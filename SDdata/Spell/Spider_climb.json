        "mainbody": "Spider climb, sometimes known as spiderwalk or spider scuttle, was a transmutation spell used by sorcerers, warlocks, wizards and some druids. It was also an invocation used by some warlocks, particularly those of the dark pact.\nWhen cast, spider climb allowed its caster to walk along the walls of a cavern like a spider, giving them shadowy legs that allowed them to move with unnatural ease and speed. Spider scuttle was a somewhat complex spell, but warlocks required only a short rest between castings in order to regain the power necessary to cast it again.\nPrior to the Spellplague and after the Second Sundering, spider scuttle was more commonly known as spider climb, and was usable by wizards and sorcerers as well as warlocks. For the former two, spider climb was like any other spell, the number of castings allowed dependent upon a degree of preparation by the wizard or power of the sorcerer. Druids also used a similar evocation.\nThe duration of the spell could be doubled by consuming a potion made from powdered datchas.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic and material components. The materials required were a drop of bitumen and a live spider,\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Quantoul in  and was originally called Quantouls climber."
