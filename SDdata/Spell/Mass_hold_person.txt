Mass hold person was a spell used by sorcerers and wizards. It was a more powerful version of hold person.
This spell functioned in the same manner as hold person, except that it could be used against several creatures at once. The creatures had to be within  of each other.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required an arcane focus, a piece of straight iron.
