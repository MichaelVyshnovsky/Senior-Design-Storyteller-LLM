        "mainbody": "Lightning arrow was a spell used by rangers.\nThis spell turned a weapon into a bolt of lightning. It only functioned with a ranged weapon, either the missile of one, such as an arrow, or the weapon itself, such as a throwing axe. When the spell expired, the weapon returned to its normal state. When the weapon struck a target, every creature within 10 feet (3 meters) suffered electrical damage.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components."
