The spell unleashed a violent blast of psionic energy that hit up to ten creatures within a range of . Even creatures with a moderate animal intelligence were susceptible to this effect. In addition to the traumatic damage, the spell also rendered those who could not resist its effect stunned and unable to act for several seconds.

The spell only required a somatic component.
