'''''Chant''''' was a [[conjuration]] spell that provided a ''[[bless]]'' on the caster's allies and a ''[[curse (spell)|curse]]'' on the caster's enemies for as long as the chant could be maintained without interruption. The [[Arcane magic|arcane]] version of this spell was identical, except it was an [[enchantment]] spell.

==Effects==
Allies were filled with hope, boosting their morale and improving their combat ability, giving them a slightly better chance to strike a blow or aim true. Simultaneously, the caster's enemies were filled with trepidations and doubt, lowering their morale and dulling their combat ability. The caster had to remain stationary and not be interrupted for the ''chant'' to be effective. Any successful attack, ''[[Silence, 15' radius|silence]]'', or movement would break the spell.

The newer version of this spell doubled in effectiveness when another priest of the same religion cast ''[[Prayer (spell)|prayer]]''. It also lasted as long as the caster could keep up the chant. The older version expired after 10 minutes and did not combine with ''prayer''.

==Components==
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. The verbal component was the chant itself.The arcane version of this spell required a musical instrument as a [[Material component]].
