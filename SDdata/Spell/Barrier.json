        "Effects": "The barrier was a magical wall that surrounded the caster with a radius of 10 ft (3 m). The wall would protect the caster against physical or magical attacks until the spell expired. The caster could not cast any spells that inflicted damage, or launch any physical attacks, through the wall.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]]. A piece of [[jade]] or [[amethyst]], worth at least 50 [[gp]], was needed and would be consumed in the casting of the spell."
