The '''''dispel magic field''''' was a spell used against [[Tsjancy Yildree]] during his time as the [[Magister]].

==Effects==
This variant of ''[[dispel magic]]'' created a field of similar effects to it, but which instead "waited", and could not be removed with anything less than a ''[[limited wish]]''.Presumably, the spell unleashed the effect whenever it encountered certain magic in range. It is assumed to be an abjuration spell for the purposes of this wiki. Its range, however, was limited.

==History==
The spell was used to disable ''[[Tsjancy Yildree]]'', and then to keep him captive in a cell. The [[Magister]] finally bypassed the spell by severing the hand trapped in the manacle that kept him in place, then staggering out of the spell's range.
