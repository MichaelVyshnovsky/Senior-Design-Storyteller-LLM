        "mainbody": "Stone shatter was a sonic evocation spell used by bards.\nWith this spell a bard could shatter a stone object or creature with a single well-placed note of perfect pitch. The size of the target that could be affected by this spell depended on the bards skill level. Flying stone from the shattering effect could harm those standing nearby.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
