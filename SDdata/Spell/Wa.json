        "Climate": "The ocean currents of the [[Celestial Sea]] were relatively warm, which led to mild temperatures on the islands of Wa.",
        "Government": "Wa was a feudal military dictatorship with an honorary emperor who held little power. Real power was in the hands of the [[shogun]], the supreme military leader, who ruled over a group of [[daimyo]]. Each daimyo, in turn, controlled a fiefdom, and they had ultimate control over the laws of their fiefs and over the people living there. The shogun had the power to give or remove land and the power to establish or expel daimyos from power but rarely became involved in such matters unless to protect the power of the shogun's family. In turn, the daimyos were sworn to provide soldiers for the shogun's army.\n\nThe shogun of Wa was always chosen from the [[Hidetomi]] clan.''[[Oriental Adventures]]'', the sourcebook that introduced Wa, claimed that the shogun was always chosen from the [[Hidetomi]] clan. However, all other sourcebooks about Wa go into detail about the shogun coming from the [[Matasuuri]] clan, whose founder unified the nation. Perhaps the Hidetomi clan was the family of the shogun before the time of unification or perhaps this is simply an oversight or a retcon.\n\nThe laws in the nation of Wa were far more rigid than those found in neighboring Kozakura, and the social institutions were more complex. Ethically and religiously, the two nations were very similar in outlook.\n\nWa maintained a rigid borders and strictly controlled travel into and out of the country.",
        "Trade": "In [[1372 DR|Wa Year 1790 (1372 DR)]], Wa exported spices that made their way all the way to [[Faerûn]]. The goods came first to [[Shou Lung]] and were then carried overland along the [[Golden Way]], which crossed through the [[Endless Wastes]], [[Rashemen]], and [[Thesk]] to reach the [[Inner Sea]] at [[Telflamm]].",
        "Society": {
            "Classes": "The role of the [[samurai]] was greatly praised in the nation of Wa, more so than in many other Kara-Turran lands. Every daimyo possessed a house of loyal samurai who were paid in [[rice]].\n\nOther social classes in Wa included the merchants, the craftsmen, and the peasants.  Members of different social classes did not mix and were even housed within different wards of Wa cities.",
            "Language": "The people of Wa and Kozakura spoke essentially the same language but different dialects.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} and was about 65% comprehensible by speakers of the [[Kozakuran language|Kozakuran dialect]].",
            "Architecture": "[[File:Kara-Turan Castle.png|thumb|right|250px|''A typical multi-storied castle.'']]\nMost buildings in Wa were constructed from [[clay]] or wood; stone was avoided because of the ever-present threat of earthquakes. Structures were erected atop wooden beams or posts, elevated off the ground, to avoid damage from flooding. Walls were usually very thin, sometimes even made of heavy paper. Wooden walls sometimes had intricately carved nooks called ''[[tokonoma]]'' for displaying artistic ornamentation. The floors were often covered with woven ''[[tatami]]'' mats. More expensive structures had tiled roofs with ridges that reached to the corners of the building. These were often supported by a central pole. Narrow elevated walkways often extended from buildings to connect to gardens or other structures.\n\nPeasants often lived in buildings called ''[[minka]]''. These were single-story structures divided into multiple rooms. These houses often contained a non-elevated portion where the floor was simply the dirt below; this was called the ''[[doma]]''. The rooms were typically placed around the ''doma'' and divided off with ''[[shoji]]'' screens. The ''shoji'' sometimes served as decorations, as did woodblock prints. The outside yards often included beautiful gardens.\n\nThe castles of the lords were often as tall as six stories and were composed of separate structures. The central structure, or donjon, was usually surrounded by four smaller buildings, all of which were connected by corridors, called ''[[watariyagura]]'', topped with turrets, called ''[[yagura]]''. A series of high, stone, gated walls, moats, and compounds of further buildings surrounded the central part of the castle in layers, assuring that conquering the donjon was a near impossible feat.\n\nWanese cities were similarly built in walled layers. The high walls divided the city into several districts. To cross from one ditrict into another, one had to pass through gaurded gates. The streets were typically narrow and crowded and packed with merchants selling their wares. Samurai mansions and compounds were found within the cities as well, but these complexes, while impressive in their own rights, were not as large nor as magnificent as the castles of the daimyos who ruled from province head cities.",
            "Religion": "The nation of Wa contained over 75,000 temples and shrines. Most of these were dedicated to the [[Path of Enlightenment]].\n[[File:Shining Temple of Bishamon.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]], one of thousands of temples or shrines in Wa.'']] \nWa had no official state religion; however, in practice, the shogun only sanctioned the Path and tolerated the other religions. He openly opposed some, especially the worship of the goddess [[Chantea]], which he made illegal and punishable by execution, as her worship originated from Faerûn. The faith was supposedly erradicated after the [[Juzimura rebellion]] in {{YearlinkConvert|1755|WY}}, but in truth it survived in some of the more remote areas of the country.\n\nThe oldest religion practiced in Wa was actually the [[Faith of the Nine Travelers]]. While its views that even the lowliest man could rise to even the height of emperor was considered offensive to the upper classes, this faith was still tolerated by the shogunate.\n\nMany sects also worshiped the [[Eight Million Gods]]. Among these many [[spirit]]s were the four guardian gods of Wa. There was one for each point on the compass, and they were named (moving clockwise from north to west) [[Bishamon|Bishamon the Wide Hearing]], [[Jikoku]], [[Zocho|Zocho the Watch of the Lands]], and [[Komoku|Komoku the Wide Gazing]]. Of these, Bishamon was by far the most popular spirit.\n\nMany holy days and festivals were held throughout the calendar year, some of which were local celebrations special to a region or city.  For example, in [[Nakamura]], where General [[Yoshibei]] was numbered among the Eight Million, his victory was celebrated on the first of [[Chu]] each year. was celebrated on the first of [[Kao]]."

        "Inhabitants": "The people living on Wa were ethnically distinct from those living on the mainland of [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "History": {
            "Mythological Eras": "The history of Wa was said to have begun in the first year of Chisho with the presentation of the [[Sacred Wand]] and the [[Moonlight Arrow]] to [[Kochi]], Master of the Peach Tree, the first emperor of Wa, from the [[Spirit of Wa]]. These sacred items became the emblems of the nation and allowed Kochi to rule over the entire island.\n\nEmperor Kochi supposedly lived and reigned until his 412{{th}} year as ruler. Upon his death, a great war erupted, called the [[War of the Spirits]], a civil war. The spirits of the land fought against the [[human]]s. The [[spirit folk]] of Wa were split; half of them joined with the spirits of the land, while the other half allied with the humans. The [[korobokuru]] began the war as a neutral party but later turned to join the spirits. [[Hengeyokai]] happily fought for both sides of the epic conflict. The War of the Spirits divided the island once unified under Kochi into numerous warring, petty clans.\n\nThe era of Koyo was started with the ascension of Emperor [[Kasada]] to finally unite the nation again. Kasada obtained the Moonlight Arrow from the Spirit of [[Yakamashi Mountain]] and was supported by the korobokuru of the south against those of the north. The second emperor of Wa refused to name the era after himself out of superstitious fear, calling it the era of Koyo instead.\n\nThe final named era of the time predating the Goshukaras was called the era of Kuni. It was perhaps most known as the time of the legendary wandering [[shukenja]] [[Samon]], who was remembered for having accidentally married a great serpent in the era's 23{{rd}} year, during the reign of Emperor [[Nagazane]]. Wa was still ruled by the Kasada dynasty of Koyo during this time.The events of [[Samon]]'s unfortunate marriage are said in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' to have occurred nearly 2,000 years before the current time. The current time for that sourcebook is Wa year 1777, placing the era of [[Kuni]] roughly two centuries before the beginning of the [[Wa calendar]].",
            "Modern History": "Following the [[Spellplague]] of {{YearlinkConvert|1803|WY}}, [[gargantua]]s overwhelmed Wa and left the land devastated. Amongst the consequences, [[hengeyokai]] fled the country and migrated across the sea to [[Sheng Ti]] province, via the port of [[Lo'Shan]]. Although hengeyokai across Kara-Tur saw Sheng Ti as a sanctuary, the Wanese hengeyokai found difficulties assimilating and many had continued west into the [[Hordelands]] and even [[Faerûn]] by {{YearlinkConvert|1897|WY}}.{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|2}}"
