        "mainbody": "'''''Cone of earth''''' was an [[evocation]] and [[Elemental earth school|elemental earth]] [[spell]] from [[Zakhara]]'s ancient empire of [[Kadar]].",
        "Effects": "As the name said, this spell invoked a cone of earth that shot away from the caster, hurting and possibly burying its intended victim. It only functioned if the wizard was standing on earthy ground.",
        "Components": "Aside from [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, ''cone of earth'' required a small amount of [[Pyrite|fool's gold]] as a [[material component]].",
        "History": "The spell ''cone of earth'' was employed by the [[geomancers]] of the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdom]] of Kadar in eastern Zakhara. It was contained in the [[Kitab al-Asfr]], the spellbook penned by the geomancer [[Balshareska]], shortly before she achieved her goal to become Tisan, greatest (and last) holder of power within Kadar.\n\nWith the fall of the geomancers and the centuries-long imprisonment of Tisan, the spell was also lost. After her second defeat in [[1367 DR]],{{AQ-time}} the Kitab al-Asafr and the magic within began circulating again in the Land of Fate."
