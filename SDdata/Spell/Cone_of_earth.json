        "mainbody": "Cone of earth was an evocation and elemental earth spell from Zakharas ancient empire of Kadar.\nAs the name said, this spell invoked a cone of earth that shot away from the caster, hurting and possibly burying its intended victim. It only functioned if the wizard was standing on earthy ground.\nAside from verbal and somatic components, cone of earth required a small amount of fools gold as a material component.\nThe spell cone of earth was employed by the geomancers of the Ruined Kingdom of Kadar in eastern Zakhara. It was contained in the Kitab al-Asfr, the spellbook penned by the geomancer Balshareska, shortly before she achieved her goal to become Tisan, greatest (and last) holder of power within Kadar.\nWith the fall of the geomancers and the centuries-long imprisonment of Tisan, the spell was also lost. After her second defeat in 1367 DR, the Kitab al-Asafr and the magic within began circulating again in the Land of Fate."
