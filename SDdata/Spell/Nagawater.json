        "Geography": "[[File:Nagawater water nagas.jpg|thumb|''Nagawater's [[water naga]]s.''|275x275px]]\nThe [[Naga Plains]] occupied the lands between the [[Golden Plains]] and the Nagawater. West of the Nagawater laid the [[Serpents' Holding]], a band of plains inhabited by nomads, nagas, and [[spitting snake]]s. The northern parts of the lake laid in the region known as the [[Nagalands]].\n\nThe [[Nagaflow]] river fed Nagawater, bringing waters from the depths of the [[Chondalwood]]. The Nagawater was connected to the [[Deepwash]] lake and eventually with the Vilhon Reach via the [[Wintercloak River]].",
        "Flora & Fauna": "The lake is inhabited by a community of [[Water naga|water]] and [[guardian naga]]s, giving its name justice. The naga community was affiliated with the [[Order of the Grand Snakemaster]] and advised by the order's Elder Serpent [[Ashassae]], who offered an invaluable but corrupt council in attempts to sway the community to [[Set]] worship.{{Cite dragon/313/Faiths of Faerun: Elder Serpents of Set|87-88}} The nagas also had an agreement with the humans of [[Ormpetarr]], who left the serpent creatures in peace to their part of the lake, in exchange for the nagas filling the city's [[net]]s with ample lake fish. Nagas of the Nagalands lacked official government. By the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[banelar naga]]s started joining the naga community of the Nagawater, and their number continued to grow steadily. The upper reaches of Nagaflow were used by the region nagas as a spawning ground.\n\nThe western banks of the lake were the home of [[mlarraun]], also known as \"spitting snakes.\"",
        "History": "[[File:Ormpetarr.jpg|thumb|right|''Ormpetarr and surrounding environs circa [[1479 DR]].''|335x335px]]\nIn the century that followed the calamity of the ''[[Spellplague]]'', Vilhon Reach was devastated by wild magics, becoming known as the [[Vilhon Wilds]]. By the {{YearlinkName|1393}}, the Nagawaters lake was already consumed by the Vilhon Wilds.{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Spellplague: The Wailing Years}} However, that disastrous change of the landscape was not permanent. With the ''Spellplague's'' end and the goddess of magic [[Mystra]]'s return during the [[Second Sundering]], that started in the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, the lands of Vilhon Reach were restored to [[Toril]], damage done to the world was healed, and wild magics of the [[Plaguewrought Land]] – wiped by the goddess's hand.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200224175103/https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1231995991613673472| title = TheEdVerse on Twitter| accessdate = 27-12-2021| date = 27-12-2021}}",
