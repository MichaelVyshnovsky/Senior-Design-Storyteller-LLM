West of the Nagawater laid the Serpents Holding, a band of plains inhabited by nomads, nagas, and spitting snakes. The northern parts of the lake laid in the region known as the Nagalands.\nThe Nagaflow river fed Nagawater, bringing waters from the depths of the Chondalwood. The Nagawater was connected to the Deepwash lake and eventually with the Vilhon Reach via the Wintercloak River.\nThe lake is inhabited by a community of water and guardian nagas, giving its name justice. The naga community was affiliated with the Order of the Grand Snakemaster and advised by the orders Elder Serpent Ashassae, who offered an invaluable but corrupt council in attempts to sway the community to Set worship. The nagas also had an agreement with the humans of Ormpetarr, who left the serpent creatures in peace to their part of the lake, in exchange for the nagas filling the citys nets with ample lake fish. Nagas of the Nagalands lacked official government. By the late-14 century DR, banelar nagas started joining the naga community of the Nagawater, and their number continued to grow steadily. The upper reaches of Nagaflow were used by the region nagas as a spawning ground.\nThe western banks of the lake were the home of mlarraun, also known as \"spitting snakes.\"\nthumb|right|Ormpetarr and surrounding environs circa 335x335px\nIn the century that followed the calamity of the Spellplague, Vilhon Reach was devastated by wild magics, becoming known as the Vilhon Wilds.
