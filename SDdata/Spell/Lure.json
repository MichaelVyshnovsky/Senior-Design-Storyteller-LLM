        "mainbody": "Lure was a divine necromancy spell that temporarily transformed a single feature of a persons face or body. It was regularly used by the Sunite clergy to make themselves more attractive.\nBy casting this spell, the cleric could transform a single feature of their body to match that of another being. They could confer upon themself the eyes of a beast, alter their hand to become a claw or talon, or make similar physical changes. These effects lasted for a matter of hours, depending on the power of the caster.\nWhile the spell always worked if a cleric targeted themself, there was a chance it could fail if cast upon someone else.\nMultiple castings of lure could be cast on the same individual. All of these effects could be removed by a single casting of dispel magic.\nLure was one of the spells contained within the relic called the Sash of Sune.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a single drop of holy water and a small scrap of skin taken from the caster as a material component."
