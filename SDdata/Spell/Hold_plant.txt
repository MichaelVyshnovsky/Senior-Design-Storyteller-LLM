Hold plant was an enchantment spell that allowed the caster to prevent dangerous plants from moving or making noise.
All forms of vegetation, including fungi and those magically enhanced, could be affected by this spell (shriekers, treants, shambling mounds, plant growth, spike growth, etc.). However, the more plants in the area of effect, the easier it was for the plants to resist hold plant. Plant life under the effects of this spell could not move, expand, contract, grow, or make a sound under their own volition or magical impetus. However, they were still pliable, not frozen, so wind could still make branches bend and leaves rustle for example. Hold plant could target up to four individual plants in a 40 ft (12.2 m) square, or all small plant growth (grasses, molds, etc.) in a square 4 to 16 yd (3.7 to 14.6 m) on a side.
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. Some druids also required the usual mistletoe.
