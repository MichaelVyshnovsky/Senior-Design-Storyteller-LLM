}}'''''Elemental form''''' was a [[spell]] used commonly in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
The ''elemental form'' spell was available in four different varieties, one for each element. Each variety needed to be memorized separately in order to cast.

This spell enabled the caster to move freely within the environment of the selected element. Additionally, the spell granted martial attacks based upon the element. While in an elemental form, the caster could only be harmed by magical weapons.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small vial of the essence of the appropriate [[elemental]] to cast. These essences could be researched and distilled, or acquired from [[genie]]s through shrewd bargaining.
