        "mainbody": "Scent of vengeance was a divine alteration spell used by specialty priests devoted to Hoar called Doombringers.\nThe spell allowed the caster to easily track a single target that caused offense to another being. The name of the offender was required for the spell to function. It did not work upon undead targets. Once the spell was cast at the exact location of the offense, the priest was able to track the target through any terrain including underwater and through the air. Targets could shake their pursuit by teleporting, using a gate, or shifting to another plane of existence.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a small token once possessed by the quarry and the priests holy symbol to cast."
