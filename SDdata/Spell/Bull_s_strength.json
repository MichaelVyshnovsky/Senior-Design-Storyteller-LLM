        "Effects": "There were at least two versions of this spell, ''bull's strength'' that could be cast by both arcane and divine spellcasters, and ''strength'' which was only used by wizards. whereas the arcane-only ''strength'' lasted for hours.\n\n''Bull's strength'' could be cast by a magical craftsperson on a suit of armour, or a shield. The wearer of this armour would become [[Anchoring|anchored]], making it very difficult for them to move.",
        "Components": "[[File:Bull's Strength 5e.png|thumb|''A spell symbol of bull's strength.'']]\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, ''bull's strength'' required a sample of hair or [[dung]] from a bull. The older ''strength'' spell accepted a similar sample from any strong animal, such as an ape, ox, bear, ''etc.''",
        "History": "This spell was invented by the [[Netherese]] archmage [[Quantoul]] in 1835 NR ({{Yearlink|-2024}}) and was known as '''''Quantoul's strength'''''. After the [[Karsus's Folly|fall]] of the [[Netheril|Netherese empire]], the inventor's name was eventually dropped and it became known as simply ''strength''."
