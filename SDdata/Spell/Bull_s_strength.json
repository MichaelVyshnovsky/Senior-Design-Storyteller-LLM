        "mainbody": "Bulls strength, also known simply as strength,\nThere were at least two versions of this spell, bulls strength that could be cast by both arcane and divine spellcasters, and strength which was only used by wizards. whereas the arcane-only strength lasted for hours.\nBulls strength could be cast by a magical craftsperson on a suit of armour, or a shield. The wearer of this armour would become anchored, making it very difficult for them to move.\nthumb|A spell symbol of bulls strength.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, bulls strength required a sample of hair or dung from a bull. The older strength spell accepted a similar sample from any strong animal, such as an ape, ox, bear, etc.\nThis spell was invented by the Netherese archmage Quantoul in 1835 NR () and was known as Quantouls strength. After the fall of the Netherese empire, the inventors name was eventually dropped and it became known as simply strength."
