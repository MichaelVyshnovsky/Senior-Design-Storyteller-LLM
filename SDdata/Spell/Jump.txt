Jump was a transmutation spell used by young or inexperienced wizards that enhanced the capacity of its target to jump.
When jump was cast on a creature, it became more likely to succeed in any jump.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Yturn in  and was originally called Yturns long jump.
