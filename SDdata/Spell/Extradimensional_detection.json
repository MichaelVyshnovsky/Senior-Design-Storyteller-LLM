        "mainbody": "Extradimensional detection was a divine divination spell from the numbers and divination spheres that detected the presence of any extradimensional pockets.\nThis spell revealed extradimensional pockets within an area measuring  wide by  long. The caster could turn and scan new areas as well. Extradimensional detection could be blocked by solid stone, metal, or wood depending on the thickness.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThe Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the Mystran faith, could cast the extradimensional detection spell."
