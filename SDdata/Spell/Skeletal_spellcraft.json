        "mainbody": "Skeletal spellcraft was a spell used by necromancers.\nThis spell was a more powerful version of empower skeleton. A caster used this spell to allow a skeleton to cast a spell. The skeleton was able to cast a single mid-level spell. The spell was conditional, meaning during casting the caster had to outline specific conditions in which the spell was activated and the skeleton cast its empowered spell. The conditions were literal, so a careless caster might accidentally trigger them. The spell had no expiration years might pass before the conditions were met. Immediately after casting the spell, the caster had to cast the desired spell for the empowerment to take effect. A skeleton was able to hold only a single spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component the ash from a spells scroll. The scroll had to have had at least one active arcane or divine spell.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
