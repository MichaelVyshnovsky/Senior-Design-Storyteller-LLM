Distract was a legerdemain cantrip that acolyte wizards could learn. It allowed the caster to direct the attention of an audience to an area on either side of the caster for a few seconds.
This cantrip was a minor enchantment that drew the focus of all beings that were looking at the caster to a point within  to the left or right of the caster (as viewed by the audience). Youngsters with no experience and folks with low intelligence could not avoid having their gaze drawn to the target area, but everyone else had a chance to resist the spell. If they failed to resist, they were compelled to look at the casters gesturing hand and where it pointed for about six seconds. This presented an opportunity for the wizard to do something else with the other hand that would not be noticed by those affected by distract.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster gestured with one hand to the left or right while speaking a word or phrase intended to grab the audiences attention.
