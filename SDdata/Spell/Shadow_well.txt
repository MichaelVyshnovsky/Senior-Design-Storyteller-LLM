'''''Shadow well''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell caused a targeted creature's shadow to become a temporary gateway to a pocket realm within the [[Plane of Shadow]]. The targeted creature then fell into this pocket realm. Within, it was a desolate place filled with phantasms made from shadow. These phantasms would pursue and mock the creature, but did not cause any physical harm. The only way for a creature to escape the pocket realm was with a ''[[plane shift]]'' spell. Once the spell expired, the targeted creature was returned to the location they were in when the spell was cast, filled with fear and dread.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
