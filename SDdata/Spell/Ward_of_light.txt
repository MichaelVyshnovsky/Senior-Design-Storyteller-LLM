Ward of light was a multi-school divine spell that created an protective force field around the caster.
When this spell was cast, the cleric was surrounded by a stationary field of force energy, that was spherical or hemi-spherical in shape. It had a diameter anywhere from  in length.
Whenever hostile beings entered the area of effect, the ward of light shot a ray of energy at them from the spells material components, which sat in its center. The ward considered anyone not carrying a holy symbol of Lathander as hostile. These rays were exceptionally harmful to the undead.
This spell was inscribed within the holy relic called the Tome of the Morning.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required six tokens made of ivory, inscribed with the symbol of Lathander.
