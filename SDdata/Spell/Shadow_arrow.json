        "mainbody": "Shadow arrow was a necromancy spell that transformed a normal arrow into a missile of pure shadow.\nUpon casting this spell, the arrow was consumed and transmogrified into a bolt of shadow that was shot forth from the caster. Rather than inflict a normal wound, the shadow arrow greatly weakened the person or creature it struck.\nIn addition to a verbal component, the casting of this spell required a single masterwork arrow."
