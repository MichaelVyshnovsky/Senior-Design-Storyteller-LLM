'''''Oilskin''''' was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] spell that protected an individual or an object from precipitation and being doused by waves.

==Effects==
This spell set up a nearly waterproof barrier around one touched creature or small object. The barrier extended one inch (2.5 cm) from the body or the object and prevented all forms of precipitation, including rain, snow, hail, fog, mist, and crashing waves, from dampening the target of the spell. Only immersion in a large body of water could overcome this protection. Once removed from submersion, the spell continued to repel water, but the individual or object was no longer dry. The spell lasted a minimum of 20 minutes and could be extended in 20 minute increments by higher level spellcasters. As an added benefit, eyesight was improved in stormy conditions because the recipient did not have the threat of water getting in his or her eyes.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small piece of cloth that had been treated with oil to be water-repellent.

==History==
This spell was associated with the pirates roaming the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].
