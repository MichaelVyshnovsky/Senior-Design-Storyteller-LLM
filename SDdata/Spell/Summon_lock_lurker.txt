'''''Summon lock lurker''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell given to [[specialty priest]]s and other followers of [[Waukeen]], the Merchants' Friend. It temporarily summoned a small number of [[lock lurker]]s to aid the caster, usually to guard treasure, valuables, or containers that held such items.

==Effects==
When cast, one to three lock lurkers appeared within the next minute and within the 30 ft (9.1 m) range of the spell, at the direction of the caster. The caster could give them simple instructions, but could not understand any communication from the lurkers. They could be set to guard a pile of coins or treasure, placed inside a [[pouch]], chest, bag, or pocket, or left to guard a lock from the other side of a door.

The summoned lock lurkers were fearless and would fight until killed or until the spell expired in eight hours, whichever came first.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components, a gold coin was required to cast this spell, and was consumed in the casting.
