        "mainbody": "Blood link was an arcane necromancy spell that allowed the caster to drain the life force from their target on touch. It was used in conjunction with a permanency or permanency prayer spell in the creation of magic items.\nThe act of casting blood link was considered an evil act, and as such, good- and neutral-aligned spellcasters could lose favor with their deity.  \nThe material components for this spell were a drop of blood, three walnut shell halves and a chain carved from the wood of a zalantar tree."
