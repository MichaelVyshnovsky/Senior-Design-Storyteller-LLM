        "mainbody": "Haunted reverie was a spell used by clerics of Kiaransalee.\nThe target of this spell was a single elf. Once cast, the spells effects did not begin until the next time the targeted elf entered into the reverie. Instead of entering the meditative and refreshing state of the normal reverie, the unfortunate elf instead entered a horrifying and nightmarish version instead. They saw themselves within Kiaransalees layer in the Abyss, Thanatos. Visions of their loved ones and cherished locations were corrupted with visions of decay and undeath. The agony was so great their body flailed about in terrible pain. The longer the elf remained in the haunted reverie, the weaker their psyche became, eventually perishing from the effects of the spell.\nThe victim could escape the cursed reverie through sheer willpower. A powerful spellcaster could awaken them with either a remove curse or a wish spell. The same spells could also be used on an elf who knew they were cursed before entering the reverie. If an elf was unable to escape the haunted reverie and was killed, only a wish spell could rescue them. The natural elven resistance to sleep and charm spells did nothing to protect them from this spell.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components."
