        "mainbody": "Moss skull was a divine evocation spell that conjured a skull-shaped projectile.\nWhen cast, the spell manifested an explosive, moss-covered skull that streaked towards a target person or creature. When it struck, the moss skull detonated in a blast of ice and fire.\nThe projectile could be detonated mid-flight, willed away by the caster or outright destroyed, if it was struck by fire or ice.\nThe specifications of this spell were inscribed within the relic known as the Leaves of Green.\nIn order to be cast, this spell required verbal and somatic components, along with a number of material components a shard of human bone, a pinch of ash from organic material, and an additional piece of bone taken from a dead, frostbitten creature."
