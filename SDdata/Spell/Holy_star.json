        "mainbody": "'''''Holy star''''' was a [[divine]] [[evocation]] spell that conjured brilliant, [[magic]]al mote of light that accompanied the [[cleric]].",
        "Effects": "The casting of this spell caused a bright light to appear over the caster's shoulder. It floated nearby for a matter of seconds, until the duration of the spell expired or all its magical energy was released.\n\nEvery few seconds, the ''holy star'' could be willed by the caster to perform a number of actions. First, it could reflect back the effects of any spell cast nearby, towards its source. Second, the ''holy star'' could completely protect the cleric from any physical or magical attack. Third, it could emit a beam of damaging force energy burned any being it struck.\n\nAfter performing four of these actions, or emitting two beams of energy, the ''holy star'' dissipated.",
        "History": "The specifications of this spell could be displayed by the [[relic]] known as the ''[[Scepter of Mystra]]''.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast."
