'''''Nerve dance''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Halruaa]].

==Effects==
This spell created 1 to 3 red streamers to strike forth from the casters hand. The streamers could strike at one target or get split between several targets. If hit by a streamer, the target was stuck and experience excruciating pain as long as the streamer was attached. 

Target stuck by streamers could not cast spells or perform similar actions. The cast needed to maintain concentration on the streamers for them to remain in contact with the target. Breaking the caster's concentration ended the spell.

==Components==
This spell required a 6-inch strand of red spider silk and a glass rod that has a ''[[continual light]]'' spell cast upon it to cast.
