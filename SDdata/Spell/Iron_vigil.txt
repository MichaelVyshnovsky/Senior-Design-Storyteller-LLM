'''''Iron vigil''''' was an [[alteration]] spell that allowed the caster to forgo food, drink and sleep, and be immune to the effects of normal environmental conditions for a week or even longer.

==Effects==
While under the effects of this spell, the caster required no food or water and felt no ill effects from hunger, thirst, fatigue, dehydration, or the discomforts of exposure to normal climate conditions. Sleep was not necessary, but watchful meditation had to be substituted instead, which made the caster slightly more susceptible to surprise attack.

At the end of the vigil, the caster had to eat and drink or slowly fall into a coma and die. For each day of no food, drink, or sleep, the caster had to rest for at least four hours before engaging in normal activity.

==Components==
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
