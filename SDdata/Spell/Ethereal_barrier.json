        "mainbody": "'''''Ethereal barrier''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that prevented encroachment by creatures moving through the [[Ethereal Plane]].",
        "Effects": "The wall(s) created by this spell were proof against creatures traveling through the [[Ethereal Plane]] by ''phasing'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[shadow walk]]'', or any other method of travel through the Border Ethereal adjacent to the [[plane]] of the caster (usually the [[Prime Material Plane]]). To those on the same plane as the caster, ''ethereal barrier'' was undetectable. This spell did not prevent travel through the [[Astral Plane]] (''[[teleport]]'', ''[[gate]]'', etc.).\n\nThe area of effect was two 10 ft (3.1 m) squares per level of the caster, arranged any way the priest desired. Multiple priests could cooperatively cast this spell for a greater duration, combining their areas of coverage. It took ten minutes to erect an ''ethereal barrier''.",
        "Components": "Besides verbal and somatic components, a compound of lead and rare earths was required. Estimated cost was 10 gp per square.",
