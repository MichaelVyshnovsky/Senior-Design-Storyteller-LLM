Venomdust was a spell that could only be cast by dragons. Dragons often used this spell to protect their treasure hoard.
When cast, the spell created a small mass of dust, about s worth. This dust was incredibly poisonous. The dust was sticky so it could be applied to an object. Exposure to the dust, by touch or ingestion, was usually fatal to a humanoid. The dragon was immune to the dusts toxic effects. The presence of the dust could be detected with a detect magic spell, and can be neutralized with either a dispel magic or neutralize poison spell. The amount of dust created after casting was dependant on the dragons skill level.
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
