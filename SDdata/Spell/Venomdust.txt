'''''Venomdust''''' was a [[spell]] that could only be cast by [[dragon]]s. Dragons often used this spell to protect their treasure hoard.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell created a small mass of dust, about {{SI|1|sq. ft|c}}'s worth. This dust was incredibly poisonous. The dust was sticky so it could be applied to an object. Exposure to the dust, by touch or ingestion, was usually fatal to a humanoid. The dragon was immune to the dust's toxic effects. The presence of the dust could be detected with a ''[[detect magic]]'' spell, and can be neutralized with either a ''[[dispel magic]]'' or ''[[neutralize poison]]'' spell. The amount of dust created after casting was dependant on the dragon's skill level.

==Casting==
The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
