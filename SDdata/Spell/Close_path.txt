Close path was an abjuration spell that temporarily suppressed spell-use in a practitioner of path magic.
A victim of close path could no longer use one of their paths of magic for one day, neither being able to cast spells from this path nor memorize them. Which path was affected was determined by random chance.
In addition to using verbal and somatic components, a small key of silver needed to be snapped during the casting.
Close path, together with the spells seal path and burn path, formed the rarely found Path of Paths, dreaded by followers of path magic as it directly attacked their spellcasting ability.
