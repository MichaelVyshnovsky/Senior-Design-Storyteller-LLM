        "mainbody": "'''''Ego whip''''' was a [[psionic]] power of the [[telepathy]] [[discipline]] that assaulted a foe's ego.",
        "Effects": "This power assailed the ego, confidence, self-esteem, and individuality of a single subject with feelings of their inferiority and worthlessness, or else of the manifester's superiority and megalomania. It rapidly lashed their mind like a glowing whip, its crack cutting open deep-seated feelings of inadequacy. If they lacked the willpower to resist, the victim felt incapable and insignificant. Initially, this left them dazed for up to 4 minutes and unable to perform as well as they once could, and even unable to use all but the lowest [[spell]]s. After the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], they were only dazed for several seconds, but the damage to their confidence was lasting.\n\n''Ego whip'' was originally one of the five attacks of psionic combat and was a way of making forced ''[[contact]]''. but after 1372 DR, ''thought shield'' was the best defense while ''[[tower of iron will]]'' was weakest.",
        "Prerequisite Powers": "It could require ''[[contact]]'' and ''[[mindlink]]'' to learn.",
        "Display": "Manifesting the power produced the standard auditory [[display]].",
        "Significance": "\"Ego Whipper\" was the title of the third rank of the clergy of [[Deep Duerra]], the [[duergar]] goddess of psionics.<ref>",
        "Users": "''Ego whip'' could be learned by [[psionicist]]s and [[psion]]s, as well as by [[wilder]]s.\n\nIt could be known by [[blue (goblinoid)|blue goblins]],<ref> [[crysmal]]s,<ref> adult [[intellect devourer]]s,<ref><ref> [[caller in darkness|callers in darkness]],<ref> [[ikiryo]],<ref> and [[cerebrilith]]s.<ref> \n\nIn psionics terms, it could also be known by [[duergar]], [[aboleth]], [[ki-rin]],<ref><ref> [[mind flayer]]s,<ref> [[titan]]s, and by [[githyanki]] and [[githzerai]],<ref>",
