        "mainbody": "Wildzone was a wild magic conjuration spell used by wild mages.\nThis spell appeared to replicate conditions found in wild magic regions by disrupting magical forces. Though the effects of this spell were temporary, casting this spell in conjunction with a permanency spell could create a permanent wild magic zone.\nThe area effected by this spell was a square measuring  long on each side. The square was centered on the casters position when the spell was cast. Wild magic dominated the wildzone, causing wild surges any time a spell was cast or a magic item discharged. A spell cast outside of the wildzone would function normally.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required several pots of paint and a hammered sheet of silver worth at least 2,000 gp to cast. The paint needed to be poured over the silver sheet during the casting."
