Shadow head was an evocation wizard spell.
When memorized, the caster intertwined this spell with any spell in their repertoire of medium to lower level. The spells combined into a single spell, freeing up space in the casters memory to store another spell.
When cast, shadow head created a spectral translucent head resembling a humans. The caster could make the head appear as any size up to their own height. The caster could move the head and speak with through it at will.
The caster could use the head to issue warning messages or make it function similar to a magic mouth with a message up to 50 words long.
If the shadow head was attacked directly, the spell stored with the head was instantly unleashed at the attacker.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a bit of tongue from any creature and a piece of cobweb once touched by a shadow to cast.
