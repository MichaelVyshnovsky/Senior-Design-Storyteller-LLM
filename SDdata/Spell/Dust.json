        "mainbody": "Dust was a useful cantrip that acolyte wizards could learn. It removed all fine particles and grit from a small area, sending it elsewhere.\nThe target of this spell had to be within  of the caster and only worked on open surfaces within  of the target point. All tiny dust and grit particles on shelves, walls, furniture, floors, etc. within the area of effect were transported to an unknown location. This cantrip could not remove dust-like substances from inside closed containers like a snuff box or a makeup jar.\nThe cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. A hand was waved back and forth while performing a slow inhalation of breath for a few seconds."
