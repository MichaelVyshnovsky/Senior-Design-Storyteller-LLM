        "mainbody": "'''''Wall of stone''''' was a [[conjuration]] or [[evocation]] spell that created a mutable stone wall.",
        "Effect": "As the name suggested, ''wall of stone'' created a wall made of stone. The thickness of this wall increased with the caster's skill. The same applied to the area the wall occupied. This area could even be doubled by halving the thickness.\n\nWhile the spell was called ''wall of stone'', the result did not need to be a wall. At the caster's discretion, the ''wall of stone'' could be turned into practically any shape, as long as the ''wall of stone'' was rooted in existing stone. For example, the ''wall of stone'' could be made to create a [[magic]]al bridge. If the length of this bridge did not exceed {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}}, this bridge did not need to be arched and buttressed.\n\nIt was technically possible to entrap creatures by casting this spell, but it only worked on creatures with slow reflexes.\n\nA ''wall of stone'' could be destroyed by completely mundane means or by means of a ''[[disintegrate]]'' spell.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]] and [[material]] components. The material needed was a small block of granite.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Mavin]] in {{Yearlink|-641}} and was originally called ''Mavin's stonewall''."
