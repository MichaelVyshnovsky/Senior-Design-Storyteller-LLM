'''''Sound bubble''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s and spellcasting [[bard]]s that created a sound barrier around an area of the caster's choosing. It was often used to either enhance a bardic performance's effect and quality or for similar situations as the ''[[silence]]'' spell was used for.

==Effects==
Casting this spell would cause an invisible bubble to be created, either on an area or centered around the caster. In the latter case, the bubble would move with the caster. A stationary bubble had a radius of {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}}, while a mobile bubble had a radius of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}. Any sound made within this bubble was not audible to creatures outside of it and any sounds made outside of the bubble could not be heard by those within it.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, casting this spell required a [[material component]]. This could take the form of either a soap bubble or a blown [[egg]] shell.
