        "mainbody": "Scratch was a person-affecting cantrip that wizards-in-training could learn. It caused a target creature to experience an irritating itch they felt compelled to relieve.\nThis cantrip could target a single creature within  and caused a spot on their body to become irritated, as if they had a rash or had been bitten by an insect. If the target did not resist the spell, they immediately moved to relive the itch by rubbing the spot with their nails, claws, or whatever method was effective for the creature. One second of scratching was all it took to alleviate the discomfort.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster spoke the name of a skin pest (flea, louse, tick, etc.) while pointing to a spot on the target creature."
