        "mainbody": "Lesser guardian hammer was a spell used by clerics of Thard Harr.\nLike guardian hammer, this spell was used to guard an area such as a door. When triggered by a living creature, the spell activated. An invisible field of force in the shape of a large hammer flew towards the closest living creature. While the spell was only capable of triggering once, it did not miss a target. Physical and magical barriers would not stop the hammer from striking a target The creature unlucky enough to be struck by the hammer was knocked over.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, a single hair from any creature, a pebble and the saliva or sweat of the caster."
