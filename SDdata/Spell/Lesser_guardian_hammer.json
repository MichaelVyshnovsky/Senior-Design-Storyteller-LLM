        "mainbody": "'''''Lesser guardian hammer''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Thard Harr]].",
        "Effects": "Like ''[[guardian hammer]]'', this spell was used to guard an area such as a door. When triggered by a living creature, the spell activated. An invisible field of force in the shape of a large hammer flew towards the closest living creature. While the spell was only capable of triggering once, it did not miss a target. Physical and magical barriers would not stop the hammer from striking a target The creature unlucky enough to be struck by the hammer was knocked over.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, a single hair from any creature, a pebble and the saliva or sweat of the caster."
