        "mainbody": "Mass was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThis spell allowed a wu jen to manipulate the weight of an item. The item had to be within 60 yards (54 meters) of the wu jen for the spell to work. Manipulating the mass of an item had no effect on the properties of the item. For example, if a wu jen doubled the mass of an arrow, that arrow could still be fired as a regular arrow. The spell was able to affect multiple items at once. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a hummingbird feather and the toenail of an elephant."
