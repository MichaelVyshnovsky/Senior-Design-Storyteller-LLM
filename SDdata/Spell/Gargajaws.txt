Gargajaws was a powerful, destructive spell capable of causing incredible damage to structures.
Upon casting the spell, a column of white flame rose from the casters cupped palms for . The white flame split in three past that point, each flame forming into a shape akin to the clamlike, eyeless head of a beast these jaws would then attack a target each within . Though they dealt no damage to living matter, they struck inanimate and undead matter with the force of a disintegrate spell, effectively taking a bite out of a  cube.
Were there not enough room for the column to rise to its full height, a single head was created, but its bite could damage a volume spanning twice the usual area in each dimension.
The spell called for verbal and somatic components, but also required a series of material components, including a piece of ferrous material, a stone, and a shard, spar, or long rod of glass.
The elves attacking Mythanthars tower in  employed this spell, amongst others.
