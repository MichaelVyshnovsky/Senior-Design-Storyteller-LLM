Luck was an enchantment spell that increased the luck of a single creature.
The wizard could cast the spell on any other being within 15 feet (4.6 meters). The creature under the effect of the spell would become exceptionally lucky for the following three minutes. As such, the chosen creature would become more likely to hit their target and avoid affects of an attack or spell (such as a higher chance of dodging an arrow or resisting a spell that could paralyze them). As well as this, they would become slightly better in thievery skills, such as pickpocketing and sneaking.
The target of the spell was able to resist some damage from other spells.
