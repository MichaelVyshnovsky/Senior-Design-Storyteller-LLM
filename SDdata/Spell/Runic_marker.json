        "Effects": "When cast, this spell created a pillar of stone, {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} in height and {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. The shape of the pillar was determined by the caster and it had to be a solid structure with no hollow spaces within. The caster could also inscribe a message of up to twenty-five characters upon the pillar.\n\nThe purpose of the stone was the it had a ''[[glyph of warding]]'' upon it. The ''glyph'' was of the blast type. In addition to the normal trigger conditions for a ''glyph of warding'', the caster could also assign a trigger in which the ''glyph'' activated if the pillar received any damage. Once the ''glyph of warding'' was activated, the spell was complete and the pillar of stone destroyed.",
