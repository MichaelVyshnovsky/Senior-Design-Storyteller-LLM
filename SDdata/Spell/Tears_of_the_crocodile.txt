'''''Tears of the crocodile''''' was a [[spell]] that turned freshwater around its caster into saltwater. The reverse form, '''''tears of the alligator''''', would turn saltwater around its caster into freshwater.

==Effects==
This spell was centered on its caster and would alter the water within a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} radius of them. Creatures of an animal intellect that inhabited the water were repelled from its altered counterpart, while more intelligent creatures were capable of entering it, albeit with discomfort.

==Components==
In addition to a [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] component, this spell required a [[material component]] in the form of three [[crocodile]] tears sealed within a hollow [[ceramic]] sphere. The reverse form, ''tears of the alligator'', instead required three [[alligator]] tears sealed within a hollow ceramic sphere.

==Notable Users==
[[Greater sea hag]]s were typically able to cast this spell.<ref>
