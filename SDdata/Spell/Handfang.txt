Handfang was an necromancy/transmutation spell that conjured a fanged mouth within the casters hand.
The serpentine mouth would take the place of the casters hand for at least half a minute. The caster could in effect bite down with the jaws of their snake-like appendage and hold on to them with its fangs until they broke free, or the spells duration finished.
Some time in the early 14 century DR, an apprentice of Halaster created a living spell that was a combination of handfang and magic mouth, known later as the Hand That Sings.
