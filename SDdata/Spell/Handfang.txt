'''Handfang''' was an [[necromancy]]/[[transmutation]] [[spell]] that conjured a fanged mouth within the caster's hand.

==Effects==
The serpentine mouth would take the place of the caster's hand for at least half a minute. The caster could in effect bite down with the jaws of their snake-like appendage and hold on to them with its fangs until they broke free, or the spell's duration finished.

==Notable Users==
Some time in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], an apprentice of [[Halaster]] created a [[living spell]] that was a combination of ''handfang'' and ''[[magic mouth]]'', known later as the [[Hand That Sings]].
