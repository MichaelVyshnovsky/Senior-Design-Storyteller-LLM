'''''Chameleon''''' was a common spell used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]] to change the color of their skin and clothing in a similar manner to the natural ability of [[chameleon]]s. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell camouflaged the target creature. This was done by altering the coloration of the creature to match that of whatever background was behind the creature. If the creature was moving in an area where the background changed gradually, the spell would automatically change the coloration of the creature to match. If the background changed abruptly, the creature was required to wait for the spell to catch up. This spell worked best if the creature was hidden in shadows. From a distance greater than 30 feet (9 meters), the creature was effectively invisible; at closer range, there was a chance they would be seen. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a skin shed from a lizard.
