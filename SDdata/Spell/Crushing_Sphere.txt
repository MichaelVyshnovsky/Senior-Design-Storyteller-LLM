'''''Crushing sphere''''' was a [[spell]] that was first developed by the [[phaerimm]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell caused a sphere of force, somewhat similar to the ''[[Otiluke's resilient sphere]]'' spell, to appear around a targeted created. The sphere constricted around the target and began to shrink. Within the sphere, the targeted creature was immobile, and thus unable to make the somatic gestures required for casting a spell, although they were able to cast a spell that required only verbal components. If the spell was cast on a creature from another plane, said creature was unable to return to it's plane of origin for the duration of the spell. The sphere's interior was lined with pseudo-pods of energy, which attacked the target. Some protective spells such as ''[[barkskin]]'' or ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]'' reduced the amount of damage the targeted creature suffered but did not break the sphere itself. 

The spell was vulnerable to ''[[dispel magic]]'', which instantly removed the sphere from around a targeted creature. If the sphere came into contact with a ''[[wall of force]]'' spell, the sphere consumed the wall, absorbing the force into itself and increasing the duration of the spell. If the sphere came into contact with a ''[[globe of invulnerability]]'' or any kind of prismatic spell, the result was an intense explosion which caused both spells to expire.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components. During casting, the caster made a crushing motion with their hand or equivalent appendage.

==History==
This spell was originally created by the [[Phaerimm]] of [[Myth Drannor]].
