        "mainbody": "Summon lock lurker was a divine magic spell given to specialty priests and other followers of Waukeen, the Merchants Friend. It temporarily summoned a small number of lock lurkers to aid the caster, usually to guard treasure, valuables, or containers that held such items.\nWhen cast, one to three lock lurkers appeared within the next minute and within the 30 ft (9.1 m) range of the spell, at the direction of the caster. The caster could give them simple instructions, but could not understand any communication from the lurkers. They could be set to guard a pile of coins or treasure, placed inside a pouch, chest, bag, or pocket, or left to guard a lock from the other side of a door.\nThe summoned lock lurkers were fearless and would fight until killed or until the spell expired in eight hours, whichever came first.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, a gold coin was required to cast this spell, and was consumed in the casting.\nCategoryEvocation spells\nCategoryWaukeenar spells\nCategoryCleric spells\nCategoryDruid spells\nCategoryMystic spells\nCategoryRanger spells\nCategoryShaman spells\nsvp6dem7qbcpj48baun33dncl7dumhg"
