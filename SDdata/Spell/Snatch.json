        "mainbody": "Snatch was a person-affecting cantrip that neophyte wizards could learn. It acted upon a target creature, briefly tugging on a limb or other body part, possibly causing them to stumble or fumble.\nThis cantrip only worked on small- to medium-sized creatures, had limited effect on large creatures, and no effect on anything bigger. The target creature had to be within a range of .The original description of this cantrip in Dragon #100 gave the range as  for apprentice wizards and  for experienced mages. If the target failed to resist the spell, they experienced a quick, light yanking force at a spot on their body, possibly causing them to drop small items they were trying to manipulate (coins, gems, keys, spell components, etc.), stumble while running, or turn (if a head, shoulder, elbow, or hip were targeted, for example). If the target successfully resisted the cantrip, they were merely delayed for a few moments. Large creatures were only delayed if they did not resist, and were unaffected otherwise.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster curled a finger in a hook shape, visualized the target spot and direction of the force, then gave a quick jerk with the finger while making a hissing sound.\nThis cantrip was invented by Sabirine, a mage who advocated development and improvement of cantrips. Snatch was recorded in the tome known as Sabirines Specular."
