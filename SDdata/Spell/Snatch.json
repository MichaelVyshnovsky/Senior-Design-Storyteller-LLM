        "mainbody": "'''''Snatch''''' was a person-affecting [[cantrip]] that neophyte [[wizard]]s could learn. It acted upon a target creature, briefly tugging on a limb or other body part, possibly causing them to stumble or fumble.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip only worked on small- to medium-sized creatures, had limited effect on large creatures, and no effect on anything bigger. The target creature had to be within a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}.<ref group=\"note\">The original description of this cantrip in [[Dragon magazine 100|''Dragon'' #100]] gave the range as {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} for apprentice wizards and {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}} for experienced mages. If the target failed to resist the spell, they experienced a quick, light yanking force at a spot on their body, possibly causing them to drop small items they were trying to manipulate (coins, gems, keys, spell components, ''etc.''), stumble while running, or turn (if a head, shoulder, elbow, or hip were targeted, for example). If the target successfully resisted the cantrip, they were merely delayed for a few moments. Large creatures were only delayed if they did not resist, and were unaffected otherwise.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster curled a finger in a hook shape, visualized the target spot and direction of the force, then gave a quick jerk with the finger while making a hissing sound.",
        "History": "This cantrip was invented by [[Sabirine]], a mage who advocated development and improvement of cantrips. ''Snatch'' was recorded in the tome known as ''[[Sabirine's Specular]]''."
