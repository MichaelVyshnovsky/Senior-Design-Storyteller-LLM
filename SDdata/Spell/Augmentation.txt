The '''''augmentation''''' group of [[spell]]s were [[evocation]] spells used by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
These spells were used to increase the physical harm caused by beginner to intermediate spells. Each casting would only affect a single spell cast within one minute for ''augmentation I'', but ''augmentation II'' affected the next five spells cast. If more than a minute passed and the follow-up spell was not cast then the ''augmentation'' spell was wasted.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, ''augmentation I'' required a pair of concentric circles made of either [[bronze]] or [[silver]] to cast. For ''augmentation II'' the concentric circles needed to be made of [[gold]] or [[platinum]].
