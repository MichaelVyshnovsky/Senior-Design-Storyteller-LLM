The augmentation group of spells were evocation spells used by wizards.
These spells were used to increase the physical harm caused by beginner to intermediate spells. Each casting would only affect a single spell cast within one minute for augmentation I, but augmentation II affected the next five spells cast. If more than a minute passed and the follow-up spell was not cast then the augmentation spell was wasted.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, augmentation I required a pair of concentric circles made of either bronze or silver to cast. For augmentation II the concentric circles needed to be made of gold or platinum.
