Ice blight was a powerful spell commonly used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
Using this spell, a wu jen was able to summon a mighty blizzard that lasted for several days. Six hours into the first 24 hours, snow began to fall. In a warmer climate, snow would not fall until 36 to 48 hours after the spell was cast. Up to 48 inches (121 centimeters) of snow might fall until the spell expired. Thick clouds formed and the temperature dropped to as low as −20 °F (−29 °C). Strong winds would form large snow drifts and caused visibility to drop to less than 200 feet (60 meters).
Any creature exposed to the spell experienced the same adverse effects of an arctic climate. Without adequate clothing, shelter, or a fire, creatures quickly froze to death. Casting a control weather spell would not stop the spell, but it could make the spells effects less powerful or prolonged.
This spell was very difficult for a wu jen to cast. They had to harness massive amounts of magical energy and when the spell was cast, a massive burst of energy spread through the wu jens body, damaging both their body and soul. This spell also caused the wu jen to forget any spell they had memorized. The wu jen was required to rest after casting.
The reverse of this spell was drought. Drought has the opposite effect of ice blight. It dried the land and raised the temperature up to 120 °F (48 °C). The spell cleared any clouds in the sky and no rain would fall until the spell expired. The spell reduced large rivers into small streams and dried deep wells. The spell could last up to 25 days.
Casting a control weather spell would not stop the spell, but it could make the spells effects less powerful or prolonged. Both this spell and ice blight cancelled each other out.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a piece of ice, while the material component of drought was a small amount of desert sand.
