'''''Haunted reverie''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Kiaransalee]].
 
==Effects==
The target of this spell was a single [[elf]]. Once cast, the spell's effects did not begin until the next time the targeted elf entered into the [[reverie]]. Instead of entering the meditative and refreshing state of the normal reverie, the unfortunate elf instead entered a horrifying and nightmarish version instead. They saw themselves within Kiaransalee's layer in the [[Abyss]], [[Thanatos (layer)|Thanatos]]. Visions of their loved ones and cherished locations were corrupted with visions of decay and undeath. The agony was so great their body flailed about in terrible pain. The longer the elf remained in the ''haunted reverie'', the weaker their psyche became, eventually perishing from the effects of the spell.

The victim could escape the cursed reverie through sheer willpower. A powerful spellcaster could awaken them with either a ''[[remove curse]]'' or a ''[[wish]]'' spell. The same spells could also be used on an elf who knew they were cursed before entering the reverie. If an elf was unable to escape the ''haunted reverie'' and was killed, only a ''wish'' spell could rescue them. The natural elven resistance to sleep and charm spells did nothing to protect them from this spell.

==Components==
This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components.
