Shadow dragon was a spell that could only be cast by dragons. It was a favored spell of shadow dragons.
When cast, this spell transformed a dragon into pure shadow. While transformed, the dragon was still able to use their breath weapon and cast spells. The transformed dragon was able to hide in shadow and became invisible in total darkness.
While transformed into shadow, the dragon was immune to most magical and mundane attacks. The dragon was vulnerable to light-based spells or magical items enchanted with a light-based spell. If exposed to sunlight, the spell expired instantly and the dragon resumed its natural form.
This spell required only a verbal component.
