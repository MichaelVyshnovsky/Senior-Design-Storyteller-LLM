An [[aura]] would also surround buildings to indicate the dominant alignment of the occupants. This spell also revealed unwarded magic.  \n\nThe reverse of the spell, '''''mask''''', hid the aura of a building from detection. The duration of this spell was one week.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
