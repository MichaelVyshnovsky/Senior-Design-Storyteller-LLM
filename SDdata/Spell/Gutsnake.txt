Gutsnake was a spell used by sorcerers and wizards.
When cast, the spell created a large snake-like tentacle from the chest of the caster. It was  long and ended in the eyeless head of a large snake. The caster was able to control the snake. The caster was able to continue casting spells and if a creature struck the snake with a weapon, the caster did not feel it. If damaged too much, the tentacle vanished. The caster was able to direct it to strike a target, either biting or constricting a creature.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a focus, a reptiles tooth.
