'''''Gutsnake''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell created a large snake-like tentacle from the chest of the caster. It was {{SI|15|ft}} long and ended in the eyeless head of a large snake. The caster was able to control the snake. The caster was able to continue casting spells and if a creature struck the snake with a weapon, the caster did not feel it. If damaged too much, the tentacle vanished. The caster was able to direct it to strike a target, either biting or constricting a creature.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a focus, a reptiles tooth.

==History==
[[Azuth]] made this spell available through [[Elminster]] sometime prior to {{yearlink|1370}}.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|101}}
