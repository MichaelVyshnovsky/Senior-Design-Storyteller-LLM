This spell was only usable by wizards.\nWhen cast, this spell created an area of silence that surrounding an item or individual. All sounds that would normally emanate from the target were muffled. This spell did not prevent spellcasting or other activities requiring speech. All sounds that would have come from the target were randomly transported elsewhere.\nThis spell required a two handfuls of sand to cast."
