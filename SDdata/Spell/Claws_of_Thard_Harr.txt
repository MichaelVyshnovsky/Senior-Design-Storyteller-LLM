Claws of Thard Harr was a spell used by clerics of Thard Harr.
When cast on a targeted creature, this spell transformed their hands into sharp talons. The recipient of the spell, who had to be willing, was not able to wield a weapon while the spell was in effect.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the holy symbol of Thard Harr as well as a preserved talon from a wild animal, which was not consumed in the casting.
