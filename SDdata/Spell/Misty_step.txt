'''''Misty step''''' was a [[conjuration]] spell that provided the ability to perform short-range [[teleportation]].

==Effects==
''Misty step'' could be cast very quickly. The spell briefly surrounded the caster with a silvery mist. The caster then teleported to any location in sight within 30 ft (9.1 m).

Some [[humanoid]] races were innately capable of casting ''misty step'' or a similar effect. In particular, the ''[[fey step]]'' ability of the [[eladrin]] allowed them to use their connection to the [[Feywild]] to shorten paths, in a similar way that ''misty step'' did. In fact, a few [[high elf|high elves]] could unlock their innate ability to cast the spell by studying elven lore.

The [[githyanki]] were also capable of innately casting ''misty step'' by channeling their [[psionic]] abilities. They could do so completely silently, with no need for components.

==Components==
The spell only required [[verbal component]]s.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the spell was available for copying for 75 [[gp]] from a selection of [[spellbook]]s at the [[Book Wyrm's Treasure]] bookstore in [[Trollskull Alley]] in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. The owner, [[Rishaal]], also offered the service to scribe the spell onto a [[scroll]] for 150 gp.
