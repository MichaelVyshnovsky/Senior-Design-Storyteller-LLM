Misty step was a conjuration spell that provided the ability to perform short-range teleportation.
Misty step could be cast very quickly. The spell briefly surrounded the caster with a silvery mist. The caster then teleported to any location in sight within 30 ft (9.1 m).
Some humanoid races were innately capable of casting misty step or a similar effect. In particular, the fey step ability of the eladrin allowed them to use their connection to the Feywild to shorten paths, in a similar way that misty step did. In fact, a few high elves could unlock their innate ability to cast the spell by studying elven lore.
The githyanki were also capable of innately casting misty step by channeling their psionic abilities. They could do so completely silently, with no need for components.
The spell only required verbal components.
In the late 15 century DR, the spell was available for copying for 75 gp from a selection of spellbooks at the Book Wyrms Treasure bookstore in Trollskull Alley in the North Ward of Waterdeep. The owner, Rishaal, also offered the service to scribe the spell onto a scroll for 150 gp.
