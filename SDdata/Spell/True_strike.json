        "mainbody": "True strike was a divination spell that allowed the caster to look a few seconds into the future and gain a great advantage to hit a target.\nThis spell allowed the caster to look one move ahead and strike at the right place at the right time, with almost guaranteed success. This knowledge even negated the concealment of targets. The divination only revealed a few seconds into the future, so any hesitation to act on this knowledge was a lost opportunity.\nThis spell required a verbal component and a small wooden disk with concentric circles on it, resembling an archery target. After the Second Sundering, the spell only required a somatic component.\nOn the Malatran Plateau, both arcane and divine magics were harnessed using spell fetishes. True strike arcane spell fetish was a rune-etched arrowhead."
