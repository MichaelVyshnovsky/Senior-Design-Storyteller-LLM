        "mainbody": "'''''True strike''''' was a [[divination]] spell that allowed the caster to look a few seconds into the future and gain a great advantage to hit a target.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to look one move ahead and strike at the right place at the right time, with almost guaranteed success. This knowledge even negated the concealment of targets. The divination only revealed a few seconds into the future, so any hesitation to act on this knowledge was a lost opportunity.",
        "Components": "This spell required a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component and a small wooden disk with concentric circles on it, resembling an archery target. After the [[Second Sundering]], the spell only required a [[somatic component]].\n\nOn the [[Malatran Plateau]], both [[arcane]] and [[divine]] magics were harnessed using ''[[spell fetish]]es''. ''True strike arcane spell fetish'' was a rune-etched arrowhead.{{Cite organized play/LJ/An Army of One Thousand|5}}"
