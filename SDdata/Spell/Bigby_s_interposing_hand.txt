'''''Bigby's interposing hand''''' was an [[evocation]] spell that created a hand of force to block a targeted opponent from approaching.

==Effects==
This spell was one of the ''[[Bigby's hand]]'' family of spells. It created a hand about the size of an [[ogre]] or about 10 ft (3 m) tall with a finger span about the same as the height (earlier versions could be even larger) that was placed between the caster and a chosen opponent to gain partial cover from a ranged attack. The ''hand'' also slowed the approach of an opponent to half their normal speed if they weighed 2,000 lb (910 kg) or less, or at least made it difficult to advance if the opponent was stronger than the ''hand''.

All versions of this spell relied on the caster's senses to detect and locate the target, the ''hand'' did not have senses of its own, but once a target was designated the ''hand'' would remain interposed regardless of movement by the caster or the opponent and was unfazed by invisibility, darkness, polymorphing, or other means of concealment or disguise. The ''hand'' was difficult to injure, but could be destroyed by inflicting damage equivalent to what it would take to kill the caster in prime condition. The ''hand'' could be ''[[disintegrate]]d'' or ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' if it failed to resist such spells.

Range and duration varied widely over the history of this spell. For the earliest versions, a wizard that was just able to learn this spell could maintain the ''hand'' for nine minutes and cast it 90 ft (27 m) indoors/90 yd (82 m) outdoors. Later version lasted between 45 seconds and a minute but the reach was extended from 120 ft (37 m) to 190 ft (58 m) at a minimum.

When cast on [[Avernus]], the first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], the hand took on the form of the claw of a [[fiend]].

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a glove of some sort that varied as reported by different recordings of the spell. The earliest version could use any glove. A later version specified a "soft" glove and the next version made it a focus instead of a component, so it wasn't consumed in the casting. After the [[Second Sundering]] this was refined to a snakeskin glove and additionally required an [[egg]]shell (because many types of ''hand'' options were combined into one spell).

==History==
By the 1360s [[DR]] ''Bigby's interposing hand'' was known but rare among the magical communities of both [[Faer√ªn]],<ref> and [[Zakhara]].{{AQ-time}}<br/>
