'''''Death chariot''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] and [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by [[Silvanite]]s to summon a fiery [[chariot]].

==Effects==
This spell summoned a fiery chariot with a thunderous clap. The chariot was pulled by a pair of fiery [[horse]]s and could haul up to nine [[human]]-sized creatures and be controlled with verbal commands. In many ways it resembled a ''[[chariot of Sustarre]]''. The chariot felt hot when approached and touching the horses caused severe burns.

Both the chariot and horses could be harmed with water or enchanted weapons. The horses could be dismissed to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] via magic. The chariot could explode at a time chosen by the caster, or the caster could ride with the chariot and cause it to explode by sheer force of will at any time. The violent explosions harmed anyone nearbyâ€”including any passengers.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a small piece of wood, two [[holly]] berries, and a source of fire at least the size of a [[torch]] to cast.
