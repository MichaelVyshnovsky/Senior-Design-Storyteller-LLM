'''''Weapon of the earth''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[cleric]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell transformed a piece of stone into a weapon. The stone had to be of the same volume as the weapon. The weapon that was created was associated with the weapon of the caster's deity. The weapon acted as it's mundane equivalent, however it was immune to spells and effects the targeted metal. It was also immune to corrosion and rusting. The weapon was vulnerable to spells and effects that targeted stone. The weapon returned to its natural state once the spell expired.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s. It required the caster's [[holy symbol]], the targeted chunk of stone and a piece of [[iron]] ore. The iron ore was consumed by the spell.
