        "mainbody": "Decastave was an evocation/conjuration spell that converted a small piece of wood into a force-staff that could be wielded as a magic weapon.\nThe magical pole was of fixed length, 8-10 (2.4 m - 3 m) long 2\" (5 cm) in diameter, and rigidly inflexible. It could be wielded like a quarterstaff, possessed the thundering quality and could damage creatures immune to non-magical weapons. The decastave could be dissipated in a few ways\n* The wizard let go of it intentionally or accidentally.\n* It was pulled from the wizards grasp by one or more opponents exerting sufficient strength in a united effort.\n* It was cleaved by metal.\n* The spells duration was exceeded.\nOnce per casting of this spell, the wizard could elect to drain a small amount of health upon a successful hit. The health was transferred to the wizard similar to a vampiric touch but could not increase health beyond normal capacity.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components, and a small piece of wood that was consumed by the casting.\nThis spell was generally well-known around Faer√ªn once it had been published in the book, Volos Guide to All Things Magical, in 1359 DR."
