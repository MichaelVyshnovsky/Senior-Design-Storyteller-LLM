        "mainbody": "Ghost light was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur that created a fear-inducing green radiance. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, a faint green luminescence would appear. Wu jen had the ability to shape and control the light, which allowed them to give the illusion of a walking or flying ghost.\nIn many regions of Kara-Tur, local superstition was that evil or malicious spirits emitted green light, so this spell was often used to scare a wu jens enemies. The spell expired when the wu jen ceased concentrating on the spell. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a piece of phosphorus."
