        "mainbody": "'''''Ghost light''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]] that created a fear-inducing green radiance. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, a faint green luminescence would appear. Wu jen had the ability to shape and control the light, which allowed them to give the illusion of a walking or flying ghost.\n\nIn many regions of Kara-Tur, local superstition was that evil or malicious spirits emitted green light, so this spell was often used to scare a wu jen's enemies. The spell expired when the wu jen ceased concentrating on the spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a piece of [[phosphorus]]."
