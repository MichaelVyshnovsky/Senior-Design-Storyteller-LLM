        "mainbody": "A locust was a small and fast spaceship created and employed by the spacefaring inhabitants of Wa as a short-range support vessel of the larger tsunami spelljammers.\nLocusts were made of balsa wood and were shaped like locusts. Because of their small size and weight, they were extremely fast and maneuverable, but also extremely fragile.\nDue to their diminutive size and frailty, locusts could not be equipped with spelljamming helms. Instead, their propulsion system was a rudder of propulsion, a magic item developed by a wu jen in collaboration with a wizard from Cormyr.\nLocusts were typically employed in attack maneuvers, deployed from a tsunami to weaken or destroy a target while the larger ship stayed behind. They would either attack with a single built-in weapon or would simply ram into their targets, triggering a large explosion of their reservoir of Greek fire.\nIn the midâ€“14 century DR, locusts were primarily built in the Iiso spelljamming port."
