Spider poison was a necromancy spell used by wizards, sorcerers and assassins.
This spell allowed the caster to inject a target with a paralyzing poison if they were able to touch them. The poison quickly sapped the targets physical strength.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a live or dead spider to cast.
