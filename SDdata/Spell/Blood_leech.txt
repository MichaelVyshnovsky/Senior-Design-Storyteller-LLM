'''''Blood leech''''' was an [[Evocation|invocation]] [[Wikipedia:Birthright (campaign setting)#The Domain Level|realm spell]], a powerful ritual that could be cast only by drawing mystical energy from the land.{{Cite book | author = [[Richard Baker]], [[Colin McComb]] | title = [https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Publication:Birthright_Campaign_Setting Birthright Campaign Setting (Rulebook)] | date = 1995 | publisher = [[TSR, Inc.]] | pages = 81-82 | ISBN = 9-780786-901432}}<ref group="note">''Blood leech'' is part of the "Scions of the Desert" setting variant from [[Dragon magazine 233|''Dragon'' magazine 233]], which combines the rules from the [[Wikipedia:Birthright (campaign setting)|''Birthright'' campaign]] with the [[Al-Qadim]] setting to give a framework for playing [[Zakhara]]n regents. It was designed to steal a fraction of the power inherent in a person's bloodline,

==Effects==
With this spell, a small portion of the power that some [[Zakhara]]ns inherited from the [[Sharit|seven followers]] of the [[Loregiver]] could be transferred to the caster. The victim had to be within 20 miles (32 km) and known to the caster. ''Blood leech'' could affect a person only once during their life.{{Cite dragon/233/Campaign Classics: Scions of the Desert}}

==Components==
This ritual required power from a land with a strong natural flow of magic. The caster also needed to invest materials worth 2000 [[gp]], a pinch of [[bloodsilver]], and some of their metaphysical power of rulership.<ref>{{Cite book | author = [[Richard Baker]], [[Colin McComb]] | title = [https://dnd-wiki.org/wiki/Publication:Birthright_Campaign_Setting Birthright Campaign Setting (Rulebook)] | date = 1995 | publisher = [[TSR, Inc.]] | pages = 41, 55 | ISBN = 9-780786-901432}}

==History==
''Blood leech'' was one of the means used by the infamous [[yak folk]] of northern [[Zakhara]] to gain access to the bloodlines of the [[Sharit]] and the power they granted over the land.
