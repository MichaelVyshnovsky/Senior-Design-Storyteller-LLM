        "mainbody": "'''''Age object''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[time sphere]] that enabled the [[priest]] to dramatically age the object in question. The reverse form of the spell, '''''Youthful object''''', allowed one to restore an object's condition back to when it was new.",
        "Effects": "This spell could only be used upon non-living, non-magical objects. The amount of time an object aged depended on the skill of the caster, but could easily be centuries. The priest casting the spell did have control over how much aging the object received.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a flask of seawater and a lump of [[coal]] to cast ''age object''. To cast the ''youthful object'', the caster instead needed a piece of [[egg]]shell and a hair from a [[human]] or [[humanoid]] infant.",
        "History": "The ''[[timestave]]'', an [[enchanted]] [[quarterstaff]] wielded by [[Labelas Enoreth]], had the ability to ''age objects''."
