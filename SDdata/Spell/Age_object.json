        "mainbody": "Age object was a divine alteration spell from the time sphere that enabled the priest to dramatically age the object in question. The reverse form of the spell, Youthful object, allowed one to restore an objects condition back to when it was new.\nThis spell could only be used upon non-living, non-magical objects. The amount of time an object aged depended on the skill of the caster, but could easily be centuries. The priest casting the spell did have control over how much aging the object received.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a flask of seawater and a lump of coal to cast age object. To cast the youthful object, the caster instead needed a piece of eggshell and a hair from a human or humanoid infant.\nThe timestave, an enchanted quarterstaff wielded by Labelas Enoreth, had the ability to age objects."
