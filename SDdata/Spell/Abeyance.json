        "mainbody": "'''''Abeyance''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that delayed the release of magical effects from [[Item enchantment|magical items]].",
        "Effects": "This spell had two major effects, depending on its use. If ''abeyance'' was cast on a ''[[focal stone]]'' with a stored spell inside, it would delay its release, or transference, up to months or years, until otherwise altered by another spell or destroyed outright. If the ''focal stone'' was affected by ''[[dweomerflow]]'', ''[[wondrous web]]'' or ''[[holy vesting]]'' the spell within would dissipate or be transferred to another spell-storing object. Destruction of the stone would negate the ''abeyance'' and cause the spell to immediately take effect.\n\nIf ''abeyance'' was cast by a [[mage]] or [[priest]] while touching a non-[[artifact]] [[:Category:magic items|magical item]], it would temporarily delay the released effect upon the item's next activation.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
