        "mainbody": "'''''Solipsism''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[thought sphere]] that created a tactile [[illusion]].",
        "Effects": "The caster automatically believed the illusion created by this spell. Anyone besides the caster needed to make an effort to believe the illusion was real. Once believed, a ''solipsism'' was real for all intents and purposes, meaning a ''solipsim'' of a weapon could be used in actual combat as a real weapon. A ''solipsism'' remained active so long as the caster concentrated upon it.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a lotus blossum and a bit of [[fleece]] to cast. The caster swallowed the lotus blossum during the casting.",
        "History": "[[Deceiver genie]]s in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate, used the ''solipsism'' spell.{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Monstrous Compendium Pages}}"
