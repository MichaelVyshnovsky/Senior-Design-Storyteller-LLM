        "mainbody": "Solipsism was a divine alteration spell from the thought sphere that created a tactile illusion.\nThe caster automatically believed the illusion created by this spell. Anyone besides the caster needed to make an effort to believe the illusion was real. Once believed, a solipsism was real for all intents and purposes, meaning a solipsim of a weapon could be used in actual combat as a real weapon. A solipsism remained active so long as the caster concentrated upon it.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a lotus blossum and a bit of fleece to cast. The caster swallowed the lotus blossum during the casting.\nDeceiver genies in Zakhara, the Land of Fate, used the solipsism spell."
