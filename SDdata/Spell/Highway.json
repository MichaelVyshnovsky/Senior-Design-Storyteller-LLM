        "mainbody": "Highway was a special divine alteration and evocation quest spell from the travelers sphere that created a plane of force.\nThe plane of force measured  wide by  long. The plane of force served as a magical conveyor for the caster, allowing the caster and any followers standing on the plane to travel at a rate of  per hour in whatever direction the caster selected. The highway automatically navigated around or over any obstacles while also protecting the travelers from inclement weather conditions. The highway could hover in place without moving, but only at a height of  off the ground. The highway gently lowered the travelers to the ground when the destination was reached or the spell expired. The casters followers could depart the highway at any point along its travels, but the spell would end the moment the caster stepped off the highway.\nThis spell did not require spell components of any kind.\nThis spell was used by druids who served Moander during the height of ancient Netherils power."
