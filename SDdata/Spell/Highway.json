        "mainbody": "'''''Highway''''' was a special [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[evocation]] [[quest spell]] from the [[travelers sphere]] that created a plane of force.",
        "Effects": "The plane of force measured {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} wide by {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}} long. The plane of force served as a [[magic]]al conveyor for the caster, allowing the caster and any followers standing on the plane to travel at a rate of {{SI|30|mi|k|long=yes}} per hour in whatever direction the caster selected. The ''highway'' automatically navigated around or over any obstacles while also protecting the travelers from inclement weather conditions. The ''highway'' could hover in place without moving, but only at a height of {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} off the ground. The ''highway'' gently lowered the travelers to the ground when the destination was reached or the spell expired. The caster's followers could depart the ''highway'' at any point along its travels, but the spell would end the moment the caster stepped off the ''highway''.",
        "Components": "This spell did not require [[spell component]]s of any kind.",
        "History": "This spell was used by [[druid]]s who served [[Moander]] during the height of ancient [[Netheril]]'s power."
