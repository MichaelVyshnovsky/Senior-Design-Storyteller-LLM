'''''Wood rot''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s and [[wu jen]]. The spell was very rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
When cast, any object made of wood began to rot. Small wooden items were destroyed instantly, while ships or a wood building took several days to rot away. When cast on a plant-based creature, their body began to slowly decay.

''[[Prevent rot]]'' was the reverse of this spell. It stopped the rotting effect of ''wood rot''. It did not restore wood already decayed by the spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a live termite. ''Prevent rot'' required a dead termite.
