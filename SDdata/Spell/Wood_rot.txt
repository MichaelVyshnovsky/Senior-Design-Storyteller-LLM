Wood rot was a common spell used by druids and wu jen. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, any object made of wood began to rot. Small wooden items were destroyed instantly, while ships or a wood building took several days to rot away. When cast on a plant-based creature, their body began to slowly decay.
Prevent rot was the reverse of this spell. It stopped the rotting effect of wood rot. It did not restore wood already decayed by the spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a live termite. Prevent rot required a dead termite.
