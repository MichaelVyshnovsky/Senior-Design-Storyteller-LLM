        "mainbody": "Sword and hammer was a more advanced version of the common spiritual weapon spell utilized specifically by the clerics of the Church of Tyr, The spell could also be provided in scroll form by the holy relic known as the Balance of Belaros.\nWithin a medium range, this divine spell evoked a longsword and a warhammer of force in imitation of Tyrs own weapons. Depending on the power of the caster or version of the spell used, the mystical weapons could appear at normal or double size and appeared shadowy, not metallic. They struck silently.\nThe two weapons acted as mystical constructs and could be directed to attack any target, which they would do without any need for further control. If directed to attack a single opponent, they would always attempt to flank that opponent. Since they were created from force, they could strike illusions or incorporeal creatures and overcome certain magical defenses. Since they were themselves incorporeal, they could not be harmed by mundane means, but several spells could destroy them.\nMore powerful versions of the spell dealt further force damage and were more likely to inflict critical wounds.\nBy simply concentrating on them for a few moments, the caster could direct the weapons to cease attack or direct their attacks toward a new target. If they defeated their target or if they ever found themselves out of sight from the cleric who evoked them, they would return to his or her side automatically. It was impossible for anyone but the caster to control the weapons.\nThe weapons took six seconds or fewer to evoke and lasted for just over a minute to up to nearly a half hour, depending on the power of the caster and the version of the spell used. When the duration of the spell ended, the weapons vanished in a display of sparkling motes.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components and, by some accounts, the clerics holy symbol as well."
