        "mainbody": "eath, otherwise known in the giant language as dod, was a type of giant rune that allowed whoever wielded its inscribed object to inflict greater damage upon a specific foe.\nWhenever an inscribed weapon would first strike a creature that matched the specified inscription, it would inflict twice the amount of damage it normally would. Afterwards, the weapon would lose the death runes effect. However, any creature struck with the weapon that did not meet the specified inscription would not trigger this effect.\nExtensively studying this rune a second time would yield no changes to the effect. Though if a caster studied it a third time, then the death rune would be able make weapons inflict three times the amount of damage they normally would.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to eight hours and it needed to be inscribed upon a bladed weapon. During this shaping process the caster needed to inscribe next to the rune the name of a specific race, organization or nationality that they were intending to fight with it."
