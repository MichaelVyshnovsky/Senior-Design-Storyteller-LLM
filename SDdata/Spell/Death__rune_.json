        "mainbody": "'''''Death''''', otherwise known in the [[giant language]] as [[Giant dictionary|'''''dod''''']], was a type of [[giant]] rune that allowed whoever wielded its inscribed object to inflict greater damage upon a specific foe.",
        "Effects": "Whenever an inscribed weapon would first strike a creature that matched the specified inscription, it would inflict twice the amount of damage it normally would. Afterwards, the weapon would lose the ''death'' rune's effect. However, any creature struck with the weapon that did not meet the specified inscription would not trigger this effect.\n\nExtensively studying this rune a second time would yield no changes to the effect. Though if a caster studied it a third time, then the ''death'' rune would be able make weapons inflict three times the amount of damage they normally would.",
        "Components": "Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to eight hours and it needed to be inscribed upon a bladed [[weapon]]. During this shaping process the caster needed to inscribe next to the rune the name of a specific race, organization or nationality that they were intending to fight with it."
