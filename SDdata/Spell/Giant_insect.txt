'''''Giant insect''''', also known as '''''giant vermin''''',  was a [[transmutation]] or [[alteration]] spell that allowed the caster to grow [[centipede]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[spider]]s, [[beetle]]s, flies, [[wasp]]s or, similar creatures to much larger than their original size. The reverse of the spell, '''shrink insect''', could reduce giant insects down to normal size.

==Effects==
Only one type of creature could be affected per casting of these spells. The older version only worked on true insects, not spiders or scorpions, which are arachnids. The giant bugs were not hostile toward the spellcaster and could follow simple commands to attack or defend, hold position, follow, ''etc.''

==Components==
Only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, plus the priest's [[holy symbol]] were required to cast these spells.
