Grimwalds greymantle was an arcane necromancy spell that prevented healing or regeneration effects from working on a single creature for a short time.
The caster imbued the material component of this spell (a bone, small skull, or small animal skeleton) with a silver-gray glow which immediately had to come in contact with the target. If successful, the radiance was transferred to the target and enveloped it like a mantle. While surrounded by this aura, the target could not repair damage or regain health by any means, including healing spells such as cure light wounds and heal a potion of healing a staff of curing or regeneration effects such as a regeneration spell, a ring of regeneration, or a natural ability such as that possessed by trolls. Grimwalds graymantle lasted for a short time corresponding to the level of the caster. If it expired or was dispelled, any healing or regenerative effect still in place on the target creature began working again. The target got one chance to resist the spell, in which case it faded harmlessly away.
This spell was modified a few times in its history, making it less dangerous for the caster and improving the range at which it operated. For the original version, the caster had to wield the bone, skull, or skeleton like a dagger or a club and successfully hit the target, presumably in melee combat. If the caster missed his or her attack at the time of casting and again at the next opportunity to strike, then the gray aura spread to the caster and he or she could receive no healing until Grimwalds greymantle was dispelled or expired. The next version of this spell allowed the caster to throw the bone or skull up to 5 yd (4.6 m) per level of the caster at the target and avoid the ill effects of a failed attack. The newest version increased this range to 100 ft (30 m) plus 10 ft (3 m) per level of the caster.
This spell did not interfere with curing of disease, blindness, or deafness, nor did it prevent cause wound spells.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small bone or skull to charge with the gray aura. The original version also allowed for a small animal skeleton to be used.
Grimwalds greymantle was originally published in the "Tome of the Covenant" to commemorate the founding of the Covenant in the Year of the Covenant, 673 DR. The second version was later published in "Volos Guide to All Things Magical" and became generally known to the magical community.
