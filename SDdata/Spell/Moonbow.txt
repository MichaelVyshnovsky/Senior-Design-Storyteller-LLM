'''''Moonbow''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Sehanine Moonbow]].
 
==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a crystalline bow with a bowstring of silver light. Depending on the caster's needs, the bow was the same size and strength of a [[shortbow]] or a [[longbow]]. Only the caster was capable of using the bow.

When drawn, a magical silver arrow appeared in the bow, and on release, the arrow was trailed by ''[[motes of moonlight]]''. The effect of the arrow depended on the target. Against a living creature, the arrow delivered a bolt of energy from the [[Positive Material Plane]]. Against [[undead]] targets who drew their energy from the [[Negative Material Plane]], also creatures from said plane, the arrow delivered terrible damage and covered the target in silver ''[[faerie fire]]''. When fired at an undead creature who drew its power from the Positive Material plane, and any creature from said plane, it cured the target.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Sehanine Moonbow and a thread of cobweb covered in dew that was collected under the light of a full moon.
