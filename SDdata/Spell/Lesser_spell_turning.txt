Lesser spell turning, was an uncommon abjuration spell that caused spells cast against the spellcaster to turn upon the original caster, acting as a minor version of spell turning.
The spell affected incoming spells, including those from scrolls and innate abilities. However, it would not affect spells that were not solely focused on the target, i.e., area-of-effect spells, nor spells applied by touch or spells from magical objects. One to five spells could be rebounded&mdashdepending on the power of those spells&mdashbut the spellcaster would not be aware of this exact number.
If both the attacking and defending spellcasters were protected by such a spell, a resonating field would occur. Instead of the spell continually bouncing back and forth between the casters, the spell would most likely drain away. It was also possible that the resonating field would render the turning effects nonfunctional for a short duration. There was a low chance that the spell would affect both casters equally, striking them both for full damage. An incredibly small chance caused the resonating field to open a rift into the Positive Energy plane, sucking in both casters. No such resonating field was created between the caster of a lesser spell turning and a spell turning spell the spell turning spell effect always overcame the weaker spell.
Lesser spell turning was very limited, unlike its more powerful form. Only spells available to lesser casters could be turned, with no exception, but the defensive effects lasted for at least seven minutes or until the maximum number of spells had been reflected.
Verbal, somatic, and material components were needed to cast the spell. The single material component was a silver coin that was smoothly polished or a small silver mirror.
