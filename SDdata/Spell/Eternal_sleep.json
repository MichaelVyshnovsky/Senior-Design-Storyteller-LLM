        "mainbody": "Eternal sleep was a divine necromancy spell from the necromantic sphere that caused the spirit of a dead dragon to pass into the Outer Planes for all time.\nOnce cast upon a dragons corpse, the spirit of the dragon could never be raised or resurrected. Furthermore, the dragon could not be contacted via spells such as speak with the dead. This spell had no effect upon undead dragons.\nIn addition to verbal components, this spell required as a material component the priests holy symbol to cast.\nThis spell was granted to dragons by Null, the Death Wyrm."
