        "mainbody": "'''''Haste''''' was a spell that caused the affected target(s) to move and act more quickly than normal.",
        "Effects": "A creature under the effects of a ''haste'' spell could make quicker attacks and dodge attacks with their enhanced speed. Their speed in any form was also doubled. The spell affected up to five targets, or more for more experienced casters, provided they were in close range.",
        "Components": "The spell needed [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[material component]]s. The material component for a ''haste'' spell was a shaving of [[licorice]] root,\n\nIn the [[Chondathan]] spellcasting tradition of [[Turmish]], prior to the Time of Troubles, the verbal component for this spell was made up of harsh syllables and it had no material component.\n\nIn [[Kara-Tur]], a shaving of [[bamboo]] was required as a material component.",
        "History": "The [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Quantoul]] was given the credit for the creation of this spell in {{Yearlink|-2022}}; it was originally called '''''Quantoul's fastmorph'''''.\n\nAfter the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], the spell had the side effect of aging the user one full year. After the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, that was no longer the case."
