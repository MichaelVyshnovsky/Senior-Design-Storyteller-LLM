'''''Twilight sanctuary''''' was a ''channel divinity'' power granted to [[cleric]]s who chose the [[Twilight domain]].

==Effects==
As a cleric of this domain channeled divinity by displaying their [[holy symbol]], a sphere of soothing twilight surrounded them. The dimly-lit sphere had a diameter of {{SI|60|ft}} and moved with the direction of the caster for a minute. Every 6 seconds, anyone in the sphere could gain additional fortitude or stop being frightened or charmed. The sphere would fade should the cleric become incapacitated.
