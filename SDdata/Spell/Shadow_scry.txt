'''''Shadow scry''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[dragon]] to use any shadow within their lair as a [[scrying]] device, and readily gain a visual perspective as if they were standing within its borders.

==Effects==
Using this spell, a dragon was capable of looking into its lair, as if it were standing within the shadow that had been chosen upon its casting. It could see from any angle or perspective over the area which the shadow was cast, as if using its natural vision.

During the spell's duration, the shadow radiated a faint magical aura; it was detectable by ''[[detect scrying]]'' and could be negated by spells such as ''[[screen]]'' or ''[[dispel magic]]'', along with other divination-obscuring magic. Additionally its effects ended if the dragon cast another spell or moved beyond a distance of 30' (9.1 m).

==Casting==
This spell required only a [[verbal component]]. The shadow chosen had to be within the caster's line of sight and within a distance of of 30' (9.1 m).
