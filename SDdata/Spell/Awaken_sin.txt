Awaken sin was an enchantment spell used by Silverhair Knights.
Awaken sin was designed to confront evildoers, particularly drow, with the consequences of their malevolent actions in a stark and somewhat disconcerting manner. When a targeted creature was subjected to this spell but managed to resist its full impact, the abrupt resurgence of memories reflecting their sinful deeds resulted in a temporary impairment. 
If the targeted creature failed to resist the spell, it experienced a profound psychological trauma. The cumulative effect of their past cruelties and acts of hatred became momentarily overwhelming, inflicting intense psychological distress. This distress translated into physical harm. The trauma was so great the targeted creature was temporarily stunned or even rendered unconscious.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a divine focus to cast.
This spell was increasingly being adopted by various religious groups that advocated for the redemption of sinners. Among these groups, paladins devoted to Ilmater have shown a significant affinity for the spell.
