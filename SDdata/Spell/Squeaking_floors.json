        "mainbody": "Squeaking floors was an evocation spell that caused a solid surface to emit loud squeaks whenever touched or tread upon.\nThis spell could be cast on any flat surface.The source states the area of effect in two different ways. In the spell summary it says a \"10-foot square/level\" but in the spell description it says \"a square whose sides equal the casters level times 10 feet\" which is considerably larger. The actual material of the surface was not important stone, wood, dirt, etc., as long as it was solid. Whenever the surface was stepped on or touched by a creature larger than a typical rat (3 lb/1.4 kg or 0.5 ft3/0.014 m3) the enchanted surface would squeak loudly enough to be heard 100 ft (30.5 m) away. The sound could be heard and direction determined regardless of doors, walls, floors or other interposing barriers. Even creatures who could move silently were only able to halve the distance the sound traveled.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a rusty iron hinge that squeaked as a material component."
