'''''Necrotic skull bomb''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that imbued a [[humanoid]] skull with [[negative energy]]. The skull could then be thrown as a projectile that would burst upon impact, releasing the energy stored within.

==Effects==
Any living creature caught within the blast of a ''necrotic skull bomb'' was drained of their life force in a similar manner to the spell ''[[energy drain]]''. If they survived the initial effects they would slowly regain their energy over the course of a number of hours, depending on the skill of this spell's caster.

This spell had a different effect on the [[undead]], making them more robust for the duration of an hour.

==Casting==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the skull of a humanoid creature.
