Battering ram was an uncommon evocation spell  used by sorcerers and wizards that duplicated the effects of a ring of the ram.
For a matter of seconds, the casters arm was surrounded with a translucent arcane force that appeared in the form of a rams head over their hand. For the spells duration the caster possessed great strength, comparable to that of a hill giant and could readily smash, break or otherwise damage people and creatures with their punch.
Alternately, they could blast the force energy up to  away in a direction of their choosing.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a focus, a carved horn from a ram.
This spell was readily available to guild members of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors as well as members of the City Watch of Waterdeep.
