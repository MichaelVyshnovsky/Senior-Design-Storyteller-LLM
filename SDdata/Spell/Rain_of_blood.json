        "mainbody": "'''''Rain of blood''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was favored by the [[Red Eyes]] sorcerous society.",
        "Effects": "This spell called forth a cloudburst of blood from the [[Negative Material Plane]]. The blood was far more red compared to ordinary blood. The blood leeched vitality whenever it touched bare skin.\n\nTargets would continue to suffer negative effects as long as they remained unsheltered under the rain of blood. Targets wearing less protective armor suffered more damage compared to well-armored targets.\n\nThis spell was only usable by [[necromancer]]s.",
        "Components": "This spell required a small vial of pure water to cast."
