'''''Whirlwind of bones''''' was an [[arcane]] [[necromancy]] spell invented by [[Aulstaer Mrelgaunt]] that animated a pile of bones to attack a target.

==Effects==
The ''whirlwind of bones'' was not actually a wind, just bones that flew around as if they were being held aloft by a whirlwind. The bones flew where the caster directed them, with flawless maneuverability at a rapid pace (almost triple the normal land speed for a [[human]]) out to a minimum range of 680 ft (over 200 m) and operated in a sphere of 20 ft (6.1 m) radius. When the ''whirlwind of bones'' came to rest, it inflicted damage on all creatures within its volume. Half the damage was from the bludgeoning done by the bones themselves, and the other half was from [[negative energy]]. Victims who successfully dodged some of the flying bones were less injured.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a group of bones roughly equivalent to the skeleton of a medium- or large-sized creature. The bones could not be restricted from taking flight, such as buried underground, or being a part of a living, [[undead]], or [[Construct|constructed]] creature.
