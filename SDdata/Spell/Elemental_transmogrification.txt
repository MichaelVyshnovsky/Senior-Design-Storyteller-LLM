}}'''''Elemental transmogrification''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This spell affected any item with ties to one of the four elements. Example: Items connected to the element of sand included [[gem]]s, metal, and glass.

The base area of effect for this spell was a 10 ft. (3.1 m) diameter circle. Casters with more command of magic were able to create much larger circles.

This spell transformed items connected to one element into an entirely different element. The new element was chosen by the caster. [[Elemental mage]]s and [[Sorcerer (kit)|Sorcerers]] could only select the elements they were devoted to. The effects of this spell were permanent. Items transformed in this manner were transported to the [[elemental plane]] of their new element one minute after being transformed.

==Components==
This spell did not require physical components to cast.
