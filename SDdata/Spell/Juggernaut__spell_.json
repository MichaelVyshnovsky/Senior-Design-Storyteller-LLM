        "mainbody": "Juggernaut was a powerful wizard spell from the school of evocation that created a gigantic being. It was a very rare spell in the Realms, but was notably used by the Seven Sisters. It bore no relation to the juggernaut construct.\nThe spell conjured a huge, genderless, naked humanoid form that rose up out of the ground, in front of but facing away from the caster. It was bald and featureless but for a mouth and its material resembled the earth from which it rose, but was it was not actually earth, but rather a manifestation of magic. The juggernaut could be up to  tall with a reach of .\nVia silent will, the caster could direct it to move around and attack and crush targets with its fists, or to grasp and carry things, including living creatures. Beings that escaped its grasped fell from that great height. It could also hurl those it had caught.\nJuggernauts could utter (or rather roar) up to six words chosen by the caster (and whispered during casting), but these could not serve as triggers or spell incantations and could not even be said if they were. If within  of the caster, the juggernaut would attract and absorb all magic cast at the caster, and either suffer its effects or nullify those that exploded or reflected from solid surfaces. The caster could not launch spells through it. The juggernaut could not use magic like wands, or wear magic items like rings.\nThe juggernaut would simply fade away if destroyed or when the spell ended.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a ball of clay that filled the casters palm, a piece of string, and a gem worth at least 500 gp to cast."
