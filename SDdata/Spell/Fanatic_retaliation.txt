'''''Fanatic retaliation''''' was a unique [[evocation]] [[spell]] from the third circle of magic used in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Effects==
The ''fanatic retaliation'' spell was cast as a reaction, mere moments after the caster's ally was slain. The spell always targeted the creature that landed the killing blow by launching a powerful [[psionic]] barrage that had a chance of rendering the target ''[[silence]]d'' for twelve seconds. Creatures of formidable intelligence had a chance of reduce the damage by half and shrug the magical ''silence'' off. This magical rebuke had the range of {{SI|60'|'"|long=yes}}. The effects of ''fanatic retaliation'' could not be strengthened by a casting at a higher proficiency level.

==History==
This unique sell was known and was used by the [[drider]] [[Kar'niss]], a worshiper of the [[Absolute]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}. He would unleash the deadly spell when one of his spindleweb fanatics was slain.
