Vision was a divination spell that granted the caster knowledge of tales about a given person, place, or thing.
This spell worked in the same manner as legend lore, but vision was faster and also more taxing on the caster, draining some of their own worldly experience. The caster posed a question regarding a certain being, location, or item, before they cast vision. If the subject was available, he or she might receive a vision about it, depending on their scrying or casting ability and how well-known the information in question was.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Zahn in  and was originally called Zahns vision.
