        "mainbody": "Shadowsteal was a wizard spell from the schools of alteration and illusion.\nThis spell could be triggered at the time of casting or long after by either uttering a command word or the fulfillment of specific conditions set at the time of casting. It affected the caster or a willing recipient touched by the caster.\nWhen under the influence of a shadowsteal the recipient acquired a shapeshifting shadowy appearance that utterly concealed their identity. They retained all of their normal skills and abilities. The continually shifting appearance also emitted changing signatures of heat that confounded infravision.\nThe target could open a dimension door at any time while the spell was active, but doing so instantly ended the spell. A shadowsteal could be negated only by a dispel magic spell or the death of the spells target.\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast.\nIn ages past this spell was a preferred method of wizards to kill a foe and escape without getting caught."
