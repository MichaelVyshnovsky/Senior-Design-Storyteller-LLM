Daltims fiery tentacles was an arcane conjuration spell that caused flaming tentacles to emerge from the ground and grapple and burn creatures within reach. It was developed by Daltim Flamefist of Halruaa.
The spell functioned in all ways like the well-known Evards black tentacles To this, Daltims fiery tentacles added a blue-white flame that wreathed the writhing members, burning as well as crushing the unfortunates trapped within.
Like Evards black tentacles, Daltims fiery tentacles required the usual verbal and somatic components and a piece of a tentacle of a giant octopus or squid.
The spell was developed by the Halruaan mage Daltim Flamefist sometime in the midâ€“14th century DR.
By 1373 DR, Daltims fiery tentacles was also known to Thebadol, a Halruaan elder.
