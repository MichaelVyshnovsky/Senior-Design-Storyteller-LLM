Greater malison was an uncommon enchantment spell that caused a group of creatures to become cursed for a limited time, making them more likely to fail in areas they usually would not.
The spell affected all hostiles within a sphere of a 30 ft (9.1 m) radius, adversely affecting their chance to succeed in all skills. Alternatively, the caster could make the targets more susceptible to spells from a certain school of magic. Greater malison had a range of 60 ft (18.3 m), and the duration of the curse scaled with the ability of the wizard.
Only a verbal component was required to cast the spell.
