'''''Contact archetype''''' was a [[spell]] that could only be cast by [[dragon]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell allowed a dragon to attempt contact with one of the two main dragon deities and seek answers to a question. [[Metallic dragon]]s used this spell to contact [[Bahamut]], and [[chromatic dragon]]s used this spell to contact [[Tiamat]]. Both Bahamut and Tiamat avoided contact in this fashion so answers given were short and to the point. The amount of question a dragon may ask was determined by their skill level. If either deity did not know the answer to a specific question, they would just give an incorrect answer. Using this spell was risky, as the dragon risked becoming insane due to contact with such powerful dragons.

==Casting==
This spell required only a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component.
