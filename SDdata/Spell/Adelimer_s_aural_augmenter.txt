Adelimers aural augmenter was a unique alteration spell found in Jalusters Orizon. This spell was developed by Adelimer.
This spell was a variation of the extension I spell with a few minor differences. This spell extended the duration of elementary spells but was able to be cast in half the time as extension I.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast.
