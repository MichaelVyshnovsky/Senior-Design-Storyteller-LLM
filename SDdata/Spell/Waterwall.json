        "mainbody": "'''''Waterwall''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] granted to priests of [[Istishia]]. It created a wall of water that could engulf a creature or foil missile attacks.",
        "Effects": "This spell created a wall of water within a range of {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} from the caster. It was {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} tall and a minimum of {{SI|35|ft|long=yes}} wide (wider for more advanced casters). The water appeared even if no water was available in the immediate area and lasted for at least seven minutes (longer for more experienced casters). If the spell was targeted to engulf a creature, it had a good chance to jump out of the way before the wall fully materialized.\n\nCreatures shorter than the ''waterwall'' that attempted to pass through it were paralyzed as if by a ''[[hold person]]'' or similar effectâ€”they were unable to continue or retreat and were helpless against melee attacks from outside. The paralyzing effect could be countered with a ''[[ring of free action]]'' or other such magics. Creatures taller than the wall were ''[[slow]]ed'' to one-quarter speed. ''Waterwall'' spoiled the aim of all missiles that were fired through it. This included ''[[magic missile]]s'' and any other offensive spell that attempted to shoot through the wall. However, creatures trapped inside the watery prison could be successfully targeted.\n\n''Waterwall'' could be turned to ice instantly by using spells such as ''[[cone of cold]]'' or ''[[Otiluke's freezing sphere]]''. Trapped creatures suffered the full effects of the cold-based spell.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s as well as a vial of water and the priest's [[holy symbol]]."
