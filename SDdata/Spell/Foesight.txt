Foesight was a divine divination spell from the divination sphere that alterted the caster to the presence of enemies.
This spell informed the caster when enemies approached and their approximate numbers. The spells magic extended outward from the caster for several miles depening on their skill.
The reverse of this spell, hidden hatred, was centered on the caster and masked their approach to an enemy until they were within  of them.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the casters holy symbol to cast.
Kyri carried several scrolls with the foesight spell.
