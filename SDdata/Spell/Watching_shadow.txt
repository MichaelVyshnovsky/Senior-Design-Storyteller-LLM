'''''Watching shadow''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Mask]], enabling them to see through a shadow.

==Effects==
This spell created a mobile shadow that allowed the caster to see anything near the shadow. The caster could move the ''watching shadow'' around by silent will, visualizing the shadow's surroundings out to a point that their own eyes would normally be able to see. Walls with lead or [[gorgon]]'s blood served as an effective barrier to this spell. This spell would end if the caster began casting another spell.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
