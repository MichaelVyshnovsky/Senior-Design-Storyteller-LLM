        "Effects": "This spell created and upright cone of shadowy force surrounding either the caster or a target they touched. The ''tempestcone'' drank all incoming magical energy for any source, converting the energy into ''[[magic missile]]s''. The ''magic missiles'' would be hurled unerringly at any target within {{SI|140|ft|long=yes}}. A quick mental command was all that was needed to hurl the missiles. This could be done even if the being inside of the ''tempestcone'' was not a spellcaster. The number of ''magic missiles'' created depended on the strength of the spell they absorbed, but even the weakest spell would create a pair of ''magic missiles''.\n\nIf on solid ground, the ''tempestcone'' would come to a point a few feet about the caster's head and terminate at the ground. If the caster was flying or not standing on solid ground, the ''tempestcone'' would end just below the lowest part of their body.",
