Spiteful glamor is an invocation used by dark pact warlocks. Spiteful glamor, when cast, tears into the mind of any creature of the warlocks choosing within fifty feet, causing them great pain. The spell is even deadlier when used against creatures who havent yet been injured. With more experience, warlocks can increase the power of spiteful glamor, which draws upon the warlocks strength of will and personality for much of its deadly power.
