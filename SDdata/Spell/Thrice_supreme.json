Their skill in hand-to-hand combat and use of a melee weapon were both increased. The spell also increased the ability to cast spells with a touch effect.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, three black sapphires of equal size. Each sapphire had to be worth at least 250 gp each.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
