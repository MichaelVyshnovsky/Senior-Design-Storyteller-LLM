'''''Dimensional folding''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[numbers sphere]] that allowed the caster to warp the fabric of space.

==Effects==
This spell folded the space around the caster, allowing for instantaneous travel to a selected location within range by stepping through a created gateway. This spell was best used only if the casting [[priest]] was familiar with the selected destination, otherwise the act of stepping through folded space had a chance to age the caster, and anyone traveling with them, by several years.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a sheet of [[platinum]] worth at least 15 [[gp]] to cast. The sheet was intricately folded and consumed during the casting.

==History==
The ''[[Scepter of Mystra]]'', a relic of the [[Mystra]]n faith, could cast the ''dimensional folding'' spell.{{cite book/Prayers from the Faithful|77-80}}
