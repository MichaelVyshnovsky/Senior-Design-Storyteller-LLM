'''''Lantern light''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that shot rays of [[divine]] light from the caster's eyeballs, dealing minor damage.<ref>

==Effect==
Once cast, holy light beamed out away from the caster and towards their target. The more powerful the caster, the more rays they could shoot. The target would take damage from each of the holy rays.

==Components==
As well as typical components, the caster must have abstained from copulation for at least a day before casting ''lantern light''.
