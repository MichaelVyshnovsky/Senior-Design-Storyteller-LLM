Thunderball was an uncommon evocation spell of the southern magic tradition.
The spell created an explosive blast of lightning followed by a clap of thunder. It caused damage to all creatures within 20 feet (6 meters), the thunder causing hearing damage to some. A single creature could be targeted, and they were automatically deafened as well as taking twice the damage.   
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, an amber rod.
