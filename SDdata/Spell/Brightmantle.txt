The recipient became lucid and clear-headed if inebriated or under the influence of charm or enchantment-based effects and spells. When cast as a protective measure, the spell protected the recipient from the effects of many spells such as ''[[chaos]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[confusion]]'', ''[[delude]]'', ''[[feeblemind]]'', ''[[friends]]'', ''[[forget]]'', ''[[magic jar]]'', ''[[mental domination]]'', ''[[scare]]'' and ''[[suggestion]]''.
