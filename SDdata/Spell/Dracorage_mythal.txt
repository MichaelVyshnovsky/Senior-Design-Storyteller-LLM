The '''Dracorage mythal''' was a magical effect created at the end of the [[Time of Dragons]] by [[High mage]]s of the [[Fair Folk]]. This [[High Magic]] effect tied a [[Faer没n]]-wide ''[[mythal]]'' to the [[King-Killer Star]].

==Effect==
The Dracorage mythal encompassed roughly a {{SI|250000|sq mi|k|long=yes}} area where the [[King-Killer Star]] was visible over Faer没n and caused all [[dragon]] and dragon-blooded creatures to slowly become more agitated and reckless, eventually becoming little more than raging beasts, when the star was actually visible; the phenomenon was known as the ''[[Rage of Dragons]]''.

==History==
The mythal's effects were first felt in {{yearlink|-25000}}, possibly from the work of Lady [[Winterflower Duskmere]], though other sources placed the start of the rage in {{yearlink|-24500}} {{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|9}} and in {{yearlink|-24000}}. At a later date, the dragons retaliated, attacking the capstone en masse; elves successfully defended the location, leaving the area littered with interminable bones millenia later, a large number of which were [[avariel]].

Some years prior to {{yearlink|1373}}, Sammaster reached the mythal's capstone through a portal hidden in the [[Novularond]] mountains.{{cite book/The Ruin|55|2}} Though he had triggered certain effects as far back as [[Uktar 9]] of the {{yearlinkName|1372}},{{cite book/The Rage|209|14}} it wasn't until by [[Hammer 1]] of 1373 DR he had completed the alterations, using his own [[phylactery]] to bind the mythal itself to energies drawn from the [[Abyss]], which would power it rather than the [[King-Killer Star]]:{{cite book/The Ruin|323-324|13}} this way, he started a continuous Rage of Dragons.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|153}}

Eventually, a force of dragons led by King [[Tamarand]], the [[Talons of Justice]], [[Dorn Graybrook]] and the wizards of [[Thentia]] broke into the heart of the Rage and slew the guardians.{{cite book/The Ruin|283|12}} Though Sammaster fought them every step of the way, his alterations, alongside the ''mythal'' itself were finally broken by [[Pavel Shemov]]{{cite book/The Ruin|330|13}} on [[Nightal 6]] of that year, ending the Rages forevermore.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|154}}<ref>

The heart of the Rage lay within a structure of stone, raised magically, with barbicans, spires, and towers, the terrain around it littered with an incredible amount of [[avariel]]{{cite book/The Ruin|175|7}} and dragon bones{{cite book/The Ruin|166-167|7}} hidden in a rocky valley somewhere on the northernmost reaches of the Faerunian continent. The location was so far north that the days were extremely short in comparison with the nights.{{cite book/The Ruin|186|7}} The area was prowled by at least one [[ghost dragon]].{{cite book/The Ruin|187|8}} Strange events littered the landscape, the product of much magic and death.{{cite book/The Ruin|174|7}} There were also remains of a golem or earth elemental; the local flora included lichen, bistort, coltsfoot,{{cite book/The Ruin|179-180|7}} and spadderdock.{{cite book/The Ruin|250-251|10}} A single portal led from a hidden citadel within the [[Novularond]]s to a passage carved into the walls of the valley, allowing for a degree of separation with the fortress housing the mythal itself.

As of 1373 DR, it was protected by six [[Tarterian dragon]]s in service of [[Sammaster]].{{cite book/The Ruin|176|7}} The passage itself was guarded by a [[dragonbone golem]].{{cite book/The Ruin|165|7}} A ward around the citadel itself transported those who attempted to enter it instead across its whole span, also preventing anyone from teleporting inside.{{cite book/The Ruin|189|8}}

Some parts of the place had other disturbing effects{{cite book/The Ruin|214|9}} and a pocket of especially virulent pocket of enchantment lay somewhere.{{cite book/The Ruin|215-216|9}} The corrupted enchantment in the valley, when it affected Taegan sufficiently, had a similar effect to the ''[[microcosm]]'' psionic power, creating for Taegan the illusion he'd always just been a highborn rake in Lyrabar with an odd compulsion to climb and jump, which he barely managed to disbelieve in time to avoid hitting the ground after falling from flight due to the illusion.{{cite book/The Ruin|216-218|9}}

The dracorage mythal itself was embodied in a room within the citadel, with a silver pentacle inlaid on the ground, with black walls and ceiling on which the night sky had been depicted with gemstones; a gigantic ruby traling carmelians stood in for the King-Killer Star. After Sammaster's meddling in 1373, a number of portals on the room's walls generated color flashes, which were visible from outside the room. The lich had also placed two guardians at the entrance of the room, an [[ironwyrm golem]] and a [[drakestone golem]].{{cite book/The Ruin|312-314|13}}
