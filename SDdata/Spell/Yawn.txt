'''''Yawn''''' was a person-affecting [[cantrip]] that beginning [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It caused one target creature to briefly feel drowsy, which resulted in a yawn, and made them more susceptible to ''[[sleep]]'' spells.

==Effects==
This cantrip was had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and could target one creature. If the target resisted the magic of this spell, then it had no effect. If they failed to resist, then the target involuntarily yawned and, depending on the size or toughness of the creature, was subject to enhanced effects of a ''sleep'' spell for the next minute or two. Specifically, the subject of ''yawn'' fell into a coma-like slumber instead of a light doze. The victim of ''yawn'' also did not count toward the total number of creatures that the ''sleep'' spell could affect.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster cupped both hands together and rocked them like a cradle while humming a lullaby.
