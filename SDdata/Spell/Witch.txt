'''Witch''' was a term with multiple meanings in the Realms, but was most frequently misapplied to any kind of [[wizard]]{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-06-06 - Gendered Terms for Spellcasters}}{{Cite organized play/LC/Dark Harvest|8}} and commonly carried a connotation of [[evil]].

==Types of Witch==
* A "witch" could refer to a type of wizard, usually female, who gained instruction in the ways of [[magic]] from an extra-planar patron, such as [[Graz'zt]].<ref> Those who used this meaning referred to males as "warlocks".Warlock in this case does not refer to the 4th edition character class, [[Warlock]], but there are definite similarities. In the [[Feywild]], this entity was typically an [[archfey]] or the goddess [[Sehanine Moonbow]].
* For [[Elminster]] and those of his generation, "witch" referred to any self-taught herbalist or spellcaster of [[arcane magic]]. Such witches usually lived a rural life, in villages or land that bordered wilderness, and mainly concerned themselves with making a living through casting [[spell]]s applicable to daily life. 
* [[Bubudow]] were witches that specialized in the use of medicinal [[herb]]s.
* '''Mediums''', also known as '''spirit channelers''', were witches that specialized in [[necromancy]] and communicating with the dead. The entities these witches gained instruction and [[spell]]s from were [[spirit]]s.

==History==
In [[1100 DR]], the term "witch" began commonly being used in some areas of the Realms as a pejorative for female spellcasters and servitors of [[hag]]s. Such as in [[Chessenta]], [[Turmish]], and the [[Vilhon Reach]]. Such usage would last into the 1300's [[DR]],

In the 14{{th}} Century DR, one could sometimes find [[spellsinger]]s being referred to as witches in the [[Western Heartlands]]. Around that same time, it was not uncommon for superstitious people in [[the Vast]] to label mages as "witches" and burn them on a [[stake]]. and fearful citizenry of [[Ravens Bluff]] were referring to local [[Eilistraean]] [[drow]] as "black-eared witches",<ref> and people on the continent of [[Kara-Tur]] were occasionally using the term to refer to individual women who were [[wu-jen]].

On [[Eleint 13]], in the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, the wizard [[Alice Clarkson]] was burned at the stake by the villagers of [[Mossbridges]] under suspicsion of witchcraft after a rash of [[cow]] killings. Shortly afterwards, the true culprits were revealed to be two [[troll]]s and a [[gnoll]].

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the term "witch" had taken on a negative connotation in the [[Moonsea]] region.<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Quelling the Horde|6-7}}

==Notable "Witches"==
