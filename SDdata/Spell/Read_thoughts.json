        "mainbody": "Read thoughts was a channel divinity power granted to clerics who chose the Knowledge domain.\nWhen using this power, the cleric could attempt to gain access to the surface thoughts of a creature within 60 ft (18.3 m), similarly to a detect thoughts spell. If successful, the cleric could then command the creature for up to one minute, effectively putting the creature under the effects of a suggestion spell. Afterwards, the creature became immune to attempts coming from the same cleric until the next day.\nAs the cleric progressed and became more powerful, this power became more difficult to resist."
