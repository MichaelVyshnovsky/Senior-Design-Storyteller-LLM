Venom immunity was a necromancy spell used in the Underdark.
This spell rendered either the caster or recipient immune to all toxins for the duration of the spell. Unlike an antidote or the higher-level neutralize poison spell, venom immunity did not cure the target of their existing toxins.
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
