        "History": "''Lightning bug'' was developed by [[Gemidan]], who served as apprentice to the original [[Blackstaff]] [[Khelben Arunsun]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. By the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]], it was known by several of Gemidan's close friends and comrades and was made readily available to members of [[Waterdeep|Waterdeep's]] [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] and [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]]."
