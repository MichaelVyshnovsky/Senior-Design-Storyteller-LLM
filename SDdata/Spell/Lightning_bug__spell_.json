        "mainbody": "Lightning bug was an alteration/evocation spell that created a small mote of electricity that could shock an individual.\nThis spell was created as an amalgamation of the spells magic missile and shocking grasp. When a lightning bug struck a person, or a similarly conductive material, it generated an electrical charge that increased depending on the skill and experience of the caster.\nThis spell only required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast.\nLightning bug was developed by Gemidan, who served as apprentice to the original Blackstaff Khelben Arunsun during the 14 century DR. By the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, it was known by several of Gemidans close friends and comrades and was made readily available to members of Waterdeeps City Guard and City Watch."
