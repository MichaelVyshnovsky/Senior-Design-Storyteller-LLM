Fang fist was a spell that was commonly used by alhoons.
When cast, one of the casters lower arms was transformed into a flexible appendage with a mouth at the end. The appendage resembled a snake. The mouth was filled with razor-sharp fangs. The length of the appendage was variable, from 1–14 feet (0.3–4.3 meters) in length. It could extend to its full length with incredible speed. The appendages strength was the same as the casters. The caster was able to use the appendages mouth to grasp items. This spell could not be combined with any poison-based spells. While it was in effect, the caster could only case spells which had only a verbal component.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
