        "mainbody": "Death chariot was a powerful divine conjuration and evocation spell used by Silvanites to summon a fiery chariot.\nThis spell summoned a fiery chariot with a thunderous clap. The chariot was pulled by a pair of fiery horses and could haul up to nine human-sized creatures and be controlled with verbal commands. In many ways it resembled a chariot of Sustarre. The chariot felt hot when approached and touching the horses caused severe burns.\nBoth the chariot and horses could be harmed with water or enchanted weapons. The horses could be dismissed to the Elemental Plane of Fire via magic. The chariot could explode at a time chosen by the caster, or the caster could ride with the chariot and cause it to explode by sheer force of will at any time. The violent explosions harmed anyone nearbyâ€”including any passengers.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a small piece of wood, two holly berries, and a source of fire at least the size of a torch to cast."
