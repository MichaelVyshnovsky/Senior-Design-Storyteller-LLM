'''''Mist magic''''' was a common [[evocation]] spell that created a mist of water.

==Effects==
The spell was similar to ''[[wall of fog]]''. Upon being cast, a thick, concealing mist was created, up to 20 feet (6 meters) wide and anywhere within 70 yards (64 meters) of the caster. Unlike ''wall of fog'', this mist could move, either following the caster or in a direction of the caster's choosing. If the caster chose to send it in one direction, that direction was fixed until the spell expired.

Wind did not move or dissipate the mist, although a strong wind reduced the duration of the spell. If the caster used a teleportation spell, such as ''[[blink]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', or ''[[teleport]]'', the mist remained until the spell expired.

The mist was very thick, able to conceal all vision, even [[infravision]], beyond 2 ft (0.6 m). It was also very wet; the mist could douse campfires and even structure fires. As a result, this spell was used by wizards across [[Faer√ªn]] to extinguish house and forest fires. Any fire-based attack which was either cast in the mist or passed through the mist was significantly reduced in strength.

''[[Hold vapor]]'' was able to contain the mist, and ''[[dispel magic]]'' would dissipate the mist entirely.

==Components==
The spell required verbal, [[somatic component|somatic]], and material components.
