        "mainbody": "'''''Vision''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] that granted the caster knowledge of tales about a given person, place, or thing.",
        "Effects": "This spell worked in the same manner as ''[[legend lore]]'', but ''vision'' was faster and also more taxing on the caster, draining some of their own worldly experience. The caster posed a question regarding a certain being, location, or item, before they cast ''vision''. If the subject was available, he or she might receive a vision about it, depending on their [[scrying]] or casting ability and how well-known the information in question was.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Zahn]] in {{Yearlink|-922}} and was originally called '''''Zahn's vision'''''."
