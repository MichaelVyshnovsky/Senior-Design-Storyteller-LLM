Mailed might was an arcane evocation spell that protected the caster with illusory armor.
The spell cloaked either the caster or a touched target with illusory armor. The armor was weightless and did not hinder the target in any way, making spellcasting possible. The armor was invisible to the target, but others viewed it as ghostly armor. The armor protected the target as if they were wearing a real suit of plate mail. The armor was not electrically conductive and was not harmed by rust or other attacks targeted toward metal.
Additionally, mailed might created illusions of several large ominous looking creatures that stood behind the target and often caused others to flee in terror at their sight.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a fragment of real armor to cast.
This spell was found within Selvars Ineffable Conjurations, Magicks, and Phantasms.
