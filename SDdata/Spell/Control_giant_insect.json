        "mainbody": "'''''Control giant insect''''' was a very rare [[spell]] that was used by [[cleric]]s of [[Lathander]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell allowed the caster to control any giant insect. It functioned on a single natural giant insect or an insect that has been magically enlarged. Since caster was required to control the targeted insect from a distance, this prevented the caster from using this spell to employ a giant insect as a mount. The caster was able to perform complex tasks remotely via the enchanted insect.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a piece of the same species of the targeted insect. For example, a [[giant spider]] could be enchanted with this spell by using a leg from a regular spider.",
        "History": "This spell was developed from the ''[[control aratha]]'' spell, which was uniquely used by the clerics of the [[Dawnspire]], a temple of [[Lathander]] in [[Myth Drannor]], to control [[aratha]]s."
