Horror was a necromancy spell that caused all opponents that could not resist to flee in extreme fear. It was similar to the fear spell, but did not operate in a cone shape, and could be cast by less-experienced wizards.
The mage could cast the spell up to 40 feet (12 meters) away. All enemies within a 30-foot (9.1 meter) radius would attempt to run away from the caster in fear. However, some were able to resist the effect on the spell, and undead were not affected at all.
