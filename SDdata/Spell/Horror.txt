'''''Horror''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that caused all opponents that could not resist to flee in extreme fear. It was similar to the ''[[fear]]'' spell, but did not operate in a cone shape, and could be cast by less-experienced [[wizard]]s.

|Pure horror is perhaps the greatest equalizer in existence, causing both the weakest and the strongest to lose their courage and flee in cowardice.

==Effects==
The [[mage]] could cast the spell up to 40 feet (12 meters) away. All enemies within a 30-foot (9.1 meter) radius would attempt to run away from the caster in fear. However, some were able to resist the effect on the spell, and [[undead]] were not affected at all.
