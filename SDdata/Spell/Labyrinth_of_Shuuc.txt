The '''Labyrinth of Shuuc''' was an extradimensional maze built by [[wizard]] named Shuuc to stash his magical treasures in.

==Exterior==
The location of the Labyrinth was unknown; however, its main entrance was the enchanted carpet with a woven image of a spiral staircase that descended into the depths of its [[silk]]en oriental designs. The carpet was much heavier than it seemed and it was {{SI|9'|'"|long=yes}} long, {{SI|4'|'"|long=yes}} wide. The patterns on the carpet appeared to shift and change in the light, despite its age and ruggedness. When unrolled, the carpet revealed the stairwell, and individuals could simply walk the stairs down into the extradimensional space. The gateway in the carpet only opened when it was unrolled in specific circumstances mandated by the Labyrinth's creator â€“ Shuuc. The magic carpet could not be used as a ''[[portable hole]]'' as it only opened the entrance into the maze in only a certain spot.

However, another entry existed. On [[Toril]], one could find an enchanted Labyrinth Map of Shuuc, presumably used by the maze's creator. The owner of the man could use it to transport themselves into Shuuc's maze, away from danger, later reemerging from it once the danger passed.{{Cite card/Spellfire: Master the Magic}}

==Interior==

When visitors descended down the spiraling staircase, they reach a stone wall at the base of the climb. The wall was a powerful ''[[illusion]]'', and visitors could walk through it. The entrance was located roughly at the center of the maze, and two treasure rooms were located in the southern and northern parts of the dungeon, behind ''illusory'' walls.

Each treasure room held a huge stone sarcophagus with several treasure chests inside. The sarcophagi lids were carved of massive slabs of ponderous stone.

The veering hallways of the dungeon had massive stone cubes that could be moved by exceptionally strong individuals. These blocks were used to seal off certain paths of the Labyrinth. These blocks were mechanisms affixed to the dungeon's wall and could only be pushed, never pulled. To make the maze even more confusing, the movable blocks were virtually indistinguishable from the dungeon's walls without magical aid.

==Defenses==
The only creatures that inhabited the Labyrinth of Shuuc were [[minotaur]]s who were locked in the extradimensional dungeon for decades with no food, leaving them ravenous, but alive as the creatures could survive for unnaturally long periods of time with no nourishment. The Minotaurs used the movable stone blocks to trap and slay invaders of their home. The beasts had keen senses, and they were momentarily aware of an intrusion.

==History==
[[File:The Labyrinth Map of Shuuc.png|thumb|''The Labyrinth Map of Shuuc, portable magic [[scroll]] allowing entrance.''|270x270px]]
Much of the Labyrinth was unknown. At one point, the treasure rooms of the extradimensional maze contained treasures of [[gold]], [[ivory]] statues, ''[[potion of speed]]'', a ''[[staff of command]]'', [[pearl]]s, [[quartz]], red [[spinel]]s, and an ''[[Apparatus of Kwalish]]''. The lone wizard Shuuc created the carpet using a [[ki-rin]]'s beard hair and [[phase spider]] silk, as well as [[chimera]] [[fleece]]. The minotaurs in his lair were mesmerized into servitude as he preferred the company of monsters.

There were several adventurers who claimed the carpet and found a way into the Labyrinth of Shuuc never to be seen after.
