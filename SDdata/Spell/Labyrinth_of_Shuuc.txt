The Labyrinth of Shuuc was an extradimensional maze built by wizard named Shuuc to stash his magical treasures in.
The location of the Labyrinth was unknown however, its main entrance was the enchanted carpet with a woven image of a spiral staircase that descended into the depths of its silken oriental designs. The carpet was much heavier than it seemed and it was  long,  wide. The patterns on the carpet appeared to shift and change in the light, despite its age and ruggedness. When unrolled, the carpet revealed the stairwell, and individuals could simply walk the stairs down into the extradimensional space. The gateway in the carpet only opened when it was unrolled in specific circumstances mandated by the Labyrinths creator â€“ Shuuc. The magic carpet could not be used as a portable hole as it only opened the entrance into the maze in only a certain spot.
However, another entry existed. On Toril, one could find an enchanted Labyrinth Map of Shuuc, presumably used by the mazes creator. The owner of the man could use it to transport themselves into Shuucs maze, away from danger, later reemerging from it once the danger passed.

Much of the Labyrinth was unknown. At one point, the treasure rooms of the extradimensional maze contained treasures of gold, ivory statues, potion of speed, a staff of command, pearls, quartz, red spinels, and an Apparatus of Kwalish. The lone wizard Shuuc created the carpet using a ki-rins beard hair and phase spider silk, as well as chimera fleece. The minotaurs in his lair were mesmerized into servitude as he preferred the company of monsters.
There were several adventurers who claimed the carpet and found a way into the Labyrinth of Shuuc never to be seen after.
