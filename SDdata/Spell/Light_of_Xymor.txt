Light of Xymor was a spell used against evil dragons. 
When casting this spell, the caster touched an item. The item then radiated a brilliant light and had the same effects and properties of daylight. Creatures who were harmed by natural light were vulnerable to this spell. Additionally, light of Xymor was a counter to many darkness-type spells, such as darkness or shadow of the dark queen. The most powerful effect of this spell was the any evil-aligned dragon or dragonkind creature were prevented from entering any area that the light touched. 
This spell required verbal and somatic components. Clerics and paladins of Bahamut cast this spell at a single level higher than their skill level.
