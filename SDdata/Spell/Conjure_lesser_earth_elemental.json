        "mainbody": "Conjure lesser earth elemental was a spell used by wizards that brought a native from the Elemental Plane of Earth to assist the caster.\nWhen cast, this spell summoned an earth elemental to serve the caster until the spell expired. The caster had to concentrate to maintain control of the creature. The spell always carried a certain risk that the conjured elemental would break free. If this occurred, the earth elemental became crazed and overcome with the need to bring violence upon the caster. The summoned earth elemental remained in this berserk-like state until it was banished back to the Plane of Earth, killed or the spell expired. Additionally, there was a small caster could regain control of the creature with a charm-based spell."
