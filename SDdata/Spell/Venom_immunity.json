        "mainbody": "Venom immunity was a necromancy spell used in the Underdark.\nThis spell rendered either the caster or recipient immune to all toxins for the duration of the spell. Unlike an antidote or the higher-level neutralize poison spell, venom immunity did not cure the target of their existing toxins.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components."
