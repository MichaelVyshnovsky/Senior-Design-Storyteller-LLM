A day in the life was a spell used by clerics of Yondalla.
When cast, this spell transformed a sentient living creature into a regular halfling. The now transformed individual retained their memories, mental faculties, personality and alignment. Any equipment or weapons carried by the individual before the transformation were not altered. Once transformed, the recipient was unable to cast spells or use psionic abilities. They returned to normal once the spell expired.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Yondalla and a single hair from the foot of a halfling.
