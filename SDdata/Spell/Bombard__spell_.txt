'''''Bombard''''' was a rare [[evocation]] spell of the [[southern magic]] tradition{{Southernmagic}} that bombarded a target with giant stones. 
==Effects==
The caster was able to bombard a single target within a {{SI|30|ft}} radius. The frequency of the bombardment was dependant on the caster's skill level. The spell expired if the target moved out of the range of the spell. ''[[Dispel magic]]'' would negate the spell, and creatures with magical resistance were somewhat protected from the effects of the spell. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], a single piece of meteoric iron.
