Bombard was a rare evocation spell of the southern magic tradition that bombarded a target with giant stones. 
The caster was able to bombard a single target within a  radius. The frequency of the bombardment was dependant on the casters skill level. The spell expired if the target moved out of the range of the spell. Dispel magic would negate the spell, and creatures with magical resistance were somewhat protected from the effects of the spell. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a single piece of meteoric iron.
