Create water was a spell specific to the desert regions of Zakhara, the Land of Fate and the Anauroch.
This spell created pure fresh or salt water at the casters discretion. The water would pour from the casters hands and simply flow away if not collected into containers. Up to  of water could be created with this spell. The caster could turn the flow of water off at any time, but could not restart it. The water did not pour from the casters hands with enough force to be used as a weapon. The water from this spell was permanent, but would of course evaporate like regular water.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a drop of the casters spittle or tears to cast.
