Detect living was a divine necromancy and divination spell used by specialty priests devoted to Jergal called Doomscribes.
This spell revealed the location of living things within a  sphere to the caster by marking them with an aura visible only to the caster. More intelligent creatures glowed with a brighter aura. The spell would mark targets that were even hidden by magical means.
The Scriveners of Doom developed this spell as a defense against ambush as well as to locate mortals attempting to flee from eternal rest.
This spell required only  verbal and somatic components to cast.
