Scalespray was a spell that could only be cast by dragons.
This spell allowed a dragon to turn the loose items in their lair into a projectile to attack opponents with. When cast, objects within the lair such as bones, coins, gems and shed scales were hurled towards a target. Any creature within a  radius were vulnerable to being struck by the improvised missiles.
The spell required only a verbal component.
