        "mainbody": "Undead torch was an evocation/necromancy spell that set a corporeal undead creature ablaze with a chilly flame that damaged living beings.\nUpon casting this spell, the targeted creature was engulfed in fire that damaged live creatures, but caused them no harm. The blue flames had a similar appearance to the \"chill\" effect created by a fire shield spell.\nThis spell had no effects on non-corporeal undead. Any affected corporeal undead creatures immediately nullified the effects of undead torch if they became non-corporeal.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the material component of a live or preserved firefly or glow worm.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
