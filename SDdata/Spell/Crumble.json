        "mainbody": "Crumble was a spell used by druids.\nWhen cast, this spell damaged artificial structures with rapid erosion. The spell also affected constructs but had no effect on creatures. The amount of damage caused by the erosion as well as the size of the structure the spell could target was determined by the casters spell level.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
