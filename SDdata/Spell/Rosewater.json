        "mainbody": "'''''Rosewater''''' was a [[divine]] [[alteration]] spell that transformed regular water into a substance beneficial to the clergy of [[Lathander]].",
        "Effects": "This spell changed a small volume of liquid, no larger than the head of the caster, into ''rosewater''. This rose-pink substance was similar to purified water when drunk by most people and was revitalizing when drunk by [[Lathander]]ian clergy and worshipers. It was caustic and harmful if imbibed by [[evil]] individuals.",
        "History": "This spell was inscribed within the holy [[relic]] called the ''[[Tome of the Morning]]''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the [[material component]]s of the cleric's [[holy symbol]] and two rose petals."
