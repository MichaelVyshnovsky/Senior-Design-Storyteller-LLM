        "Effect": "At the caster's behest, the ground would sprout tendrils of dark energy in a 10-foot (3 meter) radius. They would swing at the creatures in the area and harm them with their necrotic energies and hinder them. Only a test of strength would lessen the harm and not cause the creature to be hindered.",
        "Components": "The spell required verbal and somatic components."
