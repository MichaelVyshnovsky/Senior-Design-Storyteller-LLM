        "mainbody": "Arms of Hadar was a conjuration spell for warlocks that used the power of Hadar, the Dark Hunger,\nAt the casters behest, the ground would sprout tendrils of dark energy in a 10-foot (3 meter) radius. They would swing at the creatures in the area and harm them with their necrotic energies and hinder them. Only a test of strength would lessen the harm and not cause the creature to be hindered.\nThe spell required verbal and somatic components."
