        "mainbody": "Ghost rigging was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell created a ghostly rigging on a sailing vessel that functioned just as normal rigging did. This spell was often used to replace damaged rigging while at sea. The ghostly rigging matched the vessels needs.\nThis spell would not function when cast in the phlogiston.\nThis spell required a bit of canvass and string to cast."
