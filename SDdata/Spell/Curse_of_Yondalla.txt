The '''''curse of Yondalla''''' was an especially powerful [[abjuration]]/[[alteration]] [[spell]], granted only to followers of the [[Yondalla's Children|hin]] [[deity]] [[Yondalla]] and reserved only for use against creatures guilty of destroying a [[halfling]] community or slaying innocent and defenseless halflings.

==Effects==
When cast, any creature or person affected by the spell was stunned and, over the course of the next minute, reverted to a state of infancy, first slowly and then faster. [[Undead]] creatures without any sort of divinity were immediately destroyed while [[outsider|extraplanar]] creatures were banished to their home plane and unable to return for up to 100 years.

==Usage==
The resulting children were then brought up by a halfling community or the priest who cast the spell and taught to respect halflings. If the child was one of an inherently dangerous species, it was sent to foster parents who would be able to handle such a creature and raise it to have morals and ethics.

The only way to reverse the effects of this spell was for the cleric who cast it, or one more powerful than they, to cast a ''[[remove curse]]'' spell upon the infant. Otherwise, only a ''[[wish]]'' could dispel the effects. Destroyed undead creatures could also be brought back, but a banished outsider similarly required a successful ''wish'' spell or some form of divine intervention to return to [[Toril]].

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s and the use of the priest's [[holy symbol]].
