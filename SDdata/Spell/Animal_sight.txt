'''''Animal sight''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[priest]] to see through the eyes of a specific animal. It was regularly cast upon [[find companion|animal companions]], often to spy upon others or scout terrain before they ventured forth.

==Effects==
For a matter of minutes, depending on the skill and experience of the caster, the spellcaster could literally see through the eyes of any animal. It required complete concentration, to the point where they had to remain stationary during its duration.
