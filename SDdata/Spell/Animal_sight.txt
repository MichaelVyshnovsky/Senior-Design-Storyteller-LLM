Animal sight was an alteration spell that allowed a priest to see through the eyes of a specific animal. It was regularly cast upon animal companions, often to spy upon others or scout terrain before they ventured forth.
For a matter of minutes, depending on the skill and experience of the caster, the spellcaster could literally see through the eyes of any animal. It required complete concentration, to the point where they had to remain stationary during its duration.
