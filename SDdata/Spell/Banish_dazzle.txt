Banish dazzle was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by wizards.
Once this spell was cast the target could see clearly through blinding sunlight and heat shimmer. This spell also helped the target resist other spells directed at their eyes such as color spray, dazzle or fire charm. Reflected sunlight from a mirror had no effect on the target, and they were immune from being blinded by light spells.
This spell required a shard of glass, mica, gemstone, or clear crystal as a material component to cast. This shard was destroyed upon casting.
