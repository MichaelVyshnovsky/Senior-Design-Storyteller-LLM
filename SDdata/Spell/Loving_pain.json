        "mainbody": "Loving pain was a Loviatan healing spell that caused intense pain in the recipient.\nIt was often used by clerics of Loviatar to heal themselves of the wounds they acquired during their rituals.\nWhen this spell was cast, a single individual was healed of some of their wounds. They were also inflicted with a tremendous amount of pain, to the point they were left writhing and yelling out in agony.\nThe spell had no effect on creatures that did not have a nervous system.\nLoving pain was one of the spells whose specifications could be found within the Lash of Loviatar.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a single drop of unholy water and the clerics holy symbol."
