'''''Revenance''''' was a [[necromancy]] spell that boosted the fortitude of one or more [[undead]] creatures, making them immune to one successful ''turning''. An older version of this spell granted immunity for as many turning attempts as the caster had levels.

==Effects==
The two versions of this spell were quite different in effectiveness. Both protected undead creatures from what would normally be a successful turning by a [[cleric]], [[paladin]], or other holy person able to turn undead, but the older spell did so for as many attempts as the caster had levels, the newer spell only once. The older spell could be cast in much less than a minute and the caster had two minutes to touch each undead recipient, whereas the newer spell took 10 minutes to cast, during which the targets to be touched had to be within a 15 ft (4.6 m) radius. A novice necromancer able to cast this spell could grant immunity to 5 undead creatures. More experienced necromancers could effect greater numbers.

''Revenance'' did not grant immunity to magic items that affected undead, such as a ''[[mace of disruption]]''. However, the older version ''did'' grant immunity to ''[[protection from evil]]'', whereas the newer version did not. Only one ''revenance'' spell could be in effect on a creature at a time.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, casting the newer version of this spell required a smidgen of ash, dust, and blood. The older version required additional material components: a piece of bone, a stone, and some of the caster's spittle.

==History==
This spell was published in "[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]" and became generally known to the magical community.

==Rumor and Legends==
It was said that there existed a higher-level variant of this spell that could be used to create a powerful type of undead creature known as a [[revenant]].
