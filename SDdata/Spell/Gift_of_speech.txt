Gift of speech was a common spell used by druids. It was rarely used by clerics.
This spell allowed the caster to temporarily bestow on an animal the ability to speak. The caster choose the language during casting, and had to be one they could speak themselves. The targeted animal was capable of understanding spoken words and simple concepts. However, the spell did not actually increase the intelligence of the targeted animal.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of the caster.
