Permanency was a universal spell that made the effects of specific other spells permanent.
To achieve this, the caster simply cast the chosen spell and then cast the permanency spell immediately after. Moreover, the permanency only functioned for specific spells and the caster needed to have achieved a specific level of power with them. Casting permanency was personally taxing, permanently sapping the casters energy and experiences.
First, the caster could make these spells permanent when cast on him- or herself arcane sight, comprehend languages, darkvision, detect magic, read magic, see invisibility, and tongues. These permanent spells could be dispelled, but only by a more powerful spellcaster (compared to the caster at the time of casting permanency).
Second, the caster could make permanent on themself, a different creature, or an item the following spells, according to their function enlarge person, magic fang, greater magic fang, Rarys telepathic bond (only two creatures at a time), reduce person, and resistance. These could be dispelled as normal.
Finally, these spells that applied to items or areas could also be made permanent alarm, animate objects, dancing lights, ghost sound, gust of wind, invisibility, magic mouth, Mordenkainens private sanctum, phase door, prismatic sphere, prismatic wall, shrink item, solid fog, stinking cloud, symbol of death, symbol of fear, symbol of insanity, symbol of pain, symbol of persuasion, symbol of sleep, symbol of stunning, symbol of weakness, teleportation circle, wall of fire, wall of force, and web. These could be dispelled as normal.
It was possible to find other spells that could be made permanent, though the research was as time-consuming and costly as inventing the spell itself.
The Simbul had found a way to use permanency to place protection from evil on herself, despite the original spells limitation.
