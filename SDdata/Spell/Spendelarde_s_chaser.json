        "mainbody": "Spendelardes chaser was an arcane necromancy spell that alleviated pain and the undesirable side effects of drugs and alcohol, and provided significant protection against poisons.\nThis spell could be used on one creature no bigger than an ogre, and maintained its efficacy for at least an hour, or longer depending on the skill of the caster. All unwanted effects due to drugs and alcohol, such as nausea, headache, degraded eye/hand coordination, mental impairment, or unconsciousness, were instantly cured or restored by this spell.\nThis spell did not heal damage to the mind or body, did not work against magical curses or effects, and did nothing for insanity&mdashit merely assisted the metabolism to remove foreign chemicals.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a drop of holy water which had to be applied to the tongue or skin of the recipient.\nSpendelard originally created this spell as a cure for hangovers, and its protection against poison was discovered later.\nCategoryNecromancy spells\nCategorySpendelardes spells\nCategoryWizard spells\n6hokougfy1uo3d44flz2rlwcmcz08fw"
