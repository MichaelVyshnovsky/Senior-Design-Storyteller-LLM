        "mainbody": "'''''Wood sword''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Mielikki]], enabling them to create a temporary weapon. It was also available to priests of [[Gwaeron Windstrom]].",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to create a temporary weapon out of a small piece of wood. It took the form of a [[sword]] and was relatively pliant, but could be broken by a chopping weapon or if caught between hard objects such as a closing door. The caster could wield the weapon in their hand or direct the ''wood sword'' to attack chosen targets by itself until the spell ended (at least 10 minutes or more for experienced users) or the [[sword]] contacted flame. The sword would vanish if the caster began to cast another spell. The ''wood sword'' could not damage nonliving wood, stone or metal. It could also be used for delicate procedures such as stirring a pot or moving or carrying items from afar, provided not too much weight was put upon it.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a twig, branch, or other piece of wood that still had some bark on it that was unchanged since it fell or was broken from a tree to cast. That is, the wood could not be stained, painted, varnished, or cut or shaped by tools.",
        "History": "It was recorded in ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy text of the [[church of Mielikki]].<ref>"
