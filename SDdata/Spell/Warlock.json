        "mainbody": "The most frequent provider of pacts to [[tiefling]] and [[half-fiend]] warlocks, even before his rise to true divinity, was [[Asmodeus]], Lord of the [[Nine Hells]]. He spent a great effort maintaining pacts, and thus influence on other planes, for it allowed him to cement his position as the greatest of the archdevils. Contesting Asmodeus in the frequency of pact-making and for control of these mortals was [[Mephistopheles]], his chief rival. After them, the most frequent employer of the infernal pact was [[Glasya]], Asmodeus's daughter, Regardless, most archdevils (the stronger dukes of Hell included) made some pacts, including the the archdevil turned [[demigod]] [[Gargauth]]. [[Demon lord]]s of the [[Abyss]] also granted infernal pacts, such as [[Demogorgon]], [[Orcus]], [[Baphomet]], [[Fraz-Urb'luu]], or [[Eltab]]. There were also [[yugoloth#yugoloth lords|yugoloth lords]], such as the fallen [[solar]] [[Malkizid]] who would do so.\n\nThese warlocks may have lost much from their bargains with fiends, but gained great power in return. Warlocks wielding the powers of the Nine Hells could turn the life force of enemies against them, and even master the [[Hellfire|fires of Hell]] for their own purposes. They gained supernatural resilience to the elements over time and learned how to launch their foes through the Lower Planes, fracturing their psyche in the process.\n\n===Star Pact, ''the Great Old One''===\n[[Image:Star pact warlock.jpg|thumb|250px|''A warlock who forged a pact with an [[elder evil]].'']]\n{{Main|Great Old One patron}}\nSo-called star pact warlocks forged their arcane alliances with the unknowable and alien forces, generally those of the [[Far Realm]].{{Cite dragon/366/Wish Upon a Star|17-25}}\n\nIn some cases, star pact warlocks were unaware of how strongly these stars were connected to the dark powers of the Far Realm and were guided to their pact through haunting nightmares. Such warlocks might have viewed the source of their powers as innocent or at the very least under their control. Others were fully aware of the connection and exploited it anyway, either due to insanity or sheer ambition. Still others viewed these pacts, if they were even aware of them, with an even higher degree of suspicion than normal warlocks warranted, since the aberrant powers of the Far Realm were more horrific than any devil or fey spirit.\n\nRegardless of their motivations or even awareness about the nature of their powers, star pact warlocks gained much from such alliances, including degrees of prescience and powerful spells infused with radiant energy that inspired fear in the warlock's enemies. The most basic of these invocations was ''[[dire radiance]]'', which caused a piercing ray of life to burn a warlock’s enemy with pain and fear. Eldritch patrons were also known to bestow a boon on their warlocks which allowed them to glimpse the future by cursing and harnessing the life energy of others. \n\nExperienced warlocks of the star pact could became [[doomsayer]]s, who spread fear through their powerful magic, or [[student of Caiphon|students of Caiphon]], apostles of the powerful elder evil that spoke through the ancient star. Star warlocks who continued this path may have become a [[radiant one]], beings who mastered the power of the [[Far Realm]] and became [[aberration]]s.\n\n===Undying Pact, ''the Undying''===\n{{Main|Undying patron}}\nWarlocks of the undying pact formed a union with some eternal being that had achieved immortality during their mortal life. Some of the well-known undying pact patrons in Faerûn included [[Larloch]], the [[lich]] who was referred to as the Shadow King and [[Gilgeam]], the returned God-King of [[Unther]].\n\nThese warlocks were able to cast away the needs of their mortal body and slow the effects of aging. They became partially indestructible by physical means, and could readily restore any limbs that may have become unattached.\n\n===Other Pacts===\nDetails of other pacts are sparse but it was known that some warlocks have been found in the service of other lords. For instance, during the Era of Upheaval, a number of genasi warlocks found their way into the service of a [[fire elemental]] known as [[Sthes'kthes]]. Although unlikely to be bound of [[Hanali Celanil]] by pact, some celadrin warlocks had also been known to serve the [[deity|goddess]] as [[cleric]]s and [[eldritch theurge]]s. Additionally, a number of worghest warlocks were at one time bound to the [[barghest]] [[Tarkomang]] as his servants.",
        "Culture": "{{Quote|''I've known a few warlocks in my time. Talented, of course, though sometimes too eager to listen to the devils on their shoulders. Comes with the territory, unfortunately.''|[[Gale Dekarios]] of [[Waterdeep]]}}<br/>\nWarlocks had an overall poor reputation, a result of their dealings with otherworldly and often malevolent [[outsider]]s. However, not all warlocks were evil, and many used their deadly gifts for benign purposes, but even so, they were regarded with skepticism. How far the warlock went to fulfilling their pact was entirely up to them, though all warlocks eventually favored one pact over all the others lest their patrons take offense.\n\n[[File:Warlock_Class.png|thumb|right|200px|Some warlocks' powers came from dark and ancient sources.]]\nLike [[sorcerer]]s, many warlocks came from a supernatural bloodline, and it had been said that warlocks were \"born, not made.\" This was not true for all warlocks, though many did indeed come from [[fey]] or [[fiend]]ish bloodlines.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Warlocks, Part 1}} Those that weren't were still often touched by destiny in some special way, sought out by powerful extraplanar forces as tools and minions, altering their souls and giving them supernatural abilities beyond the ken of most mortals. Regardless of how they treated their patrons, most warlocks had a healthy respect for the divine, particularly patrons of magical power such as [[Corellon]] or [[Selûne]], though many evil warlocks were drawn to [[Asmodeus]] and [[Cyric]] as well. There were exceptions, however. Some warlocks sought out good gods deliberately to counter the powerful temptations they dealt with regularly. Other warlocks felt no ties to the gods, perhaps due to their frequent dealings with other supernatural powers.\n\n[[Tiefling]]s and others of fiendish blood were powerfully drawn to the ways of the warlock and were among the most common to take the path. [[Human]]s, thanks in large part to their capacity for ambition, also bred many warlocks, hoping to find a path to power that did not take them a significant portion of their short lifespans. [[Half-orc]]s were also commonly warlocks, in part because the powers that chose to give patronage to warlocks did not discriminate between them and other, more \"purebred\", races. Other [[planetouched]], particularly [[fey'ri]], [[genasi]], and [[worghest]]s, but [[celadrin]], as well as [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadar-kai]] and [[star elf|star elves]], were also often drawn to forge warlock pacts, the latter due in part to the chaotic and troubled energies which filled [[Sildëyuir]]. Warlocks from other races were far more rare, though [[halfling]]s and [[half-elf|half-elves]], when given the incentive, made excellent practitioners of the dark arts.\n\nWarlocks had varying views of those who differ from them, in part because of their outsider place in society. Generally, warlocks viewed other arcane spellcasters through a lens of bitter rivalry, and likewise [[wizard]]s tended to view warlocks as those who tainted the reputation of [[the Art]]. Warlocks generally had a healthy respect for [[fighter]]s' strength or [[rogue]]s' cleverness, but few got along well with practitioners of [[divine magic]], in part due to their dealings with unholy powers. Even so, warlocks rarely tried to deliberately upset allies who could have proven useful, which included [[cleric]]s.",
        "Abilities": {
            "Pact Boons": "Warlocks were apt to receive gifts from their patrons in exchange for or expectation of loyal service. In some cases, these were potent or hexing abilities determined by the patron while other times a warlock might get to choose a gift, and such a choice could come to define the nature of the warlock's pact. The primary gift options offered to warlocks were the [[Pact of the Chain]], in which the warlock was granted the ability to [[Find familiar|summon a familiar]]; the [[Pact of the Blade]], in which they gained the ability to summon and shape a pact weapon; and the [[Pact of the Tome]], in which they were bestowed a [[grimoire]] known as a [[Book of Shadows (pact boon)|Book of Shadows]] containing additional spells.",
            "Eldritch Invocations": "Another gift bestowed to Warlocks from their patrons were [[Eldritch Invocations]], fragments of forbidden knowledge with a wide variety of effects from granting the Warlock access to new spells they would not normally have access to (and for some, the ability to cast them with unlimited frequency instead of a limited number of uses per day), improving their aptitude with their Pact Boon in various ways, and multiple different methods of enhancing the ''[[eldritch blast]]'' spell to a level far beyond what other spellcasters could normally achieve. Vastly improved range, damage, and the ability to knock-back or pull opponents have all been witnessed in the ''eldritch blasts'' of a warlock."
        },
        "Warlock Pacts": {
            "Celestial Pact": "[[File:Celestial patron warlock-5e.jpg|right|200px|''A celestial pact warlock.'']]\n{{Main|Celestial patron}}\nWhile many warlocks forged pacts with powers of the [[Lower planes]], some preferred to bargain with the benevolent entities of the [[upper planes]]. They were touched by the holy energy of powerful celestial beings and their personalities reflected as such. Warlocks with celestial patrons were often driven to rid the world of [[undead]] or other [[fiend]]ish beings, or possessed intense longing to travel to their patron's home within the heavens.\n\nThe magic they wielded was a shining reflection of what was possessed by their patron. Celestial warlocks gained access to powerful restorative spells along with others that allowed them to annihilate the forces of darkness. Over time, the bond with their patron allowed them to channel [[positive energy]] through their bodies and bolster their life force. Even the threat of impending death could not keep a celestial pact warlock from acting as a mortal conduit for the powers above.",
            "Dark Pact": "[[Image:Dark pact warlock.jpg|left|thumb|175px|''A warlock who dealt with powers of the drow.'']]\nDark pact warlocks forged some of the most dangerous pacts of all, both morally and physically, through foul alliances with [[Lolth]] and other entities of [[drow]] civilization. It is this latter connection from which the dark pact gained its name and much of its tradition. Those drow that did not choose the path of the wizard or the [[fighter]] took on the role of the warlock. In spite of its roots amongst the xenophobic drow, this tradition of dealing with the dark forces of the [[Underdark]] slowly moved towards the surface world. \n\nThese warlocks gained powers reflecting the pain, poison, and madness inherent in the Underdark. Dark pact warlocks were also granted a boon known as a ''darkspiral aura'', which enabled them to feed off death in battle to create more and more powerful eldritch spells. Invocations of the dark pact were almost always fueled by the strong willpower required of such warlocks. The most basic spell of the dark pact warlock was ''[[spiteful glamor]]'', which allowed the warlock to strike into the mind of his or her foe, wracking them with terrible pain.\n\nTruly powerful dark pact warlocks may have become [[darkwalker]]s, who immersed themselves so fully in the dark forces with whom they bargained that they became ghostlike and insubstantial.",
            "Fey Pact, ''the Archfey''": "{{Main|Archfey patron}}\n[[File:Feywild_Trickster.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Fey pact warlocks were often more whimsical and playful rather than grim and edgy.]]\nFey pact warlocks, which were among the fewest in number of all warlocks, forewent the obvious dangers of dealing with [[devil]]s or the forbidding mystery that surrounds the star pact but instead dealt with powerful, supernatural forces of the [[Feywild]]. Such spirits of the natural world may have been menacing or simply capricious in their dealings with mortals of the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Some were [[faerie]]-like [[dryad]]s or [[sylphs]] while others were less easily defined, more like incarnations of nature than anything else. Many of the sponsors of warlocks who sought the fey pact were dangerous [[archfey]], such as the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]] or other such [[Unseelie]] fey,\n\nThe magic bestowed upon fey pact warlocks could be enchanting, while retaining the savage lethality common to the Feywild. Often such invocations required the wielder to have a high level of natural presence and charm, with which they could hold their own in negotiations with the wily and often deceptive beings. The most basic of these, known to all of the fey pacts, was ''[[eyebite]]'', which caused its victim to lose sight of their attacker under the weight of staggering psychic pain. Fey patrons were also known to bestow a boon to their warlocks which allowed them to use an ability similar to ''[[misty step]]''. Additionally, fey pact warlocks with a measure of fey blood may also have demonstrated a natural affinity for flora and fauna, allowing them to have located hidden wildlife with relative ease.\n\nWarlocks who focused all their attention on dealing with fey spirits might have become one of the [[feytouched]], half-mad spellcasters who slipped between the [[Feywild]] and the [[Prime Material Plane]] as they wished. Some of the best-known organizations of fey pact warlock included the [[Lakh-Myr Thorns]], who, during the [[Era of Upheaval]], were headed by a shadar-kai named [[Gaen Ral]], as well as the [[Tairemgira]] of [[Kryptgarden Forest]]. While most fey pact warlocks sided with the Unseelie, a few came under the patronage of more benevolent beings, such as the archfey [[Titania]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Warlocks, Part 1}}",
            "Hexblade Pact": "[[File:Hired Hexblade AFR.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A drow hexblade hiring themself out as a mercenary.'']]\n{{Main|Hexblade}}\n[[Hexblade]] warlocks forged pacts with an obscure entity of the [[Shadowfell]]. It was speculated by sages that this unknown power was in fact the [[Raven Queen]], as she had made the first of their weapons and thus all hexblade warlocks and their weapons were in her service. Either way, this entity manifested as a [[sentient item|sentient weapon]] made of [[shadowstuff]]—''[[Blackrazor]]'' was the most notorious of these—and made promises of power to those with whom it would enter into pacts. Many hexblade warlocks of the [[Prime Material plane]] forged their own weapons based on this shady blade, while others more simply incorporated shadowy magic into their own arcane powers.\n\nAll hexblades learned how to properly arm themselves for war, channeling the shadowy power of their patron into their chosen weapon. They developed the means to curse their foes, making them weaker and more vulnerable to harm. Over time, these warlocks learned how to cull the [[spirit]]s of those they slew, and transfer the curse from their corpse to another unfortunate soul.",
            "Infernal Pact, ''the Fiend''": "{{Main|Fiend patron}}\n[[File:Impfamiliar.jpg|thumb|left|245x245px|A warlock's [[imp]] familiar.]]\nWarlocks of the infernal pact, the most commonly sworn of all the pacts, were those who forged dealings with powerful [[fiend]]s from the [[Lower Planes]]. Such was the ubiquity of this arrangement that the term \"warlock\" in Faerun was almost synonymous with infernal power. The majority of those who made such pacts were evil, but some rare exceptions strove against the wicked aims of their patron even as their fiendish benefactor sought their own corruption or destruction. Some warlocks of the infernal pact sought forbidden knowledge given to the mortal world by devils but since forgotten over time.\n\nA wide variety of fiendish beings could offer infernal pacts ranging from mere [[cambion]]s to powerful embodiments of evil like [[pit fiend]]s, [[balor]]s, and [[ultroloth]]s.The 4{{th}} edition [[Player's Handbook 4th edition|Player's Handbook]] limited warlocks to take patrons only from the [[Nine Hells]] and not from the [[Abyss]]. The 5{{th}} edition [[Player's Handbook 5th edition|Player's Handbook]] expanded this to include the entirety of the [[Lower Planes]]. In addition to their thematic similarities, the two iterations include the shared ability 'Dark One's Blessing'. While the term \"infernal\" refers only the [[devil]]ish concerns originating from the Nine Hells, for the purposes of this article the 'Infernal Pact' is considered relatively synonymous with 'the Fiend' warlock patron. Such pacts were not always struck directly or knowingly, as fiendish patrons were known to work through intermediaries. Of all the fiendish pacts, the most common and the representative majority among warlocks were those made with [[archdevil]]s. No likely patrons were as enthusiastic about making them, for they enjoyed corrupting and controlling the mortals of Faerun.\n\n{{Quote\n|A pact is a tool, not a damnation.\n|Farideh{{Cite MTG|AFR|221|{{MTGc|Farideh, Devil's Chosen||AFR|#=221}}|[[Magali Villeneuve]]}}\n}}\n\nThe most frequent provider of pacts to [[tiefling]] and [[half-fiend]] warlocks, even before his rise to true divinity, was [[Asmodeus]], Lord of the [[Nine Hells]].

            "Deceptive Warlocks": "Deceptive warlocks preferred guile to sheer power and typically trained themselves in spells that may have been less immediately lethal, but which could cause any number of unpleasant side effects. For this reason, deceptive warlocks were less likely to be found in the thick of the fighting, using long-range invocations instead. These warlocks often had a very strong force of personality, which they channeled into their spells for additional power. Many were also highly intelligent, cunning which allowed them to often use their invocations in more effective ways. Deceptive warlocks were most likely to hold themselves to powerful [[archfey]] or aberrations.",
            "Scourge Warlocks": "Preferring raw power to subtlety, scourge warlocks were tougher than the average warlock, possessing a powerful constitution, which often superseded their intellect and charisma. Scourge warlocks fostered this capacity for endurance purposefully, channeling their vitality into the deadly invocations they wielded. This came at the cost of often endangering oneself, either in close combat or through the sheer lethality of their powers, but scourge warlocks were typically more than capable of wielding their dangerous spells safely.
