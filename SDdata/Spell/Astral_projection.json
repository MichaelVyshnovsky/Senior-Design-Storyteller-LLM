        "mainbody": "Astral projection was a necromancy spell that projected the caster and a number of companions into the Astral Plane. This spell was sometimes called the astral spell and was considered a member of the alteration school.\nThe spell created a projection of the casters body and up to eight additional willing creatures in the Astral Plane, leaving their physical bodies behind in a state of magically suspended animation. The projections carried all of their owners possessions at the time of casting and were essentially identical to their physical bodies. While the spell lasted, the travelers souls remained tethered to their physical bodies via a silver cord that trailed behind the astral form, departing from its shoulder blades and remaining visible for only .\nThe astral form could travel freely through the Astral and pass through portals normally. Upon entering another plane, a new body formed at the destination, with the travelers soul and equipment transported to the new form via the silver cord.\nThe spell could last indefinitely, until the caster dismissed it, in which case all companions safely returned to the Prime Material plane, or until a dispel magic was cast on an astral form or physical body, thereby ending the effect for that particular traveler.\nIf an astral form was killed, the soul also returned to its owners physical body via the silver cord.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The materials required were a jacinth valued at 1,000 gp or more and a silver bar worth 5 gp per person to be taken along. After the Second Sundering the jade price remained the same but the ornately carved silver bar had to be worth at least 100 gp. All material components were consumed when the spell was cast.\nAt the time of casting, the willing companions needed to remain in a circle formation together with the caster.\nParticularly powerful monks were capable of astral projecting by channeling their ki. They could do so without the need of any material components, but could take no companions with them.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Valdick in  and was originally called Valdicks astral form."
