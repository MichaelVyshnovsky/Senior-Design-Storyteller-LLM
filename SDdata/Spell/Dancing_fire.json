        "mainbody": "'''''Dancing fire''''' was a [[spell]] that was first developed by the [[phaerimm]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell created a horizontal arc of fire, {{SI|12|ft}} in length, that floated in the air. This arc was mobile, moving slowly in a direction determined by the caster until the spell expired. If the arc of fire encountered a solid barrier that was non-combustible, such as a solid rock face, the spell expired. If it encountered a combustible barrier, such as a wooden wall, it burned through and continued on its way. The movement of the arc could not be slowed down.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components."
