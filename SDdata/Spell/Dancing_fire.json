        "mainbody": "Dancing fire was a spell that was first developed by the phaerimm.\nWhen cast, this spell created a horizontal arc of fire,  in length, that floated in the air. This arc was mobile, moving slowly in a direction determined by the caster until the spell expired. If the arc of fire encountered a solid barrier that was non-combustible, such as a solid rock face, the spell expired. If it encountered a combustible barrier, such as a wooden wall, it burned through and continued on its way. The movement of the arc could not be slowed down.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
