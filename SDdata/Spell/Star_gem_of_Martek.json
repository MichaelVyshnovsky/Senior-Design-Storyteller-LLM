        "History": "The wizard [[Martek]] had foreseen the need for the gems in order to completely defeat Khalitharius, and thus hid them throughout the [[Raurin]].

The Star of Shah-Pelar, he gave to an unnamed pharaoh of the desert, before it was stolen by [[Badr Al-Mosak]]. The Star of Aga-Pelar, he used to personally bind [[Khalitharius]], giving it then to the Lord of [[Pazar]] to keep the efreet prisoner. Martek hid the Star of Melos-Pelar in the ruins of Medinat Muskawoon, and the Star of Shah-Pelar in an abandoned temple beneath the [[Oasis of the White Palm]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|5}}",
