'''''Holy power''''' was strengthening [[spell]] from the [[evocation]] school of magic, used by [[divine]] spellcasters as well as by [[Painbearer]]s of [[Ilmater]].

==Effects==
This divine magic allowed the caster to channel the power of their deity and temporarily strengthen their bodies. ''Holy power'' improved the caster's aim and the amount of damage they could deal to the target. The power of this spell grew along with the [[cleric]]'s or [[paladin]]'s proficiencies and experience.
