        "mainbody": "'''''Rainbow''''' was a minor [[illusion]] [[cantrip]] that [[illusionist]]s-in-training could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It created a ribbon of striped colors that could move and form various shapes.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip formed a long ribbon of softly shining colors that exactly resembled a [[wikipedia:Rainbow|rainbow]]. The illusion was {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} long, {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} wide, and at least one end of the band had to be within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the caster upon creation. This spell lasted for one minute and then the illusion faded away. The caster could choose the shape of the bow and let it remain in place for the duration of the spell (allowing the caster to move out of range), or cause it to move, twist, and turn, manipulating it with hand gestures, while staying within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of it. The illusion gave off a soft, rainbow-hued glow that was visible in non-magical darkness. Creatures that saw the ''rainbow'' and did not resist the spell had their gaze drawn to the image for a few seconds. A moving ''rainbow'' had a chance to hold their attention a few seconds longer than a stationary one.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster formed a triangular pyramid with the fingers of both hands while speaking a name of power, such as ''gar-land'' or ''pegee-lee''.These are references to [[imdb:Judy Garland|Judy Garland]] who famously sang ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow'' and [[imdb:Peggy Lee|Peggy Lee]] who sang the lullaby ''Sing a Rainbow''."
