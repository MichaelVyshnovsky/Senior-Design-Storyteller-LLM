        "mainbody": "'''''Treasure scent''''' was a [[spell]] that allowed the caster to smell valuables.",
        "Effects": "On casting ''treasure scent'', the caster was surrounded by a metallic glow of various colors that went into the caster's nose. The caster then became able to smell valuables. What counted as valuables were [[gem]]s, [[copper]], [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[platinum]]. but wind direction and intensity could help or hinder detection. If the caster was downwind of the treasure, the range increased to 60 ft (18 m); upwind reduced it to 15 ft (4.6 m); an open chest full of coins could be smelled at double these ranges; a [[dragon]] hoard at triple range. Those with skill at tracking could use this new sense to track a creature carrying valuables, but success became more difficult with every passing hour.",
        "Components": "The spell only required only somatic and verbal components."
