'''''Wardmist''''' was a [[spell]] that created a permanent, magical mist in a set location. This mist lowered the range of regular vision within the affected area, protected it from [[magic]]al and [[psionic]] [[scrying]] and could provide guardians in the form of [[undead]] monsters.

==Effects==
The primary effects of the spell included the protection from [[divination]] as well as a magical fog that reduced vision as if those inside were in complete darkness. Light from natural sources would lower the effects of the fog's turbidity, but not remove it entirely.

Entry into and out of a ''wardmist'' was never inhibited, but people entering its area would be warned by a light or noise radiating from within the mist. Those who carried ''[[ward token]]s'', a uniquely stamped emblem of a metal specified upon casting, would not perceive the mist at all. The specifications of these tokens would be set at the spell's casting, but they could be freely produced afterwards.

Any creature without a token would be seen as intruders by the magic of the ''wardmist'' and would unknowingly warn the caster and trigger any ''[[contingency|contingencies]]'' or ''[[spell trigger]]s'' set upon the affected area. These spells could provide extra protection for the area, per the caster's specifications. Even without these magics, the spell ''wardmist'' extended its protection of the area beyond scrying effects via undead guardians. 

===Guardians===
Upon designation of a region to be protected by ''wardmist'' the caster, or casters combining their effort, would enclose an space, hundreds of feet in area. Undead guardians could be linked to the affected area upon casting, being released from a stasis when intruders enter or linger in the area of the mist. These guardians included [[zombie]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[bonebat]]s, [[watchghost]]s, [[wraith]]s, [[blazing bones]], [[helmed horror]]s or [[baneguard]]s.

==Magic==
If a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell was cast within a ''wardmist'' it would increase visibility within the area of affect. The only way to destroy the effects of the spell was through use of a ''[[wish]]'' spell.

==Components==
The material component for ''wardmist'' was a lump of [[silver]] larger than the fist of the caster, the silk of a [[phase spider]], powdered [[amber]] worth no less than 500 [[gp]]. Additional components would be required if ''contingencies'' or ''spell triggers'' were linked with its casting.

==Notable Uses==
The [[Cloister of St. Ramedar]] had a specially designed ''wardmist'' guarding the windows to the cells.
