        "mainbody": "Create darkness was an arcane alteration spell that extinguished all nonmagical light.\nThis spell could also extinguish light given off from magical sources if the source was unable to resist the spells magic. A normal light source affected by create darkness could not be relit for one hour, while magical sources stood a chance of being relit every ten minutes.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThis was an uncommon spell used by drow and other spellcasters of the Underdark."
