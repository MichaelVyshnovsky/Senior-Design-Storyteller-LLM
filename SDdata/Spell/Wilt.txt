'''''Wilt''''' was a reversed version of the ''[[freshen]]'' [[cantrip]] that apprentice [[wizard]]s could learn,{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} but was limited to only vegetable matter, and therefore, it was a unique spell. ''Wilt'' caused rapid aging of a plant or small amount of vegetable material.

==Effects==
This cantrip only worked on one plant about the size of a bouquet of flowers, or the same amount of cut vegetable matter. It did not affect [[plant creature]]s. When cast, leaves drooped, flowers faded, stems sagged, and fruit aged. If the target was already showing signs of decay, ''wilt'' caused further withering.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The index finger was held pointing upward, then the caster hummed a quick, descending note while curling the forefinger.

==History==
The untitled book known as ''[[Briel's Book of Shadows]]'' described this cantrip along with ''[[exterminate]]'', ''[[tie]]'', and ''[[smokepuff]]''.{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|34}}<ref group="note">The four cantrips described in [[Dragon magazine 97|''Dragon'' #97]] were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''.
