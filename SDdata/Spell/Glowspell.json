        "mainbody": "'''''Glowspell''''' was a [[spell]] that summoned forth a drifting cloud radiance that remained lit for a set period of time.",
        "Effects": "''Glowspells'' were a good alternative no regular and [[enchanted]] [[oil]] [[lamp]]s, providing gentle illumination when conjured.",
        "History": "The spell was known as far back as the {{YearlinkName|759}}. A [[Banite]] [[sorceress]] [[Dasumia]] of [[Galadorna]], who once tutored [[Elminster Aumar]], used ''glowspells'' to illuminate her home and its balconies.\n\nAs of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], drifting ''glowspell'' clouds were used to illuminate the streets of [[Athkatla]]'s glittering [[Athkatla/Gem District|Gem District]]. like many other cities, Athkatla did not used ensorcelled oil lamps or magical globes of light."
