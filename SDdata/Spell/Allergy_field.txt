Allergy field was an uncommon spell for rangers and rarely used by druids.
When cast, this spell triggered plants to produce allergens and antigens such as pollen. It affected a minimum area of  per side, and this area increased as the caster grew more skilled. It was often cast in areas with abundant plant life such as forests and meadows. Any creature within the area of effect experienced severe allergies, including sneezing, headaches and swelling around the eyes. The caster determined the duration of the spell, but the first frost would break the spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a small amount of ragweed.
