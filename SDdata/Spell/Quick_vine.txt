Quick vine was an arcane spell used by witch doctors of the Malatran Plateau through spell fetishes rather than spellbooks.
When cast, quick vine summoned a vine that sprouted from the spell fetish that contained the spell. The quickly-growing vine was  thick and could grow longer the more powerful the spellcaster was. The vine grew with the speed of  her second and up to  in its shortest form. The vine could attach itself to any non-slippery surface and support up to  in weight, making the vine stronger as the spellcaster grew in magical power. The summoned vine could not be controlled by the caster apart from pointing it in a general direction. Quick vine could not enable a living creature.
The quick vine spell demanded verbal and material components to be cast. Its material components were a  long vine that disappeared as the spell was cast, and is spell fetish that was not consumed by the spell.
