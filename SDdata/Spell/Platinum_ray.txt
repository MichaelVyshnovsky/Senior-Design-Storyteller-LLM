Platinum ray was a spell used against evil dragons. 
When cast, a radiant platinum ray, representing the strength of good dragons, shot out from the caster to a target. When used against an evil dragon, the spell suppressed their innate magical abilities. 
This spell required verbal and somatic components. Clerics of Bahamut were capable of casting this spell at a stronger level.
