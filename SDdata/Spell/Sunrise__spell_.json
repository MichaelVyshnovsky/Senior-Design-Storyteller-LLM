        "mainbody": "'''''Sunrise''''' was a [[spell]] that was commonly used by [[cleric]]s of [[Lathander]].",
        "Effects": "A caster used this spell to create a brilliant sphere of sunlight around them. This spell inflicted both confusion and damage to [[undead]] creatures such as [[vampire]]s as well as [[:Category:Fungi|fungi]]-based creatures, [[mold]]s, and [[slime]]s. Creatures with [[infravision]] lost that ability temporarily as a result of the light. The caster was able to delay the spell until triggered by an activation word or force of will. The caster could also surround another creature with the light; to do so, they were required to be in physical contact during casting. The spell was vulnerable to ''[[dispel magic]]''. This spell was able to counter some darkness-based spells.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: a seed from an aster and a piece of [[sunstone (gem)|sunstone]]. It also required a [[divine focus]]."
