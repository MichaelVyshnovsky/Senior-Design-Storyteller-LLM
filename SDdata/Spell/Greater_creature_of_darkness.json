        "mainbody": "Greater creature of darkness was a spell used by clerics of Shar.\nWhen cast, this spell conjured a creature of darkness. The creature of darkness took the shape of a human and moved about in an upright bipedal fashion. It floated, never actually touching the ground. The creature of darkness was not sentient and was controlled by the caster, and could see through the \"eyes\" of the creature. While seeing through the eyes of the creature of darkness, the caster was not vulnerable to gaze-based spells and attacks. However, the vision was not clear enough to see in detail or read. The body of the creature of darkness was opaque, no one could see though the shadowy form, and even magical means such as light or continual light could not penetrate the creature of darkness.\nThe creature of darkness could become semi-solid when needed. It could carry up to  in weight. It could wield weapons, use magical items, make deliveries and open doors. The caster could even use touch-based spells through the creature of darkness.\nAn individual could actually walk though the creature of darkness, cloaking them. The caster could command the creature of darkness to move with an individual within. And if the individual who entered the creature of darkness was an enemy, the caster could attack via a touched-based spell. Any individual within the creature of darkness could see though it clearly. Those casting this spell usually entered the creature of darkness themselves. While within the creature of darkness, the caster was immune to bright lights, hypnotic effects, and illusion-based spells. While within, the caster could use one of two effects provided by the creature of darkness. They could either use the creature of darkness as feather fall or levitate for a short period of time. Once the caster used either of these effects, the spell expired.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required several material components. It required the web of a spider, a small amount of either pitch or soot, a piece of a shell that was dyed black or burned in a fire. The caster could substitute the shell with either a beak or a bone, also dyed black. Finally, the spell required a piece of any flying creature, such as a feather, a piece of skin or a scale.\nDark road was one of the spells found in Gorothirs Girdle, a holy text of the church of Shar."
