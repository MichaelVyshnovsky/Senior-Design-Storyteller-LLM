A '''spellscar''' was a mark or scar on an individual who was exposed to the [[Spellplague]]. It was a mild form of [[plaguechanged|plaguechange]] that had the potential to grant unique [[magical]] powers to the afflicted individual. Such individuals were referred to as '''spellscarred''', and [[Spellscarred (class)|some among them]] trained to master their powers.

==Description==
While spellscars could sometimes include physical abnormalities or injuries&mdash;such as blue scar tissue or strange [[rune]]s on the skin&mdash;they were not necessarily accompanied by the types of bodily and mental deformities seen in other victims of the Spellplague. More commonly, they were invisible and intangible until activated, at which point they were characterized by a blue glow or blue flames. These flames might appear as jagged cracks on the skin, symbols or brands on the face, or even as halos or wings. 

Spellscars were charged with powerful [[arcane]] energy. While there were some who strove to master their spellscars, activating them and using their power as they saw fit, to debilitating pain, although the blue flames of a spellscar did not burn or seriously injure the afflicted individual.

}}Acquiring a spellscar was the result of coming into contact with the Spellplague, Only some plaguechanged individuals acquired a spellscar: and more commonly in those who had come into contact with less virulent versions of the Spellplague's energies In some cases, a spellscar could manifest many years after an individual was exposed to the Spellplague, or even in people who had never come into direct contact with the Spellplague, although these were usually arcane spellcasters of some kind. Spellscars could also be inherited from a parent or ancestor, sometimes skipping one or more generations before reappearing.

}}The first appearance or emergence of a spellscar could be traumatizing. The event was sometimes accompanied by an eruption of [[plaguefire]] that disfigured the spellscarred individual and others nearby, or in some cases, caused the destruction of people and places in the immediate vicinity. Individuals who experienced such a catastrophic awakening of their spellscar were known as '''spellscarred harbingers''', and were often feared and hated for the destruction that they had unintentionally caused.

While any creature could become spellscarred, [[giant]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, [[illithid]]s, [[kobold]]s, [[lizardfolk]], [[:Category:Creatures found in seas and oceans|marine creatures]], [[wyvern]]s, It was possible to acquire more than one spellscar.

==Abilities==
Merely having a spellscar allowed afflicted individuals to sense the presence of the Spellplague nearby, but those spellscarred who wished to manifest more powerful, strange, and unique abilities had to train to do so.{{Cite dragon/385/Spellscars|23}} Many spellscarred individuals' lifespans were extended by one to two decades, and in rare cases, this longevity was inherited by their children.{{cite web |author=[[Ed Greenwood]] |url= https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1251181286917537792|title= Ed's Twitter |date=2020-04-17 |accessdate=2022-08-23}}

While the powers bestowed by spellscars were generally beneficial to the afflicted individual, the use of a spellscar often came with a cost. Having a spellscar generally rendered the bearer more susceptible to the energies of the Spellplague, Some spellscarred individuals suffered from disturbing dreams or bizarre visions which sometimes conveyed obscure secrets about the nature of magic. Activating a spellscar within the confines of a ''[[mythal]]'' caused that ''mythal'' to treat the spellscarred individual as an intruder within its field.

}}Those spellscarred individuals who devoted themselves to studying and training with their spellscar generally gained the ability to wield [[fire]]- and [[force]]-based powers or energies that could wither both the body and mind. Some could grant themselves additional powers by focusing their spellscar's energies, such as by funneling the blue flames to their eyes to ''[[see invisibility]]''

With sufficient training, so-called [[spellscarred savant]]s could overcome many of the inherent limitations of their spellscars, and even tap into [[spellfire]] to heal themselves and energize or vaporize others as they saw fit. While potent, spellscars did not generally confer the types of monstrous power seen in creatures that had been plaguechanged in more extreme fashion.

==History==
Spellscars first appeared in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, as a consequence of the Spellplague. The initial wave of the Spellplague often caused more extreme mutations than just spellscars, but in the following years, the scars became more common among those exposed to pockets of the Spellplague, and spellscarred individuals could be encountered all across [[Toril]] and [[Abeir]]. in [[Samarach]], near the [[Plaguewrought Land]] in the [[Vilhon Wilds]], and in the [[Underdark]], such as in [[Ch'Chitl]], the [[Deep Wastes]], 

[[File:Spellscarred_harbinger.jpg|thumb|left|''A spellscarred individual blocks a spell.'']]Spellscarred and plaguechanged individuals were often viewed as abominations, and as harbingers of fear and madness. Thus, they were often treated as outcasts, regardless of their own attitude toward their spellscar. while in the cities, the spellscarred were often quarantined in some fashion: [[Waterdeep]] preferred them to stay in [[Skullport]]{{Cite dungeon/200/Backdrop: Skullport|1}} or the slums of [[Mistshore]], [[Baldur's Gate]] unofficially quarantined them to [[Scarred Alley]] outside the city walls,{{Cite organized play/LFR/Silent Streets and Vanished Souls|12}} and [[Neverwinter]] held them first in a treatment center in the [[House of Knowledge (Neverwinter)|House of Knowledge]] before exiling them to [[Helm's Hold]] per the controversial "[[Protector's Law]]". Helm's Hold was the closest thing to a safe haven for spellscarred individuals, but even there they were not allowed in some taverns and faced a growing movement to expel them because of their "impurity". Elsewhere across [[Faerûn]], the spellscarred were seen as lesser members of society in [[Amn]]{{Cite dragon/407/D&D Love Stories|8}} and as deformed in the [[Moonsea]]. and in [[Turmish]], the [[Emerald Enclave]] ruthlessly killed them, viewing their spellscars as blights against the natural order. Meanwhile, as of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[wizard]]s of [[Deep Imaskar]] were experimenting on spellscarred individuals, and had also led them to develop a way to [[Purify spellscarred|remove spellscars entirely]].

Still, there were those who were proud of their spellscars,

With the return of [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], spellscars ceased to function as the Spellplague began to dissipate. Those who had visible scars or marks found that they now appeared as mundane but vivid [[tattoo]]s, which in rare cases might glow when they cast arcane [[spell]]s. In the years following the [[Second Sundering]], many spellscars faded&mdash;and, in rare cases, even disappeared entirely&mdash;while others gained new magical properties.
