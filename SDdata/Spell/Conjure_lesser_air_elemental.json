        "mainbody": "Conjure lesser air elemental was a spell used by wizards that brought a native from the Elemental Plane of Air to assist the caster.\nWhen cast, this spell summoned an air elemental to serve the caster until the spell expired. The caster had to concentrate to maintain control of the creature. The spell always carried a certain risk that the conjured elemental would break free. If this occurred, the air elemental became crazed and overcome with the need to bring violence upon the caster. The summoned air elemental remained in this berserk-like state until it was banished back to the Plane of Air, killed or the spell expired. Additionally, there was a small caster could regain control of the creature with a charm-based spell."
