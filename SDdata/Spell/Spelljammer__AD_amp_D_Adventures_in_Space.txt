'''''Spelljammer: AD&D Adventures in Space''''' is a supplement that introduces the Spelljammer campaign setting for AD&D 2{{nd}} edition. It contains a comprehensive description of several worlds, including [[Realmspace]] and the [[Forgotten Realms]].

{{quote|
''Multitudes of worlds wheel through [[Wildspace]]. The [[Crystal sphere|crystal shell]]s that encase them bob and drift in a turbulent, rainbow ocean which fills all the cosmos. Sturdy merchants, bold pirates, and daring explorers venture into the great, unknown vastness of the universe, seeking wealth and adventure.''

''The SPELLJAMMER Game puts you in command of a fantastic ship capable of spanning the tremendous distances between planets. Graceful [[elf|elven]] flitters, stately [[illithid]] galleys, deadly [[beholder]] tyrants, and the awesome ''Spelljammer'' itself carry trade, emissaries, and heroic action throughout all the worlds of the AD&D game.''

The set included two 96-page softbound books, four full-color 22x34 map/displays, 20 color card-stock reference displays, and four colorful card-stock cut-out counter sheets.

The "''Lorebook of the Void''" booklet describes space travel, commonly known ship types, spacefaring races, and monsters. The "''Concordance of Arcane Space''" details fantasy combat, more rules for spaceships, celestial mechanics, travel, and variations on rules for space. 

The set's cardstock sheets which provide both descriptions and deck plans for various ships, and counters for ship-to-ship combat. The set's large color maps depict two floating cities in space, a grid for space combat, and a map of the space between the planets of the ''Greyhawk'', ''Forgotten Realms'', and ''Dragonlance'' campaign settings, which allows player characters to travel between these settings. The set also includes guidelines for space campaigns, as well as campaign setting material.

The set includes systems for designing starships and for celestial navigation, and visual displays representing planetary systems for design and space travel. It provides mechanics, counters, ship displays, and a map display for tactical engagements between spelljamming craft; the mechanics are explicitly designed to supplement role-playing, not as a stand-alone board game. The set also contains color fold-out maps of the [[Spelljammer (spelljammer)|''Spelljammer'']], a colossal manta-ray-shaped starship a quarter-mile long with a half-mile wingspan, and the [[Rock of Bral]], an asteroid merchant and pirate port.

The tactical engagement system includes 8½" × 11" cardstock displays for 11 types of spelljammer ships, with a color illustration of the ship and a summary of tactical combat features on one side, and deck plans with map keys on the reverse.
