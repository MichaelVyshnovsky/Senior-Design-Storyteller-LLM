Wailing whips was a divine evocation spell that conjured a number of spectral whips for a short duration.
When cast, this spell created several floating whips, made of pure force energy, that lashed out in an area with a 30-foot diameter (9.1 meters). They whipped around the air making unsettling moans and howling sounds.
The duration of this spell did not end prematurely and its area-of-effect could not be moved however, its effects could be dispelled. They were non-harmful to the caster.
Wailing whips was one of the spells whose specifications could be found within the Lash of Loviatar.
This spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast.
