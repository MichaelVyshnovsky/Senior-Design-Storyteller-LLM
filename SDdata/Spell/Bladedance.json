        "mainbody": "Bladedance was a spell used by clerics of Eilistraee.\nThis spell was cast on any single-bladed melee weapon. When cast successfully, the touched weapon became animated and attacked a targeted creature. The enspelled weapon only moved and fought no other magical ability was given. The caster had to remain within  of the weapon otherwise the spell expired prematurely and the weapon fell to the ground. The casters skill level determined the size of the weapon that could be enchanted.\nThe weapon attacked the targeted creature as if wielded by the caster. It could also effectively defend the caster from attack. The weapon did not require the casters focus. While the spell was in effect, the caster was free to move about and cast another spell. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required both a material component, the holy symbol of Eilistraee."
