        "Effects": "The caster had to successfully touch the creature in order to cast this spell. ''Cure wounds'' healed a modest amount of damage when cast at its lowest level. If cast at higher levels, the potential healing increased with each level. This spell had no effect on [[undead]] creatures or [[construct]]s.\n\nBefore the Second Sundering, this spell could be used offensively against the undead. By laying their hand on a living creature, the caster channeled [[positive energy]] that healed a small amount of damage. In contrast, this inflicted damage on [[undead]], because they were instead powered by [[negative energy]]. Willful undead creatures had a chance to avoid some of the damage.\n\nThis was one of the few healing spells available as an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spell to [[bard]]s.\n\nThe oldest versions of this spell were reversible and called ''cause light wounds''. They were cast in an identical manner, but had the exact opposite effect&mdash;harming live creatures and healing the undead.",
        "Components": "Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell."
