        "mainbody": "Cure light wounds was a conjuration or evocation spell that healed minor injuries.\nThe caster had to successfully touch the creature in order to cast this spell. Cure wounds healed a modest amount of damage when cast at its lowest level. If cast at higher levels, the potential healing increased with each level. This spell had no effect on undead creatures or constructs.\nBefore the Second Sundering, this spell could be used offensively against the undead. By laying their hand on a living creature, the caster channeled positive energy that healed a small amount of damage. In contrast, this inflicted damage on undead, because they were instead powered by negative energy. Willful undead creatures had a chance to avoid some of the damage.\nThis was one of the few healing spells available as an arcane spell to bards.\nThe oldest versions of this spell were reversible and called cause light wounds. They were cast in an identical manner, but had the exact opposite effect&mdashharming live creatures and healing the undead.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell."
