'''''Probing arm''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Gond]], enabling them to create a mechanical arm.

==Effects==
This spell created a weightless mechanical arm made from [[steel]]. Both the upper and lower portions of the arm were {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} long. A swivelling wrist with four fingers and an opposable thumb composed the hand. The shoulder of the arm floated in the air near the caster's head.

The ''probing arm'' was incredibly strong and the caster could silently will both the upper and lower portions to elongate by up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. Though used mostly to grab distant objects, the arm could be used at a potent weapon by punching targets, grappling, or throwing objects. The caster could use the ''probing arm'' to open [[lock (item)|locks]] with a touch as per the ''[[knock]]'' spell, but doing so would cause the arm to vanish.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a pair of small sticks or rods, a pair of small wooden or glass balls, and two [[human]] hairs to cast.
