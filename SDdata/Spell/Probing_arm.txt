Probing arm was a divine alteration and evocation spell used by priests devoted to Gond, enabling them to create a mechanical arm.
This spell created a weightless mechanical arm made from steel. Both the upper and lower portions of the arm were  long. A swivelling wrist with four fingers and an opposable thumb composed the hand. The shoulder of the arm floated in the air near the casters head.
The probing arm was incredibly strong and the caster could silently will both the upper and lower portions to elongate by up to . Though used mostly to grab distant objects, the arm could be used at a potent weapon by punching targets, grappling, or throwing objects. The caster could use the probing arm to open locks with a touch as per the knock spell, but doing so would cause the arm to vanish.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a pair of small sticks or rods, a pair of small wooden or glass balls, and two human hairs to cast.
