Cubehopper was an alteration spell uniquely designed to aid wizards in traversing the plane of Acheron.
This spell allowed the caster to create temporary portals between any two of the gargantuan geometric blocks that floated all throughout Acheron. There was no distance limit, though the cubes had to exist within the same layer. The spell took one minute to cast and lasted until either a number of creatures equal to the casters prowess had passed through them or until the duration had expired. The starting duration was a period of one hour, but was cumulatively longer depending upon the casters prowess. Additionally, spellcasters could prematurely dispel their portals at will, or they could be dispelled by others with the spell gate seal.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, cubehopper required a material component in the form of a chip of iron from each of the cubes that were to be effected by the spell.
There were numerous rumors in circulation that a variant of cubehopper existed that allowed for creating portals from one layer of Acheron to another. These rumors always mentioned that a special spell key was necessary, though those who peddled such rumors never seemed to have an answer as to what this spell key was.
This spell was notoriously utilized in the layer of Avalas by the leaders of the goblinoid and orc spirit legions that waged endless war against each other, either as escape routes or gateways to planned massacres.
Sometime in the 14 century DR, a duergar sage living in Acheron by the name of Gheldoin gifted a spellbook containing cubehopper to a group of Ravenian adventurers after they impressed him by deciphering the script on an old scroll that detailed a story about Laduguer.
