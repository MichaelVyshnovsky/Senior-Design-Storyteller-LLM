'''''Levitation''''' was a type of [[giant]] rune that functioned similarly to the ''[[levitate]]'' [[spell]].

==Effect==
The ''levitation'' rune's effect generally had a duration of thirty minutes. A caster could study this rune extensively for an unlimited number of times and each instance of studying would contribute an extra thirty minutes to the effect's duration.

==Components==
Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to twenty minutes.

==History==
In the valley of [[Hartsvale]] in [[1366 DR]],{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}} [[Tavis Burdun]] and the [[runecaster]] [[Basil (verbeeg)|Basil]] went out into the woods in search of [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna Hartwick]] and discovered the aftermath of an ambush, including the bloody body of her bodyguard [[Morten]]. They soon determined that he was still be alive, albeit critically injured. Realizing they needed a way to transport Morten's large body back to [[Castle Hartwick]], Basil shaved the man's hairy chest and then used the fresh blood oozing from his bandaged neck to paint the ''levitation'' rune upon the former. Trailing behind them as they made their way there, Morten's floating body eventually reached the castle and was left in the hands of the [[priest|High Priest]] [[Simon (priest)|Simon]].
