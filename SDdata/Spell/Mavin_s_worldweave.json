The reader is free to interpret this as they see fit. The caster could target the center of the spell at any point within their field of view. One casting of the spell modified the climate one step on the following spectrum:\n<pre>Arctic &hArr; Subarctic &hArr; Temperate &hArr; Subtropic &hArr; Tropic</pre>\nAdditional steps required additional castings of the spell.",
        "Components": "''Mavin's worldweave'' required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[material component]]s, but the details have been lost to history.<ref group=\"note\">That is, the source neglected to mention them.",
        "History": "This spell was invented by the arcanist [[Mavin]] in the {{YearlinkName|-654}} ([[Netheril]] year 3205). It was used extensively on the northern border of Netheril to modify the subarctic climate to something more temperate."
