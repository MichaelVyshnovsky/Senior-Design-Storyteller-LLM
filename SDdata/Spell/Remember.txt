'''''Remember''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
A shugenja used this spell for two purposes. The first restored limited knowledge of a creatures past lives. It allowed information of the distant past to be brought forth. It could reveal information of the creatures current fortune, or information about forgotten locations. The second instantly restored memories lost to amnesia or possession.

The reverse of this spell was ''[[forget past]]''. When cast, the target creature forgot about recent events. The amount of knowledge lost was determined by the shugenja's skill level. The creature did not forget memorized spells. 

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell and its reverse required a [[material component]], a [[mirror]] made of metal.
