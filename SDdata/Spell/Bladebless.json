        "mainbody": "'''''Bladebless''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Tempus]], enabling them to heal a wound by blessing the weapon that caused it.",
        "Effects": "This spell only worked upon nonmagical weapons which were held by the caster during their intonations. Once the spell was cast the last wound caused by the blade within the last several hours would be fully healed. The ''bladebless'' would even heal severed limbs, poisonings, or decapitations. The caster did not need to know or even see the target of the healing, and the magic would even function across the [[planes]].",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the blade in question, the caster's [[holy symbol]], and a drop of [[holy water]] to cast."
