        "mainbody": "Bladebless was a powerful divine necromancy spell used by priests devoted to Tempus, enabling them to heal a wound by blessing the weapon that caused it.\nThis spell only worked upon nonmagical weapons which were held by the caster during their intonations. Once the spell was cast the last wound caused by the blade within the last several hours would be fully healed. The bladebless would even heal severed limbs, poisonings, or decapitations. The caster did not need to know or even see the target of the healing, and the magic would even function across the planes.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the blade in question, the casters holy symbol, and a drop of holy water to cast."
