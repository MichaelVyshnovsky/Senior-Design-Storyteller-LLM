'''''Venomfire''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that caused the venom within their body to become as corrosive as [[acid]], harming them from within.

==Effects==
While the effects of ''venomfire'' could last for hours, creatures affected by it could resist and negate the damage done to their bodies. Naturally, the spell had no effect on non-venomous creatures.

==Casting==
The spell required verbal and material components, the latter of which was a single drop of [[acid]].
