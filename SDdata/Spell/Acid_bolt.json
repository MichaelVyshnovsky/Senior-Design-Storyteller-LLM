        "mainbody": "'''''Acid bolt''''', not to be confused with ''[[acid arrow]]'', was an exceptionally old [[conjuration]] spell used in the [[Underdark]]. [[Wizards]] from the surface saw this spell as an improved version of ''Melf's acid arrow'', but it was actually completely different.",
        "Effects": "The spell, which had a large range of 600â€², was essentially a linear stream of [[acid|acidic]] liquid emanating from the wizard's hands. Once in contact with the target, a splash of acid would affect other targets within a 20' range, but caused less damage than that to the direct target.",
        "Components": "As well as a [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] component, an assortment of objects were needed as material components. These consisted of a specific pointed object (needle, [[dart]], thorn or icicle) to act as the bolt; saliva from the wizard; a sphere (either glass or crystal); and a [[vial]] of acid.",
        "History": "Being an incredibly old spell, the exact origin and creator were unknown. However, it was thought to be older than the Descent of the drow in {{Yearlink|-10000}}."
