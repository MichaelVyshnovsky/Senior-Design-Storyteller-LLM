An abjurer was a type of mage who specialized in the abjuration school of magic.
Some personality traits were more commonly found among some practitioners of abjuration. They were said to be exceptionally well-prepared for any adverse circumstance that may arise. Philosophically speaking they believed in prevention rather than reaction.
Abjurers were often hired by wealthy regents, nobles or other powerful individuals to grant various arcane boons. In some instances they were called upon to conceal or protect vast collections of wealth, while others requested them to cast out malevolent, supernatural forces. On some occasions, abjurers were hired to perform arcane exorcisms or close portals to other planes of existence.
These specialist wizards learned how to create arcane wards around their person whenever they utilized spells from the abjuration school. This magical barrier would absorb and nullify any harm inflicted upon them for a short duration. Over time, abjurers learned how to extend that ward onto other individuals.
Master abjurers developed a strong resilience against spells cast upon them, especially those that were physically harmful.
Some of the spells commonly utilized by abjurers included blade ward, mage armor, shield, counterspell, banishment, globe of invulnerability, and teleport.
Due to the nature of arcane specialization, abjurers were unable to cast spells from their opposing school of magic, that of illusion.
Abjurers preferred robes of dark green or brown to better fade into the background and always followed local customs of dress.
