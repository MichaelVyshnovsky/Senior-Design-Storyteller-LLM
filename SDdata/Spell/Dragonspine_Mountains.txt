The '''Dragonspine Mountains''', also referred to simply as the '''Dragonspines''', was a range of peaks in the western [[Moonsea]] of [[North Faerûn]], that divided the region into two separate halves.

==Description==
While not the largest peaks of the Realms, the Dragonspines were a series of rough crags that were extremely difficult to traverse. They were wracked with frigid temperatures that turned away all but the most experienced travelers.

Those that dared to brave the peaks could find themselves with great rewards however, as they were rich with natural resources, such as black [[granite]].

==Geography==
The mountains were bordered on the northern side by the vast steppes known as [[the Ride]], and to the west by the [[Border Forest]].{{Cite adventurers league/Pool of Radiance Resurgent|33}}

Two trails snaked through the mountains south from the [[Citadel of the Raven]], the [[Teshpost Trail]] down to [[Teshwave]], and the [[Zhentilar Trail]] all the way south to [[Zhentil Keep]].

===Geographical Features===
Notable peaks in the range included mounts [[Mount Launt|Launt]], [[Mount Ombaddor|Ombaddor]], [[Mount Horgrymborr|Horgrymborr]],{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}} [[Mount Throndor|Throndor]], [[Mount Tesh|Tesh]], and the caves of [[Skondarr]] beneath it,{{Cite dragon/291/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Skondarr|80}} as well as [[Eastwall]], the mountain that loomed over the entire Moonsea. 

Situated among the higher altitudes of the Dragonspines was the [[Glacier of the Silver Blades]]. Runoff water in the mountain formed two major rivers in the mountains; the western [[Stoneshoulder Creek]] flowed north into [[Lake Maltorus]], 

The Lords of [[Zhentil Keep]] had mines in the western half of the range,<ref name=LEoF-p134"> while [[Melvaunt]] and [[Hillsfar]] had mines in the eastern half.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/The Dragons' Claw Portals: The Dragonspine Mountains Portal}}

==Trade==
The eastern slopes of the Dragonspines held a passage to the [[Underdark]], that facilitated slave trade between the Zhentarim and the [[drow]].

==History==
The [[Treaty of the Ride]] was signed at a peace accord held within the foothills of the Dragonspines in the {{YearlinkName|906}}.

In the {{yearlinkName|1355}}, the group of [[Zhentarim]]-hating freedom fighters known as the [[Knights of the North]] formed in the foothills of the mountains. For over a decade they led raids against Zhent forces until they grew to greater prominence.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Citadel of the Raven]], the networked fortressed of the Zhentarim and personal domain of the [[archmage]] [[Manshoon]], that remained a smattering of ruins as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
* [[Redhorn]], a 15{{th}} century hold of the returned [[Cult of the Dragon]].
* [[Temple of the Scale]], the home of the [[dragon]]-worshiping [[druid]]s known as the [[Circle of the Scale]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|5}}

==Inhabitants==
As of the 14{{th}} century, [[Red dragon|red]], [[white dragon|white]], and at least one pair of [[copper dragon]]s were known to lair in the higher peaks, along with other aerial creatures such as [[dire hawk]]s, and [[hippogriff]]s.<ref name=EE.EM-p7">

[[Goblin]]s, [[orc]]s, and [[giant]]s filled the lower areas and valleys,

===Notable Inhabitants===
* [[Malaritheos]] & [[Zathrantramix]], mating red dragons that lived in the dormant volcano.
