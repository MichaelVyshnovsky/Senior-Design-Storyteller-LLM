        "Effects": "The summoned invisible stalker would obey the caster through any means possible, until the task was accomplished. As they were excellent trackers, they could find out where any targets had gone. As they were not loyal to their conjurer masters, they would often dally in their tasks, especially if they took place over a long distance or period of time.\n\nThey could take orders via [[Common]] only, unless their masters spoke [[Auran]], in which the stalkers could respond.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material component was a crescent-shaped horn and some burning [[incense]].",
        "History": "The spell was invented by [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Carbury]] in {{Yearlink|-857}}, and was first known as ''Carbury's stalker''.\n\nIn the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''invisible stalker'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}"
