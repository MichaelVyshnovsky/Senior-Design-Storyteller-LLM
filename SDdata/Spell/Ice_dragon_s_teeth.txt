Ice dragons teeth was a spell available to sorcerers after the Spellplague, circa 1479 DR.
When ice dragons teeth was cast, tooth-like daggers of ice burst over an area  in diameter that was no more than  from the sorcerer. Any beings struck by them were not only injured by cold, but found their movements slowed for several seconds.
