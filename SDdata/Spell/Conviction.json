        "mainbody": "'''''Conviction''''' was a [[divine]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] from the first circle of magic that busted a creature's physical, mental, and spiritual power. The spell could be used by [[cleric]]s.",
        "Effects": "With a touch, the caster [[cleric]] empowered a target creature. Its morale boost made it harder to fall to panic, fear, and similar feelings in battle, and general empowerment made it harder to fall under the effects of spells, abilities, and physical dangers. The spell's power increased with the cleric's magical prowess and divine favor.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and the [[material component]] of a small piece of [[parchment]] inscribed with the cleric's deity's holy scripture."
