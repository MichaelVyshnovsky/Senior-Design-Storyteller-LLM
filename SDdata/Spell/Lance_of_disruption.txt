'''''Lance of disruption''''' was an [[arcane]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] that produced a damaging lance and could blast wood and stonework apart.

==Effects==
The disruptive lance, which was {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} long and {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} wide, damaged all creatures caught within. The damage scaled with the power of the caster. Some creatures were able to resist, and if so, were only subject to half the damage. However, amorphous beings, like [[ooze]]s, were resistant to the lance's power.

Inanimate objects, such as walls, ornaments, and furniture, could be blasted apart by the power of the lance. More sturdy objects would be severely damaged.

==Components==
This uncommon spell only required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
