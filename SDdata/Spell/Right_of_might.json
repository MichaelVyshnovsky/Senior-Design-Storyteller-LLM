        "mainbody": "Right of might was a divine alteration and enchantment spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Gilgeam called Martinets.\nThis spell empowered the caster by combining three other spellsâ€“enlarge, command, and strength. Casters influenced by this spell were larger, stronger, and their voice was capable of subduing others. The size of the casters equipment also increased proportionately.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the Martinets holy symbol to cast."
