        "mainbody": "Command water spirits was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell did not actually allow the caster to command water spirits, instead it allowed them to manipulate the currents of large bodies of water to move objects on or under the surface.\nThis spell was particularly useful for controlling ships in becalmed water or during a severe storm.\nThe caster could also use this spell to create a powerful undertow to drown his enemies.\nThis spell required a clear glass to cast."
