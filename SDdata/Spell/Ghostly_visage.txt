Ghostly visage was a protective illusion spell cast by bards, sorcerers, and wizards. The spell created a nimbus of ghostly light around the caster.
The ghostly nimbus created by this spell protected the caster in various ways. It canceled the effects of any spell that was less powerful than ghostly visage, as well as making the caster harder to hit. Even the hits that did land were less effective unless the enemy used a magical weapon.
The spell required verbal and somatic components.
