        "mainbody": "Mistake was a spell used by clerics of Baravar Cloakshadow.\nAfter casting, this spell allowed the caster to somewhat hide their identity to another sentient being. This was achieved by the spell giving a false impression of the caster, which led the targeted creature to mistook the caster for someone else. The mistaken identity was usually one that provoked the least response in the targeted creature.\nThis spell did not prevent the caster from being identified or restrained, it merely increased the probability they did not. The spell did not function if the targeted creature has met the caster before or witnessed the spell being cast. In addition, the spell often failed against incredibly intelligent creatures.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Baravar Cloakshadow and a single thin piece of transparent material."
