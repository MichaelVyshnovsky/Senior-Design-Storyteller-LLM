        "mainbody": "Focal stone was a divine alteration/transmutation spell from the elemental earth sphere that the structure of a clear or translucent gem stone, enabling it to receive the dweomer of a spell.\nThe stone in question could not be larger than the casters balled fist. Gemstones of higher quality stood a better chance of success. The spell dweomer was usually added via dweomerflow. When cast, the gemstone would glow internally. All focal stones, regardless of the spell they held, could receive the life force from a magic jar, could neutralize poison if placed into the liquid, and commanded to do so. When submerged in a poisonous or toxic liquid, such stones turned a vibrant purple color. However, doing so would destroy the focal stone. Shattering a focal stone would release the full effects of the store spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a pinch of opal dust.\nThe ancient gold dragon Valamaradace used this spell, along with abeyance and multiple castings of greater levitate to keep her private sanctuary, the earthmote known as the Floating Mountain, aloft in the skies over the North.\nThis was an extremely rare spell on Toril."
