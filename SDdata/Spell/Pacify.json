        "Effects": "This spell pacified creatures within the spell's area of effect. Once cast, harmful spells and weapons were unable to be used, and creatures could not physically impede other creatures. If a pacified creature was attacked by another creature who was not affected by the spell, the spell on the targeted creature was lifted.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components. During casting, the shugenja uttered several sutras."
