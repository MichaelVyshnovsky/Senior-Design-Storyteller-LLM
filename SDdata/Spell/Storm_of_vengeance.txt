'''''Storm of vengeance''''' was a mighty [[divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that called a mighty thunderstorm, causing [[acid]] and hail to rain down on foes, as well producing booming thunder.

==Effect==
A massive black storm cloud was conjured, some {{SI|720|ft}} wide up to a long range from the caster. Accompanying this were lightning and thunderclaps. Those caught under the cloud who could not withstand its effects were deafened for up forty minutes.

The caster had to continue concentrating on the spell, otherwise the black storm would dissipate after several seconds. If the caster was able to keep concentrating on the spell, additional effects occurred every six seconds. First, corrosive [[acid]] rain struck the area, which foes were unable to escape from. Second, six bolts of lightning were sent down from the cloud, and the caster could choose exactly where they struck, but not at the same target. The bolts dealt huge damage, but creatures with quick reflexes could avoid a portion of it. Third, hailstones bombarded the area, which were impossible to dodge.

After this initial period, the storm would become extremely intense, with severe rain and extraordinarily strong wind gusts. Both weather effects greatly reduced visibility to only {{SI|5|ft}}, with anything beyond that obscured, and even creatures with [[darkvision]] were unable to see in the chaotic conditions. In the turmoil, all creatures were forced to move much slower, and ranged attacks literally became impossible. Only the most skilled [[mage]]s were able to pull off spells in this region, and it required great concentration.

The spell expired after a minute.

==Components==
Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were required.

==Crafting==
This spell was one of several that could be used in the creation of ''[[acidic burst]]'' weapons.
