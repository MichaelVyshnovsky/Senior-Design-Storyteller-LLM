Mythal recovery is an abjuration spell used by some swordmages to rid themselves of negative effects placed upon them by enemies. When a swordmage casts mythal recovery he or she turns their magical wardings inward, giving them a chance to cast off a hindering effect left upon them by some enemy or other obstacle. The spell is not terribly complex and can be used again after a short rest of a few minutes or more.
