Wondercraft was an extremely powerful spell that copied magic items.
On casting the spell, a mage automatically created, without the need for an object to enchant or for many material components, a copy of an item they had created or whose properties they had handled within a year and a half, maybe more for more powerful wizards.
Each property had a chance not to manifest, inversely proportional to the mages ability to manage dangerous magic even those that did had a chance of over one in four to be twisted into something else, something random, and for objects with more than two properties, the chance quickly escalated into near-certainty.
The casters health was damaged by the spell. Though it was temporary, unlike that of a permanency, it increased exponentially if more than one such spell was used within 24 hours- no one would survive casting it four times.
The items lasted for at least 18 years there was no way whatsoever to make them last longer.
Besides verbal and somatic components, the spell required three drops of water, three drops of dew or a flask of captured mist, three stones of any size, and three pinches of ash from a fire. All of those had to have been touched by magic at some point.
Azuth made this spell available through Elminster sometime prior to .
