        "Effects": "This spell created a gargantuan [[humanoid]] torso that rose from the ground in front of the caster. The ''colossus'' could be up to {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} tall with a reach of {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}}. It resembled a bald [[human]] made from the same material as the earth from which it rose. A mouth was its only facial feature. It could not move from where it was summoned, but could pivot in place. The caster could use mental commands to make the ''colossus'' attack targets with smashing attacks, but it was unable to grasp or squeeze anything. The caster was the only thing the ''colossus'' could pick up with its hands.\n\nThe caster could urge the ''colossus'' to roar up to six different words as often as required. These words were not triggers for other magic, nor could they be used to cast a spell. The ''colossus'' absorbed any magic that was directed at the caster, transferring the effects of such spells to the ''colossus'' while keeping the caster safe.\n\nThe spell's duration was shortened by one minute for each strike of the ''colossus''' fists against a target or when the ''colossus'' absorbed an enemy spell. The ''colossus'' faded away when the spell ended or upon its destruction.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a ball of [[clay]] large enough to fill the caster's hand and bit of string, [[wire]] or natural fiber to cast."
