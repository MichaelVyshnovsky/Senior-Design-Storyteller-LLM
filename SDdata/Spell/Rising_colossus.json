        "mainbody": "Rising colossus was a wizard spell from the school of evocation.\nThis spell created a gargantuan humanoid torso that rose from the ground in front of the caster. The colossus could be up to  tall with a reach of . It resembled a bald human made from the same material as the earth from which it rose. A mouth was its only facial feature. It could not move from where it was summoned, but could pivot in place. The caster could use mental commands to make the colossus attack targets with smashing attacks, but it was unable to grasp or squeeze anything. The caster was the only thing the colossus could pick up with its hands.\nThe caster could urge the colossus to roar up to six different words as often as required. These words were not triggers for other magic, nor could they be used to cast a spell. The colossus absorbed any magic that was directed at the caster, transferring the effects of such spells to the colossus while keeping the caster safe.\nThe spells duration was shortened by one minute for each strike of the colossus fists against a target or when the colossus absorbed an enemy spell. The colossus faded away when the spell ended or upon its destruction.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a ball of clay large enough to fill the casters hand and bit of string, wire or natural fiber to cast."
