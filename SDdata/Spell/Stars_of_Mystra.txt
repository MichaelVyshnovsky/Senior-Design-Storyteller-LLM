'''''Stars of Mystra''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]].

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created a number of sparkling stars that orbited the head of the caster, similar to [[ioun stone]]s. The number of stars was determined by the caster's skill level, to a maximum of five stars at once. The stars were used as a ranged weapon, with the caster launching a star, one at a time, at a target. When used against an evil-aligned caster, they lost any prepared spells. If used against an evil-aligned creature with innate magical abilities, the stars randomly negated one of its abilities. The spell had no effect on mundane creatures or individuals who were not spellcasters.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
