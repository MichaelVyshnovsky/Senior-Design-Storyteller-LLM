        "mainbody": "Contact archetype was a spell that could only be cast by dragons.\nWhen cast, this spell allowed a dragon to attempt contact with one of the two main dragon deities and seek answers to a question. Metallic dragons used this spell to contact Bahamut, and chromatic dragons used this spell to contact Tiamat. Both Bahamut and Tiamat avoided contact in this fashion so answers given were short and to the point. The amount of question a dragon may ask was determined by their skill level. If either deity did not know the answer to a specific question, they would just give an incorrect answer. Using this spell was risky, as the dragon risked becoming insane due to contact with such powerful dragons.\nThis spell required only a verbal component."
