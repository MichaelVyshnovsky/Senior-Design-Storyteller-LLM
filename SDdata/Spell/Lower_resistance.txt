'''''Lower resistance''''' was an uncommon [[abjuration]]/[[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to reduce the [[magic]]al resistances of a single target.

==Effects==
The spell attempted to strip a single creature of some of its magic resistance. The subject's magic resistance still worked against the spell itself, but only at half its regular potency. If the target creature had no magic resistance, it did not make it more susceptible to magic, essentially voiding the spell. The more experienced the caster was, the more magic resistance was stripped. More powerful casters could make the spell's effects last for far longer.

==Components==
[[Verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material]] components were needed to cast the spell. The single material component was a broken [[iron]] rod.

==History==
In [[840 DR]], [[Sammaster]] made significant discoveries in the field of [[metamagic]], leading to a several new spells, including ''lower resistance''.
