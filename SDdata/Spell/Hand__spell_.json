        "mainbody": "'''''Hand''''' was a [[spell]] that could only be cast by [[dragon]]s. It allowed a dragon who was unable to polymorph to perform tasks requiring precise movements or manipulations.",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell created a human-sized hand that glowed softly. The hand was able to lift up to {{SI|60|lb|k}} in weight. The hand had to remain within sight of the dragon, if the line of sight was blocked by an object, the spell expired. The hand was unable to throw an object or use a weapon.",
        "Casting": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components."
