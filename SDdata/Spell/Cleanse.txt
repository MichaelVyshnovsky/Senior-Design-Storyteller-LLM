Cleanse was a southern magic divine spell.
When cast, the spell cleaned the caster, including the clothing worn during casting. The spell removed dirt, grease, grime and stains. If an article of clothing was faded, the spell restored the color to its original shade. The spell also had a measure of healing abilities. The spell disinfected any wounds, and also healed the caster from both minor illnesses or the beginning stages of more serious diseases. Lycanthropy, mummy rot, and diseases caused by rat bites were unaffected by cleanse.
In addition to somatic and verbal components, this spell required a material component, a piece of soap
