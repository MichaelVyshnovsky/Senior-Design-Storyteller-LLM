Enchant phylactery was a divine enchantment spell from the guardian and protection spheres that placed another spell upon a phylactery that was triggered when it was opened.
If attuned to a specific individual, as was the case with a lich, the individual would not be injured by any harmful spells placed upon the phylactery if they opened it. The desired spell to be placed upon the phylactery needed to be cast by the caster of enchant phylactery immediately upon casting the spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a strand of spider web and one of the casters eyelashes and fingernail clippings to cast.
The Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the Mystran faith, could cast the enchant phylactery spell.
