Snillocs snowball swarm, also just snowball swarm, was a spell that generated an explosion of snowballs that covered a  radius area. An older version of this spell covered a  radius but did less damage.
When the caster finished the spell, those within the area felt an unnatural chill. This cold dissipated suddenly as a barrage of snowballs burst forth. 
The caster could choose the center of the explosion and was subject to being struck if within the area of effect.
Verbal, somatic, and material components were required to cast this spell, including a piece of ice or a small chip of white rock. The material component of the earlier version of the spell was either ice or a single pearl.
This spell was created by the mage Snilloc. He placed this spell in the tome The Collected Wisdom of Snilloc. Eventually the tome was stolen and this spell was copied and appeared throughout the Realms. This spell was also in the pamphlet Volos Guide to All Things Magical published at the start of 1369 DR. This spell quickly passed into the ranks of the Zhentarim and most of their mages had access to this spell. The Red Wizards of Thay quite often placed this spell on scrolls.
