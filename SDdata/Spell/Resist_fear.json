Those within a 30 foot (9.1 meter) radius<ref group=\"note\">The radius was half this in ''[[Icewind Dale]]''. of the target would become instilled with great courage and morale. Even [[magic]]al fear could not scare off those under the effect of ''resist fear''.\n\nThe spell lasted for an hour, and the recipients' morale gradually lowered to standard levels as the spell reached the end of its duration."
