'''''Shadow conjuration''''', also known as '''''shadow monsters''''',<ref> was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that created semi-real duplicates of lesser [[conjuration]] spells.

==Effect==
The spell drew energy from the [[Plane of Shadow]] in order to create a semi-real duplicate of any conjuration spell of lesser power from the subschools of summoning or creation.

If the victim recognized the illusion, the shadow energy was a lot less effective than the duplicated spell. It was always less effective on objects as objects couldn't believe in the first place.

The spell also had a [[Greater shadow conjuration|greater version]] that allowed the duplication of stronger spells and was more powerful, even when seen through as an illusion. An even stronger version of the spell was the ''[[shades]]'' spell.

==Components==
''Shadow conjuration'' used verbal and somatic components only.

On the [[Malatran Plateau]], both [[arcane]] and [[divine]] magics were harnessed using ''[[spell fetish]]es''. ''Shadow conjuration arcane spell fetish '' was a shard of a smoky crystal that protected strange shifting shadows when light shone through.{{Cite organized play/LJ/An Army of One Thousand/Certificates}}

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Telamont Tanthul|Shadow]] in {{Yearlink|-588}} and was originally called ''Shadow's monster''.
