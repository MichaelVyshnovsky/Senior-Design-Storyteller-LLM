        "mainbody": "Apparition was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur that caused a subjects face to become terrifying. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThe spell transformed the targets face into a horrifying mask. The caster was not able to duplicate the appearance of any existing creature, and thus created the horrible mask using portions of different creatures. When viewed by others, the mask had a startling effect. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a small painters palette with paints of various colors."
