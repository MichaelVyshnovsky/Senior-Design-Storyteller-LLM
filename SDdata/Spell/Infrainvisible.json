        "mainbody": "'''''Infrainvisible''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Shevarash]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell hides the infrared signature of a targeted creature. This allowed the targeted creature to become invisible to [[infravision]]. The spell did not render the targeted creature truly invisible, so they could still be detected by mundane, such as hearing or small, or magical means. Anything carried by the targeted creature also became invisible to infravision, but became visible once released. While the spell was in effect, any item picked up became invisible to infravision. The spell was unable to mask the heat signature of very hot items or fire itself.\n\nThe spell lasted up to a full day if not dispelled. The effects of the spell were broken if the targeted creature attacks another.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Shevarash and a single drop of ichor from a beetle."
