Icy claw was a powerful spell. 
When cast, the spell created a large dragon claw, made from ice, in mid-air. The hand had four sharp talons and was about  in length. It flew through the air at a target with great speed. A targeted creature could not use effects or spells, such as darkness or invisibility, to conceal itself from the claw. Icy claw was vulnerable to dispel magic and disintegrate. Additionally, the claw could not break through a wall of force nor could it enter an antimagic field. It was also affected by both the prismatic sphere and prismatic wall spells. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a focus, a claw from a white dragon.
