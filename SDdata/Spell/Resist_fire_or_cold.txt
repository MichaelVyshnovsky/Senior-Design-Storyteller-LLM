'''''Resist fire/resist cold''''' was an [[alteration]] spell that granted immunity from normal heat and cold to the subject and improved defenses against intense or magical heat and cold. This spell was the combination of the older '''''resist cold''''' and '''''resist fire''''' spells, allowing the caster to choose the form of protection at the time of casting.

==Effects==
The caster was required to touch the recipient in order to bestow this protection. This spell made the subject immune to normal cold temperatures (experiencing no discomfort standing naked on a glacier, for example), or normal fire (experiencing no discomfort holding a finger in a candle flame, for example), as chosen by the caster. If exposed to more intense heat or cold, such as being engulfed in burning oil, hit by a flaming or frostbrand sword, caught in an ice storm, splashed by lava, being on the receiving end of a ''[[fireball]]'' or ''[[cone of cold]]'', or being blasted by the [[dragon breath]] of a [[white dragon|white]] or [[red dragon]], then the subject took only half the usual amount of damage and this spell gave the subject a greatly increased chance to resist such attacks, further reducing the damage to one quarter the normal amount.

The trade-off for combining both types of protection in one spell was that the older separate spells lasted ten times longer than the newer combined spell.

==Components==
All versions of this spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components. ''Resist fire'' and ''resist fire/resist cold'' also needed a drop of [[mercury]] as a [[material]] component. ''Resist cold'' needed a pinch of sulfur.
