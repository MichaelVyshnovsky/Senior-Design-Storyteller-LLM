        "mainbody": "Share husk was, prior to the Spellplague, a divination spell used by druids. Following the Spellplague, it became an exploration ritual.\nShare husk granted the caster the ability to utilize an animals senses of sight, smell, and hearing. For this spell to work the caster and subject animal needed to be on the same plane of existence.\nFollowing the Spellplague, the general effects of share husk remained largely the same, though with some notable differences. The ritual could only be cast on natural creatures that were not hostile and they had to be present for the entirety of the rituals casting. Once the ritual was complete the casters spirit left their body and possessed the animals, leaving their own body in a helpless deep sleep-like state. Once in the target creatures body the caster could perceive everything through their senses and influence them with simple commands, such as \"go there\" or \"wait\".\nIf either the casters body or the possessed animal was attacked, the ritual would end and the casters spirit would return to their body. In the latter case, this was due to threats to the animal causing their instincts to take over.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component in the form of an edible treat appropriate for the animal to cast. Following the Spellplague, this material component generally cost around 150 gold pieces."
