        "mainbody": "'''''Mass bear's endurance''''' was identical to ''[[bear's endurance]]'' except that it could be cast on up to six creatures (more, for higher-level casters). The group of targets all had to be within 30 ft (9.1 m) of each other and relatively close to the caster. The maximum range of this spell started at 40 ft (12 m). Again, more experienced casters could reach farther."
