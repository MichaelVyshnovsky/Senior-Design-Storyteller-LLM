Stone shape was a transmutation spell or alteration spell that reshaped stone objects.
Fine detail was not possible, but natural or worked stone could be manipulated by means of this spell to form most any shape the caster desired&mdashan arch, a statue, a door, or a wall with a hole in it, for example. If small moving parts were required, there was a chance the mechanism just wouldnt function.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spellcaster needed a material component in the form of a lump of clay. This clay had to be crudely molded into the desired shape and then brought into contact with the stone to be reshaped. Some druids also required mistletoe.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Proctiv in  and was originally called Proctivs shape stone.
Urdunnir dwarves were blessed by Dumathoin with the ability to cast stone shape whenever they wished.
