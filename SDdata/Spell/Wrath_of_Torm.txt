Wrath of Torm was a divine spell that granted the caster tremendous power for a short duration.
When the spell was cast, the cleric became illuminated with a white light and grew to 12 feet (3.7 meters) in height. For the spells duration they appeared to be exceptionally charismatic, they became more skillful in combat, and their attacks inflicted extra harm unto the undead.
The specifications of this spell were inscribed upon one of the metal plates found on the reverse side of the Veloghon of Vigilance.
This spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast.
