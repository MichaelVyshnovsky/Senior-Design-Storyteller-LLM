        "mainbody": "'''''Kami absorption''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell allowed a shugenja to infuse a willing recipient with the [[kami]] of another being or object. This spell only functioned if the targeted being or object had it. Absorbing kami from a [[deity]] or avatar was impossible. The spell failed if the recipient did not agree to the spell. For the duration of the spell, the recipient absorbed the essential nature of the being or object. The being or object from which the kami was absorbed was not harmed by this spell.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components."
