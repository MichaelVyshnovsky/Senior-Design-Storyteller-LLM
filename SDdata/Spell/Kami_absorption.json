        "mainbody": "Kami absorption was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, this spell allowed a shugenja to infuse a willing recipient with the kami of another being or object. This spell only functioned if the targeted being or object had it. Absorbing kami from a deity or avatar was impossible. The spell failed if the recipient did not agree to the spell. For the duration of the spell, the recipient absorbed the essential nature of the being or object. The being or object from which the kami was absorbed was not harmed by this spell.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
