        "mainbody": "Faith arrow was a spell used by elven clerics, primarily the clergy of Corellon Larethian, Rillifane Rallathil, Solonor Thelandira.\nThis spell allowed the caster to enchant several mundane arrows, imbuing them with divine power. The amount of arrows that could be enchanted was determined by the casters skill level, up to six arrows. The spell had no effect on magical arrows. As long as the target was within range and sight, the enchanted arrows never missed. The arrows could not penetrate material that stopped a mundane arrow, but could follow a target. When the arrow struck its target, it delivered devastating damage. If the arrows passed through a dead-magic zone or an anti-magic shell, it lost its enchantment. Once enchanted, an arrows remained enchanted until it was used, afterwards it turned to dust.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of the caster and the arrows. The arrows had to have been crafted by an expert fletcher."
