Mind ream is a spell unique to the War Wizards of Cormyr that allows the mage to extract information from a persons mind.  The spell often leaves the victims mind in ruins. 
With the changes to the magical weave after the Spellplague, the spell often destroys the mind of the caster as well as the victim.  Terminally ill War Wizards sometimes volunteer to cast the mind ream spell as a last service to Cormyr.
