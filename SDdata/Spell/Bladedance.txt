'''''Bladedance''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Eilistraee]].

==Effects==
This spell was cast on any single-bladed melee weapon. When cast successfully, the touched weapon became animated and attacked a targeted creature. The enspelled weapon only moved and fought; no other magical ability was given. The caster had to remain within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of the weapon otherwise the spell expired prematurely and the weapon fell to the ground. The caster's skill level determined the size of the weapon that could be enchanted.

The weapon attacked the targeted creature as if wielded by the caster. It could also effectively defend the caster from attack. The weapon did not require the caster's focus. While the spell was in effect, the caster was free to move about and cast another spell. 

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required both a [[material component]], the holy symbol of Eilistraee.
