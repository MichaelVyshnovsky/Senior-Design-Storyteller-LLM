'''''Swift quiver''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[ranger]]s.

==Effects==
This spell transmuted the caster's [[quiver]], allowing it to produce an infinite amount of mundane ammunition that could be drawn and loosed exceptionally quickly from a ranged weapon. The spell expired if the quiver was removed from the caster, and caused all additional arrows created from it to vanish.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a quiver with at least one piece of ammunition.
