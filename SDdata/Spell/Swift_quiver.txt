Swift quiver was a spell used by rangers.
This spell transmuted the casters quiver, allowing it to produce an infinite amount of mundane ammunition that could be drawn and loosed exceptionally quickly from a ranged weapon. The spell expired if the quiver was removed from the caster, and caused all additional arrows created from it to vanish.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a quiver with at least one piece of ammunition.
