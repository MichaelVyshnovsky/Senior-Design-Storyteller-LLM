        "mainbody": "Otilukes telekinetic sphere () was an evocation spell that produced an effect similar to Otilukes resilient sphere. It was presumably developed by Otiluke.\nTo Zakharan mages, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as telekinetic sphere, and counted among the spells of the universal province.\nMuch like Otilukes resilient sphere, this spell created a shimmering sphere of force, with their diameter being a differing number of feet according to the power of the caster.\nHowever, unlike that spell the creatures or objects trapped inside such spheres weighed only  their normal weight. Subjects weighing up to  could be telekinetically lifted within these spheres and even if their actual weight exceeded this limit, their perceived weight would still only be . Because of that reduced weight, anything within these spheres experienced relatively little harm from falling or rapid motion.\nThe range of control for this spell extended out to a maximum distance of  per level after a subject was successfully trapped within a sphere.\nThis spells effect can be dismissed with a simple command word.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components in the form of a hemispherical piece of diamond, a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic, and a pair of small bar magnets."
