It was presumably developed by [[Otiluke]].\n\nTo [[Zakhara]]n [[mage]]s, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''telekinetic sphere''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].",
        "Effects": "Much like ''Otiluke's resilient sphere'', this spell created a shimmering sphere of [[force]], with their diameter being a differing number of feet according to the power of the caster.\n\nHowever, unlike that spell the creatures or objects trapped inside such spheres weighed only {{frac|1|16}}{{th}} their normal weight. Subjects weighing up to {{SI|5000|lbs.|k}} could be telekinetically lifted within these spheres and even if their actual weight exceeded this limit, their perceived weight would still only be {{frac|1|16}}{{th}}. Because of that reduced weight, anything within these spheres experienced relatively little harm from falling or rapid motion.\n\nThe range of control for this spell extended out to a maximum distance of {{SI|10|yards|long=yes}} per level after a subject was successfully trapped within a sphere.\n\nThis spell's effect can be dismissed with a simple [[command word]].",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s in the form of a hemispherical piece of [[diamond]], a matching hemispherical piece of [[gum arabic]], and a pair of small bar magnets."
