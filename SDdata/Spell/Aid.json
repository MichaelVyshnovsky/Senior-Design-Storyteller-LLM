        "mainbody": "'''''Aid''''' was a spell that belonged to many schools because it gave the recipient a temporary boost in health and improved both morale in the face of fear and combat skill.",
        "Effects": "The abjuration version of this spell could be cast on a target up to 30 ft (9.1 m) away. In all other versions, the caster had to touch the recipient in order to cast this spell. The effect of this spell was a health boost that lasted for the duration of the spell or until the health was lost due to subsequent injury, poison, energy drain, etc., whichever came first. In addition, earlier versions of this spell included the effect of ''[[bless]]''.",
        "Components": "The enchantment version of this spell required verbal and somatic components, including touching the subject, and the priest's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]]. The necromantic version of this spell also required a small bandage in the form of a white strip of cloth with an adhesive (such as tree sap) on each end. The abjuration version of this spell also used a small strip of white cloth, but did not require an adhesive."
