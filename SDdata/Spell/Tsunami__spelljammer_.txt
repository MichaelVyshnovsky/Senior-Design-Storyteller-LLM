The tsunami were enormous serpentine-shaped spelljammers, designed and operated by humans from Wa. They were the largest ships constructed in Realmspace.
Tsunami were huge centipede-looking flying ships. They moved through air and space in a winding and graceful motion and were also capable of moving on solid ground on leg-looking appendages in order to reach protective bunkers.
The decks were constantly illuminated by continual light spells, which served as a scare tactic for enemies and also illuminated the gardens designed to increase the ships autonomy.
Each ship carried in its cargo hold a compliment of 36 locusts, which were commonly referred to as a "plague".
The ship had enough room and air to support a crew of 200 individuals for up to ten months, but could support almost twice as many if needed. The large crew, required to operate the ships helm, its numerous weapons, and its compliment of locusts, was held under a strict hierarchy.
Was fleet of tsunami was developed and built over the course of a decade in the mid–14 century DR. The ships were developed as a reaction to Shou Lung and elven presence in space, as the Wa government feared an invasion by either of those forces. During the early period of Wa spelljammer development, many elven raiders stole and stripped Wa ships in order to use their helms to power their flitters. To prevent further stealing of their helms, Wa developed the ki-helm, which could not be used by elves at the time. The large tsunami were developed to match the elven armadas and men-o-war, basically emulating the armadas capability of carrying flitters.
In the mid–14 century DR, six tsunami existed, of which only two were deployed at any given time.
