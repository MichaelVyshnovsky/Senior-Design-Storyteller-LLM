Blastback swipe was a spell used by some swordmages, particularly those of the assault style.
When cast, even when charging, blastback swipe caused the swordmages weapon to strike a foe with the force and sound of a thunderclap. The sonic energy not only caused the creature extra injury, but also pushed them back 10 feet (3 meters).
Assault swordmages could also use it for their aegis of assault spell.
