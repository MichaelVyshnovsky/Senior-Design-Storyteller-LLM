'''''Blastback swipe''''' was a [[spell]] used by some [[swordmage]]s, particularly those of the [[Swordmage#Assault Swordmage|assault]] style.

==Effects==
When cast, even when charging, ''blastback swipe'' caused the swordmage's weapon to strike a foe with the force and sound of a thunderclap. The sonic energy not only caused the creature extra injury, but also pushed them back 10 feet (3 meters).

Assault swordmages could also use it for their ''[[aegis of assault]]'' spell.
