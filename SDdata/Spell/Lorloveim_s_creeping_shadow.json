        "mainbody": "Lorloveims creeping shadow was an illusion spell used by wizards. This spell was developed by Lorloveim.\nThis spell caused the casters shadow to elongate out from their body. The distance the shadow was capable of expanding depended on the skill of the caster. The caster could move their shadow where they wished and it behaved like a normal shadow. The shadow was utterly silent and practically invisible unless in the brightest setting.\nThe caster was able to speak, see, and hear through their shadow. The shadow could not physically interact with anything. It could only be harmed by spells or enchanted weapons.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small statuette of the caster to cast. The sculpture needed to be carved from obsidian and worth at least 1,000 gold pieces. A light source at least as bright as a candle needed to be present when the spell was cast."
