        "mainbody": "'''''Humansize''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to priests of [[Arvoreen]], the Vigilant Guardian. It temporarily increased the size of one [[halfling]] to that of a [[human]], along with everything they were wearing or carrying.",
        "Effects": "This spell only worked on halflings, and could be cast on oneself or another halfling that could be touched. The target and all its clothing and carried items grew proportionately until the target was the size of a human, so a [[short sword]] became a [[long sword]], for example. The spell also granted a significant increase in strength. ''Humansize'' lasted for at least six minutes (longer for more experienced casters) and then the target and all its enlarged accoutrements shrank back to normal. If cast on oneself, the caster could cancel the spell at any time. To all observers, the target of ''humansize'' appeared to be human and the change could not be detected by any means except possibly ''[[true seeing]]''.''[[Demihuman Deities]]'' says ''true seeing'' will reveal the true race of the spell's target, but the ''[[Priest's Spell Compendium Volume Two]]'' says the true race cannot be discovered even by magical means.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]], and [[somatic component]]s to cast, including touching the target halfling."
