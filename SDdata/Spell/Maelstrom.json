        "mainbody": "Maelstrom was a divine magic spell available to priests of Umberlee, the Sea Queen, and to others that followed a deity associated with the ocean. It created a whirlpool in a body of water that sucked in creatures and objects.\nThis spell was only viable when cast upon a body of water that was at least  deep in a cylinder at least  in diameter&mdashthe size of the maelstrom. It could be cast at a point on the surface up to  away (even farther for more experienced casters and for the newer version of the spell). The effect only lasted a short time, but was extremely dangerous and deadly as the water swirled rapidly and formed a vortex that pulled everything within  of the edges of the maelstrom down into a watery grinder. Creatures with enough strength or swimming ability could slow their descent and perhaps avoid the worst of the buffeting. Only the sturdiest sailing vessels and experienced crews could hope to avoid being sucked in and swamped.\nOnce trapped in the raging whirlpool, creatures, vessels, and objects were battered mercilessly until they were ejected from the bottom of the maelstrom far under water although some very large creatures or vessels could emerge at the top. For the earlier version of this spell, the victims were flung to a depth of 100 ft (30 m) in a random direction away from the center of the vortex, possibly impacting the sea bed or other underwater obstacles. Creatures unable to breathe water had to hold their breath until they breached the surface or be drowned.\nWhen the spell expired, all creatures and objects still floating within the maelstrom took no further damage and slowly spiraled to the surface with the water as it returned to its natural level.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of the priests holy symbol or divine focus. The Umberlant version also required a drop of water blessed by the goddess herself or one of her senior clergy."
