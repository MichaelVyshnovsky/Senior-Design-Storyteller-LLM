        "mainbody": "'''''Maelstrom''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to priests of [[Umberlee]], the Sea Queen, and to others that followed a deity associated with the ocean. It created a whirlpool in a body of water that sucked in creatures and objects.",
        "Effects": "This spell was only viable when cast upon a body of water that was at least {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} deep in a cylinder at least {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} in diameter&mdash;the size of the ''maelstrom''. It could be cast at a point on the surface up to {{SI|420|ft|long=yes}} away (even farther for more experienced casters and for the newer version of the spell). The effect only lasted a short time, but was extremely dangerous and deadly as the water swirled rapidly and formed a vortex that pulled everything within {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} of the edges of the ''maelstrom'' down into a watery grinder. Creatures with enough strength or swimming ability could slow their descent and perhaps avoid the worst of the buffeting. Only the sturdiest sailing vessels and experienced crews could hope to avoid being sucked in and swamped.\n\nOnce trapped in the raging whirlpool, creatures, vessels, and objects were battered mercilessly until they were ejected from the bottom of the ''maelstrom'' far under water although some very large creatures or vessels could emerge at the top. For the earlier version of this spell, the victims were flung to a depth of 100 ft (30 m) in a random direction away from the center of the vortex, possibly impacting the sea bed or other underwater obstacles. Creatures unable to breathe water had to hold their breath until they breached the surface or be drowned.\n\nWhen the spell expired, all creatures and objects still floating within the ''maelstrom'' took no further damage and slowly spiraled to the surface with the water as it returned to its natural level.",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of the priest's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]]. The Umberlant version also required a drop of water blessed by the goddess herself or one of her senior clergy."
