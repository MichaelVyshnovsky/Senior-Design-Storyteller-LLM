It had strict limitations, for example it could predict how sentries would react to a disturbance but it couldnt predict the issue of a battle. As for other similar spells, the granted knowledge was always relevant and correct, although it could be incomplete or cryptic.\nThis spell had a cool-down period of one day before it could be cast again.\nA gem with a value of at least 500 gp was required to cast this spell, in addition to verbal and somatic components.\nDivine Inspiration was one of the spells priests could learn by reading Wythyndles Round Book.\nCategoryDivination spells\nCategoryCleric spells\nCategoryMonk spells\nCategoryYear of Miracles\n6d5iy8urjxqblft1ybvp22q1h38wt65"
