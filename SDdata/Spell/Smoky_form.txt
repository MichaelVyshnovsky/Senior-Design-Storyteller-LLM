'''''Smoky form''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell transformed a wu jen into a mass of thick smoke. The wu jen's clothing and equipment were also transformed. The spell also affected any creature in physical contact with the wu jen at casting. The resulting cloud of smoke had the same shape and appearance as the individual. For the duration of the spell, an individual was immune to physical attacks. Further spells couldn't be cast while the wu jen was in smoke form. 

While the actual mass of the individual was not altered, their weight became the same as smoke. So an individual in ''smoky form'' couldn't squeeze through cracks in a wall, but could drift down from cliff. While in ''smoky form'', the individual was vulnerable to wind, which caused them to move in directions they could not control. Spells such as ''[[gust of wind]]'' or ''[[wind breath]]'' inflicted damage to an individual in ''smoky form'', and the ''[[divine wind]]'' spell killed the individual.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], some burning [[incense]].
