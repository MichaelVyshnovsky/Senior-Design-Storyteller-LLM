Rattle was a haunting cantrip that initiate wizards could learn. It created an auditory illusion of the clinking sound produced by chains made of metal.
This cantrip was a variation of groan that created an illusion of the sound given off by the movement of chains. The sound appeared to come from within  from the caster.The original description of this spell in Dragon #60 used the 1-edition nomenclature 1", meaning  indoors and  outdoors. This was simplified to the shorter range in Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four. The caster could choose to imitate metal chains or some other method of making a similar sound, like coins being poured from a pouch, for example. The spot chosen for the emanation of the sound could be anywhere within the range, regardless of barriers, walls, or containers. Creatures in close proximity that could be expected to hear the sound had a chance to resist the spell. If successful, they not aware of the illusion.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster named a device that could rattle and moved a hand rapidly, as if shaking a handful of chains.
