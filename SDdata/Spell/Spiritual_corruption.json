        "mainbody": "Spiritual corruption was a powerful divine enchantment spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Gargauth called Malefactors.\nThis vile spell tempted the heart and soul of a target. Pure-hearted targets were more likely to resist the spells effects than those with a gray or neutral view on life, but once cast, the effects of spiritual corruption could only be removed by a wish, limited wish, or directly by a deity. This spell had no effect if cast upon dark-hearted individuals.\nOne day after the spell was cast the target would face a minor moral dilemma. If they failed to make the correct choice then the spiritual corruption would begin to take root. If they made the righteous choice then the spell would end. The target would face a stronger moral dilemma on the second day but find it more difficult to resist the temptation of evil. This process continued for seven days with the targets ability to discern right from wrong weakening with each passing day. If, during the seventh test, the target chose the righteous path then the spell would end. However, if the target chose poorly then the spell would still end but their heart would be forever twisted toward evil and yearn to worship Gargauth.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a piece of fruit that looked ripe on the outside but was rotten within to cast."
