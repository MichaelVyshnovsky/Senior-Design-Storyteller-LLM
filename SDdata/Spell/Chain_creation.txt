'''''Chain creation''''' was a [[divine]] [[evocation]] spell that multiplied the effects of certain spells.

==Effects==
The effects of this spell only took hold when cast within ten minutes of the casting of ''[[minor creation]]'' or a divine spell from the [[creation sphere]]. It failed if cast under other circumstances or if it affected anything to do with the [[undead]].

When it was cast, ''chain creation'' functioned as three duplicate castings of the previously-cast spell. The duplicated effects were permanent in nature, as were any objects created by their casting.

==History==
This spell was inscribed within the holy [[relic]] called the ''[[Tome of the Morning]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required three [[rubies]] worth at least 100 [[gp]] or the dust taken from four such rubies.
