Hallucinatory forest was an illusion spell that made a large area appear to be a real forest permanently. The reverse of this spell, revealed wood, removed this illusion.
A druid could turn an area the size of a 40 ft (12.2 m) square per level of experience into an illusory forest that looked, smelled, sounded, and felt just like the real thing. Other druids and intelligent forest-dwelling creatures (centaurs, dryads, green dragons, nymphs, satyrs, treants, etc.) could recognize the illusion, but unless a creature had an affinity with woodlands, they believed the phantasm unquestioningly and acted accordingly.
The reverse of this spell exactly countered hallucinatory forest. It could also be dispelled.
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. Some druids required mistletoe as their material component.
