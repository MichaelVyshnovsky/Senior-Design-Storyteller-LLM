'''''Hallucinatory forest''''' was an [[illusion]] spell that made a large area appear to be a real forest permanently. The reverse of this spell, '''''revealed wood''''', removed this illusion.

==Effects==
A druid could turn an area the size of a 40 ft (12.2 m) square per level of experience into an illusory forest that looked, smelled, sounded, and felt just like the real thing. Other druids and intelligent forest-dwelling creatures ([[centaur]]s, [[dryad]]s, [[green dragon]]s, [[nymph]]s, [[satyr]]s, [[treant]]s, etc.) could recognize the illusion, but unless a creature had an affinity with woodlands, they believed the phantasm unquestioningly and acted accordingly.

The reverse of this spell exactly countered ''hallucinatory forest''. It could also be ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]''.

==Components==
Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were required to cast this spell. Some druids required [[mistletoe]] as their [[material component]].
