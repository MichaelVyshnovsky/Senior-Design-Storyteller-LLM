'''''Deadly driderform''''' was a rare [[illusion]] [[spell]] that granted the subject that appearance of a [[drider]] for a limited time.

==Effects==
When activated, the ''deadly driderform'' spell granted the target a lower body of a giant [[spider]], while leaving their torso unchanged. This form was not a true transformation yet it granted the subject the increased skittering speed of a drider and boosted strength as well as defenses.

==History==
[[File:Deadly Driderform 2.png|thumb|415px|''A male warrior under the effects of deadly driderform.'']]
These illusory transformations where known to be used by adventurers of the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], after they descended into the [[Underdark]] to opposed [[Gromph Baenre]]'s plot to send [[Menzoberranzan]] into the [[Abyss]].
