        "mainbody": "Globe of invulnerability was an arcane abjuration spell that created a protective barrier around the caster.\nFor up to one minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating, the spell created a shimmering fixed spherical barrier centered on the caster that canceled the effects of any spell that was originally less powerful than globe of invulnerability.\nThe spell needed verbal, somatic and material components to be cast. Its material component could be either a glass or a crystal bead that shattered when the spell ended.\nThe material component could be replaced by the use of an arcane focus.\nThe spell was developed by Netherese arcanist Trebbe in , and was originally called Trebbes invulnerability."
