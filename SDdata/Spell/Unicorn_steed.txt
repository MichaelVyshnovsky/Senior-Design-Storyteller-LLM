'''''Unicorn steed''''' was a [[divine]] [[conjuration]]/[[enchantment]] [[spell]] that brought forth a [[unicorn]] to the caster. The [[magical beast]] made itself available as a steed and companion for a day. This spell could only be cast by the faithful of [[Mielikki]] and of [[Gwaeron Windstrom]].

==Components==
When ''unicorn steed'' was cast, the [[cleric]] summoned or gently compelled a nearby unicorn to their service. The majestic creature served as a steed and even fought alongside the caster during the spell's duration, which was a single day. While it would carry the caster and their possessions if not too much, it would carry no one else. The caster and the unicorn had a limited telepathic bond, making them aware of each other's intentions and state of mind. The unicorn could not attack, throw, hurt, or even play tricks on the caster. While the unicorn was obedient to the caster, if it was mistreated (such as by misuse or by being sent alone into danger) the spell's effects could be ended prematurely by the powers of Mielikki or her followers.

Each individual unicorn could only be affected by this spell once in its lifetime. If it was in range of a subsequent casting, it could sense its pull but chose whether or not to answer the spell's call. If it did, the caster remained unaware that the unicorn was free and able to leave whenever it wished.

Uniquely, this was the only spell known to affect a unicorn in this way. Mielikki herself forbade anyone not of her faith from using this spell by any means, such as from a [[scroll]].

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s three hairs taken from the mane or tail of a unicorn.

==History==
The specifications of this spell were inscribed within the holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]], ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', and a very few other very rare tomes.
