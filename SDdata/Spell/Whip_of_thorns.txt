Whip of thorns was a druidic transmutation spell that transformed a small piece of vine into a long, thorn-covered whip.
The spell created a 15-long (4.6 m) thorny whip that appeared in the hand of the caster. It could be wielded with notable proficiency, regardless of their previous combat prowess. Any time the caster successfully lashed a creature or person of sufficient size, they could release the whip and entangle the creature in vines for a matter of moments. As the creature attempted to free itself, their flesh was torn into and barbed by the vines thorns.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small piece of vine in order to be cast.
