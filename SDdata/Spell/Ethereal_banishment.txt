Ethereal banishment was an alteration spell of the southern magic tradition that transported one creature to the Ethereal plane and kept it there for a limited time. It was often used on opponents, who had a chance to resist the magic.
Apart from verbal and somatic components this spell required either a drop of oil gained from a creature from the Ethereal Plane or a drop of oil of etherealness.
Ethereal banishment was a spell developed in the southern magic tradition of Mulhorand, Unther and Chessenta. There it was also simply known as etherealness, but was distinct from the related spell of the same name used elsewhere.
