'''''Ethereal banishment''''' was an [[alteration]] spell of the [[southern magic]] tradition{{Southernmagic}} that transported one creature to the [[Ethereal plane]] and kept it there for a limited time. It was often used on opponents, who had a chance to resist the magic.

==Components==
Apart from verbal and somatic components this spell required either a drop of oil gained from a creature from the Ethereal Plane or a drop of ''[[oil of etherealness]]''.

==Users==
''Ethereal banishment'' was a spell developed in the [[southern magic]] tradition of [[Mulhorand]], [[Unther]] and [[Chessenta]]. There it was also simply known as '''''etherealness''''', but was distinct from the [[Etherealness|related spell of the same name]] used elsewhere.<ref>
