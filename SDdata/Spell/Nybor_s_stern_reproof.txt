Nybors stern reproof was an enchantment spell that caused intense, debilitating pain within a target person or creature.
The agony caused by stern reproof was so excruciating that it could instantly kill the affected creature. It was far away more intense than the pain caused by Nybors gentle reminder and Nybors mild admonishment and could continue much longer, depending on the will of the caster.
