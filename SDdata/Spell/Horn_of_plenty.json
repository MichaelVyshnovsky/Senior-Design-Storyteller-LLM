        "mainbody": "Horn of plenty was a spell used by clerics of Yondalla.\nWhen cast on a hollow horn, it transformed into a cornucopia filled with fresh fruit, vegetables and grain. It provided a days worth of food for up to six medium creatures or two large creature. Once the food was removed, the cornucopia then provided a days worth of either ale, water or wine. The type of food and liquid provided was determined by the caster. The caster had to ensure there was enough containers to catch the food and liquids. Once the spell expired, the cornucopia once again became a regular hollowed out horn, but the food and liquid it provided remained.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Yondalla."
