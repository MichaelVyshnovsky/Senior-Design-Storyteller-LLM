Astaroths augmentation was a divine alteration spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Gargauth called Malefactors.
Malefactors used this spell to permanently enhance their attributes by calling on Gargauths divine power. Gargauth extracted a heavy price in exchange for this power, demanding the caster corrupt an individual in power or sacrifice a helpless sentient creature every three months in his name. If the caster ever broke this contract then Gargauth would not only remove the bestowed power for the appropriate attribute, but would proceed to weaken the caster in the same attribute. 
The caster could enter into multiple pacts with Gargauth by casting this spell over and over again, but nothing short of a wish or divine intervention could separate the caster from the pact without incurring Gargauths wrath.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components three yellow feathers, a ruby worth at least 25 gp and the priests holy symbol to cast.
