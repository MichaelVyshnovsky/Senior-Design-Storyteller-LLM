Dread whisper was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
Wizards used this spell on a target and spoke of a terrible outcome that would happen if the target did not ignore the caster. For this spell to work the target and caster needed to speak the same language.
If the spell succeeds, the target would be unable to do anything relating to the caster for the spells duration. If they did anything relating to the caster the target would stand helpless as horrible images assaulted their mind.
Wizards used this spell to keep people from mentioning the wizards presence, usually in regard to the wizard being in a place where they were not supposed to be.
This spell could only be used by evil wizards.
This spell did not require physical components to cast.
