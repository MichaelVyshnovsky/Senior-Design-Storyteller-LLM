        "mainbody": "Dying curse was a protection spell of the southern magic tradition that allowed a caster to have vengeance after death.\nAnyone who killed the caster would suffer the effects of a major curse spell. The spell took effect even if the caster was later resurrected. The curse was permanent until it was removed.\nThe only way to remove the curse was by a wish, remove bane, or remove major curse spell.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components."
