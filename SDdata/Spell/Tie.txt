'''''Tie''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that beginning [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It caused the end of a rope-like item to form a knot around another object of similar shape.

==Effects==
This spell worked on rope-like objects from as small as a thread to as large as a cable. The object to be connected had to be within {{SI|1|ft|c|long=yes}} of the rope (with enough slack to form a knot) and had to resemble a rope in some fashion (a ring, loop, rod, another rope, or the end of the same rope) for the knot to be completed. Any common knot (square, half-hitch, bowline ''etc.'') familiar to the caster could be tied.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The name of the knot was spoken as the caster held up three fingers.

==History==
The untitled book known as ''[[Briel's Book of Shadows]]'' described this cantrip along with ''[[exterminate]]'', ''[[wilt]]'', and ''[[smokepuff]]''.{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|34}}<ref group="note">The four cantrips described in [[Dragon magazine 97|''Dragon'' #97]] were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''.
