'''''Earth walk''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Dumathoin]].

==Effects==
When cast, this spell allowed the caster, as well as their clothing and equipment, to pass through earth and stone as if walking normally, similar to how a [[xorn]] travels underground. The caster could use this spell to trap a creature, where they remained trapped until they perspired or were freed with a ''[[freedom]]'' spell. If ''[[phase door]]'' was cast on the caster while they traveled through stone, they were instantly slain.

==Components==
This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components.
