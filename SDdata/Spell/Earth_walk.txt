Earth walk was a spell used by clerics of Dumathoin.
When cast, this spell allowed the caster, as well as their clothing and equipment, to pass through earth and stone as if walking normally, similar to how a xorn travels underground. The caster could use this spell to trap a creature, where they remained trapped until they perspired or were freed with a freedom spell. If phase door was cast on the caster while they traveled through stone, they were instantly slain.
This spell required verbal and somatic components.
