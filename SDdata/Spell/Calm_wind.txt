'''''Calm wind''''' was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] spell that could reduce strong winds to a light breeze in a localized area.

==Effects==
This spell could be cast out to a distance of 360 yd (330 m) and affect a circular area at least 180 ft (55 m) in radius (larger for more experienced casters). The effects lasted at least 90 minutes with higher level casters able to extend the duration. ''Calm wind'' reduced the wind speed in the area of effect to a gentle breeze. If cast in the middle of a tempest, it created an "eye of the storm" in which the violent winds raged around the protected circle. This spell did not affect precipitation, fog, or wave action, so a storm could still adversely impact a ship and its crew in other ways. If cast upon already becalmed conditions, ''calm wind'' had no effect.

==Components==
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.

==History==
This spell was associated with the pirates that roamed the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].
