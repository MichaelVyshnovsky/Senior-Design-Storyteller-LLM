        "mainbody": "'''''Moonglow''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] used to conjure faint light.",
        "Effects": "This spell created a faint bluish white light resembling the natural light of the moon. The light was centered on an item chosen by the caster. Anything larger than an average [[human]] would only be partially illuminated by the spell. The caster needed to see the subject to center the spell upon it.\n\nThough the light created was not bright enough to read small scripts, larger markings were easily discernible.\n\nContact with any spell that created magical darkness would cancel the spell.",
        "Components": "''Moonglow'' only required [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.",
        "Notable Uses": "The [[House of the Moon]], a temple to [[Sel√ªne]] in [[Waterdeep]], had outer walls painted with overlapping ''moonglow'' spells to display the faith's teachings."
