Master earth was a transmutation spell used by druids.
This spell allowed the caster to travel instantaneously through the earth to a destination of their choosing. There was no distance limitation for the spell provided the location was on the same plane of existence. Master earth only functioned on the Prime Material plane.
This spell could be used to travel to both specific or general locations.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a fossil of an animal to cast.
