        "mainbody": "Blight was a necromancy spell that bathed a creature or plant with necromantic energy.\nThe spell would effectively drain water and vitality from a creature, which would suffer serious necrotic damage. Undead and constructs were immune as they either didnt have or didnt need moisture. Plants would just wither and die unless they were plant creatures or a magical plant, in which case they would just have a disadvantage to resist the spell, If they failed, they would suffer the full damage of the spell. The strength of the necromantic damage inflicted onto a target is determined by the casters skill level.\nThe spell had verbal and somatic components.In Players Handbook v.3.5, this spell also required a divine focus."
