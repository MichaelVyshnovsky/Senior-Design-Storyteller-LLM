Krynnspace was the crystal sphere that contained the planet Krynn and the other planets of its system.
Krynnspace was part of a triangular configuration in the flow of the phlogiston that also included Realmspace and Greyspace. The flow allowed one-way spelljammer travel from Krynnspace to Realmspace, as well as one-way travel from Greyspace to Krynnspace.
The sphere included at least three planets besides Krynn that were known to some people from Realmspace
* Chislev the fourth planet from this spheres sun and the least populous in terms of human and demihuman life. It was visited by explorers from Shou Lung, who classified it as a live world.
* Sirion a fiery planet that was the closest to this spheres sun. It was occasionally inhabited by azer and efreet, who would sell basalt sculptures to spelljamming visitors that fetched a high price on Toril.
* Ziviliyn the fifth planet from this spheres sun, this was an air body that was surrounded by twelve moons. One of these moons, known as Morgion, was often visited to collect the plants that grew on it. These fetched a high price on Toril.
The crystal shell of Krynnspace was significantly larger than that of Realmspace, having a diameter of . The wildspace of this sphere was also much colder than that of Realmspace, with clouds of freezing vapor often being found in orbit around planets.
Much like Realmspace, this sphere had a number of small portals to the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Radiance that were seen by inhabitants as stars and constellations, which clerics in Krynns past determined represented each of their worlds major deities. And that the actions of the gods cause them to disappear, rearrange themselves, or often appear in new patterns.
The Crimson Caravan trading company made frequent trips between Realmspace, Greyspace, and Krynnspace, transporting goods from those spheres.
In the mid-14 century DR, travelers from Realmspace had spread knowledge of deities such as Malar, Torm, and Tyr into Krynnspace. In particular, the gods and customs of Kara-Tur were met with interest by local inhabitants.
A number of inhabitants of Krynnspace traveled to Realmspace on occasion. Notable inhabitants included
* Emilo Haversack, a kender from Krynn.
* Jasmine, winged member of Finders Band.
* Tempest Ruse, a pirate captain who lived briefly on Toril in the mid-14 century DR.
* Teldin Moore, a farmer from Krynn who traveled to Realmspace aboard a gnomish sidewheeler in the mid-14 century DR.
