        "mainbody": "Ravel was a reversed cantrip that acolyte wizards could learn. It undid the results of the stitch cantrip, or exploited a flaw in a seam to further degrade the integrity of the binding.\nThis cantrip completely reversed a single stitch cantrip, but otherwise required a loose or broken thread as a starting place for the unweaving. This cantrip had no effect on magic items.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster spoke the name of the spell while pantomiming plucking at a loose thread."
