Sunstroke was a divine alteration spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Horus-Re called Sunhawks.
This spell caused a target to experience heat stroke for the spells duration, increasing their body temperature by one degree every minute. This spell had no effect on undead or creatures immune to heat or fire. Cold-blooded animals would become more sluggish with each passing minute.
The effects of this spell would cease if dispel magic, remove curse, cure disease, or heal was cast.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the Sunhawks holy symbol and a piece of flammable material to cast.
