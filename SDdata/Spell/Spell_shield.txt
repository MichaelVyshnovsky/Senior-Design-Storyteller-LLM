Spell shield was a spell sometimes used by abjurers, clerics and incantatrixes. Otherwise it was rarely used.
When cast, the spell bestowed a strong defense against some magical attacks, effects, and spells. The caster either cast the spell on themselves or on another individual. To cast the spell onto another individual, the caster had to physically touch the targeted individual.
The specifications of this spell could be displayed by the relic known as the Scepter of Mystra.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a diamond. The diamond could be of any grade or size. It was consumed by the spell during casting. The divine version of this spell required only verbal and somatic components.
