Holy might was a divine alteration spell that allowed a priest to fortify an object, made of inorganic materials, so that it did not decompose or degrade over time.
This spell affected a mass of non-organic material no larger than twice the size of the casters body. When cast, any weaknesses in the targeted material were strengthened, fortified from future damage and made even more hardy.
The material components of this spell included a whole gem either a ruby, sapphire or emerald worth at least 3,000 gp a similarly sized piece of duskwood a chunk of obsidian of any size some acid taken from a black dragon and a piece of chitin taken from either an ankheg, bulette, or beholder.
