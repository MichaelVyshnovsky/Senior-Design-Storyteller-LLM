'''''Accuracy''''' was a common spell used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]] that affected the range of missile weapons. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
The spell added a temporary enchantment to both magical and normal missiles, which greatly increased their accuracy and range. The enchantment was only applied to missiles that could be fired or thrown by a [[humanoid]]; the spell had no effect on a missile fired from a [[catapult]] or [[ballista]]. The spell also did not affect missiles thrown by large creatures such as [[giant]]s or [[dragon]]s. 

The enchanted missile emitted a faint glow. The enchantment remained on a missile until the spell expired, so there was a risk of an enemy recovering and firing the enchanted missile back at the caster. 

The reverse of this spell was ''[[inaccuracy]]''. This spell was applied to a creature. Once cast, the enchanted creature was a difficult target to strike, with missiles acting as if shot from an greater range than in reality. For example, an arrow fired at short range would act as if fired from medium range.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s. A wu jen would use a brush and [[ink]] to write the mystical character on the missile to be enchanted. The reverse of the spell, ''inaccuracy'', required a piece of ground glass.
