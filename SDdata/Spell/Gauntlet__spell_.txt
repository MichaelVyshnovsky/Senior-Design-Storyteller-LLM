Gauntlet was a wizard spell that created a magical glove.
This spell created a translucent glove of magical force around one of the casters hands. The magical gauntlet could not be crushed by any physical means and the caster could remove his hand from the gauntlet and have it remain in place for the duration of the spell. Additionally the caster could safely handle any materials with the gauntlet that would normally damage their skin. The gauntlet was also impervious to any diseases including those of a magical nature such as mummy rot. Nothing, including other spell effects, could stick to the gauntlet.
The caster could punch and strike with the gauntlet to great effect. The major drawback of casting this spell was that it prevented the caster from casting other spells involving somatic components while their hand was inside of the gauntlet. The caster could banish the gauntlet at any time, even from great distances, with nothing but a thought.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a piece of clear glass or rock crystal about the size of the casters hand to cast.
