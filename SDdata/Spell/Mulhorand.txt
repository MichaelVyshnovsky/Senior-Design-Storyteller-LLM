'''Mulhorand''' ({{Pronounce|muhl|HOH|rand|refs=<ref>}}) was one of the [[Old Empires]] in eastern [[Faerûn]]. The Mulhorandi were brought to [[Toril]] from [[Earth]] by the [[Imaskar|Imaskar Empire]] looking for some manpower. After countless praises, [[Ao]] contacted [[Ptah]] who led a part of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] to Toril. Ironically, their rival in the millennia to come was another human tribe captured by the [[Imaskari]] at the same time, which founded the empire of [[Unther]].

Mulhorand was destroyed by the [[Spellplague]] and the empire of [[High Imaskar]] came to comprise its former territories. After the [[Chosen]] of the Mulhorandi gods appeared around the time of the [[Second Sundering]], however, they and the wizard [[Nezram]] rallied the [[Mulan]] to overthrow the Imaskari once more, driving them into the [[Plains of Purple Dust]].

{{TOC limit|4}}

==People and Culture==
The populace of Mulhorand was primarily composed of [[humans]] of three primary ethnic factions: the [[Mulan]], the [[Turami]], and slaves from [[Thay]] known as [[Tethyrian|Tethens]]. Other races proved hesitant to follow the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] upon the nation's founding, and were exiled at that time; the non-human population remained low as a result. Mulhorand utilized a caste system with three social classes:

; Nobility :Members of Mulhorand's nobility took positions in the nation's government, often as [[priest]]s, [[wizard]]s, or bureaucrats. These individuals shaved their heads and painted a series of one to three blue circles on their foreheads to indicate social standing and education.

; Middle Class :Mulhorand's middle class was composed of landowners and craftsmen. Members of this social class were often wealthy, and were considered for marriages by members of the nobility as a result.

; [[Slavery|Slaves]] :The majority of people in Mulhorand fell into this category. Slaves were owned by the different clergies of the nation, and were guaranteed humane treatment by law. Despite this, the life of these individuals was a hard one, though less so than typically experienced by slaves in other nations.

After the reformation of Mulhorand in [[1487 DR]], the deities of the Mulhorandi pantheon abolished slavery altogether.

===Society===
[[File:Pharaoh.png|thumb|300px|right|''The [[pharaoh]] of Mulhorand.'']]
The people of Mulhorand were arrogant individuals that considered themselves better than any rival nation. Law was paramount to the nation's citizens, and change was avoided whenever possible. The government was run by the clergies devoted to the deities of the Mulhorandi pantheon, with the church of [[Horus-Re]] being foremost in power. However, despite the peaceful existence these priests sought to create, the different priesthoods were plagued by infighting, bickering, and struggles. These conflicts occurred both within their individual orders and against those of other faiths.

After the reformation of Mulhorand in 1487 DR, the deities of the Mulhorandi pantheon set aside their differences and focused in rebuilding the country, leading to a peaceful existence between their clergies.

===Customs===
As a theocratic nation, clergy of the Mulhorandi deities were treated with great respect and honor. Priests expected special treatment from the community, and held authority in all matters; public prayers were performed daily. The wealthy Mulhorandi also spent time planning and constructing personal tombs, preparing for their deaths and their continued life thereafter.

====Holidays====
On [[Midsummer]], the people of Mulhorand honored their gods with performaces of the [[Divinity Plays]].

===Language===
Peoples native to Mulhorand spoke [[Mulhorandi language|Mulhorandi]], a language that remained largely true to the [[Rauric languages|tongue]] spoken by the [[Mulan]] peoples upon their arrival to Faerûn. In its written form, it was composed of complex pictographs used to communicate ideas and concepts.

==Economy==
===Slavery===
The majority of Mulhorand's people were slaves, with roughly equal numbers in the cities and five-to-one slaves to freemen in the countryside, though they only counted as seven-tenths of a person on the census. The slaves were functionally synonymous with the lower class, with free people making up the middle and upper classes. All enslaved people were owned by the land's temples, who then rented them out to customers, and they were bound by an oath to obey the gods and those that the gods placed above them. A curious aspect of this system was that Mulhorandi slaves were surprisingly haughty and considered themselves better than their foreign fellows, as they believed that they were not the property of mortal men but entrusted to the care of the gods themselves, with the temples as the intermediary.

Though most slaves toiled in hardship, many received proper educations and served in the realm's bureaucracies. They were guaranteed humane treatment by law and were generally treated better than slaves in other lands; their working conditions were regularly inspected and any abuse or neglect was considered vandalism towards the temple, and killing a slave was a capital crime. The priesthood of [[Osiris]] was responsible for overseeing the welfare of all slaves, and any slave who felt that they were being mistreated was expected to call on them to dispense justice, which usually involved the forfeiture of lands and other assets. It was not uncommon for a master to directly pay their slaves as they returned to temple custody, with it seen as a form of virtuous piety.

During the 1350s DR, the vizier [[Rezim]] proposed radical changes to Mulhorand's society. He wished to allow temples to directly sell slaves to nobles, with no oversight over their treatment, and claimed that it would improve economic efficiency. This proposal made him greatly unpopular with the [[Pharaoh]] and other people of influence due to its obvious favoring of his political backers.

When Mulhorand conquered [[Unther]] in the 1370s DR, much of its efforts there went to controlling sudden slave revolts, and integrating the population into temple service. As the army of Mulhorand was controlled by the priests of [[Anhur]], most of the "liberated" slaves were seized by the temple of Anhur. Some of the most capable and enthusiastic of these slaves were sent back to Unther with training and equipment, with the mission of finding and destroying the remaining Untheric resistance.

==Geography==
Mulhorand was located in an arid region stretching between the [[River of the Dawn]] in the north to the [[Lake of Salt]] in the south. The nation's western border was marked by the [[River of Swords]], and it possessed no established border to the east. Its deserts, mountains, fields, and other geological features fell into four distinct divisions:

===Menesankh===
{{main|Menesankh}}
This region of flat plains, also called the ''Plain of Life'', extended south from the city of [[Skuld]] to the [[River of Swords]]. The area was heavily irrigated and featured occasional marshes.

===Asanibis===
{{main|Asanibis}}
Also known as the [[Great Vale]], this region lay between the [[Sword Mountains (Mulhorand)|Sword Mountains]] and the Menesankh, and included the majority of Mulhorand's farmlands.

===Furitep===
{{main|Furitep}}
The mountainous regions of Mulhorand, including the [[Sunrise Mountains]] and the Sword Mountains, composed the Furitep. 

===Taranoth===
{{main|Taranoth}}
This region was composed of high plains that lay between the cities of Skuld and [[Sultim]].

===Bodies of Water===
The [[Alamber Sea]] bordered Mulhorand on the west. This sea harbored both pirates and [[sahuagin]] within its area. Sahuagin raiders posed a constant problem for the port city Sultim.

===Deserts===
The [[Plains of Purple Dust]] were located in eastern Mulhorand. The faintly magical sands of this area were home to [[purple worm]]s, nomads, and other hostile creatures. Connections to the [[Underdark]] were also common in this region. [[Raurin]], the Dust Desert, was a wasteland hiding numerous ruins and forgotten magic. This region was also home to [[dragon]]s and [[efreet]]i.

===Mountains===
The Dragonsword Mountains in central Mulhorand were considered impassable due to a large monster population

===Plains===
The [[Cliffs of Leaping Horses]] was a region of plains considered to be the [[horse]] land of Mulhorand.

===Rivers===
The River of the Dawn was Mulhorand's northernmost river and served as a boundary between the nations of Mulhorand and [[Thay]]. The [[River of Shadows]] was named after the city of Skuld, which lay near the river's delta. The water from the [[River of Spears]] was used to irrigate the farmlands of the Great Vale. The [[River of Swords]] served as the border between the nations of Mulhorand and [[Unther]] in the years prior to the Spellplague, and, in the 15th century DR, between Mulhorand and [[Tymanther]].

===Cities===
Skuld was the capital of Mulhorand. Skuld was also recognized as the oldest continually inhabited city in Faerûn. [[Gheldaneth]] was a port city that housed Mulhorand's [[Arcanum of Magic|Great University]] and the [[Wizard College (Gheldaneth)|Wizard College]]. Sultim was Mulhorand's largest port, and the center of the worship of [[Anhur]]. [[Neldorild]] was relatively new (as of the 14th century DR) and was constantly growing. Its community served as a retreat for both the wealthy and retired. [[Mishtan]] was a town ruled by the church of [[Osiris]]. It served as the home of the Mulhorandi that worked to expand the nearby [[Land of the Dead]].

==Navy and Seafaring==
Mulhorandi vessels were named after sea creatures or sea-related myths.

==History==
[[File:Mulhorandi BG2 concept art.jpg|thumb|''A Mulhorandi couple in traditional garb.'']]
===Arrival, Slavery and Freedom===
In response to a plague that killed much of its people, the Imaskar Empire captured over one hundred thousand humans through the use of two portals opened to another world. These portals were then closed and all connections between the two worlds were sealed; the captured peoples, now called the Mulan, were enslaved by the Imaskari. 

The Imaskari barrier inhibited contact between the Mulan and their deities. However, Ao intervened and allowed mortal [[avatar|manifestation]]s of these deities to bypass the barrier and enter Toril directly.

In {{Yearlink|-1967}}, war broke out between Mulhorand and Unther. The conflict ended in {{Yearlink|-1961}} when the ruling deities agreed upon the River of Swords as a common border between their two nations.

===The Orcgate War===
{{Main|Orcgate Wars}}
In the year {{Yearlink|-1081}} the [[Thayd|Theurgist Adept Thayd]] opened a portal to a world populated by [[gray orc]]s. Thayd was executed shortly after for inciting rebellion, and the portal remained forgotten until discovered by the orcs. In the year {{Yearlink|-1076}}, the humanoids invaded Mulhorand and Unther, beginning what later became known as the [[Orcgate Wars]].

The invading orcs possessed the ability to summon the [[avatar]]s of their deities. The divine manifestations of the Mulhorandi and [[Untheric pantheon]]s faced those of the [[orc pantheon]] in what later became known as the [[Battle of the Gods]], a clash that resulted in the death of the Mulhorandi deity [[Re]] at the hands of [[Gruumsh]] in {{Yearlink|-1071}}. The conflict continued until the Mulhorandi and Untheric pantheons allied to defeat the invading force in {{Yearlink|-1069}}.

===Decline and Recovery===
In the wake of the Orcgate Wars, Mulhorand began a prolonged decline in power. Its daughter states broke free and formed the nations of Murghôm, [[Semphar]], and [[Thay]]. This decline continued until the [[Time of Troubles]], at which time the Imaskari barrier was dissolved by Ao. The divine manifestations that had ruled for centuries rejoined their primary essences; Mulhorand was ruled by a true mortal king for the first time in its history. After a brief upheaval, the nation stabilized under the rule of the clergy.

===Untheric Crusade===
{{Main|Untheric Crusade}}
In response to the death of Unther's manifest deity [[Gilgeam|Gilgeam the Tyrant]], the [[pharaoh]], [[Horustep III]], allowed the clerics of Anhur to cross the River of Swords and invade their long time rival nation. Assisted by a mercenary company, the [[Gold Swords]], Mulhorand invaded Unther in [[1371 DR]].

===The Spellplague===
{{Main|Spellplague}}
No more than six years after the conquest of Unther, Mulhorand was destroyed by the Spellplague in [[1385 DR]]. Many of the Mulan people were killed during the alteration of the landscape and the few survivors that remained in Toril fled to other lands such as [[Chessenta]]. The Mulhorandi pantheon vanished without a trace.

Mulhorand soon became completely devoid of civilization, and the [[Deep Imaskari]] wizard [[Ususi Manaallin]] founded the empire of [[High Imaskar]] on its former territories, with immigrants from [[Deep Imaskar]] comprising most of its citizenry.

===The Mulhorandi rebellion===
{{Main|Mulhorandi rebellion}}
In the wake of the Second Sundering, when the gods of Faerûn began to pick Chosen to enact their will, several mortal descendants of the old Mulhorandi gods found themselves possessed by their divine ancestors and immediately began a war against the Imaskari. With the help of [[Nezram|Nezram the World-Walker]], the returned deities and their Mulan servants won out, driving the Imaskari east into the desert and began the process to rebuild their old nation again.
