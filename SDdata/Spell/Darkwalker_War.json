        "History": {
            "Pre-War and Outbreak": "The war began with a series of raids on coastal cantrevs in Corwell by the Northmen, accompanied by raids by the Bloodriders further inland. This caused the civilian Ffolk to flee towards their capital, [[Caer Corwell]] and Corwell Town. An attempt to pincer and slaughter the fleeing people was headed off at the [[Battle of Freeman's Down]].",
            "Confrontation": "Another part of the Northman fleet had been delayed fighting the [[Leviathan]], and later attacked Caer Corwell, but was driven back by druidic [[magic]]. The two armies laid siege to Caer Corwell. They advanced on the town of Corwell and overan its ill-prepared defenders, putting the town to the torch. The townsfolk and refugees fled to Caer Corwell with the aid of [[Robyn Moonsinger]]'s magic.\n\nThe firbolgs used [[battering ram]]s to enter the gatehouse, but were routed by the men-at-arms and dwarves. The Bloodriders then charged the breach, but were mostly destroyed by Robyn Moonsinger's magic, in combination with a feint by the Sisters of Synnoria. The Pack then arrived and fell upon the Northmen, routing them. Prince [[Tristan Kendrick]] confronted Kazgaroth in single combat. However, Kazgaroth withdrew when he ssaw the Bloodrider leader [[Laric]] capture Robyn.",
            "Post-War": "The subsequent slaying of Kazgaroth at the [[Darkwell]], death of Laric, the battle between the Leviathan and the Northman fleet, and the conflict between Erian and [[Canthus]] for leadership of the Pack, were closely associated with the Darkwalker War.\n\nThe war was commemorated in ''[[Keren's song]]''."
