        "mainbody": "The Darkwalker War was an epic conflict in the Moonshae Isles, which was triggered by the rise of the Beast, Kazgaroth.\nThe main goodly (and neutral) parties of the Darkwalker War were the Ffolk of Corwell, the druids, the elvish Sisters of Synnoria, the Pack, and a group of dwarves led by Finellen. The main parties evil side are Kazgaroth the Beast, the Northmen of Norland, the firbolgs, and the undead Bloodriders.\nCasualties of the war on the goodly side included Gavin, Carina, Aileen, Quinn Moonwane, Dynnatt, Koart, the Lord Mayor of Corwell, most of the Ffolk men-at-arms, many Ffolk civilians slaughtered in the raids,Â many of Finellens dwarves, and enough of the Pack to prevent the wolf collective from reforming for many years. On the evil side, casualties included most of the firbolgs, all the Bloodriders except Laric, and large numbers of Northmen. Thelgaar Ironhand, the Leviathan, Erian, and Arlen were killed in the events that led to the war.\nThe war began with a series of raids on coastal cantrevs in Corwell by the Northmen, accompanied by raids by the Bloodriders further inland. This caused the civilian Ffolk to flee towards their capital, Caer Corwell and Corwell Town. An attempt to pincer and slaughter the fleeing people was headed off at the Battle of Freemans Down.\nAnother part of the Northman fleet had been delayed fighting the Leviathan, and later attacked Caer Corwell, but was driven back by druidic magic. The two armies laid siege to Caer Corwell. They advanced on the town of Corwell and overan its ill-prepared defenders, putting the town to the torch. The townsfolk and refugees fled to Caer Corwell with the aid of Robyn Moonsingers magic.\nThe firbolgs used battering rams to enter the gatehouse, but were routed by the men-at-arms and dwarves. The Bloodriders then charged the breach, but were mostly destroyed by Robyn Moonsingers magic, in combination with a feint by the Sisters of Synnoria. The Pack then arrived and fell upon the Northmen, routing them. Prince Tristan Kendrick confronted Kazgaroth in single combat. However, Kazgaroth withdrew when he ssaw the Bloodrider leader Laric capture Robyn.\nThe subsequent slaying of Kazgaroth at the Darkwell, death of Laric, the battle between the Leviathan and the Northman fleet, and the conflict between Erian and Canthus for leadership of the Pack, were closely associated with the Darkwalker War.\nThe war was commemorated in Kerens song."
