'''''Animate tree''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] [[spell]] from the [[plant sphere]] that enable the [[druid]] to literally animate a tree.

==Effects==
When cast upon an ordinary tree, ''animate tree'' turned the tree into a [[treant]] of the same size for several minutes. When the spell expired the tree reverted to its normal form and rooted itself where it stood. This spell had no effect if cast upon a treant, but intelligent trees did have a chance to resist the spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] some [[mistletoe]] to cast.

==History==
[[Turlang]], a treant guardian of the [[High Forest]], could ''animate trees''.
