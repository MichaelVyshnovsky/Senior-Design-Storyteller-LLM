Animate tree was a divine enchantment spell from the plant sphere that enable the druid to literally animate a tree.
When cast upon an ordinary tree, animate tree turned the tree into a treant of the same size for several minutes. When the spell expired the tree reverted to its normal form and rooted itself where it stood. This spell had no effect if cast upon a treant, but intelligent trees did have a chance to resist the spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component some mistletoe to cast.
Turlang, a treant guardian of the High Forest, could animate trees.
