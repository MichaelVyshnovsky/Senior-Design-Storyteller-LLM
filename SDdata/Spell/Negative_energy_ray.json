        "mainbody": "Negative energy ray was a spell that dealt negative energy damage.\nWhen cast, this spell caused a beam of pure negative energy to shot out from the casters fingers. Any creature with this beam were weakened. Undead creatures struck with the beam were healed. The strength of the beam was determined by the casters skill level.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a mirror. The caster broke the mirror during casting."
