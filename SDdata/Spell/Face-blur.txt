Face-blur was a common illusion spell used by ninjas. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
A ninja was able to cast this spell on themselves or another person. If cast on another person, that person had to be willing to participate in the spell. The spell disguised the target by altering their face so that they appeared utterly unremarkable, and increased their ability to blend in with any crowd. Anyone who looked at the target forgot any identifying features. 
The spell was not always effective. It could not hide the appearance of a target from someone actively looking into a crowd, such as an attentive guard. The spell depended on the target to maintain an aura of dullness. Deliberately drawing attention to oneself caused the spell to expire. The spell was vulnerable to dispel magic.
The spell required only a somatic component, kuji-kiri hand gestures.
