        "mainbody": "irtelspace was a crystal sphere in the Arcane Inner Flow.\nPirtelspace was located halfway between Refugespace and Darnannonspace in the Arcane Inner Flow. The flow currents in the region allowed for two-way travel to both neighboring spheres.\nThe sphere of Pirtelspace was relatively cold, with temperatures in the outer regions dropping below freezing. There were two worlds, an asteroid belt, and an asteroid shell orbiting the single cool red star that lit the sphere.\n* Century was the outermost feature of the sphere, a frozen minor world that took 100 years to orbit the sun. It was a tidally locked planet inhabited by human barbarian tribes on the sunward side and drow on the dark side in the Lands of Grey Ice that formed the boundary between the two there was an ongoing war between the humans and drow.\n**Darkwatch was an elven military base established to keep a watch over the stranded drow, built on a small asteroid that orbited Century. It was inhabited by several hundred elves before the depredations of Blacklight caused it to fall into ruins.\n*Guinmirs Band was a sparse asteroid belt between Century and Archin containing rocks  in diameter. It was supposedly the remains of a planet called Guinmir, although some sages discounted that theory of asteroid belt formation.\n*Archin was a water world some  in diameter, inhabited by halflings, three separate human civilizations, and sea elves.\n**Skyport was a space port built by Antonius Pirtel, a grey disk of stone some  in diameter orbiting Archin perpendicular to the surface, with a featureless, circular tower rising  from the center of the disk.\n*The Mor Wake was a thick sphere of asteroids surrounding the sun, inhabited by various wildspace critters including night scavvers.\n**The Sea of Sorrow was a deadly sargasso that moved unpredictably around the Mor Wake, created when the Ice Mage Pirtel fought a pair of twin liches, using a sphere of annihilation to destroy one before the other twin opened a gate, and the collision of the sphere and gate catapulted the mages onto different planes, and created the Lichs Tear that was the heart and source of the sargasso.\nPirtelspace was originally discovered by Antonius Pirtel, who also built the Skydock.He built Skydock some five centuries before the adventures events.\nAt some point during the First Unhuman War, the Elven Imperial Fleet fought a large battle with a drow fleet that ended in elven victory when the drow crashed their fleet onto Century rather than surrender.\nAt one point, a group of spelljamming drow tried to use a stolen talisman of the spheres to transport their fleet from Realmspace to a new base in Pirtelspace."
