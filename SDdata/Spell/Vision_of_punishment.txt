Vision of punishment was a type of sanctified spell.
When cast upon an evil-aligned creature, this spell showed the targeted creature what awaited them in the afterlife. The vision of the tortuous and wretched fate that awaits their soul causes the targeted creature to become overwhelmed with intense nausea.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required both a divine focus and a sacrifice of the casters strength.
