Conjure aurumvorax was a spell granted by Garl Glittergold to his priests. The spell conjured an aurumvorax to attack the clerics enemies. The spell was dangerous, however, as the aurumvorax violently resisted commands to do anything other than attack or eat gold.
The spell magically created an aurumvorax, which would remain for at least 18 minutes if not slain. During that time, it could be directed to attack the summoners enemies. It became violent and unpredictable if called upon for any task other that attacking enemies or eating gold, going so far as to attack its own summoner depending on the situation.
The spell called for verbal and somatic components in addition to a figurine of an aurumvorax, worth at least 100 gold pieces. The priest needed to have his holy symbol on hand.
