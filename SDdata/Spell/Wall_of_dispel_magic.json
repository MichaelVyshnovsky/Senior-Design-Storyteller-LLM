        "mainbody": "'''''Wall of dispel magic''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that dissipated [[magic]].",
        "Effects": "On casting ''wall of dispel magic'', a wall was created. This wall was invisible; so invisible in fact that it was impossible to see with a ''[[see invisibility]]'' spell. It was also impossible to feel and one could easily pass through it as though nothing was there. However, people who passed through this wall came under the effect of a targeted ''[[dispel magic]]'' effect. A creature that was summoned could be dissipated by this spell. ''[[True seeing]]'' allowed a person to see both the invisible wall and its capacities.",
        "Components": "''Wall of dispel magic'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s and a [[divine focus]] if cast as a [[divine]] spell."
