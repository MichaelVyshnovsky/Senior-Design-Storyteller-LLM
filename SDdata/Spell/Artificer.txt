'''Artificers''' were a rare kind of [[arcane spellcaster]] who treated [[arcane magic|magic]] in the same manner as a mason might see a [[chisel]] as a tool for the creation of marvels. An artificer learned to wield their magic through the mastering of sigils and diagrams that they etched into that which they enchanted, as well as magical ingredients. Artificers infused objects of the world, be they inanimate or alive, with the power of the arcane, making them both powerful crafters and healers.{{cite dragon/365/Playtest: Artificer}}

==Culture==
[[File:Artificer_Class.jpg|thumb|left|125px|''A wrench bearing the symbol of the artificer.'']]
Artificers were also prominent in [[Lantan]].

===Religion===
Regardless of their race or origin, artificers were generally known to worship the god [[Gond]]. Though some were known to worship deities related to their pursuits of crafting or knowledge, such as [[Moradin]], [[Oghma]],{{cite dragon/403/Gond's Way: Artificers of the Realms|4}} or [[Torm]]. Others were known to worship gods of magic, such as [[Corellon]] or [[Mystra]]. But there were also some who saw little use for gods, instead aligning themselves with universities or wizard enclaves.

==Abilities==
[[Image:ArtificerClass.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A well-equipped artificer]]
Artificers, like [[swordmage]]s or [[wizard]]s, gained their ability to wield arcane magic through training and practice. However, unlike either, artificers approached magic in an almost scientific way, and manipulated arcane energy through complex patterns of arcane power known as sigils, which they etched onto their weapons, implements (such as [[rod]]s, [[staff]]s, or [[wand]]s), and other such items for use as components for their spellcasting. If they lacked these components, artificers could simply etch sigils onto a different item for use over a period of extended rest.

Through these sigils, artificers could craft magical items, brew potions, or even infuse themselves or allies with magically enhanced abilities. It was this latter ability that was the most directly applicable to combat, as artificers could use the ''healing infusion'' spell to heal the wounds or boost the morale of their allies. Artificers might also call their powers rotes or infusions, though the term "spell" remained the technically correct term for all varieties. An artificer's sigils and training also allowed them to cast [[ritual]]s, much like [[wizard]]s or [[cleric]]s.

Another ability gained by artificers from their unique approach to magic was their ability to replenish a magical item's energy without additional materials. Artificers could do this over a short rest by using their body as a channel for arcane energy, with which they then replenished the item. Their ability to do this was directly proportional to their own experience and intelligence.

The spell-like effects that were closest to the artificer's view of magic were collectively called the school of artifice. As these spells were produced in way very different from conventional casting, it was considered a [[school of thaumaturgy]]. It was opposed to the schools of [[necromancy]] and [[enchantment/charm]].

==Artificer Specializations==
Artificers often focused on specific technological pursuits, preferring to work more exclusively in one field or another. Depending on an artificer's specialization they could develop more fantastic inventions of a given type.

===Alchemist===
{{Main|Alchemist}}
These artificers specialized in combining various substances, compounds, and reagents in order to create spectacular effects. It was one of the more adaptable of artificery disciplines as well as the one practiced furthest back in history. An alchemist's concoctions would often grant amazing powers to themselves or their allies, but could also sap the life force away from their opponents.

Novice alchemists regularly achieved some level of proficiency with their [[alchemist's supplies|required supplies]] and learned how to brew ''[[Experimental elixir|experimental elixirs]]''. These draughts granted one of numerous boons to the imbiber and could even heal them of their wounds. Over the course of their career, more experienced alchemists developed more potent version of their ''elixirs'' and learned how to incorporate various restorative techniques to heal and restore their fellows. Master alchemists gained superior understanding of revitalization techniques, and had exposed themselves to so many chemicals, over time developed resistances and immunities to [[acid]]s and [[poison]]s.

===Artillerist===

Some artificers explored more direct methods to solving their problems through invention, by crafting devices that would launch energy projectiles, explosives, and other volatile missiles at others. Their industrious efforts produced spectacular ordnance that were sought out by wagers of war from across the planes.

Artillerists utilized [[woodcarver's tools]] to develop and craft spectacular and volatile weaponry. Novice artillerists first learned how to construct and wield ''[[eldritch cannon]]s'', technological conduits of arcane energy that more–or–less resembled oversized [[firearm]]s. These magic-infused bombards varied in size and form, ranging from hand-held devices the size of a [[pistol]], to cannons the height of a [[goblin]] that had to rest on fabricated legs. In function, ''eldritch cannons'' could be made to spout a cone of flame, discharge bolts of [[force|force energy]], or a blast of rejuvenating [[positive energy]].

Beyond their ''eldritch cannons'', more experienced artillerists developed techniques to repurpose arcane [[implement]]s―that is [[wand]]s, [[rod]]s, and [[staves]]―into magical firearms. By utilizing unique sets of sigils, these 'arcane firearms' would function as an artillerist's [[arcane focus]], bolstering the potency of their chosen spells.

As they continued to hone their craft, skillful artillerists fine-tuned their ''eldritch cannons'' to make them more explosive. Master artillerists learned how to strategically place their cannons behind forms of cover and even operate two cannons simultaneously.

==History==
[[File:Kenku_Artificer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A kenku artificer, crafting some happy little friends.]]
Following the destruction of Lantan during the [[Spellplague]], many of the fallen nation's artificers scattered throughout Faerûn.{{cite dragon/403/Gond's Way: Artificers of the Realms|2-3}}

Many traveled to the [[East Rift]] to explore the ruins that had been unearthed in the wake of the [[Underchasm]]'s creation, becoming engineers for the dwarven city of [[Eartheart]]. Others took to exploring the [[Underdark]] for ancient relics and competing against artificers of factions rival to the Church of Gond.

Others became obsessed with studying the fallen civilization of Lantan and sought to recreate its lost technological wonders. Some were so bold as to aspire to one day defeat the sea monster that guarded its flooded ruins.
