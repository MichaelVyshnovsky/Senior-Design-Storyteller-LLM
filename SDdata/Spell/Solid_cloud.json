        "mainbody": "Solid cloud was an alteration spell, developed by the air elementalist Mortimer Lightfoot in the mid–14 century DR, that allowed a caster to make a single cloud tangible.\nUpon having solid cloud cast on it, a cloud was capable of being walked on and supporting objects as if it were solid ground. When interacted with, a cloud had a cottony and soft touch. This effect was permanent.\nIn addition to requiring somatic and verbal components, solid cloud required a material component, which took the form of the cloud that was to be used by the spell.\nIn the mid–14 century DR, Mortimer Lightfoot and a group of other rogue elementalists known as the Circle of Four used solid cloud, alongside Mortimers other spell cloud shape, to create a sort of cloud palace that they used to imprison their kidnapped victims."
