        "mainbody": "Create or destroy water, also known simply as create water or destroy water, was a transmutation/alteration or conjuration spell that could create a quantity of drinkable water or remove a like quantity of standing water.\nThis spell had two functions with opposite effects.\nCreate water conjured into being a quantity of potable water equivalent to rainwater. The earliest versions of this spell created up to 4 gal (15 L) of pure water per level of the caster within a distance of 10 ft (3 m) to 30 ft (9.1 m) and took one minute to cast.The Players Handbook v.3.5 does not explain how much water a 0th-level caster can create. The rare version used by wizards brought forth 1 gal per level only.The Players Handbook v.3.5 states that water weighs about 8 lb/gal (0.96 kg/L) and that 1 ft3 (28.3 L) of water weighs about 60 lb (27 kg). In 2nd edition, the figures given are 8 lb/gal (1.0 kg/L) and 64 lb (29 kg).\nAll versions of create water could also be cast into an area as rain. The earliest versions could disperse the water as droplets in a 27 ft3 (1 yd3 or 0.76 m3) cube and could extinguish normal fires. The next version worked in a volume three times larger than the volume of the water being summoned. After the Second Sundering, the basic version of this spell produced 10 gal (38 L) of water in a 30 ft (9.1 m) cube. The size of the cube could be increased by 5 ft (1.5 m) in each dimension by allotting additional spell levels.\nthumb|A spell symbol of destroy water.\nDestroy water removed without trace (no fog, mist, steam, or vapor) a similar quantity of water from a nearby pool or receptacle. After the Second Sundering, this version of the spell could be used to remove fog in a cube whose size was determined in the same manner as for create water.\nAll versions of this spell required verbal and somatic components to cast. The material component for create water was a drop of water, except for the cantrip/orison version with did not require any material component. For destroy water, some versions required a pinch of dust while others used sand.\nIt was recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki."
