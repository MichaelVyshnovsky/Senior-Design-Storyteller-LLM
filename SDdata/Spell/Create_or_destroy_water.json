        "Effects": "This spell had two functions with opposite effects.\n\n''Create water'' conjured into being a quantity of potable water equivalent to rainwater. The earliest versions of this spell created up to 4 gal (15 L) of pure water per level of the caster within a distance of 10 ft (3 m) to 30 ft (9.1 m) and took one minute to cast.The [[Player's Handbook v.3.5]] does not explain how much water a 0th-level caster can create. The rare version used by [[wizard]]s brought forth 1 gal per level only.The [[Player's Handbook v.3.5]] states that water weighs about 8 lb/gal (0.96 kg/L) and that 1 ft<sup>3</sup> (28.3 L) of water weighs about 60 lb (27 kg). In [[Player's Handbook 2nd edition|2nd edition]], the figures given are 8{{frac|1|2}} lb/gal (1.0 kg/L) and 64 lb (29 kg).\n\nAll versions of ''create water'' could also be cast into an area as rain. The earliest versions could disperse the water as droplets in a 27 ft<sup>3</sup> (1 yd<sup>3</sup> or 0.76 m<sup>3</sup>) cube and could extinguish normal fires. The next version worked in a volume three times larger than the volume of the water being summoned. After the Second Sundering, the basic version of this spell produced 10 gal (38 L) of water in a 30 ft (9.1 m) cube. The size of the cube could be increased by 5 ft (1.5 m) in each dimension by allotting additional spell levels.\n\n[[File:Destroy Water 5e.png|thumb|''A spell symbol of destroy water.'']]\n''Destroy water'' removed without trace (no fog, mist, steam, or vapor) a similar quantity of water from a nearby pool or receptacle.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"NotIn3\" /> After the Second Sundering, this version of the spell could be used to remove fog in a cube whose size was determined in the same manner as for ''create water''.",
        "Components": "All versions of this spell required verbal and somatic components to cast. The material component for ''create water'' was a drop of water, except for the cantrip/orison version with did not require any material component. For ''destroy water'', some versions required a pinch of dust while others used [[sand]].",
