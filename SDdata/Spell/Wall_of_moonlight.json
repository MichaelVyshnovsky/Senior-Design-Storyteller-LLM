        "mainbody": "Wall of moonlight was a divine alteration or evocation spell that created a curtain of light that harmed evil creatures and highlighted magical items. It was available only to priests of Sel没ne the Moonmaiden.\nAfter the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, the spell was available to clerics of Sel没ne.\nAfter the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, it was available to clerics, druids, and rangers initiated into the greatest secrets of the Sel没nite church.\nAs the name implied, the spell evoked a wall of magical moonlight into existence, appearing like a plane or tapestry of swirling pearly white light. It was some  thick and could be at least  in surface area, more with the casters skill, less if it was limited by the surroundings or the caster designed it with an opening. It did not need to be anchored to anything, but had to stand upright and could not be moved once created. It had a brief duration, and could not be dismissed early.\nAlthough composed of force, the wall of moonlight was intangible anything could contact it or pass through it. However, it had certain effects on creatures and items that did. Undead creatures were seriously damaged, while evil beings and anyone carrying a holy symbol of Shar or Umberlee were harmed to a lesser degree. Magical items spontaneous glowed red as if with faerie fire for a brief period this could not be removed before it expired. Magical potions could even explode if in glass, crystal, or ceramic flasks, they might injure people nearby. If the wall of moonlight appeared where creatures already stood, they would be affected as if theyd passed through. If they had to pass through multiple times, or halted within it for too long, they could be affected each time.\nThe shimmering, false moonlight was sufficiently bright for reading and illuminating an area up to  from it, and dimly beyond that. It could counter darkness or any similar spell of up to the same level that appeared within  of it. Those with infravision could not see through it clearly, though they might shield their eyes from the glare.\nThe wall of moonlight could be made permanent with a permanency spell by a sufficiently experienced caster.\nBoth verbal and somatic components were required.\nWalls of moonlight were used for defense and construction at the House of the Moon temple in Waterdeep. They would appear in an instant if someone tried to fly in and land on the Grand Balcony and the Dome of the Moon was made of multiple wall of moonlight spells, overlapped and combined with a number of carefully worded wish spells. While normally any matter could pass through, the high priestess and the goddess could both will it to become an impenetrable wall of force or make it disappear completely. Moreover, inside the temple, any Sel没nite priest of sufficient rank could freely conjure a wall of moonlight among other spells."
