Avoidance was an arcane abjuration and alteration spell that created a strong repulsion between the target and all other living things besides the caster.
This spell could only be used upon inanimate objects. Creatures attempting to touch the object found themselves halting before being able to do so. The magic of the spell would even violently throw creatures approaching too quickly.
The reverse of this spell, attraction, had the opposite effect, drawing creatures toward it.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a magnetized needle to cast.
Rial Potjian, a guildmaster in Ravens Bluff during the 14 century DR, memorized the avoidance spell.
