        "mainbody": "Laerals crowning touch was an incredibly powerful spell used by the Chosen of Mystra.\nA caster used this spell to place a powerful long-term curse onto a targeted creature. For the curse to be placed successfully, the targeted creature had to be a spellcaster. The symbol of Mystra was branded on each palm of the target, only the target was able to see the brand without magical aid, such as with a detect magic spell. This silver brand remained even after the curse expired. A silver streak also appeared in their hair.\nWhile cursed, whenever the target cast a spell, their powers were diminished according to the strength of that spell casting two of their strongest spells was enough for most wizards to lose all their powers, and even one or two of the least spells was enough to take away all of an affected mages most powerful spells. Spells that were memorized when the curse was placed were not lost, but the target was unable to memorize any further spells until the curse expired. Additionally, each time they cast a spell, a new streak of silver appeared in their hair. Once their hair was completely silver, it withered and fell from their scalp. Other physical changes manifested as well, such as their vocal cords becoming covered in sores and their hands becoming arthritics and useless. These changes make it difficult to cast even the most basic spell.\nThe duration of the curse was quite long, at a year plus a day. During this time, the target was aware of the curse. Once the curse expired, the physical changes reverted. Although their spell casting abilities returned to normal, the caster was not returned to their previous skill level.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components.\nThis spell was so powerful and difficult to cast that only the Chosen of Mystra were able to cast it. Of them, only The Simbul, Alustriel Silverhand and Laeral Silverhand had learned how to cast this spell."
