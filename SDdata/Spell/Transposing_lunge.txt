'''''Transposing lunge''''' is a [[spell]] used by several [[swordmage]]s, particularly those of the [[Swordmage#Shielding Swordmage|shielding]] style. When ''transposing lunge'' is cast it allows a swordmage to [[teleportation|teleport]] a creature struck their weapon in melee combat to a nearby location. Shielding swordmages have the added capacity to teleport in such a way creatures who would normally beyond the reach of the spell, so long as they are also currently under the affect of the ''[[aegis of shielding]]'' spell. ''Transposing lunge'' can be recharged after a short rest of a few minutes, at which point it can be cast again.
