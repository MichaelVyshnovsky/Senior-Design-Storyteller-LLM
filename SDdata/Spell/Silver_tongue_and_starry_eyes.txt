Silver tongue and starry eyes was a powerful divine alteration spell used by specialty priests devoted to Lurue called Silvermaids.
Targeted only on creatures with basic animal intelligence, priestesses used this spell to convert a potential follower to Lurue. The animal target received a permanent boost to its intelligence and was then able to speak to humans and demihumans. There was a small chance that the animal would pass its acquired intelligence on to its offspring for future generations.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priestesss holy symbol and a vial of water collected from the River Rauvin at Silverymoon Ford to cast.
