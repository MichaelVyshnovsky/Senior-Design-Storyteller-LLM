'''''Silver tongue and starry eyes''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Lurue]] called [[Silvermaid]]s.

==Effects==
Targeted only on creatures with basic animal intelligence, priestesses used this spell to convert a potential follower to Lurue. The animal target received a permanent boost to its intelligence and was then able to speak to [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s. There was a small chance that the animal would pass its acquired intelligence on to its offspring for future generations.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priestess's [[holy symbol]] and a vial of water collected from the [[River Rauvin]] at [[Silverymoon Ford]] to cast.
