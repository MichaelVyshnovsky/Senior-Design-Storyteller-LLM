Nahals reckless dweomer was an arcane spell that used wild magic on a most basic level. To Zakharan mages, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as reckless dweomer.
The caster invoked a surge of magical energy in order to create the effect of any one spell known to him. Often however, the release of energy created a completely unpredictable result. Thus this simple spell, which only required verbal and somatic components, carried both great potential and great risk, and therefore was usually used when no other route was open to the caster.
As a wild magic spell, Nahals reckless dweomer was usable only by wild mages. Among those it was considered a common spell.
