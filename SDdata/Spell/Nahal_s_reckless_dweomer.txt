'''''Nahal's reckless dweomer''''' was an [[arcane spell]] that used [[wild magic]] on a most basic level. To [[Zakhara]]n mages, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''reckless dweomer'''''.

==Effects==
The caster [[Evocation|invoked]] a [[Wild surge|surge of magical energy]] in order to create the effect of any one spell known to him. Often however, the release of energy created a completely unpredictable result. Thus this simple spell, which only required [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, carried both great potential and great risk, and therefore was usually used when no other route was open to the caster.

==Users==
As a wild magic spell, ''Nahal's reckless dweomer'' was usable only by [[wild mage]]s. Among those it was considered a common spell.
