        "mainbody": "Cut was a useful cantrip that neophyte wizards could learn. It sliced relatively thin or soft material with a quick gesture.\nThis spell only worked on non-living, non-magical materials that were thin and relatively susceptible to cutting, such as rope, cord, twine, sausage, cloth, parchment, a wax candle, a slender wire, or a delicate chain. The target of this spell had to be in sight and within  of the caster. For severing objects such as rope, the object could not be more than  thick. For cutting objects like cloth, a slice up to  long could be made.The Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four reduced the range and limited the thickness of what could be cut with this spell. When cast, this spell gave off a small cloud of harmless blue sparks.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components. The caster gestured with two adjacent fingers of one hand in a scissor motion while softly making a sound of a cut, like \"snikt\".\nThe description of this cantrip was recorded in the infamous spellbook known as The Alcaister, along with two others.The three cantrips described in Dragon #100 were replaced with the cantrip spell when the 2-edition Pages from the Mages was published. The Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four describes all the 1-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with cantrip."
