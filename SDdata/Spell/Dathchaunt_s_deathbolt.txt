Dathchaunts deathbolt was the first combination spell. It was developed by Dathchaunt Sandrach.
The spell was identical to fireball, but the area was then struck through by lightning, as if from a lightning bolt however, the strength of the lightning was only slightly over half of the flames.
Besides verbal and somatic components, the spell called for a pinch or more of  saltpeter or phosphorus, a small, smoothed piece of amber, and ash from a tree scorched by lightning.
This was the first of the combination spells. It was created by the Magister Dathchaunt Sandrach.
