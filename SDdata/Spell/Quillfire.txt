Quillfire was a spell used by druids.
When cast, the casters hand became covered in quills that contained poison. The caster was able to use these quills in either melee or ranged combat against an opponent. The amount of damage the poison inflicted was determined by the casters skill level.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
