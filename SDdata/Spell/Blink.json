        "mainbody": "Blink was a transmutation spell caused the caster to \"blink\" randomly between the Prime Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, similar to a blink dog.\nThis made the caster harder to attack, since there was a chance an attack or spell would miss due to the caster not being on the Prime Material Plane at the time.\nThe caster could attempt to move through solid objects on the Prime Material Plane while blinked onto the Ethereal Plane, however, if the caster materialized in the same location as a solid object, he or she became \"shunted\" to the nearest available empty space, and this caused damage.\nThe later post-Sundering version of the spell worked much in the same way but it allowed movement of only 10 feet. The caster could see and hear into the prime to a distance of only 60 feet but in shades of gray. While on the ethereal plane, the caster could not interact with creatures on the prime, only with those that connected to the ethereal plane. If no unoccupied space was found within 10 feet when the caster had to return, they would be randomly be placed in the nearest unoccupied area.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were needed for the casting.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Oberon in  and was originally called Oberons blinking.\nDuring the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, Luna confronted the false avatar of Sel√ªne, but she cast sink and caused her to fall into the ground. Luna used a blink spell to escape.\nThe fang dragon Nartheling, the \"Master of the Mountain\", could cast blink."
