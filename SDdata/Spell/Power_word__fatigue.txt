'''''Power word, fatigue''''', was a [[spell]] from the [[enchantment]] school that could be wielded by both [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
After the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the spell was able to make one target fatigued. If the target was already fatigued it would become exhausted. The length of the effect was dependent on the target creature's health.

The spell only worked on creatures, under a certain average degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the [[Arcane magic|spellcaster]].

==Components==
The spell required only a [[verbal component]], which was the uttering of the power word itself.

==Usage==
The spell could be learned and cast by both [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.
