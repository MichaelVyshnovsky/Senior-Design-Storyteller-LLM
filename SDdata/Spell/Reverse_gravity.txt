Reverse gravity was a transmutation spell that reversed the direction of gravity in a limited volume of space.
The caster determined a point within a range of 100 ft (30.5 m). The point defined the center of a cylinder with a radius of 50 ft (15.2 m) and a height of 100 ft (30.5 m) within which gravity reversed direction for as long as the caster kept concentrating, up to 1 minute.
Creatures caught on it had to hold on to fixed objects or fall upwards. If no ceiling existed before or at the top of the cylinder, anything that fell upwards would remain floating there until the spell ended.
The spell required verbal, somatic and material components. The materials required were a lodestone and iron filings.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Jeriah Chronos, also known as Chronomancer, in  and was originally known as Chronomancers gravity reversal.
