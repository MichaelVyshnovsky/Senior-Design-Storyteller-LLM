'''''Sprite venom''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell granted to priests of [[Erevan Ilesere]], the Trickster. It created a substance that could be applied to the tips of [[arrow]]s and other piercing weapons.

==Effects==
Casting this spell created an ointment similar to the substance that [[Sprite (creature)|sprites]] used on their arrows. One cast of ''sprite venom'' produced enough [[poison]] to treat the tips of five arrows (more for more experienced casters). A creature struck by a piercing weapon treated with this substance had one chance to resist the magic of the spell and also a chance to resist the poison itself. Failing this, the creature fell into a deep sleep for ten minutes to a full hour. Blunt and bludgeoning weapons gained no benefit from being treated with this substance.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s in the form of the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a pinch of [[sand]] from a [[sandman]].
