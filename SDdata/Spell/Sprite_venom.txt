Sprite venom was a divine magic spell granted to priests of Erevan Ilesere, the Trickster. It created a substance that could be applied to the tips of arrows and other piercing weapons.
Casting this spell created an ointment similar to the substance that sprites used on their arrows. One cast of sprite venom produced enough poison to treat the tips of five arrows (more for more experienced casters). A creature struck by a piercing weapon treated with this substance had one chance to resist the magic of the spell and also a chance to resist the poison itself. Failing this, the creature fell into a deep sleep for ten minutes to a full hour. Blunt and bludgeoning weapons gained no benefit from being treated with this substance.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components in the form of the priests holy symbol and a pinch of sand from a sandman.
