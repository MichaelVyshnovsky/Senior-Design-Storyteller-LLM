Determine final rest was a divine divination spell used by specialty priests devoted to Jergal called Doomscribes.
This spell was used to reveal the aura of a living or dead creature and which outer plane, and specific level within that plane, their soul should be assigned. Spells that prevented a know alignment spell from working affected this spell in the same way.
This spell required only  verbal and somatic components to cast.
