        "mainbody": "'''''Venomous blade''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Selvetarm]].",
        "Effects": "This spell temporarily envenomed a single-bladed melee weapon. The weapon delivered venom with the first three strikes into a target. The wielder had to use the weapon within a day or else the effects of the spell expired. Like a ''[[sword of wounding]]'', wounds caused by this spell could not be magically healed. Only a ''[[wish]]'' spell could heal injuries from this spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, a thick paste made from venom and other noxious ingredients that was rubbed onto the blade."
