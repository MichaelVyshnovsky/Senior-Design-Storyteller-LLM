        "mainbody": "'''''Earthbind''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that temporarily suppressed a creature's ability to fly.",
        "Effects": "The spell enveloped a creature within a range of {{SI|300|ft|long=yes}} in yellow strips of magical energy. If unable to resist, the affected creature could not fly again for up to 1 minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating.\n\nIf ''earthbind'' was cast on an airborne creature, it gently descended to the ground as if under the effect of a ''[[feather fall]]'' spell. Even if a newly applied effect would grant the creature the ability to fly again, it would be suppressed for the duration of the ''earthbind'' spell.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[verbal component]]s, though some older versions of it required a [[somatic component]].",
        "Notable Users": "* [[Gadacro]] had an innate ability to cast this spell once per day."
