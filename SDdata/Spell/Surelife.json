        "mainbody": "Surelife was a rare divine abjuration spell unique to those who worshiped deities with the Repose domain a common arcane alteration spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur.\nSurelife protected the caster from a deadly condition. Conditions varied but included being immersed in boiling oil, buried in an avalanche, etc. This spell only offered protection against natural conditions or occurrences. No protection was gained against conditions created by monsters or spells that mimicked natural conditions.\nThe caster specified the condition from which they needed protection, and the spell would only protect against that condition. In the caster suffered the specified condition while the spell was in effect, they were not discomforted or harmed. However,  items carried by the caster did not enjoy the same protection. When the spell expired, the chosen condition, if it was still presented, affected the caster in the full and normal way.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components, and a material component in the form of an ointment of peach syrup and cinnabar to cast."
