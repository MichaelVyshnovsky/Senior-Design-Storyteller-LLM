        "mainbody": "'''''Blastcloak''''' was a [[spell]] that was first developed by the [[phaerimm]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell was identical to ''[[backblast]]'' but more powerful. When cast, this spell surrounded the caster or target creature with an invisible aura. If the individual was targeted by a fire-based spell, that spell was automatically thrown back to the source. Distance was not a limiting factor with this spell, so if the targeted creature was struck by a time-delayed fire-based spell, such as ''[[delayed blast fireball]]'', the fireball was sent back to the person who cast it, even if they had left the area. ''[[Dispel magic]]'' was able to cancel this spell. This spell only protected a single creature at a time.",
        "Components": "This spell required only a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component.",
        "History": "This spell was originally created by the phaerimms of [[Myth Drannor]]."
