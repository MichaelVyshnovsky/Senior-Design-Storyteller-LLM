Melt was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur.
When cast, the spell raised the temperature of a small area,  around the wu jen. Creatures from the Para-Elemental Plane of Ice or from colder climates were vulnerable to this spell. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a pinch of soot and rock salt.
