        "mainbody": "'''''Spellslayer arrow''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that altered an [[arrow]] of ''masterwork'' quality, bestowing upon it extra lethality to those who were affected by [[magic]]al effects or abilities.",
        "Effects": "The enhanced arrow became more harmful to people and creatures that had been [[enchantment|enchanted]], protected or otherwise affected by magical spells.\n\nIn order for the effects of the spell to apply, the arrow had to be launched within a few seconds of ''spellslayer arrow's'' casting. The arrow itself was destroyed whether or not it struck its intended target.",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the [[material component]] of a single ''masterwork'' arrow."
