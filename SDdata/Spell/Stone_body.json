        "mainbody": "Stone body was a spell similar to the iron body spell.\nWhen cast, the casters body was transformed into living stone. Their strength and weight increased dramatically. The spell reduced the casters speed and they became vulnerable to effects or spells that were designed to target stone golems.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small stone. This stone could come from a castle wall, or as a piece from either a greater earth elemental or stone golem."
