        "mainbody": "Time loop was an arcane magic spell of the southern magic tradition.\nThe spell created a 20-ft (6.1-m) cube in which the flow of time repeated itself until the spell expired. Anyone caught in the spell perceived the flow of time outside the cube as random and chaotic. Outside the cube, they appeared to be repeating the same set of actions over and over. Creatures and objects inside the time loop could be affected by ranged weapons and attacks, but the spell trapped anyone who physically entered the affected area.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a mixture of several expensive crushed gems, at 100 gp each. These ingredients were the dust of a diamond, an emerald, a ruby and a sapphire."
