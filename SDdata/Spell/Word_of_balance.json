        "mainbody": "Word of balance was an evocation spell that adversely affected creatures who held both extreme views on ethics and morals.\nWord of balance affected creatures who held extreme views on both ethics and morals, meaning chaotic evil, chaotic good, lawful evil, and lawful good ones, within 30 feet (9 meters) within the caster. The second criteria was the affected creatures strength in relation to the caster. When the affected creatures were about as strong as the caster, they were physically sickened to a degree that made it hard for them to act. Creatures who were slightly weaker than the caster were both sickened in the aforementioned way and the spell additionally sapped their physical strength. Creatures that were meaningfully weaker than the caster suffered both effects, but were also paralyzed. Creatures that were even weaker than that simply died.\nIf an elemental or outsider was affected by word of balance cast by caster who was on his or her native plane of existence, the creature was not only sent back to wherever it came from, but was also incapable to re-enter the foreign plane for 24 hours.\nWord of balance required only verbal components."
