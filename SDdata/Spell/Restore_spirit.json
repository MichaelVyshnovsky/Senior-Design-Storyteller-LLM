        "mainbody": "Restore spirit was a powerful spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWith this spell, a shugenja was able to return a wandering or lost spirit to its body. During casting, the shugenja placed their hands on the body. If the spell was successful, the spirit returned instantly to its body. Shugenja were often asked by wu jen to cast this spell to correct mishaps from certain spells involving the spirit leaving the body such as spirit self.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a red robe."
