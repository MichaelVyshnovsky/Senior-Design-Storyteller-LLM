Major image, also known as spectral force or, originally, Carburys spectral force,
This spell allowed the caster to create an illusion that included sound, visual imagery, smell, and even temperature. The spectral image could be positioned at a great distance from the caster, and it could occupy a volume of 9,000 cubic feet or greater, depending on the power of the spellcaster.
The caster could control its movement by concentrating, and the illusion would remain for a short time after the caster ceased concentrating. If an opponent attacked the illusion, it would fade away, unless the caster were able to make the figment respond believably.
Verbal and somatic components and a bit of fleece as a spell focus were required to cast this spell.
The spell was invented by the Netherese arcanist Carbury in , the same year in which he also created his mouth spell.
