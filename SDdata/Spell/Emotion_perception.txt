Emotion perception was a divine divination spell from the war sphere that allowed the caster to get a sense of the emotional state and morale of a military unit.
In order for the spell to function the caster needed to have an uninterrupted line of sight to the military unit.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the priests holy symbol to cast.
Watcher Tonorak Winthrax, a priest of Helm, could cast emotion perception.
