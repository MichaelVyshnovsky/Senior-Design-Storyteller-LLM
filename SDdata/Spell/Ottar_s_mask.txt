Ottars mask was an alteration wizard spell.
This spell allowed either the caster or a target they touched to assume the visage and appearance of any other being visible to the caster when the spell was cast. The appearance was a perfect replica, including by scent and texture, from the front only. The disguise was even undetectable from magical prying.
Natural abilities, such as infravision, of the host subject were even transferred to the target of the spell. Magical or spell-like abilities were not transferred nor were physical attributes like strength and dexterity.
Ottars mask even transferred species-specific immunities or weaknesses to poison and disease. The target of the spell could cancel the disguise at any time before the spell expired.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a piece of skin and eyelash from a living creature to cast.
Only a few Harper agents and the women of the Seven Sisters were known to use this spell. It was rumored that some witches of Rashemen had access to this magic as well.
