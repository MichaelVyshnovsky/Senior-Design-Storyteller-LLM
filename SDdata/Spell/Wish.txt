Wish was arguably the most powerful spell that a sorcerer or wizard could hope to learn.  
When cast, it allowed its caster to accomplish multiple, various effects ranging from duplicating other spell effects to altering reality to suit the casters wish.
The spell required only a verbal component to cast.
The wish spell was not crafted until a hundred years after the Fall of Netheril.
