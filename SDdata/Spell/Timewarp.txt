Timewarp was a powerful southern magic divine spell available to worshipers of Thoth.
When cast, this spell allowed the caster to send a single creature up to two minutes in past. The spell took a physical toll on the caster, aging their body by a full year.
In addition to somatic and verbal components, this spell required a material component in the form of sand.
