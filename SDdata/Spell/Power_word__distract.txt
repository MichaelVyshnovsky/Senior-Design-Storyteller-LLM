'''''Power word, distract''''', was a [[spell]] from the [[enchantment]] school that could be wielded by both [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
After the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the spell was able to briefly distract a creature. The distraction was great enough that it heavily hampered the target's ability to defend itself.

The spell only worked on creatures under a certain high degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the [[Arcane magic|spellcaster]].

==Components==
The spell required only a [[verbal component]], which was the uttering of the power word itself.
==Usage==
The spell could be wielded by both [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.
