'''''Tenser's floating disk''''', also written as '''''Tenser's floating disc''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a floating disk.

To [[Zakhara]]n mages, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''floating disc''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].

==Effects==
On casting ''Tenser's floating disk'', a slightly concave circular disk made of force appeared floating about {{SI|3|feet|c|long=yes}} above the ground. Its carrying capacity increased with the caster's skill where weight was concerned; its carrying capacity regarding liquids stayed static at {{SI|2|gallons|long=yes}}(7.6 litres). By default, the disk followed behind the caster at a distance of about {{SI|5|feet|c|long}}, but it could be ordered to float to anywhere. The disk and the caster needed to be within a certain distance that grew with the caster's skill; otherwise, the disk simply disappeared and the contents fell on the ground.

==Components==
Casting ''Tenser's floating disk'' required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s. The last was a drop of [[mercury]].

==History==
The twin brothers [[Tarik al Farid al Fuqani|Tarik]] and [[Chaid al Farid al Fuqani]], young apprentices at [[Blackstaff Tower]], used ''floating disks'' to destroy an invading [[nishruu]] on [[Uktar 28]] of {{Yearlink|1374}} by dumping salt upon the creature.
