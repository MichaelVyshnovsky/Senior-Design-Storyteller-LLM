Wizard sight was a type of spell that enchanted its casters eyesight.
This spell caused a wizards eye to glow blue and allowed them to see the magical aura of magical items and the auras of other spellcasters that were normally visible to them. These auras varied in intensity and the caster could try to guess how powerful an individual or an objects enchantment were based on them.
In the case of individuals, wizard sight allowed its caster to determine what kind of spellcaster an individual was and what (if any) kind of specialty they were. In addition, the caster was able to sense whether individuals held a potential for learning and casting spells.
Wizard sight did not grant its caster the ability to see the aura of things that were invisible to them, it did not reveal alignment, and the effects of magical items could not be discerned by it. This also meant that the spell could not be used to determine whether or not an object was cursed. The only thing that could be determined by the spell was what type of magic an object contained.
Casting wizard sight required both a somatic and verbal component.
In the 14 century DR, the Diviners Guild of Ravens Bluff actively sold scrolls containing wizard sight for around 2,400 gp.
