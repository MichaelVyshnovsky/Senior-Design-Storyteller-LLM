        "mainbody": "Brilliant censure was a powerful daily prayer available to clerics during the post-Spellplague era.\nWhen brilliant censure was cast, a zone of bright light would be created, centered around the caster and would move with them. This zone of light was blinding to those considered enemies to the caster and would temporarily imbue radiant energy into any attacks made by the casters allies within range.\nCasting this prayer required an implement of some kind, likely taking the form of the clerics holy symbol.\nIn the , a party of four Daggerdalesmen adventurers were summoned to the mines of Tethyamar by the Banite priestess Lorin-Aria to kill the Zhent wizard Rezlus and put an end to his plans to conquer Daggerdale and the greater Dalelands region. Among this party of adventurers was a dwarf cleric who knew the prayer brilliant censure."
