        "mainbody": "'''''Brilliant censure''''' was a powerful daily prayer available to [[cleric]]s during the post-[[Spellplague]] era.",
        "Effects": "When ''brilliant censure'' was cast, a zone of bright light would be created, centered around the caster and would move with them. This zone of light was blinding to those considered enemies to the caster and would temporarily imbue [[radiant energy]] into any attacks made by the caster's allies within range.",
        "Components": "Casting this prayer required an [[implement]] of some kind, likely taking the form of the cleric's [[holy symbol]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1420}}, a party of four [[Daggerdale]]smen [[adventurer]]s were [[teleport|summoned]] to the [[mines of Tethyamar]] by the [[Banite]] priestess [[Lorin-Aria]] to kill the [[Zhent]] wizard [[Rezlus]] and put an end to his plans to conquer Daggerdale and the greater [[Dalelands]] region. Among this party of adventurers was a [[dwarf]] [[cleric]] who knew the prayer ''brilliant censure''."
