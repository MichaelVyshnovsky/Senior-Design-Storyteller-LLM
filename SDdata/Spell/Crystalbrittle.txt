Crystalbrittle was an alteration spell that turned any kind of metal into a brittle, crystalline substance.
By touching a single object or creature made of metal, such as a weapon, armor, an item, or even an iron golem, the caster turned a large volume of it into a fragile crystal. The volume affected increased as the caster became more powerful. Magic items and creatures made of metal had a chance of resisting the effect, whereas artifacts were unlikely to be vulnerable at all.
The effects of the spell were permanent and irreversible, short of a wish spell. Not even dispel magic could undo the transformation. An object affected by crystalbrittle had to be protected immediately, since any hit, no matter how feeble, could completely shatter it.
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
The spell was attributed to the Netherese arcanist Ptack in the , and was originally called Ptacks brittleness.
