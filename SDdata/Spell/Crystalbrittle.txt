'''''Crystalbrittle''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that turned any kind of metal into a brittle, crystalline substance.

==Effects==
By touching a single object or creature made of metal, such as a [[weapon]], [[armor]], an item, or even an [[iron golem]], the caster turned a large volume of it into a fragile crystal. The volume affected increased as the caster became more powerful. [[Magic item]]s and creatures made of metal had a chance of resisting the effect, whereas [[artifact]]s were unlikely to be vulnerable at all.

The effects of the spell were permanent and irreversible, short of a ''[[wish]]'' spell. Not even ''[[dispel magic]]'' could undo the transformation. An object affected by ''crystalbrittle'' had to be protected immediately, since any hit, no matter how feeble, could completely shatter it.

==Components==
The spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.

==History==
The spell was attributed to the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Ptack]] in the {{YearlinkName|-503}}, and was originally called ''Ptack's brittleness''.
