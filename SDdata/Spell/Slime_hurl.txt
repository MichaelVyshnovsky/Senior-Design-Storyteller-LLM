Smile hurl was a conjuration spell that created three globs of dark, green slime within the hands of the caster which were subsequently launched towards one or a number of target creatures.
When the globe of slime struck a person or creature it could not be readily removed and had to be destroyed in a specific manner.
The casting of this spell required verbal and somatic components as well as the use of a divine focus.
Slime hurl was only available to initiates of the drow deity of slimes and oozes, Ghaunadaur,
