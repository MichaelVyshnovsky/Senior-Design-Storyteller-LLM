The '''Tablets of Fate''' were powerful [[artifact]]s in the form of stone slabs that served to maintain the balance between the forces of Law and Chaos, and acted as a barrier between the worlds of [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]]. The Tablets also had the additional function of recording the names and purposes of every [[deity|god]] and [[primordial]] in the universe.{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|9}}{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAoq-vwWHHg|title=What is the Sundering?

==Description==
The Tablets were described as plain clay tablets, less than 2 feet high, with the names and portfolios of every deity inscribed in glowing blue-white runes.<ref>

Although [[Bane]] and [[Myrkul]] believed some of [[Ao]]'s power lay in the tablets

==History==
[[File:Ao and Tablets of Fate.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Khelben]] telling [[Kyriani]] of Lord Ao and the Tablets of Fate.'']]
The Tablets of Fate were created by Ao after the [[Tearfall]] and the sundering of [[Abeir-Toril]] as a way to keep the new worlds of Abeir and Toril apart, and to ensure a balance between the forces of Law and Chaos as well as between the gods and the primordials.

In the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], Bane and Myrkul stole the Tablets from Ao and hid them in [[Faer√ªn]] wrongly suspecting that some of the Overgod's power was derived from these tablets. When Ao discovered the Tablets of Fate were missing, he summoned all the deities and asked for those guilty to hand them over. When no one came forward to admit to stealing the Tablets, Ao cast down all the gods from the heavens, taking their divine power in the process. Ao tasked [[Helm]] with guarding the [[Celestial Stairway]]s which would lead the deities back into their divine realms. For this he retained his divine powers.<ref> Before the [[Avatar Crisis]] ended, Bane and Myrkul were both slain

After valiant heroes (among them the mortals [[Cyric]], [[Kelemvor]], and [[Mystra (Midnight)|Midnight]]) recovered the Tablets and returned them to Ao the Overgod himself destroyed the tablets, grinding them into powder. This act, however, unraveled the laws of [[Realmspace]] and began the chaotic period of time known as the [[Era of Upheaval]].

During the [[Second Sundering]] Ao recreated and rewrote the Tablets of Fate, inscribing the names and purposes of the gods and primordials he chose to serve in a new inclusive divine reality.
