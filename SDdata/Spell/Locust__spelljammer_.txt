A '''locust''' was a small and fast spaceship created and employed by the spacefaring inhabitants of [[Wa]] as a short-range support vessel of the larger [[Tsunami (spelljammer)|tsunami]] [[spelljammer]]s.

==Description==
Locusts were made of [[balsa]] wood and were shaped like [[locust]]s. Because of their small size and weight, they were extremely fast and maneuverable, but also extremely fragile.

Due to their diminutive size and frailty, locusts could not be equipped with [[spelljamming helm]]s. Instead, their propulsion system was a ''[[rudder of propulsion]]'', a [[magic item]] developed by a [[wu jen]] in collaboration with a [[wizard]] from [[Cormyr]].

Locusts were typically employed in attack maneuvers, deployed from a [[Tsunami (spelljammer)|tsunami]] to weaken or destroy a target while the larger ship stayed behind. They would either attack with a single built-in weapon or would simply ram into their targets, triggering a large explosion of their reservoir of [[Greek fire]].

==History==
In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], locusts were primarily built in the [[Iiso]] spelljamming port.
