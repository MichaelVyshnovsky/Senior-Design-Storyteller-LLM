'''''Swirling scythes''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[invocation]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Osiris]] called [[Divine Arbitrator]]s.

==Effects==
This spell surrounded the caster with a ring of invisible whirling [[scythe]]s made from force. The caster chose the height at which the scythes whirled around them and could change the height at will provided it was not higher than their head or lower than their feet. The scythes moved with the caster, ignoring all hard surfaces but causing great harm to living creatures and organic matter. The caster needed to maintain concentration or the spell would end prematurely.

''Swirling scythes'' was originally used in [[Mulhorand]] to harvest fields, but proved to be quite effective in combat as well.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] priest's [[holy symbol]] and a miniature [[silver]] or [[gold]] scyth to cast.
