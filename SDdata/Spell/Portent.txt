Portent was a divine divination spell from the chaos and divination spheres that provided the caster with a glimpse of their luck in the future.
This spell gave the caster a glimpse of their luck in the near future for either themselves or another subject. The glimpse provided a brief insight into an event that would occur within one full day of the spells casting, informing the subject on whether the outcome would be favorable or undesirable.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components either some tea leaves or a numbered wheel to cast.
Bando the Lame, a halfling cleric of Tymora living in Daggerford, could cast portent.
