Stone seeing was a spell used by clerics of Dumathoin.
This spell allowed the caster to scry a target from a distance. Unlike clairvoyance and wizard eye, the targeted location had to be encased within stone, such as a cavern or under a structure. The spell had a minimum range of , which increased depending on the casters skill level. The spell allowed the caster to detect veins and imperfections in rock, as well as detect creatures such as xorn.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Dumathoin and a small piece of stone of the same type that was to be scried through.
