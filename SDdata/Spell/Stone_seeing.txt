'''''Stone seeing''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Dumathoin]].

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to scry a target from a distance. Unlike [[clairvoyance]] and [[wizard eye]], the targeted location had to be encased within stone, such as a cavern or under a structure. The spell had a minimum range of {{SI|100|yd|long=yess}}, which increased depending on the caster's skill level. The spell allowed the caster to detect veins and imperfections in rock, as well as detect creatures such as [[xorn]].

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Dumathoin and a small piece of stone of the same type that was to be scried through.
