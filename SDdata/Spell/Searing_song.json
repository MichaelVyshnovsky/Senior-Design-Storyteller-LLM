        "mainbody": "'''''Searing song''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Milil]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell released a beam of solid air at a target. This invisible beam of air could pass through all mundane and magical barriers. However, the target had to be visible to the caster for the spell to function properly. The caster could enhance the strength of the spell, so that the beam of air was so strong it could sear the flesh from the bones of the targeted creature.",
        "Components": "This spell required only a [[verbal component]]. The caster sung a verse during casting. If the caster sang the enchanted verse twice through, the more powerful version of this spell was cast.",
        "History": "''Searing song'' was one of the spells found in ''[[Wythyndle's Round Book]]'', one of the few [[holy book]]s of the [[Church of Milil]]."
