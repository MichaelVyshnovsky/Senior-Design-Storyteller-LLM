'''''Blade of doom''''', also known as '''''Shaeroon's scimitar''''', was an [[evocation]] spell that threatened one creature with injury from an invisible sword of force that was triggered by a condition chosen by the caster.

==Effects==
This spell was a curse that followed its target, hovering over the creature's head, waiting to strike if the trigger condition occurred. The sword of force was invisible except to the caster, individuals that could see invisible objects, and to anyone who cast a successful ''[[detect magic]]'' on the unfortunate creature. The trigger condition was usually some action that was undesirable to the caster, such as drawing a weapon or beginning to cast a spell. This spell could last up to one year.

The target did not get a chance to resist ''blade of doom'' until the curse was triggered and the blade struck the target. At that time, if the creature managed to resist the spell, no injury was received. Otherwise, the damage was proportional to the level of the caster. This curse could be removed before the expiration of the spell by the caster or powerful magic such as a ''[[limited wish]]''. A normal ''[[dispel magic]]'' had no affect on this spell. Only one such curse could be put on a single creature at a time.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small model of a [[scimitar]] made from [[rock crystal]] (with a value of 300 gp), [[diamond]] or colorless [[sapphire]] (valued at 3,000 gp).

==Uses==
In practice, this spell was used as a punishment for those who drew the displeasure of a powerful [[wizard]]. It could also be used during negotiations to encourage honesty or discourage treachery.

==History==
This spell first appeared as ''Shaeroon's scimitar'' in the ''[[Book of Bats]]'', which was first recorded as part of the treasure of a [[satrap]] in [[Calimshan]] around [[1147 DR]].

This spell was eventually published in "[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]" and became generally known to the magical community, but remained uncommon around [[1358 DR]].
