        "mainbody": "Teleport fireball was an alteration spell that conjured a fireball, as per the spell of the same name, at a location that could be miles away from the caster.\nWhen this spell was cast, the fireball appeared at a location up 120 miles (193 km) away, as determined by the caster. If the area it was set to appear in was considered to be unsafe, the spell fizzled and had no effect. If it was a relatively safe area, it burst in a 20 (6.1 m) radius explosion.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a pinch of saltpeter, a portion of phosphorous, and a pinch of iron fillings."
