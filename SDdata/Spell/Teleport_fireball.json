        "mainbody": "'''''Teleport fireball''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that conjured a ''[[fireball]]'', as per the spell of the same name, at a location that could be miles away from the caster.",
        "Effects": "When this spell was cast, the ''fireball'' appeared at a location up 120 miles (193 km) away, as determined by the caster. If the area it was set to appear in was considered to be unsafe, the spell fizzled and had no effect. If it was a relatively safe area, it burst in a 20' (6.1 m) radius explosion.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a pinch of [[saltpeter]], a portion of [[phosphorous]], and a pinch of [[iron]] fillings."
