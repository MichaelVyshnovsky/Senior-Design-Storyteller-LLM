Gate of doom was a powerful divine conjuration spell used by specialty priests devoted to Jergal called Doomscribes.
This spell summoned a wall of energy from the Negative Energy plane that also served as a portal to that realm. This shimmering black wall would harm any living creature that touched it and permanently lessen their level of expertise for all of their skills. Any creature passing through the gate of doom would arrive upon the Negative Energy plane and be abandoned as there was no return portal.
Once cast, the gate of doom could not be moved. Nor could it be cast directly on a living creature. Doing so would cause the gate to appear nearby in a random location. The negative plane protection spell prevented a creature from passing through the gate and any harm from befalling a creature if they touched the gate. Undead and creatures tied to the Negative Energy plane ignored this spells effects.
A gate of doom would double the effectiveness of any energy draining undead attacks, the energy drain spell, and enervation spell cast within  of the gate.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a small piece of black charcoal, a black gemstone worth at least 50 gp, and the priests holy symbol to cast.
