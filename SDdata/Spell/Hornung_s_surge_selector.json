        "mainbody": "Hornungs surge selector was a wild magic spell that gave the caster a limited ability to shape wild surges their spells produced, either as a side effect or by way of Nahals reckless dweomer.\nTo Zakharan mages, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as surge selector.\nProper casting of this spell required verbal and somatic components and a brass spinner, which was not consumed during casting.\nAs a wild magic spell, Hornungs surge selector was usable only by wild mages. Among those it was considered a common spell."
