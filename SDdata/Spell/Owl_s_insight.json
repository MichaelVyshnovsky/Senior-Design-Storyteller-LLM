        "mainbody": "'''''Owl's insight''''' was a [[druid]]ic [[spell]], common to powerful druids of the Realms, that granted a subject a taste of the inherent wisdom of nature.",
        "Effects": "Upon casting this spell, the temporary visage of a snow owl covered the druid's face. The caster could lay hands on another and bestow a touch of insight and comprehension, such as commonly held to belong to the [[owl]]. The more powerful the druid, the greater was the increase to the subject's wisdom. The effect lasted for one hour.",
        "Components": "This [[Divine magic|divine]] spell required both [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
