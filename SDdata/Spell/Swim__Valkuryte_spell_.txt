Swim was a divine enchantment spell used by specialty priests devoted to Valkur, allowing untrained swimmers to swim with ease for several hours.
If used on a recipient who did not know how to swim, this spell would grant them the ability to swim. If cast on a proficient swimmer, this spell would allow them to swim with ease. The number of recipients affected by this spell was determined by the casters skill.
In addition to verbal components and somatic components, this spell required as material components a small pumice stone for each recipient to cast.
