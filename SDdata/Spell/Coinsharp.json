        "mainbody": "Coinsharp was a rare arcane alteration spell from the first level of magic that allowed a wizard to transform a coin into a blade and vice versa.\nWith a touch, the spellcaster was able to transform a blade, such as a sword, dagger, scimitar, etc., into a polished golden coin or a golden coin â€“ into a bladed weapon. The blade was always formed to fit perfectly into the casters hand. The transformed weapon or coin appeared perfectly mundane with a slight radiance of transmutation magic. The appearance of the weapon or coin was determined by the wizard, and the caster with especially high intelligence, wit, and concentration could use coinsharp to transform the item into an exact copy of another weapon if able to closely examine the items they were copying immediately before the casting.\nThe transformation lasted for a day at the very basic magical proficiency, and the duration increased with the mages skills. Once the spell expired, the transmuted item returned to its former shape. If the transformed coin or weapon were destroyed or melted or severely damaged in some other way, the spell immediately broke, reverting the transformation.\nCoinsharp required verbal, somatic, and material components to be cast. Is material components were a pinch of iron shavings and a fleck of gold or a gold coin shaving.\nThe coinsharp spell was known to Elminster Aumar of Shadowdale and it was among the spells exchanged between the members of The Wizards Three during their visit to Earth and raiding larders of Ed Greenwood of Canada. The spell was brought over to the world of Oerth by Mordenkainen and lady Rautheene, members of the same de facto group."
