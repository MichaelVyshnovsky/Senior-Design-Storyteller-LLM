        "mainbody": "'''''Coinsharp''''' was a rare [[arcane]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the first level of magic that allowed a [[wizard]] to transform a [[coin]] into a blade and ''vice versa.''",
        "Effects": "With a touch, the spellcaster was able to transform a blade, such as a [[sword]], [[dagger]], [[scimitar]], etc., into a polished [[gold]]en coin or a golden coin â€“ into a bladed [[weapon]]. The blade was always formed to fit perfectly into the caster's hand. The transformed weapon or coin appeared perfectly mundane with a slight radiance of transmutation magic. The appearance of the weapon or coin was determined by the wizard, and the caster with especially high intelligence, wit, and concentration could use ''coinsharp'' to transform the item into an exact copy of another weapon if able to closely examine the items they were copying immediately before the casting.\n\nThe transformation lasted for a day at the very basic magical proficiency, and the duration increased with the mage's skills. Once the spell expired, the transmuted item returned to its former shape. If the transformed coin or weapon were destroyed or melted or severely damaged in some other way, the spell immediately broke, reverting the transformation.",
        "Components": "''Coinsharp'' required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s to be cast. Is material components were a pinch of [[iron]] shavings and a fleck of [[gold]] or a gold coin shaving.",
        "History": "The ''coinsharp'' spell was known to [[Elminster Aumar]] of [[Shadowdale]] and it was among the spells exchanged between the members of [[The Wizards Three]] during their visit to [[Earth]] and raiding larders of [[Ed Greenwood]] of Canada. The spell was brought over to the world of [[Oerth]] by [[Mordenkainen]] and lady [[Rautheene]], members of the same de facto group.{{Cite dragon/242/Jest the Wizards Three|50}}"
