'''''Avasculate''''' was a powerful [[necromantic]] [[spell]] that forced its target to expel blood or other vital bodily fluids.

==Effects==
When the ''avasculate'' spell was cast, a stream of necrotic energy blasted out of the caster's hands towards the target at {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} distance or greater. The stronger the spellcaster was, the further the ''avasculate'' could be flung. When hit with these magics, the target became violently ill, painfully purging blood or other vital fluids out of their body through the skin. Such loss of blood left the target in a tremendously weakened state and stunned for six seconds. Those creatures with impressive fortitude still suffered the blood loss but were not stunned by the pain and gore.

==Components==
The spell called for [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components to be cast.

==History==
Years before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, [[Arduelth]], a young and promising [[Rashemaar]] [[witch]] embarked on her ''dajemma'' and returned home bearing a powerful [[enchanted]] ''[[Periapt of the Lost Witch|periapt]]''. It was one of the several powerful and evil magical items she learned to create. Arduelth wanted to fight [[Thay]]'s evil magics with a similar tool. Despite [[hathran]]s' reluctance, Arduelth was granted the hathran status, only to be executed later when her fellow witches realized the true evil these secret magics brought to Rashemen. Arduelth's ''periapt of the Lost Witch'' possessed several magical properties, including acts to the rare and malicious ''avasculate'' spell.
