'''''Tvash-Prull's bonefiddle''''' was a [[necromantic]] [[bard]] [[spell]] that conjured a ghostly [[fiddle]] bow that played on the bones of a creature, producing a ghostly and painful melody.

==Effects==
When the spell was cast, a spectral bow appeared above the targeted person or creature and immediately dropped down on them, whereupon it started to drag itself back and forth against their bones. As well as causing them injury, pain, and torment that impeded concentration and inhibited spellcasting, it produced an eerie but alluring song. These effects were not stopped if the victim moved away or caster broke line-of-sight, but they could be resisted by those who were particularly resilient. The caster could transfer the fiddle to another creature at will., provided both were in a close range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} or so.

''Bonefiddle'' only affected creatures with a skeletal structure or those with bodies that possessed some form of exoskeleton. 

==Casting==
The casting of this spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in addition to a tiny [[silver]] fiddle worth at least 30 [[gp]] as a [[material component]].
