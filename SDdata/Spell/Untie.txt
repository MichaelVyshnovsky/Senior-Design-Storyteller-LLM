Knot was a reversed cantrip that wizards-in-training could learn. It was the reverse of the tie cantrip and released normal or magical knots.
This cantrip undid the effects of either tie or knot (but not both with one casting) or merely released a normal knot. Untie also canceled a tangle cantrip but left any underlying knots in place. Like its fellow cantrips, untie had no effect on magic items.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast, but the gesture was tuned to the type of action desired. Typically, both hands were placed together and then pulled apart as if untying a knot or breaking a length of string. The verbal component was usually a popping noise.
