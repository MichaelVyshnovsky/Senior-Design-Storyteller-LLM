'''''Puffball''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[plant sphere]] that transformed a common [[mushroom]] into a [[magic]]al puffball.

==Effects==
A ''puffball'' could be thrown or simply dropped in place, bursting to release a cloud of spores covering an area {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. Anyone within the spore cloud was wracked with coughing and choking for several minutes, preventing them from attacking or defending themselves. The spore cloud dissipated after several minutes.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a pinch of ground puffball to cast.

==History==
[[Priest]]s of [[Moander]] learned the ''puffball'' spell early in their training.
