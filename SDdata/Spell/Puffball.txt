Puffball was a divine alteration spell from the plant sphere that transformed a common mushroom into a magical puffball.
A puffball could be thrown or simply dropped in place, bursting to release a cloud of spores covering an area  in diameter. Anyone within the spore cloud was wracked with coughing and choking for several minutes, preventing them from attacking or defending themselves. The spore cloud dissipated after several minutes.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a pinch of ground puffball to cast.
Priests of Moander learned the puffball spell early in their training.
