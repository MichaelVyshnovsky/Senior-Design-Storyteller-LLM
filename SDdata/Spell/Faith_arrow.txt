'''''Faith arrow''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[elf|elven]] [[cleric]]s, primarily the clergy of [[Corellon Larethian]], [[Rillifane Rallathil]], [[Solonor Thelandira]].
 
==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to enchant several mundane [[arrow]]s, imbuing them with divine power. The amount of arrows that could be enchanted was determined by the caster's skill level, up to six arrows. The spell had no effect on magical arrows. As long as the target was within range and sight, the enchanted arrows never missed. The arrows could not penetrate material that stopped a mundane arrow, but could follow a target. When the arrow struck its target, it delivered devastating damage. If the arrows passed through a [[dead-magic zone]] or an [[anti-magic shell]], it lost its enchantment. Once enchanted, an arrows remained enchanted until it was used, afterwards it turned to dust.
 
==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the [[holy symbol]] of the caster and the arrows. The arrows had to have been crafted by an expert fletcher.
