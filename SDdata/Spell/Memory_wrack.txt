Memory wrack was a wicked divine spell from the thought sphere that affected a targets ability to retain information.
This spell temporarily disconnected the target from their short term and long term memory, preventing them from remembering any information for its duration. The spell did not affect memories that occurred before the spell was cast, but any events occurring after the casting were forgotten by the target within seconds.
Memory wrack also prevented the target from formulating any complex plans, limiting them to simple solitary actions. However, any break in the targets concentration would cause them to forget what they were doing or attempting to do. Once the spell expired, the target had no recollection of anything that transpired while the spell was active.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a ruby worth at least 200 gp to cast. The ruby was crushed during the casting.
Sensates, who were specialty priests devoted to Sharess, used the memory wrack spell.
