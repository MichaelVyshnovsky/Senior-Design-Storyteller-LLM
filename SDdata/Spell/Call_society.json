        "mainbody": "Call society was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nWith this spell members of sorcerous societies could call upon other members for assistance. The caster determined the direction the spell would travel to contact another member of the society to which they belonged. The spell traveled in a straight line at a distance determined by the casters power. The spell needed to pass within one mile (1.6 km) of another member to alert them that the caster needed aid. Other members received a glimpse of the trouble the caster was in and their general location.\nThis spell required a societal amulet to cast."
