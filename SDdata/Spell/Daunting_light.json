        "mainbody": "'''''Daunting light''''' was an encounter prayer available to [[cleric]]s during the post-[[Spellplague]] era that would hurt and hinder opponents with radiant light.",
        "Effects": "Casting ''daunting light'' upon a target creature caused a fiery column of light to engulf them, burning the opponent with [[radiant energy]] and causing their movements to be hindered for a short time. This allowed one of the caster's nearby allies a more advantageous position in combat when striking against the target.",
        "Components": "Casting this spell required an [[implement]] of some kind, likely taking the form of the cleric's [[holy symbol]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1420}}, a party of four [[Daggerdale]]smen [[adventurer]]s were [[teleport|summoned]] to the [[mines of Tethyamar]] by the [[Banite]] priestess [[Lorin-Aria]] to kill the [[Zhent]] wizard [[Rezlus]] and put an end to his plans to conquer Daggerdale and the greater [[Dalelands]] region. Among this party of adventurers was a [[dwarf]] [[cleric]] who knew the prayer ''daunting light''."
