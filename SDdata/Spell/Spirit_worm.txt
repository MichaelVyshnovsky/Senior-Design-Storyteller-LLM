Spirit worm was a necromancy spell used by wizards and sorcerers.
This spell created a persistent decay in both the body and spirt of the target. This effect manifested as either a small amount of physical harm or a slight weakening of the targets overall constitution.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a piece of fire-blackened ivory or bone carved in the shape of a worm to cast.
