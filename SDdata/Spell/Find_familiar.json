        "mainbody": "'''''Find familiar''''' was a [[conjuration]] ritual that bound a spirit to a [[warlock]] or [[wizard]] in the form of a [[familiar]].",
        "Effects": "Familiars summoned in this way were spirits of either [[celestial]], [[fey]] or [[fiend]]ish nature, depending on the caster's choice, that took the form of an animal, also of the caster's choice. Subsequent castings of the ritual changed the form the spirit took to that of another animal. Typical choices included [[bat]]s, [[cat]]s, [[crab]]s, [[frog]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[Octopus|octopi]], [[owl]]s, [[snake]]s, [[fish]], [[rat]]s, [[raven]]s, [[sea horse]]s, [[spider]]s, and [[weasel]]s, although warlocks could be granted other forms by their patrons, such as [[imp]]s, [[pseudodragon]]s, [[quasit]]s, or [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]]s. [[tressym]], [[cranium rat]]s, [[crawling claw]]s, and [[gazer]]s.\n\nFamiliars thus summoned had the usual link with their masters, such as a telepathic link over some distance, which included the ability for the caster to see through the creature's eyes, the ability to relay touch-based [[spells]] and the ability to be temporarily or permanently dismissed. Only one familiar could be bound to a spellcaster at any given time.\n\nIf a familiar summoned by this spell were killed, it could reappear by a subsequent casting of the ritual.\n\nWhen cast on [[Avernus]], the first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], the result was invariably an imp.",
        "Components": "The spell needed [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The materials needed were charcoal, incense, and herbs—[[basil]], [[savory]], and [[catnip]]—that needed to be burned in a [[brazier]] made of [[brass]] as part of the ritual, with the charcoal used to stoke the brazier. Fat may also be burned. These materials were valued as much as 100 [[gp]] to as little as 10 gp.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Zahn]] in {{Yearlink|-925}} and was originally called ''Zahn's familiar''.\n\nIn the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''find familiar'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}"
