        "mainbody": "'''''Omen''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] and [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "A caster used this spell to predict the outcome of an adventure or an event such as a battle. During casting, a wu jen communicated with [[spirit]]s and a shugenja communicated with their deity. When a shugenja cast this spell, they remained motionless and waited for a sign from their deity. Spirits and deities were sporadic with the omens and they were challenging to interpret correctly. The spell took a substantial physical and mental toll on the caster, and even the most powerful shugenja or wu jen was only able to cast this spell once a week.",
        "Components": "For a shugenja, only a [[verbal component]] was required. For a wu jen, both a verbal and a [[material component]] were required. During casting, the wu jen needed to burn small pieces of [[paper]] written with the four directions."
