        "mainbody": "Omen was a common spell used by shugenja and wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nA caster used this spell to predict the outcome of an adventure or an event such as a battle. During casting, a wu jen communicated with spirits and a shugenja communicated with their deity. When a shugenja cast this spell, they remained motionless and waited for a sign from their deity. Spirits and deities were sporadic with the omens and they were challenging to interpret correctly. The spell took a substantial physical and mental toll on the caster, and even the most powerful shugenja or wu jen was only able to cast this spell once a week.\nFor a shugenja, only a verbal component was required. For a wu jen, both a verbal and a material component were required. During casting, the wu jen needed to burn small pieces of paper written with the four directions."
