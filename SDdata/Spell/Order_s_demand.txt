Orders demand was a channel divinity power granted to clerics who chose the Order domain.
Order domain clerics could channel divinity by displaying their holy symbol. All creatures of the clerics choosing (as long as they could be seen and heard within ) would become charmed, should they be unable to resist. The intimidated creature could be forced to drop whatever they were holding.
