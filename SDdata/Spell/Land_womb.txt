Land womb was an abjuration spell used by druids, hathrans and rangers.
When cast, this spell caused its caster, and one or more other creatures, to descend 10 feet into the ground. All the targets of the spell beyond the caster had to be in contact with one another (i.e. they were all holding hands in a chain). It would only worked if cast over movable earth, such as soil or dirt, and not over solid stone.
The occupants of the land womb were encapsulated in a protective bubble, that was undetectable except by magical means The space was too tight to take actions or cast spells, but had enough room for them to comfortably breathe and speak. Once the duration of the spell was over, they were safely ejected to the earth exactly where they stood when the spell was cast.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
