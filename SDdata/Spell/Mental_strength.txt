'''''Mental strength''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[sohei]] and [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
A shugenja used this spell to protect themselves or others from charms, enchantments, [[illusion]]s, possession, and telepathic attacks. It provided protection against various spells such as ''[[fear]]'', ''[[Hypnotism|hypnosis]]'', and ''[[suggestion]]''. The reverse of the spell was ''[[mental weakness]]''. It had the opposite affect, lowering a creature's mental fortitude against mental attacks.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: the tail from a [[fox]].
