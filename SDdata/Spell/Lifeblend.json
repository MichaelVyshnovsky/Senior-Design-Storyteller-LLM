        "mainbody": "'''''Lifeblend''''' was a powerful [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that permanently fused two or more separate life forms into one creature.",
        "Effects": "The subjects of this spell could be any type of plant or animal so long as they were alive. The caster was unable to cast other spells for a full day after casting ''lifeblend''.\n\nEach subject was placed into a special cage. The caster touched each subject at the same time during the casting, which by default meant that a maximum of four subjects could be used for a caster with two hands and two feet. The caster concentrated intensely on the desired form the new creature would take, otherwise the spell would fail. If any of the subjects resisted the spell's magic the caster would be struck with a backlash that imparted traits from the subjects onto them for several days. A successful casting resulted in the creation of a new creature with features and abilities of all subjects involved.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a special cage for each subject made from precious metal worth at least 2,500 [[gp]] each, a candle for each creature, and a [[ruby]] worth at least 5,000 [[gp]] to cast. The candles were placed together and lit during the beginning of the casting so that the wax had time to blend together. The ruby represented a heart and was placed between the candles and eventually covered in the melted wax. All of the components were consumed during the casting.",
        "History": "This spell was included in [[Kyristan's Mysteries]]."
