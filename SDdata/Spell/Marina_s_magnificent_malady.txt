'''''Marina's magnificent malady''''' was a devilish [[alteration]] [[spell]] that reversed the [[enchainments]] of magic items for a prolonged period of time.

==Effects==
When cast, ''Marina's magnificent malady'' inverted all enchantments weaved into the target magic item. The spell was always successful, and only items that gave the wearer increased protection, like ''[[bracers of defense]]'' or ''[[Scarabs of protection]]'' had a chance to resist the spell. Positive enchantments became negative, ''[[light]]'' became ''[[darkness]]'', etc. This spell only affected items and never active spell effects.

''Marina's magnificent malady'' could be cast at a distance of up to one hundred yards and could affect more than one item within one hundred yards. The reversal lasted for 12 hours, and its duration increased in 12-hour increments with the spell's power.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]] components to be cast.

==History==
''Marina's magnificent malady'' was the creation of [[Marina Waterdale]], a [[wizard]] in the employ of [[Kimber Gallen]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The spell was unleashed on magic items during a party hosted by Lady [[Charis Stone]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}.{{Cite organized play/LC/The "Life" of the Party|22}}
