'''''Death talisman''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the [[Land of Fate]]. This spell was usable by [[wizard]]s and [[priest]]s ([[cleric]]s).

==Effects==
''Death talisman'' allowed the caster to enchant a small item and link it to their health. The enchanted item would remain in the exact same condition that it was when the spell was cast so long as the caster remained healthy. When the caster died, the item would corrode and fall apart. The caster needed to remain within 1,000 miles (1609 kilometers) of the item for the enchantment to remain.

Given the large range of the spell, this was especially useful for a wizard's companion's equipment. Archers with their bows enchanted with this spell never had to worry about water damage, breaking their bow, etc.

This duration of this spell was based on the caster's power.

==Components==
The only component needed to cast this spell was the item that was to be enchanted.
