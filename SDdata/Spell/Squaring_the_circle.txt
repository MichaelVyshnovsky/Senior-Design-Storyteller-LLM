Squaring the circle was an alteration spell that allowed a wizard to modify the shape of the effective area of other spells. Square or cubic areas could be changed to circular or spherical or vice-versa a square into a rectangle or a circle or sphere into an oval or egg shape.
The creation of squaring the circle was attributed to young archmage Sammaster, in the period of his delving into metamagic in the late 830s DR, though it was unclear if he indeed developed the spell himself, or was merely instrumental in its rediscovery and subsequent distribution.
