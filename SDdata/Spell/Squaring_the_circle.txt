}}'''''Squaring the circle''''' was an [[alteration]] spell that allowed a [[wizard]] to modify the shape of the effective area of other spells. Square or cubic areas could be changed to circular or spherical or vice-versa; a square into a rectangle; or a circle or sphere into an oval or egg shape.

==History==
The creation of ''squaring the circle'' was attributed to young [[archmage]] [[Sammaster]], in the period of his delving into [[metamagic]] in the [[840 DR|late 830s DR]], though it was unclear if he indeed developed the spell himself, or was merely instrumental in its rediscovery and subsequent distribution.<ref>
