The undersea realm of [[Ser√¥s]] had a [[divine magic|divine]] version of this spell, that the [[cleric]]s of the [[animal sphere|animal]] and [[divination sphere|divination]] [[sphere]]s were able to cast.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to speak with any creature of the sea that had at least animal intelligence. The caster could understand the creature and be understood as well.To communicate effectively the caster needed to be able to breathe underwater, otherwise the caster needed to remain above the water but within hearing range of the creature when speaking.",
        "Components": "This spell required a [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] component, as well as a [[material component]] in the form of a small trumpet made of shell to cast. The divine version of this spell required only a verbal component and the trumpet, but also the cleric's [[holy symbol]]."
