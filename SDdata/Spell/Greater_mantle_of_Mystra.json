        "mainbody": "'''''Greater mantle of Mystra''''' was an improved version of the [[abjuration]] spell, ''[[mantle of Mystra]]''.",
        "Effects": "When cast, ''greater mantle'' protected the caster or another individual from a specific spell or spell-like effect. It absorbed the effects of the spell, or [[magic]]al item discharge, then allowed the recipient of its effects to make a choice. The bearer of the ''greater mantle'' could use the absorbed magical energy to heal themself, or launch a different, specific spell towards another individual.\n\nThe spell from which the recipient was protected, along with the spell that was \"reflected\", were both chosen by caster during the casting of ''greater mantle''. The latter of these spells had to be of equal or lesser power than the former.\n\nMultiple castings of this spell could not be placed on the same individual at the same time, nor could they be combined with the effects of ''mantle of Mystra''.\n\nThe protection conferred by the ''greater mantle'' lasted at least an hour, and was not stopped by the effects of a single spell casting. However, the protection could be removed by a single casting of ''[[dispel magic]]''.",
        "History": "This spell was only used by priests of the [[Church of Mystra]], and was only written in some extremely rare tomes.\nThere was a variation of ''greater mantle'' known as ''[[Azuth's alteration mantle]]''.\n\nThe specifications of this spell could be displayed by the [[relic]] known as the ''[[Scepter of Mystra]]''.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast."
