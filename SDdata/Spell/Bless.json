        "mainbody": "'''''Bless''''' was an [[enchantment]] or [[conjuration]] spell that temporarily increased the morale and combat skill of allies. The conjuration version of this spell was reversible and was called '''''curse''''', also known as ''[[bane (spell)|bane]]'', and temporarily lowered the morale and combat skill of enemies.",
        "Effects": "Those allies ''blessed'' were granted a brief boost to their morale in the face of fear and a slight improvement in combat skill that increased their chance to strike a blow or aim true.\n\nThe conjuration version of this spell had to be cast just before the recipients engaged in combat. It could also be used to enhance a single weapon or item, such as a sword, an arrow, or a sling bullet, improving the chance to hit an enemy.\n\n''Bless'' countered and dispelled ''[[Bane (spell)|bane]]'' or ''curse'', and vice versa.\n\nThe sundering version of the spell could only effect 3 allies and gave a minor bonus to attacks and recistence to effects. If used with more skill the spell could effect a higher number of targets. Unlike the earlier versions this does effect the Bane spell",
        "Components": "The enchantment version of this spell required verbal and somatic components and the caster's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]]. The conjuration version also required (un)holy water. The sundering version required a sprinkle of holy water."
