'''''Shoondal's seeking''''' was a [[divination]] [[wizard]] [[spell]].

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to visualize every key, lock, or other fastening device within {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}}. Such items glowed bright gold to the caster's eyes even if concealed by materials up to {{SI|3|in|long=yes}} thick. The caster was able to see these items through magical disguises.

Any enchanted locks or keys glowed red to the caster and traps or alarms glowed blue. If one of these items was both enchanted and trapped, then the red glow would overshadow the blue, thus hiding the trap from the caster.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]] a key to cast. The key was consumed during the casting.
