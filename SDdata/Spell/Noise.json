        "mainbody": "Noise was a minor illusion cantrip that apprentice illusionists could learn. It generated an illusory but unintelligible sound of whatever the caster desired and could vaguely imitate.\nThe target of this spell had to be within  of the caster and the area of effect was a circle  in diameter centered on the target point. All hearing creatures in the area had a chance to resist the spell and, if successful, heard nothing out of the ordinary. This cantrip could not imitate intelligible speech. Examples of the use of noise included the susurration of voices behind a door, the whoosh of wings or wind, the murmuring of a brook, or the scuff of feet or objects being moved.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster pointed at the desired center of the illusion and subvocalized an imitation of the desired noise."
