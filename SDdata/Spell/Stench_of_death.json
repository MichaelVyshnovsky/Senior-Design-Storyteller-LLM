        "mainbody": "'''''Stench of death''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell filled an area with an overpowering revolting smell of decay and death. Creatures within 50 feet (15 meters) of the wu jen experienced severe disorientation as a result of the smell. Wind could not clear the area of the smell, but spells such as ''[[dispel magic]]'' would. After a creature left the affected area or the spell expired, they required a period of time to recover their senses.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a rotting piece of flesh or organ."
