        "mainbody": "'''''Blade of memory''''' was an [[evocation]] spell that created a magical weapon in the caster's hand.",
        "Effects": "For the ''blade of memory'' to be cast, the [[wizard]] needed to touch an edged weapon of any kind that the spell consumed. At a later date, anytime after the spell was cast, the wizard could utter a word to \"recall\" a [[ghost]]ly version of the weapon consumed during the casting. The spell remained active as long as the caster remained alive, was not a target of the ''[[dispel magic]]'', or the caster replaced the memorized ''blade of memory'' spell with another.\n\nThe weapon that served as the spell's component could be any edged weapon that the caster could hold in one hand. They did not need to know how to wield the said weapon. When the ''blade of memory'' was activated, it remained affixed to the caster's hand and visible to all. The translucent weapon was intangible. It could not be dropped, thrown, or passed to another creature; it was not affected by electricity or magnetism, nor could it actually cut or slash objects. The weapon only became solid for a moment when hitting its intended target. The target was a single creature or object mentally selected by the caster each time the ''blade of memory'' was activated.\n\nWhen summoned, the ''blade of memory'' was at its strongest, being equal to a magic blade of a ''+4'' [[enchantment]] strength. With each passing minute, the ''blade of memory'' became weaker, eventually vanishing as the enchantment strength passed ''+1'' potency. The caster could dismiss the blade at will but was unable to make it reappear after one use.\n\nThis spell was simple magic, something [[Mordenkainen]] called \"apprentice tools\" and [[Elminster Aumar]] â€“ \"the stock-in-trade of us all.\"",
        "Components": "The ''blade of memory'' required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and material component to be cast.",
        "History": "''Blade of memory'' was one of the spells that originated from one of two worlds: [[Toril]] or [[Oerth]]. The spell, along with several others, was exchanged between Elminster, Mordenkainen, and [[Rautheene]] of Oerth, during one of their visits to the home of [[Ed Greenwood]] on [[Earth]]."
