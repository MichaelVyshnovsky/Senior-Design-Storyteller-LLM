        "mainbody": "Blade of memory was an evocation spell that created a magical weapon in the casters hand.\nFor the blade of memory to be cast, the wizard needed to touch an edged weapon of any kind that the spell consumed. At a later date, anytime after the spell was cast, the wizard could utter a word to \"recall\" a ghostly version of the weapon consumed during the casting. The spell remained active as long as the caster remained alive, was not a target of the dispel magic, or the caster replaced the memorized blade of memory spell with another.\nThe weapon that served as the spells component could be any edged weapon that the caster could hold in one hand. They did not need to know how to wield the said weapon. When the blade of memory was activated, it remained affixed to the casters hand and visible to all. The translucent weapon was intangible. It could not be dropped, thrown, or passed to another creature it was not affected by electricity or magnetism, nor could it actually cut or slash objects. The weapon only became solid for a moment when hitting its intended target. The target was a single creature or object mentally selected by the caster each time the blade of memory was activated.\nWhen summoned, the blade of memory was at its strongest, being equal to a magic blade of a +4 enchantment strength. With each passing minute, the blade of memory became weaker, eventually vanishing as the enchantment strength passed +1 potency. The caster could dismiss the blade at will but was unable to make it reappear after one use.\nThis spell was simple magic, something Mordenkainen called \"apprentice tools\" and Elminster Aumar â€“ \"the stock-in-trade of us all.\"\nThe blade of memory required verbal, somatic, and material component to be cast.\nBlade of memory was one of the spells that originated from one of two worlds Toril or Oerth. The spell, along with several others, was exchanged between Elminster, Mordenkainen, and Rautheene of Oerth, during one of their visits to the home of Ed Greenwood on Earth."
