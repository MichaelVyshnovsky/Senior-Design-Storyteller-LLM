'''''Trap spellbook''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that protected a [[book]], more often a [[mage|mage's]] ''[[spellbook]]'', from being being opened by anyone other than its owner.

==Effects==
In a manner similar to ''[[explosive runes]]'', ''trap spellbook'' created [[arcane]] [[rune]]s upon the targeted book that, when opened by anyone but the spell's caster, caused a massive explosion. There was little chance anyone could see the effects of the spell, unless they were aided by a [[divination]] or a similarly functioning magical item, though it could be easily removed with a casting of ''[[dispel magic]]''.

Any affected book was unharmed by triggering the spell. Upon its closing, the effects were renewed as if ''trap spellbook'' had just been cast. The original caster would freely remove the runes at will.

==Usage==
This spell was commonly used by the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]].
