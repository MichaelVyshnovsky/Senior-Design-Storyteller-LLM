        "Effects": "''Towerfall'', quite simply, lifted and knocked over huge stone structures, like castle towers, bridges, and city walls.\n\nA variant of ''towerfall'' was ''[[stone fountain]]''.",
        "History": "[[Inhil Lauthdryn|Inhil \"Hurler-of-Stars\" Lauthdryn]], the [[Magister]] from [[1282 DR|1282]] to [[1294 DR]], had a special love of blowing up castles, hence his creation of ''towerfall''. He particularly enjoyed the spell, but he took its secrets to his grave in the [[1294 DR|Year of the Deep Moon, 1294 DR]]."
