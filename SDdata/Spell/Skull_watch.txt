'''''Skull Watch''''' was a [[necromantic]] [[ritual]] that existed during the post-[[Spellplague]] era, which could turn any skull into a silent intruder alarm.

==Effects==
For a duration of 4 hours any skull enchanted by ''Skull Watch'' would mentally alert its enchanter, if within {{SI|1|mile|long=yes}} of them, when they detected an intruder. Skulls could only detect visually, not audibly or through smell, and destruction of the skull would not trigger an alert. For the duration of the ritual the caster could at any time view through the eye-sockets of the skull, though would not have use of their own eyesight while doing so.

The enchantment process took around 10 minutes to complete. During this time the caster could also designate one or more individuals or categories of creatures for the skull to not recognize as intruders, the latter including such things as creatures of a certain type, a certain race, or creatures wielding certain equipment.

==Components==
Casting this ritual required [[material component]]s costing around 80 [[gold piece]]s on average, with the most important component being a skull.

==History==
Around the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[human]] necromancer was operating in [[Tymanther]], in an ancient [[Unther]]i burial site near [[Ruinspoke]]. The necromancer made their lair within the depths of a mauseoleum and placed within its entrance level a human skull enchanted with ''Skull Watch'' to guard against intruders.It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or [[Tymanchebar]]. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of "the old Untheric Empire" and the presence of a [[Lathander]]ite sarcophagus in the mausoleum, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther. This skull would alert him to the presence of the [[dwarf]] [[Melnar]], a member of the [[Gem Assayers Union]], snooping about the ruins. Some time after having had his [[undead]] minions drag the dwarf down into his lair,{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|5}} a group of [[adventurer]]s were hired by [[Dirnth]], another member of the Gem Assayers Union, to find him. They eventually ventured into the mausoleum in search of him, where they were either spotted by the skull or managed to evade it before it could alert the necromancer of their presence.{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|15}}
