        "mainbody": "'''''Spirit quest''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[divination]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Uthgar]], enabling them to grant vision quests to a recipient.",
        "Effects": "This spell combined the ''[[quest]]'' spell with a series of visions that led a willing recipient along a special quest. These visions were communicated by the totem spirit of the beast cult. The interpretation of these visions was left entirely up to the recipient. The spell would end if the recipient admitted failure and the carried token would crumble to dust. Failure during a ''spirit quest'' resulted in a loss of status within the recipient's tribe, but successfully completing a ''spirit quest'' made them a legend, resulting in a permanent boon of power from the tribe's totem spirit.\n\nA ''spirit quest'' could only be attempted once per an individual's lifetime.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal component]]s and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]], a bundle of strong herbs and incense to cast."
