        "mainbody": "Spirit quest was a powerful divine divination spell used by specialty priests devoted to Uthgar, enabling them to grant vision quests to a recipient.\nThis spell combined the quest spell with a series of visions that led a willing recipient along a special quest. These visions were communicated by the totem spirit of the beast cult. The interpretation of these visions was left entirely up to the recipient. The spell would end if the recipient admitted failure and the carried token would crumble to dust. Failure during a spirit quest resulted in a loss of status within the recipients tribe, but successfully completing a spirit quest made them a legend, resulting in a permanent boon of power from the tribes totem spirit.\nA spirit quest could only be attempted once per an individuals lifetime.\nIn addition to verbal components and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol, a bundle of strong herbs and incense to cast."
