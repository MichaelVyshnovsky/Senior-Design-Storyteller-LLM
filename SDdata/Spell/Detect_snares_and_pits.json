        "mainbody": "Detect snares and pits was a divination spell that made the caster aware of pits, deadfalls, and snares in a chosen direction.\nThis spell could detect terrain hazards, creature hazards, and even magical hazards as long as they were not mechanically complex and resembled pits, deadfalls, or snares. Sinkholes, trapdoor spiders, ant lions, hunting snares, quicksand, unstable rock walls, trip and snare spells, and spike/spear/crossbow traps and the like were all detectable by this spell. The caster experienced a premonition of danger when facing a hazard, which increased as he or she closed the distance. The older version of detect snares and pits divined in a corridor  by .\nThe newer version had a cone-shaped area of effect that extended  from the caster. The newer version also revealed more information the longer the caster concentrated in a particular direction. Not only the presence of hazards, but their number and location (if within line of sight), and finally the type of one hazard and its triggering mechanism or conditions could be determined. Other hazards could be scrutinized in turn as long as the spell remained active.\nThis spell could penetrate barriers, but  of stone,  of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or  of wood or dirt would block it.\nAll versions of this spell required verbal and somatic components. The older versions of this spell also required the casters holy symbol or mistletoe."
