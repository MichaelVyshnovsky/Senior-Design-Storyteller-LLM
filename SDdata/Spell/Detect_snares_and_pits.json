        "mainbody": "'''''Detect snares and pits''''' was a [[divination]] spell that made the caster aware of pits, deadfalls, and [[snare (trap)|snares]] in a chosen direction.",
        "Effects": "This spell could detect terrain hazards, creature hazards, and even magical hazards as long as they were not mechanically complex and resembled pits, deadfalls, or snares. Sinkholes, [[trapdoor spider]]s, [[ant lion]]s, hunting snares, [[quicksand]], unstable rock walls, ''[[trip]]'' and ''[[snare]]'' spells, and [[spike]]/[[spear]]/[[crossbow]] traps and the like were all detectable by this spell. The caster experienced a premonition of danger when facing a hazard, which increased as he or she closed the distance. The older version of ''detect snares and pits'' divined in a corridor {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} by {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nThe newer version had a cone-shaped area of effect that extended {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} from the caster. The newer version also revealed more information the longer the caster concentrated in a particular direction. Not only the presence of hazards, but their number and location (if within line of sight), and finally the type of one hazard and its triggering mechanism or conditions could be determined. Other hazards could be scrutinized in turn as long as the spell remained active.\n\nThis spell could penetrate barriers, but {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} of stone, {{SI|1|in|long=yes}} of common metal, a thin sheet of [[lead]], or {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} of wood or dirt would block it.",
        "Components": "All versions of this spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s. The older versions of this spell also required the caster's [[holy symbol]] or [[mistletoe]]."
