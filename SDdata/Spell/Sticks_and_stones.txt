'''''Sticks and stones''''' was a [[necromancy]] spell that would animate a pile of natural debris into a [[skeleton]]-like creation. The caster would designate a pile of wooden rubbish, just as rocks, sticks or tree limbs, and they would animate together into a crude, [[humanoid]] construct. 

This being would immediately attack whomever the caster designated. It had no intelligence beyond this but was capable of [[energy drain|draining energy]] like a [[wight]].
