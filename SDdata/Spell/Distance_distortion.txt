Distance distortion was a common alteration spell.
When cast, this spell modified the area of an enclosed space. Since the spell was Earth-based, the enclosed area had to be surrounded by rock, sand, or soil. For the spell to be successful, the caster first had to cast conjure elemental to summon an earth elemental. The caster then must announce their intention to cast an distance distortion spell to the newly summoned earth elemental, to prevent the earth elemental from fighting the caster or attempting to break its summoning. 
The spell used the earth elemental to increase or decrease, depending on the needs of the caster, the area of the targeted enclosed space. The magically modified area was not detectable by mundane means but a true seeing spell was able to detect the faint magical aura radiating from the modified space. Once the spell was completed, the earth elemental returned to its home plane.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a small amount of soft clay.
Distance distortion was invented in  by the Netherese arcanist Fjord with the name Fjords distortion.
