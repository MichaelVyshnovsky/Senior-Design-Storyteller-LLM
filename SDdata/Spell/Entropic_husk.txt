Entropic husk was a conjuration spell of epic magic, granted to or developed and used by some of the most powerful arcane scholars of Candlekeep, arcane tricksters, druids, eldritch knights, pale masters, Red Wizards, sorcerers, spirit shamans, stormlords, warlocks, and wizards, who were masters of spellcraft and could access the 9 circle of magic.
With a touch, the spellcaster transformed a single creature into a thing of chaos and fury, forcing it to uncontrollably attack everyone around indiscriminately. The spell, if taken hold, instantly destroyed the creatures soul and filled its body with primal entropy, reanimating it as a fierce juggernaut of all-consuming destruction. The husks strength and constitution increased to unnatural levels. The juggernaut continued its raging for two full minutes until the reanimated body burned into nothing but ash and dust.
To cast entropic husk, the caster had to use verbal and somatic components.
