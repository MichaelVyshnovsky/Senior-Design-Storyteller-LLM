        "mainbody": "'''''Sparkles ''''' was a [[conjuration]] spell that created a cloud of glowing, multicolored particles that would rain outward from the caster. The sparkling motes would attach and outline any living creature they landed upon and could not be removed except my magical means. They would continue to twinkle and shine for the spell's duration, illuminating any invisible creatures or persons they landed upon. \n\nThis spell was extremely popular during [[Halruaa]]n festivals, where the sparkles would be released from the [[Halruaan skyship|skyships]] over the celebrants in the cities.",
