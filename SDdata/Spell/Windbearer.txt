'''''Windbearer''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Akadi]], enabling them to create a pillar of air.

==Effects==
This spell created a pillar of air with a {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} diameter. The height of the pillar and the amount of upward force generated by the pillar was determined by the priest's skill. The pillar could lift creatures and objects to its top if it was strong enough to overcome their weight. The height of the pillar could be adjusted with the caster's concentration.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast.
