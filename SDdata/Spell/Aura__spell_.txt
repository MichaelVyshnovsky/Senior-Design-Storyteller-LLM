Aura was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, a wu jen was able to read the alignment and magical abilities of creatures and items within an area. An aura would also surround buildings to indicate the dominant alignment of the occupants. This spell also revealed unwarded magic.  
The reverse of the spell, mask, hid the aura of a building from detection. The duration of this spell was one week. 
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
