        "mainbody": "'''''Alvira's Stasis Shell''''' was a very rare spell that [[Alvira]] created to protect objects.",
        "Effects": "The spell placed a faint blue glow upon the object that it was cast upon, which had to be between the sizes of a potion vial and a normal spellbook; the object became impossible to affect with anything short of ''[[disintegrate]]'' or a successful ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell. Though the object could be moved normally, unlike in stronger stasis spells, it was impossible to affect it much. Most attacks, even [[dragon breath]], would simply slide off around the protected item. Though it could not affect living tissue directly, there had been reports of it working on living tissue inside an inanimate container. For all intents and purposes, time had stopped for the object within the field.",
        "Components": "Besides [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell involved the protected object in its magic.Though the spell is supposed to have a material component, neither source speaks of what it is.",
        "History": "The spell had been developed by [[Alvira]], a hedge wizard of [[Raven's Bluff]];The original says that she hid her spellbook combining this spell with ''[[extension]]''; this is considered to be an error in this article, as no ''extension'' spell extant at the time of publishing could affect 6th level spells."
