Haunted visions was a divine divination and enchantment spell used by specialty priests devoted to Savras called Sibylites, enabling them to overwhelm a target with a barrage of visions of the consequences of their decisions.
This spell allowed the caster to afflict a target with visions that revealed every possible consequence of every decision they made, incapacitating the target with the overflow of overlapping information. The effects of this spell lasted for 4â€“10 minutes unless successfully dispelled. While experiencing the onslaught of visions the target could only move at one quarter of their normal walking speed, could not focus on performing any actions involving thought, and was easily attacked.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the material components required for this spell were the priests holy symbol and a puff of smoke. The smoke was blown in the direction of the spell during casting.
