        "mainbody": "'''''Dehydrate''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that caused a desiccating effect on the target.",
        "Effects": "On casting ''dehydrate'', the caster was cursed with loss of [[water]]. This had devastating effects on the target's health, the extent of which increased with the caster's skill. If the target was a creature that had an unusual amount of water as part of its being, like [[ooze]]s, the drying effect was even more severe.",
        "Components": "''Dehydrate'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s, but also a [[divine focus]]."
