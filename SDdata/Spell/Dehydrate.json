        "mainbody": "Dehydrate was a necromancy spell that caused a desiccating effect on the target.\nOn casting dehydrate, the caster was cursed with loss of water. This had devastating effects on the targets health, the extent of which increased with the casters skill. If the target was a creature that had an unusual amount of water as part of its being, like oozes, the drying effect was even more severe.\nDehydrate required somatic and verbal components, but also a divine focus."
