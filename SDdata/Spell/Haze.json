        "mainbody": "Haze was a minor illusion cantrip that illusionists-in-training could learn. It slightly obscured vision in a small area for a short time.\nThe target of this cantrip had to be within  of the caster and the area of effect was a  cube. For one minute, vision in the target area was somewhat impaired as if there were smoke or dust particles drifting in the air. This made it slightly easier to successfully hide in shadows, and any targeted spellcasting or missile launching into, out of, or through the effect of haze had a marginally smaller chance of success. Likewise, targets of spells or missile attacks had a slightly improved chance to avoid being hit. Rain, a breeze, or a gust of wind negated this cantrip.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster waved their hands as if obscuring something while humming a little tune."
