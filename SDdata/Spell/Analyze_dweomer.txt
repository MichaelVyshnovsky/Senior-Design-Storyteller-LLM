'''''Analyze dweomer''''' was a powerful [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[divination]] [[spell]] that revealed a target's full magical history.

==Effects==
This spell worked on both creatures and objects, revealing the presence of enchantments, [[dweomer]]s, and other magical properties. Information was revealed to the caster in the order that it was cast or applied to the target. Each casting of ''analyze dweomer'' worked for a single target item or creature.

This spell took a heavy toll on the caster, often exhausting them for several hours after the spell ended.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a small lens of [[ruby]] or [[sapphire]] set in a [[gold]] hoop to cast. The [[gemstone]] needed to be worth at least 1,000 [[gp]]

==History==
This spell was used by [[Dyrr]], the Lichdrow of [[Menzoberranzan]].{{Cite dragon/312/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of the War of the Spider Queen, Part 2|84-85}}
