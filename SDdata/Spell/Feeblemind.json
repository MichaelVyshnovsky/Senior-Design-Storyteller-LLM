        "mainbody": "Feeblemind was a powerful enchantment spell that reduced a persons intelligence and personality to almost nothing.\nArcane spellcasters were quite vulnerable to the effects of this spell, which were hard to remove.\nThe Netherese arcanist Hamring was given the credit for the creation of this spell in , which was then known as Hamrings feeblemind.\nIn 1357 DR evil wizard Cassana placed a permanent version of this spell on the cell containing Finder Wyvernspur, rendering him mad and unable to escape.\nFeeblemind was a common spell in the Realms after 1358 DR."
