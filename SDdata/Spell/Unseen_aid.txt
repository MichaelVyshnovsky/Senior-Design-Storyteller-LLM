Unseen aid was a spell used by many sorcerers during their initial training. Using unseen aid granted arcane assistance to the caster, allowing them to perform a number of tasks with greater proficiency than they would otherwise be able to. Unseen aid was not particularly difficult to cast, taking only an instance to use and a rest of a few minutes or more to recharge.
