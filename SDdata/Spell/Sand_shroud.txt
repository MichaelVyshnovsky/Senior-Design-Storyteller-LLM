Sand shroud was a spell used by wizards in Anauroch and Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
With this spell the caster could open up an area of sand directly beneath a target and swallow them whole. This spell only worked over sand or loose earth. Only the dead, undead, or creatures that never lived, such as golems, could be targets of this spell. If cast successfully, this spell buried the target  under the sand and covered them up as if nothing happened.
This spell required a lump of mud, clay, dried dung, or other powdery substance to cast.
