'''''Warm''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that apprentice [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It raised the temperature of a quantity of liquid or solid matter.

==Effects==
This cantrip had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}.The original description of ''chill'' in [[Dragon magazine 59|''Dragon'' #59]] allowed for a limited effect on living things, but this was removed in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. Since this is the compliment of ''chill'', the same stipulation was applied. liquids and solids that amounted to no more than {{SI|1|cu ft|L|long=yes}} in volume. The rise in temperature was about 40 <span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">℉</span> ({{F2C|72}} <span style="font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;">℃</span>) but could not go above {{SI|140|F}}. The cantrip and temperature change were nearly instantaneous but thereafter the heated material acted normally in the conditions surrounding it, slowly cooling back down to the ambient temperature.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster vigorously rubbed both hands together and said ''aah''.
