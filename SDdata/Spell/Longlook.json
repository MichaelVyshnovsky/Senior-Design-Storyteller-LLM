        "mainbody": "Longlook was an elven spell that was used in the making of lesser enchanted items.\nA longlook spell was involved in making daggers that glowed upon command or would not rust. The spell made such enchantments endure for an expected duration of no less than three hundred years in at least one case.\nElminster Aumar, a Chosen of Mystra, sometimes cached daggers for others to find that were enchanted not to rust or to glow upon command. Such magics, at least once, were made with a longlook spell."
