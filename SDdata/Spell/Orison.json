        "mainbody": "An orison was the divine spellcasting equivalent to cantrip. Priests of all mythoi learned various orisons as acolytes.\nUnlike cantrip, an orison had a specific effect, but the priest could choose which effect at the time of casting. Orisons typically lasted one minute, but advanced worshipers could increase the duration. A typical student could master four orisons and cast them daily. As the priest gained experience in channeling divine power, more orisons could be cast per day.\nKnown orisons included\n Alleviate  Gave temporary relief from pain or nausea to a sick or wounded creature.\n Calm  Soothed a creature that had been startled or frightened.\n Clarity  Gave the priest the ability to speak clearly and be heard, usually when performing rites and rituals.\n Courage  Gave the priest a momentary boost to combat prowess.\n Guidance  Gave the priest clarity of thought to make better decisions.\n Healing  Allowed a healing touch for minor cuts and scratches.\n Magic sense  Gave a slight prickle of awareness when near a steady magic effect or item.\n Memory  For the duration of the spell, sights, sounds, and/or text and speech the caster wishes to remember are engraved in memory and are more likely to be recalled exactly as they were initially experienced.\n Resistance to magic  The caster gains a slightly better resistance to magical effects for one exposure to undesirable magic, or until the spell ends, whichever comes first.\n Resistance to poison  The caster gains a better chance to overcome the effects of one exposure to a poisonous substance, or until the spell ends, whichever comes first.\nWorshipers of evil or chaotic deities had offensive orisons, but they were quite rare.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast these minor spells."
