'''''Spider bite''''', also called '''''venom bite''''', was a [[spell]] that allowed the caster to deliver a [[spider]]'s poisonous bite.

==Effects==
''Spider bite'' gave the caster the ability to deliver [[poison]] via biting. The number of times this could be done and the toxicity of the poison increased with the caster's skill. The caster was as though under the effect of ''[[neutralize poison]]'' while this spell was in effect and therefore practically immune to their own poison.

This spell did not give the caster extraordinary biting strength. Therefore, the biting caster could only deliver the poison through exposed or clothed skin. For example, it was impossible for the caster to deliver the poison, if the target was armored.

Once cast, this spell could be held for days as long as the caster did not cast other spells.

==Components==
The spell required only somatic and verbal components.

==History==
The spell was associated with the [[drow]].

The spell was at some point, at latest by [[1372 DR]], turned into an inherent vile ability, which was granted to those who were good at befriending [[vermin]] by [[Lolth]]. In this incarnation, the ability could be used as often as the user wanted and the strength was dependent on the body's sturdiness and not divine spellcasting skill. It was also possible to deliver the poison into food or drink by mixing saliva into them. However, this usage came at the cost of weakening the poison.
