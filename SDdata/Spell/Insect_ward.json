        "mainbody": "'''''Insect ward''''' was a very rare [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast on a weapon, the spell created an invisible barrier up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} in height. The barrier extended between a pair of rune-covered stakes of wood placed by the caster into the ground during casting. The maximum distance between each stake was {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}}. This barrier turned away almost every single insect. Any insect trapped within the barrier became lethargic and slowly perished. The caster was capable of using this spell to only target specific insects. This was done by carving unique runes onto the wooden stakes. The spell had no effect on giant-sized insects or insects that were under the magical control of another. The spell was broken when one of the stakes was removed from the ground.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], the pair of rune-covered wooden stakes."
