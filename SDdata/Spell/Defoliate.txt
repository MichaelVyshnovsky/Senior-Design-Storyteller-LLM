Defoliate was a powerful arcane spell from the school of necromancy that allowed a wizard to kill a large swath of vegetation.
The magic of this spell caused all vegetation within the area of effect to die and turn to black ash. The size of the area to be affected was based upon the casters skill. Plant-like creatures were also killed. One full year would pass before any vegetation could return to the affected area. The caster was aged by a year when they cast defoliate.
In addition to somatic components, this spell required as material components sliver of charred wood and a petal from a withered flower to cast.
This spell was found within the Book of Shadows, a tome based upon the oration of the necromancer Nebt Bhakau of Zakhara.
