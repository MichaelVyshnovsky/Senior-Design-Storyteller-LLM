'''''Defoliate''''' was a powerful [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]] from the school of [[necromancy]] that allowed a [[wizard]] to kill a large swath of vegetation.

==Powers==
The magic of this spell caused all vegetation within the area of effect to die and turn to black ash. The size of the area to be affected was based upon the caster's skill. Plant-like creatures were also killed. One full year would pass before any vegetation could return to the affected area. The caster was aged by a year when they cast ''defoliate''.

==Components==
In addition to [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s sliver of charred wood and a petal from a withered flower to cast.

==History==
This spell was found within the ''[[Book of Shadows]]'', a [[tome]] based upon the oration of the [[necromancer]] [[Nebt Bhakau]] of [[Zakhara]].
