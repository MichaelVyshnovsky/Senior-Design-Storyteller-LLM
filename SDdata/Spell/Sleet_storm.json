        "mainbody": "Sleet storm was a conjuration spell that created a storm of sleet to rain down on foes, making it harder for them to see and move.\nUpon casting the spell, a great storm of sleet would be conjured. Rain and sleet would pour from the skies, blocking sight in every form, even darkvision. And torches or fires lit in the area would immediately be put out. The fallen sleet would cause the ground to become very icy, slowing creatures. If the creatures were unable to balance, they would not be able to move for a while, and could even fall over.\nThe spell required somatic, verbal, and material components. The material components were a small amount of water and dust."
