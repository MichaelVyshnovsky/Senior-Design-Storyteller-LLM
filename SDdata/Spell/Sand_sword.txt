Sand sword was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
Similar to the sand jambiya spell, this spell created a sharp blade out of sand. The blade could be as long as the casters arm. It was able to harm creatures that could only be injured by magical weapons.
This spell required enough sand to create the sword to cast.
