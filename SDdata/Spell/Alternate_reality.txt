Alternate reality was a wild magic alteration spell used by wild mages.
This spell allowed the caster to create a small change in probabilities. Though this change lasted for just a moment, it had a profound effect on a single recent event.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small unmarked die to cast.
