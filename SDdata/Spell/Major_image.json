        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to create an illusion that included sound, visual imagery, smell, and even temperature. The spectral image could be positioned at a great distance from the caster, and it could occupy a volume of 9,000 cubic feet or greater, depending on the power of the spellcaster.\n\nThe caster could control its movement by concentrating, and the illusion would remain for a short time after the caster ceased concentrating. If an opponent attacked the illusion, it would fade away, unless the caster were able to make the figment respond believably.",
        "Components": "[[Verbal component|Verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s and a bit of [[fleece]] as a [[spell focus]] were required to cast this spell.",
        "History": "The spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Carbury]] in {{Yearlink|-871}}, the same year in which he also created his [[Magic mouth|''mouth'']] spell."
