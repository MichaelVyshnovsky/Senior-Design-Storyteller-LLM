        "mainbody": "Dimensional lock was a spell that prevented extra-dimensional travel.\nWhen cast, this spell prevented extra-dimensional travel and teleportation within an area with a  radius. The spell did not affect an astral or ethereal form already within the area. It also did not prevent extra-planar perception. If a summoned extra-dimensional creature was slain while within the affected area, the spell did not interfere with their return to their home plane.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
