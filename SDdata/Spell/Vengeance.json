        "mainbody": "Vengeance was a powerful spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThis spell was rarely cast by wu jen and instead was saved for when they were near death. The spell allowed a wu jen to enact a final act of revenge on their target after their death. The spirit of the slain wu jen remained on the Prime Material Plane to fulfill the desired act. Their spirit was then consumed with the desire to carry out the final thought the wu jen had fixed in their mind at the moment of their death. The spirit disregarded the lives of others, its only goal was to carry out its final deed. Even friends and allies of the wu jen were at risk if they attempted to prevent the spirit from carrying out its duty. If the spirit was near their body, they would enter the corpse and reanimate it to accomplish the act of vengeance, otherwise they appeared as a ghost. Once the deed was fulfilled, the spirit vanished and was finally at rest.\nThis spell required only verbal components."
