        "mainbody": "Reed staff was a divine magic spell given to priests of Sheela Peryroyl, the Green Sister, and Yondalla, the Nurturing Matriarch. It temporarily turned a blade of grass into a quarterstaff.\nThis spell turned an ordinary blade of grass into a magical +0 quarterstaff that only the caster could use. If another being took possession or attempted to use it, the weapon was dispelled. Likewise, the reed staff could be destroyed by a successful dispel magic cast upon it, or touching an anti-magic shell or similar effect inimical to magic. The spell lasted for a minimum of four minutes (longer for more experienced casters) and the caster was not required to remain in contact with the quarterstaff once it had been created.\nThis spell required a verbal command, the priests holy symbol, a sliver of wood, and a blade of grass."
