'''''Stone body''''' was a [[spell]] similar to the ''[[iron body]]'' spell.

==Effects==
When cast, the caster's body was transformed into living stone. Their strength and weight increased dramatically. The spell reduced the caster's speed and they became vulnerable to effects or spells that were designed to target [[stone golem]]s.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a small stone. This stone could come from a castle wall, or as a piece from either a greater [[earth elemental]] or stone golem.
