        "mainbody": "'''''Omen''''' was a common [[divination]] [[spell]] that was available to numerous [[Faer√ªn]]ian [[priest]]s of various faiths.",
        "Effects": "This spell was used by a [[divine]] spellcaster to beseech their deity for advice regarding a binary choice that had been presented to them. When the spell was cast, there was a significant chance the priest would receive a symbolic, but definitive response either in the affirmative or negative. It was also possible they received no response whatsoever.\n\nIt should be noted that any divine \"signs\", or misleading coincidental occurrences, were up for interpretation by the priest.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, ''omen'' required a single [[gemstone]] worth at least 100 [[gp]], which was consumed during casting."
