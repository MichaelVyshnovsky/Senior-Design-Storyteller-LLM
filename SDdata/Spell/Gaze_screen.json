        "mainbody": "Gaze screen was a spell that provided a defence against certain spells. \nThis spell protected a targeted creature from effects and spells that relied on eye contact. When cast, a shimmering area appeared before the creatures eyes. This mirror-like area followed the creature and did not effect vision. However, gaze screen only provided protection about 50% of the time. \nThis spell required verbal and somatic components."
