        "mainbody": "'''''Jonstal's double wizardry''''' was an [[arcane]] [[alteration]] spell that allowed a [[wizard]] to cast the spells ''[[fly]]'' and ''[[non-detection]]'' simultaneously.{{Cite dragon/211/The Wizards Three: A Night of Shadows|86}}",
        "Effects": "The caster had to have memorized all three spells and not have cast either ''fly'' or ''non-detection'' before casting ''Jonstal's improved double wizardry'' (unless the wizard had those spells memorized more than once).\n\nOnce activated, both ''fly'' and ''non-detection'' took effect immediately on either the caster or a touched recipient.",
        "Components": "''Jonstal's improved double wizardry'' itself had only a [[verbal component]], but the [[material component]]s for both ''fly'' and ''non-detection'' were used as well.",
        "History": "This spell was invented by the [[archmage]], [[Jonstal]]. Despite much research, Jonstal was only ever able to pair these two spells and two other spells. The other two spells were cast using ''[[Jonstal's double wizardry]]''. To his credit, the only other being known to be able to cast two spells at once was [[Azuth]] himself.\n\nDuring one of their many spell-sharing sessions, [[Elminster]] shared this spell with the wizards [[Mordenkainen]] of [[Oerth]] and [[Dalamar]] of [[Krynn]].{{Cite dragon/211/The Wizards Three: A Night of Shadows|84}}"
