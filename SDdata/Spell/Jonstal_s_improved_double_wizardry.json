        "mainbody": "Jonstals double wizardry was an arcane alteration spell that allowed a wizard to cast the spells fly and non-detection simultaneously.\nThe caster had to have memorized all three spells and not have cast either fly or non-detection before casting Jonstals improved double wizardry (unless the wizard had those spells memorized more than once).\nOnce activated, both fly and non-detection took effect immediately on either the caster or a touched recipient.\nJonstals improved double wizardry itself had only a verbal component, but the material components for both fly and non-detection were used as well.\nThis spell was invented by the archmage, Jonstal. Despite much research, Jonstal was only ever able to pair these two spells and two other spells. The other two spells were cast using Jonstals double wizardry. To his credit, the only other being known to be able to cast two spells at once was Azuth himself.\nDuring one of their many spell-sharing sessions, Elminster shared this spell with the wizards Mordenkainen of Oerth and Dalamar of Krynn."
