'''''Summon monster VII''''', also known as '''''monster summoning VII''''', was a [[conjuration]] spell that called a creature to fight for the caster. The version that was more popular by the [[Year of Wild Magic]] summoned outsiders; prior, the most popular version summoned natural monsters instead. It was also the most powerful version of the ''[[summon monster]]'' series known up to that year.

==Effects==
''Summon monster VII'' functioned similarly to the spell able to be cast by less experienced casters: ''[[summon monster I]]''. However, this more powerful spell allowed the caster to summon monsters such as [[avoral]]s, [[djinni]], [[invisible stalker]]s, [[red slaad]]i, [[bone devil]] or [[babau]]. It could also summon [[elemental]]s the size of elephants, celestial [[elephant]]s, or fiendish [[monstrous scorpion]]s the size of elephants, [[megaraptor]]s and [[girallon]]s. In the water, it could summon celestial [[baleen whale]]s or fiendish [[giant octopus|giant octopi]]. It yielded one of those creatures; alternatively, it could be used to summon a greater number of monsters from a lower level spell.

The version most popular prior to {{yearlink|1372}} summoned instead a number of monsters native to the [[Prime Material plane|Prime]] instead. The number varied between one and three in all cases, and there was a delay of a minute:{{cite book/Monstrous Manual|377-378}}

The spell's yield in saltwater was altered to [[manta ray]]s, giant [[sea slug]]s, giant [[sea snake]]s, or giant [[squid]]s. In freshwater, the spell summoned [[giant catfish]]es, [[green hag]]s, [[water naga]]s, or giant [[sea snake]]s.{{cite book/Monstrous Manual|377-378}}

The earlier spell could also be made to summon even stronger monsters: by increasing the delay to two minutes and allowing for only a single monster to be summoned, the creature would instead number among [[rhinoceros beetle]]s, [[fire giant]]s, [[frost giant]]s, [[fomorian]]s, [[stone golem]]s, [[gorgimera]]s, 12-headed [[hydra]]s or 8-headed [[lernaean hydra]]s, [[brown pudding]]s, [[remorhaz]]es, [[rust monster]]s, [[will o'wisp]]s, or even [[purple worm]]s.{{cite book/Monstrous Manual|377-378}}

The increased delay, in fresh water, resulted in the summons answered by giant [[sea slug]]s, [[dragon turtle]]s, [[kuo-toa]] monitors, and [[purple worm|mottled worm]]s. In salt water, the effect was even more drastic, and could bring forth [[eye of the deep|eyes of the deep]], dragon turtles, [[kraken]], [[giant shark]]s, the largest of [[vodyanoi]], [[killer whale]]s, small herbivore [[whale]]s, and mottled worms. However, the caster ran a certain risk when they summoned a kraken or a vodyanoi. Those creatures were too willful for the spell's power to control them completely, and if commanded to act against their nature, there was a slim chance they might spurn the spell's yoke on their intentions and act free-willed for as long as the summon lasted.{{cite book/Monstrous Manual|377-378}}

==Descriptor note==
When this was used to summon creatures of a certain type, the spell itself would be considered a spell of the creature's type.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Lucke]] in {{YearlinkConvert|2080|NY}} and was originally called ''Lucke's 7th monster summons''.
