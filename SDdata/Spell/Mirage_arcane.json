        "mainbody": "Mirage arcane, sometimes known as mirage arcana, was a powerful illusion spell that could alter most aspects of the appearance of a vast area.\nFor up to 10 days, the spell could make terrain in a region as large as a square one mile (1.6 km) on one side assume the form of any other terrain. The illusion affected all sensory appearances visual, audible, tactile and olfactory. Even structures could be made to appear or be hidden by it. It could not, however, conceal creatures or create illusions of them.\nThe illusion could be detected via true seeing and creatures aware of it could see through it. However, it continued to physically manifest and interact with a creature aware of it.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Zahn in  and was originally known as Zahns mirage."
