Moment was a divine divination spell of the numbers sphere used by clerics to determine the precise point in time to perform an act with the greatest chance of success.
If cooperating with an ally, the caster could inform their companion when to execute a discussed action for the best possible results. The spell lasted for several minutes depending on the skill of the caster, but the caster needed to maintain their concentration in order to continue to provide advice to their companions on when to act.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a set of three silver dice that the caster tossed repeatedly in their hand while concentrating. The dice could be reused to cast the spell again.
Luckbringers, who were specialty priests devoted to Tymora, used the moment spell.
