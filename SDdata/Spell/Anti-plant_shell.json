        "mainbody": "Anti-plant shell was a divine abjuration spell from the plant and protection spheres that created a barrier that was impassable to all forms of plant life.\nThis spell created a protective invisible barrier measuring  in all directions. The barrier prevented all plant life, including treants and shambling mounds, from crossing for the duration of the spell.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThe Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the Mystran faith, could create anti-plant shells.\nIt was recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki."
