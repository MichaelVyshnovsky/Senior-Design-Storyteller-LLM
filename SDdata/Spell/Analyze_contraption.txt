'''Analyze Contraption''' was a spell for mechanical devices that could only be used by the [[gnome]] [[priest]]s of [[Nebelun]].

==Effects==
By touching any mechanical device they were unfamiliar with, the caster would receive a metal image of both the device's intended purpose and how it works. However, the spell would not determine for the caster how to operate the touched device.

This spell was known to work on any device, regardless of how complex it was. It was even known to work on unique [[artifact]]s such as the [[Apparatus of Kwalish]], the [[Machine of Lum the Mad]], and the [[Mighty Servant of Leuk-O]].

==Components==
This spell required a [[somatic component|somatic]] and [[verbal component]], as well as a [[material component]] in the form of the caster's [[holy symbol]].
