            "Living foci": "Rarely the chosen focus is a living plant, animal, or person, like a tree, a giant tortoise, or a faith healer. In addition to ''detect magic'', a ''[[detect charm]]'' would indicate a person was enchanted but without revealing anything specific.\n\nAt the end of the day-long ritual to cast ''focus'', the head priest or priests had 10 minutes to cast the spell to be amplified upon the focus.

These might include special vestments, burnt offerings, sacrifices, incense, dancing, songs, music, ritual combat, special foods, blessings, prayers, etc. The material components cost a minimum of 1,000 gp plus 100 gp per level of the spell being amplified and were given up, either as sacrifices to the deity, given to the poor, or otherwise spent."
