'''''Mistclaw''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that conjured a shadowy, semi-corporeal claw that mimicked the attacks of the caster.{{Cite dragon/255/Wyrms of the North: Thalagyrt}}

==Effects==
For the duration of the spell, any time the caster raked, slashed or grabbed a creature with their claws the ''mistclaw'' appeared and duplicated their actions. It appeared as the same size as the caster's claw but was completely weightless, and could be guided by the will of the caster.

The ''mistclaw'' remained in effect for just over half a minute. It moved harmlessly through most obstacles but could be harmed by [[weapon]]s and [[magic]]. It was particularly susceptible to attacks made by [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] weapons.

==Casting==
This spell could only be cast by [[dragon]]s, or other [[spellcaster]]s that successfully assumed a dragon's form, while in the presence of visible mist, fog or steam. While these substances were not considered a [[material component]] of the spell, as it typically only required only a [[Verbal component|verbal]] incantation, they were considered to be a catalyst that allowed the ''mistclaw'' to be evoked.

When this spell was cast by [[human]] [[wizard]]s a material component was used, often in the form of a dragon scale or talon.

==Notable Casters==
Both [[Cardatha]] of [[Silverymoon]] and [[Baerdrunsun]] of [[Alagh√¥n]] have been witnessed casting ''mistclaw'' during separate [[magefair]]s during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

[[Thalagyrt]], the [[mist dragon]] of [[Port Llast]], was known to have made use of this spell.
