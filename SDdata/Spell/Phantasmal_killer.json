        "mainbody": "Phantasmal killer, originally known as Carburys killer, Typically an arcane spell, it was also used by some clerics of the derro god Diirinka and the elven goddess Sehanine Moonbow.\nThis spell reached into the victims subconscious, pulled out the most horrifying creature he or she could imagine, and attacked with it using an illusion only the victim could see clearly (the caster saw only an indistinct shape). The victim had one chance to disbelieve the illusion and be free from the nightmare (although for an early version of this spell, timely applications of remove fear or cloak of bravery could give additional chances to resist) or else the imaginary beast pursued and attacked relentlessly until the spell ended or victim died of fright. The spell also ended if the victim or the caster were rendered unconscious, the casters concentration was broken by some means, or the victim had a constitution strong enough to survive the mental onslaught and the resulting physical damage.\nFor the older versions of phantasmal killer, certain circumstances could raise or lower the chances of resisting the mind beast. If the victim was caught completely off guard against an attack, he or she was much more likely to succumb. If the victim had previously been a target of this spell and survived, he or she was less likely to believe the illusion again. If the target was an illusionist, then the chances of disbelief were even greater. And finally, if the target was wearing a helm of telepathy they were much more likely to shrug off the attack and could even turn the tables on the caster, forcing the attacker to defend against his or her worst nightmare creature or die.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.\nThis spell was invented by the Netherese arcanist Carbury in &ndash903 DR (2956 NR, during Netherils Age of Discovery). It was known as Carburys killer and belonged to the schools of both inventive and mentalism magic."
