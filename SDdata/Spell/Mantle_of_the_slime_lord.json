        "mainbody": "'''''Mantle of the slime lord''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that coated the caster in a glossy layer of protective energy that resembled viscous, grimy water.",
        "Effects": "While the caster was protected by this gelatinous coating, they were immune to [[poison]]; any spells or spell-like effects that left them ''[[paralyze]]d'', ''[[stun]]ned'', or ''[[polymorph]]ed''; or those that could otherwise put the caster to ''[[sleep]]''. They also became well-protected from physical attacks that were normally quite deadly. \n\nLastly, for the duration of the spell, the caster was completely ignored by any non-intelligent [[ooze]]s such as [[mustard jelly|mustard jellies]] or [[gelatinous cube]]s. \n\nThis protective layer of slime did not effect the caster's movements or otherwise hinder their actions. It lasted for a matter of hours, depending on the skill and power of the caster.",
        "Casting": "This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast, as well as the use of a ''[[divine focus]]''.",
        "Usage": "This spell was only available to initiates of the [[drow]] [[Dark Seldarine|deity]] [[Ghaunadaur]]."
