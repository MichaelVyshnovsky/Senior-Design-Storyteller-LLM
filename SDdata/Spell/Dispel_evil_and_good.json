        "mainbody": "Dispel evil and good was an abjuration spell that granted protection from fey, undead, and monsters from beyond the Prime Material Plane.\nFor a minute, the caster was covered in shimmering light that created a disadvantage for attacking celestial, elemental, fey, and fiend creatures targeting the caster. \nThe caster could use the spell to break enchantment and lose the spell but touching a creature that was charmed, frightened or possessed by a creature that the spell defended against made the target lose those conditions.\nThe caster could also use the spell to use dismissal on a creature that the spell defended against. This would attempt to send the creature back to its plane of origin (unless it was already there). Undead and fey who were not on their home planes were sent to the Shadowfell and the Feywild, respectively. The spell would then be lost.\nDispel evil and good was the only spell capable of freeing a spirit trapped in a ghost lantern.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required holy water or powdered silver and iron."
