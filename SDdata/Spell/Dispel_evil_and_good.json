        "mainbody": "'''''Dispel evil and good''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that granted protection from [[fey]], [[undead]], and monsters from beyond the [[Prime Material Plane]].",
        "Effects": "For a minute, the caster was covered in shimmering light that created a disadvantage for attacking [[celestial]], [[elemental]], [[fey]], and [[fiend]] creatures targeting the caster. \n\nThe caster could use the spell to ''[[break enchantment]]'' and lose the spell but touching a creature that was charmed, frightened or possessed by a creature that the spell defended against made the target lose those conditions.\n\nThe caster could also use the spell to use ''[[dismissal]]'' on a creature that the spell defended against. This would attempt to send the creature back to its plane of origin (unless it was already there). Undead and fey who were not on their home planes were sent to the [[Shadowfell]] and the [[Feywild]], respectively. The spell would then be lost.\n\n''Dispel evil and good'' was the only spell capable of freeing a spirit trapped in a ''[[ghost lantern]]''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required [[holy water]] or powdered [[silver]] and [[iron]]."
