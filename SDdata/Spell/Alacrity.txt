Alacrity was an alteration spell used by wizards.
This spell allowed the caster to increase the speed at which they cast spells of intermediate, or lower, ability.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a miniature hourglass to cast. The hourglass was destroyed during the casting.
