Shadow sword was a divine illusion spell used by priests devoted to Shaundakul, enabling them to create and wield a sword made from shadow.
This spell created a shadow sword that was physically wielded by the caster. The shape and size of the sword could resemble any sword type the caster was familiar with. The shadow sword made it easier to strike and harm targets. These bonuses were doubled when facing ogres, trolls, goblinoids, giants, and giantkin. The shadow sword was most effective when used against undead. The spell would end if the caster released the shadow sword, or when the sword entered an area of complete darkness. The sword would vanish if a light or continual light spell were cast upon it.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the casters holy symbol and a gauntlet to cast.
