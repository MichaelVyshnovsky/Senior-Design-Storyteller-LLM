'''''Conjure animals''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that summoned [[fey]] spirits that took the shape of animals.
==Effect==
The beast or beasts that were formed were considered fey and the caster could decide how the fey spirits' power would be divided. This power would usually be divided over one powerful creature, two half as powerful, three less powerful, or four weaker creatures, but if used with a higher spell level then the number of creatures would double or even triple. They also considered the caster and her allies companions and followed the commands of the caster.

The beast or beasts would last for a hour or until they "died" from their wounds or otherwise.

==Components==
Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were needed for this spell.

==History==
The [[Arcane magic|arcane]] version of this spell was developed by the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Lucke]] in {{YearlinkConvert|2095|NY}}, and was originally called '''''Lucke's animal conjuration'''''.<ref name="neom-w-p23,27>

It was recorded in ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy text of the [[church of Mielikki]].<ref>

In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''conjure animals'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}
