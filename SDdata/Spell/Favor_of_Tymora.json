        "mainbody": "'''''Favor of Tymora''''', known also as '''''Tymora's smile''''', was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Tymora]], enabling them to confer a protection on a single target.",
        "Effects": "Once cast, the ''favor of Tymora'' could not be dispelled and would last until the target's death or the spell's energy had been expended. This spell would cancel the ''[[bane of Beshaba]]'' spell. The protection offered from this spell made it easier for the target to resist the effects of spells, [[magic item]]s, poisons, etc. That resistance became slightly weaker with each use, slowly draining the spell's magic until none remained. This spell could not be used on the same target more than once per day.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast."
