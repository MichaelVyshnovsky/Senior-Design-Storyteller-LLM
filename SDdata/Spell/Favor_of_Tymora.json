        "mainbody": "Favor of Tymora, known also as Tymoras smile, was a divine abjuration spell used by priests devoted to Tymora, enabling them to confer a protection on a single target.\nOnce cast, the favor of Tymora could not be dispelled and would last until the targets death or the spells energy had been expended. This spell would cancel the bane of Beshaba spell. The protection offered from this spell made it easier for the target to resist the effects of spells, magic items, poisons, etc. That resistance became slightly weaker with each use, slowly draining the spells magic until none remained. This spell could not be used on the same target more than once per day.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
