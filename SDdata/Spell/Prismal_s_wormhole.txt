'''''Prismal's wormhole''''' was a very rare [[arcane]] [[spell]] that allowed communication, and possibly travel, between two locations where the caster and the spell's subjects were located.

==Effects==
''Prismal's wormhole'' allowed the "caller" – the spell's subject, to summon a wormhole that was not limited by planes or distance. The only limit for the spell was imposed by the [[Domains of Dread]], in which case, the spell allowed travel only one way – into the Domains.

The wormhole that appeared on the caller's side was an illusory man-sized figure of stained glass that appeared harmless and could not cause harm. It only ever says two lines: "Please wait for the [[wizard]]," and "Sorry, the wizard is busy and chooses not to appear." On the caster's side, the illusion appeared as two objects: a stained glass humanoid and a door knocker. The stained glass illusion could take on the appearance of the caller if the caster willed it to.

If the caster refused to accept the caller's summoning, the wormhole collapsed, exhausting one of the spell's activations. If the caster wanted to be transported to the caller, all they needed to do it touch the door knocker and turn it again on the other end to return. The caster could also use the knocker on their end to open a ''[[gate]]'', allowing the caller to pass through the wormhole to the caster. No one could pass through the wormhole but the caster or the caller unless they were accompanied by the caster themselves.

The wormhole could only remain open for one minute per arcane mastery level, staying open longer as the caster grew in power. While the wormhole was open, the caster could cast any spell, except for ''[[dispel magic]]'' through it. Each casting allowed for the number of wormhole activations equal to the caster's magic mastery.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s to be cast, and the process of casting took two hours. ''Prismal's wormhole's'' material components included several [[pine]] planks, a [[brass]] door knocker, and a pint of red, blue, and yellow pigment or dye each. The planks were laid on the ground forming a door frame, the knocker was placed where the door's knocker would be, and lastly, the pigments were sprinkled on the object as the casting commenced as the secret word that activated the spell was woven into the verbal casting process.

In order for the mage to cast the spell, they had to remain in seclusion, as the preparation required absolute concentration and complete silence. Without that, the casting had a coin toss of a chance to fail.

After being cast, the spell was activated by the subject uttering a secret word given to them by the caster. Most common secret word was the caster's name.

==History==
''Prismal's wormhole'' spell was a creation of the mysterious undying mage of [[Ravens Bluff]] named [[Prismal the Outrageous]]. It was developed sometime before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was recorded in ''[[Prismal's Pocket Library, Vol.IX]]''{{Cite polyhedron/63/Chemcheaux|26}} until the shop's destruction in the late 14{{th}} century DR.{{Cite polyhedron/105/The Ravens Bluff Trumpeter|32}}

At some point, one of Prismal's ''[[spellbook]]s'' that contained the spell left [[Toril]]. A copy of the spell found its way into the ''spellbook'' called ''[[Khahkht's Book of Jokes]]'' on the world of [[Nehwon]].
