'''''Divine investiture''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[enchantment]] and [[illusion]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Siamorphe]] called [[Highborn]]s during important noble ceremonies.

==Effects==
This spell was used on newborn noble heirs, during coronations, or upon receipt of a noble title as determined by the ''[[divine bloodline]]'' spell. The target was bathed in radiant light the color of which was selected by the caster. Pageantry illusions appeared that were appropriate for the event. The recipient received the legacy of Siamorphe which varied from person to person, but usually granted a small permanent boon to the recipient.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]]s a chalice of [[holy water]] and [[dye]] laced with [[gold]] flakes to cast. The dye was used to trace the target's heraldry upon their body before the spell was cast. The holy water was poured over the dye during the casting, making it vanish.
