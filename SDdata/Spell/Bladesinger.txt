Bladesingers were elven wizards who practiced the sacred art of bladesinging, an ancient and sacred tradition of fighting that blended swordsmanship, along with other fighting styles, and unique arcane magic. These individuals were revered by their fellow elves as personifications of the perfect balance between skilled artistry and devotion to the guardianship of their people.

While bladesinging has traditionally been tied to the use of a longsword, different techniques utilizing a variety of weapons have developed throughout the years. Each type of weapon was associated with an animal group, with more specific weapons linked to species of that animal.
* Cat Practitioners of this family of bladesinging wielded swords in battle. The oldest tradition was the "lion style", which was practiced with the longsword but held no preference for a particular school of magic. Those who studied in the "leopard style" preferred short swords and illusion or stealth-oriented spells, while the "red tiger style" bladesingers wielded scimitars in movements that alternated between whirls and lunges.
* Bird While these newer styles were quite different from one another, they each made use of a weapon with a handled shaft. The "eagle style" focused on fluidity in combat, involving a pair of small handaxes whereas bladesingers of the "raven style" made use of a pick and spells that made them more dexterous.
* Snake Another of the older style families, each of its styles utilized a weapon whose shape would change in combat, such as a flail or chain. For example, practitioners of the "viper style" employed the use of whips in their bladesinging, along with particularly wicked spells that made use of poison and disease.
In addition to their skill with a weapon and inherent spellcasting powers, bladesingers gained access to a number of unique spells. Among these spells were dancing fire, dazzling sunray, frost bite, lightning ring, shadow sever, unseen hand, dimension switch, force volley, and black fire.
Some of the most powerful bladesingers could let chain the effects of their spells as they reached the crescendo of battle.
As was the case with other wizards, bladesingers still kept a spellbook within which they inscribed their spells for the day.
Unlike other spellcasters they could use their primary weapon, typically a one-handed blade, as their implement.
