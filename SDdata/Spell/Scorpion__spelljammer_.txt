The '''scorpion''' was a deadly [[spelljammer]] originally constructed and operated by [[orc]]s. These solid ships represented the pinnacle of orcish spacefaring technology before they were almost completely wiped out by [[elf|elven]] fleets

==Description==
In addition to its ranged weaponry of one [[ballista]] and two [[catapult]]s, the scorpion's main weapons were its ram-claws. Unique to this ship design, ram-claws were operated directly by the ship's captain and the second in command via a series of levers set in front of the [[spelljamming helm]]. When attacking another ship at close range, it was possible for the ram-claw to grab it and strike at it multiple times, dealing devastating damage to the ship's hull and any creature caught in the claw's grasp.

Construction, maintenance, and repair of ram-claws was expensive and required large amounts of metal. Some attempts were made to attach ram-claws to other ship types, with only limited success.

A crew of 24 individuals was sufficient to operate a scorpion at full efficiency, including all its armaments. The ship's [[air envelope]] was capable of supporting a maximum compliment of 60 occupants without becoming compromised.

Typically, less than half of all scorpions were powered by [[minor helm]]s. When crewed by orcs, the helm would be occupied by an orc [[shaman]] or a hired [[human]] [[mage]]. More frequently, these ships were powered by multiple [[lifejammer]]s that fed on the life force of their captives.

==History==
Once a common sight in space, scorpion ships were essentially exterminated by the elven fleets during the [[First Unhuman War]] and shortly thereafter. Together with the [[kobold]] [[angelship]]s, the [[goblin]]-made [[porcupine (spelljammer)|porcupine]]s, and the [[ogre]] [[mammoth (spelljammer)|mammoth]]s, nearly half of all existing scorpions were destroyed during the first decade of the conflict and the rest was hunted down in subsequent years. Most of the few surviving scorpion ships were then disassembled or stripped down for parts, as it had become too dangerous to be caught flying any of these ships.

==Notable Scorpions==
* The [[Gauntlet (spelljammer)|''Gauntlet'']], the flagship of the [[Gauntlet (organization)|company of the same name]] that was dedicated to eradicating slavery in [[Realmspace]], acting primarily in the [[Tears of Selûne]] under the command of [[Kyriel Alathar Pellinore]] in the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Rumors & Legends==
In the years after the First Unhuman War, it was speculated that surviving orcs continued building scorpions on scattered worlds. Other races were also rumored to be capable of copying the design and built their own scorpions.
