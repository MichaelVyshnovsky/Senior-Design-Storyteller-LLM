Lefebers mark was an inventive arcanist spell of small power. It was developed by inventor Lefeber in 1725 NY (âˆ’2134 DR) during Netherils Golden Age.
Knowledge of its effect was lost in later ages, but given its name and comparable power it is possible that Lefebers mark was the Netherese name for the spell wizard mark.The contemporary name for Lefebers mark is missing in the source. Apart from the epic spells, all other listed arcanist spells are from the Players Handbook 2nd edition. Wizard mark is the only spell unaccounted for where the name Lefebers mark would fit. However, wizard mark is listed separately and given more Fields of Mythal in Netheril Empire of Magic.
