'''''Lefeber's mark''''' was an [[inventive]] [[arcanist]] spell of small power. It was developed by [[inventor]] [[Lefeber]] in [[-2134 DR|1725 NY (âˆ’2134 DR)]] during [[Netheril]]'s [[Golden Age of Netheril|Golden Age]].<ref>

Knowledge of its effect was lost in later ages, but given its name and comparable power it is possible that ''Lefeber's mark'' was the Netherese name for the spell ''[[wizard mark]]''.<ref group="note">The contemporary name for ''Lefeber's mark'' is missing in the source. Apart from the epic spells, all other listed [[arcanist]] spells are from the ''[[Player's Handbook 2nd edition]]''. ''[[Wizard mark]]'' is the only spell unaccounted for where the name ''Lefeber's mark'' would fit. However, ''wizard mark'' is listed separately and given more [[Fields of Mythal]] in ''[[Netheril: Empire of Magic]]''.
