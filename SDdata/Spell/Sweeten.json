        "mainbody": "Sweeten was a useful cantrip that acolyte wizards could learn. It summoned a sprinkling of sugar or a drizzle of honey or syrup above a target creature or object.\nThis cantrip created a small quantity of a sweet-tasting condiment such as sugar, honey, or syrup. It appeared just above the target and fell as a fine powder or as a slow trickle of liquid. The amount was typically enough to sweeten food or drink for about six people.The original description of this cantrip in Dragon #59 put this at a dozen people. It was changed to \"half-dozen\" in Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four. The target of this spell had to be within  of the caster.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster made a buzzing sound while pantomiming stirring."
