It appeared just above the target and fell as a fine powder or as a slow trickle of liquid. The amount was typically enough to sweeten food or drink for about six people.The original description of this cantrip in [[Dragon magazine 59|''Dragon'' #59]] put this at a dozen people. It was changed to \"half-dozen\" in ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. The target of this spell had to be within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster made a buzzing sound while pantomiming stirring."
