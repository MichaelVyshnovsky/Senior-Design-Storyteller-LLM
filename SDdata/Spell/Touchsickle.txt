'''''Touchsickle''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to [[druid]]s, [[specialty priest]]s, and allies of [[Eldath]], the Green Goddess. It transformed the caster's hand into a magical [[sickle]].

==Effects==
Similar to ''[[flame blade]]'' and ''[[ice blade]]'', this spell caused one of the caster's hands to become a magical weapon. For six minutes (longer for more experienced casters), the chosen hand was transformed into a magically sharp wooden [[sickle]] that, for comparison purposes, was equivalent to a ''+2'' weapon. ''Touchsickle'' did not improve combat skill by any means, but the merest touch of this implement caused a wound identical to being slashed by a non-magical sickle.

==Components==
Only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were required to cast this spell.

==Users==
Peacemen and peacewomen of Eldath could only use this spell for non-aggressive purposes or self-defense. For druids, the ''touchsickle'' was equivalent to a [[gold]]en or [[silver]] sickle for the purpose of harvesting mistletoe at its greatest potency.
