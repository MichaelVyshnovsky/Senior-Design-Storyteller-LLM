        "Description": "Dragonships were the result of experimentation of the [[Shou]] with space travel. As such, they were very similar to sailing ships and were difficult to use in space. Their decks were shrines to the crew's deities and ancestors and to the Emperor. The [[spelljamming helm]] was located under a dome below decks.\n\nEvery ship was outfitted with a shrine dedicated to its crew's personal deities and ancestors, as well as the emperor of Shou Lung and [[the Path and the Way]].<ref>",
        "History": "Space-exploration missions departing from Shou Lung were a well-guarded secret. Approximately only 1 in 10,000 inhabitants even knew about the existence of those ships. The size of the fleet and the nature of the missions were meant to be known only by the emperor.\n\nDragonships in service of the emperor were tasked with exploring space, meeting new races and bringing back exotic findings. By the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], interest in space travel had somewhat diminished due to political fluctuations in the imperial court.\n\nDragonships also patrolled the spelljamming port of [[Chunming]], looking for and hunting down any spelljammer crews that broke local laws.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was said that the ultimate objective of Shou Lung's ventures into space was to make the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] truly celestial.",
