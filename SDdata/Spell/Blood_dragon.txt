'''''Blood dragon''''', also known as the '''''Bane of the Purebloods''''', was an elven spell oft used as a doomed elven mage's revenge.<ref name=DA97-p92/>

==Effects==
When cast by a pure-blooded [[elf]], the spell consumed their life first, and then caused an eruption of smoke-like corrosive venom to rise from where their veins were touched by a dragon's tooth during casting. The force turned into a red, dragon-like [[construct]], wingless and dripping gore from its jaws, which attacked a being designated as the spell was cast.<ref name=DA97-p92/>

The creature began its attack as soon as the caster finally died, pursuing its target over solid or liquid surfaces and striking with vicious force, but decaying over the next six minutes. Its attack sheared away many magical defenses progressively and quite effectively; if the target had any amount of the caster's blood on itself, then no magical barriers would apply against the dragon's attack.<ref name=DA97-p92/>

The force's attack withered the flesh of its target into a gray, rotting mass. It was possible to stop the dragon through damage, but the creature defended itself quite well.<ref name=DA97-p92/>

==Components==
Besides [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell consumed the caster's life, and required at least one object made of [[dragon]] teeth to touch the caster's blood during casting.<ref name=DA97-p92/>

==History==
[[Ildilyntra Starym]] employed this spell against the [[Coronal]] of [[Cormanthyr]], [[Eltargrim Irithyl]], in the {{yearlinkName|241}}, in an attempt to prevent the Opening of [[Cormanthor]].{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|12-14|Prologue}}
