Blood dragon, also known as the Bane of the Purebloods, was an elven spell oft used as a doomed elven mages revenge.
When cast by a pure-blooded elf, the spell consumed their life first, and then caused an eruption of smoke-like corrosive venom to rise from where their veins were touched by a dragons tooth during casting. The force turned into a red, dragon-like construct, wingless and dripping gore from its jaws, which attacked a being designated as the spell was cast.
The creature began its attack as soon as the caster finally died, pursuing its target over solid or liquid surfaces and striking with vicious force, but decaying over the next six minutes. Its attack sheared away many magical defenses progressively and quite effectively if the target had any amount of the casters blood on itself, then no magical barriers would apply against the dragons attack.
The forces attack withered the flesh of its target into a gray, rotting mass. It was possible to stop the dragon through damage, but the creature defended itself quite well.
Besides verbal and somatic components, this spell consumed the casters life, and required at least one object made of dragon teeth to touch the casters blood during casting.
Ildilyntra Starym employed this spell against the Coronal of Cormanthyr, Eltargrim Irithyl, in the , in an attempt to prevent the Opening of Cormanthor.
