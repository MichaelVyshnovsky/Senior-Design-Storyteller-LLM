Protection from all undead, 5 radius was a spell used by the Red Wizards of Thay
This spell created a protected area against all types of undead. Undead were unable to get within 5 feet (1.5 meters) of the recipient. This protective area moved with the caster. It did not protect the caster from items thrown at them by an undead, magical attacks or ranged weapons.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, dust from a vampires casket.
