        "mainbody": "'''''Seven eyes''''' was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that spawned seven eyes above the caster's head.",
        "Effects": "Each eye conjured by the caster had a specific defensive and offensive aspect. When either was expended, the eye no longer functioned. The seven eyes were known as ''eye of the mind'', ''eye of the sword'', ''eye of the mage'', ''eye of venom'', ''eye of the spirit'', ''eye of fortitude'', and ''eye of stone''.\n\n''Eye of the mind'' protected the wizard from mind-based attacks, such as ''[[charm]]''. Its offensive ability was ''[[charm person]]''. ''Eye of the sword'' protected the caster from the first physical attack that hit them. Its offensive ability was to cast ''[[magic missile]]''. ''Eye of the mage'' absorbed a single instance of [[fire]]-, cold-, electrical-, or [[acid]]-based damage. Its offensive ability was to cast ''[[lightning bolt]]''. ''Eye of venom'' stopped any [[poison]]-based attack that would affect the wizard. The offensive ability was to inflict high poison damage on a single creature for half a minute. ''Eye of the spirit'' blocked any ability that would cause instant death, such as ''[[power word, kill]]''. The offensive ability was to cast ''[[ray of enfeeblement]]''. ''Eye of fortitude'' stopped the caster from being stunned, silenced, deafened, or blinded. Its offensive ability was to cast ''[[shout]]''. ''Eye of stone'' stopped the wizard from becoming petrified. Its offensive ability was to cast ''[[hold person]]''.\n\nBefore being cast again, all the eyes had to be expended."
