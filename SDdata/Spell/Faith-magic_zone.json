        "mainbody": "Faith-magic zone, or faith magic zone, was a divine abjuration spell that caused any non-divine magic to be less effective within a given area.\nThe zone was not visible to any person or creature within the area of its casting. Only a small, silver radiance emanated from priests upon the spells casting.\nWhen cast, this spell created a sphere, 180 feet (58.9 meters) in diameter that slowed down any spells that were cast by wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, or other non-divine spellcasters. In addition, any magical items that drew upon arcane or other non-clerical spells functioned with less effectiveness.\nAny people or creatures within the zone that were targeted by arcane spells or similar abilities gained significant protection against these types of magic.\nThe zone lasted for a few minutes and could be readily dispelled.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the holy symbol of the cleric casting it, as well as a vial of honey that had been collected from a honeycomb.\nThis spell was relatively well-known among the druids and other members of the Emerald Enclave."
