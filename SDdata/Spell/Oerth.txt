==Cosmography==
Greyspace was part of a celestial configuration known as the Triad, which also included [[Realmspace]], where the world of [[Toril]] was found, and [[Krynnspace]], home of the world of [[Krynn]]. The [[phlogiston]], a rainbow-colored chaotic liquid that surrounded the spheres, had strong currents flowing from Grayspace toward Krynnspace, from Krynnspace toward Realmspace, and in both directions between Greyspace and Realmspace. Traveling with any of these currents was a relatively simple matter, but traveling directly from Krynnspace to Greyspace or from Realmspace to Krynnspace was impossible.<ref>

==Geography==
There was a land here called the Flanaess and a body of water called the Coral Sea.<ref>

===Calendar===
Similarly to Toril, the inhabitants of Oerth used a number of different calendars to mark the time. The standard most commonly used was the Common Year (CY) calendar. A year on Oerth lasted 365 [[wikipedia:sidereal day|sidereal days]], but as a result of the sun's orbit around the planet, a calendar year contained only 364 [[wikipedia:solar day|solar days]].{{Cite dragon/123/Just Making Time}}<ref group="note">This difference in the number of days of the Oerthian year is due to the fact that the sun orbits Oerth in the same direction as the planet's rotation around its own axis. For that reason, every 365 times Oerth completes a full rotation around itself, the sun completes one, subtracting a day, for a total of 364 calendar days.

The {{YearlinkName|1360}} marked the first meeting between [[Elminster]] and [[Mordenkainen]] on [[Earth]].{{Cite dragon/185/Magic in the Evening|62}}{{Cite dragon/196/Novel Ideas|66}} On Oerth, this was shortly before the year 581 CY, when Mordenkainen was beginning to suspect a plot to destroy the Circle of Eight, which culminated in [[Vecna]]'s first failed attempt at becoming a [[greater deity]].{{Oerth-time}}

==History==
In the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Jewely Carseah]] and [[Marcus of the Waters]] were sent as emissaries from Oerth to the [[Rock of Bral]] to discuss the threat of invasion the [[Vodoni Empire]] posed to the [[crystal sphere]]s of [[Realmspace]], Greyspace, and [[Krynnspace]], in the early stages of the [[War of the Spheres]]. The meeting marked the formation of the [[Free Space Alliance]].

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a book on the history of Oerth was part of the collection of the [[arcanaloth]] headmaster of the [[Dweomercore]] level of [[Undermountain]].

==Inhabitants==

Oerth was home to prominent wizards such as [[Bigby]], [[Drawmij]], [[Tenser]], and Mordenkainen, whose spells were well known on [[Toril]]. Mordenkainen was an acquaintance of Elminster's; the two had met on numerous occasions in the home of [[Ed Greenwood|Ed of the Green Wood]] on [[Earth]] to exchange spells and lore.{{Cite dragon/185/Magic in the Evening|56}}<ref group="note">See other articles in [[the Wizards Three]] series in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]]''. Mordenkainen, when he had newly mastered interplanar travel, used to visit [[Waterdeep]] with some regularity.<ref>{{Cite dragon/211/The Wizards Three: A Night of Shadows|84}}

When [[Harkle Harpell]] entered into an unorthodox contest of wizardry with the ''[[Sea Sprite]]'s'' wizard [[Robillard]], Harkle and Robillard mentioned a number of Oerthly wizards, including Bigby, Melf, Otiluke, and Tenser. In particular, Robillard regarded Bigby as one of the most powerful and impressive wizards of all time, on any world.<ref>

The Oerthly [[bard]] Gwydiesin of the Cranes also chatted with Elminster on occasion.<ref>

Both Elminster and [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] spent time on Oerth, and Elminster suspected that [[Khelben Arunsun the Younger]] settled there to begin a life away from the elder Khelben.

Oerth was the homeworld of [[Scaldulin]], a famous hero who wielded a powerful [[enchanted]] [[sword]], the ''[[Hoarfrost Blade]]''. Before the blade ended up broken and then reforged on Toril, the sword accompanied its owner in the [[Battle of the Thousand Dead]], battle against [[lich]] [[Scaroth]] the Warped of [[Blackmoor]], and stayed with its master after his transformation into a [[death knight]]. The sword also cut down a [[solar]] named [[Arazium]].

==Culture==
Large green plover's eggs were a delicacy in the Flanaess.
