        "mainbody": "Anti-magic aura was an elven abjuration spell that prevented a single individual from casting any spells, accessing any spell-like abilities and rendered any magical items on their person inert for a short duration of time.\nWhen this spell was cast, the anti-magic aura appeared around the profile of the affected individual in the form of glittering light. While the aura was active, they could not cast any arcane or divine spells and had no access to any magical energy or powers, such as inherent spell-like abilities. Furthermore, any weapons they held were temporarily stripped of their enhancements and functioned as non-magical versions of their basic weapon type.\nThe duration of the anti-magi aura lasted for just over a minute, but could continue on longer, depending on the power and experience of the caster. The aura could be successfully dispelled by any unaffected spellcaster.\nAnti-magic aura functioned in a similar manner to the  spell anti-magic shell but was meant for offensive use, to neutralize any hostile spellcasters.\nThis spell was unique to the elves of Evermeet. The specifications of its casting was a well-guarded secret by the Tel-quessir of that realm.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to be cast."
