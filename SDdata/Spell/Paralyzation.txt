Paralyzation was an arcane illusion spell that created the illusion of muscle slowness in targets.
This spell would not function if used upon mindless creatures. The spell affected the weakest targets first within a  cube, becoming paralyzed for an hour if they were unable to resist the spell.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
This spell was found within Selvars Ineffable Conjurations, Magicks, and Phantasms.
