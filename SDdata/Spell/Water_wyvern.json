        "mainbody": "Water wyvern was a divine conjuration spell from the elemental water sphere that animated water as the caster desired.\nThe wyvern-like mass of water was twice the casters body volume. It could \"bite\" during combat with crushing water and could even be ridden like a mount by the caster.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components an animal tooth and three scales from an aquatic creature to cast.\nWater wyvern was granted to priests of Umberlee, the Bitch Queen."
