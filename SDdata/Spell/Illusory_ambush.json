        "mainbody": "'''''Illusory ambush''''' is an [[illusion]] [[spell]] similar to a simplified and easier to master version of the ''[[phanstasmal killer]]'' spell. ''Illusory ambush'' is learned by [[wizard]]s, particularly those who wish to become illusionists. When cast, ''illusory ambush'' manifests a small number of illusory assailants at a location within fifty feet of the wizard, who seem to attack an intended target, distracting him or her from their own assault against the wizard. So realistic is this illusion that those who fail to see through it are actually injured in the process of fighting off the phantasmal attackers. The illusion does not last long but can be recast at any time.",
