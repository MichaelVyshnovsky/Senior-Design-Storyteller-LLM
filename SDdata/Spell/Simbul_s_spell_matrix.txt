The Simbuls spell matrix was a transmutation spell used by wizards and sorcerers.
With this spell the caster prepared an arcane matrix capable of storing several spells that could be cast without using spells from the casters memory. The caster simply cast the desired spells in order immediately after casting the spell matrix. Up to four spells could be used in this manner.
Utilizing the Simbuls spell matrix was not without its price as each spell cast into the matrix harmed the caster. The caster could not be healed by any means from these injuries while the matrix was active. Each spell within the matrix could only be cast once before it was removed.
The matrix, along with all of the stored spells, could be negated with a dispel magic spell. The spells in the matrix would not function if the caster stood with an anti-magic field.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a piece of amber worth at least 500 gp to cast.
