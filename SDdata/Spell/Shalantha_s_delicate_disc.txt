'''''Shalantha's delicate disc''''' was a [[conjuration]] spell that caused a small disk to appear that looked like it was made of [[rose]]-colored [[egg]]shell. A second spell was then cast which the disk absorbed. This spell was released if the disk was ever broken.

==History==
It was presumably developed by [[Shalantha]].
