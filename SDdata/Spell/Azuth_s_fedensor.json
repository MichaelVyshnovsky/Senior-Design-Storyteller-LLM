        "mainbody": "Azuths fedensor was a divine alteration spell used by specialty priests devoted to Azuth, enabling them to cast subsequent spells without the need for any material components.\nOnce this spell was cast the caster, or someone touched by the caster, could cast their next spell without the need for material spell components assuming the material component was not a target of the spells effects such as the gem used in magic jar. The subsequent spell needed to be cast within ten minutes of the fedensor or it would not work.\nAdditionally, Azuths fedensor allowed the caster to retain the subsequent spell within their memory to be used again without the need to rememorize the spell.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
