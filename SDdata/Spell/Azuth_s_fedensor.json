        "mainbody": "'''''Azuth's fedensor''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Azuth]], enabling them to cast subsequent spells without the need for any [[material component]]s.",
        "Effects": "Once this spell was cast the caster, or someone touched by the caster, could cast their next spell without the need for material spell components assuming the material component was not a target of the spell's effects such as the [[gem]] used in ''[[magic jar]]''. The subsequent spell needed to be cast within ten minutes of the ''fedensor'' or it would not work.\n\nAdditionally, ''Azuth's fedensor'' allowed the caster to retain the subsequent spell within their memory to be used again without the need to rememorize the spell.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast."
