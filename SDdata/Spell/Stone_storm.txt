'''''Stone storm''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Moradin]].
 
==Effects==
When cast, this spell unleashed a swirling vortex of dust and stone. The vortex covered an area with a {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} radius, with a calm center {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in width. The caster could also cast the spell as a cloud, with a total dimension of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}. Creatures within the vortex suffered damage from the flying stones and abrasive dust.

'''''Stone quench''''' was the reverse of ''stone storm''. It was used to not only reverse the effects of ''stone storm'', but could also be used to clear an area of choking dust. If used on a creature from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]], the spell could return them to their home plane.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Moradin as well as a handful of pebbles or dust that was tossed into the air during casting.
