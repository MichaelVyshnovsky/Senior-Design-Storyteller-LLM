'''''Circle of death''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that extinguished the life force of several living creatures in all directions.<ref>{{Cite web/Spell index}} Originally, this spell was simply called '''''death spell''''',

==Effects==
The old ''death spell'' version slew creatures outright making it impossible for them to return except via a ''[[wish]]'' spell. This version killed creatures in a 30-foot-wide (9.1 meters) cube or bigger, depending on the caster's level. 

[[Negative energy]], appearing as light that is somehow dark, radiated out in a burst as directed by the caster. All touched by this energy could have their life force snuffed out.

The postâ€“[[Second Sundering]] version created a 60-foot-radius (18 meters) ball of negative energy centered within a 150 foot (46 meters) range. Every creature in the sphere had a chance to resist the necrotic energies or they suffered serious damage. If cast at higher levels, the spell did even more damage.

This spell had no effect on the [[undead]], [[lycanthropes]], or creatures from [[plane]]s other than the [[Prime Material Plane]].

==Components==
The [[somatic component]] of this spell required the caster to point a finger at the intended targets and toss powdered black pearl dust as a [[material component]] into the air in front of his or her lips. The [[verbal component]] was echoing and awe-inspiring. The powdered black [[pearl]] had to be worth at least 500 [[gold piece]]s. Older versions of this spell needed powdered black pearl worth at least 1,000 gold pieces.

==History==
The [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Dethed]] was given credit for the creation of this spell in {{Yearlink|-1881}}. It was originally known as ''Dethed's spell''.<ref> ''Circle of death'' was a common spell in the Realms. 

The [[Zhentarim]] mageling [[Fimril]] attempted to use a slaying spell that required powdered black pearl as its material component to slay [[Mirt]] and the moneylender's companions in the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, at [[Tethgard]]. The spell instead slew Fimril; the spell was almost certainly a ''death spell''.{{cite book/Crown of Fire/TPB 2002|109|6}}
