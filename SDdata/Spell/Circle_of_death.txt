Circle of death was a necromancy spell that extinguished the life force of several living creatures in all directions. Originally, this spell was simply called death spell,
The old death spell version slew creatures outright making it impossible for them to return except via a wish spell. This version killed creatures in a 30-foot-wide (9.1 meters) cube or bigger, depending on the casters level. 
Negative energy, appearing as light that is somehow dark, radiated out in a burst as directed by the caster. All touched by this energy could have their life force snuffed out.
The postâ€“Second Sundering version created a 60-foot-radius (18 meters) ball of negative energy centered within a 150 foot (46 meters) range. Every creature in the sphere had a chance to resist the necrotic energies or they suffered serious damage. If cast at higher levels, the spell did even more damage.
This spell had no effect on the undead, lycanthropes, or creatures from planes other than the Prime Material Plane.
The somatic component of this spell required the caster to point a finger at the intended targets and toss powdered black pearl dust as a material component into the air in front of his or her lips. The verbal component was echoing and awe-inspiring. The powdered black pearl had to be worth at least 500 gold pieces. Older versions of this spell needed powdered black pearl worth at least 1,000 gold pieces.
