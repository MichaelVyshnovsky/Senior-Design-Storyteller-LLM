Battle trident was an improved version of the evocation spell, speeding trident.
This spell worked similarly to speeding trident, except that the projectile twisted and streaked towards its target. For its brief existence, the battle trident functioned as if it possessed a +2 enchantment.
The name of this spell appeared on the surface of the Umberlant relic, the Orglara.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required three drops of water and three points made of ferrous metal as material components.
