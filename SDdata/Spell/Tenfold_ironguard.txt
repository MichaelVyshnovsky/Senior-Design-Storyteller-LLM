Tenfold ironguard was an improved version of the spell ironguard.
When cast, this spell made ten individuals immune to the touch of non-enchanted metal. Metal objects would pass through the recipients as if they were non-corporeal.
Tenfold ironguard was unique to others like it, in that it allowed each recipient to choose a single metal item that would not be affected by the spells effects.
The title of this spell was inscribed within the Helm of Helm and could be cast by utterance of its wearer.
This spell required verbal and somatic components, along with a small amount of iron fillings and a single drop of aqua regia.
