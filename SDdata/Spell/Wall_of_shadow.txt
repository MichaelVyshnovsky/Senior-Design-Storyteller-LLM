Wall of shadow was a divine conjuration spell used by priests devoted to Eshowdow.
This spell created a permanent wall or ring of twilight the size of which depended on the skill of the caster. The "wall" version of this spell was always oriented vertically. A wall of shadow acted like an impenetrable wall of force to anything connected to the Negative Energy plane or the Shadowfell. Any creature not connected to the Shadowfell or Negative Energy plane that passed through the wall of shadow would experience the effects of an enervation spell that lasted for several hours.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the priests holy symbol and an area of shadow to cast.
