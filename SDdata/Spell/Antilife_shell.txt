Antilife shell, also known as anti-animal shell, was an abjuration spell that produced a hemispherical barrier that was impermeable to most types of living creatures.
The area protected by this spell was a  radius hemisphere centered on the caster and lasted almost two hours at a minimum (longer for higher level casters). For the older version called anti-animal shell, the force field prevented entry of creatures that were at least partially animal. This included all humanoids, beasts, magical beasts, giants, vermin, and hybrids like cambions. The newer version added more lifeforms such as aberrations, dragons, fey, monstrous humanoids, oozes, plants, and shapechangers to this list. Creatures that were unaffected by this spell included aerial servants, imps, quasits, constructs (like golems), elementals, outsiders, or undead.
Like most abjuration spells, this one could not be used offensively to push a warded creature. Any such attempt resulted in the collapsing of the force field.
With the Second Sundering magic system lasting for a hour the caster had a  barrier to hedge living creature. The spell would end if the caster moved so that a creature would have to pass the barrier.
Both versions required verbal and somatic components, plus the holy symbol or divine focus of the caster. The older version also required a handful of peppers.
It was recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki.
