        "mainbody": "Hypnotic pattern was an illusion spell that could incapacitate multiple creatures.\nThe spellcaster created a pattern of twisting colors that lasted for just a moment. Any creature within range that could see the pattern would be paralyzed for up to one minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating. Creatures could attempt to resist to this effect or be shaken out of it.\nThe spell required somatic and material components. The required materials were either an incense stick or a crystal vial filled with some phosphorescent material.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Hamring in  and was originally called Hamrings hypnopattern."
