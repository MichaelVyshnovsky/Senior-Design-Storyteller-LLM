        "mainbody": "'''''Steelskin''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to priests of [[Flandal Steelskin]], the Master of Metal. It temporarily made the skin of a creature become melded with [[steel]], giving them added protection against weapon blows.",
        "Effects": "The caster had to touch the target of this spell in order to cast it. Once cast, ''steelskin'' lasted four minutes (longer for more experienced casters) and transformed the skin or hide of the target creature into an amalgam of flesh and steel at the cost of some dexterity and agility.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the use of the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a small rod of forged steel."
