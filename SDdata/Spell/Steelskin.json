        "mainbody": "Steelskin was a divine magic spell granted to priests of Flandal Steelskin, the Master of Metal. It temporarily made the skin of a creature become melded with steel, giving them added protection against weapon blows.\nThe caster had to touch the target of this spell in order to cast it. Once cast, steelskin lasted four minutes (longer for more experienced casters) and transformed the skin or hide of the target creature into an amalgam of flesh and steel at the cost of some dexterity and agility.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of the priests holy symbol and a small rod of forged steel."
