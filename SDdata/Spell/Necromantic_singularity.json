        "mainbody": "Necromantic singularity was a spell of epic magic.\nWhen cast, necromantic singularity created a temporary link between the Prime Material Plane, the Weave, and the Negative Energy Plane within 300 feet (91 meters) for a very short time. Through this link came negative energy in its purest form that killed living beings until it was exhausted. It started with those that were closest to the link and continued to the next nearest living creature and so on until the negative energy was completely exhausted or no lifeform was to be found within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the epicenter.\nNecromantic singularity required somatic, verbal, and material components. The material component was a sphere of annihilation that was destroyed upon casting. The spell took one minute to cast.\nNecromantic singularity was one of the most fearsome spells developed on Faer√ªn. It took twenty-two days and 1,071,000 gp to develop it."
