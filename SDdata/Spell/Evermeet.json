        "Government": {
            "Monarchy": "Prior to the [[Spellplague]], Evermeet was ruled by Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]], who resided within the capital city of [[Leuthilspar]]. The ''Sad Queen'', as Amlaruil had become known, depended heavily on her [[Council of Matrons]] for advice. Although the queen had male advisers as well, none of them formed part of her court.\n\nThe [[Queen's High Council]] on the other hand included some prominent males. It consisted of:\n*[[Zaltarish]]: The queen's personal scribe\n*High Admiral [[Emardin Elsydar]]: Master of Evermeet's navy\n*High Marshal [[Keryth Blackhelm]]\n*Lady [[Selsharra Durothil]]: Matron of [[House Durothil]]\n*Lady [[Ammisyll Veldann]]: Governor of the city of [[Nimlith]]\n*[[Grand Mage]] [[Breithel Olithir]]: Head of Evermeet's [[mage]]s\n\nWhile tradition decrees the High Council serves at the pleasure of the Elven Throne and the current reigning monarch, the members appointed to the council were just as traditionally powerful in their own right, and their opinions did not always coincide with that of the reigning king or queen.",
            "Royal Council": "As of [[1479 DR]], after the tumultuous events of the [[Spellplague]], Queen Amlaruil was gone and her reign replaced with the governance of her high council, renamed the [[Royal Council]]. They were set to rule until a suitable heir could be found."

        "Defenses": {
            "Magical and Natural": "The isle of Evermeet was protected by a battery of defenses, both naturally-occurring and magically-created by the [[Seldarine]]. The island itself was shrouded in a powerful [[illusion]], crafted by the deity [[Sehanine Moonbow]], that concealed its view from non-elven eyes. Smaller illusory spells gave the appearance of phantom keys, reefs and other nautical hazards that would ward off seafaring races.\n\nIn the [[Sea of Swords]], a series of intricately patterned water currents and benign gusts of wind, created by [[Aerdrie Faenya]], placidly turned away non-elven ships that approached the Green Isle. Beyond the redirecting weather, closer to the island, was a region of defensive storms and destructive cyclones. Massive water spouts emerged from the sea, surrounded incoming vessels, and could outright destroy them.\n\nFurther in towards the isle was a maze of reefs, sandbanks and regions of shallow water that made safe passage all-but impossible without knowledge of the route between the hazards. This path was known only to the [[sea elves]] of the region and select elven navigators and pilots.\n\nSeveral great aquatic creatures were magically persuaded to defend the Evermeet. Among the isle's known protectors were a [[kraken]], a [[leviathan (creature)|leviathan]] and a [[dragon turtle]]. [[Crustaid]]s – creatures unique to the ocean floor around Evermeet, were gargantuan creatures that served Queen Amlaruil Moonflower, following her every command, guarding the island and the mouth of River Shaelyn.{{Cite polyhedron/130/Sea Monster: Crustaid|22-23}}",
            "Navy": "The navy of the monarchy of Evermeet was known as one of the finest in all of [[Toril]]. Among the fleet were sleek and graceful [[swanship]]s, powerful [[dragonship (ship)|dragonships]] and four massive [[wardragon]]s.",

        "History": "The island was created by an [[elven high magic]] ritual around {{Yearlink|-17600}}.\n\nThe Evermeet archipelago was the main elven base during the [[First Unhuman War|First]] and [[Second Unhuman War]]s, as well as a major base for the [[Elven Imperial Fleet]] and all spacefaring elven nations.\n\nMany have tried to invade the island over the years, including the [[Red Wizards]], the [[Zhentarim]], the [[drow]] and various pirates of the [[Sword Coast]] and the [[Trackless Sea]].{{Fact}}\n\nFollowing the [[scro]] invasion of [[Realmspace]] in the {{YearlinkName|1360}} during the [[Second Unhuman War]], the spelljammer fleet of Evermeet was deployed to reinforce the [[Elven Imperial Fleet]] in their efforts to repeal the scro. After more than a dozen battles, the scro forces were finally forced to retreat from the [[crystal sphere]].{{Cite dragon annual/1996/Campaign Classics: The Scro|46}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, an invasion force led by [[Kymil Nimesin]] made it past the island's defenses and finally brought war to the elven [[retreat]]. With help from [[Lloth]], Kymil Nimesin successfully arranged for the [[Ityak-Ortheel]], a creature of [[Malar]], to be brought to the island. Lloth was also responsible for rendering all elfgates inoperable by linking them all to a single entity in a gem held by Kymil Nimesin, thereby preventing notables like [[Laeral Silverhand]] and [[Khelben Arunsun]] from rendering aid.<ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}} the Island Kingdom was assaulted by [[Daemonfey]]. These [[demon]]ic Tel'Quessir, who were imprisoned as a means of punishment for consorting with demons, raided [[Tower Reilloch]], a tower of mages in Evermeet. They sought a piece of a legendary [[artifact]] that, when made whole, had the power to release the imprisoned army of the Daemonfey. While doing so they planted a [[lore gem]] containing information that no Daemonfey could access, in an attempt to trick the Tel'Quessir into unlocking it and handing them the information. Evermeet unofficially sent an army to Faerûn under the command of [[Seiveril Miritar|Lord Seiveril Miritar]], a priest of [[Corellon Larethian]], to assist the Tel'Quessir of Evereska and the [[High Forest]] in their fight against the Daemonfey. After successfully repelling the daemonfey in Evereska, Seiveril's army pursued their foe to [[Cormanthyr]].{{Fact}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, when the [[Spellplague]] struck and ravaged across Faerûn, contact was lost with Evermeet.  All of the permanent portals ceased functioning and efforts by the other fey kingdoms on Faerûn to reestablish contact have failed, and it is largely thought that Evermeet was destroyed.  What is little known is that Evermeet was in fact transported into the Feywild and persists there.  Only an echo of the physical island, without any structures or inhabitants, remained on [[Toril]].\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the settlements of Evermeet resided primarily in the [[Feywild]], the inhabited cities having all but disappeared from the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] was gone, and a Royal Council ruled in her place.  However, the natural landscape of the island itself remains on the Prime, albeit uninhabited and with strong ties to its fey counterpart.\n\nIt did sometimes act as a crossover between the Feywild and Faerûn and could only be accessed by those who knew the secret route.{{Cite web/Heroes: Nymmestra}}\n\nWith the end of the [[Second Sundering]] in the 1480s DR, Evermeet returned to Toril, although it dwelt in a state of coexistence between the Prime, the Feywild, and [[Arvandor]]."
