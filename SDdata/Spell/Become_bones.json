        "mainbody": "Become bones was a common spell.\nWhen cast, this spell altered the body of the caster. The casters flesh, organs, and clothing became invisible, which caused them to look like a skeleton. The casters normal abilities were not altered. When the spell was in effect, undead creatures took no interest in the caster, ignoring them completely.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
