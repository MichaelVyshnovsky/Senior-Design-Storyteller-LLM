        "mainbody": "Shades of Rhondang was a divine magic spell granted to priests of Flandal Steelskin, the Pyromancer. It temporarily imbued the casters hammer with the properties of a flame tongue sword.\nThis spell could only be used on the casters own, non-magical hammer. If cast on any another weapon or tool, the spell fizzled. Likewise, the spell immediately ended if the caster lost contact with the hammer, became unconscious, died, or a dispel magic effect was successfully performed on the hammer. Because the caster had to maintain a grip on the flaming weapon, they could not cast other spells that required a somatic component or perform actions that required both hands. The effects of shades of Rhondang lasted for at least seven minutes (longer for more experienced casters). While the hammer was aflame, it had the properties of a flame tongue sword. It produced light like a torch, could ignite flammable items, and was particularly effective against cold-using creatures, regenerating creatures, avians, and the undead.\nThis spell required only verbal and material components, and the priests holy symbol to cast. The material component was the casters hammer, which was not consumed in the casting and returned to normal after the spell dissipated.\nFlandal Steelskins hammer, Rhondang, had many magical properties, and thus the name shades of Rhondang indicated that the casters hammer was granted some of these properties."
