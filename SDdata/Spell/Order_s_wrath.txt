'''''Order's wrath''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] unique to [[cleric]]s with the [[Law domain]]. It harmed and dazed creatures of chaos.

==Effect==
The caster channeled lawful power in the form of a three-dimensional grid composed of energy over a cube 30 feet (9.1 meters) on each side, up to medium range. This affect only [[chaotic]] and [[neutral]] beings, and left [[lawful]] ones unharmed. Chaotic creatures, especially chaotic [[outsider]]s, were harmed according to the power of the caster, and stunned for several seconds, if they lacked the will to resist. Neutral creatures were hurt only half as badly, and were not dazed.

==Components==
It required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
