Conjure earth elemental was a divine conjuration spell.
This spell conjured a native from the Elemental Plane of Earth to assist the caster. The reverse of this spell, dismiss earth elemental, sent the summoned creature back home.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
Conjure earth elemental fell out of use in the Year of Wild Magic, when deities started granting the more diverse planar ally spell.
