        "mainbody": "Hissing sand was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nWith this spell the caster could cause sand or loose earth to flow in a direction of their choosing. The sand hissed as it moved and could not bury creatures capable of moving out of the way. It could be used to cover tracks or bury inanimate objects. If used on a slope, this spell could start a landslide, in which case creatures below the moving earth could be buried and even killed. This spell only worked on sand or loose soil.\nThis spell required a cup of any liquid to cast."
