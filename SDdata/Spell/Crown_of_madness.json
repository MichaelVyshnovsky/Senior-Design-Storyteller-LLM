        "Effect": "Following the onset of the [[Spellplague]], ''crown of madness'' made an affected individual attack anyone adjacent to them, as the caster directed.\n\nAfter the [[Second Sundering]], ''crown of madness'' worked in mostly the same manner, but had a longer duration of up to a full minute. This iteration of the spell ended if the affected target resisted its effects or was not directed to attack someone by the caster.",
        "Components": "Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were needed to cast this spell."
