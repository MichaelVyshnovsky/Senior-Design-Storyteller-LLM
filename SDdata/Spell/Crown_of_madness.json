        "mainbody": "Crown of madness was an enchantment spell that assaulted the mind of a target and summoned a jagged crown above the targets head.\nFollowing the onset of the Spellplague, crown of madness made an affected individual attack anyone adjacent to them, as the caster directed.\nAfter the Second Sundering, crown of madness worked in mostly the same manner, but had a longer duration of up to a full minute. This iteration of the spell ended if the affected target resisted its effects or was not directed to attack someone by the caster.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were needed to cast this spell."
