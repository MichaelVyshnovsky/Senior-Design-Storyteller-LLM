Shades was an illusion spell that created semi-real duplicates of lesser conjuration spells.
The spell drew energy from the Plane of Shadow in order to create a semi-real duplicate of any conjuration spell of lesser power from the subschools of summoning or creation.
If the victim recognized the illusion, the shadow energy was a lot less effective than the duplicated spell. It was always less effective on objects, as objects were incapable of belief in the first place.
Shades was considered a more powerful version of the spells shadow conjuration and greater shadow conjuration, being capable of creating stronger illusions than both.
Shades used verbal and somatic components only.
The spell was created by Netherese arcanist Shadow in  and was originally called Shadows shades.
The spell was under common usage among the assassins of the Jaezred Chaulssin by the 14 century DR.
