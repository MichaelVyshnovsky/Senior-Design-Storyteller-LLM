'''''Shades''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that created semi-real duplicates of lesser [[conjuration]] spells.

==Effect==
The spell drew energy from the [[Plane of Shadow]] in order to create a semi-real duplicate of any conjuration spell of lesser power from the subschools of summoning or creation.

If the victim recognized the illusion, the shadow energy was a lot less effective than the duplicated spell. It was always less effective on objects, as objects were incapable of belief in the first place.

''Shades'' was considered a more powerful version of the spells ''[[shadow conjuration]]'' and ''[[greater shadow conjuration]]'', being capable of creating stronger illusions than both.

==Components==
''Shades'' used verbal and somatic components only.

==History==
The spell was created by [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Telamont Tanthul|Shadow]] in {{Yearlink|-597}} and was originally called ''Shadow's shades''.

==Notable Users==
The spell was under common usage among the [[assassin]]s of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|6}}
