        "mainbody": "Natures eyes was a divine magic spell granted to priests and other followers of Gaerdal Ironhand, the Shield of the Golden Hills. It granted the caster the ability to use the senses of all animals in their vicinity to locate intruders in the environment.\nThis spell worked only on the caster and creatures of animal intelligence within a  radius, and lasted at least two hours (more experienced casters could cover a wider area for longer periods of time). While under the influence of natures eyes, the caster could \"tune in\" to the senses of all nearby creatures and know if they were alerted to intruders. If so, the caster was also able to discern the interlopers approximate locations. This spell was not beneficial in truly barren deserts, sterile underground locations, or places infested with the undead. It was only useful if cast in an environment with enough animal life to observe the area in question. The caster was not able to determine anything more specific than the approximate location of foreign creatures, but it did make them immune to being surprised by them.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of the priests holy symbol and two acorns held in one fist."
