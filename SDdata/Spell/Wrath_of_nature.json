        "mainbody": "Wrath of nature was an evocation spell used by rangers and druids that called the spirits of nature to fight on the casters behalf.\nThe spell called forth spirits of nature to animate trees, grass, roots, vines, and rocks within the volume of a cube  on a side. The grass hindered the casters enemies movement, making it extremely taxing and difficult. The trees started whipping around, slashing any of the casters enemies that came too close with their branches. Roots and vines rose from the ground and restrained hostile creatures of the casters choice one at a time. At the casters command, rocks flew at designated targets, battering and knocking them down. This activity lasted for up to 1 minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components."
