        "mainbody": "'''''Wall of force''''' (originally called '''''Shan's forcewall'''''",
        "Effects": "The spellcaster can create a wall of force at any point within 120 feet for up to 10 minutes if concentration is maintained.  The force wall is one quarter inch thick and can be up to about 1,200 square feet. The wall can be almost any shape, only limiting any section to a minimum of 100 square feet.  Thus a caster might make a bridge or wall 10 feet wide or tall, and up to 120 feet long, or shape it into a dome or even a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet.\n\nIf the Force wall would appear where a creature is located, they are pushed out to the edge of the effect.  In the instance of someone running through the doorway as you erect a force wall in it, they would be ejected, not trapped.\n\nThe wall of force created by this spell is immune to all damage and to [[dispel magic]], but it is destroyed by the spell ''[[disintegrate]]'' and it is weak to ''[[mage's disjunction]]'' spells, [[Rod of cancellation|''rods of cancellation'']] and [[Sphere of annihilation|''spheres of annihilation'']]. The barrier is also present on the [[ethereal plane]] and blocks passage there as well.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, the caster required a pinch of powder ground from a clear gem (such as [[rusteen]]) to cast this spell, which vanished.",
        "Notable Users": "* [[Esklindrar Iol]], a sage from [[Silverymoon]]\n* [[Yashar]], a male [[medusa]] who guarded the [[Undying Temple]]",
        "History": "The spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Shan (arcanist)|Shan]] in [[-624 DR|3235 NY (âˆ’624 DR)]]&mdash;his final recorded spell.",
        "Notable Uses": "''Walls of force'' were used to block the exits to the ruins of a school of wizardry located in the [[Highbank Forest]]. They were also used in the construction of the fifth region of the [[Sevenfold Mazework]] within the [[Great Dismal Delve]] on the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] and in the architecture of the [[High Temple of Mystra]] on [[Mount Talath]] in [[Halruaa]] and the [[House of the Moon]] in [[Waterdeep]].<ref> Such walls were used in the defense of the [[House of the Loregiver]], the [[Vault of the Word of the Loregiver]], and the [[Hall of Ashes]] in [[Huzuz]], [[Zakhara]].\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], an [[avatar]] of the goddess [[Shar]] used ''wall of force'' to deflect an ''[[ice storm]]'' hurled by [[Kyriani]].{{Cite comic/Total Eclipse|20}}"
