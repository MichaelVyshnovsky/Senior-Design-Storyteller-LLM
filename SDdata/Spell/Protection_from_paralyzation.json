        "mainbody": "Protection from paralyzation was a spell used by the Red Wizards of Thay.\nThis spell protected the caster from all forms of paralysis. Muscle and nerve paralysis, including paralysis brought on by a gas, had no effect on the caster. The caster was also protected against spells such as hold person. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a piece of dried carrion crawler tentacle. During casting it was crushed then swallowed by the caster.\nThe Red Wizards of Thay were known to use this spell before the Time of Troubles. It was widely believed to have been lost to them afterwards."
