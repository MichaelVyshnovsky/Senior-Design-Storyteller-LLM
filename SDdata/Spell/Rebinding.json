        "mainbody": "'''''Rebinding''''' was the rarest and perhaps most powerful spell known to hedge wizards; it rebuilt a destroyed [[enchanted|magical item]]. Less than one in a thousand hedge mages knew this spell; it was known to some [[artificer]]s.",
        "Effects": "The spell had to be cast once upon the broken item, prior to a mundane repair. After the mundane repair, the spell was recast; if it succeeded, there was a chance that the magical item became completely restored. The most definitive sources placed the chance at roughly 50% at every turn, improving for the most drastically powerful objects.",
        "Components": "The spell called for [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components; as a material component, about 50 [[gold pieces]] worth of silver skein and two lodestones were needed."
