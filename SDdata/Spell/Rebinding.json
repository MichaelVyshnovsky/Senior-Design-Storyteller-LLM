        "mainbody": "Rebinding was the rarest and perhaps most powerful spell known to hedge wizards it rebuilt a destroyed magical item. Less than one in a thousand hedge mages knew this spell it was known to some artificers.\nThe spell had to be cast once upon the broken item, prior to a mundane repair. After the mundane repair, the spell was recast if it succeeded, there was a chance that the magical item became completely restored. The most definitive sources placed the chance at roughly 50% at every turn, improving for the most drastically powerful objects.\nThe spell called for verbal and somatic components as a material component, about 50 gold pieces worth of silver skein and two lodestones were needed."
