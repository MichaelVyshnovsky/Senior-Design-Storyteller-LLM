Healing touch was a healing spell used by sorcerers and wizards.
When cast, the spell allowed the caster to transfer some of their life force to another. The amount of life force transferred was determined by the casters skill level. The spell weakened the caster as it inflicted the equivalent damage of the life force drained.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
