'''''Reverse flow''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell allowed a wu jen to change the direction of the current of a body of water. It could change the direction of flow of a river or stream, the direction of ocean currents, and even make a waterfall flow upwards. It was commonly used by ship-based wu jen, who used it to help their vessel to travel against a prevailing current. The spell also worked pumps and drains. ''[[Normal flow]]'', the reverse of ''reverse flow'', was used to return a natural or regular flow to water.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
