'''''Segojan's armor''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Segojan Earthcaller]].

==Effects==
When cast, this spell provided protection against mundane weapons in the same fashion as [[scale mail]] but weighed the same as regular clothing. In addition, it negated many combat spells such as ''[[magic missile]]''. The spell was vulnerable to ''[[dispel magic]]''.

==Casting==
Before casting, the caster had to gather some grass and roots and place them in a pile. They then sprinkled powdered [[iron]] over the pile during casting. The grass and roots then magically weaved themselves into a full suit of [[armor]]. Only the caster was able to wear the suit of armor.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the [[holy symbol]] of Segojan Earthcaller and {{SI|1|oz|long=yes}} of iron powder.
