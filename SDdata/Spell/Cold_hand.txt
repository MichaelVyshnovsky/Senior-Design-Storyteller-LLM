Cold hand was a divine alteration spell used by the followers of Auril.
When this spell was cast, the caster gained the ability to inflict harmful cold energy with their next touch. Despite the spells name, the caster released this cold from any part of their body.
While this spell was often used for attack it was used in some Aurilian holy rites.
This spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast.
