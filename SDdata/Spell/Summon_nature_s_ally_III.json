        "mainbody": "Summon natures ally III was one of the series of summon natures ally spells available to druid and ranger spellcasters.\nThis spell functioned just like all summon natures ally spells, which in turn resembled the summon monster spells. It could summon a single ape, dire weasel, dire wolf, giant eagle, lion, giant owl, satyr, large shark, constrictor snake, large viper, or thoqqua. It could also be used to summon a larger number of monsters from a lower level of a spell in the series.\nThe spell required a divine focus and both verbal and somatic components."
