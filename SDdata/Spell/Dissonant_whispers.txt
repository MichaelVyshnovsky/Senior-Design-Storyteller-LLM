Dissonant whispers was an enchantment spell that created a cacophonous whisper that damaged a target and could make it run away.
The caster would whisper a cacophonous sound that only the target could hear. It caused damage to the target and, if they couldnt resist the spell, they had to move away from the caster. If the target did resist the spell, then they only took half the damage and didnt have to retreat. If the spell was cast with a higher spell level, then the spell caused more damage to the target.
A target that couldnt hear would not be effected by this spell.
Only a vocal component was needed for the casting of this spell.
