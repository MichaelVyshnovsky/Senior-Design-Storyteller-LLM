Clarity was a necromancy spell cast by bards, clerics, sorcerers, and wizards.
This spell removed most effects hampering the targets mind. For each such effect removed the target was subjected to a minor amount of negative energy. It then provided full protection against all mind-affecting spells for the duration of the spell, ranging from little under a minute to a few minutes depending on the casters power.
The spell required only a  somatic component to cast.
