Hover was an arcane alteration and conjuration spell that allowed the caster to stop the movement of a falling, jumping, or flying creature for several minutes.
This spell only worked on a single target, so it could be used to separate a rider from their aerial mount. Any target capable of shifting into an ethereal state or to another plane of existence could escape the spells magic.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
This spell was found within the Libram of Lathintel.
