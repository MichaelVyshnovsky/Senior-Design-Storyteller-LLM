        "mainbody": "Command elementals was an enchantment/charm spell of the southern magic tradition. It was a very rare spell, but commonly used by elementalists and rarely used by conjurers. \nWhen cast, the spell allowed a caster to command, or take control of, an elemental. Only one creature from one of the elemental or para-elemental planes could be targeted. The spell had a range of 40 yards (36 meters). \nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components."
