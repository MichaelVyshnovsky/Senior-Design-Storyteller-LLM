'''''Steal portal''''' was a transmutation spell which would allow the caster to steal a portal.

==Effects==
The caster was able to steal any portal they had traveled through and relocate it to a new location within {{SI|400|ft|long=yes}} of the existing portal. The new location needed a portal frame in place or the spell would not work. The spell would not change a portal's properties and took approximately one hour to cast. 

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[somatic component|somatic]] and [[material component]]s.
