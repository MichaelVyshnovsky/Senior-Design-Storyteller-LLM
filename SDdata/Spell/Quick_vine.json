        "mainbody": "'''''Quick vine''''' was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] used by [[witch doctor]]s of the [[Malatran Plateau]] through ''[[spell fetish]]es'' rather than ''[[spellbook]]s''.{{Cite polyhedron/125/Living Jungle Spells|20}}",
        "Effects": "When cast, ''quick vine'' summoned a vine that sprouted from the ''spell fetish'' that contained the spell. The quickly-growing vine was {{SI|0'1|'\"|long=yes}} thick and could grow longer the more powerful the spellcaster was. The vine grew with the speed of {{SI|1'|'\"|long=yes}} her second and up to {{SI|10'|'\"|long=yes}} in its shortest form. The vine could attach itself to any non-slippery surface and support up to {{SI|100|lb|k|long=yes}} in weight, making the vine stronger as the spellcaster grew in magical power. The summoned vine could not be controlled by the caster apart from pointing it in a general direction. ''Quick vine'' could not enable a living creature.",
        "Components": "The ''quick vine'' spell demanded verbal and material components to be cast. Its material components were a {{SI|0'3|'\"|long=yes}} long vine that disappeared as the spell was cast, and is ''spell fetish'' that was not consumed by the spell."
