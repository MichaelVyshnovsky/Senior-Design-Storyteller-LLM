        "mainbody": "Hoardguard was a spell that could only be cast by dragons. It was used by dragons to protect their treasure hoard.\nWhen cast, the spell temporarily transformed the dragons breath weapon into magical energy. The dragon then breathed over their treasure hoard. The magical energy bonded the individual treasures of the hoard together into a solid mass. The appearance of the hoard or items was not altered. The hoard was then protected, each individual treasure unable to be moved or shifted. \nThe invisible magical bond was immune to all magical and mundane attacks, even a dispel magic had no effect. An antimagic shell spell had a limited effect, removing the magical bond only within its area of effect. Only two spells were able to remove the powerful magical bond from the treasure limited wish removed it temporarily for an hour, and wish removed it permanently.\nIf the dragon added new treasure to the hoard, the magical bond did not extend to protect the new items. The dragon had to re-cast the spell upon the new treasure. The spell was usually cast when the dragon had to leave their lair.\nThis spell required only a verbal component."
