Oracle was an arcane divination spell from the 5 circle of magic used by wizards in the 14 century DR.
When the spell was cast, it immediately canceled all effects of nearby illusion (or phantasm) magics of the 5 circle of spells and lower. The spells area of effect was  in radius surrounding the caster, and the caster could pick which effects and targets would be unaffected. This spell negated such magics as reflected image, invisibility, improved invisibility, mirror image, non-detection, and shadow door among others.
The spell was also known to allow the caster to see creatures hidden in the shadows.

* Kich, one of the Shadow Thieves fences who operated in Trademeet during the Bhaalspawn crisis.
