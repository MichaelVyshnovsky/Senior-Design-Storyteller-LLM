'''''Oracle''''' was an [[arcane]] [[divination]] [[spell]] from the 5{{th}} circle of [[magic]] used by [[wizard]]s in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Effects==
When the spell was cast, it immediately canceled all effects of nearby [[illusion]] (or [[phantasm]]) magics of the 5{{th}} circle of spells and lower. The spell's area of effect was {{SI|120|feet|long=yes}} in radius surrounding the caster, and the caster could pick which effects and targets would be unaffected. This spell negated such magics as ''[[reflected image]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[improved invisibility]]'', ''[[mirror image]]'', ''[[non-detection]]'', and ''[[shadow door]]'' among others.

The spell was also known to allow the caster to see creatures hidden in the shadows.

==Notable Users==
* [[Dinguer the Mad]], the [[duergar]] spell [[scroll]] vendor in the [[Black Pits]] gladiatorial arena in the [[Underdark]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR.
* [[Kich]], one of the [[Shadow Thieves]] fences who operated in [[Trademeet]] during the [[Bhaalspawn crisis]].
