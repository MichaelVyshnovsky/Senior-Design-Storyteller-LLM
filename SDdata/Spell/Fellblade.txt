Fellblade was an abjuration, evocation, and necromancy spell used by wizards.
This spell created a murky object of force shaped like a blade measuring up to  in length. The fellblade needed to remain in the casters grasp or it would instantly fade to nothing. In addition to causing normal harm, a strike from a fellblade could drain enough vitality from the target to fully heal the caster. Each of these draining attacks shortened the length of the spell by ten minutes. A strike could also cause a similar effect to the bestow curse spell.
The vile nature of the fellblade risked tainting a caster who was pure of heart.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a drop of the casters blood, a piece of cold-wrought iron, and a drop of unholy water to cast.
