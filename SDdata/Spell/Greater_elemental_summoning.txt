'''''Greater elemental summoning''''' was a powerful [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s, [[druid]]s and [[shaman]]s.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell summoned one of three Princes of Elemental Good—[[Chan]], [[Sunnis]], or [[Zaaman Rul]]—randomly from either the Elemental Plane of [[Elemental Plane of Air|Air]], [[Elemental Plane of Earth|Earth]] or [[Elemental Plane of Fire|Fire]]. The summoned Elemental Prince obeyed the caster but only remained on the caster's plane for about ten minutes before returning to their home plane.
