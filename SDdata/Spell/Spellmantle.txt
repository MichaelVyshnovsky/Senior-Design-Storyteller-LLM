Spellmantle was an abjuration spell used by clerics. This spell originated from Mystra.
This spell surrounded the caster in a protective aura that protected the caster from a specific spell. Casters with more skill could select more than one specific spell for the spellmantle to protect against.
In addition to protecting the caster, the spellmantle allowed the caster to use the absorbed spell energy and redirect it toward healing or to instantly trigger a pre-selected spell upon the caster. If the selected spell was one the caster had currently memorized it did not remove that spell from the casters memory.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
