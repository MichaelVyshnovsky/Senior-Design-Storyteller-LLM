        "Effects": "This cantrip could target a single creature within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. If the target did not resist the spell, the appropriate muscles relaxed or contracted to perform a slight head bob that was noticeable to anyone observing the creature. This spell was used to force an involuntary gesture that would be interpreted as the culture dictated, typically as indicating agreement or as an expression of greeting or recognition.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster pointed with the smallest finger at the target creature while surreptitiously nodding their head."
