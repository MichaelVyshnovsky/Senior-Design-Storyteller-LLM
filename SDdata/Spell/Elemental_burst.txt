'''''Elemental burst''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] that unleashed a burst of elemental energy from a target. The spell was very rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
To be effective, the target had to contain one or more of the elements [[air]], [[fire]], [[Earth (element)|stone]], [[water]], or [[wood]]. The spell had a range of {{SI|60|yards|long=yes}} and an area of effect {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} wide. 

Each element had a different effect:
; Air : Created a burst of air that formed a concussive wave.
; Fire : Created a fire that would throw off sparks that ignited inflammable material in the spell's area of effect.
; Stone and Wood : Created a burst of sharp slivers of stone or wood. 
; Water : Created a strong wave that swept through the area of effect. Boats and ships were unaffected. 

If a wu jen attempted to cast this spell in the [[phlogiston]], the spell would fail.

==Components==
The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
