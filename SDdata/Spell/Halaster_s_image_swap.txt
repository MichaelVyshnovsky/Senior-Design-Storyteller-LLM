'''''Halaster's image swap''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to swap locations with an [[illusory]] image they had formed, by means of casting ''[[project image]]''. It was developed by the powerful [[archmage]] of the [[Undermountain]], [[Halaster Blackcloak]].

==Effects==
As soon as this spell was cast, the caster swapped their location with one of their ''projected images''. The exchange was imperceptible to nearly everyone nearby; those who saw through the initial illusion perceived the caster had walked through a ''[[dimension door]]''. It had a range of over 150' (45.7 m) or more, depending on the experience and prowess of the caster.

This spell had no effect if the caster had not previously cast ''project image''. The relocation of the caster did not count as breaking line of sight with the ''projected image''.

==Components==
In addition to a [[verbal component]], this spell required a small replica of the caster, such as a doll or figurine.
