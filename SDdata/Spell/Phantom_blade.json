        "mainbody": "Phantom blade was a spell frequently used by the Seven Sisters. It was sometimes used by Harpers but was otherwise uncommon.\nWhen cast, the spell created a transparent blade of magical force. The blade, although translucent, resembled a blade made from shadow. The blade acted as a normal sword. When a creature was struck with the blade, they were not only cut but also experienced a deep chill. The blade was especially deadly against undead creatures and dual-plane creatures, for example creatures who phased between the Prime Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. The sword was useless against inorganic objects.\nThe blade did not share the same physical properties as a blade created from metal. It was non-conductive, non-magnetic and non-reflective.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components."
