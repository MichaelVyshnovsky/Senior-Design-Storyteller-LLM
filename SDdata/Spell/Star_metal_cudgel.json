        "mainbody": "Star metal cudgel was a spell from the conjuration school of magic, used by druids and rangers.\nWhen cast, the spell conjured a bludgeon made out of meteoric iron into the casters hands. A star metal cudgel remained in the casters hands for 180 seconds or until dismissed. This magical weapon had a potent +2 enchantment to its damage and a potent +4 magic that guided the casters hand toward the target. This summoned weapon was especially deadly when wielded against undead creatures and constructs."
