A variant of the spell was used by shugenja in Kara-Tur and was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhile a dragon maintained concentration on this spell, the determination and morale of any person or creature within its presence was unaffected. Its effects could be ended at any time, by choice of the caster. The effects of the spell used by shugenja was similar, it calmed those affected by confusion, fear or insanity.\nThe spell used by dragons required only a verbal components. The spell used by shugenja, in addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, either a page of sutras or a prayer wheel."
