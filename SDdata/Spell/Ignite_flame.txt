'''''Ignite flame''''' was a common [[evocation]] spell of the [[southern magic]] tradition{{Southernmagic}}. 

==Effects==
The spell created a small, hot flame. The maximum size of the flame was 3 square-inch (7.6 square-centimeter) and could be cast in a 10 yd (9 m) radius from the caster. The spell would automatically destroy certain flammable materials, such as [[paper]]. A creature targeted by the spell could smother the fire before the flame spread. The fire produced by the spell was not magical.  
 
==Components==
The spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components.
