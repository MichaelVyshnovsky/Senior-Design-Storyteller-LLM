Ignite flame was a common evocation spell of the southern magic tradition. 
The spell created a small, hot flame. The maximum size of the flame was 3 square-inch (7.6 square-centimeter) and could be cast in a 10 yd (9 m) radius from the caster. The spell would automatically destroy certain flammable materials, such as paper. A creature targeted by the spell could smother the fire before the flame spread. The fire produced by the spell was not magical.  
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
