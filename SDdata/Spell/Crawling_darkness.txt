'''''Crawling darkness''''' was a [[divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] that conjured a shroud of dark appendages that surrounded the caster.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, the cleric was enveloped in shadowy, semi-corporeal tentacles. Their body was obscured by these dark appendages, though they could still see with complete clarity.

The shroud moved with the casting cleric and offered them some effects and protects as per a few other spells: ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[water walk]]'' and ''[[slay insect]]''. In the latter case, the tentacles killed any swarm of insects they encountered and then dissipated.

==History==
The specifications of this spell were revealed by the [[Shar]]ran [[relic]] ''[[Gorothir's Girdle]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The latter of which included a bit of spiderweb, a small amount of soot, and a tentacle taken from any sea animal.
