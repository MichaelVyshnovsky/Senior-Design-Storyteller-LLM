Suspension was a stronger version of the levitate spell. It was believed to be involved in the unique magic that kept skyships afloat.
This spell was jealously guarded by native wizards of Halruaa.
This spell could be cast on a person, an object, or any type of creature. Tons of material could fall under the influence of this spell if the caster was strong enough. The caster only needed to concentrate when raising or lowering the object of this spell, allowing for up to 120 ft. (36.6 m) of movement within one minute.
This spell required a leather loop, hung from a bent golden wire, to cast.
