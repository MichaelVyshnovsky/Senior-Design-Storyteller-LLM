Warding wind was an evocation spell that created a loud cyclone of protective wind around the caster.
The spell stirred the air within a radius of  of the caster to spin in a violent wind at a speed of  per hour that lasted for up to 10 minutes, as long as the caster kept concentrating. The wind was loud enough to deafen all within the affected area. It extinguished unprotected flames in the area and also dissipated vapors, gases, and fog. Any creature other than the caster could only traverse the area at great difficulty, and projectile weapons crossing the wind became extremely unreliable.
The spell only required verbal components.
