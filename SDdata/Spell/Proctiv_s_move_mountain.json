        "mainbody": "Proctivs move mountain was a legendary Netherese spell that sheared off a mountaintop, allowing the creation of the famous Netherese enclaves.\nThe spell was extremely direct in its applications. With the arcanists guidance, it severed the section of mountain desired, rotated it so that the flat side faced upward, and maintained a levitation effect that kept it aloft until more permanent arrangements could be made.\nThe material components for this spell were a mythallar (which needed to be placed in the new city within two weeks), a magical device that allowed flying or levitation, and a crystal ball.\nThe spell was created by the arcanist Proctiv in , and without it the construction of Netherils flying enclaves would have been near-impossible. As an epic spell, it could no longer be cast due to the restrictions placed on magic by Mystra after Karsuss Folly in . Later ages remembered the spell simply as move mountain.\nCategoryAlteration spells\nCategoryTransmutation spells\nCategoryVariations\nCategoryProctivs spells\nCategoryEpic spells\nCategoryArcanist spells (2e)\nCategoryWizard spells\nCategorySpells\n5pyerl1rtgg5av0fjxykkws6q0cigjf"
