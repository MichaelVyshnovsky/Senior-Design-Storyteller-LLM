        "text": "Well—get on with it. I'm a deep gnome, you're a drow. You helped me, now you plan to enslave me.",
        "mainbody": ": In all the Underdark, no being was as satisfyingly to slay for the drow as a deep gnome. Conversely, deep gnomes feared and despised the murderous, demon-worshiping drow more than any other foe in the Underdark, and never truly allied with them.\n\n: Even so, both deep gnomes and drow were willing to trade with one another despite their moral differences (drow offered not only information but had extensive trade routes which the deep gnomes found particularly valuable). The drow would destroy any trading partner if needed without compunction and the deep gnomes had no trust in the dark elves, putting a lot of effort into hiding their settlements from all their sworn enemies. Unlike the more stalwart dwarves, deep gnomes would withdraw when faced with persistent and powerful drow attacks.\n\n===Animals===\nThe drow didn't often keep animals as pets, preferring to keep creatures that could completely comprehend their dependence on their owners. Instead, many drow took a favored slave as a personal servant or thrall, slaves that were treated as little more than pets. They did however, domesticate a number of animals for various purposes, and were known to take advanage of molds, fungi, and [[ooze]]s by using them as traps and for sanitation.\n\n;[[Bat]]s: The drow were fond of bats of all kinds (including both carnivore or herbivore varieties), and commonly kept them as pets. Drow enjoy the company of bats of all kinds, whether carnivorous or herbivorous. The carnivorous bats would eat insects and the small, flying creatures of the Underdark (but spider-eating species would be exterminated) while the herbivorous bats either had adapted to subsist on Underdark fungi or had to have fruit imported from the surface, meaning they were limited to only the richest and influential drow.\n\n: Bats of all sizes and breeds were used by the drow for various purposes, including as spies, scouts, alarms, fighting animals, and messengers (like carrier pigeons).\n\n: Larger bats were kept in small rooms within drow mansions and frequently cleaned by slaves to remove the smell. [[Dire bat]]s were sometimes bred to battle each other (either in the air or in crude arenas after being crippled) in horrid dogfights that were the source of many drow wagers. A few communities used them as flying mounts, although doing so was dangerous and normally it was commoners (even commoner children) who were forced to do so, ensuring that it would be no great loss if either rider or steed died. The dire bats were trained in how to be steered using a [[bit and bridle]] while the rider was trained how to hold onto the harness and not fall off. Normally these riders only scouted or harassed enemies with poisoned crossbow bolts.\n\n: While they didn't serve as familiars, the whimsical [[azmyth]] could befriend drow and serve them as companions as easily as they could bedevil them.\n\n;[[Cavvekan]]s: Cavvekans, also known as cavedogs, had learned to coexist with beings like the drow. They were rare near dangerous drow cities, and thus were rarely taken as pets, instead being used as work animals Because their senses were superior to dark elves, the drow used them as guards or as hunting dogs, their ability to track by scent reaching the level of bloodhounds.\n\n;[[Lizard]]s: Subterranean lizards of various types had uses among the drow, and such creatures were the animals they most often domesticated. Some were even bred for specific purposes; the sticky pads of those used as mounts or pack animals were selected traits. The larger and slower breeds were used as beasts of burden, [[pack lizard]]s being a key example.\n\n: The steady gait, balance, and wall-walking abilities of [[riding lizard]]s made them ideal mounts for drow patrols. Most Houses had at least a handful and the larger ones had entire squadrons of lizard cavalry, although unlike human knights, they crept unnoticed across the ceilings of caves to pepper the enemy with crossbow bolts rather than valiantly charge into battle. By the time the enemy realized what was happenening, most had been rendered unconscious. They also had a keen sense of smell and were trained to follow silent directions, mitigating their inability to see in the dark, \n\n: The slimy, skink-like [[spitting crawler]]s were favorites among male drow living in a typical Lolthite society, highly prized and commonly used by wizards as familiars and otherwise used as pets. Given that their acid was incredibly potent and extremely irritating even if only slightly exposed, they were unsuitable for children or very vain drow.\n\n;[[Night hunter]]s: Night hunters, evil creatures able to see even further into the dark than the drow, were sometimes domesticated by the dark elves and used as aggressive pets or familiars.\n\n;[[Rothe]]: Rothe, more precisely the smaller [[deep rothe]], were also commonly domesticated by the drow. They were a common food source and a beast of burden for merchants and farmers wherever they were found.\n\n;[[Shrieker]]s: Shriekers, despite being fungi rather than animals, were kept as pets by unusual drow communities that worshiped [[demon]]s or strange gods. They were also used as a warning system for certain areas within noble Houses. There were a plethora of shrieker varieties, each giving off different sounds, and they were both easy to care for and could be trained to recognize certain creatures. They could also be eaten if they grew too big or became too unruly, and some drow delighted in eating them live, savoring the screams like they were those of a surface elf.\n\n;Slaves: Like shriekers, slaves were not technically animals, but it was not uncommon for young nobles to adopt them as \"pets\". and children were particularly likely to pick a pet if the being was physically small or perceived to be stupid (such as most goblins and kobolds).\n\n:Though their lives of child slaves were comparatively pampered compared to ordinary servitors, they were still treated as little more than animals, their lives always forfeit. They were often chained in small rooms when the child didn't want to play, and many were neglected and forgotten for weeks on end (perhaps if they misbehaved in some way) or just tortured to death when the child tired of them. Such pets were easily replaceable.\n\n;[[Snake]]s: Snakes were common drow companions, including both [[constrictor snake|constrictor]]s and [[venomous snake|venomous]] serpents. Drow torturers enjoyed extracting the venom of their pets to increase the agony of their victims. Younger drow, particularly priestesses-in-training, sometimes had small consrictors as pets, and often fed them flesh carved from living slaves to \"train\" them. Spitting snakes were placed in cages on high shelves so that they could spew venom at intruders.\n\n: Snakes, being generally venemous, were favored creautres to Lolthites, occupying a clear second-place position in sanctity next to arcachnids, and individuals that died in Lolth's disfavor were said to reincarnate as either. Favored ones that died while protecting a temple to Lolth were used to create the ''[[scourge of fangs|whips of fangs]]''.\n\n;[[Spider]]s: Spiders, being the symbol of Lolth, were the animals most closely associated with the drow, and they had a variety of roles in a drow community depending on their size. Very small ones were kept as pets by children in lairs made of metal and glass, while those big enough to kill mice served as familiars or roamed the streets acting as pest controllers. Those of dog-size sometimes served as temple guards (and were occassionally resurrected and bound to spider-demon upon their death), while those of horse-size were used as steeds.\n\n: Due to the difficulty of training unintelligent vermin, spiders in drow communities were often specifically bred for their purpose. The [[sword spider]], was an excellent example Spider-like outsiders such as [[bebilith]]s, [[myrlochar]], and [[retriever]]s were also a common sight in Lolth's temples.\n\n: Drow cities weren't full of spiders solely because of the faith. The drow had an affinity for spiders and they in turn were attracted to the drow, leading to large concentrations of spiders even in communities that didn't worship Lolth.\n\n: However, other sources claimed that rather than revering spiders, it would be more accurate to say that the drow emulated them, meaning they ruthlessly preyed upon even their own kin. Hurting spiders was still somewhat taboo, as the act could be used against a drow by their superiors, but it was possible their attitude was less reverence and more indifference until it became inconvenient. Some drow families even ceremoniously ate spiders before a meal to give thanks to the Spider Queen.",
        "Description": {
            "Coloration": "Drow skin tones ranged from dark grey, jet-black, and [[obsidian]], (with various shades of blue), the albino drow known as the [[Szarkai]] being an exception. Drow had white, black, or purple teeth, while their gums, tongues, and throats could be red, pink, or purple.\n\nDrow eyes could be of any color, with bright red being the most common. Pale shades that appeared nearly white of blue, lilac, pink, or silver were also frequent. Drow with green, brown, black, amber, or rose-hued eyes existed, but they were rare. Purple or blue eyes indicated surface [[elf|elves]] and/or [[human]] ancestry. The color of a drow's eyes could also be indicative of their current mental or physical state; drow eyes reddened when they were angry, and turned yellow when they were sick, poisoned, or under some negative magical influence.",
            "Hair": "Drow hair could be stark white,\n\nDrow generally kept their hair long, and decorated it with pins and webbing made of precious metals.",
            "Clothing": "The majority of drow wore a ''[[piwafwi]]'', a fire-resistant, protective cloak, footwear that functioned as ''[[boots of elvenkind]]'', and a [[Drow house insignia|''drow house insignia'']]. The latter showed the House or merchant clan to which a drow belonged, be it as a member or servant. However, with the exception of the First House, insignias weren't openly displayed except when inside the House territory or the clan's base.\n\nNoble drow wore clothes and equipment of superior quality (except, of course, when they didn't want to attract attention). who also often used powdered [[Ormu]], an Underdark-moss, as eye shadow."

        "Personality": {
            "Alignment": {
                "Good Drow": "Unlike creatures such as orcs, drow had no innate inclination towards evil, with their morality having been colored by their society.{{Cite dragon/367/Children of Darkness|33-34}} \"Good drow\" made up about 15% of the entire race, although most of them weren't actually of the good [[alignment]], being merely [[chaotic neutral]] or [[lawful neutral]]. Within Lolthite societies, even drow with a disposition towards what was considered good generally had problems developing a strong personal sense of morality. They generally behaved the same way as evil drow due to social pressure, as being soft in any way was lethal in drow society and often resulted in the death of such drow.\n\nOnly truly exceptional \"good drow\", such as [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], were capable of freeing themselves from a Lolthite society.{{Cite dragon/367/Children of Darkness|31}} Furthermore, even those who escaped the cruelties of the Underdark found it more difficult to form long-term friendships than most races did{{Cite dragon/367/Children of Darkness|31-32}}"
            }
        },
        "Abilities": {
            "Base Powers": "Base powers were abilities that the drow could cast without any schooling, needing only simple practice. They varied slightly from person to person due to various reasons, including but not limited to genetics, personal talent, and divine favor. Drow magical abilities were somehow tied to the ''[[faerzress]]'', These abilities could also vary in the same person temporarily, depending on their personal (mental and physical) health situation, age, and degree of training. For example, a dying drow could double the effectiveness of the own innate powers by super-charging them with her or his own life force.\n\nThe drow could use their base powers once every day and, once employed, they could end the spell, move it around at their whim, or downsize it. Spells like ''[[dispel magic]]'' could end a base power's effect. Normally, a drow could not continue using these abilities when they started using another one, or started to cast a spell. A common or untrained drow could neither use nor maintain their innate abilities under the effect of light that was as bright as, or brighter than, sunlight, as it impeded their concentration.\n\nA drow's innate ''[[dancing lights]]'' spell-like ability\n\nIn addition to the normal effects of a ''[[darkness]]'' spell,\n\nUnlike the normal version of'' [[faerie fire]]'', a drow's spell-like version could create a glowing field that grew wider with the strength of the caster. but while a drow could change these colors, they always manifested a certain one if they made no choice. According to [[Seldszar Elpragh]], a drow's ''faerie fire'' worked by channeling ''faerzress''.",
            "Mature Powers": "Upon reaching a sufficient degree of expertise, the drow gained their so called \"mature powers\". These included the spell-like abilities ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[Undetectable alignment|know alignment]]'', and ''[[levitate]]''. Particularly intelligent and powerful drow could maintain two inborn abilities, or one inborn ability and one normal spell, simultaneously, using ''levitate'' and ''darkness'' at the same time for example. Like with base powers, it was normally impossible to cast mature powers in the presence of intense light.",
            "Noble Powers": "Some drow were born with more magical power than normal, allowing them early access to their mature powers. Such drow made up the noble class of their society, and among them this was a dominant trait. Not only could nobles use both base and mature powers more than once per day, but every decade they gained another daily use, with centuries old nobility having virtually unlimited uses. Unlike commoners, they could attempt to cast their inborn abilities even in the presence of light, but they could only maintain one of their spells in this condition even when normally able to do more.",
            "Light Weakness": "Before the 1360s DR, the drow would gradually lose their base and mature powers, as well as their defenses against magic, if exposed to sunlight. However, during the 1360s DR, [[Liriel Baenre]], guided by Eilistraee, carved her rune in the [[Child of the Yggdrasil]] with the intent of preserving her own drow magic away from the Underdark, but the act ended up allowing all drow to keep their powers on the surface. Despite Eilistraee guiding Liriel, speculations were that Lolth also had a hand in the matter.",
            "Lolthtouched": "Lolthtouched powers, the result of [[Lolth]]'s blessing, were perhaps the most distinctive abilities of the drow.{{Cite dragon/367/Children of Darkness|40}} Lolth's touch gave her a hold over the entire drow race, and overcoming it was only possible by becoming a [[redeemed drow]] who also managed to be judged worthy by [[Corellon]].{{Cite dragon/367/Children of Darkness|40-41}}\n[[File:Lolth-touched.jpg|left|thumb|''An image of a [[Lolth-touched]] [[bebilith]], drow, and [[giant spider]].'']]\n\nLolthtouched drow manifested abilities like ''cloud of darkness'', which would enshroud the given drow in shadow that was impossible for anyone but the caster to see through, and ''darkfire'', which made other creatures an easier target by surrounding them in harmless purple flames. Lolthtouched powers were seemingly fueled by the same source, and the use of such abilities were tiring for the drow, with only more experienced and well-trained drow able to cast both abilities separately. Through training, drow could manifest the so-called ''webs of darkness'' that both slowed and impeded a foe, while also limiting their vision. \n\n[[Curseborn]] drow could unlock even more Lolthtouched powers, including improvements of the aforementioned ''cloud of darkness'' and ''darkfire'' abilities. Other ways to improve these abilities included training to cast the ''cloud of darkness'' faster in response to harm, or to turn the ''darkfire'' into a flickering protective shroud that made the beneficiary harder to hit.{{Cite dragon/367/Children of Darkness|38}}"
        },
        "Combat": {
            "Military": {
                "Warfare": "When drow nobles warred against each other, the attacking side had to eradicate the entire enemy family in a single attack. If even one member of the defending family survived, they could apply for \"justice\", and the entire city would turn on the attackers. Alliances were not allowed in these kinds of attacks, and there was a minimum interim time (one year) between attacks on an individual house, giving them time to recuperate. Prolonged covert warfare between two houses, by means like assassination, were not exactly forbidden, but it was only tolerated for a time counted in years, after which the drow city's ruling council forced the two houses to enter open war.\n\nThis was the reason why drow society was in a perpetual state of very small-scale battle of underhandedness, instead of a series of bloody frontal battles. Making matters worse for the drow, in war situations, the noble Houses schemed against each other so that their rivals would take the heaviest losses, or carry the responsibility for any failure, meaning that they were incapable of forming a truly united front against their enemies.\n\nWar in the [[Underdark]] was far different from conflicts fought on the surface. The cramped space of the subterranean environment made it hard or ineffectual to amass giant armies, and most battles were actually skirmishes between small units or patrols. The drow avoided large sieges and pitched battles, in favor of focusing on skirmishes, as well as hit-and-run tactics and harrying strikes.\n\nUnderground warfare heavily involved the use of the natural environment as a weapon through the creation of tunnels to flank enemies, cause cave-ins, change the flow of magma, and so on.\n\nThe drow also had a knack for responding to their enemies' actions, including spellcasting. However, they were aggressive, if not outright impatient, and one way to gain an advantage on them was to taunt their warriors long enough for them to make a fatal mistake.",
                "Military Composition": "[[File:NoCoverD367.png|right|thumb|''A drow assailing a group of [[devil]]s.'']]\nWhile the exact equipment and size of drow warbands varied from place to place, it was possible to make some general assumptions about the composition.\n\nA drow patrol usually consisted of seven to twelve soldiers headed by a patrol leader and overseen by a commander, the latter of which normally had a maximum of three other individuals, either acolytes and apprentices or bodyguards, in tow. Ordinary drow patrols contained a maximum of around six individuals with basic training, the rest being elite warriors. These warbands normally included a mix of both male and female drow, with a homogenous patrol likely indicating that the tension between the sexes in their city was reaching a critical point.\n\nPatrol leaders were normally male drow with superior fighting skills or clerics trained in the use of weapons. An elite patrol was usually led by a female cleric with female bodyguards, and her \"acolytes\" were also female clerics of the same church. These patrols were special, for they had an additional cleric with healing duties who also worked as a spy for the church of Lolth.\n\nA \"pincer\" was the name for a collection of several patrols (two to four) led by one commander, usually some kind of spellcaster called an \"overleader\" or \"battle-captain\", who had up to four lieutenants called \"webmasters\". Ranking higher than battle-captains were \"battle-lords\" or \"warmistresses\" which had an entire patrol force as their bodyguards and to carry their magic items. Each House had a standing army of drow soldiers, priestesses, and wizards, which included contingents consisting solely of non-drow slaves, usually [[bugbear]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[minotaur]]s.\n\nAround three out of every ten drow patrols included somewhere between one to eight non-drow, such as bugbears, [[goblin]]s, or [[orc]]s as \"allied forces\". [[Mind flayer]]s were never a part of such groups, except when being escorted to a destination. When a drow died in battle, they were sometimes reanimated as a [[zombie]] if the lower half of the body was still functional. This was done to prevent the corpse from getting plundered, to provide the corpses a method of self-transportation, to provide the injured and immobile dead bodies with transportation, and to gain useful shock troops to use in battle.",
                "Equipment": "All warriors in a patrol usually equipped with [[short sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, up to three [[javelin]]s (with an atlatl to extend their reach), a [[hand crossbow]] with ten poisoned darts, and a [[buckler]] for protection. Patrol leaders were equipped with a hand crossbow, javelins with an atlatl, and a moderately enchanted mace to indicate their authority.:During wartime, the patrols doubled their numbers of poisoned darts, and every warrior was equipped with up to three ''[[potion of healing|potions of healing]]'' in steel vials that didn't rust.\n\nPatrols were outfitted with a scroll of ''[[protection from earth and stone]]'' to guard against cave-ins, while surface raiders or underground furtive attackers used an ''[[orb of duo-dimension]]'' to allow stealthy attacks."

        "Society": {
            "Architecture": {
                "Defenses": "The drow were mostly met in the [[Upperdark]], but the majority of their cities were found in the [[Middledark]] as a protection against aggressions from the surface. In fact, traveling all the distance down to the Middledark with an army from the surface wasn't a feasible undertaking. The gates of a drow city, as well as its important buildings, usually had ''[[jade spider]]'' guardians.\n\nThe places in the Underdark where drow built their city-states had to meet sevaral criteria. The caverns had to be huge, both for practical reasons and, according to [[Qilué Veladorn]], because the drow had a mental compulsion to be near the radiation and were drawn to it. Whatever the reason, when the faerzress disappeared, the drow-city usually collapsed too.\n\nThe faerzress radiation near most drow cities provided protection from magical spying via [[divination]], and also made it difficult, or even dangerous, to teleport within the area. Furthermore, the faerzress allowed cheap and easy creation of magic, ''[[drowcraft]]'' items, and the radiation had several defensive purposes. For example, drow often used [[shrieker]]s, a type of fungi that grew in faerzress-rich places, to warn them of incoming danger.\n\nHowever, the drow's relationship with faerazress could be as much a weakness as it was a strength. Their over-reliance on it meant that drow settlements were often stationary, leaving them relatively easy to locate and vulnerable to attack by various the forces of the Underdark. The radiation was also uniquely capable of causing mutations in other creatures; a flying [[roper]], for example, could be born in a faerazress-rich environment. If the product of such mutations was powerful, drow tried to avoid fighting it and keep it within a certain area so that would-be invaders would have to face it instead, turning it into an unwitting sentry. If the creature had a spider-like appearance, the drow would praise it as the work of Lolth and occasionally feed it with captives or lured adventurers.",
                "Waterworks": "A specialty of the drow was their ability to cut and shape stone, both with magical and mundane methods, to produce smooth-flowing buildings, and waterworks were a product of drow craftsmanship that received universal acclaim. Systems of intricately curved pipes that bore through solid rock, fitted with shut-off valves, side-channels, and pumps, collected and diverted water for various purposes, from dietary, to industrial, to waste disposal.\n\nThe valves were big, hollow stone spheres with two opposed holes, closely fitted into a basin, which had both inlet and outlet channels. They were attached to a large, counter-weighted lever that, when turned, lined up the inlet and outlet channels with the holes of the valve to let water come through. The flow was regulated by opening a sliding panel, which turned the sphere in such a direction that only the volume of water that filled it could pass through and be diverted towards a side-channel. The aforementioned pumps had two varieties: a corkscrew-type, that worked by water pressure, and a piston type, worked by slaves. Constant application of magic was needed to make the water seals function perfectly."

            "Classism": {
                "Commoners": "Most members of a Lolthite drow society lived under oppression, in a state of perpetual desperation and poverty. Commoners normally learned a craft or entered military training, while talented individuals could hope to enter one of the magic schools. Ironically, commoners had a greater number of multi-generation households, since their relatives had less to gain from their death, resulting in families who had many living generations of members. There also wasn't much to be gained from killing an elder (at least one that wasn't feeble), as they represented a valuable source of historical and general knowledge with realistic accessibility, although they elderly would be eaten if the city was faced with overpopulation.\n\nCommoners who gained enough expertise in a certain area, like [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]] as a warrior, might be adopted into a noble family. Commoners could also rise to a higher social station by becoming the consort of a noble, gaining the latter's last name for the duration of the marriage.\n\nConsort bonds were generally of temporary nature, however, due to accidental breeches of etiquette, the noble's disinterest, or because they were simply being used as a pawn in the political games of Lolthite society. The outcome was either a painful death or expulsion&mdash;usually the former. In general, rising through the ranks too quickly was dangerous for any drow, as the usual reaction was the formation of temporary alliances among those who believed they wronged to take the upstart down and such alliances were often successful. Nonetheless, noble drow valued commoners more than slaves, and usually sacrificed them only if a slave was not at hand.",
                "Nobles": "[[File:Drow_3E_-_Drow_of_the_Underdark_p11.jpg|thumb|250px|''A matron of the drow.'']]\n\n''See also: [[List of drow houses]]''\n\nDrow were ruled by their aristocracy, the drow Houses, made up by the families that had the strength and incredible influence to occupy the best lands, with most Houses often being located in close proximity to each other. While the nobles hoarded the best territory and resources, the rest of the population was forced to fend for themselves. These priestesses of Lolth that normally reigned over drow societies were poor rulers who tossed their cities into a haphazard organization. \n\nNoble Houses constantly fought each other and a public temple to Lolth often being built within the strongest family's territory. but they actively undermined opportunities and chances for any form of development in order to ensure that those below them didn't gain power (and with it, the option to turn away from Lolth).\n\nDrow Houses were founded by powerful drow individuals with special powers, whose traits would be passed to their offspring (see [[Drow#Abilities|under Noble Powers]]), and further augmented with magic items. Within a family, noble drow parents viewed their children as vehicles for their own advancement, a mindset which included sacrificing them for some potential gain. Noble drow families banded together for mutual protection and not out of affection. Noble drow stayed with their family as children to protect themselves from outside violence, and as adults because Houses proved to be good tools for societal advancement.\n\n{{Fq\n| float  = left\n| width  = 300px\n| source = ''[[Mordenkainen]]''\n| text   = Matron mother is a strange title for a cruel tyrant, but given what drow consider to be a goddess, perhaps we shouldn't be surprised.\n}}\nThe head of a noble House was a matron mother, a powerful priestess of Lolth. Below her, in descending order of influence, were the female members of the House, who were also priestesses.\n\nFemales had absolute power within their household, and owned all the governmental and militaristic power within the city, although they held no authority until after puberty. Males never held any authority unless they managed to become an officer. In most cases, a matron only lost her position if murdered by her eldest daughter. This usually marked a new direction for the House, and sometimes even its destruction, because the murder of a matron was seen as a sign of disfavor from Lolth."

            "Justice": {
                "Violations": "It was considered a violation of the Way of Lolth to defy the hierarchy of their society in any way. This included but was not limited to killing spiders (which was possibly not an actual rule, but could be considered taboo), a slave disobeying their owners in any way, a commoner refusing the orders of a priestess (an exception being if the commoner belonged to another house, although even then the offended priestess was often allowed to flog them), and a student refusing the \"courting\" of a matron or female teacher. \n\nDrow society also had a strict fashion code (which included rules about hairstyles) meant to allow easy identification of a drow's social station and House (if any). Any drow who committed identification litigations by wearing the wrong hair style, clothes, and/or ''[[drow house insignia]]'' was considered a criminal unless the House authorized the use of their color or insignia or if the matron mother expressedly permitted a drow to change their hair and attire to appear as a different rank. It was also illegal for non-drow to disguise themselves as a specific drow, a noble drow, or a member of a House outside of the one they belonged to.\n\nFailing to completely exterminate the drow noble line of another House in a single attack, more than one House teaming up to attack another (one of the few offenses that had to be proven) or attacking a drow House within a year of the last attack against them were all offenses.",
                "Punishment": "Given the wickedly whimsical nature of drow law, punishment for many of the above offenses (especially refusing one's superiors) could range from immediate execution, death by torture, torture without death, mutilation, castration, imprisonment, exile, forced labor, whipping, and exorbitant fines (which the priestess could keep). Whipping and torture were the most common penalties since the priestesses enjoyed punishments that could be inflicted multiple times. Violation of the fashion code, disregarding exceptions due to authorization by the appropriate individuals, was always punished by death.\n\nFailing to fully obliterate another House or allying with another to do so was a crime punished by all other Houses destroying the offenders. While attacking a House in short succession wasn't technically punished by law, the offending Houses's priestesses would lose Lolth's favor and be unable to cast spells until they performed a great deed to regain it. This practically assured a House's destruction as they were forced to fall back on diplomatic and physical methods of defense, with all other Houses able to attack them with impunity."

            "Gender Roles and Family": {
                "Magic": "Arcane magic was a route for power for male drow, though open only to a few. While they were still socially inferior to female drow, they weren’t in real danger of being killed by a priestess, while even accomplished male war commanders were in danger of being executed for perceived insults.\n\nMale clerics existed among the drow, but in [[Lolth]]-dominated cities, they were targets of her female followers, and Lolth barred them from achieving power beyond a certain threshold. They served in low-ranking positions under lethal risks, and though capable of becoming [[divine disciple]]s, it often caused the priestesses to kill them. Other drow deities had different approaches to gender. [[Ghaunadaur]] had no gender restrictions,\n\n[[Eilistraee]] accepted clergy of all genders and races, although before the 1370s DR, her actual clerics could only be female. This was less due to any supposed inferiority of males, but because becoming one required a greater understanding and sensitivity of the \"life of the other gender”. For lack of better terminology, one simply couldn't truly feel the Divine Dance of Eilistraee \"properly\" except as a female, and so her rare and secretive male priests had to spend some time as a female, not just for the duration of a ritual called the Changedance, but in everyday ways. However, during the 1370s DR, Eilistraee started working towards opening up to male priesthood: for a time, males still had a harder time becoming clerics (see also [[Church of Eilistraee#Organization and Composition|here]]),{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/Non-drow and male clerics of Eilistraee}} but after the [[Second Sundering]], Eilistraee's clergy could be accessed by people of any gender with equal ease.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)/Malthulk, Taumurt, and male clerics of Eilistraee}}",
                "Children": "Given the need to compete for limited resources and advancement opportunities in their society, drow had an interesting relationship with children. On some level drow recognized that the children were the future of their race, the vulnerability of young drow to magic for example having led to the development of the ''[[potion of magic resistance]]''. However, an honest bond of love between parent and child in drow society was even rarer than one between lovers. Instead, the relationship between drow and their children was frequently one of mutual exploitation, each using the other as a tool only so long as they still needed them. A child born with physical malformations or imperfections, due to the drow obsession with beauty, was killed shortly after birth. \n\nDue to their competitive society, drow tried to instill the ideals of tenacity, cruelty, ambition, self-reliance, and independence in their children. Since traits like kindness or compassion were considered dangerous and exploitable, children who showed such weakness were punished. Punishment ranged from beatings to neglect, such as withholding food, with the goal of the abusive treatment being to prepare the child for the cruelty of their future lives. These punishments could prove lethal, and the inevitable child deaths were justified as \"saving\" the child from an even worse fate as an adult. Drow children learned cruelty and bloodthirst both as a survival mechanism, and as a defensive mechanism to escape punishment, and these lessons generally scarred a drow and stuck with them for life.\n\nThis was when a drow's parents were actually ''in'' the drow's life. Noble drow weren't raised by their parents, whom they only rarely saw a few times a year, but by elder siblings and private caretakers before being sent to the city's priesthood, military, or wizard academy depending on gender and inclination. In effect, each was a kind of boarding school for children over ten years old, which normally only allowed them to return home once per year for important family or religious meetings. Merchant clans and commoners (who lacked the resources to hire tutors) considered raising children the entire family's duty, before they learned the parent's craft, enrolled in the military, or joined a wizard or cleric academy. Whether noble or commoner, children generally lacked any strong parental bonds, being both physically and emotionally distant to their absentee parents, thus limiting the emotional growth they could achieve in a more normal (by surface standards) home environment."

                "[[Bat]]s": "The drow were fond of bats of all kinds (including both carnivore or herbivore varieties), and commonly kept them as pets. Drow enjoy the company of bats of all kinds, whether carnivorous or herbivorous. The carnivorous bats would eat insects and the small, flying creatures of the Underdark (but spider-eating species would be exterminated) while the herbivorous bats either had adapted to subsist on Underdark fungi or had to have fruit imported from the surface, meaning they were limited to only the richest and influential drow.\n\n: Bats of all sizes and breeds were used by the drow for various purposes, including as spies, scouts, alarms, fighting animals, and messengers (like carrier pigeons).\n\n: Larger bats were kept in small rooms within drow mansions and frequently cleaned by slaves to remove the smell. [[Dire bat]]s were sometimes bred to battle each other (either in the air or in crude arenas after being crippled) in horrid dogfights that were the source of many drow wagers. A few communities used them as flying mounts, although doing so was dangerous and normally it was commoners (even commoner children) who were forced to do so, ensuring that it would be no great loss if either rider or steed died. The dire bats were trained in how to be steered using a [[bit and bridle]] while the rider was trained how to hold onto the harness and not fall off. Normally these riders only scouted or harassed enemies with poisoned crossbow bolts.\n\n: While they didn't serve as familiars, the whimsical [[azmyth]] could befriend drow and serve them as companions as easily as they could bedevil them.",
                "[[Cavvekan]]s": "Cavvekans, also known as cavedogs, had learned to coexist with beings like the drow. They were rare near dangerous drow cities, and thus were rarely taken as pets, instead being used as work animals Because their senses were superior to dark elves, the drow used them as guards or as hunting dogs, their ability to track by scent reaching the level of bloodhounds.",
                "[[Lizard]]s": "Subterranean lizards of various types had uses among the drow, and such creatures were the animals they most often domesticated. Some were even bred for specific purposes; the sticky pads of those used as mounts or pack animals were selected traits. The larger and slower breeds were used as beasts of burden, [[pack lizard]]s being a key example.\n\n: The steady gait, balance, and wall-walking abilities of [[riding lizard]]s made them ideal mounts for drow patrols. Most Houses had at least a handful and the larger ones had entire squadrons of lizard cavalry, although unlike human knights, they crept unnoticed across the ceilings of caves to pepper the enemy with crossbow bolts rather than valiantly charge into battle. By the time the enemy realized what was happenening, most had been rendered unconscious. They also had a keen sense of smell and were trained to follow silent directions, mitigating their inability to see in the dark, \n\n: The slimy, skink-like [[spitting crawler]]s were favorites among male drow living in a typical Lolthite society, highly prized and commonly used by wizards as familiars and otherwise used as pets. Given that their acid was incredibly potent and extremely irritating even if only slightly exposed, they were unsuitable for children or very vain drow.",
                "[[Night hunter]]s": "Night hunters, evil creatures able to see even further into the dark than the drow, were sometimes domesticated by the dark elves and used as aggressive pets or familiars.",
                "Rothe": "Rothe, more precisely the smaller [[deep rothe]], were also commonly domesticated by the drow. They were a common food source and a beast of burden for merchants and farmers wherever they were found.",
                "[[Shrieker]]s": "Shriekers, despite being fungi rather than animals, were kept as pets by unusual drow communities that worshiped [[demon]]s or strange gods. They were also used as a warning system for certain areas within noble Houses. There were a plethora of shrieker varieties, each giving off different sounds, and they were both easy to care for and could be trained to recognize certain creatures. They could also be eaten if they grew too big or became too unruly, and some drow delighted in eating them live, savoring the screams like they were those of a surface elf.",
                "Slaves": "Like shriekers, slaves were not technically animals, but it was not uncommon for young nobles to adopt them as \"pets\". and children were particularly likely to pick a pet if the being was physically small or perceived to be stupid (such as most goblins and kobolds).\n\n:Though their lives of child slaves were comparatively pampered compared to ordinary servitors, they were still treated as little more than animals, their lives always forfeit. They were often chained in small rooms when the child didn't want to play, and many were neglected and forgotten for weeks on end (perhaps if they misbehaved in some way) or just tortured to death when the child tired of them. Such pets were easily replaceable.",
                "[[Snake]]s": "Snakes were common drow companions, including both [[constrictor snake|constrictor]]s and [[venomous snake|venomous]] serpents. Drow torturers enjoyed extracting the venom of their pets to increase the agony of their victims. Younger drow, particularly priestesses-in-training, sometimes had small consrictors as pets, and often fed them flesh carved from living slaves to \"train\" them. Spitting snakes were placed in cages on high shelves so that they could spew venom at intruders.\n\n: Snakes, being generally venemous, were favored creautres to Lolthites, occupying a clear second-place position in sanctity next to arcachnids, and individuals that died in Lolth's disfavor were said to reincarnate as either. Favored ones that died while protecting a temple to Lolth were used to create the ''[[scourge of fangs|whips of fangs]]''.",
                "[[Spider]]s": "Spiders, being the symbol of Lolth, were the animals most closely associated with the drow, and they had a variety of roles in a drow community depending on their size. Very small ones were kept as pets by children in lairs made of metal and glass, while those big enough to kill mice served as familiars or roamed the streets acting as pest controllers. Those of dog-size sometimes served as temple guards (and were occassionally resurrected and bound to spider-demon upon their death), while those of horse-size were used as steeds.\n\n: Due to the difficulty of training unintelligent vermin, spiders in drow communities were often specifically bred for their purpose. The [[sword spider]], was an excellent example Spider-like outsiders such as [[bebilith]]s, [[myrlochar]], and [[retriever]]s were also a common sight in Lolth's temples.\n\n: Drow cities weren't full of spiders solely because of the faith. The drow had an affinity for spiders and they in turn were attracted to the drow, leading to large concentrations of spiders even in communities that didn't worship Lolth.\n\n: However, other sources claimed that rather than revering spiders, it would be more accurate to say that the drow emulated them, meaning they ruthlessly preyed upon even their own kin. Hurting spiders was still somewhat taboo, as the act could be used against a drow by their superiors, but it was possible their attitude was less reverence and more indifference until it became inconvenient. Some drow families even ceremoniously ate spiders before a meal to give thanks to the Spider Queen."

        "Culture": {
            "Art": "Due to the dark elf love of beauty, the demand for art and skilled craft, particularly exquisitely forged weapons, was high. Noble households often had their own exclusive sculptors and gemcutters.\n\nAbout a fifth of the entire drow race was capable of complex works, while only about one-tenth could create items fine enough to be enchanted or turned into ''[[drowcraft]]'' through the absorption of ''[[faerzress]]''. Even though capable artisans weren't few among the drow, there was a great shortage of such talents compared to the demand, and both nobles and merchant clans tried to have at least six on their payroll. Overall, artisans were among the most intrigant and paranoid drow. They used tricky devices like clothes with built-in items, gas-powered needle-throwers, extensile mechanical hands, wire-saws, and similar devices to defend themselves and break out of cages and prisons.\n\nArtwork and craftwork of the drow were often made out of materials like metal and cloth. They frequently included spider motifs, such as the curtains positioned to emulate spider webs that often adorned noble Houses.",
            "Variant Drow Cultures": "* [[Udadrow]]\n\nAlmost all drow were born into typical drow culture, and were known as [[Udadrow]]. These were by far the most common type of drow, and the only type known to most.{{Cite web/Legend of Drizzt}} Drow that remained loyal to Lolth were known as [[Lolth-sworn drow]].\n\nNot all Udadrow became a part of the violent mainstream culture that most of the race were forced to endure. Those few who escaped the life of the Underdark could break away entirely from their dark past, while some fortunate drow were actually born and raised outside of the world below. Some drow found virtue within themselves in spite of all the terrors they witnessed (or perhaps because of it). Others turned to better ways either out of guilt or simply because they were no longer forced to obey Lolth's dogma. Still others were dangerously insane, broken by the horrors that shook their psyches. \n\nThe drow who chose to live on the surface, outside of the churches of Eilistraee and Vhaeraun, did not form any kind of organized society and instead lived as hermits and outcasts. They would interact with other societies when needed, but not out of choice.\n\n* [[Aevendrow]]\n\nThough many drow followed the way of Lolth and became Udadrow, some rejected her. A mysterious band of drow headed to the far north and were seemingly never heard of again. This offshoot of drow became starlight elves, Aevendrow, who were skilled mages and lived in a much more free society. They were incredibly secretive in nature and virtually unknown, even by the oldest elves of Toril, living in their icy home of [[Callidae]].\n\n* [[Lorendrow]]\n\nSimilarly to the Aevendrow, the greenshadow elves, or Lorendrow, were a practically unheard of group of drow that rejected Lolth's teachings. This group headed south to a tropical jungle environment and drew power from the environment itself. Such drow were very wise and sought to live harmoniously with nature in their forest city of [[Saekolath]]."

Its goal was to strengthen Lolth and her authority by bringing all drow under the church's wing, while killing those who were in any way a challenge to the authority of the Spider Queen and her clergy.\n\n: Though religion played a large part in drow society, the caste system and other seemingly lawful aspects of the culture clashed with Lolth's intent and directives as a [[chaotic evil]] goddess. As a result, much of the tension between the clergy of Lolth and more secular drow came from this very different perspective.{{Cite web|url=http://forums.gleemax.com/showthread.php?t=702942&page=144|title=The one and only \"Ask the Realms authors/designers thread\" 3|accessmonthday=January 14th|accessyear=2009|author=[[Richard Baker]]|date=June 10th, 2008}}\n\n:;[[Church of Vhaeraun]]\n\n: The faith of [[Vhaeraun]] was the biggest among surface drow, and the second biggest overall among the whole race.\n\n: The Masked Lord was primarily worshiped by{{cite web/Alak Abaeir, Drow Assassin}} and by those people who dealt in the acquisition of wealth by illegal means, because as the god of thieves, he approved of greed. Vhaeraun was also a god of arrogance, and reinforced the race's sense of superiority.\n\n: Vhaeraun's faith was exempt from the ordinary rules regarding drow religion. Lolth's clergy considered the Vhaerun's to be a serious enemy, and the followers of the Masked Lord were outright called to be destroyed by Lolth's established order. There were also [[specialty priest]]s of Vhaeraun called [[masked traitor]]s, spies whom Lolth believed to be her clerics.\n\n: However, since the [[Second Sundering]], there were three ways to openly pray Vhaeraun in a Lolthite society. First, invoking the god of thieves when embarking on raids was a normal, accepted practice. Second, in the 1490s DR, the majority of the church of Vhaeraun were not revolutionaries, but simply people who wanted to improve their lot in life and worked towards that end. This was tacitly tolerated by the matriarchy but such people still hid their identities, for they passively resisted the established order and that remained dangerous. Third, there were true Lolth-loyalists who believed a legend that painted the Masked God of Night as a god who hid the scars that his mother inflicted him under a mask, and who lost his tongue to her. These loyalists scarred and silenced themselves, and acted as bodyguards for the matron mothers.",
            "Minor Faiths": "The drow as a whole held to many different religions outside of those accepted by most of their society. It was believed that the \"good drow\" collectively worshiped [[Eilistraee]], although in truth the more morally neutral of the \"good drow\" were split between the worship of [[Ghaunadaur]], [[Selvetarm]], Lolth, and Vhaeraun. Some drow living in [[Waterdeep]] also followed the gods of the Seldarine. The following faiths were of minor importance:\n\n:;[[Church of Eilistraee]]\n\n: The church of Eilistraee, drow goddess of beauty, song, and freedom, strove to release the drow from Lolth's web and build a place for their people on the surface world. In the Underdark they tried to reach their kin, while on the surface they offered help to the needy and nurtured arts, working to build peaceful relationships with the other races.\n\n: Most drow weren't aware of Eilistraee, as the matron mothers suppressed all records about her, Due to the nature of their goal, except when performing missions to bring other drow away from the Lolthite society,{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Dark Elf Portals: The Dark Maiden's Portal}} the faith was mainly active on the surface and had little presence in the Underdark.{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/Imberlur the Drow City}}\n\n: Some followers of Eilistraee lived within Lolthite settlements, either because they were trapped, in which case they looked to escape with their families (presuming they had any), or because they were infiltrators helping the other drow escape.{{Cite dragon/315/Sin Eaters of Eilistraee}} These drow were known as \"Secret Moondancers\",\n\n:;[[Church of Ghaunadaur]]\n\n: The church of [[Ghaunadaur]] believed that everybody capable of strength was allowed to wield power, an idea that actually devolved into an extreme form of \"might makes right\". The Ghaunadans' goal was to promote the faith of their [[deity]] and to ensure that he was fed with sacrifices, by killing followers of other deities and pillaging their temples.\n\n: Every drow had used to be more or less aware of That Which Lurks, but after the [[Spellplague]], knowledge about the Elder Eye was forgotten by the drow due to suppression from [[Lolth]]'s clergy.\n\n:;[[Church of Kiaransalee]]\n\n:The church of [[Kiaransalee]] was a fatalistic cult that concerned itself with vengeance and necromancy. They believed that, through loyal service to the Revenancer, they would be reborn as [[undead]] and live forever. Said service consisted of killing and re-animating people, while at the same time avenging every slight. Given the cultural weight of taking revenge in drow society, Kiaransalee had significant appeal.\n\n[[File:Zedarr.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Zedarr T'sarran|Zedarr]], a drow blackguard of Kiaransalee.'']]\n\n: Kiaransalee was a rather unknown goddess, and most of those who knew about her thought her to be a delusional [[lich]] who saw herself as a deity.{{Cite web enhancement/Underdark Campaigns|10}}\n\n:;[[Church of Selvetarm]]\n\n: The church of [[Selvetarm]], god of drow warriors, consisted mostly of guards and others who constantly honed their fighting skills and reveled in battle. Due to its emphasis on individual battle prowess rather than strategy, adhering to this faith blocked a drow from obtaining high positions in the military. Calling out to the Spider That Waits was mostly done by lower-class drow.\n\n: Selvetarm wasn't recognized as a god by most of his followers, who worshiped him as a powerful servant of Lolth (the only form of veneration of this deity that was accepted in the mainstream drow society). Venerating him as an individual deity wasn't tolerated within Lolthite settlements."

While they were known for the ability to create spells, and some of the magic known on the surface had also independently been developed by the drow, they also stole quite a lot of arcane knowledge from the surface by kidnapping casters during their raids. For example, the ''[[vipergout]]'' spell was originally developed by the [[scalykind]], but was still considered drow.

Overall, the drow used scrolls more often than surface races and were also known to create unique ones.\n\n;[[Path magic]]\nDrow practitioners of path magic organized their spells in the so-called Path of the Drow, also known as Lolth's Road, or the Spider Road. It was considered a lost path, i.e. generally unknown to other races.{{Cite dragon/216/Paths of Power}}\n\n;[[Psionics]]\nWhile the drow misunderstood psionics and distrusted its practioners, as in most societies, the dark elves were different in that their extensive dealings with duergar and illithids made them more familiar and somewhat more excepting of it. Though their leaders were skeptical of it, working to ensure it didn't threaten them, they often saw it as a useful and unexpected tool in their arsenal.;",
        "Economy": {
            "Merchant Clans": "The second greatest power group inside a given drow city were the merchant clans, whose success was important for the survival of the drow race. The clans were among the primary mercantile organizations in the Underdark, and their presence was common along its trade routes. Contrary to the Houses, merchant clans were run by male drow, since females considered interaction with outsiders to be too demeaning and dangerous for them. Outside the environment of the drow cities, merchant clans and noble Houses openly fought each other.\n\nMerchant clans had some variation, but often had a few rules in common. The lowest ranking members, almost exclusively non-drow, were called \"assets\", and made up the labor and military force of the organization. Male drow of merchant clans generally had no inhibitions when it came to interacting with other races, including surface-dwellers, because they knew that there was no chance of advancement within their society for them. In fact, many of the \"second ring\", as the managers of a merchant clans were called, were non-drow. A council of male wizards, called an \"inner ring\", ruled over the clan.\n\nOnly the most experienced and worldly drow of the merchant clans were capable of forming genuine friendships with the so-called lesser races, including mind flayers or duergars.",
            "Slavery": "In typical drow society, where the the concept of inherent value of life did not exist, slavery was an important practice.\n\nThe drow didn't see slaves as a valuable commodity, but as a cheaply and easily replaceable tool that they were allowed to treat cruelly and exploit at will. Slaves, in general, were not allowed to look into the eyes of a drow or to carry weapons without permission (a rule that was mostly enforced when the slave was a gladiator of some kind).\n\nGiven that all unskilled labor in drow cities was carried out by slaves, and that surface dwellers were considered to be the best for that role, surface raids were vital for the maintenance of the economy. No matter the size, these attacks had the primary objective to capture people, with looting considered a matter of secondary importance.\n\nLarge raid parties, consisting of hundreds of members that sacked entire cities, were rare. Most raids only involved small bands, and started with scouting operations, followed by either open bloodshed or by infiltration to kidnap potential slaves. Sometimes both methods were combined; one drow group could catch the attention of the residents, for example through arson, while another force fulfilled the actual objective of kidnapping people undisturbed. Due to the drow's weakness to sunlight, the attacks usually happened at night and ended before dawn.\n[[File:Drow_and_slaves-5e.jpg|thumb|300px|''Drow slavers marching prisoners.'']]\n* [[Bugbear]]s: Bugbears were common slavestock in drow cities and common part of noble families' slave soldiers.\n\n* [[Demon]]s: Having demonic slaves was a sign of prestige for the drow that demonstrated the master's power and intimidated their enemies.\n\n* Drow: Drow could also become slaves in their society, either because of an unpaid debt, or due to being nobles who were captured in battle but whose ransom wasn't paid. In some cities, such people were executed rather than enslaved.\n\n* [[Dwarves]]: Dwarves were among the most desired slaves by the drow, but they were also considered stubborn and intractable, to be enslaved if possible, but with execution being preferred.\n\n* [[Duergar]]: The rigid thinking and physical stamina of the gray dwarves made them favored as slaves.\n\n* [[Elves]]: Elves were among the most desired slaves by the drow.\n\n* [[Giant]]s: Giants, including [[troll]]s, were not considered good slaves due to their large bodies and fearsome strength.\n\n* [[Goblin]]s: Goblins were one of the races from which the drow commonly acquired their slaves.\n\n* [[Hobgoblin]]s: Like goblins, hobgoblins were a frequent source of slave labor.\n\n* [[Human]]s: Humans were valuable and treasured slaves, unless they had combat abilities, be they mundane or magical, in which case they were considered dangerous. Human artisans were especially valued, but they couldn't survive long in the [[Underdark]] environment and under such cruel masters.\n\n* [[Kobold]]s: Kobolds weren't valued as slaves as they were agile, independent, and too physically weak to make decent workers, but they were sometimes taken as entertainers and messengers.\n\n* [[Jermlaine]]: Like kobolds, Jermlaine were too quick and independent to make decent slaves.\n\n* [[Minotaur]]: Minotaurs were common among the noble House slave soldiers,\n\n* [[Ogre]]s: Ogres were common slaves among drow and often part of noble families' slave soldiers.\n\n* [[Orc]]: Orcs were one of the races from which the drow commonly acquired their slaves, valuable soldiers and manual laborers due to their strength, relative stupidity, and capability to live underground.\n\n* [[Quaggoth]]s: Quaggoths were often slaves in drow cities.\n\n* [[Sinister]]s: Sinisters were sometimes magically enslaved by the drow to serve as alarms due to their telepathic abilities. Their protective and offensive powers, including the [[hold person]] spell-like ability, made them particularly desired as bodyguards by fearful drow spellcasters."

            "Underdark": "Drow were the most wide-spread and numerous among the Underdark races. primarily in the latter. Drow were usually only sent in the [[Lowerdark]] as scouting parties, or as some kind of punishment for angering a matron.\n\nDrow preferred to live in areas that fulfilled certain [[Drow#City-States|criteria]]. As a result, most of their settlements were found under the [[Moonsea]], north and west of [[Iltkazar]], from the underground of [[Calimshan]] to the one of [[Icewind Dale]]. Their sphere of influence, however, was much larger.\n\nSome notable drow cities were:\n* [[Chaulssin]]: Chualssin stood out among the drow cities, as it primarily served as the headquarters for the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]].{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|1}}\n* [[Ched Nasad]]: Also called the City of Shimmering Webs, the city was built on magically calcified webs.\n* [[Eryndlyn]]: Eryndlyn stood out among the drow cities because it was split among three faiths: [[Ghaunadaur]], [[Lolth]], and [[Vhaeraun]].\n* [[Maerimydra]]: The drow of Maerimydra were responsible for the construction of the [[Twisted Tower]].\n* [[Menzoberranzan]]: While not particularly large, Menzoberranzan was the archetypal drow city.\n* [[Sschindylryn]]: Sschindylryn was a city where merchant clans took over after the constant infighting caused the matriarchy to fall from power.{{Cite web enhancement/Underdark Campaigns|10}}\n* [[Sshamath]]: In the city of Dark Weavings, wizards managed to wrestle power from the priestesses of Lolth. Various faiths could be found in Sshamath, both belonging to the Dark Seldarine and not.\n*[[Imberlur]], city of Eilistraee-worshipping drow located under the [[Border Kingdoms]], known for the production of [[Imberlur#Economy|Spellbones]].",
            "Surface": "The term \"surface drow\" referred to all individuals who spent less than four consecutive days below the surface in their regular life. Surface drow had no love for bright light, open sky, and loud noises, and a preference for darkness. Most surface drow were followers of Vhaeraun, not Lolth, and the vast majority of Eilistraee's followers were also on the surface. Among the surface, drow was not a huge problem like in the Underdark.\n\nA number of them embraced a truly different morality than most of their brethren, either because born on the surface, or because of a decision to abandon the way of Lolth. Some of those who came to the surface from the Underdark had already formed a different morality before leaving, while others had used to live under the Lolthite dogma. Among the latter, certain individuals were haunted by their past deeds, sometimes to the point of being broken by the weight of their horrible actions (even becoming a danger due to their mental instability), while others were truly unapologetic about their behavior in the Underdark, and pushed all responsibility on the necessity of it.{{Cite dragon/367/Children of Darkness|33-34}}\n\nMany drow on the surface were actually spies still loyal to Lolth, sent to infiltrate the enemy and gather information for their matrons. However, the more time a drow spent among its enemies, the higher the risk that drow would defect in some way. In some cases this was to undermine a rival house by perpetuating false information, while others began sympathizing with their foes, even to the point of believing they were undeserving of the hate they received and the violence their kin would inflict on them.{{Cite dragon/367/Children of Darkness|36}}\n\nSurface drow, while ignored by others, were attractive to the merchant clans, for they represented a contact to the surface for trade. For example, some surface drow managed to become traders who traded with [[Calimshan]], [[Chessenta]], [[Mulhorand]], [[Waterdeep]], or [[Zhentil Keep]]. That said, the majority of surface drow lived as hermits or found employment in rather unsavory areas of expertise where their heritage was an actual advantage, like adventurer companies or assassins' guilds."

        "Biology": {
            "Senses": "Drow eyes were sensitive to heat, possessing [[infravision]] up to a range of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}. Formal education or much practice was needed to \"read\" heat hues, as the drow had no innate ability to discern the meaning of the various patterns from birth. Cold objects appeared grey, while heat was seen, in ascending order of intensity, as blue, purple, red, and warm yellow. They also had [[darkvision]] up to the same range, but not the [[low-light vision]] characteristic of other elves. It took a drow about ten years of exposure for them to get used to the sunlight and to use their infravision and normal vision simultaneously.\n\nDrow had excellent hearing, a trait developed by necessity given the paramount importance of foreseeing rock shifts, collapses, and other hazards in the [[Underdark]]. It was also the primary means by which they found water, by listening to the dripping sound it made. They had long, slender fingers and a keen tactile sense, to the point of being able to read subtle markings on stone as if they were Braille. On the other hand, drow had a [[human]]-like sense of smell, far less keen than in the other Underdark races and than their other senses. Smells were dulled in the Underdark, and the ubiquitous smell of damp rocks and the fungi-riddled air of their natural environment, combined with the strong incenses and the scent of slaves in the drow cities, made it difficult to develop a keen olfactory sense.\n\nIn contrast to creatures such as dwarves or deep gnomes, who had a deep, intutive sense of stone and subterranean conditions, the drow race's specialty laid in the ''sculpting'' of stone, the cutting and shaping of rock into smooth-flowing forms. About 70% of drow had an intuitive understanding of how fortifications or waterworks were constructed, operated, circumvented, and controlled, an innate \"feeling\" that extended to works made by other races.",
            "Diet": "Drow liked to eat live animals because they believed the meat had a better flavor.",
            "Sleep": "Like all elves, drow required no sleep, instead entering a meditative trance while retaining full awareness of their surroundings. The trance lasted around four hours, and provided the same benefits as a member of any other race having a full period of rest.\n\nHowever, while elves relived parts of their memories, including those of past lives, during their trances, drow normally experienced nothing, save for the occasional dream (which they tried to interpret by looking for signs from Lolth). The fact that drow didn't relive memories of past lives during their trances was viewed as an indication that, unlike the elves, their souls didn't reincarnate.",
            "Reproduction": "The drow were believed to be more fecund than other elves, though in truth, they simply had a higher readiness to birth as many children as possible during their lifespan.{{cite web/Drow Social Relationships}} For example, in the average Lolthite society, a female drow with an active career under her belt gave birth to about ten children before she lost the ability to birth more.",
            "Lifespan": "Drow lifespans were comparable to the rest of the elven race (and therefore far surpassed those of humans), Provided they did not meet a premature and violent end, a drow's natural lifespan was about 750 years. and rarely lived past their seventh century, with about 94% of natural deaths occurring before 800 years of age.\n\nDrow who could afford a lifestyle that spared them hardships, like matron mothers, could live more than 1000 years (though, by that point, they would be withered by age). Lolth's magic could maintain a matron's life for thousands of years, and this was considered a clear sign of favor from the goddess.",
            "Blood-Related Races": "There were a number of races and creatures that were in some ways related to the drow.\n\n[[File:Tel-quessir races - Steve Prescott.jpg|thumb|250px|''Various elves; from left to right; Drow, wild elf, sun elf, wood elf, and moon elf.'']]",

            "Drow manipulation of history": "The history of the drow is filled with confusion and uncertainties. Many fanatical drow told lies and fabrications about their own history to serve the ends of the noble Houses and of the faiths.\n\nAt times, pieces of history were entirely deleted from the records. It happened to fallen noble Houses, as all information about them was erased, and by four generations the fabrication was accepted as \"fact\".",
            "View on historical heritage": "The drow descended from the dark elves of [[Ilythiir]], the first and one of the most powerful elven nations, and, in minor part, from the survivors of [[Miyeritar]]. One might imagine that the drow would constantly boast about this heritage, but the truth was that they didn't appreciate being reminded of their origins, for it also reminded them of their deep fall from power.\n\nOn the other hand, the drow remembered their origins because their feud with the elves was based on history. They believed to have been punished by the Seldarine for their triumph in the Fourth [[Crown War]], and used this as a justification for their entitlement to exact vengeance on the other elves and their gods."
