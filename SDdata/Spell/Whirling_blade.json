        "mainbody": "Whirling blade was a relatively powerful spell learned by some swordmages early in their training.\nWhen a swordmage cast whirling blade he or she first threw a melee weapon of their choice at a target, using the power of the spell to keep the weapon aloft in the air, striking the creature with deadly force. If they missed the first target, a swordmage could send their weapon twirling towards another creature within  of the first. This process could be repeated another two times and it was only upon striking true or missing a fourth target that the weapon ultimately returned to its wielder. The spell, due to its power, required a vast amount of energy on the swordmages part, meaning that it could only be cast once per day."
