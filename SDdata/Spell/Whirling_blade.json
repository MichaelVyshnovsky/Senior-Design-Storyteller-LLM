        "Powers": "When a swordmage cast ''whirling blade'' he or she first threw a melee weapon of their choice at a target, using the power of the spell to keep the weapon aloft in the air, striking the creature with deadly force. If they missed the first target, a swordmage could send their weapon twirling towards another creature within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the first. This process could be repeated another two times and it was only upon striking true or missing a fourth target that the weapon ultimately returned to its wielder. The spell, due to its power, required a vast amount of energy on the swordmage's part, meaning that it could only be cast once per day."
