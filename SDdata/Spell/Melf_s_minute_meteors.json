        "mainbody": "'''''Melf's minute meteors''''' was a [[fire]]-based [[evocation]] spell.\n\nTo [[Zakhara]]n mages, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''minute meteors''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Flame (province)|province of flame]].",
        "Effects": "The spell created six tiny meteors that orbited the caster for up to 10 minutes, until released upon a target or until the caster stopped concentrating. When released, the meteors exploded on impact.\n\nThe effects of ''Melf's minute meteors'' could also be achieved by accident through the misuse of [[opal]]s as components of magical items that evoked both fire and lightning.",
        "Components": "The spell needed [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[Verbal component|verbal]] components, as well as niter, sulfur and a bead of pine tar for materials.",
        "History": "''Melf's minute meteors'' was a rare spell in the [[1360]]s [[DR]] in both [[Faerûn]] and Zakhara.{{AQ-time}}",
        "Notable Uses": "[[File:Minute meteors DC Comics.jpg|thumb|left|''Minute meteors fired, yet somehow still missing, at point-blank range.'']]\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], the [[Shar|false avatar]] of [[Selûne]] hurled ''minute meteors'' at [[Kyriani]] in the kitchen of [[Castle Waterdeep]], but she was able to dodge them.{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|16}}"
