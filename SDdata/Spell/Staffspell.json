        "mainbody": "'''''Staffspell''''' was an [[arcane]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] from the third circle of magic that summoned a magical [[quarterstaff]] to be used in battle.",
        "Effects": "When the spell was cast, it created a magical {{SIAdj|6|ft|long=yes|adj=yes}} staff made out of electricity in the wizard's hands. The staff glowed at the caster's mental command and could be used as a source of light akin to the ''[[light]]'' spell. Additionally, the staff's damage was magical, similar to a ''+1'' enchantment that increased in power as the spellcaster's magic prowess grew. The ''staffspell'' could not be passed onto another user and could only be wielded by the caster. When wielded against creatures made of water or of aquatic nature, the damage inflicted with the weapon was doubled.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s to cast. The material component was a small wooden rod cut from an [[oak]] [[tree]] by the caster.{{Cite dragon/203/Arcane Lore: The Blue Books of Othyisar Du'Morde|35-36}}",
        "History": "The spell was recorded in ''[[The Blue Book of Othyisar Du'Morde Vol.I]]'', not surprisingly, penned by [[archmage]] evoker [[Othyisar Du'Morde]] from mountains in the northeast of [[Calimshan]]."
