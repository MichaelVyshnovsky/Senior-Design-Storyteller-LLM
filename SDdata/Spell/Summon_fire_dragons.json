        "mainbody": "Summon fire dragons was a spell used commonly in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by wizards.\nThe name of this spell was a little misleading considering that it did not summon any kind of creature. Instead it allowed the caster to create up to 10 fiery snake-like tongues of flame that were called fire dragons or flame dragons. Each fire dragon measured 6 ft. (1.8 m) in diameter and moved according to the will of the caster so long as they concentrated. The flame dragons would dissipate if the caster was struck or their attention was diverted in another manner. Additionally, each flame dragon could stretch across 180 ft. (55 m) of ground and reach 30 ft. (9 m) into the air.\nFire dragons could not strike against anything standing in water or anything situated higher than 30 ft. off of the ground.\nIn addition to verbal components, this spell required a strip of paper that was soaked in oil, coal, saltpeter, and sulfur to cast."
