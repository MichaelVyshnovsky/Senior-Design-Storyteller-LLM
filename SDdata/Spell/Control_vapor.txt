'''''Control vapor''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to [[drow]] [[cleric]]s,

==Effects==
This spell could be cast at a point up to {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} away and affected a spherical volume with a radius of {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} centered on that point. Within this sphere, for the next nine minutes, the caster could designate the speed (from zero to a radius-length per minute) and direction of any vapors caught in the sphere, regardless of prevailing winds or air currents (natural or magical). Higher level casters could increase the radius and duration of this spell. The drow version affected an area of {{SI|40|ft|long=yes}}.

Examples of vapors that could be controlled included fog, mist, smoke, ''[[cloudkill]]'', ''[[fog cloud]]'', ''[[incendiary cloud]]'', ''[[smoke ghost]]'', the smoke from ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', and gaseous breath weapons. The caster could hold, reshape, split, or combine vapors as desired. ''Control vapor'' could also be used to control or capture creatures in gaseous form, such as [[vampire]]s, [[air elemental]]s, and those using ''[[wind walk]]''. These creatures had no chance to resist the magic of this spell, but could transform to a different form (such as becoming corporeal) at half their normal rate, if they had the ability to do so.

This spell had no effect on swarms of insects or other nongaseous creatures, but smoke could be manipulated to intersect an ''[[insect plague]]'', for example. Any vapor that passed out of the stationary sphere where this spell was operating became free of the caster's control.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the use of the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a single bean or pea for the divine version,

==History==
In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, [[Chief Prelate]] [[Relarn Dayspring|Dayspring]] of the [[Clerical Circle]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] declared it illegal for priests to cast ''control vapor'' within the city due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]], threatening arrest for those that broke this decree.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}

==Rumors and Legends==
It was thought that at least one [[drow]] faith had a version of this spell.
