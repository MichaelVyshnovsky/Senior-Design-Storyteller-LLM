        "mainbody": "Ancestral blessing was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the spell called upon the ancestral spirits of the caster. The caster used this spell to seek advice or protection. The summoned spirit answered one question or bestowed a single blessing. The caster could also ask the spirit to guard a location. If granted, the spirit acted as an alarm, warning the caster against non-magical intrusions. The spirit guarded the location for up to one month and did not aid in the defense of said location.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a thimble and one dozen grains from any cereal crop."
