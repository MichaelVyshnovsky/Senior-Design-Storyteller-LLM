        "mainbody": "Like Toril, the axis was tilted, granting seasons to the planet; however, the effect of the seasons on climate and temperature was minimal.\n\nThe atmosphere had a high percentage of carbon dioxide, leading to a greenhouse effect that kept the planet very warm, about {{SI|150|F}} on average.

        "Description": {
            "Geography": "Falx had a thicker crust than most other planets of its size with a smaller central core of nickel and iron. This led to less volcanic activity than other [[Earth (element)|Earth]] worlds. There were no active volcanoes, hot springs, or other geothermal features.\n\nThe surface was relatively flat, with smoothed hills but no substantial mountains. The change in elevation from the highest point to the lowest point on the planet was only {{SI|8000|ft|long=yes}}. The planet showed evidence of previous meteor strikes in its history, in the form of craters. These craters were postulated to have once been filled with water. Since all such \"seas\" were now dried up, the planet consisted of a single continent. In fact, there was no permanent liquid water anywhere on the planet, all water was found in the heavy cloud cover or deep beneath the surface.\n\nBelow the surface, there was evidence of ancient volcanic activity, in the form of massive networks of hollow lava tubes and subterranean lakes filling massive caves.",
            "Climate": "{{Climate\n|boxwidth  = 250px\n|maxtemp   = 220\n|tempwidth = 34\n|temp1     = 150\n|temp2     = 100\n|temp3     = 165\n|temp4     = 80\n|label1    = Typical\n|label2    = Poles\n|label3    = Equator\n|label4    = 20,000'\n|temprefs  = \n}}\nLike Toril, the axis was tilted, granting seasons to the planet; however, the effect of the seasons on climate and temperature was minimal.\n\nThe atmosphere had a high percentage of carbon dioxide, leading to a greenhouse effect that kept the planet very warm, about {{SI|150|F}} on average.

        "Flora & Fauna": "While sages speculated that Falx once had water and life on its surface, for all of recorded history, the planet was almost barren. The only notable surface flora were called \"carpet mosses\" because of their appearance and feel. These mosses formed colonies that could reach hundreds of feet in width and were mobile. Most were red or orange in color, but there were many distinct species.\n\nAll animal life was approximately reptilian. Most of these small animals were under a yard (meter) in length and had four legs, but some also had six or eight. Most were venomous scavengers who fed on both mosses and other lizards. There were many varieties, such as the Falx imbul.\n[[File:Tarrasque.jpg|thumb|right|280px|''Could there truly be more than one of these things?'']]\nWhile the smaller animals and plants survived the heat and winds by hiding, the other major type of life form was simply large enough and powerful enough to resist such hazards. Falx was home to a population of several hundred creatures that were either tarrasques or creatures extremely similar to them. Some sages argued that the idea of the tarrasque being a unique creature was a falsehood and that the tarrasque of Toril was simply a specimen of the creatures from Falx that had been transported to Toril by some means unknown.",
        "Inhabitants": "All sentient lifeforms on Falx lived below the surface. By far, the most populous of these were illithids, although orcs and [[goblinoid]]s also had a limited population. These latter two groups were used by the mind flayers as slaves and food. There was also a relatively large population of [[myconid]]s.\n\nRumors existed of other sentient life below the surface, including marooned populations of [[dwarves]] and [[drow]] and even reports of [[aboleth]]s in the deepest watery reaches of the planet.",
        "Notable Locations": "The two major illithid cities of Falx were called Brain-in-the-Skull and Tentacles-Grip-Tightly, when directly translated into [[Common]]. Each was ruled by a mind flayer [[wizard]] rumored to have been trained by an alliance with the supposed aboleths. The former city, with a population of over two million, was in the northern hemisphere; the latter in the south, with a population of just under one million. The [[elder brain]] of Brain-in-the-Skull was so developed that its telepathic range was over ten miles (sixteen kilometers)!\n\nBoth cities cooperated with each other, and in addition, there were numerous other outposts scattered about the caverns of the planet.\n\nThe illithids of Falx were not in any way ignorant of [[spelljammer|spelljamming technology]], but for the most part, they kept to their own planet and considered how to dominate the other races living there. (A notable exception to this trend is discussed in the History section below.) The illithids defended their planet from any intruders, using such magics as ''[[astral projection]]'' and ''[[levitation]]'' to take out any ships approaching the surface.",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|1361}}, illithids from Falx had heard about the ''[[Cloak of the First Pilot]]'' and were actively seeking it. They hired a mercenary named [[Barrab]] to apprehend the cloak from [[Teldin Moore]] upon his arrival on [[Toril]], and their own vessels had even come as far as the orbit of Toril, where they happened upon the illithid historian [[Estriss]], Estriss was taken aboard as a guest.\n\nSome time later, the same illithids were still in [[Realmspace]], near the planet [[Garden]]. Let by the illithid [[Netarza]], they had captured an [[elven]] [[man-o-war]] and were attempting to learn more about the location of the [[dracon]] homeworld, when they had an encounter with Teldin Moore, which ended poorly for them.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some said that the aboleths were seeking a way off the planet and were working with the illithids to have their own [[spelljammer]]s and [[spelljamming helm]]s built for them."
