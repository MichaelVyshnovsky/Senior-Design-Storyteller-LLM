Listening shadow was a divine alteration and divination spell used by priests devoted to Mask, enabling them to transmit sound through a shadow.
This spell created a mobile shadow about the same size as the caster that transmitted sound within  of its location back to the caster. The caster could move the shadow about and change its shape at will. Experienced casters could even cast tongues on the listening shadow to understand different languages. Lead within a wall and gorgons blood were effective barriers to blocking the sound transmitted by the listening shadow.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
