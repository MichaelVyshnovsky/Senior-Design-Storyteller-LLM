'''''Listening shadow''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[divination]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Mask]], enabling them to transmit sound through a shadow.

==Effects==
This spell created a mobile shadow about the same size as the caster that transmitted sound within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of its location back to the caster. The caster could move the shadow about and change its shape at will. Experienced casters could even cast ''[[tongues]]'' on the ''listening shadow'' to understand different languages. Lead within a wall and [[gorgon]]'s blood were effective barriers to blocking the sound transmitted by the ''listening shadow''.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
