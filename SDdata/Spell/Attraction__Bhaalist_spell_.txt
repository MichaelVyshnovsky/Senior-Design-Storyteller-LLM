Attraction was a divine alteration spell that was granted to specialty priests of Bhaal, up until the Time of Troubles. It removed any negative feelings the target had towards the caster and replaced them with favorable emotions. The reverse of this spell, disdain, reversed feelings in the opposite manner.
This spell was commonly used by Bhaalists to counteract the air of death that constantly surrounded them.
Verbal, somatic and material components were required in the casting of this spell. The material component was the holy symbol of the caster.
