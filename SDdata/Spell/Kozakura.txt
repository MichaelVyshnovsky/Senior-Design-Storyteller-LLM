'''Kozakura''' was a nation in eastern [[Kara-Tur]].

==Geography==
An archipelago nation, Kozakura consisted of many islands. There were four large islands as well as dozens of smaller ones that made up the entirety of Kozakuran territory. The largest island, which was roughly {{SI|1400|miles|long=yes}} in length, was named [[Shinkoku]] and was the location for the imperial capital, [[Dojyu]]. It was also the center of Kozakuran population and culture, and was the most widely settled of the four major islands. The other three islands were roughly the same size, at around {{SI|200|miles|long=yes}} across, and were [[Tenmei]] (to the north of Shinkoku) and [[Mikedono]] and [[Hinomoto]] (both to the south of Shinkoku).<ref>

The islands were heavily forested in places, and there was no shortage of wood available for construction. At higher altitudes, forests tended to consist of [[cedar]] and [[pine]], and in the lower, more humid areas, [[bamboo]] and [[cypress]] were more common.

To the west of Kozakura were the islands of [[Wa]]. Across the Sea of Kozakura to the north was the peninsula of [[Koryo]].<ref>

==Politics==
The nominal head of government was a hereditary Emperor, who traditionally took over from his father at a very young age, necessitating the services of a regent to rule in his name. The old Emperor was forced into retirement, but still maintained some influence with a title of Retired Emperor. This meant that generally there were three factions in the Imperial Court vying for control.

Over several hundred years, the position of Emperor faded in importance and the shogun became the ''de facto'' ruler of Kozakura. The position of Shogun was, however, tainted with much of the same politics and maneuvering that affected the Emperor.  This resulted in many shoguns ascending to the position at a young age themselves, and the need for a shikken, which was a regent for the Shogun.

==Society==
Kozakuran society had a caste system. At the highest level were the samurai caste.<ref group="note">This should not be confused with the [[samurai]] class for player-character class. The samurai caste were the nobles of Kozakura and responsible for the administration of the provinces and the nation. They were organized by their families.

Beneath the samurai caste were the clergy, who served as priests in the various temples. The clergy welcomed people from all walks of life, including retired samurai, sons of peasants, widows, and so on.

The majority of the population was made up of the peasants, who were divided into several groups. The farmers tended to be the backbone of the land, and were also organized into families in the same way as the samurai caste, with the head of a family responsible for collecting rent and taxes. Craftsmen had variable status depending on their craft, their skill, and their renown. Merchants, including moneylenders were found at this level, though they might have some control over the other members of the peasant class economically. The lowest of the peasant class were the entertainers, including actors, singers, and musicians.

Below even the peasants were the outcasts, called ''eta'', who performed duties that were considered distasteful, unclean, or forbidden. Outcasts were quite literally cast out from the rest of society. All the other castes treated them with contempt, and contact was generally avoided. They were considered non-people, and marriages with them forbidden. The trades that were filled by outcasts included executioners, butchers, tanners, and morticians.

==Religion==
There were two major religions in Kozakura: the [[Eight Million Gods]] and the [[Way of Enlightenment]]. The former was a collection of ancient practices native to Kozakura devoted to a variety of nature spirits, and the latter was a religious practice brought from Shou Lung and devoted to guiding its practitioners to spiritual perfection.

It was normal for a Kozakuran to recognize and participate in more than one religion, shrine, or school of thought. Those who dedicated themselves to the pursuits of only one religion tended to be priests, monks, [[shukenja]], and [[sohei]].

The [[korobokuru]] of Kozakura worshiped a pantheon of animal spirits. Sometimes, their heroes were elevated mythically to the state of half-animalistic demigods.

==History==
The early history of Kozakura is largely fogged by mythology and origin legends of the Eight Million Gods.

{{YearlinkConvert|1|KY}} was marked by the ascent of Emperor [[Mori]] of the [[Akimatsu family]] to the position of Emperor.  His claim to the throne was said to be supported by the gods in displays of divine power. He made his claim based on the support of many of the other families, which had been won through military might and a system of diplomacy that was largely based on strategic weddings of Akimatsu family women into other clans. Emperor Mori originally held court and centered his government in the city of [[Fukama]], in [[Shizume Province]], home to the ancestral lands of the Akimatsu family.

As time went on, the Akmitasu Emperors took control over the fertile [[Dai Plain]] in [[Kodo Province]] in order to better maintain the position of emperor—this plain was one of the largest rice-producing regions in the Kozakuran islands. They continued the tradition of intermarriage with other clans in order to cement their power, and in {{YearlinkConvert|514|KY}}, they moved the imperial capital to [[Dojyu]] on the Dai Plain in order to have a closer economic foundation for their power base.

As a result of the constant expansion of the Akimatsu family, eventually several branches split from the Imperial line. Most of these cousins sought to control the Emperor through marriage to one of their own daughters, and attempting to manipulate succession to put a child emperor on the throne. In these cases, the regent to the Emperor (''sessho'') could often take power over the court by controlling appointments, land grants, and taxation. The [[Honda clan]] proved to be the most successful at this manipulation and they effectively ran the country through this system of sessho until {{YearlinkConvert|1119|KY}}.

Over the course of Imperial power, provinces grew more isolated and uncontrolled by the central authority and the landowning families far from court tended to fend for themselves, as help from Doyju took a long time to get and then to arrive. As a result, the provincial families funded their own soldiers for protection and tax collection, and developed an independent attitude. This led to the growth of a military class, and the fact that many landholding lords developed their own private armies (and fighting skills) contributed to decline in influence of the Akimatsu emperors.

The [[Tennu war]] began in {{YearlinkConvert|1108|KY}}. In {{YearlinkConvert|1119|KY}}, when the dust had settled, it was the [[Hojo clan|Hojo family]] who emerged as the most powerful. Seizing their opportunity, they forced Emperor [[Showaji]] to grant their family head [[Hojo Tademashi]] the title of shogun, or great warlord. From this point on, the real power in Kozakura lay with this military leader, though the Emperor continued to hold his position.

In {{YearlinkConvert|1120|KY}}, the Shogun set up an alternate government center called the bakufu in the city of [[Gifu]].  While technically still inferior to the emperor, the shogun controlled the military. He still maintained a careful pretense of obedience to the will of the emperor, however, because the common folk believed in the Emperor's divine right to rule.

The office of Shogun became hereditary in {{YearlinkConvert|1242|KY}} under the rule of Emperor [[Ijo]]. Unfortunately, this led to the same kind of political maneuvering and machinations that haunted the Imperial Line eight centuries before.

===Modern History===
====The Hojo War====
In {{YearlinkConvert|1415|KY}}, Shogun [[Hojo Kikutake]] died in a horse-riding accident, aged 37, sparking a succession crisis. His seventeen-year-old son, [[Hojo Todahiro]], was only a year shy of the legal age at which he might inherit, 18, requiring him to have a regent, or shikken. Moreover, Todahiro's own two-year-son, [[Hojo Kawabuko]], should be chosen as shogun, would require a regent for many more years. Supporters of the Hojo family argued about which Hojo to choose for shogun and whom the regent should be, and the great families of Kozakura split over these questions.

The ensuring [[Hojo War]] was fought between {{YearlinkConvert|1415|KY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|1421|KY}} to determine who would succeed to the shogun's throne.<ref group="note">While ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'' Volume II and other sources frame the Hojo War as between two Hojo claimants, ''Night of the Seven Swords'' presents it as between Hojo and Takenaka. As such, it has families support a Hojo without specifying which. Since Takenaka supports Hojo Kawabuko, it is presumed the Hojo side is ojo Todahiro.

Finally, Hojo Todahiro and his faction lost at the [[Battle of Norinoshima]] in {{YearlinkConvert|1421|KY}}. The Michimori acted as mediators between the victorious Takenaka and the remaining Todahiro-supporting lords in the north; this saved the Michimori from being destroyed themselves. During the conflict, [[Takenaka Sugawara]], half-brother of Okawa, distinguished himself as a talented and popular general of the pro-Kawabuko faction, but, as he had no blood ties to the position, was overlooked for the role of shikken. Thus, those families who preferred Sugawara to Okawa were alienated and unhappy instead and caused a new split in the Takenaka clan and their allies: the southwestern branch supporting Okawa from the Fukudo, Naga-ido, and Naredo Provinces, and the northwestern branch supporting Sugawara from the Dosaki, Iwari, and Sanyo Provinces.

====An Uneasy Peace====
The [[Niwa]] family were appointed as shugu-daimyos of Miyama province in {{YearlinkConvert|1423|KY}} and the Korimori as shugo-daimyos of Maeshi province. However, they could not gain full control of the province, owing to the Michimori's continuing power and influence there and the Korimori's own lateness in coming to the Takenaka's side in the Hojo War.

In {{YearlinkConvert|1424|KY}} or {{YearlinkConvert|1425|KY}}, [[Gonijo]] became Emperor of Kozakura, at age 15. That year, Niwa troops razed the village of [[Anan]] in Miyama Province.

Then [[Michimori Sado]], son of the family head [[Michimori Uemon]], died mysteriously in {{YearlinkConvert|1426|KY}}, believed to have been murdered by members of the Korimori family. The shogunate permitted Sado's brother to seek revenge against the Korimori. This caused a blood feud between the two families and shattered the already tenuous peace that had held since the Hojo War.

Thus, a decade since the war, Takenaka Okawa had neither united Kozakura nor weakened his enemies and rivals sufficiently. As of {{YearlinkConvert|1430|KY}}, with Kawabuko now aged 17 and soon to take power as shogun and Okawa due to retire as shikken, tension and turbulence were growing.

===Post-Spellplague===
The [[Spellplague]] of {{YearlinkConvert|1459|KY}} was as catastrophic in Kozakura and Shou Lung as it was in Faerûn. It caused many to migrate west, into the Hordelands and even Faerûn.<ref>

Following the Spellplague, Kozakura became embroiled in a civil war.{{cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|4}} This conflict was encouraged by the [[Iridescent Peacock Society]], a mercenary cabal of [[wu jen]] that profited by selling their services to those who paid the most.<ref>{{cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|6}} It led to opposing factions, out-of-control brigandry, and ronin armies. Most [[hengeyokai]] and [[spirit folk]] stayed out of the fighting, either going further into the wilds or escaping to [[Shou Lung]], where [[Sheng Ti]] province, via the port of [[Lo'Shan]], was seen as a sanctuary.<ref>{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|2}} Nevertheless, a dedicated few worked to protect the common people from marauders and bandits. Notably, the [[monkey hengeyokai]] martial artist [[Aoi]] fought alone to defend seven villages from a 100-strong ronin army, making her a hero in southwestern Shinkoku. The civil war had faded by {{YearlinkConvert|1553|KY}}.
