Boyd is credited as an author on both Races of Faerun and Champions of Valor, where glassteel as a material is introduced both to 3rd edition and to 3.5, the inclusion of the spell can only be considered deliberate.Upon inquiry, a detail provided by George Krashos on Candlekeep, and confirmed by Eric L.

Thus, this information is accepted, with this note added to explain at length the caveat that it is unpublished material.\nTrobriands glassteel was a spell that hardened materialsThough no mention is made of the spell rendering the substance clearer, chalcedony is translucid at best, not transparent in nature the Vanrakdoom examples are explicitly transparent. It is assumed in this article that the spell modifying the look of chalcedony is more likely than a naturally transparent chalcedony. It was akin to glassteel.\nMaterials affected by the spell were hardened to the strength of iron or steel, likely also made more transparent.\nPer records from sages familiar with the matter, the spell was akin to glassteel and possessed both verbal and somatic components, as well as requiring a small piece of iron as its material component.\nThe spell was ostensibly developed by Trobriand.
