        "mainbody": "ch details can be considered otherwise foregone conclusions, given the fact that the spell's effect is to alter properties, traditionally the province of transmutation, and its clear similarities with [[glassteel (spell)]] in 1st and 2nd edition.<br>Furthermore, Boyd explicitly states his intent to recreate ''glassteel'', further confirming that the spell is intended to behave similarly to ''glassteel''.
