Sequester was a transmutation spell that hid a willing creature or an object.
A willing creature or an object, when touched by the caster, became invisible and undetectable by scrying methods until the effect was dispelled, or until a condition determined by the caster was met.
In addition, while the spell was in effect, a creature sequestered by it ceased to age and was suspended in a state of frozen time.
The spell required verbal, somatic and material components. The material required was a powder made of 5000 gp worth of pulverized diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire, which was consumed by casting the spell.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Enollar in  and was originally known as Enollars isolation.
