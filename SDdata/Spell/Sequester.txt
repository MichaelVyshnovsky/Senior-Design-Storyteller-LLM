'''''Sequester''''' was a [[transmutation]] spell that hid a willing creature or an object.

==Effects==
A willing creature or an object, when touched by the caster, became invisible and undetectable by [[Scry|scrying]] methods until the effect was dispelled, or until a condition determined by the caster was met.

In addition, while the spell was in effect, a creature sequestered by it ceased to age and was suspended in a state of frozen time.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]] and material components. The material required was a powder made of 5000 [[gp]] worth of pulverized [[diamond]], [[emerald]], [[ruby]], and [[sapphire]], which was consumed by casting the spell.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Enollar]] in {{Yearlink|-1614}} and was originally known as ''Enollar's isolation''.
