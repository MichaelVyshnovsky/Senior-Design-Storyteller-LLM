        "mainbody": "'''''Frigid blade''''' is a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] used by [[swordmage]]s, particularly those who prefer to use fire and ice together in their spells. When a swordmage casts ''frigid blade'' they fill their weapon with icy power, freezing the flesh of its target and the air around it. When used on a creature, this causes the said creature to slow down substantially, the exact percentage dependent upon how durable the swordmage's own flesh is. This effect only lasts a brief moment, though ''frigid blade'' can be recast at will and the power of the spell increases with the swordmage's own.",
