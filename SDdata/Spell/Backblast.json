        "mainbody": "Backblast was an abjuration spell that was first developed by the phaerimms.\nWhen cast, this spell surrounded the caster or target creature with an invisible aura. If the individual was targeted by a fire-based spell, that spell was automatically thrown back to the source. Distance was not a limiting factor with this spell, so if the targeted creature was struck by a time-delayed fire-based spell, such as delayed blast fireball, the fireball was sent back to the person who cast it, even if they have left the area. Dispel magic was able to cancel this spell. This spell only protected a single creature at a time. \nThis spell required only a verbal component.\nIt was stolen by magic-users of other races and could later be found in many spellbooks across Faer√ªn."
