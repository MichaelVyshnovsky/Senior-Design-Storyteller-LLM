        "mainbody": "'''''Breath of life''''' was a [[necromancy]] spell that allowed the caster to cure nonmagical diseases in many people over a wide area. The reverse of this spell, '''''breath of death''''' could infect people in a large area with a fatal disease.",
        "Effects": "The caster had to pick a particular disease when casting this spell&mdash;only one disease could be cured at a time. Natural diseases could be cured, but not magically created disease, parasites, [[rot grub]]s, [[green slime]], [[lycanthropy]], etc. Once cured, this spell did not prevent recurrence of a disease due to re-exposure.\n\nThe area covered by this spell was centered on the caster, who had to remain in one place for the 10 minutes it took to cast ''breath of life''. He or she exhaled a pleasant-smelling breath that formed a gently swirling breeze that was unaffected by wind or weather. The ''breath of life'' expanded in a circle, increasing in diameter by 300 ft (91 m) every hour, for an hour per experience level of the priest. This magical zephyr instantly cured the chosen disease in everyone it touched.\n\nWhen cast in reverse, the ''breath of death'' was a foul-smelling miasma that crept outward, infecting all those who could not resist its [[death magic]] with the chosen, nonmagical disease. Infected victims could not heal wounds either naturally or by magical ''cure'' spells, and would die in one to six weeks unless the disease was ''[[remove disease|removed]]'' or otherwise cured.",
        "Components": "As part of the verbal component, the priest had to utter the name of the disease to be cured or inflicted. The somatic component included exhaling the ''breath''. The material component for ''breath of life'' was burning incense that had been blessed by the highest priest of the caster's religion. ''Breath of death'' required a handful of dust taken from the corpse of a [[mummy]].",
        "History": "This spell was inscribed within the [[Kelemvor]]ite [[relic]] the ''[[Testament of Vraer]]''. and in ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy text of the [[church of Mielikki]].<ref>"
