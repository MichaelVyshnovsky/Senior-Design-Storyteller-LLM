Ecdysis was a divine alteration spell from the animal sphere that rapidly accelerated a dragons molting process.
This spell was only effective against living dragons, dragonets, dragon turtles, dracohydrae, and draconic hybrids. A target affected by ecdysis began to rapidly shed their scales, becoming more vulnerable with each passing minute. The shed scales turned to dust quickly so could not be gathered for spellcasting purposes. The spells effects could be stopped, but not reversed, by dispel magic, remove curse, and cure disease. The dragons recovery could be accelerated by heal, wish, and limited wish, otherwise the dragon would regrow their scales naturally at a rate of ten percent per day.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a scale from any reptile to cast.
This spell was only granted to dragons by Null, the Death Wyrm.
