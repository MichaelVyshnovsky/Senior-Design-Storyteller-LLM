        "mainbody": "Sharpen was an uncommon spell known to hedge wizards and artificers.\nThe spell sharpened and straightened a blade, removing nicks and dents along the edge. It did not provide any additional combat advantage beyond that of regular maintenance.\nThe spell called for verbal and somatic components only.\nAn enterprising hedge mage had developed the spell."
