Exaltation was a spell used by Helmite priests to protect others.
When cast, the spell removed a negative effect from a single other being. The touched being would be stripped of hunger, pain, nausea, intoxication, insanity, unconsciousness, and feeblemindedness, as well as the effects of the fear and sleep spells. For the rest of the spells duration, the recipient would be protected against effects that caused such conditions. This duration scaled with the power of the priest.
Beings of a different alignment or faith had a reduced chance of gaining the effects of exaltation. Those of the same alignment and faith automatically gained the effects, had their morale raised, and glowed in a white, blue, or amber light.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material components were a vessel of holy water and a powdered sapphire or diamond worth at least 1000 gp.
Exaltation was found in the 27-spell tome known as the Hand of Helm.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , Chief Prelate Dayspring of the Clerical Circle of Ravens Bluff declared it illegal for priests to cast exaltation within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm, threatening arrest for those that broke this decree.
