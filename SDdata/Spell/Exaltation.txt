'''''Exaltation''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[Helmite]] [[priest]]s to protect others.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell removed a negative effect from a single other being. The touched being would be stripped of hunger, pain, nausea, intoxication, insanity, unconsciousness, and feeblemindedness, as well as the effects of the ''[[fear]]'' and ''[[sleep]]'' spells. For the rest of the spell's duration, the recipient would be protected against effects that caused such conditions. This duration scaled with the power of the priest.

Beings of a different alignment or faith had a reduced chance of gaining the effects of ''exaltation''. Those of the same alignment and faith automatically gained the effects, had their morale raised, and glowed in a white, blue, or amber light.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material components were a vessel of [[holy water]] and a powdered [[sapphire]] or [[diamond]] worth at least 1000 [[gp]].

==History==
''Exaltation'' was found in the 27-spell tome known as the ''[[Hand of Helm]]''.{{Cite dragon/164/Pages From the Mages, Part VI|62}}

In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, [[Chief Prelate]] [[Relarn Dayspring|Dayspring]] of the [[Clerical Circle]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] declared it illegal for priests to cast ''exaltation'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]], threatening arrest for those that broke this decree.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}
