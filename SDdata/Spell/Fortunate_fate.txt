'''''Fortunate fate''''' was a powerful [[divine]] [[spell]] that was used to save an individual's life in times of peril. It was used by [[cleric]]s of the [[Church of Tymora|Tymoran faith]].

==Effects==
By casting ''fortunate fate'', a [[Tymora]]n cleric placed a contingent, protective aura upon a single living being. If that individual was harmed to the point they would die, the aura activated and healed them of any damage or ill effects. The recipient would not even lose consciousness and were rid of any [[disease]]s, harmful parasites, and ''[[charm]]'' effects that had been placed upon them.

The spell failed if it was cast upon an [[evil]] person or creature.

==History==
Throughout history, Tymoran clergy members were directed to only cast ''fortunate fate'' upon those who shared the moral outlook and guiding principles that the faith held. It was considered sacrilegious to bestow the spell's aura upon anyone else, unless they were championing Tymora's cause or aiding her servants.

Periodically, some Tymoran priests have cast ''fortunate fate'' on certain "unworthy" individuals for a hefty donation to their temples. This amount was typically greater than 100,000 [[gp]].

The specifications of this spell appeared upon the ''[[Flame of the Spirit]]'' when it assumed its tablet form.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast.
