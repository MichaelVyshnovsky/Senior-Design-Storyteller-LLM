        "Effects": "This spell functioned exactly like ''[[detect evil]]'' except it detected good auras from [[paladin]]s, good clerics, spells, magic items, etc. Just as poison did not show up as evil, beneficial potions did not register as good.",
        "History": "The arcane version of the ''[[detect evil]]''/''detect good'' spell was invented by [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Trebbe]] in {{Yearlink|-2238}} under the name ''Trebbe's scry evil''/'''''Trebbe's scry good'''''.Only the primary form is named in the source. The name of the reversed form, ''Trebbe's scry good'', is chosen in analogy."
