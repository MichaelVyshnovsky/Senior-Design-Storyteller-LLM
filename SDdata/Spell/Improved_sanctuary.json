        "mainbody": "Improved sanctuary was a spell used by clerics of Cyrrollalee.\nWhen cast, an area with a  radius around the caster had the effect of a sanctuary spell. The effects of the spell only affected creatures friendly to the caster. Anyone protected by the spell could not attack an enemy, if so the effects of the spell no longer protected said individual.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Cyrrollalee and a small mirror made from silver."
