Create enchanted tattoo was an arcane alteration spell that allowed the caster to place enchanted tattoos on the targets body.
Each casting of this spell placed a single enchanted tattoo on the targets body, but up to three tattoos could be created on a single target provided they bestowed different enchantments. The enchantments bestowed by the tattoo were determined by the casters skill. Each tattoo lasted for several days depending on the casters skill as well.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a target body to cast. Additionally, the caster needed to possess artistic skill to draw the tattoo.
This spell was used exclusively by Red Wizards from Thay.
