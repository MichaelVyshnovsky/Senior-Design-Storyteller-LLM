        "mainbody": "'''''Purify wine''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] used by [[Lliiran]] [[priest]]s who committed themselves to [[wine]] production.",
        "Effects": "When the spell was cast, it clarified the target container of up to three gallons of wine, removing all sediment and impurities. The spell's effects were permanent and the target had to be within one yard of the caster. ''Purify wine'' was a reversible spell and could be cast to cloud and create impurities within targeted container of wine. The volume that could be clarified increased with the [[cleric]] magical proficiencies.",
        "Components": "''Purify wine'' required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s to be cast. The spell's material component was a clear [[glass]] ball. The reverse spell's material component was a smoky-colored glass ball.",
        "History": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], ''purify wine'' and ''age wine'' spells were used by the [[hin]] winemakers and priests of [[Lliira]] [[Jolly Greenleaf]] and [[Brandywine Furfoot]] of [[Ravens Bluff]]. Jolly committed his life to the art of winemaking and ran [[As the Vine Twines]] winery in the Bluff. Cleric Greenleaf learned of the Lliiran divine magic that helped with the production of wine from [[France]], a traveling cleric of Lliira, soon after the halfling found himself in Ravens Bluff."
