'''''Find greater steed''''' was a powerful [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[paladin]] to summon a spirit to take the form of an impressive steed.

==Effects==
The spell was similar to ''[[find steed]]'', in that it called forth a [[celestial]], [[fey]], or [[fiend]]ish spirit to assume the form of a loyal and intelligent steed. However, the spell granted additional forms that the spirit could take, including [[dire wolf]], [[griffon]], [[pegasus]], [[peryton]], [[rhinoceros]], and [[dire tiger|saber-toothed tiger]].

The steed could communicate verbally and telepathically with the paladin out to a range of {{SI|1|mi|k|long=yes}}. Spells that normally targeted only the paladin could be made to affect the mount as well. Killing the mount only caused it to disappear temporarily; another casting of the spell was sufficient for the mount to return unharmed. The paladin could also release the spirit from the bond by voluntarily dismissing the mount. As with ''find steed'', only one mount could be kept at any time, by either spell.

==Components==
The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
