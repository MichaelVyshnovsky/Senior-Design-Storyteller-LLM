After casting, it became very difficult for detection and divination spells to detect the targeted individual or object. The targeted creature's equipment was also protected. The spell also successfully prevented magical items such as ''[[crystal ball]]s'' from targeting the subject of the spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], some [[diamond]] dust with a value of at least 50 [[gp]].",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Ptack]] in {{Yearlink|-502}} and was originally called ''Ptack's nonscryance''."
