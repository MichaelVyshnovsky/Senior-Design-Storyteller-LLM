Lesser distraction was a common spell used by ninjas. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
Ninja used this spell to distract a target. The target of the spell saw an ill-defined image on the periphery of their vision or heard an imperceptible noise. The ninja was able to choose on casting whether the spell would be auditory- or visual-based, but was unable to control how the spell manifested or the distance.
The spell required only a somatic component, kuji-kiri hand gestures.
