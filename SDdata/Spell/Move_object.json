        "mainbody": "Move object was an uncommon alteration spell of the southern magic tradition. It was popular with mentalists.\nWhen cast, the caster was able to move a single small object, within 10 yard (9 meter). The casters skill level determined how heavy the object could be. The spell was unable to perform complex movements nor could it animate objects.\nThe spell only required a somatic component."
