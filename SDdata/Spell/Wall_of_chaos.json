        "mainbody": "Wall of chaos was a spell similar to magic circle against law.\nWhen cast, this spell created a spherical or linear barrier. One side of the barrier is designated as a safe zone by the caster. The barrier prevented lawful creatures and their attacks from reaching the caster and anyone else on the other side of the barrier. The spell worked against conjured and summoned lawful creatures. The barrier had to have enough space to be unbroken, if during casting a creature or object was in the way, the spell failed.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
