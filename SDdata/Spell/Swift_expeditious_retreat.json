While both spells increased the speed of the caster, the effects of swift expeditious retreat lasted only six seconds, compared to minutes for expeditious retreat. The swift version of the spell could be cast in only moments, and the caster spoke the words in a breathless voice, as if out of breath from running.\nUnlike expeditious retreat, this spell only required a verbal component."
