        "mainbody": "'''''Glassteel''''', originally '''''Proctiv's steely glass''''', was a [[spell]] that reinforced glass and crystal.",
        "Effects": "When cast upon normal, nonmagical glass or crystal, the spell altered their structures into a transparent substance with steel-like strength: a [[glassteeled]] material. The maximum weight to be affected by a single casting was typically no more than {{SI|160|pounds|k|long=yes}}, though some casters managed a bit more.",
        "Components": "Beyond [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s, the [[material component]] of the spell was small pieces of glass and [[steel]].",
        "History": "The spell was developed by [[Proctiv]] in {{yearlink|-2090}} and was originally named ''Proctiv's steely glass''.\n\nThe spell was largely unknown by {{yearlink|1372}}, when alchemically synthesized and superior [[glassteel]] was more widely utilized in equipment,{{cite book/Champions of Valor|65}} and hardening techniques with broader application were available.",
        "Variants": "*Rare members of the [[Night Parade]] had the power to invoke an ability akin to this spell.\n*[[Dwarf]] [[clerics]] of sufficient power could invoke the ''Bhelaerak'' [[rune of power]] for a similar effect.{{cite book/Dwarves Deep|42}}"
