        "mainbody": "Melfs acid arrow, sometimes simply called acid arrow, was an arcane conjuration spell that propelled an arrow of acid from the casters hand that continued to corrode what it struck.\nAfter the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, the caster launched a single arrow of acid from their hand. It had an effective range of over 440 feet (130 meters). If it struck the target, only it was harmed by the acid. For more experienced mages, the acid lingered and continued to burn for an increasing length of time until it was neutralized or the effect expired.\nAfter the Spellplague of 1385 DR, the spell created a shimmering arrow made of a green, glowing liquid. It exploded on contact with its target, burning it and spraying sizzling acid over adjacent creatures to slightly injure them as well. Even on a miss, it was still injurious. The acid continued to burn until removed.\nThe acid could damage the hulls of most spelljammers, excluding those made of ceramic or glass. As with the effect on creatures, the acid continued to damage the ship for an extended period of time.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required powdered rhubarb leaf and the stomach of an adder. It also required a dart as a spell focus.\nThis spell was one of several that could be used in the creation of acidic burst weapons.\nIn the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast Melfs acid arrow within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization."
