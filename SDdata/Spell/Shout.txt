'''''Shout''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that allowed a caster to shout devastatingly.

==Effects==
On casting ''shout'', the caster gave a shout that deafened those within a 30 ft (9 m) cone of the caster. This shout was such that it physically harmed people within its path. It was much more effective at destroying brittle objects or crystalline creatures.

==Components==
''Shout'' required only verbal components. The version circulating in the Realms before the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic]] additionally required a miniature cone of bull or ram horn as well as small amounts of [[honey]] and citric acid as [[material component]]s.

==History==
The spell was invented at the edge of [[Netheril]] in [[-764 DR|3095 NY (âˆ’764 DR)]] by the evil [[arcanist]] [[Xanad]], then consequently named '''''Xanad's shout'''''.<ref>
