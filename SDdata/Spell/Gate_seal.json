        "mainbody": "'''''Gate seal''''', also known as '''''seal portal''''', was an [[abjuration]] spell used to seal a ''[[gate]]'' or ''[[portal]]'' from interplanar travel. There were both [[Arcane magic|arcane]] and [[Divine magic|divine]] versions of this magic. The reversed form of this spell was known as '''''unseal gate'''''.",
        "Effects": "By tossing a [[silver]] [[trade bar]] at any sort of nearby magic ''portal'', the spellcaster could permanently seal it. The silver bar would briefly transform into a silver net around the portal before dissipating.\n\nThis magic was permanent, but it could be undone, either by the will of the caster or by the use of the ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell or a ''[[chime of opening]]''. The latter method would not function if the ''portal'' or ''gate'' was created by someone of great magical power. Either method permanently unsealed the ''gate''. The ''[[knock]]'' spell was never sufficiently strong enough to unseal a ''portal'' bound with this spell. \n\n''Gate seal'' also worked to stop certain other means of teleportation, such as suppressing the magic of a ''[[stone walk]]'' effect.\n\nA weaker arcane variety of this spell required only a steel bar, but the result was only a temporary blockage of transit. Such limited sealings revealed the sigil or the face of the wizard blocking the passage.",
        "Components": "In addition to the metal bars mentioned above, the spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s. A twig was required for the reversed form of the spell, which was snapped when the spell was cast.",
        "Notable Users": "[[Khelben Arunsun]] knew this spell and once used it to seal a ''portal'' in the [[Wormwrithings]] that led to tunnels beneath the city of [[Waterdeep]].{{Cite dungeon/128/Vampires of Waterdeep: The Fireplace Level|74,77}}\n\nThe limited versions of the spell, the ones requiring only a steel bar, were commonly used on the battlefields of [[Acheron]] where they prevented foes from hopping between that plane's cubes with the ''[[cubehopper]]'' spell. In such cases, the spell could be cast over the entire battlefield."
