Dire radiance, when cast, allows the warlock to call forth a shaft of brilliant, chilling light from the heavens, using it to cause excruciating pain to a creature within fifty feet. If the creature attempts to approach the warlock, the beam intensifies, causing even greater pain. The potency of dire radiance is largely determined by the constitution of the warlock casting it and warlocks of great experience and power cast a significantly more powerful version of the spell.\n*\nCategoryWarlock spells\n9ra3lnqq6m5sugqxyuefl6dzo5j6hky"
