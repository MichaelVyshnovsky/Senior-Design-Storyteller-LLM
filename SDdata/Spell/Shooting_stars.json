        "mainbody": "hooting stars was a special divine conjuration and invocation quest spell from the combat, sun, and weather spheres that blasted an area with a number of small fireballs.\nWith this spell the caster created violent turbulence within a  radius. A number of small electrically charged fireballs bombarded the area. In addition to this, a quartet of large shooting stars appeared that could be directed by the caster to specific targets. Any creature within  of one of the targets when it was struck by a shooting star was also harmed by fire.\nThis spell did not require spell components of any kind.\nThis spell was used by druids who served Moander during the height of ancient Netherils power."
