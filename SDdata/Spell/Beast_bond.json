        "mainbody": "'''''Beast bond''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] that forged a temporary telepathic bond between the caster and an [[animal]].",
        "Effects": "By touching a non-hostile beast, either already friendly or rendered docile through the use of other [[magic]], the spell created a link that lasted for up to 10 minutes, as long as the caster kept concentrating and the beast remained within line of sight. A connected animal could understand basic telepathic messages and commands, and could send basic emotions back. The affected creature was also more competent at protecting the caster. The spell did not work on particularly intelligent animals.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was a bit of fur wrapped in cloth."
