Celebration was a spell used by bards.
During casting, the caster sang a drinking song. Any creature within  of the caster began to feel intoxicated. The longer they were within the range of the spell the worse it got. The effects persisted for a while even after the spell expired or if a creature left the area. If a creature entered within the area they were not afflicted with intoxication.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
