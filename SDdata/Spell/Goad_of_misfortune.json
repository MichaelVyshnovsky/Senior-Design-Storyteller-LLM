        "mainbody": "'''''Goad of misfortune''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a metal bullhook in the hands of the caster.",
        "Effects": "When this spell was cast, it created a 4-foot-long (1.2 meters), non-bladed [[elephant]] goad. When wielded as a weapon by the casting [[cleric]], the goad was particularly damaging when used to deliberately attack items. Additionally, it allowed the wielder to ''[[dimension door]]'' when they struck a person or creature, up to three times in rapid succession.\n\nThere was another version of the spell that created a ''goad of misfortune'' that remained suspended in midair. This ''goad'' struck any person or creature that wandered nearby, without the added ''dimension door'' or item-destroying properties.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required an [[iron]] bar that was consumed during casting.",
        "History": "The specifications of this spell were found in the [[Beshaba]]n [[relic]], ''[[the Black Book]]''."
