        "mainbody": "'''''Poison''''' was a type of [[giant]] rune that allowed the caster to detect [[poison]] in liquids.",
        "Effects": "If an inscribed vessel came into contact with any form of poison it would instantly burst and shatter, thereby alerting those nearby to the poison's presence.",
        "Components": "Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to four hours. The rune needed to be inscribed upon a liquid-bearing vessel, such as a plate, dish, bowl, [[mug]], or glass.",
        "Usage": "The '''poison''' rune was known to be used extensively by many giant leaders, as they wanted to remain vigilant against any chance of treachery."
