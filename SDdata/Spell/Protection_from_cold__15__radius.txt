Protection from cold, 15 radius was a spell used by the Red Wizards of Thay.
When cast, this spell protected the caster from all forms of cold, both mundane and magical. It created a small area of protection around the caster, 15 feet (4.5 meters) in radius. This protected area moved with the caster. This spell was nearly identical to resist cold.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a smouldering ember.
