Jims glowing coin was an enchantment spell that distracted a number of creatures within range, making them slow to react and worse at perceiving their surroundings.
The caster tossed a coin to a point within a range of 60 feet (18 meters). The coin then started to glow in a way similar to the light spell, distracting creatures of the casters choice within 30 feet (9.1 meters) of the coin for 1 minute, without requiring the caster to keep concentrating on the spell. Creatures distracted this way had difficulty spotting hidden opponents and were slow to react at the start of a combat.
The spell required somatic, material, and royalty components of 2 gp. The material required was the coin used as the focus of the distraction.
The spell was attributed to the wizard Jim Darkmagic.
