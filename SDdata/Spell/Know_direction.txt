Know direction was a divination spell that allowed the caster to immediately know which direction was north.
This spell worked in any environment (underground, underwater, in darkness, etc.) that had a distinguishable north direction. Infinite or self-contained planes might not have a north, for example.
The cantrip/orison version of this spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast. The older version of this spell required a scrap of parchment from a map that was approximately 100 years in age or older.
