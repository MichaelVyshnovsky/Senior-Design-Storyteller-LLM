'''''Know direction''''' was a [[divination]] spell that allowed the caster to immediately know which direction was north.

==Effects==
This spell worked in any environment (underground, underwater, in ''[[darkness]]'', etc.) that had a distinguishable north direction. Infinite or [[planar traits#Shape and Size|self-contained]] [[planes]] might not have a north, for example.

==Components==
The [[cantrip]]/[[orison]] version of this spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components to cast. The older version of this spell required a scrap of parchment from a [[map]] that was approximately 100 years in age or older.
