        "mainbody": "mprisonment was a type of giant rune that created a barrier in doorways and portals.\nOnce activated, this rune made it impossible for creatures to leave through its inscribed door or portal by mundane means. However, creatures could still enter these barriers and they could be bypassed by translocation spells, such as teleport and dimension door. The runes effect lasted for a duration of days equal to that of the casters level.\nIf the imprisoned creature spoke the imprisonment runes associated \"freedom word\" then its effect would fade.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune triumph. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to twelve days and it needed to be inscribed upon a door or portal.\nFinally, in order for an imprisonment rune to function a \"freedom word\" needed to be incorporated during the shaping process. This word had to be something that the imprisoned creature would know and it needed to be appropriate to the reason for imprisonment."
