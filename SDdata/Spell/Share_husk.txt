'''''Share husk''''' was, prior to the [[Spellplague]], a [[divination]] [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s. Following the Spellplague, it became an exploration [[ritual]].

==Effects==
''Share husk'' granted the caster the ability to utilize an animal's senses of sight, smell, and hearing. For this spell to work the caster and subject animal needed to be on the same plane of existence.

Following the Spellplague, the general effects of ''share husk'' remained largely the same, though with some notable differences. The ritual could only be cast on [[natural creature]]s that were not hostile and they had to be present for the entirety of the ritual's casting. Once the ritual was complete the caster's [[spirit]] left their body and possessed the animal's, leaving their own body in a helpless deep sleep-like state. Once in the target creature's body the caster could perceive everything through their senses and influence them with simple commands, such as "go there" or "wait".

If either the caster's body or the possessed animal was attacked, the ritual would end and the caster's spirit would return to their body. In the latter case, this was due to threats to the animal causing their instincts to take over.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material]] component in the form of an edible treat appropriate for the animal to cast. Following the Spellplague, this material component generally cost around 150 [[gold piece]]s.
