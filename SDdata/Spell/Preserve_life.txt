Preserve life was a channel divinity power granted to clerics who chose the Life domain.
By presenting their holy symbol, the cleric could channel healing energy to cure the wounds of badly hurt creatures in their vicinity. This power could only heal those that were badly hurt, and could never restore a creature back to full health. As the cleric progressed and became more powerful, so did the healing provided by this power, as well as how often it could be granted.
Only the clerics holy symbol was required to evoke this power.
