'''''Obedient avalanche''''', also known by many as '''''Zajimarn's avalanche''''', was a [[conjuration]] spell of the [[creation]] subschool that called down an avalanche to bury one's foes.{{cite book/Complete Divine|170â€“171}}

==Effect==
The spell opened a rift in midair, from which poured an avalanche of snow that engulfed everyone and everything beneath it and swept outwards from that location. The avalanche crushed and froze those directly beneath it, and could even bury them in heavy snow. Further away, the impact was less, but the spreading snow shoved all aside and carried them along.

The ''obedient avalanche'' also damaged buildings and other structures, uprooted small trees and lesser plants, and turned the ground into a trail of rubble in the snow's path. It also put out all fires, whether they were natural or magical in nature.

==Users==
The ''obedient avalanche'' was formerly unique to [[cleric]]s with the [[Cold domain]], but could also be learned by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.

==History==
The spell was named for [[Zajimarn]].
