        "Effects": "This spell created a spectral mouth measuring {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} across and filled with teeth. The ''maw'' lacked a physical form and could be moved about with the caster's concentration.\n\nThe ''maw'' could be instantly destroyed if struck by a weapon physically wielded by an attacker, greatly harming the attacker in the process and ''[[feeblemind]]ing'' them if they were a spellcaster. The ''maw'' was impervious to all other attacks.\n\nWhen positioned where the caster wanted, the ''maw'' emitted a wave of purple-red light in a cylindrical ray of chaos measuring {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} in diameter and {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} long. This ray of chaos lasted for two minutes before dissipating. Anything touching the ray of chaos was subjected to the following effects:\n\n* All [[magic item]]s did not function for two to five minutes after the ray expired.\n* Spellcasters were prevented from casting spells and [[psionicist]]s were prevented from using [[psionic]]s while within the ray. After breaking contact with the ray their ability to use their lost powers depended on their willpower which became easier to regain with each passing minute.\n* All magical barriers and similar effects, including [[illusion]]s, were destroyed on contact with the ray.\n* All beings, with the exception of the caster, suffered harm from the chaotic energy of the ray. This harm was even greater for the [[undead]].",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as a [[material component]] a jawbone from any creature to cast."
