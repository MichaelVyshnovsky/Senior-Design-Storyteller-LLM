'''''Windlance''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] available to [[cleric]]s, [[specialty priest]]s, and [[druids]] that served one of the deities that were revered by the [[Emerald Enclave]] and possibly others, such as followers of [[Gwaeron Windstrom]].

==Effects==
This spell was typically used as a means of escape for spellcasters that could [[shapechange]] into a form that could fly. When invoked, the caster and any creatures in a {{SI|10|ft}} square around the caster were catapulted straight up into the air by a burst of wind. The height was chosen by the caster and could be any distance from {{SI|120|ft}} to {{SI|600|ft}}. ''Windlance'' worked in concert with the shapechanging ability of the caster, allowing them to cast the spell and change shape nearly simultaneously. Other creatures blown into the air somehow had to prevent their subsequent fall or suffer the consequences.

==Components==
This spell only required a [[verbal component]] to cast.
