'''''Juggernaut''''' was a powerful [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the school of [[evocation]] that created a gigantic being. It was a very rare spell in the Realms, but was notably used by the [[Seven Sisters]]. It bore no relation to the [[juggernaut]] construct.

==Effects==
The spell conjured a huge, genderless, naked [[humanoid]] form that rose up out of the ground, in front of but facing away from the caster. It was bald and featureless but for a mouth and its material resembled the earth from which it rose, but was it was not actually earth, but rather a manifestation of magic. The ''juggernaut'' could be up to {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} tall with a reach of {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}}.

Via silent will, the caster could direct it to move around and attack and crush targets with its fists, or to grasp and carry things, including living creatures. Beings that escaped its grasped fell from that great height. It could also hurl those it had caught.

''Juggernauts'' could utter (or rather roar) up to six words chosen by the caster (and whispered during casting), but these could not serve as triggers or spell incantations and could not even be said if they were. If within {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} of the caster, the ''juggernaut'' would attract and absorb all [[magic]] cast at the caster, and either suffer its effects or nullify those that exploded or reflected from solid surfaces. The caster could not launch spells through it. The juggernaut could not use magic like [[wand]]s, or wear [[magic item]]s like [[ring]]s.

The ''juggernaut'' would simply fade away if destroyed or when the spell ended.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a ball of clay that filled the caster's palm, a piece of string, and a [[gem]] worth at least 500 [[gp]] to cast.
