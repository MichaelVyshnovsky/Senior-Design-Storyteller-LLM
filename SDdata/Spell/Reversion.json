        "mainbody": "Reversion was a divine alteration and invocation quest spell from the time sphere that reversed specific recent events.\nThe casting priest could only use this spell on allies within , undoing all physical harm the allies received during the last ten minutes provided the ally did not die from a single sudden attack. Allies that died from several attacks from cumulative damage during this time period were restored to life.\nAny spells cast by allies during the last ten minutes were restored and could be cast again. Spell components used to cast these spells were also restored.\nCasting the reversion spell was incredibly taxing on the caster, resulting in their aging one year each time the spell was cast.\nThis spell did not require spell components of any kind to cast.\nReversion was a common spell used within the Church of Vhaeraun."
