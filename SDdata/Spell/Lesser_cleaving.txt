'''''Lesser cleaving''''' was a spell that broke barriers.

==Effects==
The spell broke any barrier created by a spell less complex than itself, even an ''[[antimagic field]]'', and similarly ''disintegrated'' any physical barriers between the caster and the target. The target had to be visible to the caster at the beginning of casting, but if it moved between the beginning and the end of the casting, the area damaged could not be what the caster first intended.

The spell dealt quite severe damage to the caster during use, and stripped another spell from their memory; if no other spells were available, it would feed on the charges of items in their possession. If there were none either, another object would lose its magical functions for a couple or so days. A caster with no other magic whatsoever available would discover themselves permanently weakened by the awesome cost of the spell.

==Components==
The spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components.

==History==
[[Azuth]] made this spell available through [[Elminster]] sometime prior to {{yearlink|1370}}.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|101}}
