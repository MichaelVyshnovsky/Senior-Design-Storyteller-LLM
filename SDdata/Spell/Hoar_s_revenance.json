        "mainbody": "Revenance was a powerful divine necromancy spell used by specialty priests devoted to Hoar called Doombringers.\nThis spell caused a corpse to rise as a revenant and seek out its killer for vengeance. This spell would only work if the killer was still alive. The caster did not have control over the risen revenant, but would only be attacked if they hindered the revenant from finding their killer. The revenant would track its target for up to six months before disintegrating.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a token important to the deceased target and the priests holy symbol to cast."
