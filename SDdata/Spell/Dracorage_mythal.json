        "mainbody": "The Dracorage mythal was a magical effect created at the end of the Time of Dragons by High mages of the Fair Folk. This High Magic effect tied a Faerûn-wide mythal to the King-Killer Star.\nThe Dracorage mythal encompassed roughly a  area where the King-Killer Star was visible over Faerûn and caused all dragon and dragon-blooded creatures to slowly become more agitated and reckless, eventually becoming little more than raging beasts, when the star was actually visible the phenomenon was known as the Rage of Dragons.\nThe mythals effects were first felt in , possibly from the work of Lady Winterflower Duskmere, though other sources placed the start of the rage in   and in . At a later date, the dragons retaliated, attacking the capstone en masse elves successfully defended the location, leaving the area littered with interminable bones millenia later, a large number of which were avariel.\nSome years prior to , Sammaster reached the mythals capstone through a portal hidden in the Novularond mountains. Though he had triggered certain effects as far back as Uktar 9 of the , it wasnt until by Hammer 1 of 1373 DR he had completed the alterations, using his own phylactery to bind the mythal itself to energies drawn from the Abyss, which would power it rather than the King-Killer Star this way, he started a continuous Rage of Dragons.\nEventually, a force of dragons led by King Tamarand, the Talons of Justice, Dorn Graybrook and the wizards of Thentia broke into the heart of the Rage and slew the guardians. Though Sammaster fought them every step of the way, his alterations, alongside the mythal itself were finally broken by Pavel Shemov on Nightal 6 of that year, ending the Rages forevermore.\nThe heart of the Rage lay within a structure of stone, raised magically, with barbicans, spires, and towers, the terrain around it littered with an incredible amount of avariel and dragon bones hidden in a rocky valley somewhere on the northernmost reaches of the Faerunian continent. The location was so far north that the days were extremely short in comparison with the nights. The area was prowled by at least one ghost dragon. Strange events littered the landscape, the product of much magic and death. There were also remains of a golem or earth elemental the local flora included lichen, bistort, coltsfoot, and spadderdock. A single portal led from a hidden citadel within the Novularonds to a passage carved into the walls of the valley, allowing for a degree of separation with the fortress housing the mythal itself.\nAs of 1373 DR, it was protected by six Tarterian dragons in service of Sammaster. The passage itself was guarded by a dragonbone golem. A ward around the citadel itself transported those who attempted to enter it instead across its whole span, also preventing anyone from teleporting inside.\nSome parts of the place had other disturbing effects and a pocket of especially virulent pocket of enchantment lay somewhere. The corrupted enchantment in the valley, when it affected Taegan sufficiently, had a similar effect to the microcosm psionic power, creating for Taegan the illusion hed always just been a highborn rake in Lyrabar with an odd compulsion to climb and jump, which he barely managed to disbelieve in time to avoid hitting the ground after falling from flight due to the illusion.\nThe dracorage mythal itself was embodied in a room within the citadel, with a silver pentacle inlaid on the ground, with black walls and ceiling on which the night sky had been depicted with gemstones a gigantic ruby traling carmelians stood in for the King-Killer Star. After Sammasters meddling in 1373, a number of portals on the rooms walls generated color flashes, which were visible from outside the room. The lich had also placed two guardians at the entrance of the room, an ironwyrm golem and a drakestone golem.\nNovels\nThe Year of Rogue Dragons (The Ruin)\nThe Year of Rogue Dragons (The Rite)\nCategoryElven High Magic\nCategoryMythals\nCategoryEpic spells\nCategoryEnchantment spells\nCategorySpells\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryElven locations\ng46c3ew5tfr6d1jha3g462jnq58yyrn"
