At a later date, the dragons retaliated, attacking the capstone en masse; elves successfully defended the location, leaving the area littered with interminable bones millenia later, a large number of which were [[avariel]].\n\nSome years prior to {{yearlink|1373}}, Sammaster reached the mythal's capstone through a portal hidden in the [[Novularond]] mountains.{{cite book/The Ruin|55|2}} Though he had triggered certain effects as far back as [[Uktar 9]] of the {{yearlinkName|1372}},{{cite book/The Rage|209|14}} it wasn't until by [[Hammer 1]] of 1373 DR he had completed the alterations, using his own [[phylactery]] to bind the mythal itself to energies drawn from the [[Abyss]], which would power it rather than the [[King-Killer Star]]:{{cite book/The Ruin|323-324|13}} this way, he started a continuous Rage of Dragons.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|153}}\n\nEventually, a force of dragons led by King [[Tamarand]], the [[Talons of Justice]], [[Dorn Graybrook]] and the wizards of [[Thentia]] broke into the heart of the Rage and slew the guardians.{{cite book/The Ruin|283|12}} Though Sammaster fought them every step of the way, his alterations, alongside the ''mythal'' itself were finally broken by [[Pavel Shemov]]{{cite book/The Ruin|330|13}} on [[Nightal 6]] of that year, ending the Rages forevermore.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|154}}<ref>",
