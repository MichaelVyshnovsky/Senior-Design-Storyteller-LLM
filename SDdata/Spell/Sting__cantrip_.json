        "mainbody": "'''''Sting''''' was a person-affecting [[cantrip]] that apprentice wizards could learn. It caused an annoying pain in a target creature that was possibly disruptive. ''Sting'' was generally used to intimidate or warn people or creatures that they should show the caster some respect.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip could target one creature within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster and, if not resisted, caused the target to experience a momentary but intense pain in a spot on their body chosen by the caster. If successfully cast on the eyes, it caused blindness. If cast on the tongue, it garbled speech. If cast on a hand, it ruined any precise manipulation of small objects, with a fifty-fifty chance to drop them. All of these effects lasted less than one minute and did no direct physical damage, but were enough to disrupt the casting of a [[spell]] if it spoiled the [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], or [[material component]] of the spell being cast.The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' reduced the range and slightly altered the duration of this spell's effects. When cast, this spell gave off a small cloud of harmless blue sparks.",
        "Components": "''Sting'' required verbal and somatic components to cast. While looking at the target creature, the caster made a buzzing sound (like ''\"bzzzt\"'') and pointed to a spot on their own body where they wished the target creature to feel pain.",
        "History": "The description of this cantrip was recorded in the spellbook known as ''[[The Alcaister]]'', along with ''[[cut]]'' and ''[[gallop]]''.The three cantrips described in [[Dragon magazine 100|''Dragon'' #100]] were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''."
