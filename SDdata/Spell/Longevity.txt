Longevity was a powerful spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
A shugenja used this spell to extend their lifespan. The aging process was slowed proportionately to the increased lifespan. The shugenja was able to cast this spell multiple times throughout their life. However, there was a serious risk involved. There was a chance the shugenja was unable to handle the shock to their system, at which time the shugenja died.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components an offering to the shugenjas deity worth at least 100 chien and a bowl of fresh peaches.
