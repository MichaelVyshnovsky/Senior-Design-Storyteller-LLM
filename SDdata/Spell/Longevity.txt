'''''Longevity''''' was a powerful [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
A shugenja used this spell to extend their lifespan. The aging process was slowed proportionately to the increased lifespan. The shugenja was able to cast this spell multiple times throughout their life. However, there was a serious risk involved. There was a chance the shugenja was unable to handle the shock to their system, at which time the shugenja died.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: an offering to the shugenja's [[deity]] worth at least 100 [[ch'ien]] and a [[bowl]] of fresh [[peach]]es.
