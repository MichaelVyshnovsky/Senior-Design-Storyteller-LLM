        "mainbody": "Cling was a  spell used by drow. It was very rarely used by other races.\nWhen cast, the spell allowed the caster or a target creature to cling to any vertical or horizontal surface. The spell was unaffected by the effects of gravity, weight, wind or the texture of the surface. Unlike spider climb, this spell did not allow for movement, but the recipient was able to perform tasks such as casting a spell or tie knots. During casting, a part of the body was chosen, and had to remain in contact with the surface. If the surface was destroyed or the recipient was struck by a heavy object, the spell expired. Otherwise, the spell was ended by uttering a command word. \nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
