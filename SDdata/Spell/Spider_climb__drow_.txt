The drow version of spider climb was an improved version of the spell spider climb,
The drow version of the spider climb spell worked mostly like the original.
The caster could target herself or other people by touching them. The recipient needed to be barefoot and barehanded to draw benefits from the spell.
Movement with this spell was silent. The hands and feet were sticky and rubble or other things weighing less than 1 pound (450 grams) could get stuck on them. This side effect made spellcasting difficult to outright impossible.
The ability to stick to a surface was not impossible to overpower. A person sticking to the surface could be torn away, although sufficient strength was required to do so.
The effects of this spell could be ended by verbal command, in the case of the caster being the recipient, or by verbal command and the caster being within a certain area, in the case of a person other than the caster being the recipient.
The unique aspect of this spell was its duration. If the caster was the recipient, the spell could be turned on and off, meaning the caster could spread out the duration of this effect at her or his own discretion and did not need to use it up in one stroke. The caster could also transfer the remaining effective time to another person by touch. People other than the caster had to use the spells duration in one stroke, however.
The spell required only somatic and verbal components.
As mentioned above, the spell was an improvement of the original, as invented by Quantoul.
