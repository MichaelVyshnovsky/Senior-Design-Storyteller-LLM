Putrefaction was an alteration spell that spoiled food and water and spread disease.
Over a specified area of effect, a matter of yards (meters) dependent on the power of the caster, the spell caused food to rot and water to spoil and could even taint holy water. Any people or creatures within the area were possibly afflicted with a flesh-rotting disease, similar to mummy rot. If left untreated, it proved fatal in a matter of months.
The casting of this spell required verbal, somatic, and material components, which included a portion of rotten meat.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
