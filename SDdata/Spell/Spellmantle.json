        "mainbody": "'''''Spellmantle''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s. This spell originated from [[Mystra]].",
        "Effects": "This spell surrounded the caster in a protective aura that protected the caster from a specific spell. Casters with more skill could select more than one specific spell for the ''spellmantle'' to protect against.\n\nIn addition to protecting the caster, the ''spellmantle'' allowed the caster to use the absorbed spell energy and redirect it toward healing or to instantly trigger a pre-selected spell upon the caster. If the selected spell was one the caster had currently memorized it did not remove that spell from the caster's memory.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast."
