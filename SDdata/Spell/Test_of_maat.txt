'''''Test of maat''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[divination]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Horus-Re]] called [[Sunhawk]]s.

==Effects==
This spell detected forms of injustice, dishonor, or disorder within a corridor {{SI|10|ft}} wide and {{SI|360|ft}} long. The spell accomplished this by determining if creatures within the area of effect were in accordance with the concept of ''maat''â€“a state of living a happy life and being at peace with the gods. Any offenses against Horus-Re were detected by the spell. If multiple people were within the area of effect then a novice Sunhawk would not be able to determine their individual readings. Intermediate or higher-ranking Sunhawks could focus on individual readings if they paused to concentrate.

Alternatively, ''test of maat'' could be used to perceive if a morally ambiguous action fell within the stricture of ''maat''. During the casting the Sunhawk would imagine a course of action taken by themselves or their companions, and the spell would signify whether or not the proposed action would violate the limits of ''maat''.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] the Sunhawk's [[holy symbol]] to cast. The holy symbol was held over their left eye with their right hand during casting.
