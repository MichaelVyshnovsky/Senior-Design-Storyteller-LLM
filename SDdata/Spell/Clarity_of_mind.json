        "mainbody": "Clarity of mind was a abjuration spell that warded against spells affecting perception.\nThe caster granted the subject the insight to defend against spells from the charm (e.g, charm monster), compulsion (e.g, dominate animal), or glamer (disguise self) subschools of magic. Clarity of mind also improved the likelihood of the target striking an opponent that had concealment from a glamer spell (such as blur and displacement).\nIt required somatic and verbal components, as well as a divine focus."
