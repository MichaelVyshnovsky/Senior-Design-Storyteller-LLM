Power word, nauseatee, was an arcane spell from the enchantment school.
The spell was able to make one target nauseated. Targets of the spell would start to move and sound like they were about to vomit. The length of the effect was dependent on the target creatures health.
The spell only worked on creatures, under a certain high degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the spellcaster.
The spell required only a verbal component, which was the uttering of the power word itself.
The spell could be learned and cast by both sorcerers and wizards.
