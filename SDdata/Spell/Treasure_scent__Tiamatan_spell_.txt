'''''Treasure scent''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[divination]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Tiamat]] called [[Wyrmkeeper]]s.

==Effects==
This spell allowed the priest to accurately detect valuable [[gems]] and metals by scent within a {{SI|20|ft}} radius. Though direct value could not be determined, the spell was so accurate that the exact type of metal or gem, their form, and the precise number of coins could be determined. The exact location was not revealed but the caster could determine if they were getting closer or further from the valuables based on their scent. Larger groups of valuable produced a stronger scent compared to smaller groups.

The [[Church of Tiamat]] demanded that any Wyrmkeeper using this spell donate 20% of any found treasure within ten days or face dire consequences. 

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal component]]s to cast.
