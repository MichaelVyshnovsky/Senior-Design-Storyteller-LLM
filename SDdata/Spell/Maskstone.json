        "mainbody": "'''''Maskstone''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Abbathor]].",
        "Effects": "By means of this spell, the caster could change the physical appearance of stone thanks to a long-term illusion. The stone itself remained physically unchanged. Subterranean beings such as [[dwarves]], [[duergar]], [[gnome]]s, and [[xorn]] could easily determine that the stone's appearance was changed by magical means. Some spells such as ''[[true seeing]]'' could also detect the alteration.\n\n'''''Reveal stone''''' was the reverse of this spell. It removed the illusion cast by ''maskstone''. It could also be used to detect hidden features such as door, cavities, or panels.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a small amount of [[sand]] and an eyelash. ''Reveal stone'' required a piece of gauze and a small piece of either [[phosphorous]] or [[iron]] filings."
