        "mainbody": "Drown was a necromancy spell that drowned the target to death.\nOn casting drown, the targets lung filled with water. Barring having a hale body that resisted its lungs being filled with water in the first place, the target fell unconscious on the spot and, if left alone, died. It was impossible for the target to get rid of the water by means of natural reactions like coughing, only the able medical help from another person could save the targets life.\nNaturally, to creatures who did not need to breathe or who could breathe in water, this spell was harmless.\nDrown required somatic and verbal components and a divine focus. The somatic component was a sign of the wave.\nMagical staves called watery grave were crafted, among others, by casting the drown spell and could be used to cast drown themselves."
