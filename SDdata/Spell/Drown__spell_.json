        "mainbody": "'''''Drown''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that drowned the target to death.",
        "Effects": "On casting ''drown'', the target's lung filled with [[water]]. Barring having a hale body that resisted its lungs being filled with water in the first place, the target fell unconscious on the spot and, if left alone, died. It was impossible for the target to get rid of the water by means of natural reactions like coughing, only the able medical help from another person could save the target's life.\n\nNaturally, to creatures who did not need to breathe or who could breathe in water, this spell was harmless.",
        "Components": "''Drown'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s and a [[divine focus]]. The somatic component was a sign of the wave.",
        "History": "[[Magic]]al staves called [[watery grave]] were crafted, among others, by casting the ''drown'' spell and could be used to cast ''drown'' themselves."
