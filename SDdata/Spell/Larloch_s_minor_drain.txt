'''Larloch's minor drain''' was an [[arcane]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that drained the life of a target creature.

==Effects==
The spell drained a small portion of life from a target creature and transferred it to the caster, healing them of any injuries they add. If they had no injuries, then they received a brief boost to their life force instead.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Larloch]] the Shadow King of [[Warlock's Crypt]], but it went on to be commonly used in [[Faer√ªn]] through the 13th and 14th centuries [[DR]].

A [[scroll]] of ''Larloch's minor drain'' was in the [[Black Wolf Temple]] in the [[Vale of Shadows]] in [[Icewind Dale]] in [[1281 DR]].

Copies of ''Larloch's minor drain'' could be bought from the [[High Hedge]] in [[Beregost]], [[Sorcerous Sundries]] in [[Baldur's Gate]],

The [[imp]] [[Cespenar]], operating from Cespenar's Forge in the [[Abyssal Fortress]], was able to combine the sword [[Foebane]] and [[Fflar's Scabbard]], such that the sword inflicted ''Larloch's minor drain'' every time it struck a foe.
