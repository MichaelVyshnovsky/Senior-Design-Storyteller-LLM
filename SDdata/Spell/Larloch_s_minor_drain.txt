Larlochs minor drain was an arcane necromancy spell that drained the life of a target creature.
The spell drained a small portion of life from a target creature and transferred it to the caster, healing them of any injuries they add. If they had no injuries, then they received a brief boost to their life force instead.
The spell was attributed to Larloch the Shadow King of Warlocks Crypt, but it went on to be commonly used in Faer√ªn through the 13th and 14th centuries DR.
A scroll of Larlochs minor drain was in the Black Wolf Temple in the Vale of Shadows in Icewind Dale in 1281 DR.
Copies of Larlochs minor drain could be bought from the High Hedge in Beregost, Sorcerous Sundries in Baldurs Gate,
The imp Cespenar, operating from Cespenars Forge in the Abyssal Fortress, was able to combine the sword Foebane and Fflars Scabbard, such that the sword inflicted Larlochs minor drain every time it struck a foe.
