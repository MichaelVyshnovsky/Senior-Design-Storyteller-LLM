Spider leap was a spell used by drow. It was very rarely used by other races.
This spell was a specialized version of dimension door. A caster used this spell to teleport themselves to a location within 30 feet (9 meters) in which a spider was seen or has touched. If several spiders are within this area, the spell randomly selects one and transport the caster there. The spell was able to pass through all physical obstructions except for water or magical barriers. The spell prevented the caster from transporting to a location too small for the caster. If the targeted spider was on a wall and the caster arrived in mid-air, the spell did not prevent the caster from falling. The spell did not influence a spider nor protected the caster. The spell was able to transport not only the caster but also their equipment, up to a limit of 500 pounds (227 kilograms). 
This spell required only a verbal component.
