Life drain was a divine necromancy spell from the necromantic sphere that allowed the caster to strengthen a targets life force at the expense of another creature.
The amount of vitality drained with this spell depended on the skill of the caster and could be used by themselves or another target. Life drain did not function upon undead in any manner.
This spell required only verbal components to cast.
