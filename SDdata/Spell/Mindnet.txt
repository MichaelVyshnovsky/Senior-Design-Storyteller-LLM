Mindnet was a divine divination and enchantment quest spell from the thought sphere that established telepathic links with other subjects.
The casting priest could connect telepathically with up to ten individuals provided they strayed no further than  from each other. Thus, a chain of communication  long could be established. The amount of time needed to cast mindnet increased based upon the number of subjects, with one minute being needed per two subjects.
Anyone linked via a mindnet gained the mental fortitude, with regards to resisting magic and similar situations, as the subject with the highest intelligence. Participants could also pool their spells, allowing other subjects to cast spells from their memory with their consent as long as the subject borrowing the spell would be able to cast it under normal circumstances. The casting priest could teleport any subject to the location of another twice every ten minutes. The mindnet would be broken the instant the casting priest stopped concentration on the spell.
This spell did not require spell components of any kind to cast.
Mindnet was commonly used by members of the Church of Vhaeraun.
