        "mainbody": "Disintegrate, originally called Aksas disintegrate, was an alteration or transmutation spell that created a thin green ray that made a creature or an object of a certain size vanish,\nOlder versions of disintegrate made the target disappear no matter if it was a creature, or magical matter, or a 1\" cubic volume of other material.\nThe newer versions spell struck and injured a target, and if killed, the ray caused the creature to disintegrate into a pile of fine dust, although any equipment was not affected. The ray could also disintegrate as much as one 10-foot-cube of nonliving matter, even objects constructed entirely of force, but it could not affect magical effects, such as a globe of invulnerability. Only one creature or object could be affected per casting.\nSome observers claimed that they could smell ozone and feel electrical charge in the air before the spell was discharged by a mage about to cast it.\nThe spell has a range of over 100 (30 m).\nThe spell required verbal, somatic and material components. In order to cast the spell, the caster had to use a lodestone and a pinch of dust.\nThe spell was invented by the Netherese arcanist Aksa the Destroyer in .\nThe wizard Parwyyd Hanifar used a disintegrate spell to destroy his own Great Door to end the threat it posed.\nWhile Teldin Moore, wearer of the Cloak of the First Pilot, was in transit from Krynnspace to Realmspace, the elf wizard Vallus Leafbower used the spell effectively in a space battle against an attacking Neogi deathspider."
