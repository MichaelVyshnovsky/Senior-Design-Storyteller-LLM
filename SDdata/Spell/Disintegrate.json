        "mainbody": "'''''Disintegrate''''', originally called '''''Aksa's disintegrate''''', was an [[alteration]] or [[transmutation]] spell that created a thin green ray that made a creature or an object of a certain size vanish,",
        "Effect": "Older versions of ''disintegrate'' made the target disappear no matter if it was a creature, or magical matter, or a 1\" cubic volume of other material.\n\nThe newer versions spell struck and injured a target, and if killed, the ray caused the creature to disintegrate into a pile of fine dust, although any equipment was not affected. The ray could also disintegrate as much as one 10-foot-cube of nonliving matter, even objects constructed entirely of force, but it could not affect magical effects, such as a ''[[globe of invulnerability]]''. Only one creature or object could be affected per casting.\n\nSome observers claimed that they could smell ozone and feel electrical charge in the air before the spell was discharged by a mage about to cast it.\n\nThe spell has a range of over 100' (30 m).",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]] and material components. In order to cast the spell, the caster had to use a lodestone and a pinch of dust.",
        "History": "The spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Aksa]] the Destroyer in {{Yearlink|-2095}}.\n\nThe [[wizard]] [[Parwyyd Hanifar]] used a ''disintegrate'' spell to destroy his own [[Great Door]] to end the threat it posed.{{Cite comic/Day of the Darkening|23}}\n\nWhile [[Teldin Moore]], wearer of the ''[[Cloak of the First Pilot]]'', was in transit from [[Krynnspace]] to [[Realmspace]], the [[elf]] wizard [[Vallus Leafbower]] used the spell effectively in a space battle against an attacking [[Neogi deathspider]]."
