'''''Unholy beast''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that reformed a creature into an evil, bestial form of itself and placed it under the control of the caster.

==Effects==
Upon casting this spell, the affected creature's face became distorted into a terrifying visage with jet-black eyes and large tusks. Bone spurs erupted through its skin or hide as its physique and limbs contorted, magnifying its strength, agility and endurance. While this ''unholy beast'' became much more dangerous, it served the caster is if it were under the effects of the spell ''[[dominate animal]]''.

The effects of this spell lasted a matter of seconds, depending on the power and experience of the caster.

==Casting==
The casting of this spell only required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
