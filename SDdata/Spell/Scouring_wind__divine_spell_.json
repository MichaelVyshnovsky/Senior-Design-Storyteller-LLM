        "mainbody": "Scouring wind was an alteration/evocation spell that strong current of air that emanated from out of the casters mouth.\nWhen this spell was cast, a cylindrical gust of wind shot out from the caster for a length of up to 900 (0.3 km). It functioned similar to a gust of wind, blowing away any vapors, dusts or lighter, non-living objects. It had no effect on living persons or creatures.\nDepending on what the casting cleric chose, a scouring wind could be used in a number of ways. Depending on the specifications, it could be used to destroy magical barriers (such as an antimagic shell or prismatic sphere), temporarily removed the magical enchantment of a shield or suit of armor, destroy mundane missiles and projectiles, negate any naturally-occurring or magically-created air flows.\nThe specifications of this spell could be found inscribed upon the Talassan relic, the Chanting Chain.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast."
