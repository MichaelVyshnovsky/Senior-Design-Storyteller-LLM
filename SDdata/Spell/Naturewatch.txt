'''''Naturewatch''''' was a [[spell]] that informed the caster how badly wounded animals or plants were.

==Effects==
This spell was identical to the ''[[deathwatch]]'' spell but was only used on animals or plants. With the power of unlife, the caster acquired a necromantic vision with which they could tell the status of living animals or plants close to death within an area of {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}}. The spell also allowed the caster to ascertain routine information about an animal or plant, such as the state of nourishment.

==Components==
This spell required only a [[somatic component]].
