        "mainbody": "Persistence was a powerful spell that allowed a caster to save a spell.\nThe spell allowed a caster to cast a spell but then delay it until needed. Although spells that rely on a duration were unable to be delayed with this spell, spells that were cast instantaneously could be held. A caster was unable to cast this spell more than once at a time. If a spell was already held by the spell, and if the caster cast a different spell, it replaces the former one. This spell could be used to increase a casters natural spell casting abilities.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, an intricately worked chalice made from crystal. The chalice has to have a value of at least 2,000 gp.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
