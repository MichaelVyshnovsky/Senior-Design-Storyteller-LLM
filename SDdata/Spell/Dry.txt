'''''Dry''''' was a useful [[cantrip]] that initiate [[wizard]]s could learn. It removed a moderate amount of moisture from a small area.

==Effects==
With this cantrip, one could remove dampness from cloth, a surface, or use it to dry a bundle of [[herb]]s. The maximum area of effect was {{SI|1|cu yd|long=yes}}.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s. The caster made a wringing motion with both hands while humming a tune.

==History==
This cantrip was described on the second page of ''[[Bowgentle's Book]]'', penned by the famous [[Bowgentle|mage from Silverymoon]].{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|30}}<ref group="note">The three cantrips described in [[Dragon magazine 97|''Dragon'' #97]] were replaced with the ''[[Cantrip (spell)|cantrip]]'' spell when the 2{{nd}}-edition ''[[Pages from the Mages]]'' was published. The ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]'' describes all the 1{{st}}-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with ''cantrip''.
