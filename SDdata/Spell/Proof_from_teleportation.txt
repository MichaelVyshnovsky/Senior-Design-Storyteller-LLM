'''''Proof from teleportation''''', also called '''''proof against teleportation''''', was an [[abjuration]] spell that created a barrier to teleportation and dimensional travel.

==Effects==
The area protected by this spell was a sphere of radius 10 yd (9.1 m) per level of the caster that ignored impediments such as walls, floors, roofs, or other surfaces. For the duration of the spell, [[Astral Plane|Astral]] travel by means of ''[[teleport]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', ''[[teleport dead]]'', and ''[[dimension door]]'' was prevented from passing through the barrier in either direction. Use of a ''[[gate]]'' spell or other ''portal''-generating magics were also prevented unless the spell resistance of the gating person was able to overcome the power of this spell each time a ''gate'' was attempted. ''Proof from Teleportation'' lasted a minimum of 10 hours (longer for more experienced casters) and could be dropped by the caster at any time, or by a successful ''[[dispel magic]]''. Only powerful magics such as ''[[limited wish]]'' could overcome the restrictions on teleportation.

Travel by [[Ethereal Plane|Ethereal]] means, such as ''[[vanish]]'', ''[[armor of ethereality]]'', ''[[ethereal jaunt]]'', and the phasing ability of creatures like the [[phase spider]] were not prevented by this spell.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required {{SI|10|lbs|k}} of granular material such as [[sand]], salt, or sugar held in a 5 lb (2.3 kg) sack which was then dropped at the desired center of the spell effect.

==History==
This spell was published in "[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]" and became generally known to the magical community.
