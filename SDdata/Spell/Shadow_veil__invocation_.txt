Shadow veil, sometimes known as darkness, was an invocation used by some warlocks, particularly inexperienced ones, that allowed them to cloak themselves in magical darkness for a brief moment. 
This spell made the warlock more difficult to detect, allowing them to hide or vanish from sight. The spell was relatively easy to use and warlocks required only a short rest between castings in order to regain the power necessary to cast it.
