It was developed by Daltim Flamefist of Halruaa.\nThe spell functioned in all ways like the well-known Evards black tentacles To this, Daltims fiery tentacles added a blue-white flame that wreathed the writhing members, burning as well as crushing the unfortunates trapped within.\nLike Evards black tentacles, Daltims fiery tentacles required the usual verbal and somatic components and a piece of a tentacle of a giant octopus or squid.\nThe spell was developed by the Halruaan mage Daltim Flamefist sometime in the midâ€“14th century DR.\nBy 1373 DR, Daltims fiery tentacles was also known to Thebadol, a Halruaan elder."
