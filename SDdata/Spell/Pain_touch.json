        "mainbody": "Pain touch was an arcane spell from the school of necromancy that allowed a wizard to induce extreme pain with a touch.\nThe caster could affect a single target once they touched an exposed part of their skin. The wracking pain made the victim more clumsy and easier to strike in combat.\nIn addition to verbal components, this spell required as material components a needle and the finger from a burned glove to cast.\nThis spell was found within the Book of Shadows, a tome based upon the oration of the necromancer Nebt Bhakau of Zakhara."
