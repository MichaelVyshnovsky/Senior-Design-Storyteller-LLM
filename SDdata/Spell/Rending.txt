Rending was a divine spell specifically meant to destroy any kind of manufactured item or creature owned as property. It was granted by the Zakharan goddess of the untamed wild, Ragarra.
Any one mundane object created by labor or acquired by commerce was torn to pieces by unseen claws if affected by this spell. Magic items were sometimes affected, depending on their power and resistance. Living beings which were considered property, even slaves, suffered severe rending wounds from it, while free creatures were unaffected.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components in order to cast.
