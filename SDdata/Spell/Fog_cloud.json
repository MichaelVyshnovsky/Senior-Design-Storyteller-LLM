        "mainbody": "'''''Fog cloud''''', formerly known as '''''Veridon's cloud''''', was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that created a fog. A fog cloud could be stored in a small flask known as a [[vapor bottle]].",
        "Effects": "It caused a cloud of fog to emanate from the point of origin, obscuring sight and concealing those within. The cloud would dissipate as a normal fog in a strong enough wind, and could not be cast underwater.\n\nSince the spell created air along with the fog, it could be used to renew the air supply of a [[spelljammer]] that had spent too long in [[wildspace]]. Despite the temporary obscuring effect, the new air created remained even after the spell's duration.\n\n''Fog cloud'' could be cast by [[druid]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, [[wizard]]s, and [[cleric]]s who commanded the [[water domain]].\n\nWhen cast on [[Avernus]], the first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], the fog was a sickly yellow and smelled of sulfur. Faces appeared in the vapor, silently moaning and fading away.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components.",
        "History": "The spell was created by the [[arcanist]] [[Veridon]] of [[Netheril]], ruler of the enclave of [[Lathery]]. He introduced it in [[-484 DR|3375 NY (−484 DR)]] under the name ''Veridon's cloud''. It later became known simply as ''fog cloud''.\n\n''Fog cloud'' was an uncommon spell in [[Faerûn]] in the 1360s [[DR]]."
