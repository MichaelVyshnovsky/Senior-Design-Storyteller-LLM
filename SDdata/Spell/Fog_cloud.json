        "mainbody": "Fog cloud, formerly known as Veridons cloud, was a conjuration spell that created a fog. A fog cloud could be stored in a small flask known as a vapor bottle.\nIt caused a cloud of fog to emanate from the point of origin, obscuring sight and concealing those within. The cloud would dissipate as a normal fog in a strong enough wind, and could not be cast underwater.\nSince the spell created air along with the fog, it could be used to renew the air supply of a spelljammer that had spent too long in wildspace. Despite the temporary obscuring effect, the new air created remained even after the spells duration.\nFog cloud could be cast by druids, sorcerers, wizards, and clerics who commanded the water domain.\nWhen cast on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells, the fog was a sickly yellow and smelled of sulfur. Faces appeared in the vapor, silently moaning and fading away.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components.\nThe spell was created by the arcanist Veridon of Netheril, ruler of the enclave of Lathery. He introduced it in 3375 NY (−484 DR) under the name Veridons cloud. It later became known simply as fog cloud.\nFog cloud was an uncommon spell in Faerûn in the 1360s DR."
