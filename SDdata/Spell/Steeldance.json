        "mainbody": "Steeldance was an offensive wizard spell.\nThis spell created four long blades to hover in the air before the caster. The blades would attack up to four different targets as determined by the caster. They were subject to taking damage and would blink out of existence if destroyed by physical or magical attacks.\nOnce cast, the area of effect of steeldance was set, so any target moving outside of that range after the spell was cast could not be attacked by the blades. The effective range of the blades was  in any direction.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components four bladed weapons of any size smaller than the casters forearm to cast."
