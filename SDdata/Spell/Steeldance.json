They were subject to taking damage and would blink out of existence if destroyed by physical or magical attacks.\n\nOnce cast, the area of effect of ''steeldance'' was set, so any target moving outside of that range after the spell was cast could not be attacked by the blades. The effective range of the blades was {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} in any direction.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s four bladed weapons of any size smaller than the caster's forearm to cast."
