        "mainbody": "'''''Animal transfer''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] spell available to worshipers of [[Malar]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell allowed the caster to gain complete control over an animal's mind, which was suppressed for the duration of the spell. The caster had full control over the body and full uses of the animals abilities and senses. The spell did not allow a caster to take control of another individuals [[animal companion]]. \n\nWhile the spell was in effect, the caster's body remained motionless as if in a coma. Due to this vulnerability, the caster choose a safe location or had their body guarded before casting this spell. If the animal dies while the spell was in effect, the caster's mind returned to their body. If the caster's body was killed, their mind remained trapped in the animal until the animal perished of natural causes, was killed, or a ''[[wish]]'' spell was used to aid the caster.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[Verbal component|verbal]] components."
