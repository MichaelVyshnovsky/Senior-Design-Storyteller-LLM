        "mainbody": "Blood leech was an invocation realm spell, a powerful ritual that could be cast only by drawing mystical energy from the land.Blood leech is part of the \"Scions of the Desert\" setting variant from Dragon magazine 233, which combines the rules from the Birthright campaign with the Al-Qadim setting to give a framework for playing Zakharan regents. It was designed to steal a fraction of the power inherent in a persons bloodline,\nWith this spell, a small portion of the power that some Zakharans inherited from the seven followers of the Loregiver could be transferred to the caster. The victim had to be within 20 miles (32 km) and known to the caster. Blood leech could affect a person only once during their life.\nThis ritual required power from a land with a strong natural flow of magic. The caster also needed to invest materials worth 2000 gp, a pinch of bloodsilver, and some of their metaphysical power of rulership.\nBlood leech was one of the means used by the infamous yak folk of northern Zakhara to gain access to the bloodlines of the Sharit and the power they granted over the land."
