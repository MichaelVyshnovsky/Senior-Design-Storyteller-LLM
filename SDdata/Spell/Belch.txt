'''''Belch''''' was a person-affecting [[cantrip]] that beginning [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It caused a target creature to involuntarily burp.

==Effects==
This cantrip could target a creature within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the caster and cause it to burp. The target had a chance to resist the spell. If successful, they were able to stifle the reaction so it amounted to a relatively quiet hiccup. Failure meant a loud, very noticeable belch.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster pressed a hand to their own diaphragm while emitting a tiny, quiet burp.
