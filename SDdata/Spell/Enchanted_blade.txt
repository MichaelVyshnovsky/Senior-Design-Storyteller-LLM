'''''Enchanted blade''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]]. The spell was extremely rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
The spell summoned a magical [[longsword]]. The sword was very light and was covered in magical energy, constantly throwing off sparks of electricity. The sword was able to cast a bolt of energy to a target up to 30 feet (9 meters) from the wu jen. The sword was very powerful in melee combat, inflicting several times more damage than a regular sword, and was effective against creatures who were vulnerable only to magical weapons. The sword vanished when the spell expired.

If a wu jen cast this spell in the [[phlogiston]], the sword reacted with the phlogiston and lost effectiveness the longer it was summoned, and the wu jen and any creature around them would suffer damage.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: a [[silver]] rod and a small sword made of wood.
