        "mainbody": "Avoidance was an arcane abjuration and alteration spell that created a strong repulsion between the target and all other living things besides the caster.\nThis spell could only be used upon inanimate objects. Creatures attempting to touch the object found themselves halting before being able to do so. The magic of the spell would even violently throw creatures approaching too quickly.\nThe reverse of this spell, attraction, had the opposite effect, drawing creatures toward it.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a magnetized needle to cast.\nRial Potjian, a guildmaster in Ravens Bluff during the 14 century DR, memorized the avoidance spell."
