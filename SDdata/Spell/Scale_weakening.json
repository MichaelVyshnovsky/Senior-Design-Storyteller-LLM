        "mainbody": "Scale weakening was a spell used to weaken the natural armor of creatures.\nThe spell generated a dull gray ray out of the casters fingertips, which could be used to attack a creature in relatively close range. This creatures natural armor would be mitigated for several minutes. While it could dampen the impact of its natural armor down to none, it could not create new weaknesses, and neither did it have any effect on the resilience of its flesh granted due to spells that improved it.\nIn addition to somatic and verbal components, the spell called for a shed snake skin."
