Stars of Selûne was an evocation spell.
When cast, this spell created a number of sparkling stars that orbited the head of the caster, similar to ioun stones. The number of stars was determined by the casters skill level, to a maximum of five stars at once. The stars were used as a ranged weapon, with the caster launching a star, one at a time, at a target. When used against an evil-aligned caster, they were inflicted with cold damage.
This spell required verbal and somatic components.
