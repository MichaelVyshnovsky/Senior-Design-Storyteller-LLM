        "mainbody": "'''''Tap''''' was a haunting [[cantrip]] that apprentice [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It applied a pulsed magical force to a nearby surface that simulated striking with a knuckle.",
        "Effects": "This cantrip had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and produced a sound that could easily be heard by creatures with typical hearing capability that were within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the target point. The target had to be a solid surface, such as a wall, door, lid, window pane, ''etc.'', in order to produce a sound. ''Tap'' applied a quick, sharp, but gentle magical force to the target surface one to three times in quick succession, depending on the [[somatic]] gesture.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and somatic components to cast. The caster used one, two, or three fingers to pantomime knocking on a surfaceâ€”the number of fingers determined the number of raps. The verbal portion of the spell was either a magic word or a quiet imitation of a tap using the tongue against the upper palate."
