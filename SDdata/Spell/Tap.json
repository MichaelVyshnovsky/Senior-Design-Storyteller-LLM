It applied a pulsed magical force to a nearby surface that simulated striking with a knuckle.\nThis cantrip had a range of  and produced a sound that could easily be heard by creatures with typical hearing capability that were within  of the target point. The target had to be a solid surface, such as a wall, door, lid, window pane, etc., in order to produce a sound. Tap applied a quick, sharp, but gentle magical force to the target surface one to three times in quick succession, depending on the somatic gesture.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster used one, two, or three fingers to pantomime knocking on a surfaceâ€”the number of fingers determined the number of raps. The verbal portion of the spell was either a magic word or a quiet imitation of a tap using the tongue against the upper palate."
