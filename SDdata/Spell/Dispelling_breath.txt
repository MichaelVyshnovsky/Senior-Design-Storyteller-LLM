Dispelling breath was a spell used by dragons that allowed them to counter magic by using their breath.
Upon casting the spell, anyone who could not avoid the worst of the dragons breath would be targeted by a force that would strip all their ongoing magical effects, much like a dispel magic targeting them directly. Area spells were automatically targeted if the breath encompassed the spot on which they were centered. The mages power that could be brought to bear to try and counter was intermediate between dispel magic and greater dispel magic.
Besides its somatic component, dispelling breath required a breath weapon to be used alongside the casting.
