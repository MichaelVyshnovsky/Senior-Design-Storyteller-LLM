        "mainbody": "Ride the wind was an alteration spell used by wizards.\nThis spell transferred virtual weightlessness to a target selected by the caster, allowing them to float and move about on the slightest breeze. Though at the mercy of the wind for their direction and speed, the targets were able to ascend or descend at will. The targets could only cease their movement by grasping an object they passed by. Ride the wind only functioned on living creatures.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small handful of straw or a dry leaf to cast. Wind also had to be present for the spell to work."
