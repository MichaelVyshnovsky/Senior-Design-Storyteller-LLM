Coral growth was a spell that caused a small living piece of coral, the material component, to grow and shape at a rapid pace into the form the spellcaster wished. The maximum size of the growth was limited, but not so in relation to the size of the component piece.
This spell was popular for the creation of coral buildings in Halruaa as well as the establishment of underwater dwellings and cities by the aquatic races of Faerûn.
