The illusion could move up to  from the ninja. The illusion was required to face the same target as the ninja, but acted independently and able to use different weapons. If a target struck the illusion, it acted as would a person injured or killed in combat, and felt solid. Similar to the mirror image spell, the illusion caused no damage to the target. A ninja was able to summon more than one illusion, depending on their skill level. \nThe spell required only a somatic component, kuji-kiri hand gestures."
