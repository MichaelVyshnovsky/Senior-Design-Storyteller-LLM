        "mainbody": "'''''Improved mirror image''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[ninja]]s. The spell was very rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Effects": "A ninja used this spell to create a mirror image of themselves. The illusion could move up to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} from the ninja. The illusion was required to face the same target as the ninja, but acted independently and able to use different weapons. If a target struck the illusion, it acted as would a person injured or killed in combat, and felt solid. Similar to the ''[[mirror image]]'' spell, the illusion caused no damage to the target. A ninja was able to summon more than one illusion, depending on their skill level.",
        "Components": "The spell required only a [[somatic component|somatic]] component, [[kuji-kiri]] hand gestures."
