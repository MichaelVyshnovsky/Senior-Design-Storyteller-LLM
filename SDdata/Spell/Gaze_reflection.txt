Gaze reflection was a low-level and common alteration spell.
When cast, the air in front of the cast began to glitter, becoming reflective like a mirror. This disc of shimmering air moved with the caster. It protected the caster from effects and spells that relied on eye contact. The effects are instead reflected back to the target.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
The spell was invented in âˆ’1772 DR by the Netherese arcanist Niquie. It was originally called Niquies reflection.
