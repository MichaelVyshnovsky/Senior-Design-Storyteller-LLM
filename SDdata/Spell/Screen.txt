'''''Screen''''' was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that hid a three-dimensional space from vision and [[scrying]].

==Effects==
When the ''screen'' spell was cast, a volume was protected from observation and [[magic]]al scrying, such as use of the ''[[Scrying (spell)|scrying]]'' spell. Casters just powerful enough to cast the spell could protect a volume of up to a 30-ft sided cube. More powerful [[priest]]s and [[mage]]s could protect much larger volumes. In each case, the spell took ten minutes to cast, and its effects remained for a day. 

The unobservable volume would not just appear blank to the scryer, but the caster could create an illusory scene, such as the caster and a friend playing card games with a [[Talis]] deck. The scene could also depict a single soldier standing alone, but the volume could actual enclose a large army, waiting to spring upon the enemy.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Berthot]] in {{Yearlink|-1129}} and was originally known as '''''Berthot's screen'''''.

==Components==
The spell only required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s.
