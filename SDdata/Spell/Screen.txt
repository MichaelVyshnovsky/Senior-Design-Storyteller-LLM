Screen was an illusion spell that hid a three-dimensional space from vision and scrying.
When the screen spell was cast, a volume was protected from observation and magical scrying, such as use of the scrying spell. Casters just powerful enough to cast the spell could protect a volume of up to a 30-ft sided cube. More powerful priests and mages could protect much larger volumes. In each case, the spell took ten minutes to cast, and its effects remained for a day. 
The unobservable volume would not just appear blank to the scryer, but the caster could create an illusory scene, such as the caster and a friend playing card games with a Talis deck. The scene could also depict a single soldier standing alone, but the volume could actual enclose a large army, waiting to spring upon the enemy.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Berthot in  and was originally known as Berthots screen.
The spell only required somatic and verbal components.
