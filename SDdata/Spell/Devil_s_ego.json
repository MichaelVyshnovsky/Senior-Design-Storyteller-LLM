        "mainbody": "Devils ego was a transmutation spell.\nOn casting devils ego, the casters force of personality was magically enhanced for an extended period of time. Furthermore, this spell turned the caster into an outsider where spells cast on him or her were concerned. For example, the caster became effectively immune to charm person. However, the increase in strength of personality did not translate to additional magical power in the form of increased frequency to cast spells, although it made existing spells stronger.\nThe casting of devils ego required somatic and verbal components.\nThe only known way to obtain devils ego was through the Diabolic domain, a suit of spells that was not granted by all infernal entities."
