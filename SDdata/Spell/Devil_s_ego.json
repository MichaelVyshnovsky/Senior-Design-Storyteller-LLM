        "mainbody": "'''''Devil's ego''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]].",
        "Effects": "On casting ''devil's ego'', the caster's force of personality was magically enhanced for an extended period of time. Furthermore, this spell turned the caster into an [[outsider]] where spells cast on him or her were concerned. For example, the caster became effectively immune to ''[[charm person]]''. However, the increase in strength of personality did not translate to additional magical power in the form of increased frequency to cast spells, although it made existing spells stronger.",
        "Components": "The casting of ''devil's ego'' required somatic and verbal components.",
        "History": "The only known way to obtain ''devil's ego'' was through the [[Diabolic domain]], a suit of spells that was not granted by all infernal entities."
