'''''Scent of vengeance''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Hoar]] called [[Doombringer]]s.

==Effects==
The spell allowed the caster to easily track a single target that caused offense to another being. The name of the offender was required for the spell to function. It did not work upon [[undead]] targets. Once the spell was cast at the exact location of the offense, the priest was able to track the target through any terrain including underwater and through the air. Targets could shake their pursuit by [[Teleport|teleporting]], using a [[gate]], or shifting to another plane of existence.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a small token once possessed by the quarry and the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast.
