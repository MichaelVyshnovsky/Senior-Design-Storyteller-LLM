'''''Freedom''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that released a being that was restrained in any way.

==Effects==
One chosen being in close range was liberated from any magical or mundane effect that restricted their movement, such as the spells ''[[binding]]'', ''[[entangle]]'', ''[[imprisonment]]'', ''[[maze]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[slow]]'', ''[[temporal stasis]]'', and ''[[web]]''; forms of petrification; effects that caused paralysis and stunning; and grapples and pins. For ''imprisonment'' and ''maze'', the caster needed to know the victim's name and background and cast the ''freedom'' spell at the location where they were entombed or banished into the maze.

''Freedom'' was the reversed form of the spell ''imprisonment''.

==Components==
It required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
