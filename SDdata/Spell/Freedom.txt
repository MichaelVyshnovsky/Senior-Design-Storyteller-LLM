Freedom was an abjuration spell that released a being that was restrained in any way.
One chosen being in close range was liberated from any magical or mundane effect that restricted their movement, such as the spells binding, entangle, imprisonment, maze, sleep, slow, temporal stasis, and web forms of petrification effects that caused paralysis and stunning and grapples and pins. For imprisonment and maze, the caster needed to know the victims name and background and cast the freedom spell at the location where they were entombed or banished into the maze.
Freedom was the reversed form of the spell imprisonment.
It required only verbal and somatic components.
