        "mainbody": "'''''Shadow dragon''''' was a [[spell]] that could only be cast by [[dragon]]s. It was a favored spell of [[shadow dragon]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell transformed a dragon into pure shadow. While transformed, the dragon was still able to use their [[dragon breath|breath weapon]] and cast spells. The transformed dragon was able to hide in shadow and became invisible in total darkness.\n\nWhile transformed into shadow, the dragon was immune to most magical and mundane attacks. The dragon was vulnerable to light-based spells or magical items enchanted with a light-based spell. If exposed to sunlight, the spell expired instantly and the dragon resumed it's natural form.",
        "Casting": "This spell required only a [[verbal]] component."
