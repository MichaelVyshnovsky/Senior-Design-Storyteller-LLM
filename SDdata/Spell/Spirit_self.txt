Spirit self was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, the spell allowed a wu jen to project their spirit outside their body. The body remained in a semi-awake state. The wu jens spirit was able to command their body to perform simple tasks such as walking, eating, or communicating with others. The wu jens spirit was able to cast spells, but if the spirit form cast a spell, the spirit self spell expired and the spirit returned to the body. 
Spells such as protection from spirits had an effect on the spirit form. The spirit form could be hurt, and if the body was slain, the spirit form disappeared forever. If the body moved beyond the range of the spirit, the wu jens spirit was unable to return to the body until in range once more. If the spirit did not return to the body before the spell expired, it was trapped outside the body, which was then rendered into a catatonic state. The trapped spirit was unable to cast any further spells. The only way the spirit and body could be reunited was if a shugenja cast a restore spirit spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small mandala.
