        "mainbody": "Threnody, also known as Kiaransalees song of lament, was a spell used by clerics of Kiaransalee.\nWhen cast on individuals fighting the undead, this spell manifested images and memories of fallen comrades, friends and family. Therefore they hesitated to attack due to them thinking the undead were in fact their loved ones. Individuals who have never lost someone dear to them were immune to this spell.\nThe caster sung during casting, and anyone within a  radius was affected by the effects of the spell. The effects of the spell were lifted when an individual left this area of effect.\nThis spell required only a verbal component. The spell required the caster to be at least competent at singing."
