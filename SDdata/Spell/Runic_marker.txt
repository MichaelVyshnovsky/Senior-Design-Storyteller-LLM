Runic marker was a type of conjuration spell.
When cast, this spell created a pillar of stone,  in height and  in diameter. The shape of the pillar was determined by the caster and it had to be a solid structure with no hollow spaces within. The caster could also inscribe a message of up to twenty-five characters upon the pillar.
The purpose of the stone was the it had a glyph of warding upon it. The glyph was of the blast type. In addition to the normal trigger conditions for a glyph of warding, the caster could also assign a trigger in which the glyph activated if the pillar received any damage. Once the glyph of warding was activated, the spell was complete and the pillar of stone destroyed.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a vial of blessed water.
