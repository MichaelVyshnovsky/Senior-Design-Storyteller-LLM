'''''Everchanging self''''' was a multi-[[schools of magic|school]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[cleric]] of [[Mask]] to continually change their form for a limited time.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, the [[church of Mask|Maskarran]] cleric's appearance changed significantly and repeatedly for some time. The types of alterations included increased or decreased size, different shades and textures of skin and the addition of superfluous limbs. The types of changes were beyond their control and left a great toll on their body.

This spell did not confer increased strength or improved senses, nor did it confer additional means of locomotion.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast.
