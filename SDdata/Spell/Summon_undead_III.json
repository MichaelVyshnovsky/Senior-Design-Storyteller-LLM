        "mainbody": "Summon undead III, also known as undead summoning III, was one of the series of summon undead spells available to arcane casters in the Realms.\nThis spell could summon a huge skeleton, a large zombie, or a ghoul. Usually, the skeleton of an troll or an ogre zombie were chosen. As an alternative, the spell could summon one to three large skeletons, one to three medium-sized zombies, two to five medium-sized skeletons, or two to five small zombies&mdashprovided they were all within 30 feet of each other. \nIf a ghoul was summoned, the spell was considered a chaotic spell in addition to an evil one.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a piece of bone from either a ghast, mummy or wight.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
