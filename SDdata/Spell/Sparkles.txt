Sparkles  was a conjuration spell that created a cloud of glowing, multicolored particles that would rain outward from the caster. The sparkling motes would attach and outline any living creature they landed upon and could not be removed except my magical means. They would continue to twinkle and shine for the spells duration, illuminating any invisible creatures or persons they landed upon. 
This spell was extremely popular during Halruaan festivals, where the sparkles would be released from the skyships over the celebrants in the cities.
As well as having verbal and somatic components, a pinch of ground mica was required in the casting of sparkles.
