        "mainbody": "Badger form was a spell used by clerics of Yondalla.\nWhen cast, this spell transformed the caster into a giant badger. Any clothing and equipment worn by the caster was also transformed. When in their new form, the caster retained their regular mental state and any innate magical powers, but was unable to cast any further spells. The spell ended when it expired or at the casters will.\nThis spell was often used to dig tunnels and halfing burrows. It was also used as a means of defense.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Yondalla and either a clawm a tooth or a small amount of hair from either a badger or a giant badger."
