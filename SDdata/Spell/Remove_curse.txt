'''''Remove curse''''', also known as '''''remove affliction''''', or in some instances, banish an evil presence.

==Effects==
The caster had to successfully touch the cursed creature or object to cast this spell. ''Remove curse'' was effective on most curses, but strong curses, like those on weapons and armor, were usually not permanently removed, just lifted long enough for the person afflicted with a cursed item to get rid of it.

==Components==
Only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components were required to cast this spell.

==History==
The [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Enollar]] is given the credit for the creation of this spell in {{Yearlink|-1561}}, when it was known as '''''Enollar's dispel curse'''''. It was also one of the spells available from the ''[[Balance of Belaros]]'', a holy [[relic]] of [[Tyr]].
