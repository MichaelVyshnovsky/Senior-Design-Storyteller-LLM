'''''Swordpoint''''' was a spell.

==Powers==
The spell sent a number of bladed weapons flying towards a given target. The weapons had to be thrown in the air first, not necessarily by the caster.

==History==
In {{yearlink|241}}, during the Hunt for the [[human]] [[armathor]] [[Elminster Aumar]], [[Tlannatar Wrathtree]] cast ''swordpoint'' on the orders of [[Ivran Selorn]] to attack Elminster, who somehow returned all attacks to their originators, killing most of them in one stroke.
