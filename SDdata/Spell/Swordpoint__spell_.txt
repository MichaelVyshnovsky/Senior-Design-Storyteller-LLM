Swordpoint was a spell.
The spell sent a number of bladed weapons flying towards a given target. The weapons had to be thrown in the air first, not necessarily by the caster.
In , during the Hunt for the human armathor Elminster Aumar, Tlannatar Wrathtree cast swordpoint on the orders of Ivran Selorn to attack Elminster, who somehow returned all attacks to their originators, killing most of them in one stroke.
