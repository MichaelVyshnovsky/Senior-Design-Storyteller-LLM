The barrier had a thickness of  and the area was determined by the casters skill level. The inside of the barrier appeared as a wall cast in shadow, while the exterior appeared as a wall of purple-brown stone with a rough texture.\nThe caster and any priest of Ghaunadaur were able to freely cross this barrier. Any other creature who touched the the wall was attacked by up to four large tentacles. The wall was able to manifest up to twenty tentacles at a time, each with a maximum length of . The tentacles appeared anywhere along the wall but only four could attack a single target at a time. Usually, a creature is restrained by a single tentacle and attacked by the other three, inflicting physical damage. The tentacles could be severed.\nThe wall also extruded up to two large bird-like beaks. The beaks delivered a potent poison. The beaks also hissed and clacked loudly when a creature came in contact with the wall, to alert the priests of an interloper.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, a snake and the beak from an octopus or any avian creature. The snake did not have to be alive, a dead snake was suffice."
