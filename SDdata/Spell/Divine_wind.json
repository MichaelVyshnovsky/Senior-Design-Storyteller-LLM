        "mainbody": "'''''Divine wind''''' was a powerful [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed a shugenja to summon extremely powerful winds. The force of the wind was similar to that of a hurricane. It had the power to capsize ships, collapse wooden structures and topple trees. The winds had an effect on the terrain. If cast over a large body of water, large waves formed; if cast in a dry area or desert, a sandstorm formed; and if cast during winter or in an area with snow, a blizzard formed. If cast near a large fire, a firestorm formed. Creatures caught in the wind suffered damage, and risked drowning or being buried in blowing [[sand]] or snow.  The powerful winds greatly reduced movement and communication between creatures became difficult. Missiles and projectiles became impossible to use.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s. The shugenja required a holy symbol of their [[deity]], a portable [[drum]], and a flag or banner inscribed with the calligraphic character for wind."
