'''''Flock of birds''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Thoth]] called [[Scrivener]]s.

==Effects==
This spell would summon a large flock of birds to a {{SI|30|ft}} sphere where they would normally be found. The birds were so densely packed that vision was limited to {{SI|20|ft}} and spellcasting within the sphere was impossible.

The scrivener could direct the birds to fanatically attack a single target within the sphere. The birds were not able to harm creatures immune to normal weapons. Nothing would drive the birds away before the spell ended, but they could be killed by normal methods.

[[Druid]]s and nature priests viewed this spell as an affront to nature and would make the caster atone for its use if witnessed by the druid.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a handful of feathers and the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast.
