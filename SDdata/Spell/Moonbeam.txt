'''Moonbeam''' was an [[evocation]] spell that created a movable beam of light that penetrated darkness and forced [[lycanthropy|lycanthropes]] to change shape.

==Effects==
The ''moonbeam'' was cone-shaped and originated from the caster's hand. Once each minute of the spell's duration, the caster could choose a different direction in which to point the beam. It was the intensity of the [[Sel√ªne (moon)|full moon]] and any lycanthropes caught in the cone of moonlight would involuntarily change into their animal form unless they could muster the will to prevent it. Likewise, were-creatures in the moonlit area already in animal form had to exert willpower to change back.

''[[Darkness]]'' spells of higher level blocked ''moonbeam'' but those of equal or lower level did not. Unlike ''[[light]]'' spells, ''moonbeam'' did not dispel or counter magical darkness of equal or lower level.

==Components==
[[Verbal component|Verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components were required. The [[divine magic|divine]] version worked off the caster's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]], while the [[arcane]] version required a pinch of white powder. After the [[Second Sundering]], the spell required as materials a piece of opalescent [[feldspar]] and seeds of any moonseed plant.

==Notable Users==
* [[Cegilune]]'s [[avatar]] was capable of casting ''moonbeam'' during a fullmoon, though her variant of the spell affected creatures like a ''[[symbol of insanity]]''.<ref>
