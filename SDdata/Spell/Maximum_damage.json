        "mainbody": "Maximum damage was an alteration spell that increased the lethality of non-magical weapons.\nUpon casting this spell, the caster enhanced a number of mundane, non-enchanted weapons, causing them to be particularly harmful and inflict the maximum amount of damage of which they were capable. At least nine weapons could be affected by a single casting of maximum damage but this number increased with the skill and power of the caster. The duration of this spell lasted only a matter of seconds.\nThis spell had no effects on previously enchanted, or otherwise magical weapons.\nThis spell was unique to the elves of Evermeet. The specifications of its casting were a well-kept secret of the island realm.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a rod of silver, worth at least 100 gp. Any weapons affected by this spell had to be in contact with the rod at the time of its casting."
