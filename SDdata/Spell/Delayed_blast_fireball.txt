Delayed blast fireball, or delayed blast fire ball was an evocation spell that was like fireball but could be given a timed detonation.
Other than being similar to fireball, the damage of the spell was increased and the spell would detonate with a timed trigger. Later versions of the spell created a fiery "bead" that could be thrown and explode, sometimes in the throwers hand.
The post-Second Sundering version of the spell could be made even more powerful if cast by a user with more skill.
Only verbal and somatic components were needed for the casting of the pre-Second Sundering version of this spell. Following the Second Sundering, casting this spell required material components in the form of sulfur and a small ball of bat guano.
This spell was invented by the arcanist and Fire Warden of Netheril Noanar and called Noanars delayed fireball in  (two years earlier than the simpler fireball).
