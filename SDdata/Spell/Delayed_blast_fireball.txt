'''''Delayed blast fireball''''', or '''''delayed blast fire ball''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that was like ''[[fireball]]'' but could be given a timed detonation.

==Effect==
Other than being similar to ''fireball'', the damage of the spell was increased and the spell would detonate with a timed trigger. Later versions of the spell created a fiery "bead" that could be thrown and explode, sometimes in the thrower's hand.

The post-[[Second Sundering]] version of the spell could be made even more powerful if cast by a user with more skill.

==Components==
Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were needed for the casting of the pre-Second Sundering version of this spell. Following the Second Sundering, casting this spell required [[material component]]s in the form of [[sulfur]] and a small ball of [[bat]] [[guano]].<ref>

==History==
This spell was invented by the [[arcanist]] and Fire Warden of [[Netheril]] [[Noanar]] and called '''''Noanar's delayed fireball''''' in {{Yearlink|-2305}} (two years earlier than the simpler ''fireball'').
