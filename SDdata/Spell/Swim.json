        "mainbody": "Swim was a spell used by druids, sorcerers, wizards, and wu jen, that allowed the caster to bestow on a creature the ability to swim like a fish.\nWhen cast, the spell allowed a creatures equipment to be carried with the same ease as if walking on land. A creature overloaded with equipment would still sink and drown. Although the spell gave the subject an incredible advantage in water, it did not give the ability to breathe underwater.\nThe reverse of this spell was sink.Not to be confused with the Faer√ªnian spell sink. It removed the ability to swim from aquatic creatures, making them only able to swim as if they were a terrestrial creature. A creature who could not swim sunk rapidly and drowned.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, the scale of a goldfish."
