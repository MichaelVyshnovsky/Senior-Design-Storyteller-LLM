Permanent lure was a divine necromancy spell from the charm and necromantic spheres that changed a single feature on the casters body to match that of a creature they had seen.
The casting priest could only have one permanent lure active at any given time. The desired change needed to be something natural to the casters race and gender. A permanent lure lasted for several years depending on the skill of the caster, but could be removed early with the successful casting of three dispel magic spells or by a wish or limited wish. Attempting to place a second permanent lure when one was already active resulted in both changed features melting away, leaving those areas of the body terribly disfigured.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a gemstone worth at least 500 gp, a vial of holy water, and a piece of the casters skin to cast.
This rare spell was granted by Sune, the goddess of beauty.
