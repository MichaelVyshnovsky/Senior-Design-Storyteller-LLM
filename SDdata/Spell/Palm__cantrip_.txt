Palm was a legerdemain cantrip that beginning wizards could learn. It simultaneously created an illusion of a small object and made the actual object invisible for a few seconds.
This cantrip only worked on small objects that could fit in the casters hand. It screened one object from view, similar to the hide cantrip (but effective from any viewing angle), and created an exact illusion of the same object in the same spot. This allowed the caster to pick up or manipulate the object while it appeared to remain in its original place. The spell lasted only six seconds, so the caster typically covered the illusory object in some way before it blinked out of existence.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster spoke a magic word while pointing at the target object.
