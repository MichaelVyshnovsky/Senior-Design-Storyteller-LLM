Create talisman was a spell unique to Maztica, the pinnacle of the art of the magic-users called hishnashapers and plumaweavers.
This spell allowed such an artisan to create a talisman of hishna or pluma, respectively, which were both a work of art and a magic item. It was exceptional also in the long time it required from a quarter of a year to one and a half years to create a talisman of hishna and even one year longer to create a talisman of pluma.
Aside from verbal and somatic components, the artisan required the materials necessary to construct the talisman.
