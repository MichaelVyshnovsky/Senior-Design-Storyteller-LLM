Knowledge of the ages was a channel divinity power granted to clerics of the Knowledge domain.
Knowledge of the ages gave the cleric knowledge about doing or using something for ten minutes. During this time, the caster was effectively trained in the use of the tool or in conducting the action they were to do.
Only the clerics skill was needed to evoke this power.
