'''''Dragonbane''''' was an [[abjuration]] spell that warded an area against intrusion by [[dragon]]s, both living and [[undead]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/234/The Draconomicon|16}}

==Effects==
Any dragon that failed to resist ''dragonbane'' was physically unable to enter the protected area for the duration of the spell. Spellcasting, breath weapons, or hurled objects were not prevented from crossing the barrier. The area of effect was a cube whose sides were the caster's level times {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}}. Any dragons already within the area when the spell was cast were not affected by this spell unless they left the area and attempted to reenter. The duration of ''dragonbane'' was only a few minutes but could be extended greatly by use of a ''[[focus]]'' spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a scale from a dragon.
