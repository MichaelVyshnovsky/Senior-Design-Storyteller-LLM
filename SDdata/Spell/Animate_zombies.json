        "mainbody": "Animate zombies was a common spell.\nThis spell was similar to animate dead. When cast, the caster was able to create a fully prepared zombie. The amount of zombies the caster could produce was dependant on their skill level. The spell only functioned on the corpses of humanoids. The zombie obeyed the casters verbal commands and was animated until either destroyed or turned. The spell was not vulnerable to dispel magic.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a drop of blood and a small amount of bone powder, although a shard from a bone was acceptable. In addition, the spell required the caster to soak the corpse in a mineral bath for a day before casting. This mineral bath required special salts which cost 200 gp or more. The caster had to cast the spell within 24 hours.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
