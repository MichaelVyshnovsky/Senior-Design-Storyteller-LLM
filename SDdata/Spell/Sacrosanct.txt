'''''Sacrosanct''''' was a powerful [[divine magic|divine]] [[abjuration]] and [[alteration]] [[spell]] from the [[wards sphere]] that kept intruders from entering temples.

==Effects==
The area to be protected was outlined with a radiant glow during the spell's casting. This area was spherical and centered on the caster. Its size depended on the skill of the caster. Once activated, the barrier intercepted intruders using [[magic]] or [[psionics]] to travel into the temple via the [[Astral Plane]], ethereally, by ''[[teleport]]ation'', and so on. Once intercepted, intruders were transported to a random location in [[Faer√ªn]].

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a piece of [[rubber]], a small mirror or other reflective surface, and the eye of an [[owl]] or other creature that could see well in the dark.

==History==
This was an incredibly rare spell according to [[Volothamp Geddarm]].
