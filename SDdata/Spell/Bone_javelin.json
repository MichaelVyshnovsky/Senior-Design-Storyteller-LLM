        "mainbody": "Bone javelin was a spell that conjured a floating javelin made of bone that could be commanded by the caster.\nThe bone javelin could be willed to fly at an extremely fast rate and twist and turn as needed to navigate around obstacles. It could damage normal creatures, undead, and those from other planes.\nThis spell was crafted by the lich Shangalar, when he was still a mortal tiefling wizard in Calimshan.\nAlong with a verbal and somatic component this spell required a tiny replica javelin made of any organic material, a fragment of bone and a drop of blood from the caster."
