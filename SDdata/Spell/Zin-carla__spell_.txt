'''''Zin-carla''''' was a [[spell]] practiced by the [[drow]], given only to those who had most pleased [[Lolth]] the Spider Queen.

==Effects==
''Zin-carla'' was a spell that could give a corpse a semblance of life. It was a more advanced form of reanimation, where the reanimated corpse was not simply a mindless [[zombie]], but retained all the capabilities it had while it was alive. The corpse was also bound to do a single task, chosen by the person that reanimated it and approved by Lolth. To give the corpse the abilities it had while it was alive, the spirit of the person who the corpse belonged to in life was called to inhabit the body, but was given very little control over the corpse's actions beyond the use of its abilities.

==Notable Uses==
In [[1338 DR]], [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]], weapons master of [[House Do'Urden]], was reanimated in this grisly way ten years after being killed in sacrifice to Lolth. [[Matron Mother]] [[Malice Do'Urden]] ordered ''zin-carla'' so she could send Zaknafein out to destroy [[Drizzt Do'Urden]], who had betrayed the family ten years before. The [[yochlol]] present gasped and told her she'd gone too far, but eventually agreed. The priestesses of House Do'Urden had to work for weeks before they could send Zak out hunting. ''Zin-carla'' made Zak do things he wouldn't have done normally, and he killed many of the inhabitants of the [[Underdark]] before he reached Drizzt in [[Blingdenstone]]. However, he ultimately hurled himself into a chasm in the [[Acid Aerie]] to prevent himself from killing his son.<ref>
