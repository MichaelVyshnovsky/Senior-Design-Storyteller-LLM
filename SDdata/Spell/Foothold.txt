Foothold was a rare alteration spell of the southern magic tradition. 
The spell caused hands made of stone to rise from the ground, grabbing onto creatures in the target area. Any creature in a 30 ft by 30 ft (9x9 m) area would be affected. Creatures ensnared by the spell could not move, but could attack normally or cast spells, until the spell expired. 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, vultures claw.
