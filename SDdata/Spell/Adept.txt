An '''adept''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] spellcaster found in uncivilized or less sophisticated regions of [[Toril]], where resources were not present to train either [[wizard]]s or [[cleric]]s.

==Notable Adepts==
Adepts from the [[Thousand Fists]] [[orc]] tribe were known to have created [[Talisman of spell turning|''talismans of spell turning'']].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 10}}
