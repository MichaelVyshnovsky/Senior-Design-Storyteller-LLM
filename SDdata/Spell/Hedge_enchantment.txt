'''''Hedge enchantment''''' was a lesser [[spell]] akin to ''[[enchant an item]]'', which [[hedge wizard]]s employed to make baubles.

==Effects==
The spell allowed the caster to labor for up to a week, weaving [[magic]] into the item. Only objects of little combat use could be created; the typical example involved embedding a minimal cantrip into the object, something that could be accomplished with a ''[[prestidigitation|cantrip]]'' spell.

==Components==
Besides [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, the item to be enchanted was considered a [[material component]].This is never explicitly stated in the text; however, as the spell is explained as akin to ''enchant an item'', which counts the object to be enchanted as a component, this article is written under the assumption that the item is what is meant as the material component.

==History==
The spell was only known by hedge wizards; it was common amongst their profession.
