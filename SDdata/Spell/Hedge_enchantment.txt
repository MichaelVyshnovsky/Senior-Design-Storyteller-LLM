Hedge enchantment was a lesser spell akin to enchant an item, which hedge wizards employed to make baubles.
The spell allowed the caster to labor for up to a week, weaving magic into the item. Only objects of little combat use could be created the typical example involved embedding a minimal cantrip into the object, something that could be accomplished with a cantrip spell.
Besides verbal and somatic components, the item to be enchanted was considered a material component.This is never explicitly stated in the text however, as the spell is explained as akin to enchant an item, which counts the object to be enchanted as a component, this article is written under the assumption that the item is what is meant as the material component.
The spell was only known by hedge wizards it was common amongst their profession.
