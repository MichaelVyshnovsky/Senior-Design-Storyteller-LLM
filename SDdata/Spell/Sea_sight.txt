Sea sight was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by wizards.
With this spell the target could see through water twice as well as they could on land. Water clarity still affected the distance the target could view. Targets could even stare down into water from a boat without having their vision disturbed by reflections.
This spell required the eye of an octopus or squid to cast.
