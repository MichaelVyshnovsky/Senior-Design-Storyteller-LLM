        "mainbody": "Hold portal was a low-level arcane spell that magically locked a door. It was formerly known as Undines hold portal.\nAs the name said, hold portal magical held closed any door, gate, shutter, or window, whether it was fashioned of metal, stone, or wood. It could target only one such opening, but it could be up to 20 square feet (1.85 square meters) in area and up to 100 feet (30 meters) away at minimum casting, while more experienced casters could extend this. For all intents and purposes, the door was securely closed and locked as it would be under normal circumstances. It could still be forced open, but was rather harder to do so.\nThe spell could also be used on existing portals that went through crystal spheres, as long as they were sufficiently small to fit within its area of effect.\nThe effect lasted for a number of minutes, or until the caster wished to dismiss it. However, a knock spell or dispel magic would end it.\nThe required only a verbal component.\nThe spell was attributed to the Netherese arcanist Undine in 2938 NY (âˆ’921 DR).\nCategoryAbjuration spells\nCategoryAlteration spells\nCategoryUniversal spells\nCategoryUniversal (province)\nCategoryVariations\nCategoryUndines spells\nCategoryKara-Turan spells\nCategorySorcerer spells\nCategoryWizard spells\nCategoryWu jen spells\n1i4g6qdodbwhnbszmwvf8e6dthb506f"
