Curse of the everbleeding wounds was a spell used by clerics of Urdlen.
When cast, this vicious spell prevented any wounds inflicted on a touched targeted creature in the near future from healing magically. This effect was similar to that of a sword of wounding. The only way to reverse this spell and allow the wounds to heal magically was with limited wish, remove curse, or wish spells. A periapt of wound closure could provide an individual with immunity from the effects of this spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the holy symbol of Urdlen and a small knife.
