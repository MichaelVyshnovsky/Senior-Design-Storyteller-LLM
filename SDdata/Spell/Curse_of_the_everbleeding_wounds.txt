'''''Curse of the everbleeding wounds''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Urdlen]].
 
==Effects==
When cast, this vicious spell prevented any wounds inflicted on a touched targeted creature in the near future from healing magically. This effect was similar to that of a ''[[sword of wounding]]''. The only way to reverse this spell and allow the wounds to heal magically was with ''[[limited wish]]'', ''[[remove curse]]'', or ''[[wish]]'' spells. A ''[[periapt of wound closure]]'' could provide an individual with immunity from the effects of this spell.
 
==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s the [[holy symbol]] of Urdlen and a small [[knife]].
