Alter normal winds was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by wizards.
With this spell the caster could harness normal wind and increase its power to the next state. Becalmed wind could be changed into a breeze, a storm could be changed into a gale, etc.

A small silver tube was needed to cast this spell. The caster would blow into the tube to attract the winds attention.
