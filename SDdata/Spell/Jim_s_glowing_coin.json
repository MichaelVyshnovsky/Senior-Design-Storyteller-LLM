        "mainbody": "'''''Jim's glowing coin''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that distracted a number of creatures within range, making them slow to react and worse at perceiving their surroundings.",
        "Effects": "The caster tossed a coin to a point within a range of 60 feet (18 meters). The coin then started to glow in a way similar to the ''[[light]]'' spell, distracting creatures of the caster's choice within 30 feet (9.1 meters) of the coin for 1 minute, without requiring the caster to keep concentrating on the spell. Creatures distracted this way had difficulty spotting hidden opponents and were slow to react at the start of a combat.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Somatic component|somatic]], [[Material component|material]], and [[royalty component]]s of 2 [[gp]]. The material required was the coin used as the focus of the distraction.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to the [[wizard]] [[Jim Darkmagic]]."
