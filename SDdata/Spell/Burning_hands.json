            "Inscription": "According to the [[Book of the Silver Talon]], the ingredients for the [[ink]] used to inscribe ''burning hands'' into [[spellbook]]s was: one ounce of [[giant octopus]] ink, two ounces of green plant matter, four ounces of animal flesh, a piece of wood (such as a log or plank), a scrap of cloth, a sheet of parchment and either 3 drops of [[red dragon|red]]/[[gold dragon]] blood, two ounces of [[fire elemental]] phlogiston, six [[salamander]] scales, or the horn of an [[efreeti]]. The last component of the ink could be replaced with the ichor of a [[hellhound]], blood of a [[fire drake]] or ash of a [[tome guardian]].\n\nAll the components, save for the ink, would be added to a burning brazier and burnt down. The coals that fed the fire would be added to the mixture and lastly combined with the octopus ink. The sediment would not be emptied and the concoction was to remain covered until cool."
        },
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Primidon]] in {{Yearlink|-1909}} and was originally called ''Primidon's burners''.\n\nBefore the [[Spellplague]], ''burning hands'' was also used by [[sorcerer]]s and could only be cast a number of times equal to how many times the wizard had prepared the spell or the sorcerer had energy for. After the Spellplague ''burning hands'' became easier to access, though as a consequence it no longer grew in power with its caster."
