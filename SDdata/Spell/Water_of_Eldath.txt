Water of Eldath was a divine magic spell available to priests of Eldath, the Goddess of Singing Waters. It created three flasks of a potion that had many curative and purification abilities.
When cast, this spell filled three potion bottles with water of Eldath that could be used topically or taken internally. The potion had the following properties
When a flask was poured over a subject, it
* Killed mold and musk creeper spores, even monstrous kinds
* Killed rot grubs
* Purified water of all pollutants, oils, diseases, parasites, and anything that caused an unpleasant taste or odor and/or
* Acted as neutralize poison on an object, creature, or victim.
If a flask was drunk by a creature, it
* Closed all wounds to prevent blood loss, including those made by weapons enchanted to prevent healing
* Acted as cure disease
* Acted as remove curse
* Cured mummy rot and/or
* Cured lycanthropy.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components three drops of water blessed by Eldath herself, one of her servitors, or one of her high-ranking priests (known as an Exalted of Eldath). One drop was placed in each of the three flasks to be filled by the resulting potion.
Water of Eldath was included in the Crystrum of Tranquility, a holy "book" of the church of Eldath.
