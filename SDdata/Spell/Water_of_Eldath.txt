'''''Water of Eldath''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to priests of [[Eldath]], the Goddess of Singing Waters. It created three flasks of a [[potion]] that had many curative and purification abilities.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell filled three potion bottles with ''water of Eldath'' that could be used topically or taken internally. The potion had the following properties:

===Used Externally===
When a flask was poured over a subject, it:
* Killed mold and [[musk creeper]] spores, even monstrous kinds;
* Killed [[rot grub]]s;
* Purified water of all pollutants, [[oil]]s, [[disease]]s, parasites, and anything that caused an unpleasant taste or odor; and/or
* Acted as ''[[neutralize poison]]'' on an object, creature, or victim.

===Used internally===
If a flask was drunk by a creature, it:
* Closed all wounds to prevent blood loss, including those made by weapons enchanted to prevent healing;
* Acted as ''[[cure disease]]'';
* Acted as ''[[remove curse]]'';
* Cured [[mummy rot]]; and/or
* Cured [[lycanthropy]].

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s three drops of water blessed by Eldath herself, one of her servitors, or one of her high-ranking priests (known as an Exalted of Eldath). One drop was placed in each of the three flasks to be filled by the resulting potion.

==History==
''Water of Eldath'' was included in the ''[[Crystrum of Tranquility]]'', a holy "book" of the [[church of Eldath]].<ref>
