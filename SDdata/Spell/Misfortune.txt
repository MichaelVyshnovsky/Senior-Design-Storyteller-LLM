Misfortune was a divine spell used by priests devoted to Beshaba.
This spell caused the recipient to experience moderate bad luck with practically any act they performed.
The caster needed to touch the target with a bare hand for the spell to function. The caster could end the spell at will, otherwise only a dispel magic or remove curse spell would end it permaturely.
This spell required only somatic components to cast.
