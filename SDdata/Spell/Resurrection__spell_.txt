'''''Resurrection''''' was a [[conjuration]] or [[necromancy]] spell that could restore life and full vigorous health to one dead creature. Earlier versions of this spell were reversible, called '''''[[destruction]]''''', and could turn a victim to dust.

{{Quote|Clerics across the Realms wield the power to return life to any soul deemed worthy or willing enough. It is strange, then, that these so frequently intersect with those deemed wealthy enough, for the components for such a spell are beyond the means of most mortals.<p/>

I have interviewed those who have made such a return, and in truth have found them to be of the most dull and unimaginative sort that I cannot possibly imagine what it is they were so eager to return to.|''[[Iosefa Elgin]], as excerpted from [[Metatext: Rebound]]''.<ref name="BGIII" >}}

==Effects==
The application of this spell was limited to creatures that had been dead for no longer than ten years per level of the caster. This spell did not work on creatures that died of old age but ''did'' work on creatures killed by a death effect.

''Resurrection'' required at least a piece of the deceased that was part of the body at the time of death; even the remains of a ''[[disintegrate]]d'' victim were sufficient. The deceased had to have enough constitution (at the time of death) to survive the process, but the body was fully restored, poisons removed, and diseases cured by this spell. Even memorized spells were restored. All versions of ''resurrection'' required the priest to touch the remains in order to cast the spell.

Upon completion of this spell, there was a price to be paid. For the necromantic versions, the caster aged three years and was mentally and physically exhausted, requiring one or more days of bedrest before being able to cast spells or engage in combat again, but the recipient was made whole. For the conjuration version, the newly raised creature lost a level of experience, or their constitution was significantly weakened if they had no more experience to lose. 

[[Undead]] creatures that had been destroyed and had some remains left could be ''resurrected'' back to life.

When cast in reverse, ''destruction'' instantly killed the victim and turned them to dust such that only a ''[[wish]]'' or equally powerful magics could bring them back. If the target managed to overcome this [[death magic]], they were instead subjected to a large amount of damage (which could also have been fatal). The priest had to successfully touch the target in order to cast the spell but did not age three years.

==History==
For at least 20 days in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], resurrection magic failed to work entirely, due to the effects of the [[death curse]].

==Components==
In addition to a verbal component, the conjuration spell required the caster to touch the remains, sprinkle them with [[holy water]], and provide at least 10,000 gp worth of [[diamond]]s. The necromancy version only required holy water for ''resurrection'' and unholy water for ''destruction'' in addition to the verbal and somatic components, including touching the remains.
