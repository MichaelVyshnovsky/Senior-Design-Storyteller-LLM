        "mainbody": "The '''Symphony of Madness''' was a song [[ritual]] created by the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] to control the [[primordial]] [[Maegera|Maegera the Inferno]] and harness its powers.",
        "Background": "The Symphony was created by the ''Choir'', a group of [[plaguechanged]] creatures that sang a telepathic tune that could be heard at any point between [[Neverwinter]], [[Helm's Hold]], and [[Gauntlgrym]]. The song was powered by the [[Spellplague]] energies the [[aboleth]]s harnessed from the [[Cauldron of Blue Fire]]. Therefore, those creatures chosen to be part of the ''Choir'' were subjected to a series of increasingly traumatic tests to determine their aptitude to \"sing\" in the ''Choir'', and eventually were warped by the Spellplague energies into something unrecognizable.\n\nThe song of the ''Choir'' was, in essence, a beam of focused Spellplague energy that could twist stone or flesh depending on subtle variations in the ''Choir's'' harmony, warping reality in ways that made sense only to an aberrant mind. By using the [[Hex Locus]], the Sovereignty could enhance the Symphony's range, to reach places far away from the normal range of the Symphony.\n\nThose who \"heard\" the Symphony would suffer horrible nightmares. The only way to avoid having nightmares within the Symphony's range was to sleep near a [[dreamthief doll]]. Excessive exposure to the Symphony could turn creatures into [[spellscar]]red or even into [[plaguechanged]] beings. If focused against a creature or group of creatures, the Symphony could corrupt and twist the mind of the targets, turning them into thralls of the Sovereignty, puppets whose only purpose was to serve their masters to the best of their abilities, or even turn the most unfortunate targets into [[foulspawn]] if the corruption went too far.",
        "History": "The Symphony of Madness began to be sung some time after the Spellplague of [[1385 DR]] had transported the Abolethic Sovereignty to [[Faer√ªn]]. Sensing the presence of Maegera, the aboleths wanted to use its power for their own ends.\n\nThe first tests of the Symphony occurred a few years later, when the Sovereignty used the Symphony to corrupt the [[elder brain]] of a colony of [[mind flayer]]s living in Gauntlgrym, something that in turn corrupted the mind flayers, turning them into plaguechanged puppets of the Sovereignty."
