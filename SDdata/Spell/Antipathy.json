        "mainbody": "'''''Antipathy''''' was an [[enchantment]] spell repelled certain creatures from an object or location.",
        "Effect": "''Antipathy'' caused a chosen object or location (covered up to 17,000 cubic feet or 480 cubic meters, or more for more experienced casters) in close proximity to them at the time of casting to emanate magical vibrations. This lasted up to 34 hours or more, unless dismissed early.\n\nThese emanations repelled beings of a certain kind chosen by the caster, whether a specific race or monster (for example, [[red dragon]]s but not all [[dragon]]s) or an alignment (such as [[chaotic evil]]). Those lacking the will to resist felt an overwhelming urge to avoid the object or leave the affected area, to abandon it, shun it, and never return of their own free will, at least while the spell was active. Even those who resisted were deeply discomforted and distracted if they stayed or touched the object.\n\n''Antipathy'' countered and dispelled ''[[sympathy]]''.",
        "Components": "It required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s. [[Arcane]] spellcasters required a lump of [[alum]] soaked in vinegar, while [[divine]] spellcasters needed only a [[divine focus]]."
