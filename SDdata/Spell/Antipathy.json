        "mainbody": "Antipathy was an enchantment spell repelled certain creatures from an object or location.\nAntipathy caused a chosen object or location (covered up to 17,000 cubic feet or 480 cubic meters, or more for more experienced casters) in close proximity to them at the time of casting to emanate magical vibrations. This lasted up to 34 hours or more, unless dismissed early.\nThese emanations repelled beings of a certain kind chosen by the caster, whether a specific race or monster (for example, red dragons but not all dragons) or an alignment (such as chaotic evil). Those lacking the will to resist felt an overwhelming urge to avoid the object or leave the affected area, to abandon it, shun it, and never return of their own free will, at least while the spell was active. Even those who resisted were deeply discomforted and distracted if they stayed or touched the object.\nAntipathy countered and dispelled sympathy.\nIt required verbal and somatic components. Arcane spellcasters required a lump of alum soaked in vinegar, while divine spellcasters needed only a divine focus."
