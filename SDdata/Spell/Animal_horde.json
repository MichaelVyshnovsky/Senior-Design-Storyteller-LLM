        "mainbody": "nimal horde was a special divine conjuration quest spell from the animal and summoning spheres that summoned a group of animals to the caster.\nThe number of animals summoned was determined by the skill of the caster, but could be upwards of a literal horde of creatures. The casting priest was aware of the type and quantity of animals within the spells area of effect. Furthermore, they could decide the type and quantity of animal that was summoned from those available. Summoned animals would not fight against each other even if they were natural enemies, focusing instead on providing aid to the caster. The animals would return to their lairs when the spell expired.\nThis spell did not require spell components of any kind.\nThis spell was used by druids who served Moander during the height of ancient Netherils power."
