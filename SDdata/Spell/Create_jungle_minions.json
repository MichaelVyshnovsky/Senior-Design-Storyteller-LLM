        "mainbody": "'''''Create jungle minions''''' was a [[divine magic]] spell available to [[priest]]s of the [[Zakhara]]n [[Zakharan pantheon|savage goddess]] [[Ragarra]], and some specialized [[kahin]]s. It transformed certain creatures into [[lesser segarran]]s.",
        "Effects": "Depending on the power of the priest, this spell created three or more of the humanoid, crocodile-headed [[divine minion]]s of the godess Ragarra called lesser segarrans either from [[crocodile]]s or [[alligator]]s, or from [[demihuman]]s, [[human]]s or [[humanoid]]s.<ref> Even unwilling targets ran the risk of being affected by this spell. Unlike with the related ''[[conjure jungle minions]]'', this transformation was permanent, but like with the less-powerful spell, the caster could direct the actions of newly made segarrans, usually to attack their enemies, until they made a kill. The segarrans then consumed any slain victims and only afterwards followed the commands of the priest again. If no opponent was overwhelmed and devoured, the caster often was afflicted with a ''[[Bestow curse|curse]]'', showing Ragarra's disfavor.",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the priest to throw the dust of powdered alligator or crocodile claws towards the creatures to be transformed."
