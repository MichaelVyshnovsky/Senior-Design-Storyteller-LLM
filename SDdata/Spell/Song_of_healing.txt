Song of healing was a divine necromancy spell that allowed clerics to heal others with their voice.
When the caster uttered the verbal component of song of healing, the spells magic was guided and chosen recipients within range had their wounds partially healed.
Magical silence bestowed upon the casting cleric, or deafness inflicted upon the recipient, had no effect on the spells curative properties.
The specifications of song of healing were inscribed within Wythyndles Round Book, a holy relic of the followers of Milil.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast.
