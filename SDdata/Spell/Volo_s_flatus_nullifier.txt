Volos flatus nullifier was a simple air-clearing arcane spell created by Volothamp Geddarm, Master Traveler of the Realms, sometime before the late 15 century DR.
When cast, the spell removed strong smells of any foul gas within  from the caster. After being cast, the spell continually cleared the air around the caster for one minute and moved with them. As the spellcaster grew in arcane power the Volos flatus nullifier extended its duration. The spell affected such stenches as strong perfumes, skunk sprays, flatuses, and other similar aromas.
Volos flatus nullifier required verbal, somatic, and material components to be cast.
