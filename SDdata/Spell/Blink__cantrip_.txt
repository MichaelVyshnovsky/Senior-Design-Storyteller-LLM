Blink was a person-affecting cantrip that beginning wizards could learn. It caused a target creature to momentarily close one or more eyes.
This cantrip had a range of  and could target a single person or creature. If the target did not resist the spell, then all of its eyes closed for about half a second. If the target succeeded in resisting the spell, then only one eye was affected (or none, if the target had only one eye).
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster performed a finger snap while softly speaking a magic word such as hat-cha-cha.This is an allusion to the signature catchphrase of 20-century American comedian Jimmy Durante.
