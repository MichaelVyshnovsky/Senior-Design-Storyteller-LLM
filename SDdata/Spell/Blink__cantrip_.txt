'''''Blink''''' was a person-affecting [[cantrip]] that beginning [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It caused a target creature to momentarily close one or more eyes.

==Effects==
This cantrip had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and could target a single person or creature. If the target did not resist the spell, then all of its eyes closed for about half a second. If the target succeeded in resisting the spell, then only one eye was affected (or none, if the target had only one eye).

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster performed a finger snap while softly speaking a magic word such as ''hat-cha-cha''.This is an allusion to the signature catchphrase of 20{{th}}-century American comedian [[wikipedia:Jimmy Durante|Jimmy Durante]].
