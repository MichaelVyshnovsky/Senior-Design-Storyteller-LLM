        "mainbody": "'''''Khazid's procurement''''' was a [[divination]] and [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s. This spell was developed by [[Khazid]].",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to access rare or dangerous spell components provided they were both on the same plane of existence. When used in conjunction with a special mirror, the caster could visualize the desired spell component, and if the spell was successful the mirror served as a gateway between the caster and the component. The size of the gateway created by the mirror was limited by the size of the mirror's glass, so wizards often used larger mirrors with this spell to a maximum size of {{SI|3|ft|long=yes}} by {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}}.\n\nThe gateway appeared right next to the target spell component, allowing the wizard to reach their arm through the mirror and collect the item. The gateway would only allow the caster's arm to pass through, so the use of grabbing tools was out of the question. Anything on the other side of the gate could likewise reach through to grab the caster. Additionally, missiles or spells could be fired through the gate at the caster. Elemental forces could not pass through the gate, so if a wizard opened the gate under water he would not be flooded. The gate would vanish either when the spell ended or the caster moved more than {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} from it.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a lavish [[silver]] mirror worth at least 10,000 [[gp]], and an [[opal]] worth at least 1,000 gp to cast. The opal was powdered and sprinkled on the mirror and consumed. The mirror could be used repeatedly.",
        "History": "In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Diviner's Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] actively sold [[scroll]]s containing ''Khazid's procurement'' for around 2,450 [[gp]].{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Living City: The Ravens Bluff Diviner's Guild|16}}",
