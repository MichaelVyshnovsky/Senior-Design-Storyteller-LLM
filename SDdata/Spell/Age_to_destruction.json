        "mainbody": "Age to destruction was a common spell used by ninjas to commit acts of sabotage. \nThe spell would rapidly age any material by one hundred years. The maximum volume of material was 3 cubic feet (84.9 liters). The materials appearance was largely unaffected by the spell the material would only appear more weathered than before the spell was cast. Certain materials were affected more than others. Metal and wood were particularly susceptible but the spell had little effect on minerals and stone. \nThe spell did not affect creatures but could alter the effects of certain potions. For example, the spell did not reverse the effects of a longevity potion but if cast on the potion itself, it would render the potion useless.\nThe spell required only somatic components."
