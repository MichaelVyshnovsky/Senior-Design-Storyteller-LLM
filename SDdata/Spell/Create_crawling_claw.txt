Create crawling claw was an arcane ritual used to animate crawling claws from severed humanoid hands.
The spell turned ordinary severed hands into crawling claws under the casters control. As long as the caster was within  of the hands, they could free issue simple commands to them.
Animating a creatures hand did not require that the creature be dead nor did it preclude a deceased creature from being resurrected.
The ritual of course required severed hands, specifically left hands, that the caster intended to turn into crawling claws, and powerful casters could conceivably animate dozens of hands at a time. Preparation for the spell first required the casting of magic circle against good around both the caster and the severed hands, although this circle merely needed to be in place for the beginning of the ritual. The ritual itself took an hour to complete, requiring verbal and somatic casting as well as the fingernail clippings of a ghoul and a lost or stolen ring as the material components.
