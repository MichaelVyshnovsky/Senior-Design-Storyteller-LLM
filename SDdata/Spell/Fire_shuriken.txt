'''''Fire shuriken''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] known to the [[wu jen]] of [[Kara-Tur]] in the 1350s [[DR]], though it was also available to [[assassin]]s in the 1370s DR. It let them create and hurl [[shuriken]] of fire.

==Effects==
The spell created spinning pinwheels of magical fire, shaped like shuriken and sharp as a razor. The caster also gained the skill to use these shuriken as well as a trained warrior of the same experience, and they would not burn their hands. With a flick of the caster's hand, they were thrown toward the target, sparks flying off them. On striking, the flames and sharp edges of the early ''fire shuriken'' both caused injury or damage, before they dissipated in a puff of multi-colored smoke, which briefly obscured a victim's sight. The later ''fire shuriken'' only burned, not cut, and would not set fire to anything flammable. Initially, the caster could create one, two, or three ''fire shuriken'' as they gained power, but this later increased to nine or to six.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal]], [[somatic]] and [[material component]]s. The material component was a tiny shuriken coated in [[sulfur]] and pine sap. The somatic component involved quick hand motions.
