'''''Mask of Gargauth''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[enchantment]] [[spell]] used only by [[specialty priest]]s devoted to [[Gargauth]] called [[Malefactor]]s.

==Effects==
This spell allowed the malefactor to alter the appearance of themselves and their equipment to resembled any man-sized [[human]], [[humanoid]], or similar creature. The sizes could be changed larger or smaller by 50%. This spell even allowed flight if wings were added, but at one third of the normal rate. Any special abilities or weaknesses from the new form were not passed on to the caster. Changing back to the original form would end the spell early.

This spell lasted for many days, but the caster's appearance became more diabolical with each day that passed without the spell being recast, resulting in a permanent scar on the caster's charisma.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s an unblessed broken horn manifested by Gargauth and the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast.
