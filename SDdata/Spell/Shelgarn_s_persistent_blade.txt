Shelgarns persistent blade was an evocation spell used by wizards and sorcerers. This spell was created by Shelgarn.
This spell created a small blade of force capable of flitting around quickly and attacking targets. The blade was capable of striking ethereal and incorporeal creatures. The blade would continue to attack the same target unless otherwise directed by the caster.
