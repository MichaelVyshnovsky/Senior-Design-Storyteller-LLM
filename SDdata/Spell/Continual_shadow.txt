'''''Continual shadow''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Eshowdow]].

==Effects==
This spell created a permanent perpetual shadow within a {{SI|60|ft}} globe. The spell would last forever unless negated by ''[[dispel magic]]'' or a source of magic light. The spell could be centered anywhere the caster desired. If cast upon a moving target, such as a living creature, ''continual shadow'' would either follow right behind the creature or be centered directly on them. ''Continual shadow'' would cancel the light or darkness of areas affected by magical light or darkness, replacing them with gloomy shadows.

''Continual shadow'' eventually consumed the surface upon which it was cast, but solid objects could take centuries or even millenia before withering away.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
