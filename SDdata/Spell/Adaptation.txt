'''''Adaptation''''' was an extremely rare [[divine]] healing [[spell]] granted to [[cleric]]s by their deities.

==Effects==
The spell was cast upon a creature with a touch. It allowed the target to become unaffected by effects and gases that affected breathing. ''Adaptation'' rendered the target unaffected by poisonous or harmful gases, such as the effects of the ''[[stinking cloud]]'' spell, the recipient could not drown, and could exist in vacuum. The spell lasted for twenty four hours and the caster could divide the total time between multiple targets, with half an hour being the shortest. Effects of the spell were similar to wearing a ''[[necklace of adaptation]]''.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, as well as ''[[holy water]]'' as the [[material component]].

==Notable Users==
*General [[Clas Denwith]], the head of the [[Church of Tempus]] in [[Ormpetarr]], [[Sespech]], ''circa'' [[1370 DR]].
*General [[Vandemar Cordwin]], the leader of the Church of Tempus in the [[Vilhon Reach]] ''circa'' 1370 DR.
