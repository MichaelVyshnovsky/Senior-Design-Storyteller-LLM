Brand was a sadistic wizard spell created by a shigharak of the Brotherhood of the True Flame in Zakhara.
Brand was similar to the wizard mark spell save that it could be placed on any surface, including flesh. When cast, this spell burned between 1-6 figures into the subject matter. Living tissue suffered excruciating pain from the experience. Once placed upon an inanimate surface, only the caster of the spell could remove the brand. If placed on living tissue, the caster or a heal spell could remove a brand.
Persons with a brand on a visible part of their body were often shunned by others.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast.
