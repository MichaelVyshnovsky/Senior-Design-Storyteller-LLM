'''''Weapon shift''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Arvoreen]]. An [[arcane magic|arcane]] version of the spell existed.
 
==Effects==
When cast, this spell transformed a weapon into a completely different weapon. However, the spell had several conditions. The desired weapon had to be the same size and made from the same material as the original. It also had to be a weapon that the caster was capable of wielding. The spell had no effect whatsoever on magical weapons. The desired weapon was not magical but could be detected as a magical weapon. And finally, the caster had to grasp the weapon in their hand(s) for the duration of the spell, otherwise the spell expired. ''Weapon shift'' was vulnerable to spells such as ''[[dispel magic]]''.
 
==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], the [[holy symbol]] of Arvoreen. The arcane version of the spell required a piece of parchment that was folded in the shape of the desired weapon.
