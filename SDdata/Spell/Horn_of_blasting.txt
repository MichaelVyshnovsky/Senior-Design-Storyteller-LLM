The '''''horn of blasting''''' was a [[magic]]ally engineered [[horn]] that, when blown into following the utterance of its [[command word]],
{{Quote|A nether tide swept down the pass,<br>In search of silver plunder.<br>Two hundred strong the mists did cloak,<br>
Ready with waiting thunder.|The second stanza of [[Mintiper Moonsilver]]'s ballad ''[[Moonlight Paean]]'', with its veiled potential reference to ''horns of blasting''.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}}}}
==Description==
The ''horn'' appeared to be a mundane [[trumpet]]. They would sell in a magic shop in [[Faerûn]] for as much as 20,000 [[gold piece]]s To those able [[detect magic|to see such things]], the horns gave off a moderate [[evocation]] aura.

==Powers==
The horn harmed and potentially deafened creatures and caused structural damage to crystalline objects. Each time the horn was used in a given day, there was a chance it would explode and be utterly destroyed.

==Availability==
* Some ''horns of blasting'' were known to be found in the land of [[Zakhara]], as ancient tales spoke of great cities ruled by [[marid]]s that used ''[[wall against noise|walls against noise]]'' to protect against them and other auditory-based magical items.

==History==
''Horns of blasting'' were rumored to have been used by the [[Moonlight Men]] in their ambush of the [[orc]]s of the [[Nethertide Horde]] in the [[Battle of Turnstone Pass]]. One of the survivors of that battle was [[Mintiper Moonsilver]], who later wrote about the battle in his ''[[Moonlight Paean]]'', where some scholars believed the phrase "ready with waiting thunder" to be a reference to the ''horns''. At least two ''horns of blasting'' were indeed buried next to their former weilders in the [[Cairn of Moonlight]] in [[Turnstone Pass]].

===Julius Baggar's Horn===
One variety of horn was developed by a former military [[engineering|engineer]], [[Julius Baggar]]. Rather than work on perfecting [[siege engine]]s, or some other mechanical feat, Julius and his apprentices sought out magical [[book|tome]]s for insight and inspiration. Finding some ancient scripts that detailed, albeit theoretical, [[arcane]] lore that postulated on how to control, manipulate and even create sound waves. Julius applied that knowledge into a new piece of technology, his own version of the ''horn of blasting''.

After its completion, Julius demanded a practical experiment of its capabilities and had one of his apprentices blow into the horn while it was aimed in his direction. Unfortunately for the talented engineer, the horn worked perfectly well, and the horn's shockwaves tore him asunder.

By the year [[1369 DR]] the horn wound up in a subterranean dungeon beneath the [[Windspear Hills]].
