}}'''''Whispering sand''''' was a [[spell]] used by wizards in [[Anauroch]] and [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This spell imbued a handful of [[sand]] with a message from the caster. The caster determined the specific sand that was to hold a message. Examples of this were a cup of sand, a small patch of sand near a gate, etc. The caster would determine specific conditions that would trigger the sand message to whisper to the recipient. This condition needed to occur within {{SI|30|yd|long=yes}} of the sand. A wizard would then record a message into the sand; more powerful wizards could record longer messages. Anyone within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} could hear the message.

The sand could also be used to store any spell that only required a [[verbal]] component. The stored spell must be one known by the caster. The stored spell would trigger when the specific condition was met.

==Components==
This spell required sand to cast.
