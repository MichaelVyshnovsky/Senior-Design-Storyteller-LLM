        "mainbody": "Permanency prayer was a divine alteration spell from the creation sphere that rendered an enchantment upon an inanimate item permanent.\nThis spell had no effect upon living creatures. The casting priest touched the item and their holy symbol while praying to their god to make the enchantment permanent. The spell stood a better chance of succeeding if the casting priest was in favor of their god and the item was placed upon a sacred altar. The casting of permanency prayer was incredibly physically taxing for the caster, resulting in a permanent loss of vitality.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nPermanency prayer was an extremely rare spell according to Volothamp Geddarm."
