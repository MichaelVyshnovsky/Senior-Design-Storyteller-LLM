        "mainbody": "'''''Meld of Lolth''''' was a spell used by priestesses of [[Lolth]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell allowed the caster to meld with the mind of another being. This meld gave the caster the ability to not only see through the targeted creature's eyes but also read their thoughts and could even communicate telepathically. The spell was not affected by distance, however the connection was broken if the targeted creature was transported to another [[Cosmology|plane]]. \n\nThe spell also gave the caster the ability to ''[[Dominate person|dominate]]'' the targeted creature. The caster was also capable of casting a new spell through the enspelled individual. While the spell was in effect, the caster could move and talk normally and cast additional spells. If the targeted creature was killed, the caster risked suffering from system shock, which could kill them instantly. \n\nThe spell was often used by the priestesses of Lolth to control powerful and strong [[drow]] males before battle.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components."
