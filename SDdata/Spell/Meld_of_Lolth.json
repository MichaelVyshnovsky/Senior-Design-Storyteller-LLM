        "mainbody": "Meld of Lolth was a spell used by priestesses of Lolth. \nWhen cast, this spell allowed the caster to meld with the mind of another being. This meld gave the caster the ability to not only see through the targeted creatures eyes but also read their thoughts and could even communicate telepathically. The spell was not affected by distance, however the connection was broken if the targeted creature was transported to another plane. \nThe spell also gave the caster the ability to dominate the targeted creature. The caster was also capable of casting a new spell through the enspelled individual. While the spell was in effect, the caster could move and talk normally and cast additional spells. If the targeted creature was killed, the caster risked suffering from system shock, which could kill them instantly. \nThe spell was often used by the priestesses of Lolth to control powerful and strong drow males before battle. \nThis spell required verbal and somatic components."
