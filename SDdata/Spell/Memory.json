        "Effects": "The spell implanted a fabricated memory into a target. The spell was effective against any sentient creature that spoke the wu jen's language. During casting, the wu jen depicted the fictitious memory. The spell allowed for limited access to the existing memories of the target. An existing memory could be replaced with a fabricated one. \n\nThe reverse of the spell was ''[[erasement]]''. It allowed a wu jen to eliminate existing memories from a target. \n\nSpells such as ''[[dispel magic]]'' or ''[[remember]]'' reversed the effects of ''memory'' and ''erasement''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: the wu jen cast the spell using a brush, [[ink]] and a piece of [[paper]]."
