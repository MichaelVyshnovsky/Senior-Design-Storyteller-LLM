        "mainbody": "Memory was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur.\nThe spell implanted a fabricated memory into a target. The spell was effective against any sentient creature that spoke the wu jens language. During casting, the wu jen depicted the fictitious memory. The spell allowed for limited access to the existing memories of the target. An existing memory could be replaced with a fabricated one. \nThe reverse of the spell was erasement. It allowed a wu jen to eliminate existing memories from a target. \nSpells such as dispel magic or remember reversed the effects of memory and erasement.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components the wu jen cast the spell using a brush, ink and a piece of paper."
