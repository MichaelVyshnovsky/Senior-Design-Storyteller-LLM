        "Effects": "When cast, all low- to mid-level magical barriers within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the caster exploded. A violent blast of magical energy was released as a result. Any creature within {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} was at risk of suffering damage and becoming stunned from the burst.",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a [[material component]]: a slim spindle. It was created specifically for this spell and was made from blown glass. During casting, the caster broke it.",
        "History": "This spell was known to be used by wizards of the [[Cult of the Dragon]]."
