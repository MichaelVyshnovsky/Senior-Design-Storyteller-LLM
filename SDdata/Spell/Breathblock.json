        "mainbody": "Breathblock was a defensive spell that could only be cast by dragons.\nThe spell was similar to the shield spell used by humanoid wizards. When cast, an invisible barrier of force manifested around the dragon or an area. The barrier was  on each side. The barrier was mobile, so it could be used by a dragon as a shield. If used against the breath weapon of another dragon, the weapons effects are either deflected away or reflected back to the attacking dragon.\nThis spell required only a verbal component."
