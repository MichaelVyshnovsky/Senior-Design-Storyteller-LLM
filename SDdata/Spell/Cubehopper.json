        "mainbody": "'''''Cubehopper''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] uniquely designed to aid [[wizard]]s in traversing the [[plane]] of [[Acheron]].",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed the caster to create temporary [[portal]]s between any two of the gargantuan geometric blocks that floated all throughout Acheron. There was no distance limit, though the cubes had to exist within the same layer. The spell took one minute to cast and lasted until either a number of creatures equal to the caster's prowess had passed through them or until the duration had expired. The starting duration was a period of one hour, but was cumulatively longer depending upon the caster's prowess. Additionally, spellcasters could prematurely dispel their portals at will, or they could be dispelled by others with the spell ''[[gate seal]]''.<ref>",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, ''cubehopper'' required a [[material component]] in the form of a chip of [[iron]] from each of the cubes that were to be effected by the spell.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "There were numerous rumors in circulation that a variant of ''cubehopper'' existed that allowed for creating portals from one layer of Acheron to another. These rumors always mentioned that a special ''[[spell key]]'' was necessary, though those who peddled such rumors never seemed to have an answer as to what this ''spell key'' was.",
        "History": "This spell was notoriously utilized in the layer of [[Avalas]] by the leaders of the [[goblinoid]] and [[orc]] spirit legions that waged endless war against each other, either as escape routes or gateways to planned massacres.\n\nSometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[duergar]] sage living in Acheron by the name of [[Gheldoin]] gifted a [[spellbook]] containing ''cubehopper'' to a group of [[Ravenian]] adventurers after they impressed him by deciphering the script on an old [[scroll]] that detailed a story about [[Laduguer]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Stone and Steel|15,17}}"
