'''''Dire chant''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] from the [[necromantic sphere]] that created a sense of impending doom.

==Effects==
Any enemies of the caster within the area of effect felt the oppressive nature of the magic, hindering their combat abilities and their ability to resist the effects of other spells and [[magic]]. A ''dire chant'' lasted as long as the caster continued to chant. However, if used underground, the caster need only chant for one minute and the acoustics would carry the spell for ten minutes without the need for continued chanting.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal component]]s to cast.

==History==
This spell was only granted to [[dragon]]s by [[Null]], the Death Wyrm.
