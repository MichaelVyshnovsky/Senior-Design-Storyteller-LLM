'''''Call upon faith''''' was a simple but uncommon

==Effects==
The spell was cast before a priest was about to attempt a difficult act or task, asking for the aid of the god or goddess. If the priest had been true to the tenets of the faith, the caster would find him- or herself rewarded in the form of a greater likelihood of success.

==Components==
The spell required a [[holy symbol]], as well as [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, to cast.

==History==
In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, [[Chief Prelate]] [[Relarn Dayspring|Dayspring]] of the [[Clerical Circle]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] declared it illegal for priests to cast ''call upon faith'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]], threatening arrest for those that broke this decree.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}
