Call upon faith was a simple but uncommon
The spell was cast before a priest was about to attempt a difficult act or task, asking for the aid of the god or goddess. If the priest had been true to the tenets of the faith, the caster would find him- or herself rewarded in the form of a greater likelihood of success.
The spell required a holy symbol, as well as verbal and somatic components, to cast.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , Chief Prelate Dayspring of the Clerical Circle of Ravens Bluff declared it illegal for priests to cast call upon faith within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm, threatening arrest for those that broke this decree.
