        "mainbody": "Speak with dead, also seen as speak with the dead,\nThe corpse being subjected to this \"reading\" had to be intact enough to speak (such as having a mouth) and the questions asked had to be in a language that the deceased understood. The caster must have been within  of the corpse to cast the spell, and the spell would animate the body, not bring back the soul of the dead.\nThe knowledge stored in the corpse after death was only that which the deceased knew in life. Answers were usually short, truthful, and cryptic, like a riddle. More experienced priests could ask more questions for a longer period of time. For the older version of speak with dead, the longer the person had been dead, the higher the level of priest was needed to cast the spell. The animated corpses could not speculate on future events, and could not learn and process new information.\nIf the deceased was of a different alignment to the questioner (or did not wish to answer the question, as it saw the caster as an enemy), the imprint of the deceased on the corpse could resist speak with dead and negate the spell. In Kara-Tur, wu jen who cast this spell risked angering the dead, who would hold a grudge against the caster for disturbing them.\nThe post-1372 DR version of this spell required only verbal and somatic components plus the priests holy symbol or divine focus. After the Second Sundering, the spell required all three standard components, where the material component was lit incense, and lasted up to ten minutes.\nThe speak with dead that Tessaril Winter learned required a drop of the casters blood, a sprig of mint, a sprig of parsley, and red or black gem worth at least 100 gp that had been crushed to powder.\nUse of the spell was part of the protocol when the Municipal Guard of Arrabar faced with murder cases, including when individuals were slain by the members of the guard. Members of the Church of Waukeen were invited to perform the spell.\nTessaril Winter, Lord of Eveningstar, acquired an arcane version of speak with dead\nThe Red Wizards of Thay also created an arcane version of speak with dead, which allowed exactly three questions.\nThis spell was inscribed within the Kelemvorite relic the Testament of Vraer.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, the amulet of lost voices allowed its wearer to speak with the dead."
