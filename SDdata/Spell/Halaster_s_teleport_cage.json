        "mainbody": "'''''Halaster's teleport cage''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that modified the functioning of [[teleportation]] [[magic]], altering the effects they produced when cast. It was developed and used to great effect by the powerful [[archmage]] of [[the North]], [[Halaster Blackcloak]].",
        "Effects": "Upon casting, this spell created an area of effect that changed the destination of spells that re-located people or creatures. Whenever one of these spells were cast within the affected area, the target was transported to a completely random location also within the area.\n\nWhenever a ''teleportation'' spell was cast outside the cage, and attempted to transport a person or creature inside, the subject was relocated to a random location outside the area encompassed by the spell.\n\nIf multiple castings of ''teleport cage'' affected areas that overlapped one another, they merged to form a single area that operated as if it were affected by a single casting.\n\nSpells affected by ''teleport cage'' included ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[teleport]]'', ''[[greater teleport]]'', ''[[Refuge (spell)|refuge]]'', ''[[teleportation circle]]'' and ''[[word of recall]]'', among others.",
        "Usage": "The entire subterranean complex known as the [[Undermountain]] was enclosed within the largest ''teleport cage'' to ever exist on the face of [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Casting": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required a pile of ''[[diamond]] dust'' worth at least 1000 [[gp]]."
