Portal reformat was a transmutation spell that could permanently modify the key-property of a portal.
Quite often, portals were keyed. This meant that a portal was intentionally built with the necessity for some prerequisites to be fulfilled for it to be used by someone. For example, the Ched Nasad portal could only be used by male drow who were also divine casters, when it came to the surface side of it, it was keyed to work only at night. The portal reformat did one of three things. First, the caster could add an additional key to the portal. Second, the caster could take away the key and turn the portal completely non-functional. Third, the caster could remove a key and turn the portal into one that could be used by everyone. When the portal in question was one that used the key to determine its destination, using the third option allowed the caster to apply a sole destination, effectively cutting off the portals ability to connect to the other location.
Portal reformat required somatic and verbal components, a divine focus, and the casters essence to fuel the spell.
By 1372 DR, a magical staff called a staff of portals had been invented in the Underdark that could be used to cast the spell. It required the portal reformat spell to craft.
