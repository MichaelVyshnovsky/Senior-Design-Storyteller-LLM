False dawn was a spell that was commonly used by clerics of Lathander.
A caster used this spell to mimic a normal rising of the sun. The spell created a bright light that resembled the rising sun. The light was bright enough to dispel darkness-based spells. This spell not only harmed creatures sensitive to light, but also inflicted a state of confusion upon them. Undead creatures were particularly vulnerable to this spell. If this spell killed an undead creature, it did not reanimate. Creatures who used infravision were unable to do so for a short period after exposure to the light from this spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component a gem with a value of at least 1000 gp. The gemstone could be red, transparent, or yellow in hue. It was consumed during casting.
