Overland flight was a transmutation spell that functioned like the spell fly, except that it only affected the caster and was slightly slower, but lasted much longer.
Over an eight-hour period, the caster of overland flight could travel up to 64 miles.
The spell required both verbal and somatic components to cast.
Overland flight was a necessary component in the crafting of tapestries of shadowy flight, as well as drow driftdiscs.
