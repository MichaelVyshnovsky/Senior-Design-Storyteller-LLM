        "mainbody": "'''''Mindtouch''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] to probe minds.",
        "Effects": "''Mindtouch'' was similar to ''[[ESP]]'' in that it allowed the caster to read surface thoughts, in the case of intelligent creatures, or emotions and instinctive thoughts, in the case of non-intelligent creatures. Mindless creatures and [[undead]] creatures could not be targeted with this spell.\n\nThe caster's skill determined how long she or he could maintain the ability to read minds and how far a potential target could be away; the latter could never exceed 90 feet (28 meters).\n\nThe caster could change the subject to another within range every minute by concentration. The concentration required to read minds was intense. Lapsing in it or just deciding not to concentrate while the spell was running its duration meant that no benefits could be yielded while the spell ran its course to expiration.\n\nAnother way to use this spell was to use it as a detection spell. Using this spell in this way caused the caster to have an awareness of the existence of other minds. For example, the caster could be warned of an ambush by feeling the mental presence of the unseen ambushers.",
        "Components": "''Mindtouch'' required somatic and verbal components. It also required a holy symbol as a material component.",
        "History": "The spell was associated with the [[drow]]."
