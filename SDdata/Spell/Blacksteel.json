        "mainbody": "'''''Blacksteel''''' was a [[spell]] used to help cloak and conceal weapons.",
        "Effects": "Though this spell could be used on any weapon, it was commonly cast upon metal or bladed weapons. When cast ''blacksteel'' temporarily changed the weapon into a dark and silent tool. Light did not reflect off of a weapon under the effects of this spell, nor did the weapon make any sound when striking another object including if the weapon was shattered or destroyed. Any blood shed from the weapon would adhere to the weapon without spilling or splattering.\n\nThis spell could be used on both magical and mundane weapons. The spell would be terminated if the weapon came into contact with any form of magic.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a pinch of [[iron]] filings and a scrap of cobweb to cast."
