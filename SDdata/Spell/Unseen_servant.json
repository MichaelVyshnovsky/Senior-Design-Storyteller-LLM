It was physically weak and could only lift up to 20 pounds (9 kilogram), but could drag up to 100 pounds (45 kilogram). If brought outside of the spell's range, the servant disappeared.",
        "History": "This spell was created by the [[arcanist]] [[Carbury]] in {{Yearlink|-844}} and was originally known as '''''Carbury's servant'''''.\n\n''Unseen servant'' was an uncommon spell in the Realms by the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''unseen servant'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}",
