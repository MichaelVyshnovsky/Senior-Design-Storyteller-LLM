}}'''''Jackal ward''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This spell protected a wizard from a [[jackal (kit)|jackal]] wizard attempting to steal their spells.

The spell was cast upon a small coin that the caster carried with them. When a jackal wizard tried to steal a spell, the coin warmed quickly, warning the caster of the attempted theft.

This spell always foiled the first attempt to steal a spell. Every attempt thereafter, for the spell's duration, failed half of the time.

==Components==
This spell required a small coin to cast.
