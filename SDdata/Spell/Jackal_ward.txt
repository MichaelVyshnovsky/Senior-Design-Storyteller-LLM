Jackal ward was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell protected a wizard from a jackal wizard attempting to steal their spells.
The spell was cast upon a small coin that the caster carried with them. When a jackal wizard tried to steal a spell, the coin warmed quickly, warning the caster of the attempted theft.
This spell always foiled the first attempt to steal a spell. Every attempt thereafter, for the spells duration, failed half of the time.
This spell required a small coin to cast.
