        "mainbody": "'''''Synaptic static''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that caused an explosion of psychic energy, scrambling the thoughts of everyone caught in the blast.",
        "Effects": "The spell created a {{SIAdj|20|ft}}-radius blast centered on a point of the caster's choice within a range of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}. All creatures within the blast radius who possessed even moderate animal intelligence suffered massive mental damage, and those who could not resist the spell had their thoughts jumbled for up to one minute, considerably impairing all their attempts to perform activities or even concentrate on spells.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
