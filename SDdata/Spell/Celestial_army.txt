Celestial army was an Elven High Magic wizard spell.
This spell was typically used only when the elven homeland was threatened, summoning a great host of beings directly from the Upper Planes to aid the caster. Potential beings summoned by this spell are listed below
* one to three astral devas,
* a single light aasimon,
* three to eighteen Lantern archons,
* one to six sword archons,
* five to twenty bariaurs,
* a single celestial lammasu,
* one to three phoenixes,
* two to twenty Reverend Ones,
* ten to one hundred einheriar, or
* a single adamantine dragon.
The summoned creatures fought until either the battle was won or they were slain. Upon their deaths the creatures vanished along with all of the gear that they carried into combat.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component an altar made from precious metals.
