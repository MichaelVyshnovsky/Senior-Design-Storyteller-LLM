'''''Celestial army''''' was an [[Elven High Magic]] [[wizard]] [[spell]].

==Effects==
This spell was typically used only when the [[elven]] homeland was threatened, summoning a great host of beings directly from the [[Upper Planes]] to aid the caster. Potential beings summoned by this spell are listed below:
* one to three [[astral deva]]s,
* a single [[light aasimon]],
* three to eighteen [[Lantern archon]]s,
* one to six [[sword archon]]s,
* five to twenty [[bariaur]]s,
* a single [[Celestial creature|celestial]] [[lammasu]],
* one to three [[phoenix]]es,
* two to twenty [[Reverend Ones]],
* ten to one hundred [[einheriar]], or
* a single [[adamantine dragon]].

The summoned creatures fought until either the battle was won or they were slain. Upon their deaths the creatures vanished along with all of the gear that they carried into combat.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] an altar made from precious metals.
