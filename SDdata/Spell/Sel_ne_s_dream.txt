'''''Selûne's dream''''' was an ''[[evocation]]'' ''[[cantrip]]'' available to the devotees of [[Selûne]] the Moonmaiden.

==Effects==
The spell of ''Selûne's dream'' allowed the caster to bestow divine healing upon the recipient with a chance of the target falling into a deep, restful slumber.

This spell was ineffective when used against [[undead]] or [[construct]] creatures. The spell's reach was {{SI|4'9|'"|long=yes}}.

==History==
In [[1492 DR]], ''Selûne's dream'' cantrip was tied to a powerful ''[[weave]]''-connected Selûnite necklace, the ''[[amulet of Selûne's chosen]]''. The [[amulet]] originated from the glory days of the [[Shattered Sanctum]], a once great temple stronghold of Selûne, brought to ruin by [[Shar]]'s [[Dark Justiciars]].
