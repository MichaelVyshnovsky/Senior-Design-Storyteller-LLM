        "mainbody": "Create spectral wizard was an unusual necromantic spell used by wizards. This spell was found in Kyristans Mysteries and was developed by the lich Kyristan.\nThis vile spell was used to turn spellcasters into undead spectral wizards. It only worked against humans, elves, and gnomes. If used against an unwilling target there was a chance the target would be able to resist the spells magic, negating the spell.\nAny spellcaster succumbing to the spells magic, either willingly or unwillingly, would be killed and transformed into an unique undead spellcaster. The shock of dying caused these spectral wizards to lose some of their expertise. Spectral wizards were free-willed, but any words from the original caster of the create spectral wizard spell that turned them acted like a powerful suggestion, forcing the undead wizard to obey the casters commands.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a target wizard to cast."
