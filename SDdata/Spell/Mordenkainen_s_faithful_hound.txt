Mordenkainens faithful hound was a conjuration spell that summoned a phantom dog for defense and attack. It was presumably developed by the mage Mordenkainen.
To Zakharan mages, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as faithful hound, and counted among the spells of the universal province.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast Mordenkainens faithful hound within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.
