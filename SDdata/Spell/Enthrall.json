        "mainbody": "Enthrall was an enchantment spell that captivated any number of creatures in a wide area for up to an hour.\nThe caster had to acquire the attention of the group first by making a loud noise, shouting, performing, casting calm chaos, or some other means. Once the audiences attention was focused on the caster, the caster had to speak or sing in a language they could understand for one minute without interruption to cast enthrall. If successful, those that were affected would ignore what was happening around them and give complete attention to the caster whom they regarded with friendship. Beings of great wisdom or experience were only made indifferent to the caster, were still aware of their surroundings, and could possibly break free of the enchantment if they observed events not to their liking. Members of an organization, race, or religion opposed to the caster were particularly difficult to sway.\nThose who were not enthralled could heckle and jeer the caster or try to disrupt the spell using their charisma to undermine the casters message and sway the crowds attitude with derision.\nThe enchantment lasted as long as the caster continued to speak or sing, for up to 1 hour. During the course of the spell, those enthralled took no action, and for a few minutes thereafter while they discussed the topic or performance. Those entering the area during the performance could also be enthralled. The effect ended if the caster lost concentration or performed any action other than speaking or singing.\nHostile action toward any enthralled audience member broke the spell and turned the disposition of the entire audience to be unfriendly towards the caster.\nAfter the Second Sundering the spell only lasted up to a minute and the creature would have difficulty focusing on any one other than the caster.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell, but the verbal component lasted for the duration of the spell."
