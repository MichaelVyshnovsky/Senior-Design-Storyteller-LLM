Sunbolt was an evocation spell that created a burst of sunlight, that struck an area designated by the caster, damaging and temporarily blinding any nearby person or creature.
When this spell was cast, a burst of sunlight discharged in an area 60 (9.1 m) in diameter, within an area that was chosen by the caster. Any being caught within this blast was harmed by the blast and was blinded for a matter of seconds, unless they resisted the spells effects.
This spell was unique to the elves of Evermeet. The specifications of its casting were a well-kept secret of island realm.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small sunstone, worth at least 25 gp.
