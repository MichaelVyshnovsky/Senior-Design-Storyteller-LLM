        "mainbody": "Turtle soup was a wizard spell created by Alustriel Silverhand. In fact, it was the first spell she developed by herself.\nThis spell created a bowl of thick, peppery turtle soup. The volume of the soup matched the casters head. The soup was held in place by the spells dweomer, matching a bowl shape. The soup would endure after the spell expired, though it would behave like a normal liquid at that point and spill if not positioned into a normal container.\nThis nourishing soup matched whatever temperature the caster desired.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required three drops of water and a piece of turtle shell or skin to cast.\n* Both Elminster and Khelben Arunsun knew this spell. Though they most often would cast it to drench the head of an unexpecting foe, rather than using it to gain a meal."
