        "mainbody": "'''''Turtle soup''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] created by [[Alustriel Silverhand]]. In fact, it was the first spell she developed by herself.",
        "Effects": "This spell created a bowl of thick, peppery [[turtle soup]]. The volume of the soup matched the caster's head. The soup was held in place by the spell's dweomer, matching a bowl shape. The soup would endure after the spell expired, though it would behave like a normal liquid at that point and spill if not positioned into a normal container.\n\nThis nourishing soup matched whatever temperature the caster desired.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required three drops of water and a piece of turtle shell or skin to cast.",
        "Notable Users": "* Both [[Elminster]] and [[Khelben Arunsun]] knew this spell. Though they most often would cast it to drench the head of an unexpecting foe, rather than using it to gain a meal.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-10-17 - Alustriel and Turtle Soup}}"
