Sending was a spell unique to Maztica.
A caster used this spell to transmit hishna magic over a great distance. It was generally used for two purposes. The first was as an effective means to send a message to another individual. The message was received telepathically by the recipient, and was one-way only. The second use of this spell was to augment another hishna spell being cast by another hishnashaper. The more powerful caster cast this spell, and the recipient cast another spell. The spell was then amplified in strength greater than the recipients skill level.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component a bone from the leg of a vulture.
