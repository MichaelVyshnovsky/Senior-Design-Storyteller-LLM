Ice spikes was a divine magic spell given to specialty priests of Auril, the Frostmaiden.
When cast, this spell created a ball of hard ice around the casters hand. The ball was covered in sharp spikes of ice, similar to a mace. For the duration of the spell, the casters hand were protected from harm. Due to the nature of the spell, while the spell was in effect, the caster was unable to cast most spells and they were unable to use their hands for anything but the most basic of tasks. The caster could channel some of their life energy into the spell, which increased the damage the ice fists inflicted. 
In addition to somatic and verbal components, this spell required a material component, an icicle or a shaving of ice.
