        "mainbody": "Hunters mark was a simple ranger spell, which could also be cast by paladins who had taken the Oath of Vengeance.\nThe caster could select a target from up to  away, and cast hunters mark upon them. The target was then more susceptible to regular weapon attacks of the caster, hurting them more than normal. The spell lasted for up to an hour, but only if the caster was able to maintain concentration for the long time period. Very experienced spellcasters could maintain the concentration required for the spell for up to a day.\nThe spell only required a verbal component."
