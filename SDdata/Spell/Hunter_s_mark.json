        "mainbody": "'''''Hunter's mark''''' was a simple [[ranger]] [[spell]], which could also be cast by [[paladin]]s who had taken the [[Oath of Vengeance]].",
        "Effects": "The caster could select a target from up to {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} away, and cast ''hunter's mark'' upon them. The target was then more susceptible to regular [[weapon]] attacks of the caster, hurting them more than normal. The spell lasted for up to an hour, but only if the caster was able to maintain concentration for the long time period. Very experienced spellcasters could maintain the concentration required for the spell for up to a day.",
        "Components": "The spell only required a [[verbal component]]."
