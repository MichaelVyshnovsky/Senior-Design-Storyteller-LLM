        "mainbody": "'''''Echo''''' was a rare [[arcane]] [[spell]] from the [[alteration]] and [[evocation]] schools of magic, used to incriminate loose-tongued conspirators or as a way to replay overly-complex instructions or codes by the mages of the world of [[Oerth]].",
        "Effects": "The spell allowed the caster to record all sounds heard by the caster within a minute from before ''echo'' was cast. Once the spell was cast, it retained the recorded sounds indefinitely until they were replayed up to two times. An ''echo'' remained active even if a mage was rendered unconscious or ''[[feeblemind]]ed'', but not death and ''[[resurrection]]''. The replay was activated by the caster's utterance of a command word. The replays were produced at the same volume as they were originally heard by the caster.\n\nSeveral active ''echos'' were available at the same time. However, the mage could not access the part of their mind, their memory, where the memorized spell was stored until the active ''echos'' were released. Unlike many other spells, the only way to release an audible ''echo'' was to replay it twice.",
        "Components": "''Echo'' required [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to be cast.",
        "History": "The ''echo'' spell was known to [[Mordenkainen]] of Greyhawk, and it was among the spells exchanged between the members of [[The Wizards Three]] during their visit to [[Earth]] and raiding larders of [[Ed Greenwood]] of Canada. The spell was brought over to the world of [[Toril]] by [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]], a member of the same de facto group.{{Cite dragon/242/Jest the Wizards Three|50}}"
