        "mainbody": "Echo was a rare arcane spell from the alteration and evocation schools of magic, used to incriminate loose-tongued conspirators or as a way to replay overly-complex instructions or codes by the mages of the world of Oerth.\nThe spell allowed the caster to record all sounds heard by the caster within a minute from before echo was cast. Once the spell was cast, it retained the recorded sounds indefinitely until they were replayed up to two times. An echo remained active even if a mage was rendered unconscious or feebleminded, but not death and resurrection. The replay was activated by the casters utterance of a command word. The replays were produced at the same volume as they were originally heard by the caster.\nSeveral active echos were available at the same time. However, the mage could not access the part of their mind, their memory, where the memorized spell was stored until the active echos were released. Unlike many other spells, the only way to release an audible echo was to replay it twice.\nEcho required verbal and somatic components to be cast.\nThe echo spell was known to Mordenkainen of Greyhawk, and it was among the spells exchanged between the members of The Wizards Three during their visit to Earth and raiding larders of Ed Greenwood of Canada. The spell was brought over to the world of Toril by Elminster of Shadowdale, a member of the same de facto group."
