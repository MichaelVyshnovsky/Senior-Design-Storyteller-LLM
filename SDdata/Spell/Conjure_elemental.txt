Conjure elemental was a conjuration/summoning spell that allowed a wizard to call and control either an air, earth, fire or water elemental.
The type of elemental needed to be fixed during memorization and each required a different material component and a certain amount of the respective element. The spell always carried a certain risk that the conjured elemental would break free. A protection from evil provided a defense in that case.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, and the element in question, casting this spell required a small amount of burning incense to conjure an air elemental, of soft clay for an earth elemental, of sulfur and phosphorus for a fire elemental, and water and sand for a water elemental.
The conjure elemental spell was first introduced in the time of Netheril, in 2131 NY (âˆ’1728 DR), under the name Tipalds conjuration, after the arcanist Tipald.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast conjure elemental within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.
Conjure elemental was commonly known and used by the magical community by 1358 DR.
