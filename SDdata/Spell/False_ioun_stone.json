        "mainbody": "'''''False ioun stone''''' was a rare [[arcane]] [[spell]] from the [[alteration]] and [[illusion]] schools of magic, used by [[wizard]]ly charlatans on the world of [[Oerth]] to create shallow copies of ''[[ioun stone]]s''.\n\n{{quote|Before entering studies under Lord [[Mordenkainen]], my career tended toward ... deception.|Lady [[Rautheene]] of Oerth}}",
        "Effects": "''False ioun stone'' was a spell from the first circle of magic that could create an illusion with a mere touch of the spellcaster. The mage could transform normal stones and pebbles into perfect copies of ''ioun stones'' they have had encountered in the past. The illusion created copies that looked and behaved identical to ''ioun stones'' but possessed no [[enchantment]]s, floating around a person's head, and could be touched, moved, or repositioned without the spell being ruined and ruse discovered. These fakes also radiated appropriate magics, making the charade complete. The spell could create between one and three copies, depending on the number of [[material component]]s used. If the spell was cast on a pebble by a mage who had never seen a real ''ioun stone'', it produced a vibrant purple prism or a dusty rosy prism as the first item, a pearly white spindle or a lavender-and-green ellipsoid as the second, and a random stone as the third.\n\nThe illusion persisted for one minute, and its duration increased with the spellcaster's magical prowess.",
        "Components": "''False ioun stone'' required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and material components to be cast. Its material components were stones that served as the spell's targets, a handful of worthless [[glass]] beads, and a transparent [[gem]], one per number of ''false ioun stones'' created. Once the spell was over, all components were consumed.",
        "History": "The ''false ioun stone'' spell was known to [[Rautheene]] of Greyhawk and it was among the spells exchanged between the members of [[The Wizards Three]] during their visit to [[Earth]] and raiding larders of [[Ed Greenwood]] of Canada. The spell was brought over to the world of [[Toril]] by [[Elminster]] of [[Shadowdale]], a members of the same de facto group.{{Cite dragon/242/Jest the Wizards Three|50}}"
