        "mainbody": "False ioun stone was a rare arcane spell from the alteration and illusion schools of magic, used by wizardly charlatans on the world of Oerth to create shallow copies of ioun stones.\nFalse ioun stone was a spell from the first circle of magic that could create an illusion with a mere touch of the spellcaster. The mage could transform normal stones and pebbles into perfect copies of ioun stones they have had encountered in the past. The illusion created copies that looked and behaved identical to ioun stones but possessed no enchantments, floating around a persons head, and could be touched, moved, or repositioned without the spell being ruined and ruse discovered. These fakes also radiated appropriate magics, making the charade complete. The spell could create between one and three copies, depending on the number of material components used. If the spell was cast on a pebble by a mage who had never seen a real ioun stone, it produced a vibrant purple prism or a dusty rosy prism as the first item, a pearly white spindle or a lavender-and-green ellipsoid as the second, and a random stone as the third.\nThe illusion persisted for one minute, and its duration increased with the spellcasters magical prowess.\nFalse ioun stone required verbal, somatic, and material components to be cast. Its material components were stones that served as the spells targets, a handful of worthless glass beads, and a transparent gem, one per number of false ioun stones created. Once the spell was over, all components were consumed.\nThe false ioun stone spell was known to Rautheene of Greyhawk and it was among the spells exchanged between the members of The Wizards Three during their visit to Earth and raiding larders of Ed Greenwood of Canada. The spell was brought over to the world of Toril by Elminster of Shadowdale, a members of the same de facto group."
