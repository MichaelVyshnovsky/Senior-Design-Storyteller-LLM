        "mainbody": "Telepathic aura was a divine divination spell used by paladins that allowed the caster to connect with their companions telepathically.\nTelepathic aura only allowed one-way communication where the caster could send thoughts to companions within range, but the companions could not reply with their own thoughts.\nThis spell required only somatic components to cast.\nTelepathic aura was found within a spellbook from the Church of the Red Knight called Master Tactician."
