Cetacean form was a spell used by clerics of Deep Sashelas.
When cast, this spell acted in a similar fashion to the arcane spell shapechange. Unlike that spell, cetacean form only allowed the caster to assume the form of cetacean species such as dolphins, narwhals, porpoises and whales. However, they could assume the form of a giant whale or leviathan. The caster gains all the natural abilities and vulnerabilities of their chosen form. While the spell was in effect, the caster could change their form multiple times. If killed while in their new form, their body did not return to its natural state.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Deep Sashelas and a piece of ambergris.
