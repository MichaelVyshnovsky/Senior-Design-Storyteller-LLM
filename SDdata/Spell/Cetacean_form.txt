'''''Cetacean form''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Deep Sashelas]].
 
==Effects==
When cast, this spell acted in a similar fashion to the [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spell ''[[shapechange]]''. Unlike that spell, ''cetacean form'' only allowed the caster to assume the form of cetacean species such as [[dolphin]]s, [[narwhal]]s, [[porpoise]]s and [[whale]]s. However, they could assume the form of a [[giant whale]] or [[leviathan (creature)|leviathan]]. The caster gains all the natural abilities and vulnerabilities of their chosen form. While the spell was in effect, the caster could change their form multiple times. If killed while in their new form, their body did not return to its natural state.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Deep Sashelas and a piece of [[ambergris]].
