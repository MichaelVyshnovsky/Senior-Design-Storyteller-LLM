        "mainbody": "Teleport dead was an alteration and necromancy spell that could instantly transport a single dead or undead body to anywhere on the plane of the caster.\nThe oldest version of this spell was easier to learn and only worked on the undead. The newer version was more difficult to learn but also worked on an unanimated corpse and could be used to remove a fallen comrade from the battlefield to a safer location. The caster had to touch the corpse or undead creature (including gaseous vampires, specters, and other intangible undead). All undead creatures had a chance to resist the magic of this spell and, if successful, remained in place. Spellcasting undead had a much better chance of resisting this spell.\nAccuracy was the same as for the teleport spell and improved with increasing familiarity of the destination. Arriving high meant a fall of 10 ft (3 m) at the very least, while arriving low meant 10 ft (3 m) underground and was usually, though not necessarily, \"fatal\" to an undead creature. The caster could not choose to teleport high or low on purpose but had to choose a solid surface with a reasonable amount open space on which to land.\nMost of the Realms considered teleporting an undead creature into an enemys house or castle to be an act of evil.\nA lich or other undead with spellcasting ability could use this spell to teleport itself.\nOnly verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.\nThis spell was published in \"Volos Guide to All Things Magical\" and became generally known to the magical community."
