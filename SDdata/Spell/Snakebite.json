        "mainbody": "Snakebite was a transmutation spell used by druids and rangers.\nThis spell transformed one of the casters arms into a slithering fanged snake. A bite from the casters snake arm inflicted physical damage from the fangs and the venom had a chance of paralyzing the target for several minutes.\nThe caster was unable to perform any other actions with the snake arm, but could perform all of their normal activities with the other arm, including casting spells that required only somatic components.\nThe caster could only be under the effect of a single snakebite spell at a time.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
