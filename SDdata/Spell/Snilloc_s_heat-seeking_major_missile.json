        "mainbody": "'''''Snilloc's heat-seeking major missile''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that worked similarly to ''[[Snilloc's major missile]]'', but did not require visual contact between the caster and the target.",
        "Effects": "The spell created missiles of magical energy that flew from the caster's fingertips towards a target within a range of {{SI|60|yd|long=yes}}, in a similar way to the darts created by the ''[[magic missile]]'' spell. The damage caused by the darts and their range increased as the caster became more powerful.\n\nUnlike ''snilloc's major missile'' and ''magic missile'', the spell did not require the caster to be able to see the intended target.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.",
        "History": "The spell was developed as a minor modification of [[Snilloc]]'s original spell by the blind [[drow]] [[wizard]] [[Dostrealt]], who had developed and collected a number of spells that did not rely on eyesight, so that his spellcasting ability was not hindered by his disability."
