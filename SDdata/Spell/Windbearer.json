        "mainbody": "Windbearer was a divine evocation spell used by specialty priests devoted to Akadi, enabling them to create a pillar of air.\nThis spell created a pillar of air with a  diameter. The height of the pillar and the amount of upward force generated by the pillar was determined by the priests skill. The pillar could lift creatures and objects to its top if it was strong enough to overcome their weight. The height of the pillar could be adjusted with the casters concentration.\nIn addition to verbal components, this spell required as a material component the priests holy symbol to cast."
