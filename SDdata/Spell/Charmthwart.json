For its duration, they were protected against charm magic to which they were previously susceptible. The spell could be prematurely ended the will of the caster.\nThis spell only required somatic components to cast.\nDeveloped by the wizard Sammaster during his early years training in the Art, the discovery of this spell was the result of arcane experimentation. This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
