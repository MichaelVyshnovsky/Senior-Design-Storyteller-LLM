        "mainbody": "'''''Reanimation''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] and [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "A caster used this spell to reanimate a recently slain creature. The creature was reanimated into a state of pseudo-[[undead|undeath]]. The abilities of the reanimated creature were very limited. The target creature was unable to engage in melee combat, use weapons or use spells. The creature moved very slowly and had little to no language skills. The creature's memories were damaged and unfocused. They tended to wander off if the caster was not paying attention to its movements. The reanimated creature required no rest or substance of any kind. If the creature was killed, the caster could cast the spell again, if necessary. ''[[Limited wish]]'', ''[[raise dead]]'', ''[[resurrection]]'', and ''[[wish]]'' returned the reanimated creature to normal function. ''[[Greater restoration]]'' restored the creature's memory.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s. A wu jen needed a [[amulet]] of [[gold]] shaped like a [[phoenix]], [[incense]] and a shawl, preferably white. A shugenja required a piece of white cloth, incense and the symbol of their deity."
