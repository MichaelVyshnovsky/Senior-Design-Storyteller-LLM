        "mainbody": "'''Bladesingers''' were [[elven]] wizards who practiced the sacred art of '''bladesinging''', an ancient and sacred tradition of fighting that blended [[sword]]smanship, along with other fighting styles, and unique [[arcane magic]]. These individuals were revered by their fellow elves as personifications of the perfect balance between skilled artistry and devotion to the guardianship of their people.\n\n{{Quote|Using his free hand, the bladesinger mirrored his opponent's casting then sent his considerable power out to surround the overmatched wizard, binding it to himself. Argent energy flew from the human's outstretched hand only to fizzle unto nothingness as the bladesinger quenched the spell. }}",
        "Culture": {
            "Orders": "In the centuries prior to the [[Retreat]], bladesingers of [[Evermeet]] formed small warrior lodges, with each individual member specializing in a [[Bladesinger#Styles|different weapon]]. They distinguished themselves from other orders by arming themselves with the most antiquated weapons and tattoos of ancient elven [[rune]]s, rather than animals.Unfortunately many of their numbers dwindled during the first few decades of the [[Era of Upheaval]].\n\nIn the [[Arcane Ages]], bladesingers served both as [[armathor]]s of [[Myth Drannor]] as well as a unit of elite warriors within the [[Ahk'Velahr]] known as the [[Protectors]]. They specialized as bodyguards for the city's nobility, as well as defenders against great, [[magic]]al monsters such as [[demon]]s and [[dragon]]s. In ancient texts it was mentioned they even invented their own [[spell]]s.\n\nThe [[Weavers of Bladesong]] was a group that served as a dedicated order of [[Corellon Larethian]]."
        },
        "Activities": {
            "Combat": "In battle, bladesingers utilized discrete tactics and precise movement to maintain a highly effective defensive posture. Wielding a one-handed blade while keeping the other hand free, allowed a bladesinger to parley that defense into powerful attacks that were empowered by their unique magic."
        },
        "Abilities": {
            "Bladesong": "When novices began their tutelage under experienced bladesingers, they could maintain their bladesong for about a minute's time, two times every day.\n\nOver time they learned how to further modify the magic of their bladesong in order to better suit their needs. These songs were often presented in pairs that shared some close association with one another. \n\nA ''song of defense'' a bladesinger could actually negate harm inflicted upon them, while  ''song of victory'' allowed them to attack with greater power. \n\nWhen performing a ''song of celerity'' a bladesinger was empowered to cast a spell with great quickness, while the ''song of fury'' allowed them to make a swift, \"arcane strike\" against their foe. With the ''choir of swords'' a bladesinger could strike out against every opponent near them, with similar blinding speed.",
            "Styles": "[[File:Bladesinger by Ginger Kubic.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''A practitioner of one of the \"cat styles\" of bladesinging.'']]\nWhile bladesinging has traditionally been tied to the use of a [[longsword]], different techniques utilizing a variety of weapons have developed throughout the years. Each type of weapon was associated with an animal group, with more specific weapons linked to species of that animal.\n\n* Cat: Practitioners of this family of bladesinging wielded swords in battle. The oldest tradition was the \"lion style\", which was practiced with the [[longsword]] but held no preference for a particular [[school of magic]]. Those who studied in the \"leopard style\" preferred [[short sword]]s and [[illusion]] or stealth-oriented spells, while the \"red tiger style\" bladesingers wielded [[scimitar]]s in movements that alternated between whirls and lunges.\n\n* Bird: While these newer styles were quite different from one another, they each made use of a weapon with a handled shaft. The \"eagle style\" focused on fluidity in combat, involving a pair of small [[handaxe]]s; whereas bladesingers of the \"raven style\" made use of a [[pick]] and spells that made them more dexterous.\n\n* Snake: Another of the older style families, each of its styles utilized a weapon whose shape would change in combat, such as a [[flail]] or [[chain]]. For example, practitioners of the \"viper style\" employed the use of [[whip]]s in their bladesinging, along with particularly wicked spells that made use of [[poison]] and [[disease]].",
            "Bladespells": "In addition to their skill with a weapon and inherent spellcasting powers, bladesingers gained access to a number of unique spells. Among these spells were: ''[[dancing fire (bladespell)|dancing fire]]'', ''[[dazzling sunray]]'', ''[[frost bite]]'', ''[[lightning ring (bladespell)|lightning ring]]'', ''[[shadow sever]]'', ''[[unseen hand]]'', ''[[dimension switch]]'', ''[[force volley]]'', and ''[[black fire]]''.\n\nSome of the most powerful bladesingers could let chain the effects of their spells as they reached the crescendo of battle."
        },
        "Possessions": "As was the case with other [[wizard]]s, bladesingers still kept a [[spellbook]] within which they inscribed their spells for the day.\n\nUnlike other spellcasters they could use their primary weapon, typically a one-handed [[blade]], as their [[implement]].",
        "History": "[[File:Bladesingers train.jpg|thumb|''Two bladesingers in training.''|317x317px]]\nIt was said that the [[moon elves]] were the first of the Tel-quessir to develop the art of bladesinging.\n\nNew styles of bladesinging were continually in development throughout the years. One of the more recent styles came to use as recently as the 12{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nDuring the great [[Retreat]], which began in the {{YearlinkName|1344}}, many bladesingers dedicated their efforts to the safety of those elves who remained in the lands beyond Evermeet.\n\nThe culture and practice of bladesinging in Faer√ªn enjoyed a great rebirth in the years following the re-connection between [[Toril]] and the [[Feywild]]. The eladrin bladesingers in the Feywild brought their tradition to the elves of the Realms, and the ranks of the bladesingers swelled among the [[sun elf]] and moon elf communities.",
        "Members": "Nearly all of the bladesingers were either elves or eladrin, along with a select few number of [[half-elves]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Elven legends stated that [[Corellon]] actually taught the art of bladesinging to its first practitioner.",
        "Notable Bladesingers": "* [[Glorantha Steelrain]], an adventuring bladesinger who worked for betterment of the elvenkind in the 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Istvelen]], an eladrin who was known to be one of the very first bladesingers.\n* [[Josidiah Starym]], an adventurer from Myth Drannor who famously recovered the lost ''[[Artblade]]'' of [[Cormanthyr]]."
