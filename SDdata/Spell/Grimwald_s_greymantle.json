        "mainbody": "'''''Grimwald's greymantle''''' was an [[arcane]] [[necromancy]] spell that prevented healing or regeneration effects from working on a single creature for a short time.",
        "Description": "The caster imbued the material component of this spell (a bone, small skull, or small animal skeleton) with a silver-gray glow which immediately had to come in contact with the target. If successful, the radiance was transferred to the target and enveloped it like a mantle. While surrounded by this aura, the target could not repair damage or regain health by any means, including healing spells such as ''[[cure light wounds]]'' and ''[[heal]]''; a ''[[potion of healing]]''; a ''[[staff of curing]]''; or regeneration effects such as a ''[[regenerate|regeneration]]'' spell, a ''[[ring of regeneration]]'', or a natural ability such as that possessed by [[troll]]s. ''Grimwald's graymantle'' lasted for a short time corresponding to the level of the caster. If it expired or was dispelled, any healing or regenerative effect still in place on the target creature began working again. The target got one chance to resist the spell, in which case it faded harmlessly away.\n\nThis spell was modified a few times in its history, making it less dangerous for the caster and improving the range at which it operated. For the original version, the caster had to wield the bone, skull, or skeleton like a [[dagger]] or a [[club]] and successfully hit the target, presumably in melee combat. If the caster missed his or her attack at the time of casting and again at the next opportunity to strike, then the gray aura spread to the caster and he or she could receive no healing until ''Grimwald's greymantle'' was dispelled or expired. The next version of this spell allowed the caster to throw the bone or skull up to 5 yd (4.6 m) per level of the caster at the target and avoid the ill effects of a failed attack. The newest version increased this range to 100 ft (30 m) plus 10 ft (3 m) per level of the caster.\n\nThis spell did not interfere with curing of [[Remove disease|disease]], [[Remove blindness or deafness|blindness, or deafness]], nor did it prevent ''[[inflict light wounds|cause wound]]'' spells.",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small bone or skull to charge with the gray aura. The original version also allowed for a small animal skeleton to be used.",
        "History": "''Grimwald's greymantle'' was originally published in the \"[[Tome of the Covenant]]\" to commemorate the founding of [[the Covenant]]{{Cite dragon/92/Pages from the Mages III|38}} in the [[673 DR|Year of the Covenant, 673 DR]]. The second version was later published in \"[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]\" and became generally known to the magical community."
