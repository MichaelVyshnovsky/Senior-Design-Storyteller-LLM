Deathshroud was an arcane spell from the school of necromancy that surrounded the caster with life-draining magic from the Negative Energy plane.
The undead and magical constructs were not affected by a deathshroud, but anyone else coming into contact with it were physically drained of energy by a death haze that would kill them within minutes. The spells duration lasted for several minutes depending on the casters skill.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a crushed black opal and diamond worth 5,000 gp, dust from an incorporeal undead with ties to the Negative Energy plane, and a chunk of smoky quartz to cast. All components were consumed during the casting.
This spell was found within the Book of Shadows, a tome based upon the oration of the necromancer Nebt Bhakau of Zakhara.
