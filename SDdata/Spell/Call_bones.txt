'''''Call bones''''' was an obscure yet lethal [[elven]] spell.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|189-190|9}}

==Effects==
When the spell was cast, any of the target's bones that the caster chose simply tore free of their meat and floated quickly towards the caster. Doing this to a living person's skull was bound to kill them.

==History==
The spell had been developed by [[Napraeleon Echorn]] to more efficiently part meat from bones when working on larger prey, eight or seven centuries prior to the year {{yearlink|241}}, in roughly {{yearlink|-500}}. In {{yearlink|241}}, his descendant, [[Delmuth Echorn]], attempted to use it in order to slay [[Elminster Aumar]]. The spell was reflected, killing Delmuth and turning his skull into a hazard that Elminster reflected with his shield; the skull was still flying fast enough to strike a distant person some time later, [[Athtar Nlossae]], and kill him.

The sorceress [[Dasumia]] used a similar spell to slay the [[Chosen of Mystra]] [[Nadrathen]] during her takeover of [[Galadorna]] in {{yearlink|764}}, though her version pushed the bones out and made them fall to the ground, rather than attract them violently.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|623|8}} Elminster later used a perfected version of a similar spell in {{yearlink|1479}}, deboning a number of [[Cormyrean]] nobles in protection of their king, [[Foril Obarskyr I]].{{cite book/Bury Elminster Deep||10}}
