'''''Detect disease''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s and [[shugenja]].

==Effects==
This spell allowed a caster to determine if a creature was infected or carrying a disease. The spell was able to detect [[lycanthropy]], [[mummy rot]], and other magical diseases. It also allowed the caster to determine whether the detected disease was able to be cured by the caster.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a symbol of the caster's [[deity]]. The spell used by shugenja required a wand made from [[bamboo]] with strips of [[paper]] attached to it. These strips had prayers written on them.
