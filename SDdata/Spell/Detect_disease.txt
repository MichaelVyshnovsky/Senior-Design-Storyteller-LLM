Detect disease was a common spell used by clerics and shugenja.
This spell allowed a caster to determine if a creature was infected or carrying a disease. The spell was able to detect lycanthropy, mummy rot, and other magical diseases. It also allowed the caster to determine whether the detected disease was able to be cured by the caster.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a symbol of the casters deity. The spell used by shugenja required a wand made from bamboo with strips of paper attached to it. These strips had prayers written on them.
