        "mainbody": "Glorious transmutation was a powerful alteration spell used by wizards.\nThis spell allowed the caster to permanently turn either iron into silver or lead into gold as chosen by the caster.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a philosophers stone to cast. The stone was alchemically combined with the metal at the time of casting. A new stone was needed the next time the wizard wished to cast the spell. For the spell to work the caster needed to know the formula for mixing the philosophers stone with the metal. The amount of material transformed depended on the quality of the philosophers stone."
