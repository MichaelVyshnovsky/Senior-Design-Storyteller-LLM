Aegis was a powerful defensive spell from the abjuration school, used by sorcerers, wizards, and Watchers of Helm.
When the spell was cast, it wrapped the caster in magical protection. It granted the caster resistance to acid, cold, fire, and electricity gave them physical protection, similar to the shield spell gave them limited resistance to magic, increased reactions, and protection from domination, or other types of harm and gave them the effects of the stoneskin, lesser globe of invulnerability, and freedom of movement spells. This mighty protection lasted for 60 seconds.
