'''''Aegis''''' was a powerful defensive [[spell]] from the [[abjuration]] school, used by [[sorcerer]]s, [[wizard]]s, and [[Watcher (specialty priest)|Watcher]]s of [[Helm]].

==Description==
When the spell was cast, it wrapped the caster in magical protection. It granted the caster resistance to [[acid]], cold, fire, and electricity; gave them physical protection, similar to the ''[[shield]]'' spell; gave them limited resistance to magic, increased reactions, and protection from domination, or other types of harm; and gave them the effects of the ''[[stoneskin]]'', ''[[lesser globe of invulnerability]]'', and ''[[freedom of movement]]'' spells. This mighty protection lasted for 60 seconds.
