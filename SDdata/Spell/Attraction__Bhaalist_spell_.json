        "mainbody": "'''''Attraction''''' was a [[divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that was granted to [[specialty priest]]s of [[Bhaal]], up until the [[Time of Troubles]]. It removed any negative feelings the target had towards the caster and replaced them with favorable emotions. The reverse of this spell, '''''[[disdain]]''''', reversed feelings in the opposite manner.\n\nThis spell was commonly used by [[Church of Bhaal|Bhaalists]] to counteract the air of death that constantly surrounded them.",
