Monstrous regeneration was a conjuration spell used by clerics.
This spell allowed the caster to confer a regenerative ability to a touched creature. Though the spell duration was typically not long enough to usually allow the creature to regrow a severed limb, a severed limb could be held against the wound and reattach itself.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
