        "mainbody": "Divine magic (the Power) was magic granted from prayer to the gods. Practitioners of divine magic were known as divine spellcasters.\nWhile divine magic could not function without the Weave, spellcasters who used divine magic had no ability to manipulate the Weave directly. Clerics, druids, rangers, paladins, and blackguards predominantly used this type of magic. Although in actuality, druids received their power directly from their patron deities, they often thought of this power as coming through nature. Only deities with a direct tie to nature could provide spell power to druids.\nWhen divine spellcasters used such magical power granted them by the gods, often a tangible feeling of appreciation was felt by the caster, manifesting in different ways depending on the patron of the practitioner."
