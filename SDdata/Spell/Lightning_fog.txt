'''''Lightning fog''''' was a spell available to [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s that created a smoky cloud, 20 ft in radius, that was full of electrical charges. Any creature caught within this cloud would be damaged by the errant arcs. A strong wind, whether magical or natural, could dissipate a cloud of lightning fog.
