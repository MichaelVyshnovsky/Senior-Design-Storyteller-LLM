        "mainbody": "'''''Evolve''''' was a powerful [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that forced an animal to permanently change into an intelligent [[humanoid]].",
        "Effects": "The target of this spell was loyal to the caster, allowing the caster to create a veritable army of servants with enough patience. This spell only functioned on normal animals. The transformation caused the animal to grow or shrink to [[human]] size and shape. Normal intelligence and the ability to speak developed as well. The new creature could have special non-magical abilities based upon their abilities as an animal. For example, a [[spider]] might end up having a venomous bite in their ''evolved'' state.\n\nThe ''evolution'' process took a full day to complete once the spell was cast. Only a ''[[wish]]'' or divine intervention could reverse the process.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a subject animal, a bit of organic material from the caster, a [[pearl]] worth at least 500 [[gp]], and a miniature tool to cast. All of the components were consumed during the casting.",
        "History": "This spell was included in ''[[Kyristan's Mysteries]]''."
