        "mainbody": "A '''tradesman''', also known as a '''flying fish''', was a very common [[Spelljammer|spelljamming]] ship found in [[Realmspace]] and surrounding [[crystal sphere]]s.<ref>",
        "Description": "A tradesman was a small, fish-shaped ship. Its [[spelljamming helm]] was located on the aft section. It could be either above its gravity plane, or, in dangerous situations, be flipped upside down. A ship needed a minimum crew of ten individuals in order to work properly and could support a maximum compliment of 25 creatures without compromising its air supply.\n\nTradesmen were short-ranged vessels typically employed by merchants in interplanetary travel. Slightly modified, more heavily armed versions were also frequently used as [[pirate]] ships that preyed on other tradesmen and [[galleon]]s.\n\n[[File:Spelljammer battle.png|thumb|left|250px|''A tradesman being broadsided by another vessel.'']]\nTradesmen were relatively cheap to build and easy to maintain. For that reason, they were the preferred first vessel acquired by adventurers and were used by crews of all races, such as [[human]]s, [[lizardfolk]], [[elves]], [[dwarves]], [[gnome]]s, and even [[mind flayer]]s and other typically non-spacefaring races.",
        "History": "Sometime in the distant past, a tradesman with a human crew and a trading ship with a darven crew and [[orc]] prisoners were attacked by [[illithid]]s near [[Glyth]] while en route to [[Selûne (moon)|Selûne]]. Managing to escape after taking heavy damage, the ships made an emergency landing on [[Chandos]]. The dangerous ever-shifting terrain destroyed both ships and left the occupants marooned on the planet."
