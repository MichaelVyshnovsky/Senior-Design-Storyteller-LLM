}}'''''Summon fire dragons''''' was a [[spell]] used commonly in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
The name of this spell was a little misleading considering that it did not summon any kind of creature. Instead it allowed the caster to create up to 10 fiery snake-like tongues of flame that were called ''fire dragons'' or ''flame dragons''. Each ''fire dragon'' measured 6 ft. (1.8 m) in diameter and moved according to the will of the caster so long as they concentrated. The ''flame dragons'' would dissipate if the caster was struck or their attention was diverted in another manner. Additionally, each ''flame dragon'' could stretch across 180 ft. (55 m) of ground and reach 30 ft. (9 m) into the air.

''Fire dragons'' could not strike against anything standing in water or anything situated higher than 30 ft. off of the ground.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] components, this spell required a strip of [[paper]] that was soaked in [[oil]], [[coal]], [[saltpeter]], and [[sulfur]] to cast.
