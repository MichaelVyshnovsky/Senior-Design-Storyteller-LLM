Instead, psionic invisibility seems to have replaced by the new cloud mind and mass cloud mind powers. While officially removed from 3.x rules, psionic invisibility is documented here for reference.",

        "mainbody": "Invisibility was a psionic power of the telepathy or psychokinesis disciplines that concealed the subject from being seen by others. Although similar to the magical invisibility spell in many ways, the telepathic version had a key difference it affected the very minds of witnesses to a subject, not the light between them or other physical signs of their presence. Hence it was weaker in some areas but more potent in others. The later psychokinetic version was much more like its magical counterpart.\nAfter making contact with the minds of witnesses and creating a delusion, the manifester or their chosen subjects became invisible to their sight. Early on, the effectiveness of this was limited by the manifesters ability and the comparative experience of the witnesses a witness more powerful than the manifester could still see the subject. Later, the invisible being must be human-sized or smaller. The manifester also must specifically choose the minds of those they wished to be invisible from, within , which could increase risk of failure or the cost of psionic energy, but others could still see them easily. An invisible being could still see their own person, of course. This form of invisibility only affected vision. Other senses, like hearing or touch, were unaffected.\nHowever, the invisible subject was difficult to detect using any kind of magic, A mind bar power was needed to shield the mind to reveal the invisibility.\nThe manifester, or a creature or object they touched, disappeared from all sight, even darkvision. Not even the manifester could see another theyd made invisible. Everything they carried became invisible too, but picked up items remained visible unless hidden in a pocket, and discarded items or things held more  way became visible again. While light sources might be made invisible, their illumination remained. Furthermore, the invisible subject could still be heard, leave footprints, or make other signs of their presence.\nIt lasted twenty minutes, or longer for more experienced manifesters, unless dismissed earlier. The invisibility also ended if the subject directly attacked another, but otherwise they could perform almost any other action.\nIt could require contact and mindlink to learn.\nUnlike most powers, but appropriate to its nature, the psychokinetic invisibility had no display.\nPsionic invisibility was known by baku, hauns, and shedu.\nIn psionics terms, invisibility was known by duergar, and the psychokinetic version by intellect devourers.\nAn astral construct could be created that was permanently invisible.\n* Ryvvik Dlardrageth, daemonfey psionicist and third-in-command of House Dlardrageth"
