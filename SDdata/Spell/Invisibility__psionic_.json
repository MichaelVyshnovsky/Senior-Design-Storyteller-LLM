        "mainbody": "'''''Invisibility''''' was a [[psionic]] power of the [[telepathy]] or [[psychokinesis]] [[discipline]]s that concealed the subject from being seen by others. Although similar to the magical ''[[invisibility]]'' [[spell]] in many ways, the telepathic version had a key difference: it affected the very minds of witnesses to a subject, not the light between them or other physical signs of their presence. Hence it was weaker in some areas but more potent in others. The later psychokinetic version was much more like its magical counterpart.",
        "Effects": {
            "Telepathic": "After making contact with the minds of witnesses and creating a delusion, the manifester or their chosen subjects became invisible to their sight. Early on, the effectiveness of this was limited by the manifester's ability and the comparative experience of the witnesses; a witness more powerful than the manifester could still see the subject. Later, the invisible being must be [[human]]-sized or smaller. The manifester also must specifically choose the minds of those they wished to be invisible from, within {{SI|100|yard|long=yes}}, which could increase risk of failure or the cost of psionic energy, but others could still see them easily. An invisible being could still see their own person, of course. This form of ''invisibility'' only affected vision. Other senses, like hearing or touch, were unaffected.\n\nHowever, the invisible subject was difficult to detect using any kind of [[magic]], A ''[[mind bar]]'' power was needed to shield the mind to reveal the invisibility.",
            "Psychokinetic": "The manifester, or a creature or object they touched, disappeared from all sight, even [[darkvision]]. Not even the manifester could see another they'd made invisible. Everything they carried became invisible too, but picked up items remained visible unless hidden in a pocket, and discarded items or things held more {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} way became visible again. While light sources might be made invisible, their illumination remained. Furthermore, the invisible subject could still be heard, leave footprints, or make other signs of their presence.\n\nIt lasted twenty minutes, or longer for more experienced manifesters, unless dismissed earlier. The ''invisibility'' also ended if the subject directly attacked another, but otherwise they could perform almost any other action."

        "Prerequisite Powers": "It could require ''[[contact]]'' and ''[[mindlink]]'' to learn.",
        "Displays": "Unlike most powers, but appropriate to its nature, the psychokinetic ''invisibility'' had no [[display]].",
        "Users": "Psionic ''invisibility'' was known by [[baku]], [[haun]]s, and [[shedu]].\n\nIn psionics terms, ''invisibility'' was known by [[duergar]], and the psychokinetic version by [[intellect devourer]]s.\n\nAn [[astral construct]] could be created that was permanently invisible.",
