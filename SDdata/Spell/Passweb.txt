'''''Passweb''''' was a single-target [[spell]] that allowed the target to pass through [[magic|magical]] and natural webs, tough [[rope]], and organic vines.

==Effects==
The spell would allow the caster, or target, to pass through many types of web-like material, including magical webs acting as gates. The caster could also attempt to free a captive entangled in the web-like material. However, if the captive chose to stay entangled, they would remain so. The structure of the webs would not change in shape or form when passed through.

The [[cleric]] version of this spell differed by having a shorter casting time.

==Components==
Only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components were required to cast this spell.
