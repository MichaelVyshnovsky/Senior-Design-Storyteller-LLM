'''''Spark''''' was a personal [[cantrip]] that beginning [[wizard]]s could learn. It created a big blue bolt of electricity at a location chosen by the caster.

==Effects==
The caster could choose any point within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} for the spark to appear.<ref group="note">The original description of this cantrip in [[Dragon magazine 100|''Dragon'' #100]] gave an increasing range based on the level of the caster, and high-level casters could create multiple sparks in quick succession at the target location. Creatures targeted by ''spark'' had a chance to resist the magic of the spell and, if successful, received only an uncomfortable shock, otherwise, they suffered minimal damage. Metals and other conductive materials could transmit the energy released, therefore, a person wearing metal armor was slightly more likely to be shocked. However, if the target creature was very near death, this cantrip could not finish them off.<ref group="note">This caveat was added in the ''[[Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four]]''. Atmospheric conditions, such as dry air, humidity, or a nearby storm, had no effect on the size or puissance of the spark.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster simultaneously snapped their fingers and made a popping sound.

==History==
This cantrip was invented by [[Sabirine]], a mage who supported the use and improvement of cantrips. ''Spark'' was recorded in the tome known as ''[[Sabirine's Specular]]'', along with ''[[catfeet]]'' and ''[[snatch]]''.
