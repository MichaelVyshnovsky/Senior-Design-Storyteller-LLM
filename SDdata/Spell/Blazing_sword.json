The spell increased the damage inflicted by the sword. When the spell expired, the sword was usually ruined. This spell was a stronger version of sparkling sword.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a small amount of sulfur. The sulfur was tossed onto the weapon during casting."
