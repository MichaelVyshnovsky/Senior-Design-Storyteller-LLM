Sighing chain was an alteration and evocation wizard spell.
This spell created a chain of magical force that coiled around a single target. The sighing chain would actually make a sighing sound as it wound around the target, giving the spell its name.
The target of the chain was able to move about and perform normal physical functions, but all of their movements were hindered or sluggish.
It was impossible to physically remove the chain, and any creature attempting to do so suffered harm. The chain offered slight protection for the target against anything attempting to strike at them but any damage taken by the chain from attacks was also directly transferred to the target.
If the first target of the chain died before the spell expired, the caster could direct the chain at another target for the duration of the spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a length of at least three joined links of chain of fine steel or another pure metal to cast.
