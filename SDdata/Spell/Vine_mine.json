        "mainbody": "Vine mine was a spell used by druids.\nWhen cast, this spell created vines. They grew rapidly and the caster was able to direct them. During casting, the druid was able to choose a specific effect the vines would have on either the caster or an opponent. The caster could use the vines as an aid in climbing, to bind or hamper an opponent, to camouflage so they blended in with the background or to cause the vines to have the same effect as entangle.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a crown made from ivy leaves."
