'''''Combine''''' merged two other currently memorized spells, allowing for their simultaneous casting with merged effects.
 
==Effects==
When the paired spells were actually cast, the most restrictive parameters, such as casting time, range, area of effect, etc., were determined by the spell with the greater restrictions. The linked spells remained intertwined within the caster's mind for a limited time. Failure to cast the combined form resulted in the automatic dissociation of the linked spells, rendering ''combine'' ineffective.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], a pair of rings made from [[gold]].
