        "mainbody": "Control weather was a transmutation or alteration spell that changed the weather in the local area.\nAfter ten minutes of casting, the weather in a two-mile (3.2 km) radius began to change toward the chosen conditions, within the limitations of the season. Older versions of this spell could affect a randomly bigger or smaller area and used the current state of precipitation, temperature, and wind as a baseline, which the caster was able to independently move up or down one level of intensity. The caster could choose the direction of the wind, but not the path of a tornado or the target of lightning. Conditions had to be compatible you could not call for snow and a heat wave, or high winds and fog, for example.\nDruids were exceptionally adept at weather control, able to affect a 50% bigger radius (or double the area), with twice the duration, and, for old-school druids, two levels of intensity change for each of precipitation, temperature, and wind velocity.\nThe post sundering version would last for 8 hours and effect the weather in a 5 mile (8 kilometres) radius, and would change depending on choice, climate and season. The effects would be between 3 types perception changes ranging from \"clear\" to \"torrential rain\", temperature ranging from \"unbearable heat\" to \"arctic cold\", wind changes from \"calm\" to \"storm\".\nThe more recent version of this spell required only verbal and somatic components. Older versions used incense, prayer beads or other divine focus, and the priests holy symbol. The post sundering version needed vocal and somatic components and bits of earth and wood mixed with water and burning incense.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Fourfinger in  and was originally called Fourfingers weather control.\nIn 1370 DR, the city of Mirabar was known to have a permanent control weather effect in its gardens in order to maintain a comfortable year-round temperature for their agriculture."
