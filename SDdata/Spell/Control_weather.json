        "mainbody": "'''''Control weather''''' was a [[transmutation]] or [[alteration]] spell that changed the weather in the local area.",
        "Effects": "After ten minutes of casting, the weather in a two-mile (3.2 km) radius began to change toward the chosen conditions, within the limitations of the season. Older versions of this spell could affect a randomly bigger or smaller area and used the current state of precipitation, temperature, and wind as a baseline, which the caster was able to independently move up or down one level of intensity. The caster could choose the direction of the wind, but not the path of a tornado or the target of lightning. Conditions had to be compatible: you could not call for snow and a heat wave, or high winds and fog, for example.\n\nDruids were exceptionally adept at weather control, able to affect a 50% bigger radius (or double the area), with twice the duration, and, for old-school druids, two levels of intensity change for each of precipitation, temperature, and wind velocity.\n\nThe post sundering version would last for 8 hours and effect the weather in a 5 mile (8 kilometres) radius, and would change depending on choice, climate and season. The effects would be between 3 types: perception changes ranging from \"clear\" to \"torrential rain\", temperature ranging from \"unbearable heat\" to \"arctic cold\", wind changes from \"calm\" to \"storm\".",
        "Components": "The more recent version of this spell required only verbal and somatic components. Older versions used incense, prayer beads or other [[divine focus]], and the priest's [[holy symbol]]. The post sundering version needed vocal and somatic components and bits of earth and wood mixed with water and burning incense.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Fourfinger]] in {{Yearlink|-1997}} and was originally called '''''Fourfinger's weather control'''''.\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], the city of [[Mirabar]] was known to have a permanent ''control weather'' effect in its gardens in order to maintain a comfortable year-round temperature for their agriculture."
