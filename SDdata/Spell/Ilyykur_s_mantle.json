        "mainbody": "Ilyykurs mantle was an arcane abjuration spell that gave the caster some protection against various types of magical attacks.\nThis spell gave the caster a protective aura that covered the body in a soft, form-fitting glow. Ilyykurs mantle was particularly good at protecting the caster from enchantment/charm spells, but also granted a minimal boost to protection from all other types of spells. One additional feature was that all damage from electrical attacks, such as lightning bolt or shocking grasp, was reduced by half.\nIf the caster had a small familiar with which it maintained contact, then the familiar was afforded the same magical protection.\nThe spells duration was a matter of minutes, depending on the power and experience of the caster.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a natural, uncut, unpolished gem of any value.\nThis spell was published in \"Volos Guide to All Things Magical\" and became generally known to the magical community."
