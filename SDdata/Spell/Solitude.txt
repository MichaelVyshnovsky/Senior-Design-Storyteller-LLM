'''''Solitude''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Fenmarel Mestarine]].

==Effects==
This spell was used by casters to create a zone of solitude. While within this zone, which had a radius of {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}, the chances the caster was disturbed by a non-sentient creature was significantly reduced. This zone increased in size as the caster's skill level increased. If the caster left the perimeter, the spell expired. The spell also ended if a sentient creature entered the zone of solitude.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]]: a handful of soil that was sprinkled to mark the perimeter of the spell's area of effect.
