'''''Withering palm''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s and [[wu jen]]. The spell was very rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
This spell acted identically to the ''[[staff of withering]]'' used in [[Faer√ªn]]. Instead of a staff, the wu jen used their hand to transmit the withering effect to a creature. After casting, the wu jen had to come into physical contact with a limb. When touched, the creature's limb aged rapidly, becoming shriveled. The affected limb was rendered useless. Certain spells such as ''[[heal]]'', ''[[limited wish]]'', or ''[[wish]]'' were able to restore the limb to normal.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
