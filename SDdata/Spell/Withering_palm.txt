Withering palm was a common spell used by clerics and wu jen. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
This spell acted identically to the staff of withering used in Faer√ªn. Instead of a staff, the wu jen used their hand to transmit the withering effect to a creature. After casting, the wu jen had to come into physical contact with a limb. When touched, the creatures limb aged rapidly, becoming shriveled. The affected limb was rendered useless. Certain spells such as heal, limited wish, or wish were able to restore the limb to normal.
The spell required verbal and somatic components.
