'''''Hold monster''''' was an [[enchantment]] spell that held a targeted creature helpless.

==Effects==
This spell functioned in the same manner as ''[[hold person]]'', except that it could be used against any creature who failed to resist to its effect.

For as long as the caster concentrated, up to one minute, the spell caused one or more creatures to be paralyzed. While under its effect, a paralyzed creature could repeatedly try to break free from the spell. [[Undead]] creatures were immune to this spell.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]] and material components. The material required was one hard metal bar or rod, which could be as small as a three-penny nail,

==History==
The spell was attributed to the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Prug]] in {{Yearlink|-1864}} and was originally called '''''Prug's hold being'''''.
