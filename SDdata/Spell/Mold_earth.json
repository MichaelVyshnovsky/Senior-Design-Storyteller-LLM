        "mainbody": "'''''Mold earth''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[cantrip]] that could move or temporarily shape a small volume of [[Earth (element)|earth]] or stone.",
        "Effects": "The spell could be used for a variety of functions. It could instantly excavate and harmlessly move aside a volume of earth equivalent to a cube {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} on a side every 6 seconds, out to a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. It was also capable of manipulating earth and stone to form shapes or written messages that lasted for 1 hour. Finally, it could smooth out a rough patch of terrain or cause an otherwise smooth patch to become rough and irregular, also up to 1 hour. Only two of these temporary effects could be active simultaneously, but the caster could choose to end them early.",
        "Components": "The spell required only [[somatic component]]s.",
        "History": "The spell was popular among members of the [[Cult of the Black Earth]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]."
