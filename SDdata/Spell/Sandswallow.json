        "mainbody": "'''''Sandswallow''''' was a powerful spell used by used by [[wizard]]s in [[Anauroch]]. It was extremely rare outside Anauroch.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell caused a circular area of terrain to collapse. The affected area had a radius of 30 feet (9 meters) and creatures within were buried. If a creature was strong enough, they could \"swim\" while the spell was altering the terrain, which prevented the creature from being buried. The spell only functioned if the terrain was a bog, muddy, [[quicksand]], or regular [[sand]].",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell had a [[material component]]."
