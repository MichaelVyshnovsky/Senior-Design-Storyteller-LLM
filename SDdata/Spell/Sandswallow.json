        "mainbody": "Sandswallow was a powerful spell used by used by wizards in Anauroch. It was extremely rare outside Anauroch.\nWhen cast, this spell caused a circular area of terrain to collapse. The affected area had a radius of 30 feet (9 meters) and creatures within were buried. If a creature was strong enough, they could \"swim\" while the spell was altering the terrain, which prevented the creature from being buried. The spell only functioned if the terrain was a bog, muddy, quicksand, or regular sand.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell had a material component."
