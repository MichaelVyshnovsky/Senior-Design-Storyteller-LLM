'''''Deeper darkvision''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that gave the target a special form of [[darkvision]].

==Effects==
On casting ''deeper darkvision'', the creature the caster touched gained a form of special darkvision that allowed the caster to see through darkness, not only mundane darkness, but even those created by [[magic]]al means like ''[[darkness]]'' or ''[[deeper darkness]]''. The eyes of the recipient glowed with a purple glint.

The vision within darkness was only in black and white but very otherwise unproblematic.

==Components==
''Deeper darkness'' required [[somatic]], [[verbal]], and [[material component]]s to cast. The material component was either a pinch of dried [[carrot]] that was thrown at the casting's conclusion or an [[agate]].
