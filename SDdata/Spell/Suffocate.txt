Suffocate was a powerful arcane spell that forced the breath out of all creatures within a  radius.
If a creature failed to resist the effect of the spell, they would literally be suffocated. As they tried to gasp for breath, they took damage, and moved and attacked half as fast as they usually would. In addition, they were far easier to hit, hit less often, and become far less dexterous. The duration of the spell scaled proportional to the casters level. Even after the spell had ended, the recipient still suffered the effects for several seconds after.
The breath extracted from them would be transferred into a small, silken bag. If the bag itself was subject to dispel magic, or opened, the spell itself would fail.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material component was a small, silken pouch studded with black opals of worth at least 5,000 gp.
In 1201 DR, during a great spell battle, Szass Tam used suffocate to kill Nymor Thrul of the Council of Zulkirs.
The spell was used by powerful shairs of Zakhara.
