'''''Water window''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[divine]] spellcasters of the [[Malatran Plateau]] who did not worship gods, instead their magics were granted by the spirits.

==Effects==
When cast upon a body of water within {{SI|10'|'"|long=yes}}, the {{SI|5'|'"|long=yes}} by {{SI|5'|'"|long=yes}} square of water began "replaying" its reflection from the previous 24 hours. The ensorcelled water source showed events and objects as long as the water's reflection captured them in the past. The spell's effectiveness depended on reflected light; if there was no light in the replayed past â€“ the spell produced nothing but darkness. The spellcaster could issue commands to the spell's target, to show a specific object or an event. If the command was impossible, the ''water window'' turned muddy until the spellcaster issued another command to the spell's effects ended after one minute.

The spell could be cast on moving water, but when created, the ''water window'' moved along with the stream or a river.

==Components==
The spell's [[material component]] was the {{SI|5'|'"|long=yes}} by {{SI|5'|'"|long=yes}} square of water that became the ''water window''.
