Water window was a spell used by divine spellcasters of the Malatran Plateau who did not worship gods, instead their magics were granted by the spirits.
When cast upon a body of water within , the  by  square of water began "replaying" its reflection from the previous 24 hours. The ensorcelled water source showed events and objects as long as the waters reflection captured them in the past. The spells effectiveness depended on reflected light if there was no light in the replayed past â€“ the spell produced nothing but darkness. The spellcaster could issue commands to the spells target, to show a specific object or an event. If the command was impossible, the water window turned muddy until the spellcaster issued another command to the spells effects ended after one minute.
The spell could be cast on moving water, but when created, the water window moved along with the stream or a river.
The spells material component was the  by  square of water that became the water window.
