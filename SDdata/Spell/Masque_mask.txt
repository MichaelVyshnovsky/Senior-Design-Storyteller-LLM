'''''Masque mask''''' was a spell used by [[drow]]. It was very rarely used by other races.

==Effects==
A caster used this spell to hide their identities for a short period of time. The spell only function on creatures with a face and did not function on [[undead]] creatures. The spell achieved this by transforming the facial features into a ever-shifting blur. Only the eyes remained unchanged. The spell did not alter hair or skin color, and was rarely able to conceal the race of the caster. Spells that can detect or penetrate illusions such as ''[[true seeing]]'' were able to see through the disguise. 

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
