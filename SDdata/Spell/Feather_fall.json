        "mainbody": "Feather fall (also written as featherfall) was a spell that caused creatures or objects to fall slowly, like a feather.\nAn early form of the spell had a duration and weight limit set by the experience and the power of the caster.\nA later form of feather fall instantly changed the rate at which the target fell to an unnaturally steady rate of ten feet per second. The target of the spell was not damaged upon landing while the spell was in effect. Again the duration of the spell was limited by the experience and power of the caster. However, this spell had no weight limit, instead it was limited by size and number of targets. This spell could be cast in a moment.\nAfter the Spellplague, this spells effects lasted until the target touched the ground again. Feather fall was complex enough that its caster had to wait a day before casting it again.\nBeholders had a permanent feather fall effect. Silver dragons could use a feather fall spell-like ability.\nThe Netherese arcanist Yturn was given for the credit for the creation of this spell in , then known as Yturns feather fall.\nFeather fall was a common spell in the Realms by the midâ€“14th century DR.\nDuring the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, Naneatha Suaril pushed the avatar of Shar off a high balcony of the House of the Moon. However, Shar cast featherfall, causing both of them to land safely. Later that year, the marauding Fellandar hurled the dwarf Onyx the Invincible high into the air. Kyriani caught him with a feather fall spell and brought him safely to earth."
