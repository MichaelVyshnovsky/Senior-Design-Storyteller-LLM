        "mainbody": "'''''Corpse visage''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]] from the schools of [[necromancy]] and [[illusion]] that allowed a [[wizard]] to transform a target's face into that of a rotting corpse.",
        "Powers": "The caster could use this spell on themselves or another target. The illusion created was so profound that it often startled viewers or caused them to flee in terror. The magic of the spell did not favor the caster's allies, making them susceptible to being terrified by the illusion.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a piece of cloth retrieved from a corpse. The cloth needed to be prepared with dots of assorted paint colors before the spell was cast.",
        "History": "This spell was found within the ''[[Book of Shadows]]'', a [[tome]] based upon the oration of the [[necromancer]] [[Nebt Bhakau]] of [[Zakhara]]."
