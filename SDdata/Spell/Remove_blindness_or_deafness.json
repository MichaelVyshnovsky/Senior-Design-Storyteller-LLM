        "mainbody": "'''''Remove blindness or deafness''''' was a [[conjuration]] spell similar to older '''''cure blindness''''' and '''''cure blindness or deafness''''' which were [[abjuration]] spells that could restore sight heal [[deaf]]ness in some cases.",
        "Effects": "There were at least two versions of this spell. The conjuration version was the counterspell to ''[[blindness or deafness]]'' and completely restored sight or hearing lost by most magical or ordinary means. This version could heal damaged organs, but not regenerate missing ones.\n\nThe older, abjuration version of this spell could not repair or regenerate organs damaged by injury or [[disease]], but could restore sight or hearing that was temporarily overwhelmed or lost by the reverse of this spell, ''cause blindness or deafness''.\n\nAnother abjuration spell, called just ''cure blindness'', was also reversible as ''cause blindness'' and was a precursor to the more modern versions. It could not affect the target's hearing.\n\nAll versions of this spell required the caster to successfully touch the target while casting.",
        "Components": "Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were required to cast all versions of this spell. The abjuration versions also required a somatic gesture.",
        "History": "It was recorded in ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy text of the [[church of Mielikki]].<ref>"
