'''''Safe fall''''' was a basic [[alteration]] [[spell]] similar to the ''[[feather fall]]'' spell, but with more versatility. This spell was created by the famed [[wizard]] [[Darsson Spellmaker]].

==Effects==
This spell slowed the falling rate of any solid object or living creatures within its area of effect, which could be as large as 100 square feet. ''Safe fall'' also deflected any missiles passing through the area.

In order for this spell to work, the invisible sheet created needed to be anchored to at least two solid points of contact that were diametrically opposed. Opposite walls usually sufficed for the anchor points.

The ''safe fall'' spell eliminated inertia in either a horizontal or vertical plane. The vertical effect was used to prevent missiles from passing through the invisible barrier.

==Components==
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a single square inch of a closely woven net to cast.
