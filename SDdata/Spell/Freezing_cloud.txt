Freezing cloud was a spell of the evocation school used by wizards early in their studies.
When cast, freezing cloud created a tiny pellet of ice, which shot from the hand of its caster to a spot within fifty feet of him or her. There, the pellet exploded into a cloud of freezing mist over an area of ten feet in radius. Creatures within were subjected to deadly temperatures, depending upon how durable the creature in question was. The cloud dissipated on its own after a moment, but the wizard could, if he or she wished, dismiss it sooner with a little effort.
Freezing cloud required a great deal of concentration on the wizards part and, as such, could only be cast once per day.
