The caster could use the ''wind lash'' to strike out at targets, disrupting any spellcasting from targets and hurling them to the ground. The ''wind lash'' would disappear if the caster begun casting another spell, but the caster was able to use [[magic item]]s in their other hand.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
