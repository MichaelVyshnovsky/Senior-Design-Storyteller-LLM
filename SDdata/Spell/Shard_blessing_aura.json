        "mainbody": "Shard blessing aura was an arcane abjuration spell.\nIt was linked to the goddess Selûne and named for her planetar servants, called the Shards.\nIt was available to sorcerers and wizards of moderate power.\nFor a minute or more, the mage was surrounded by a shimmering light of blue-white hue rather like moonlight. It extended to a diameter of roughly 5 feet (1.5 meters) and went with them if they moved. As well as providing illumination comparable to a candle, it gave the caster all the benefits of a lesser globe of invulnerability.\nMoreover, if the mage was a sorcerer and worshiped Selûne, they also received the effect of a protection from evil.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, its material component was a moonstone or a polished white stone of another kind."
