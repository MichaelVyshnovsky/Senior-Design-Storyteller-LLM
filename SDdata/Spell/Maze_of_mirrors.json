        "mainbody": "Maze of mirrors is a spell of the illusion school learned by some wizards, particularly those interested in illusions as a speciality. When cast, maze of mirrors appears to create a tiny labyrinth of mirrors over an area  in diameter, somewhere within  of the wizard. Any creatures caught within might be fooled by the illusion and left unable to escape until the illusion dissipates a moment later, enough time for a wizard or their allies to take advantage of the situation. The maze of mirrors spell is complex enough that wizards cannot cast it more than once between rests of a few minutes or more in length."
