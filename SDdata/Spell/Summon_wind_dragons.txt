}}'''''Summon wind dragons''''' was a [[spell]] unique to [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This spell created 1-10 small wind vortices called wind dragons. These wind dragons had a {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} diameter and were mentally controlled by the caster. They would disappear if the caster was struck or otherwise distracted from concentrating.

The caster could direct no more than two wind dragons at any one target, but could attack multiple targets at the same time. Wind dragons could not lift targets, but caused buffeting damage and made spellcasting impossible.

This spell could only be cast if air was present. It could not be cast underwater.

==Components==
This spell required a cup as a [[material component]] to cast.
