        "Effects": "This spell created a wall of air that prevented sound from passing through. The wall blocked any sound-based attacks, such as a [[harpy]]'s cry or a [[banshee]]'s wail.",
        "Components": "This spell required a white feather to cast.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some ancient tales in Zakhara spoke of great cities ruled by [[marid]]s that used ''walls against noise'' to protect their citadels against auditory-based magical items, such as ''[[drums of panic]]'' and ''[[horn of blasting|horns of blasting]]''."
