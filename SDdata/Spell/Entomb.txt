}}'''''Entomb''''' was a [[spell]] used commonly in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was only usable by [[wizard]]s.

==Effects==
With this spell the caster trapped creatures within a 30 foot cube of stone raised from the earth. In order for the spell to succeed, the cube needed to be raised from natural earth, passing through any vegetation that was in the area. Any creature caught by this spell was trapped unless they possessed some ability to pass through stone.

''Entomb'' was a popular spell used among [[dao]] slavers.

==Components==
This spell required a small cube of stone scored with lines on each side, as well as verbal components, to cast.
