            "Antipathy": "Affected creatures could not move closer than 60 ft (18.3 m) from the target without becoming terrified of it and feeling an intense urge to move as far as possible from it.",
            "Sympathy": "Affected creatures that saw the target or moved within 60 ft (18.3 m) of it would feel strongly compelled to move towards it.\n\nIn either case, if a creature was able to resist the effect, it immediately realized that it was being magically affected and became immune to it."

        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]] and material components. The materials required depended on the effect desired: for ''antipathy'', a lump of [[alum]] soaked in vinegar; for ''sympathy'', a drop of [[honey]].",
