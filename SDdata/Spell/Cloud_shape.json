        "Effects": "One or more clouds within a {{SIAdj|1000|yard|long=yes}} radius could be manipulated by the caster into limitless number of shapes for an unlimited duration.

The inherent nature of the cloud would be left unaffected.<ref name=ALAY-p24\" />",
        "Components": "In addition to requiring [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s, ''cloud shape'' required a [[material component]], which took the form of the cloud that was to be used by the spell.<ref name=ALAY-p24\" />",
        "History": "In the mid–14{{th}} century DR, Mortimer Lightfoot and a group of other rogue elementalists known as the [[Circle of Four]] used ''cloud shape'', alongside Mortimer's other spell ''[[solid cloud]]'', to create a sort of [[cloud palace]] that they used to imprison their kidnapped victims.<ref name=ALAY-p16\" />"
