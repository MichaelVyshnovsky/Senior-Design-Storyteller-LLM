True prayer of the chosen was a spell that used truespeak to shield one creature with divine insight.
Those protected with the true prayer of the chosen were more difficult to strike or to affect due to a golden coruscation around them, through which a deity gave them divine insight into the dangers they faced.
Besides a holy symbol and a verbal component, the caster needed to speak their own personal true name, a task involving great truespeak skill.
This spell was known to all brimstone speakers.
