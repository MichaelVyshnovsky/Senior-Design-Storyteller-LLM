        "Effects": "On casting ''mage hand'', the caster pointed at an object and move it {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} in any direction. A magical, ghost-like hand was [[conjuration|conjure]]d, which could be used to interact with objects weighing {{SI|10|lb|k|long=yes}} or less. The hand had the equivalent speed of a [[human]] and could easily drop items or, given a moment, pick up new ones. The mage could keep the hand conjured for up to a minute per cast.\n\nWhen cast on [[Avernus]], the first layer of the [[Nine Hells]], the hand looked like a [[fiend]]ish claw.",
        "Components": "Casting ''mage hand'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s.",
        "History": "Before the [[Spellplague]], though ''mage hand'' could only be cast a limited number of times per day during this era, its effects were otherwise similar.",
        "Notable Users": "* [[Arcane trickster]]s: A profession that could only be picked up by people who were capable of casting ''mage hand''."
