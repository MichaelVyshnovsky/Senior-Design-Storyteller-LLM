        "mainbody": "Mage hand was a transmutation cantrip that allowed a caster to manipulate an object some distance away from themself.\nOn casting mage hand, the caster pointed at an object and move it  in any direction. A magical, ghost-like hand was conjured, which could be used to interact with objects weighing  or less. The hand had the equivalent speed of a human and could easily drop items or, given a moment, pick up new ones. The mage could keep the hand conjured for up to a minute per cast.\nWhen cast on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells, the hand looked like a fiendish claw.\nCasting mage hand required somatic and verbal components.\nBefore the Spellplague, though mage hand could only be cast a limited number of times per day during this era, its effects were otherwise similar.\n* Arcane tricksters A profession that could only be picked up by people who were capable of casting mage hand."
