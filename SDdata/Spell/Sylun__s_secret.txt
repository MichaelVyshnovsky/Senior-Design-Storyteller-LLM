Sylunés secret was a wizard spell from the schools of abjuration, alteration, and divination. This spell was created by Syluné Silverhand. This was one of a few of her personal spells that she shared with her sisters.
The caster used this spell on themselves immediately before a confrontation, choosing a specific type of magic the spell would offer protection from—fire, cold, electricity, etc. The spell would also protect from natural forms of the same type, drawing the energy into the caster without harm. Such spells would barely harm anyone standing near the caster before the spell was absorbed. The each spell absorbed in this manner would offer slight healing to the caster as well. There was no limit to the number of specific attacks that could be absorbed while the spell remained active.
The caster could use the stored spell energy to instantly teleport short distances similar to using a dimension door, but without experiencing any delay in performing other actions. The caster was the only one able to use these dimensional doors.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a cat whisker, a shell from a marine creature, and a stone once thrown by the caster to cast.
Laeral Silverhand was researching an improved version of this spell that would allow the caster to transfer the dimensional door abilities to others they touched.
