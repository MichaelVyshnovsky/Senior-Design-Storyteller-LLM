'''''Deflect psionics''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Deep Duerra]].

==Effects==
When cast, this spell deflected [[psionic]] attacks directed towards the caster. However, this spell only protected the caster if another creature was within the spell's area of effect. If that was the case, the psionic attack deflected and struck the other individual instead. The spell could not deflect a psionic attack back to its origin. If no other creature was within the spell's area of effect, the psionic attack struck the caster as intended.

==Components==
In addition to a [[somatic]] component, this spell required a [[material component]], the holy symbol of Deep Duerra.
