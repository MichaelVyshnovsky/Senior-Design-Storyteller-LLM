'''''Elemental weapon''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that infused a temporary [[elemental magic]] effect into a weapon.

==Effect==
The caster would touch the weapon while picking an elemental magical force&mdash;[[acid]], cold, [[fire]], lightning, or thunder&mdash;that would infuse the weapon. The effect lasted for an hour and increased the chance of the weapon hitting its target in addition to causing extra damage with the selected elemental force.

==Components==
Only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components where needed.
