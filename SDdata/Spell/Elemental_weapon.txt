Elemental weapon was a transmutation spell that infused a temporary elemental magic effect into a weapon.
The caster would touch the weapon while picking an elemental magical force&mdashacid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder&mdashthat would infuse the weapon. The effect lasted for an hour and increased the chance of the weapon hitting its target in addition to causing extra damage with the selected elemental force.
Only verbal and somatic components where needed.
