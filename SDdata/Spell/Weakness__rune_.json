        "mainbody": "eakness was a type of giant rune that worsened the physical skills of whoever wielded its inscribed object. It was considered to be the reverse of the strength rune.\nThose who wore the inscribed helmet or girdle would suffer from impaired strength, becoming twice as weak as they were before. However, the victim would also be unaware of this effect and feel no different than usual. The duration of the weakness rune was equal to that of the casters level.\nUpon removal of the runed object the weakness runes effect would instantly cease.\nLike most giant runes, it required no material components to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune healing. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to twelve hours and it needed to be inscribed upon either a helmet or girdle."
