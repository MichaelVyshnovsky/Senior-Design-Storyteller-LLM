        "mainbody": "'''''Weakness''''' was a type of [[giant]] rune that worsened the physical skills of whoever wielded its inscribed object. It was considered to be the reverse of the ''[[strength (rune)|strength]]'' rune.",
        "Effects": "Those who wore the inscribed ''[[helmet]]'' or ''girdle'' would suffer from impaired strength, becoming twice as weak as they were before. However, the victim would also be unaware of this effect and feel no different than usual. The duration of the ''weakness'' rune was equal to that of the caster's level.\n\nUpon removal of the runed object the ''weakness'' rune's effect would instantly cease.",
        "Components": "Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast, though the caster needed to know the giant rune ''[[Healing (rune)|healing]]''. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to twelve hours and it needed to be inscribed upon either a ''helmet'' or ''girdle''."
