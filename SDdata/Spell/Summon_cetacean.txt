'''''Summon cetacean''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Deep Sashelas]].
 
==Effects==
When cast, this spell acted almost identical to ''[[animal summoning I]]''. The key difference was that this spell summoned cetaceans such as [[dolphin]]s, [[Porpoise|porpoises]] and [[whale]]s. The spell has a range of {{SI|1|mi|long=yes}}. The cetacean(s) provided whatever aid they could to the caster. The spell usually summoned dolphins only. The other difference from ''animal summoning I'' is that this spell did not allow the caster to choose which specific cetacean species was summoned, if any were summoned at all.

==Components==
This spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components.
