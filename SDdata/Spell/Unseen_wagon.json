        "Effects": "The spell was akin to ''[[Tenser's floating disk]]'', except it had vertical sides, was waterproof and so could store liquids, and the contents were made invisible.The effect is gleaned and deduced from the title and description; the spell in this article is assumed to be a force-based evocation and illusion.",
