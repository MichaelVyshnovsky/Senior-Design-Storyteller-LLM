It was lost as of the late 14 century DR.\nThe spell was akin to Tensers floating disk, except it had vertical sides, was waterproof and so could store liquids, and the contents were made invisible.The effect is gleaned and deduced from the title and description the spell in this article is assumed to be a force-based evocation and illusion.\nThe spell was developed by Kurtal.
