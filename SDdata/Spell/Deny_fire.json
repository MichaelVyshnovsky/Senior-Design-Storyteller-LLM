        "mainbody": "Deny fire was an abjuration spell that protected the recipient from natural and magical fire.\nWhile deny fire had the same effect as the divine spell resist fire, it actually repelled heat and flames rather than strengthened the body of the spells recipient.\nThe casting of the spell required verbal and somatic components as well as a small piece of hide taken from a red or gold dragon."
