        "mainbody": "Honor mark was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nWizards used this spell to mark targets whom they witnessed performing dishonorable actions. Most honor marks appeared as sharp black marks across the targets eyes or down the middle of their face. Everyone knew an honor mark when they saw one and treated the target accordingly.\nHonor marks could only be removed by atoning for the misdeed that gave them the mark. The wizard who cast the honor mark did not need to do anything for the mark to disappear.\nWizards who attempted to cast this spell falsely, without having witnessed the target performing a dishonorable action, would be marked instead. The mark would remain on the wizard until they apologized to their intended target and performed an task of atonement stated by the offended party.\nThis spell did not require any physical components to cast."
