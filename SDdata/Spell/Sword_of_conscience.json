        "mainbody": "'''''Sword of conscience''''' was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that filled an evil target with pangs of remorse and regret.",
        "Effects": "An evil creature within a short range was instantly \"pierced through the heart\" (metaphorically) with a guilty conscience. The feelings of remorse were so intense that they affected the creature's ability to act wisely or with any charisma, and the strength of this result depended on the extent of the target's evil.",
        "Components": "This spell required [[verbal component]]s and a [[cleric]] or [[paladin]]'s [[holy symbol]] as a [[divine focus]]."
