        "mainbody": "Body outside body was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThe spell created duplicates of the caster. The duplicates appeared within a 10-foot (3-meter) radius from the caster and maintained the ability, equipment and personality of the caster. The spell was unable to duplicate memorized spells or magical items carried by the wu jen. The duplicates obeyed the caster and would co-operate with each other. They suffered damage and vanished when slain. When a duplicate was killed, the caster felt pain and took damage. The duplicates were indistinguishable from the wu jen, and spells such as true seeing would be unable to distinguish a duplicate from the caster. When the spell expired, the duplicates vanished.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component several hairs of the caster."
