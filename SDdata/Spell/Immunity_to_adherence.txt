'''''Immunity to adherence''''' was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] used in the [[Underdark]], which would allow the target to become temporarily immune to both natural and magical web-like materials.This spell did not allow passage through existing magical webs acting as gates, or to free those already stuck in web-like materials. For a spell which allowed for this, see the higher-level ''[[passweb]]'' spell.

==Effects==
The spell would work on any creature that the caster touched, including themselves. Once the spell was cast, the recipient could move through the web-like material, as if there was no material clinging to them at all.

The types of materials affected by the spell were natural and [[magical]] webs, [[mimic]] pseudopods, [[cave fisher]] filaments, [[quicksand]], and viscid globs.

==Components==
As well as [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components, the material components consisted of a windborn seed and a drop of either alcohol, [[water]], tears, or saliva.
