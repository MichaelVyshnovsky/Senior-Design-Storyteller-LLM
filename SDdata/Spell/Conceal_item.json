        "mainbody": "'''''Conceal item''''' was a spell used by [[Church of Lolth|Lolthites]] and [[Church of Vhaeraun|Vhaeraunan priests]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell made it so a targeted item was totally undetectable. The spell also concealed all auras, including alignment and magical auras. If the ''[[true seeing]]'' spell was cast on the item, only a white fog would show. The item in question had to be a non-living object smaller than the caster's total mass. The effect only lasted as long as the caster maintained physical contact with the enchanted item. If the spell was cast on a holy object, the duration of the spell was greatly increased.\n\nThe spell was developed by the [[Church of Lolth]] but is most frequently used by worshipers of [[Vhaeraun]], who used the spell to conceal magical items, holy symbols and weapons.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[Verbal component|verbal]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a small amount of [[gem]] dust. To save on costs, casters frequently ground up cheaper gems such as [[quartz]]."
