Meralds murderous mist was a rare evocation spell that created a cloud of mist that seeped into all openings and then turned poisonous.
Upon casting this spell, a cloud of bluish-gray vapor expanded in all directions from the caster, out to a distance of . This sphere of mist took only a few seconds to form and it permeated all things that were not airtight. Once the vapor cloud reached full size, it turned green and poisonous. The mist burned the flesh and lung tissue of all breathing creatures within the cloud unless they managed to resist the magic of this spell. Its corrosive nature only affected flesh and not clothing or items. The caster was immune to the effects.
Meralds murderous mist lasted for two minutes. Victims that did not leave the area quickly after the cloud turned poisonous were injured further before the mist finally dissipated, although the poison was weaker toward the end of spell. The sphere of vapor was magically held in place and could not be moved by natural or magical winds, but dispel magic or part water spells could remove the mist at any time.
This spell was particularly effective against tiny creatures such as those summoned by creeping doom, insect plague, or insects summoned by summon swarm, killing them instantly. Other means of escape include a portable hole or a rope trick spell.
This spell required verbal, somatic, and material components to cast.
This spell was attributed to the archmage Merald who taught it to his pupil, Sabirine. She recorded it in her book, Sabirines Specular.
