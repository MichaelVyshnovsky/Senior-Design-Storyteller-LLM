A '''hexblade''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spellcaster who combined magical power with martial skill. A hexblade's power could manifest itself spontaneously, similarly to a [[sorcerer]]'s magic,

|Hexblade. What a cool name! So is your sword evil or cursed or something? But you're evil right? ...Okay, now I don't like the name. Names aren't cool if they don't make sense. Like mine. The Xanathar. See? It's cool, and it makes sense!

===Hexblade Patrons===
{{ListPatrons|Hexblade patron}}

==Abilities==
===General Skills===
Hexblade warlocks trained even more thoroughly in the martial arts than other warlocks, mastering use of a broader variety of weapons and the ability to effectively fight in heavier armor. They were also able to closely attune themselves to a weapon; instead of needing great strength or dexterity to effectively wield a weapon it would become an extension of their charismatic will, the same source of strength for their spells, making them exceptionally deadly fighters.

===Hexblade Spells===
If a bargain was made between a warlock and a being from the [[Shadowfell]], the warlock's patron gave them access to certain powers, including a suite of spells that expanded the choices to fill their spell slots.

One of the benefits hexblades received from their patron was access to more spells from which to choose, beginning with the defensive ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]'' and the offensive ''[[wrathful smite]]''. After some advancement, the hexblade could choose to ''[[blur]]'' themselves with shadows or use ''[[branding smite]]'' to reveal an opponent hiding in shadow. Next, a hexblade warlock could use the ''[[blink]]'' spell to confound their enemies or [[elemental weapon|charge their weapon]] with an elemental force for a time. At the next level of advancement they could learn to play mind tricks with ''[[phantasmal killer]]'' or ''[[staggering smite]]''. And finally, when sufficiently advanced, a hexblade could [[banishing smite|infuse a weapon]] with enough power to blast a creature off the [[plane of existence|plane]] for a time or chill them to the bone with ''[[cone of cold]]''.

==Notable Hexblades==
* [[Orielen]], a hexblade involved in the [[Zhentarim]] invasion of [[Shadowdale]] in {{Yearlink|1375}}.
* [[Sithierel]], a [[shadar-kai (fey)|shadar-kai]] hexblade from the [[Shadowfell]].
