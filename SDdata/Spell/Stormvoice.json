        "mainbody": "Stormvoice was a weather spell of the southern magic tradition that allowed the caster to speak with the voice of a storm.\nThe cleric could be heard speaking clearly at up to ten times the normal distance. Unless resisted, any creature within 20 yards (18 meters) of the caster was temporarily deafened and knocked to the ground.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a divine focus."
