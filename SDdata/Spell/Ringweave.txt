'''''Ringweave''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the schools of [[alteration]] and [[evocation]].

==Usage==
With this spell, the caster could duplicate the powers of any [[magic item|magic ring]] they had ever used. The ring in question did not need to be in the caster's possession and they did not need to know how the ring functioned. The number of times the caster could use the duplicated effect depended on their skill level unless the spell expired first. The spell lasted for weeks at a time depending on the caster's skill. When used, the effect would erupt from any item that the caster choose when casting the spell. The spell would end if this item was destroyed.

A successful ''[[dispel magic]]'' on the item only prevented the item from functioning for several minutes depending on the skill of the dispelling caster. The caster of ''ringweave'' need not have the item on their person, so could effectively use the item's power if it was carefully hidden nearby in order to protect it from discovery.

==Components==
This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.
