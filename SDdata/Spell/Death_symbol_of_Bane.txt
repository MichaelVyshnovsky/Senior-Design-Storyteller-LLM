Death symbol of Bane was a powerful divine conjuration spell used by specialty priests devoted to Bane, enabling them to create a potent and long-lasting symbol.
The death symbol was created with the direct assistance of Bane long ago and used by the Risen Cult of Bane.
This symbol discharged once for every different creatures blood used during the casting, usually involving at least thirty different creatures. Their blood was mixed into a paste with black opal dust, and diamond dust. Each kind of dust had a value of at least 5,000 gp.
The death symbol vanished when cast and glowed when discharged. Any creature wearing Banes holy symbol would not active the death symbol. Usually used on doorways and portals, the symbol would activate when crossed by a creature whose blood matched one of the types used to make the paste when the spell was first cast.
When discharged, the symbol released a blast of fatal life-draining energy, affecting anything found within . Creatures within  experienced a harmful withering sensation that stood a chance to permanently drain a portion of their health away. Anyone within  felt debilitating wracking pains that lasted for 2â€“20 minutes. All of these effects were cumulative based on the creatures proximity to the death symbol.
The death symbol would explode if the surface upon which it was cast was destroyed, harming anyone within .
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the special paste to cast. The paste was used to draw the symbol.
