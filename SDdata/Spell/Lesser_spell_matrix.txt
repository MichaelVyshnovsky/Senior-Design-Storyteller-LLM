'''''Lesser spell matrix''''' was a powerful spell that created a magic matrix.
==Effects==
When cast, the spell created a magic matrix that allowed the caster to store another spell, up to a third-level spell, for later use. Once placed, the stored spell was cast as a prepared spell. Once a spell was cast from the matrix, it was no longer stored. ''[[Dispel magic]]'' could break the magic matrix and removed any spell stored within. If the matrix enters an ''[[antimagic field]]'', it was temporarily interupted until the caster emerged from the area of effect. If a caster was slain while the matrix was active, it collapsed and the stored spell was harmlessly dispelled.
==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a [[Spell focus|focus]], a chunk of [[amber]] with a value of at least 500 [[gp]].
