        "mainbody": "'''''Magic circle against good''''', also known as '''''protection from good, 10' radius''''', was an [[abjuration]] spell that created a sphere of warding against mental and physical attacks from good creatures. The older version of this spell was reversible, called '''''[[protection from evil, 10' radius]]''''', and had identical effects on evil creatures.",
        "Effects": "This spell operated just like ''[[magic circle against evil]]'' except that it extended the area of effect for ''[[protection from good]]'' rather than ''[[protection from evil]]'', and it could trap a nonevil summoned creature.",
        "Components": "See the description of the components at ''[[magic circle against evil]]''.",
        "History": "The [[Arcane magic|arcane version]] of ''protection from good, 10' radius'' was developed by [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[M'dhal]] in  [[-1040 DR|2819 NY (âˆ’1040 DR)]]. The non-reversed form was known as ''M'dahl's dispel evil II'' at that time."
