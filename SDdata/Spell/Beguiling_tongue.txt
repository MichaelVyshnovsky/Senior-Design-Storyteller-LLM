Beguiling tongue, sometimes called beguiling influence, was a spell used by warlocks to enhance their own charm and capacity for persuasion by making the very voice of a warlock powerful with great magic. Beguiling tongue was particularly attractive to those who specialized in pacts with powerful archfey, since its power drew heavily on the magical energies of the Feywild.
Beguiling tongue was relatively easy to cast and though a warlock could only use it intermittently, a short rest of a few minutes was enough to regain its power.
