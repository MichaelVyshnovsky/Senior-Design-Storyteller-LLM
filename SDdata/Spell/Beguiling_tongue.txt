'''''Beguiling tongue''''', sometimes called ''beguiling influence'', was a [[spell]] used by [[warlock]]s to enhance their own charm and capacity for persuasion by making the very voice of a warlock powerful with great [[magic]]. ''Beguiling tongue'' was particularly attractive to those who specialized in [[Warlock#Fey Pact Warlock|pacts with powerful archfey]], since its power drew heavily on the magical energies of the [[Feywild]].

''Beguiling tongue'' was relatively easy to cast and though a warlock could only use it intermittently, a short rest of a few minutes was enough to regain its power.
