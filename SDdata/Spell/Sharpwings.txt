Sharpwings was a spell used by dragons.
When cast, the spell modified the wings of the dragon, transforming the leading edge of each wing into a razor-sharp blade with the strength of steel. Although the blade edge could not be visually observed, anyone who touched the foremost ridge of the affected dragons wing perceived the lethal nature of this magical enchantment.
This spell only required a verbal component.
The shadow dragon Aurgloroasa was known to use sharpwings.
