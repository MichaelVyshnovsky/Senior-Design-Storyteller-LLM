        "mainbody": "'''''Heat leech''''' was a [[necromantic]] [[divine magic]] spell available to [[cleric]]s of [[Auril]], the Frostmaiden. It drained vitality from all creatures in a small area and transferred that vitality to the caster, even to the point of gaining temporary health beyond normal limits.",
        "Effects": "This spell could be cast at a creature or group of creatures up to 45 ft (14 m) away (higher level casters could extend this range). It affected all creatures except the caster that fit within a 30 ft (9.1 m) diameter circle<ref group=\"note\">It doesn't have to be a circle, but a circle gives the maximum possible area. It could be an equilateral triangle with 30 ft sides, or a square with 30 ft diagonals, for example. or other regular shape as long as no two individuals were more than 30 ft (9.1 m) apart. Each creature had a chance to resist the magic of this spell, and if they had sufficient fortitude, no harm was done to them. Those that failed to resist were subjected to extreme cold that sucked the life force from their bodies, possibly causing unconsciousness or death.\n\nThe sum of all life force stolen by ''heat leech'' was transferred to the caster as health, first healing any wounds he or she may have sustained. Any surplus vitality granted the caster a temporary health boost beyond the normal limit that acted like a damage shield. This shield lasted for 15 minutes (longer for more experienced casters) or until it absorbed an equivalent amount of damage, whichever came first.\n\nThis spell had no effect on the [[undead]].",
        "Components": "This spell required verbal and somatic components as well as the use of the caster's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]].",
        "History": "This spell was believed to be recorded in a holy book of Auril called ''[[Revelations of the Icedawn]]'' and was only granted to her clerical followers.{{Cite dragon/312/Faiths of Faerun: Prayers of the Frostmaiden|62}}"
