        "mainbody": "Mask of Gargauth was a divine alteration and enchantment spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Gargauth called Malefactors.\nThis spell allowed the malefactor to alter the appearance of themselves and their equipment to resembled any man-sized human, humanoid, or similar creature. The sizes could be changed larger or smaller by 50%. This spell even allowed flight if wings were added, but at one third of the normal rate. Any special abilities or weaknesses from the new form were not passed on to the caster. Changing back to the original form would end the spell early.\nThis spell lasted for many days, but the casters appearance became more diabolical with each day that passed without the spell being recast, resulting in a permanent scar on the casters charisma.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components an unblessed broken horn manifested by Gargauth and the priests holy symbol to cast."
