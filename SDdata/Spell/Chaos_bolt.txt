'''''Chaos bolt''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s, most often [[Sorcerer#Chaos Sorcerer|chaos sorcerers]], that shot a blast of chaotic, multicolored light that dealt damage of an unpredictable type to its target.

==Effects==
Before the [[Second Sundering]], the spell worked by shooting out from the sorcerer's hand towards the head of an enemy within {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}}, filling the target's mind with wracking pain in a telepathic attack. Enhanced and fueled by a sorcerer's charisma like virtually all sorcerer spells, ''chaos bolt'' grew in potency as the sorcerer casting it grew more powerful. Regardless of its exact effects, this version of ''chaos bolt'' was instantly recastable.

The post-Second Sundering version had an increased range of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} and dealt damage of an unpredictable type, which could be [[acid]], cold, [[fire]], force, lightning, [[poison]], psychic, or thunder.

Both versions of the bolt, powered by the [[wild magic]] of sorcerers, had unpredictable effects. It could simply injure the intended target or it could lash out and strike another target within {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} to {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} of the first. If this happened, it was possible that it would strike yet another target within the same range.

==Components==
The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
