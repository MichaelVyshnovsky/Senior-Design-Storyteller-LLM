        "mainbody": "Moon lust was an enchantment spell used by Silverhair Knights, an order devoted to Eilistraee.\nWhen cast, the spell conjured a compelling enchantment that induced an intense, obsessive fascination with the moon in a target creature. The targeted creature became wholly captivated by the moon, entering a state of fascination. This state persisted for the spells entire duration. In instances where the moon was obscured or not visible at the time of casting, the spells effect shifted from fascination to a state of worry and distraction.\nCreatures devoid of sight were immune to the effects of this spell, as the basis of the enchantment relied on the targets ability to perceive the moon.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a focus an ingot of silver with a value of 5 gp."
