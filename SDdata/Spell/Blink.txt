'''''Blink''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] caused the caster to "blink" randomly between the [[Prime Material Plane]] and the [[Ethereal Plane]], similar to a [[blink dog]].

==Effect==
This made the caster harder to attack, since there was a chance an attack or spell would miss due to the caster not being on the Prime Material Plane at the time.

The caster could attempt to move through solid objects on the Prime Material Plane while blinked onto the Ethereal Plane, however, if the caster materialized in the same location as a solid object, he or she became "shunted" to the nearest available empty space, and this caused damage.

The later post-[[Second Sundering|Sundering]] version of the spell worked much in the same way but it allowed movement of only 10 feet. The caster could see and hear into the prime to a distance of only 60 feet but in shades of gray. While on the ethereal plane, the caster could not interact with creatures on the prime, only with those that connected to the ethereal plane. If no unoccupied space was found within 10 feet when the caster had to return, they would be randomly be placed in the nearest unoccupied area.

==Components==
Only verbal and somatic components were needed for the casting.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Oberon (Netherese arcanist)|Oberon]] in {{Yearlink|-967}} and was originally called '''''Oberon's blinking'''''.

==Notable Uses==
During the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], [[Luna]] confronted the [[Shar|false avatar]] of [[Sel√ªne]], but she cast ''sink'' and caused her to fall into the ground. Luna used a ''blink'' spell to escape.{{Cite comic/Selune Rising|20}}

==Notable Users==
The [[fang dragon]] [[Nartheling]], the "Master of the Mountain", could cast ''blink''.
