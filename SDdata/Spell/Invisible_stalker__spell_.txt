Invisible stalker, originally called Carburys stalker,
The summoned invisible stalker would obey the caster through any means possible, until the task was accomplished. As they were excellent trackers, they could find out where any targets had gone. As they were not loyal to their conjurer masters, they would often dally in their tasks, especially if they took place over a long distance or period of time.
They could take orders via Common only, unless their masters spoke Auran, in which the stalkers could respond.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material component was a crescent-shaped horn and some burning incense.
The spell was invented by Netherese arcanist Carbury in , and was first known as Carburys stalker.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast invisible stalker within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.
