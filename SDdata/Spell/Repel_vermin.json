        "mainbody": "'''''Repel vermin''''', and another version called '''''repel insects''''', were [[abjuration]] spells that created an invisible barrier to keep out unwanted pests.",
        "Effects": "The area of effect for these spells was a 10 ft (3 m) radius around the spellcaster. The older version of this spell was only effective against normal- and giant-sized true insects, not arachnids like spiders and scorpions. The newer version worked on all manner of [[vermin]]. These spells were proof against all normal pests and some giant versions, but large, determined creatures could breach the barrier, taking damage as they crossed into the protected area.",
        "Components": "The newer version of this spell required verbal and somatic components as well as the caster's [[divine focus]] or [[holy symbol]]. The older version required one of the following: crushed [[marigold]] flowers, a crushed [[leek]], crushed [[stinging nettle]] leaves, or a small blob of [[camphor tree]] resin."
