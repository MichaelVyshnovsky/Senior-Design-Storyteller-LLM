        "mainbody": "Repel vermin, and another version called repel insects, were abjuration spells that created an invisible barrier to keep out unwanted pests.\nThe area of effect for these spells was a 10 ft (3 m) radius around the spellcaster. The older version of this spell was only effective against normal- and giant-sized true insects, not arachnids like spiders and scorpions. The newer version worked on all manner of vermin. These spells were proof against all normal pests and some giant versions, but large, determined creatures could breach the barrier, taking damage as they crossed into the protected area.\nThe newer version of this spell required verbal and somatic components as well as the casters divine focus or holy symbol. The older version required one of the following crushed marigold flowers, a crushed leek, crushed stinging nettle leaves, or a small blob of camphor tree resin."
