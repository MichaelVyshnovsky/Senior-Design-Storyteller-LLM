'''''Hurl rock''''' was a [[divine]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[cleric]] to launch a single stone in the air towards a desired target. The reverse of this spell, '''''rock shield''''', allowed the caster to deflect any stones or that were launched in their direction.

==Effects==
When cast, ''hurl rock'' allowed the caster to use a form of ''[[telekinesis]]'' to launch a stone towards a target creature, item or location. Any loose rock, boulder or even part of a rock face was suitable so long as it was under a certain size. This size, along with the distance the projectile could travel, was dependent on the skill and power of the caster. The hurled stone could be destroyed in flight, after impact, and had a chance of releasing rocky shrapnel that damaged anyone nearby.

''Rock shield'' created a [[magic]]al barrier around the caster that deflected any rocky projectiles launched at them. It remained in effect for a matter of seconds, depending on the skill and power of the caster.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components, the ''hurl rock'' spell required a single pebble and the desired rocky projectile. The [[material component]]s for ''rock shield'' were two spell pebbles and a piece of semi-transparent material such as glass, ice, or even a small [[gem]].

==Usage==
High-ranking dwarven [[priest]]s of [[Haela Brightaxe]] were typically known to have this spell bestowed upon them.
