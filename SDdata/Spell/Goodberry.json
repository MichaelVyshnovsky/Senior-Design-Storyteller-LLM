        "mainbody": "'''''Goodberry''''' was a [[transmutation]] or [[alteration]]/[[evocation]] spell that turned a few berries into a magical food that could ''[[cure minor wounds]]'' and/or provide a healthy creature with the equivalent of a full meal. The reverse of this spell, '''''badberry''''', created a poisonous food that had the same effect as ''[[inflict minor wounds]]''.",
        "Description": "Goodberries were full, fleshy fruit that exuded a subtle, appeasing scent.",
        "Effects": "The caster passed his or her [[holy symbol]] over a handful of freshly picked, edible berries, spoke the incantation, and a few of the berries became a magical food. The caster and anyone else of the religion or profession able to cast this spell could easily determine which berries were magical, everyone else had to use ''[[detect magic]]'' or trial and error. The alteration/evocation version of this spell created berries that did one of two things: one berry either healed the equivalent of a ''[[cure minor wounds]]'', or, if the consumer was in good health, provided a medium-sized creature with the nourishment of a full meal. The berries created by the transmutation version of this spell did both. Eating more than eight ''goodberries'' in a 24-hour period provided no additional benefit.\n\nIf cast in reverse, ''badberry'' took rotten berries and made them look fresh and tasty, but if ingested they each ''[[inflict minor wounds|inflicted minor wounds]]'' by poison, disregarding any chance to resist the poison.",
        "Components": "Verbal and somatic components, as well as the caster's [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]] and a handful of freshly picked edible berries were required to cast this spell.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was reported by [[Lyra Sunrose]] that casting ''badberry'' on beetle palm nuts always failed and spoiled the nuts. Followers of nature [[deities]] frowned upon anyone who did not attempt to plant the black kernel of an enchanted beetle palm nut after consuming the protective rind for its magical benefits."
