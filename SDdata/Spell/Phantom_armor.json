        "mainbody": "'''''Phantom armor''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[illusion]] and [[alteration]] [[spell]] that created a suit of [[plate mail]].",
        "Effects": "This spell protected the subject by covering them with a quasi-real suit of plate mail. The spell would not work if anyone viewing the target did not believe the illusion. The ''phantom armor'' could be dispelled via a ''[[dispel illusion]]'' or ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell or by a ''[[wand of negation]]''. Furthermore, this spell would not function if combined with any other form of protective magic.\n\nIn addition to providing the physical protection of a real suit of plate mail, ''phantom armor'' would absorb physical energy from incoming attacks that scaled with the caster's skill. The armor would vanish when it absorbed enough energy to reach its threshold. Since it was not a real suit of [[armor]], ''phantom armor'' did not hinder the target's movement or spellcasting ability.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a small plate of [[mithril]] worth at least 10 [[gp]] to cast. The plate disappeared when the spell was cast.",
        "History": "This spell was used by [[Durissa Thornion]], an [[illusionist]] from [[Chondath]]."
