        "mainbody": "Phantom armor was an arcane illusion and alteration spell that created a suit of plate mail.\nThis spell protected the subject by covering them with a quasi-real suit of plate mail. The spell would not work if anyone viewing the target did not believe the illusion. The phantom armor could be dispelled via a dispel illusion or dispel magic spell or by a wand of negation. Furthermore, this spell would not function if combined with any other form of protective magic.\nIn addition to providing the physical protection of a real suit of plate mail, phantom armor would absorb physical energy from incoming attacks that scaled with the casters skill. The armor would vanish when it absorbed enough energy to reach its threshold. Since it was not a real suit of armor, phantom armor did not hinder the targets movement or spellcasting ability.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a small plate of mithril worth at least 10 gp to cast. The plate disappeared when the spell was cast.\nThis spell was used by Durissa Thornion, an illusionist from Chondath."
