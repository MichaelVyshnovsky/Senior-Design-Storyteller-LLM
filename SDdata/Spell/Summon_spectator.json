        "mainbody": "'''''Summon spectator''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Helm]], enabling them to create the ultimate guardian.",
        "Effects": "This spell summoned the ''[[spectator]]''â€“a large orb with a central unblinking eye and four eyestalks to monitor each direction. The ''spectator'' was corrupted by evil forces during ages past, leading to the formation of the [[beholder]] race.\n\nOnce summoned, a ''spectator'' would serve a single task involving guarding for 101 years. The ''spectator'' would only allow its summoner or another priest of Helm to enter the area it was guarding. Its impressive telepathic abilities allowed the ''spectator'' to see through false claims quickly.\n\nThe ''spectator'' would remain at its post unless slain or blinded in all five eyes. If blinded, the ''spectator'' would return to [[Mechanus]] to regenerate for a full day before returning to its post. However, upon its return if the ''spectator'' realized its post had been breached, it would then return permanently to Mechanus.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]] and a [[steel]] [[gauntlet]] blessed by Helm to cast. The gauntlet was consumed during the casting.",
        "History": "In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, [[Chief Prelate]] [[Relarn Dayspring|Dayspring]] of the [[Clerical Circle]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] declared it illegal for priests to cast ''summon spectator'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]], threatening arrest for those that broke this decree.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}"
