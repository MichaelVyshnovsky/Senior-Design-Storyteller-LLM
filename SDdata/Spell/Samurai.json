        "mainbody": "Samurai were professional warriors of the noble class who adhered to the code of bushido.\nSamurai were fierce warriors bound by a strict code of honor, and service to their daimyo. They did not fear death, as samurai saw death to be the ultimate honor and service to their daimyo. A samurais life was consumed by striving to achieve perfection, as it was a reflection of their honor. \nMost samurai were human or spirit folk. Some korobokuru have successfully trained to become samurai.\nThe samurais weapon of choice was the katana. Samurai formed a deep bond with their katana, who saw it as an extension of their honor and the honor of their clan or family. The katana was often a family heirloom, passed down through the generations. It was a serious insult to just touch the scabbard of a samurais katana without their explicit permission, drawing the blade even more so. A samurai who lost their katana was disgraced and shamed, and became obsessed with recovering the weapon, if possible.\nSamurai were part of their daimyos household. The first part of samurai training was learning to connect and focus their ki.\nJito\nA samurai who was advanced in skill and also served their daimyo well were offered the position of jito. As jito, the samurai was given responsibility over a part of their daimyos territory. A jito protected their daimyos property, settled disputes among the civilians, suppressed rebellion and collected taxes on behalf of their daimyo, keeping one-quarter of the taxes for themselves. A jito had command over four samurai and up to ten bushi.\nShugo\nA jito who served well was offered the position of shugo. A shugo was in charge of an entire province, administering justice, providing protection and supervising the jito within the province.\nRonin\nA ronin was a master-less samurai. A ronin could be a samurai who has dishonored them-self, failed their daimyo, or voluntarily left the service of their daimyo.\nSamurai were highly skilled martial warriors. They were experts at both archery and swordsmanship. Their weapons of choice in melee combat were the katana and wakizashi, and they chose the daikyu for ranged combat.  Some samurai, particularly female samurai, favored the naginata. A samurai was also an expert horse-rider. \nIn addition to their martial prowess, samurai were skilled artists. Calligraphy, music, poetry and painting were among the most common art forms that samurai were known to be accomplished in.\nSamurai eventually became immune to fear and advanced samurai were capable of naturally projecting an aura of fear. The strongest samurai were able to project ki into their voice, creating a deafening and powerful shout which stunned a target."
