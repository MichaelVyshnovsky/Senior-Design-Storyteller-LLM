        "mainbody": "'''''Shadowshield''''' was an [[alteration]] [[spell]] that imbued a creature or person with a phantom composed of pure [[shadow]].",
        "Effects": "The phantom remained with the affected being and was capable of absorbing damage they received when attacked by physical means. Every time a target being was struck, 60% of any harm that would have befallen them, was transferred to the phantom. It remained until it received sufficient damage, after which it would simply dissipate.\n\nThe protective effects of the phantom did not apply to any damage received from ''[[psionic]]'' or [[magic]]al sources, such as spells or spell-like abilities.\n\n''Shadowshield'' could not be cast on the subject again for a matter of days, depending on their overall health and fortitude. If the spell was cast upon them more than three times in one year, it could possibly drain them of their life essence.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required the use of the subject's natural shadow, which must have been present at the time of casting."
