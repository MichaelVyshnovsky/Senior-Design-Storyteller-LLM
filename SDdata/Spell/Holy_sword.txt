'''''Holy sword''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[paladin]]s.

==Effects==
This spell gave the caster the ability to channel the power of their [[deity]] into a melee weapon, usually a sword. The weapon became temporarily enchanted and emitted an effect, ''[[magic circle against evil]]''. If the spell was cast on a weapon that was already enchanted, this spell overrode the weapon's enchantments. The weapon was enchanted until the spell expired or the caster dropped it. A caster could not wield two ''holy sword'' spells at a time. This spell could not be combined with spells such as ''[[bless weapon]]'', and could not be cast onto an artifact.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
