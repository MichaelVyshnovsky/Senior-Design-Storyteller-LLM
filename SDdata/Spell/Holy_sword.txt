Holy sword was a spell used by paladins.
This spell gave the caster the ability to channel the power of their deity into a melee weapon, usually a sword. The weapon became temporarily enchanted and emitted an effect, magic circle against evil. If the spell was cast on a weapon that was already enchanted, this spell overrode the weapons enchantments. The weapon was enchanted until the spell expired or the caster dropped it. A caster could not wield two holy sword spells at a time. This spell could not be combined with spells such as bless weapon, and could not be cast onto an artifact.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
