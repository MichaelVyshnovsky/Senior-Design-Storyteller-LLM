'''''Ghost sound''''', also known as '''''audible glamer''''', was a [[cantrip]] of [[arcane]] [[magic]] of the [[illusion]] [[school]] that allowed the caster to create an illusory sound.

==Description==
''Ghost sound'' created a chosen sound within a short distance from the caster. After the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, this began at {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}}, or further for more experienced casters. ''Ghost sound'' grew in potency with the experience and power of its caster, growing louder as the caster grew more powerful. After the [[Spellplague]], however, it was fixed at {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}}.

The sound could be of anything, as selected by the caster at the time of casting but it could not be changed afterward. It could replicate the sound of up to four [[human]]s conversing, singing, shouting, walking, running, or marching, growing to twenty humans for the greatest casters. Other creatures were defined according to this hypothetical volume: a swarm of [[rat]]s scampering and squeaking was considered equivalent to eight humans; one roaring [[lion]] to sixteen humans, and one roaring [[dire tiger]] to twenty humans. Other examples included a quiet, whispery sound; the clash of battle with a ringing [[sword]]; clinking [[armor]]; or a scraping against stone. A caster could even use it to whisper a message to a listener some distance away. Moreover, the sound could increase or decrease in volume, appear to move closer or further away from a listener, or stay fixed.

''Ghost sound'' paired well with other illusions, such as enhancing the realism of an otherwise ''[[silent image]]''.

''[[Permanency]]'' was applicable to ''ghost sound''.

==Components==
''Ghost sound'' required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, as well as a small piece of [[wool]] or lump of [[wax]] as a [[material component]]. Casting was completed with a wink.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Xanad]] in {{Yearlink|-944}} and was originally called ''Xanad's glamer''.
