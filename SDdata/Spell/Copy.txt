Copy was an arcane evocation spell that allowed the caster to make a perfect copy of a letter, map, or other such document.
The magic of the spell activated when the caster held a blank piece of parchment over the document to be copied. Each casting of this spell could copy up to ten standard size pages. Copy could not be used on magical writings of any kind.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a blank piece of parchment paper and a drop of ink to cast.
The copy spell was allowed to be used within the Great Library of the House of the Moon in Waterdeep.
