Owls wisdom was a transmutation spell that temporarily boosted a creatures insight.
The caster had to touch the recipient of this spell. When cast, the target creatures wisdom was greatly enhanced for a time that increased with the casters skill.
This spell had verbal, somatic, and material components in the form of owl feathers or droppings. When the spell was cast as divine magic, the caster needed a divine focus instead of the aforementioned material component.
