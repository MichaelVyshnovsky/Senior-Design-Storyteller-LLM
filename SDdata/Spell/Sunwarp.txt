Sunwarp was a spell used by spellcasters from Zakhara, the Land of Fate and the Bedine of Anauroch.
This was an impressive illusion spell that multiplied an image selected by the caster and filled an area with it. The caster could make one camel appear to be a herd, or one soldier appear as a band of mercenaries, etc.
The caster viewed the selected object through a quartz crystal and focused on one item on the object that the caster has touched. When this focal point moved, the rest of the illusion moved with it.
The illusion appeared to waver from the rising air heated by the sun.
This spell required a small quartz crystal to cast.
