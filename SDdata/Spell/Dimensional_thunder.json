        "mainbody": "'''''Dimensional thunder''''' was a [[teleportation]] [[spell]] used by [[swordmage]]s, most often those of the raging storm path, who preferred to use the forces of thunder and lightning together. With ''dimensional thunder'' a swordmage could cut a hole in the fabric of the [[Prime Material Plane|Prime]], slipping through into to another location, how far away depending on the swordmage's constitution. In the process, the swordmage brought with him or her a wake of thunderous sound, which could be deadly to nearby enemies and which boomed outward from the swordmage's weapon. The sound echoed for some time afterward, causing continuous pain to a swordmage's adversaries. It was not an easy spell to cast, however, and could only be used once per day.{{Cite dragon/367/Class Acts: Primordial Paths}}",
