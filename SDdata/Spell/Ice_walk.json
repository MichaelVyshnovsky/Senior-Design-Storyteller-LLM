        "mainbody": "Ice walk was a divine alteration spell used by specialty priests devoted to Ulutiu, enabling them to allow targets to safely walk on ice.\nThis spell allowed the targets to safely walk upon ice of any thickness as if it were firm ground. The targets feet did not actually touch the ice, nor did their passing leave a trace.\nIn addition to verbal components and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and some snow or a piece of ice to cast."
