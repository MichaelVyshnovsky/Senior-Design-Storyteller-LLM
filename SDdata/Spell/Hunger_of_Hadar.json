        "mainbody": "'''''Hunger of Hadar''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] for [[warlock]]s that used the power of [[Hadar]], the Dark Hunger,",
        "Effect": "The spell caused a 20-foot (6-meter) radius spherical gateway of utter darkness to appear and stay open for one minute, or for as long as the caster concentrated. The beings beyond this rift emanated dark incomprehensible whispers and slurping noises that could be heard on the caster's side. Whoever stood within this region of warped space would suffer damage from the cold of space, as well as from attacks by [[acid]]ic tentacles from the unknown horrors beyond,",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]] and material components. The material needed was a pickled [[octopus]] tentacle."
