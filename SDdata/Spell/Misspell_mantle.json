        "mainbody": "Misspell mantle was a spell that was first developed by the phaerimms.\nWhen cast, this spell enshrouded a target creature with an invisible aura. The targeted creature had no sensation of this aura and was unaware they were the target of a spell. Another creature was able to detect the spell as the targeted creature emitted a strong magical presence. While the spell was in effect, if the targeted creature cast their own spell, the results of the spell varied randomly from its intended result. The spell was vulnerable to dispel magic.\nThis spell required only a verbal component.\nThis spell was originally created by the phaerimm of Myth Drannor."
