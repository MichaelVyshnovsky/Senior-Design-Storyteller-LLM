Tortoise shell was an abjuration spell used by druids.
This spell created a large protective turtle shell measuring  in diameter. The shell was quite durable and could even float if turned upside down. The shell could be moved about by the caster as if it only weighed a few pounds, but it was much heavier if anyone else tried to move it. The shell would remain perfectly balanced if set perpendicular to the ground.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a whole turtle shell to cast.
