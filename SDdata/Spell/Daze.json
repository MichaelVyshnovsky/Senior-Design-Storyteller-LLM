        "mainbody": "'''''Daze''''' was a simple [[cantrip]] that temporarily clouded the mind of a targeted [[humanoid]] creature. It was considered an [[enchantment]] of the compulsion sub-school of magic.\n\nAn [[eyeball]], a minuscule relative of the [[beholder]] could daze opponents with one of its four tiny eyestalks.",
        "Effects": "The spell could affect a single humanoid within a close range. An effected humanoid was not stunned and could still move about but remained in a daze for about six seconds. Powerful or strong-minded humanoids were not affected by this spell.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required a pinch of wool or another similar material, which was consumed during casting, and the use of [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
