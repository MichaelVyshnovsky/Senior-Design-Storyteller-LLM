Javelin was an uncommon evocation spell of the southern magic tradition. 
When cast, the spell caused a javelin to become filled with energy. When thrown, the javelin struck a target without error within the spells range, which was 80 yard (73 meter). 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, an ordinary javelin.
