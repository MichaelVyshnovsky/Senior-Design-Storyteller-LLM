        "mainbody": "'''''Awakening''''' was an [[enchantment]]/[[invocation]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to activate an item with multiple [[magic]]al enchantments, or dweomers.",
        "Effects": "This spell could be used in the process of creating a [[item enchantment|magical item]], or attaching additional enchantments to one created with the spell ''[[enchant an item]]''. In the case of the former, items had to be prepared with ''[[eternal flame]]'' and either ''[[wondrous web]]'' or ''[[holy vesting]]''. If additional spells, such as ''[[Merald's meld]]'', ''[[crown meld]]'', ''[[Veladar's vambrace]]'', ''[[Nulathoe's ninemen]]'', or ''[[holy might]]'' were cast on the item prior to its ''awakening'', the success rate would increase cumulatively.\n\nFailure of this spell would cause this item to crumble to dust or explode in a ''[[fireball]]''. Success would render it ready for use and cause it to shine with a bright magical light.",
        "Components": "The [[material component]]s for this spell were an inscribed [[arcane]] scroll, a valuable [[gem]], and a living plant that had been somehow altered by magic. The number of spells that were required to be inscribed on the scroll, as well as the value of the gem were both dependent on the number of enchantments on the item being created."
