'''''Scouring wind''''' was an [[alteration]]/[[evocation]] [[spell]] that strong current of air that emanated from out of the caster's mouth.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, a cylindrical gust of wind shot out from the caster for a length of up to 900' (0.3 km). It functioned similar to a ''[[gust of wind]]'', blowing away any vapors, dusts or lighter, non-living objects. It had no effect on living persons or creatures.

Depending on what the casting [[cleric]] chose, a ''scouring wind'' could be used in a number of ways. Depending on the specifications, it could be used to destroy [[magic]]al barriers (such as an ''[[antimagic shell]]'' or ''[[prismatic sphere]]''), temporarily removed the [[Item enchantment|magical enchantment]] of a [[shield]] or suit of [[armor]], destroy mundane missiles and projectiles, negate any naturally-occurring or magically-created air flows.

==History==
The specifications of this spell could be found inscribed upon the [[Talassan]] [[relic]], the ''[[Chanting Chain]]''.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast.
