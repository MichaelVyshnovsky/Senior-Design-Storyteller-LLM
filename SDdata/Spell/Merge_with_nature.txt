'''''Merge with nature''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[necromancy]] [[spell]] used by priestesses devoted to [[Sune]], enabling them to avoid old age by becoming a [[dryad]].

==Effects==
Priestesses of Sune used this spell to avoid the effects of old age and even death by permanently transforming into a dryad. Only higher-ranking and particularly desperate priestesses used this spell. This spell fell out of favor with the [[Church of Sune]] but was retained by the Sunite liturgy.

The caster united herself with a subject tree, allowing her to transform into a dryad. The priestess lost all of her divine abilities in exchange for the powers and skills of a true dryad. The transformation was quite stressful on the priestesses' body, sometimes resulting in their death.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a tree willing to accept the dryad to cast.
