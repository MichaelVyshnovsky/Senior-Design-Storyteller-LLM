        "mainbody": "Baleful polymorph was a transmutation spell that could change the form of a creature against its will.\nThe spell changed the form of a creature into that of an animal of small stature like that of a dog or ape at the choice of the caster. The target retained its philosophical orientation. The same applied to its hardiness and its capacity to understand languages. If the target was a shapechanger in the first place, then they remained so\nThe target lost all its other capabilities and because the body was changed, the targets equipment fell to the ground.\nIf the new chosen form was one that was unable to live in the current environment the creature was in,&mdashfor example, the form of a fish on the ground&mdashthe creature had an easier time to resist the forceful shapechange.\nOnce changed, the target remained in the new form for an indefinite time. Whatever form the new one was, if the target did not find a way to revert its form in twenty-four hours, its mental faculties degenerated to those of the new form.\nCreatures with gaseous or incorporeal bodies were immune to the spell.\nBaleful polymorph was a spell that required only verbal and somatic components."
