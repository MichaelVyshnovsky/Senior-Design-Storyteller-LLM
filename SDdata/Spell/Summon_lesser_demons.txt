Summon lesser demons was a conjuration spell that summoned a number of weak demons from the depths of the Abyss.
Upon speaking profane words, the spell conjured a random number of demons the weaker the summoned creatures were, the more numerous they could be. It could summon either two quasits or maw demons, or four to eight manes, dretches, or abyssal wretches, but other combinations were possible. As the caster grew in power and experience, the number of summoned demons also increased.
The demons appeared at visible points of the casters choice within a range of . They then proceeded to attack every creature in sight that was not a demon, including the caster, starting with the ones that were closest to them. The caster could form a protective circle large enough to surround one human-sized creature, using up the blood that was required to cast the spell. The summoned demons could not cross the circle or harm anyone inside it.
The demons remained summoned for up to 1 hour, as long as the caster kept concentrating, or until killed. They immediately disappeared when killed or when the spell ended.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was blood from a humanoid killed within 24 hours of the casting of the spell. The blood could not be reused as a component if used to draw the protective magic circle.
