'''''Summon lesser demons''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that summoned a number of weak [[demon]]s from the depths of the [[Abyss]].

==Effects==
Upon speaking profane words, the spell conjured a random number of demons; the weaker the summoned creatures were, the more numerous they could be. It could summon either two [[quasit]]s or [[maw demon]]s, or four to eight [[mane]]s, [[dretch]]es, or [[abyssal wretch]]es, but other combinations were possible. As the caster grew in power and experience, the number of summoned demons also increased.

The demons appeared at visible points of the caster's choice within a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. They then proceeded to attack every creature in sight that was not a demon, including the caster, starting with the ones that were closest to them. The caster could form a protective circle large enough to surround one [[human]]-sized creature, using up the blood that was required to cast the spell. The summoned demons could not cross the circle or harm anyone inside it.

The demons remained summoned for up to 1 hour, as long as the caster kept concentrating, or until killed. They immediately disappeared when killed or when the spell ended.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal component|verbal]], [[somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was blood from a humanoid killed within 24 hours of the casting of the spell. The blood could not be reused as a component if used to draw the protective magic circle.
