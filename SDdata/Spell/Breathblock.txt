'''''Breathblock''''' was a defensive [[spell]] that could only be cast by [[dragon]]s.

==Effects==
The spell was similar to the ''[[Shield (spell)|shield]]'' spell used by humanoid [[wizard]]s. When cast, an invisible barrier of force manifested around the dragon or an area. The barrier was {{SI|50|ft}} on each side. The barrier was mobile, so it could be used by a dragon as a [[shield]]. If used against the breath weapon of another dragon, the weapon's effects are either deflected away or reflected back to the attacking dragon.

==Casting==
This spell required only a [[verbal]] component.
