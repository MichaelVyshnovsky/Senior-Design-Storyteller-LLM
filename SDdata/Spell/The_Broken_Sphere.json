Following clues from an ancient [[Gnome|gnomish]] library and the vision he sees, he traces the mighty craft through the [[crystal sphere]]s. He employs his [[Cloak of the Firs Pilot|magical cloak's]] powers and discovers his quarry's home, but Teldin's cloak—and the possibility it could give him control over the ''Spelljammer''—continues to draw enemies, often in the guise of friends. Will he survive long enough to face the final danger that awaits him at the point of the ''Spelljammer's'' origin—the [[Broken Sphere]]?}}",
