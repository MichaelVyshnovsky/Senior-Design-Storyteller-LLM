        "mainbody": "he Hammer of Tyr was a holy relic of the church of Tyr, god of justice.\nA powerful weapon against evil and the undead, it could cast extraordinarily powerful turn undead and sunray spells, as well as heal allies. The Hammer could be also be used as a +5 warhammer and when thrown it returned to the wielders hand.\nPerhaps the Hammers greatest power was to destroy pools of darkness when thrown into its waters."
