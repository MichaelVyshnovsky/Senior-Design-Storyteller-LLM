'''''Shades of Rhondang''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to [[priest]]s of [[Flandal Steelskin]], the Pyromancer. It temporarily imbued the caster's [[hammer]] with the properties of a ''[[flame tongue]]'' sword.

==Effects==
This spell could only be used on the caster's own, non-magical hammer. If cast on any another weapon or tool, the spell fizzled. Likewise, the spell immediately ended if the caster lost contact with the hammer, became unconscious, died, or a ''[[dispel magic]]'' effect was successfully performed on the hammer. Because the caster had to maintain a grip on the flaming weapon, they could not cast other spells that required a [[somatic component]] or perform actions that required both hands. The effects of ''shades of Rhondang'' lasted for at least seven minutes (longer for more experienced casters). While the hammer was aflame, it had the properties of a ''flame tongue'' sword. It produced light like a [[torch]], could ignite flammable items, and was particularly effective against cold-using creatures, regenerating creatures, avians, and the [[undead]].

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[material component]]s, and the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast. The material component was the caster's hammer, which was not consumed in the casting and returned to normal after the spell dissipated.

==History==
Flandal Steelskin's hammer, ''[[Rhondang]]'', had many magical properties, and thus the name ''shades of Rhondang'' indicated that the caster's hammer was granted ''some'' of these properties.
