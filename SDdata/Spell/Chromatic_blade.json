        "mainbody": "'''''Chromatic blade''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that created a special magical blade that changed colors.",
        "Effects": "The colors of the blade shifted constantly. Touching any part of the blade would cause instant harm. The weapon itself was weightless and could be wielded by anyone, though the caster could will it out of existence at any point. Though small, a ''chromatic blade'' could sever limbs just like a ''[[sword of sharpness]]''. It could only be destroyed by successfully ''[[Dispel magic|dispelling]]'' it, or by ''[[Disintegrate|disintegration]]'' or a ''[[limited wish]]''. The blade would also shatter upon severing the limb of anyone wearing heavily enchanted [[armor]].\n\nThe wielder of a ''chromatic blade'' was protected from all ''[[color spray]]'' attacks including'' [[prismatic spray]]''. The blade would destroy one layer or color of a ''[[prismatic sphere]]'' upon contact but then be destroyed.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] a small lightning-forged [[dagger]] set with [[gem]]s of all seven spectrum colors to cast.",
        "History": "This spell was found in the [[tome]] ''[[Tasso's Arcanabula]]''."
