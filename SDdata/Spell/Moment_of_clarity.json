        "mainbody": "Moment of clarity was a divine abjuration spell that let a paladin help another creature shake off mind-affecting spells or effects.\nOn casting the spell, the paladin touched another being who was the victim of a mind-affecting spell or other effect and gave them an immediate second chance to break free of it. However, if that spell or effect allow the victim to break free on their own, moment of clarity could not aid them.\nIt was verbal and somatic components and a divine focus."
