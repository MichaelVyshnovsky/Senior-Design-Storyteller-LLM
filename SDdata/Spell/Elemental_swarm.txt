Elemental swarm was a conjuration spell that summoned between two and eight large elementals, one to four huge elementals, and one greater elemental, whose element depended on the plane from which they were summoned.The spells descriptor corresponded to the element invoked.
The spell opened a portal to one of the Elemental Planes—Air, Earth, Fire, or Water—through which they could summon elementals of that plane. A druid could select any of these places, while a cleric could only access the plane corresponding to their elemental domain (without which they couldnt cast the spell at all). The spell took 10 minutes to cast and then the first creatures appeared at a chosen location within a few hundred feet (80+ meters) of the caster.
On completion of casting, two to eight large elementals appeared. Ten minutes later, one to four huge elementals appeared. After another ten minutes, one greater elemental appeared. All summoned creatures obeyed the caster and would not turn on the caster even if someone else took control of them. The elementals stayed on the plane of the caster for a minimum of about three hours or until the caster dismissed them, individually or in groups, whichever came first.
Only verbal and somatic components were needed to cast this spell.
