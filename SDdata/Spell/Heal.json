        "mainbody": "'''''Heal''''' was a [[conjuration]], [[evocation]], or [[necromancy]] spell that cured many ailments and restored health. The reverse of this spell, '''''[[harm]]''''', could drain health away, bringing a creature to near unconsciousness and death.",
        "Effects": "The caster had to touch the recipient of this spell for it to work. \n\nThe original necromantic version of this spell restored a creature to full health, cured all diseases, restored sight, and cured mental disorders caused by brain injury or magic such as ''[[feeblemind]]''. \n\nAfter the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic]], the conjuration version delivered a charge of [[positive energy]] that had an upper limit on how much health it could restore, but it also cured blindness, deafness, disease, insanity, poison, sickness of all sorts, and the effects of spells such as ''[[confusion]]'', and ''[[feeblemind]]''.\n\nIf cast in reverse, ''harm'' brought a living creature to the brink of unconsciousness and inflicted a disease on the victim.\n\nIf either version was successfully cast on an [[undead]] creature, it acted like the corresponding ''[[harm]]'' spell.",
        "Components": "The spell needed only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components to be cast.",
        "Notable Uses": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], [[Luna]] used a ''heal'' spell to damage and disabled a trio of [[night rider]]s in the streets of [[Waterdeep]]. It allowed her and her friends to get away.{{Cite comic/Total Eclipse|13}}"
