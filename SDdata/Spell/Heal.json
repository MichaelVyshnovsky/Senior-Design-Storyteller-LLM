        "mainbody": "Heal was a conjuration, evocation, or necromancy spell that cured many ailments and restored health. The reverse of this spell, harm, could drain health away, bringing a creature to near unconsciousness and death.\nThe caster had to touch the recipient of this spell for it to work. \nThe original necromantic version of this spell restored a creature to full health, cured all diseases, restored sight, and cured mental disorders caused by brain injury or magic such as feeblemind. \nAfter the Year of Wild Magic, the conjuration version delivered a charge of positive energy that had an upper limit on how much health it could restore, but it also cured blindness, deafness, disease, insanity, poison, sickness of all sorts, and the effects of spells such as confusion, and feeblemind.\nIf cast in reverse, harm brought a living creature to the brink of unconsciousness and inflicted a disease on the victim.\nIf either version was successfully cast on an undead creature, it acted like the corresponding harm spell.\nThe spell needed only verbal and somatic components to be cast.\nDuring the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, Luna used a heal spell to damage and disabled a trio of night riders in the streets of Waterdeep. It allowed her and her friends to get away."
