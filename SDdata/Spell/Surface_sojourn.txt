Surface sojourn was a spell used by clerics of Deep Sashelas.
This spell allowed such creatures as aquatic elves, aquatic half-elves, malenti, merfolk and sahuagin to exist on land without experiencing the normal physical discomfort and stresses. The spell acted by enveloping the targeted creatures skin with a thin layer of water 
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Deep Sashelas and the shell from a snail.
