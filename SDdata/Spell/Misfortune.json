        "mainbody": "Misfortune was a divine spell used by priests devoted to Beshaba.\nThis spell caused the recipient to experience moderate bad luck with practically any act they performed.\nThe caster needed to touch the target with a bare hand for the spell to function. The caster could end the spell at will, otherwise only a dispel magic or remove curse spell would end it permaturely.\nThis spell required only somatic components to cast."
