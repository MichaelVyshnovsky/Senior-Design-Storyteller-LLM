Dragon blight was a spell that was used against dragons. 
When cast, a shimmering green cloud enveloped a target dragon. The dragon, and any other dragonkind within the cloud, experienced excruciating pain, a pain so intense that any creature within was left stunned after the spell expired. 
This spell required verbal and somatic components. However, if the caster included a claw from a deep dragon while casting the spell, it  increased the likelihood of the spell stunning the targeted dragon.
