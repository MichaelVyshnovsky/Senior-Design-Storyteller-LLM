        "mainbody": "'''Rocs''' were gargantuan birds of prey that inhabited the highest mountains in warm and subtropical regions.\n\nAs large as these great birds were, they paled in both size and ferocity to the mighty [[Zakharan roc]]s of the [[Zakhara|Land of Fate]].",
        "Description": "Rocs were massive avians with feathers that were normally either dark brown or golden in color, although rare black, red, or white rocs were sometimes reported. From the head to the base of the tail, rocs were a minimum of {{SI|30|ft}} long, and as much as {{SI|60|ft}}. Their wingspans were a staggering {{SIrange|80|120|ft}}, and rocs weighed some {{SI|8000|lb|k}}.",
        "Combat": "[[File:Rocking rocs.png|thumb|''Adventurers be warned: Stealing roc eggs is inadvisable!''|350x350px]]\nRocs hunted, and attacked, by swooping down from the sky with talons outstretched to snatch and carry off prey. A single roc would be hunting, and therefore willing to try and take any suitably sized creature, but a pair of rocs would act in concert and fight to the death to defend the nest and eggs or hatchlings.",

        "Uses": "Rocs were occasionally tamed and used by [[giant]]s.<ref>\n\nRoc feathers were commonly used in manufacturing ''[[Quaal's feather token]]s'' and ''[[Broom of flying|brooms of flying]]''.",
        "Homelands": "[[File:Roc egg B&M.jpg|thumb|right|''The egg of a roc and the most dangerous omelette ever.'']]\nRocs were found in the [[Utter East]], making their nests in the [[Serpent Valley]], [[Web Mountains]], and even underground in the [[Realm of Fire]]. Their nests could hold treasure from past victims, if one dared brave the parent and hatchling.",
        "History": "Lord [[Charles Frederik LaVerne Blacktree IV]] was known for wearing a roc feather in his hat.<ref>"
