        "mainbody": "'''''Drowsy insects''''' was a common spell used by [[wu jen]]. The spell was very rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell summoned a cloud of insects. These biting and stinging insects swarmed every creature in the spell's area of effect. A creature with a protection of cold, [[fire]], or smoke was unaffected. While the stings themselves caused little pain, a creature would be affected by the insects' [[poison]], and would fall asleep. This was not a deep sleep or a coma, if the affected creature was disturbed by shaking or noise, they awakened. \n\nIf a wu jen attempted to cast this spell in the [[Phlogiston]], the spell would fail.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a live stinging insect such as a honeybee or wasp."
