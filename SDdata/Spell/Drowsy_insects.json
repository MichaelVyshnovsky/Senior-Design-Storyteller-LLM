        "mainbody": "Drowsy insects was a common spell used by wu jen. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the spell summoned a cloud of insects. These biting and stinging insects swarmed every creature in the spells area of effect. A creature with a protection of cold, fire, or smoke was unaffected. While the stings themselves caused little pain, a creature would be affected by the insects poison, and would fall asleep. This was not a deep sleep or a coma, if the affected creature was disturbed by shaking or noise, they awakened. \nIf a wu jen attempted to cast this spell in the Phlogiston, the spell would fail.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a live stinging insect such as a honeybee or wasp."
