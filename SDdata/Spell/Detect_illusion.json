        "mainbody": "Detect illusion was a common spell used by illusionists to detect illusions.\nWhen cast, the caster was able to both see an illusion and know it was an illusion. Individuals around the illusion would see it if the caster made physical contact with the illusion while the spell was in effect. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a piece of either crystal, glass or mica. Whichever component was chosen, it had to be tinted with a yellow dye."
