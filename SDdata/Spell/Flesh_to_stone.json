        "mainbody": "'''''Flesh to stone''''' was a [[spell]] that caused the target to be turned into a mindless, inert, stone statue. The reverse form, '''''stone to flesh''''', could restore a body thus afflicted back to life, though there was a chance that it might not survive the shock of this transition. If applied to ordinary stone, the spell created the corresponding amount of dead flesh.",
        "Effect": "The target and all that it wore would be turned to stone and if the statue was damaged and the spell removed the target came out just as damaged. ''Flesh to stone'' had a range of at least 100 ft (30 m).\n\nWhen a person was returned to flesh using this spell, after suffering from [[petrification]], they often felt stiff for a period of time.{{Cite comic/Fools Rush In}}",
        "Components": "This spell needed [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, [[lime (material)|lime]] and [[water]] and [[Earth (element)|earth]]. ''Stone to flesh'' required very small amounts of earth and blood.",
        "History": "The reverse form of this spell, ''stone to flesh'', was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Mavin]] in {{Yearlink|-465}} and was originally known as '''''Mavin's stone-flesh transmution'''''."
