        "mainbody": "Flesh to stone was a spell that caused the target to be turned into a mindless, inert, stone statue. The reverse form, stone to flesh, could restore a body thus afflicted back to life, though there was a chance that it might not survive the shock of this transition. If applied to ordinary stone, the spell created the corresponding amount of dead flesh.\nThe target and all that it wore would be turned to stone and if the statue was damaged and the spell removed the target came out just as damaged. Flesh to stone had a range of at least 100 ft (30 m).\nWhen a person was returned to flesh using this spell, after suffering from petrification, they often felt stiff for a period of time.\nThis spell needed verbal and somatic components, lime and water and earth. Stone to flesh required very small amounts of earth and blood.\nThe reverse form of this spell, stone to flesh, was attributed to Netherese arcanist Mavin in  and was originally known as Mavins stone-flesh transmution."
