        "mainbody": "Foxs cunning was a transmutation spell that increased the chance to perform any skill requiring intelligence.\nThe caster had to touch the target of this spell in order to cast it. The recipient was granted a few minutes of mental acuity, perception, and quick thinking. Spellcasters that relied on intelligence were not able to gain more spell capacity, but the spells they cast while under the influence of foxs cunning were harder to resist.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of a holy symbol or divine focus for bards, and a pinch of fox dung or a bit of fox fur for arcane spellcasters."
