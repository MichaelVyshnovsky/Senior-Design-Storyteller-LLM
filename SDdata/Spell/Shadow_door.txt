Shadow door, originally known as Shadows door, was a common illusion spell that allowed the wizard to pass through an illusory door, making them invisible.
The spell created an illusion that appeared as a door. The spellcaster could step through the illusion and "disappear". However, it actually caused the caster to become invisible, fooling many creatures. The fooled creatures could even inspect the door, seeing it lead into an empty 10 ft by 10 ft room. With them fully distracted and convinced that the caster had disappeared, the mage could unleash an attack on the unexpecting creature. The duration of the invisibility scaled with the experience of the caster.
Shadow door did not affect creatures with innate truesight, or a creature under the effect of the true seeing spell, as well as other magical detection methods.
Unlike almost all spells, shadow door only needed a somatic component.
The spell was created in  by, and named after, the Netherese arcanist Telamont Tanthul, who also went by the name Shadow.
