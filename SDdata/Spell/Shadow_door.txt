'''''Shadow door''''', originally known as '''''Shadow's door''''', was a common [[illusion]] [[spell]] that allowed the [[wizard]] to pass through an illusory door, making them invisible.

==Effects==
The spell created an illusion that appeared as a door. The spellcaster could step through the illusion and "disappear". However, it actually caused the caster to become invisible, fooling many creatures. The fooled creatures could even inspect the door, seeing it lead into an empty 10 ft by 10 ft room. With them fully distracted and convinced that the caster had disappeared, the mage could unleash an attack on the unexpecting creature. The duration of the invisibility scaled with the experience of the caster.

''Shadow door'' did not affect creatures with innate [[truesight]], or a creature under the effect of the ''[[true seeing]]'' spell, as well as other [[magic]]al detection methods.

==Components==
Unlike almost all spells, ''shadow door'' only needed a [[somatic]] component.

==History==
The spell was created in {{Yearlink|-600}} by, and named after, the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Telamont Tanthul]], who also went by the name Shadow.
