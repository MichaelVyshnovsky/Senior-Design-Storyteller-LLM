'''''Soul cage''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that temporarily trapped the soul of a recently deceased [[humanoid]], allowing the caster to exploit it in several different ways.

==Effects==
The spell, cast at the moment of death of a humanoid within a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}, trapped the creature's soul in a tiny cage for up to 8 hours, or until the cage was destroyed. The creature whose soul was trapped could not be revived while the spell was in effect.

The soul could be exploited in a variety of ways, up to six times, after which it was freed from its confinement:

;Steal Life: The caster drained the trapped soul's vitality for moderate healing.
;Query Soul: The caster [[telepathy|telepathically]] asked a question to the soul, who responded it truthfully to the best of its knowledge in life.
;Borrow Experience: The caster drew from the soul's life experiences to improve the odds of succeeding at a certain task.
;Eyes of the Dead: The caster deployed the soul to a place it knew in life that was in the same [[plane of existence]] as the caster. It acted like an invisible sensor, providing sensory information to the caster for up to 10 minutes. The tormented soul could be seen by creatures with [[truesight]] or under the effect of ''[[see invisibility]]''.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal component|verbal]], [[somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was a tiny [[silver]] cage worth 100 [[gp]].
