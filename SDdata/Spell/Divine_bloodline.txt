Divine bloodline was a divine divination spell used by specialty priests devoted to Siamorphe called Highborns, enabling them to determine noble lineage.
This spell allowed the caster to determine noble blood within the target and how closely related they were to a known noble, including bloodlines long forgotten in history. The casters skill determined how far back along the lineage they could trace and the number of bloodlines present for any given target.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol to cast.
