'''''Creeping cold''''' was a [[druid]]ic [[transmutation]] [[spell]] from the second circle of magic that dealt cold damage.

==Effects==
When the spell was unleash on any one creature within {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}} from the caster, their sweat was turned to ice that left blistering cold burns all over the body, on the surface and inside the skin. The freeze-burning continued on for nineteen seconds, dealing more damage as more seconds passed.

==Components==
The spell required a druidic ''[[spell focus]]'' â€“ a pottery or a glass container with ice, worth at least 25 [[gp]]; as well as a [[Somatic component|somatic]] and a [[verbal component]].
