        "mainbody": "'''''Deathwatch''''' was a [[divine]] [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that informed the caster how badly wounded subjects were.",
        "Effects": "With the power of unlife, the caster acquired a necromantic vision with which they could tell the status of living creatures close to death within an area of {{SI|30|ft}}. He or she immediately sensed if a creature was dead or close to death from wounds, [[undead]], or neither alive nor dead (as in the case of [[construct]]s). This spell foiled any magic or ability with which creatures could fake death.\n\nCertain [[deity|deities]] granted this spell for non-evil purposes.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast."
