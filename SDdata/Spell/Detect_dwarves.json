The spell was capable of detecting azer, derro, duergar, half-dwarves and even dead dwarves or dwarven blood. Even if hidden by an illusion-based spell, invisible, or shapechanged.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, the holy symbol of Sharindlar."
