'''''There/not there''''' was a [[wild magic]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by [[wild mage]]s.

==Effects==
This spell created a random fluctuation in the probabilities of existence. It could only be used on non-living objects within a cube with the sides measuring {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}}.

Objects within the cube either remained visible or disappeared. The state of existence for these objects was randomly determined and varied by the viewer and with each viewing.

A real-world example of how this spell might be used would be a wizard casting it on an otherwise unpassable doorway. There was a chance the doorway would simply not be there when viewed by the wizard, and their companions, allowing them to walk through unhindered. However, if the wizard saw the doorway as not there, but a companion saw the doorway as there, then only the wizard could pass through. An object that was not there did not have any other impact on its surrounding aside from not being visible. For example, a pillar holding up a ceiling viewed as "not there" would not cause the ceiling to collapse.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a small piece of [[cat]] fur sealed in a small box to cast.
