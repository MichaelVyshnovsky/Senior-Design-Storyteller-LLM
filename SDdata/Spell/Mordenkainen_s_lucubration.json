        "mainbody": "Mordenkainens lucubration was an uncommon spell that allowed a caster to instantly remember a spell.\nWhen cast, the caster was able to remember any spell they had successfully cast in the previous 24 hours. They were only able to recall low-to-mid level spells and only a single spell. If the recalled spell required material components to cast, the caster had to have them available to successfully re-cast the spell.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components."
