'''''Feather fall''''' (also written as '''''featherfall''''') was a [[spell]] that caused creatures or objects to fall slowly, like a feather.

==Effects==
An early form of the spell had a duration and weight limit set by the experience and the power of the caster.

A later form of ''feather fall'' instantly changed the rate at which the target fell to an unnaturally steady rate of ten feet per second. The target of the spell was not damaged upon landing while the spell was in effect. Again the duration of the spell was limited by the experience and power of the caster. However, this spell had no weight limit, instead it was limited by size and number of targets. This spell could be cast in a moment.

===Post-Spellplague===
After the [[Spellplague]], this spell's effects lasted until the target touched the ground again. ''Feather fall'' was complex enough that its caster had to wait a day before casting it again.

==Users==
[[Beholder]]s had a [[permanent]] ''feather fall'' effect. [[Silver dragon]]s could use a ''feather fall'' [[spell]]-like ability.

==History==
The [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Yturn]] was given for the credit for the creation of this spell in {{Yearlink|-1158}}, then known as '''''Yturn's feather fall'''''.<ref>

''Feather fall'' was a common spell in the Realms by the midâ€“14th century [[DR]].

==Notable Uses==
During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], [[Naneatha Suaril]] pushed the [[avatar]] of [[Shar]] off a high balcony of the [[House of the Moon]]. However, Shar cast ''featherfall'', causing both of them to land safely.{{Cite comic/Total Eclipse|8}} Later that year, the marauding [[Fellandar]] hurled the [[dwarf]] [[Onyx the Invincible]] high into the air. [[Kyriani]] caught him with a ''feather fall'' spell and brought him safely to earth.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City|6}}
