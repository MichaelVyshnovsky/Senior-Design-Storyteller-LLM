The shillelagh () spell enhanced a wooden weapon, such as a club or a staff to do more harm in combat.
The weapon to be enchanted had to be non-magical, made of oak, and not shod with metal. If someone other than the caster wielded the shillelagh, the bonus to skill and damage did not manifest. The effects lasted for a few minutes longer for more experienced casters.
All versions of this spell required an oaken club or staff, the casters holy symbol or divine focus, plus verbal and somatic components. The alteration versions also required a shamrock leaf, as well as the post-Second Sundering version, which also required mistletoe.
