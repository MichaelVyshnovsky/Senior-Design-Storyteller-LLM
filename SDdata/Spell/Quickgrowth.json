        "mainbody": "'''''Quickgrowth''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The reverse of this spell was called ''wither''. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "A shugenja used this spell to speed up the growth of a plant or plantlike creature. It did not alter the size or characteristics of a plant; rather, it caused the plant to blossom or bear fruit out of season. The rate of growth was determined by the shugenja's skill. The effect was instantaneous. Once cast, the plant resumed its normal growth cycle.\n\nThe reverse of this spell, ''wither'', caused plants or plant-like creatures to reverse their growth cycle, becoming withered and dying. With plants, this process was instantaneous, but a strong plant-like creature was able to resist the effects of ''wither''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell and its reverse required a [[material component]], namely a [[staff]]."
