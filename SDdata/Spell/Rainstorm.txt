Rainstorm was a divine evocation spell granted to druidss and rangers by their deities.
The rainstorm spell conjured forth a  square area of strong magical rain within their eyesight. The rain damaged all creatures of cold or fiery nature as long as the spell lasted. Additionally, all creatures within the rainstorm area had a cointoss of a chance of being struck by a lightning every six seconds they spent within the area of the spells effect. All flaming spells, such as flame blade or fire shroud, and fire elemental effects, such as the blazing aura of a salamander, were immediately extinguished. The spell lasted for twelve seconds.
