Wheat into blade was a divine alteration spell that allowed a cleric to transform a part of a plant into an enchanted spear.
When this spell was cast, the caster transformed the stalk of any plant into a non-metallic, 7-foot-long (2.1 meters) spear that possessed a +2 enchantment.
Multiple castings of the spell could be used to create a single, unbreakable pole.
If wheat into blade was cast upon a magically controlled plant, it functioned as the spell hold plant.
The specifications of the spell were inscribed upon one of the "inner petals" of the Chauntean relic, the Glarathra.
This spell required verbal and somatic components, as well as the stalk of a living plant that was at least knee-high in length.
