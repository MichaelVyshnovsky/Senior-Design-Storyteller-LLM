'''''Wheat into blade''''' was a [[divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that allowed a [[cleric]] to transform a part of a plant into an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[spear]].

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, the caster transformed the stalk of any plant into a non-metallic, 7-foot-long (2.1 meters) spear that possessed a ''+2 enchantment''.

Multiple castings of the spell could be used to create a single, unbreakable pole.

If ''wheat into blade'' was cast upon a [[magic]]ally controlled plant, it functioned as the spell ''[[hold plant]]''.

==History==
The specifications of the spell were inscribed upon one of the "inner petals" of the [[Chauntea]]n [[relic]], the ''[[Glarathra]]''.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, as well as the stalk of a living plant that was at least knee-high in length.
