        "mainbody": "Massmorph was an arcane alteration spell that allowed the caster to alter the form of several willing subjects into trees.\nThis spell only worked on willing participants, allowing the caster to transform many individuals into a specific type of tree. The subjects appeared to be real trees to all senses, but if physically harmed they would bleed as normal. The spell lasted until either the caster released the magic or it was successfully dispelled.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a handful of bark chips from the specific tree that the subjects would transform into to cast.\nThis spell was used by the avatar of Verenestra."
