'''''Cloud trapeze''''' was a common spell used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
When cast, the spell created a magical cloud, which transported a wu jen at incredible speed. The wu jen had complete control over the cloud's direction. A wu jen was able to transport one humanoid-sized creature; the number of additional passengers was dependent on the skill level of the wu jen. The cloud was able to travel up to 100 miles (160 kilometers).  

The spell also protected the riders from weather: if a wu jen rode the magical cloud into a storm, they would remain dry and unaffected by the wind. When the caster reached their destination, the cloud slowly descended and then vanished when the caster was on the ground.

When in [[wildspace]], the magical cloud was unable to travel outside the atmosphere of a [[spelljammer]].

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a ball of [[cotton]].
