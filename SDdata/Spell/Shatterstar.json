        "mainbody": "Shatterstar was an attack spell, effective against gaseous or incorporeal creatures.\nThe spell inflicted horrific burning upon its target, making mists explode the flames lingered briefly afterwards.\nThe spell was unsuccessfully used by Mardasper Oblyndrin, the guardian of Moonshorn Tower, a Mystran temple, when it was infiltrated by an enigmatic entity known as the Slayer. Once Mardasper pinpointed the creature, he let loose with the spell. Though it was obviously effective, it proved insufficient to disable it."
