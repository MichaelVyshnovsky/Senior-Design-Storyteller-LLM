        "mainbody": "Sunfire, also known as Atars fire, was a spell used by wizards in Anauroch and Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nThis spell harnessed the power of the sun to create an explosive ball of flame. Most creatures killed by this spell were burned to ash. This spell was similar to a fireball spell with the exception that the caster, and all of his or her gear, were immune to the flames.\nThis spell required a ball of sticky gum to cast."
