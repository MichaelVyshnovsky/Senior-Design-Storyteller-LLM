Veil of Djalice, also called the glamour glamer, was a divine illusion spell used by priests devoted to Sune, enabling them to temporarily enhance a targets beauty to otherworldly levels.
This spell was named after the priestess Djalice who developed it.
This spell altered the targets beauty and grace to unimaginable levels. Individuals of the same race as the target were completely smitten with them for the spells duration provided they were not deaf or blind. The veil of Djalice lasted for six minutes.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
