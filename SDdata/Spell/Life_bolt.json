        "mainbody": "'''''Life bolt''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell created a beam of positive energy from the life force of the caster. The caster could target a single or multiple creatures. If the caster was attacking multiple targets, they had to be no more than {{SI|30|ft}} apart. The amount of beams the caster could create was determined by their skill level.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.",
        "History": "This spell was invented by [[Stavros|Stavros of the Skulls]], the [[Cyric]]ist [[necromancer]], as a result of an incident involving losing control of zombies. At the order of the [[Lord's Court]] of [[Waterdeep]], he was ordered to create and develop four beneficial spells of the [[necromancy|necromantic school]] or be forced to return to the bowels of [[Undermountain]], a place from which he had just returned three months prior. He complied, and and this spell was one of the four he gave to the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]].\n\n[[Melegost Starseer]], a [[Magister]] of [[Mystra]], once described this spell as an ideal spell which represented the values of the goddess herself."
