'''Realmspace''' was the term used to describe the [[Toril]]ian system and its surrounding environs within the [[Prime Material Plane]]. To those on the surface of Toril, Realmspace was called the '''Sea of Night''',

==The Solar System==
===The Sun===
{{main|The Sun}}
The largest [[fire body]] of Realmspace was located at its center and radiated a comfortable amount of warmth throughout the entire sphere. It was particularly susceptible to solar flares, which erupted almost continually.

===Anadia===
{{main|Anadia}}
One of the two [[Dawn Heralds]], this small, amber-and-green-colored planet

===Coliar===
{{main|Coliar}}
Coliar was a gas giant mostly populated with avian life-forms and other flying creatures. [[Earthmote|Floating islands]] of water and earth revolved around the planet's core. [[Elminster]] was said to own a [[Elminster's Hideout|resort]] on one of these islands. The planet was covered with clouds and appeared as a gray-white sphere from Toril. It was considered one of the Dawn Heralds.

===Toril===
{{main|Toril}}
The third planet in the system was the most populated, teeming with life. Approximately 60% of the surface being covered with water, fauna on Toril ranged from creatures living in the air, on the land, under the water and subterranean habitats. This planet was formerly known as [[Abeir-Toril]].

====Abeir====
{{main|Abeir}}

Toril's "twin planet", existing near Toril's orbit but located within a "pocket dimension" that was out of synchronicity with the rest of Realmspace. It had roughly the same characteristics of Toril.{{cite web |url=http://secretsofthearchmages.net/Threads/Wotc/2015/ForgottenRealms/1514971.htm|title=The one and only "Ask the Realms authors/designers thread" 4|accessmonthday=January 29th|accessyear=2017|author=[[Richard Baker]]|date=August 12th, 2008}}

====Selûne====
{{main|Selûne (moon)}}
Selûne was Toril's largest natural satellite. It orbited about {{SI|183000|mi|k|long=yes}} from Toril,For reference, in the real world, [[Earth]]'s Moon is {{SI|240000|mile|k|long=yes}} from Earth. It is reasonable to assume that the authors of the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'']] simply made a typo and missed a zero in their figure. Only one side of it ever faced the planet; the other side was called the "dark side", yet it was not always dark. This was where most activity took place. Although Torilians had named it after the [[deity]] [[Selûne]], the moon's own inhabitants named their home after [[Leira]]. Trailing in the orbit of this satellite were the [[Tears of Selûne]].

===Karpri===
{{main|Karpri}}
The first of the [[Five Wanderers]], Karpri, From Toril it appeared as a large star but as a sapphire ball with white caps when viewed by magical means. The poles were covered in pack ice hundreds of miles thick and stalked by deadly cold-loving predators, while floating on the equator's waters could be found seaweed, which at some points could support up to five tons of weight but were also home to massive, dangerous insects. The waters of the world were inhabited by [[aquatic elf|aquatic elves]] and predacious sea life, making this planet as dangerous as it was beautiful.

===Chandos===
{{main|Chandos}}
The next of the Five Wanderers, From Toril, this planet appeared as a greenish-brown smudge, which changed over time.

===Glyth===
{{main|Glyth}}
The third of the Five Wanderers was a gray planet that had a beautiful ring and three satellites observable from Toril. Plant life was continually burned by the harsh atmosphere or by the mind flayers to prevent their humanoid cattle hiding from them. A remarkably pure, edible gelatin "water" could be found in the place of seas, and while the planet still had ice caps as normal, nothing lived there. Most activity occured underground. As well as the [[Glyth#The Rings of Glyth|planet's rings]], Glyth was orbited by three satellites. One, known as [[Glyth#Haven|Haven]], was a hollowed out asteroid and treated as neutral ground for the different mind flayer factions. Another, [[Glyth#Mingabwe|Mingabwe]], was a trading port for non-illithids. Orbiting Mingabwe was [[Glyth#Polluter|Polluter]], an unmapped asteroid. A group of over 300 mercenaries from the [[Code Helm]] resided here conducting raids against illithids in the system.<ref>

===Garden===
{{main|Garden}}
Garden was not actually a planet. It was a series of earthy-masses connected together by a massive plant. Non-sentient life-forms created a balanced ecosystem with the many varieties of plant life growing here, but otherwise it was populated by pirates. Garden was also orbited by twelve satellites. Garden could rarely be seen from Toril, but when it was spotted, it appeared as a tiny green speck.

===H'Catha===
{{main|H'Catha}}
The last of Toril's Five Wanderers, H'Catha, appeared as a crystalline glimmer of white.

===Far Realm-infested Stars===
At some point before {{Yearlink|1396}}, and as consequence of the actions of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]], some entities from the [[Far Realm]] invaded Realmspace and took a place among the stars. Although these beings looked liked stars, in truth these beings were [[elder evil]]s.

==The Crystal Shell==
[[File:Realmspace-map-2e.jpg|thumb|350px|''A map of Realmspace showing the [[wikipedia:orbital inclination|orbital inclinations]] of all planets and K'Thoutek.'']]
The crystal shell of Realmspace had a radius of 3.2 billion miles (5.15 billion km). Like all crystal spheres of this size, it appeared to be perfectly flat from the inside or from the outside. The shell was immune to damage of any kind and prevented the phlogiston from entering its wildspace interior.

The Realmspace crystal shell had a unique feature: its interior was lined by cryptic glyphs and wards, printed in illegible characters that were several hundred miles tall. Any attempt to magically read one of those writings, if successful, triggered the ward, which released a [[spell]] hundreds of times larger and more destructive than normal. No two writings were alike and they could all be activated an infinite number of times. It was believed that those writings had been placed on the sphere as a means of protection, but their exact origin was unknown.

The dashes, dots, and tildes in the writings produced openings to the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Radiance]] that ranged between a few yards and hundreds of miles in diameter. These brilliant portals, thousands of miles apart from each other on the sphere's surface, were seen from its inhabitants as stars and constellations.

Although the Radiance plane was highly destructive to creatures and ships that dared enter it, portals through the sphere could be safely created on top of a star-opening, temporarily superseding it. For an inhabitant on one of the planets, that particular star would seem to disappear for a few minutes and then reappear.

The inner surface of the sphere was inhabited by a mysterious group of hundreds of thousands of humanoids known as [[the Wanderers]].

Some of the stars visible in the Northern hemisphere of Toril were named by the [[elf|elves]] of [[Eaerlann]]. A few of those were used to name the mountains in the [[Star Mounts]]. While most original names were forgotten, their translations in the mounts' names being all that remained, a few of their original names survived to the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]], such as the stars [[Y'tellarien]], or "The Far Star"; [[Y'landrothiel]], or "Traveler's Star"; and [[N'landroshien]], or "Darkness in Light". The reason why the [[Elven language|Elven]] star names were used to name the mountains was unknown and thought to be an ominous secret kept by the elves.

===Constellations===
{{Main|Constellation}}
Realmspace held a number of [[constellation]]s, arrangement of stars as viewed in the night sky.
* The [[Centaur (constellation)|Centaur]]{{Cite comic/Summer in the City|15}}
* The [[Woman Warrior]]
* [[Amaunator's belt]]

==Cosmography==
[[File:Inner flow-2e.jpg|thumb|200px|''Position of Realmspace in relation to the Arcane Inner Flow.'']]
The space around Realmspace was a [[Wikipedia:Vertex (geometry)|vertex]] in a stable triangle in the flow of the phlogiston. The other two vertices were in the location of [[Greyspace]], where the world of [[Oerth]] was found, and [[Krynnspace]], home of the world of [[Krynn]]. The phlogiston had a strong current that flowed between Realmspace and Greyspace, making two-way travel between the two crystal spheres relatively fast and simple. There were one-way flows from Greyspace to Krynnspace and from Krynnspace to Realmspace, but not in the opposite directions. Due to this current, it was impossible to travel directly from Realmspace to Krynnspace and from Krynnspace to Greyspace. For that reason, traveling from Realmspace to Krynnspace was easier if one went through Greyspace first instead of going directly.<ref name="AiS.CAS2e-p10-11,86,88>

A close neighbor of Realmspace was [[Refuge (crystal sphere)|Refuge]], a small crystal sphere that contained a spaceport controlled by the Arcane.{{Cite dragon/159/Rough Times on Refuge|10-14}} Refuge itself was a vertex in another stable configuration of the flow, known as the [[Arcane Inner Flow]], which contained the crystal spheres of [[Pirtelspace]] and the [[elf|elven]]-controlled sphere of [[Darnannon]].{{Cite dungeon/36/The Sea of Sorrow|40-45}}

==History==
The [[wildspace]] of the Realmspace crystal sphere was unusually warm compared to others. This led sages to speculate that the sun and Realmspace itself were the oldest among the generally known crystal spheres.

It was believed that the [[creator race]]s from Toril were the earliest intelligent inhabitants of Realmspace, and the first to develop the magical means necessary to travel to other crystal spheres and other planes, around the same time when inhabitants of other spheres also started to travel. These early migrations into Realmspace dated from the apex of the [[dragon|draconic]] domain over Toril. The first to arrive were [[dwarves]], followed by [[treant]]s, [[elves]], and, lastly, [[mind flayer]]s.

A second wave of migration, roughly coinciding with the time primitive [[human]]s started to develop their civilization and with the establishment of [[Ostoria]], heralded the arrival of [[halfling]]s, [[gnome]]s, [[merfolk]], [[giant-kin]], [[titan]]s, and [[triton]]s, as well as―unbeknownst to other races―[[sharn]] and [[phaerimm]].

Centuries later, around the time of the apex of Ostoria, a third wave of direct migrations from other crystal spheres saw the arrival of [[beholder]]s, [[lesser dragon]]s, [[leucrotta]], [[centaur]]s, [[satyr]]s, and [[wemic]]s, among others.

The last wave of migrations, estimated to have happened around the time humans learned magic from the elves, laying the foundations of what would later become [[Netheril]], saw the arrival of [[pegasi]] and other winged [[humanoid]] races.

During the [[Time of Troubles]], the chanting of the Wanderers had temporarily ceased due to the fall of Realmspace's powers. For the duration of this period, no portals could be opened through the crystal sphere.

Travelers in Realmspace were sometimes terrorized by a mysterious and intimidating bat-shaped vessel known as the ''[[Batship]]'', an invasive presence that originated in a remote crystal sphere and adopted Realmspace as its hunting grounds.
