'''''Stone form''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Callarduran Smoothhands]].
 
==Effects==
When cast, the willing targeted creature was temporarily transformed into living stone, similar to a [[stone golem]] or [[stone guardian]]. The recipients defense abilities increased and they gained immunity to many mundane attacks, such as acid, fire and mundane weapons. The recipient did become vulnerable to spells that targeted stone, such as ''[[stone shape]]'' and ''[[transmute rock to mud]]''.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Callarduran Smoothhands and a piece of rock from stone that was previously animated.
