        "Effects": "In order to channel divinity, the cleric had to conduct a ritual that lasted an hour. The ritual involved laying out the [[coins]] or other [[metal]] on top of a surface, that were equal in value to the thing that was to be created. Once the ritual had finished, an item that contained some sort of metal (tools, [[weapon]], [[armor]], etc) would coalease on top of a free unoccipied surface within {{SI|5|ft}}. The produced item could not be [[magic]]al or be worth greater than 100 [[gold pieces]]."
