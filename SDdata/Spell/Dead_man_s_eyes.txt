'''''Dead man's eyes''''' was an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[spell]] from the school of [[necromancy]] that allowed a [[wizard]] to kill with their eyes.

==Powers==
This spell turned the whites of the caster's eyes black with the pupils reshaped into small white skulls. The caster could gaze at a single target at a time within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}, killing or harming them if they met the caster's gaze. The deadly magic could be directed back at the caster if reflected by a mirror or other reflective surface.

==Components==
In addition to [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a pair of glass [[marbles]] the same color as the caster's eyes to cast.

==History==
This spell was found within the ''[[Book of Shadows]]'', a [[tome]] based upon the oration of the [[necromancer]] [[Nebt Bhakau]] of [[Zakhara]].
