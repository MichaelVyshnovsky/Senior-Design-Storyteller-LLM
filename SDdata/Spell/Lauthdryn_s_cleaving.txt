[[Lauthdryn's cleaving]] was a [[spell]] akin to [[lesser cleaving]] developed by [[Inhil Lauthdryn]].

==Effects==
Akin to yet stronger than [[lesser cleaving]], the spell slashed a tunnel of up to {{SI|90|yards|long=yes}} to the target across any physical barriers, ended any barrier spell that wasn't at least as powerful as the ''cleaving'' itself, and, at the caster's option, transported them to the vicinity of the target, empowering their next strike so that it would be unerring no matter what. Even further, if the caster so chose, they'd be whisked to their vicinity no matter what countermeasures were used by the target- moving, teleporting, or even shifting to another plane, the caster would be in position to strike within a blink.

However, the power of the spell carried intense, risky backlash, that damaged the caster; it also stripped a random spell from the caster's memorization, and if it could find none, it stole two charges from one of their possessions. In the absence of charges, it would disable one of their magic items for a couple or so days; if there were no magical items, the caster was bound to take permanent damage, perhaps higher than the initial backlash.

==Components==
Only [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components were necessary to cast this spell.

==History==
[[Azuth]] made this spell available through [[Elminster]] sometime prior to {{yearlink|1370}}.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|101}}
