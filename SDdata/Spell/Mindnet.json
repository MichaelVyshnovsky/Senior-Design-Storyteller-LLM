        "mainbody": "'''''Mindnet''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[divination]] and [[enchantment]] [[quest spell]] from the [[thought sphere]] that established telepathic links with other subjects.",
        "Effects": "The casting [[priest]] could connect telepathically with up to ten individuals provided they strayed no further than {{SI|10|mi|k|long=yes}} from each other. Thus, a chain of communication {{SI|100|mi|k|long=yes}} long could be established. The amount of time needed to cast ''mindnet'' increased based upon the number of subjects, with one minute being needed per two subjects.\n\nAnyone linked via a ''mindnet'' gained the mental fortitude, with regards to resisting [[magic]] and similar situations, as the subject with the highest intelligence. Participants could also pool their spells, allowing other subjects to cast spells from their memory with their consent as long as the subject borrowing the spell would be able to cast it under normal circumstances. The casting priest could ''[[teleport]]'' any subject to the location of another twice every ten minutes. The ''mindnet'' would be broken the instant the casting priest stopped concentration on the spell.",
        "Components": "This spell did not require [[spell component]]s of any kind to cast.",
        "History": "''Mindnet'' was commonly used by members of the [[Church of Vhaeraun]]."
