        "mainbody": "'''Steelstar-space''' was a remote [[crystal sphere]] located far from the known spaceways.\n\nThe sphere contained the eponymous Steel Star, a fire world with a distinctive grey coloration. Orbiting this planet was the last [[ogre]] [[mammoth (spelljammer)|kingship]], home to the space-going ogres that survived the [[First Unhuman War]]. Surrounding the kingship were numerous smaller ships that had been scavenged or stolen by the ogres, who were slowly rebuilding the fleet and building two new kingships as they began to send forth raiders.\n\nMany thought such tales to be little more than rumors, but [[Khelben Arunsun]] had confirmed that the Steel Star and the kingship did exist, and warned the elves that if the other two kingships were ever finished, there would be a great war."
