'''''Sprites''''' was an [[elven]] [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the school of [[conjuration]] that summoned a group of [[sprite]]s.

==Effects==
When cast this spell instantly summoned 2â€“20 sprites. It remained unclear where the sprites were summoned from, as the sprite community swore they were not [[teleport]]ed away from their homes. Many believed the sprites were the spirits of sprite warriors who perished while serving the elves in the past.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required as [[material component]]s a piece of sprite clothing and a small [[silver]] [[bell]] to cast.

==History==
The origins of this spell resulted from an ancient pact made between elves and sprites.
