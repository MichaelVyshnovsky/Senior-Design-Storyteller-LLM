        "Effects": "Casting this cantrip produced one of two different creaking noises as chosen by the [[somatic]] gesture. The range of the spell was {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. The rusty-hinged door sound lasted two seconds, as if a door was slowly opened. The squeaky floor sound originated within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the caster, lasted for three seconds, and appeared to the listener as if someone was walking on a floor with loose boards in a direction chosen by the caster.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and somatic components to cast. Verbally, the caster made a quiet creaking sound. For the sound of an opening door, the gesture started with a thumb touching the fingertips and then opening the hand. For the squeaky floor sound, the gesture was \"walking\" with two fingers as if they were legs."
