        "mainbody": "'''''Blast of pain''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine spell]] that inflicted a sharp pain into the target.",
        "Users": "The spell could be cast by [[cleric]]s who commanded the [[combat sphere|combat]] and [[Necromantic sphere|necromantic]] spheres. It was commonly used priests of [[Ilmater]].",
        "Effect": "As its name suggested, the ''blast of pain'' spell inflicted intense pain on its victim, via a ray of smoky grey light shot from caster to the target. A creature that succumbed to the pain was left writhing in agony for some time, their nervous system damaged, incapable of action or coherent thought, and senseless to goings-on around them. One who resisted was merely slowed both mentally and physically, and harmed less, before the spell passed.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast."
