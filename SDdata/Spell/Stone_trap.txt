'''''Stone trap''''' allowed a caster to suspend a block of stone as well as set the conditions in which it would fall to the ground, damaging anyone underneath. This spell was highly customizable and could be used in a variety of manners.

==Effects==
When casting this spell, the [[magic]]-user would specify the height at which the stone would hover, after which it would turn invisible. This stone could hold up additional weight or materials, as long s its size would naturally allow it to do so, or could even act as the keystone in an archway or as a stopgap for a hole in the ceiling. A ''stone trap'' that was spring with an additional weight on top could be extremely deadly.

The conditions for causing the stone trap to spring could be as simple or elaborate as the caster wished, as long as they were based on actions or specific qualities. Anything from a creature's proximity, their alignment, race or size could be specified as a trigger for the ''stone trap''.

==Components==
The material component for this spell was a small pebble and a single drop of blood. Though some sources stated that a tear or drop of water could be used in place of the latter component.

==Usage==
High-ranking [[dwarven]] [[priest]]s of [[Vergadain]] were typically known to have this spell bestowed upon them.
