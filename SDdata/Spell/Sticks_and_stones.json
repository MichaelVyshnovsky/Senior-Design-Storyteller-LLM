        "mainbody": "Sticks and stones was a necromancy spell that would animate a pile of natural debris into a skeleton-like creation. The caster would designate a pile of wooden rubbish, just as rocks, sticks or tree limbs, and they would animate together into a crude, humanoid construct. \nThis being would immediately attack whomever the caster designated. It had no intelligence beyond this but was capable of draining energy like a wight."
