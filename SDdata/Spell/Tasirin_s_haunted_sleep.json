        "mainbody": "Tasirins haunted sleep was an arcane enchantment spell that put a target into a supernatural deep sleep.\nOnce this spell was cast upon the target, and short of the caster ending the spell, only a wish, limited wish, or successful dispel magic could rouse the target from their slumber. The spell could only be used on a target that was already asleep. The target was susceptible from suggestions received in their dreams as visions designed by the caster. Upon their waking they felt a strong compulsion to comply with the suggestion.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThis spell was found within the Treatise of Sublimated Oneiromancy."
