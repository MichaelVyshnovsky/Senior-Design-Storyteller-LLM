Shadow bolt, known also as shadow burst, was an evocation spell used by wizards.
This spell created a burst of gray shadow force that the caster shot from their hands toward a target. The shadow bolt never missed if the caster could see the target when the spell was cast. A target struck by the bolt experienced wracking pain, making it more difficult for them to perform normal functions.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
