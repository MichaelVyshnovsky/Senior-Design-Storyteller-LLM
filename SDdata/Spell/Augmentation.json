        "mainbody": "The augmentation group of spells were evocation spells used by wizards.\nThese spells were used to increase the physical harm caused by beginner to intermediate spells. Each casting would only affect a single spell cast within one minute for augmentation I, but augmentation II affected the next five spells cast. If more than a minute passed and the follow-up spell was not cast then the augmentation spell was wasted.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, augmentation I required a pair of concentric circles made of either bronze or silver to cast. For augmentation II the concentric circles needed to be made of gold or platinum."
