Seal path was an abjuration spell that closed off further development of a path of magic the victim followed.
This spell permanently prevented a wizard from learning any new spells within a specific path of power or school of magic designated by the caster. In some cases, seal path was so effective that it added the effect of the close path spell on the victim. It was, however, not without risks if the target withstood the magic, it could be reflected on the caster.
The effect of seal path was permanent, and could only be removed with a limited wish, wish, or by casting the reversed form, open path.
In addition to using verbal and somatic components, both seal path and its reversed form required a specially crafted seal of polished metal. It had to be made from alloyed mithral and lead, engraved with the victims name or sigil. It had a material worth of at least 1000 gp.
Seal path, together with the spells close path and burn path, formed the rarely found Path of Paths, dreaded by followers of path magic as it directly attacked their spellcasting ability.
