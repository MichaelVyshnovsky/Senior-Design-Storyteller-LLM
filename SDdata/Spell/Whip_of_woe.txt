'''''Whip of woe''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that manifested a spectral [[whip]], made up of pure force energy.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, it created a [[magic]]al ''whip'' that could be wielded by the spell's caster or left to float independently in the air. When the ''whip'' struck a person or creature it left them weak and vulnerable to future attacks.

While the whip lashed out at any targets, the casting [[cleric]] was unable to attack or cast spells on their own.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic components]], this spell required a single hair taken from a [[human]], which had been anointed with [[holy water]] upon a shrine of [[Beshaba]].

==History==
The specifications of this spell were found in ''[[the Black Book]]''.
