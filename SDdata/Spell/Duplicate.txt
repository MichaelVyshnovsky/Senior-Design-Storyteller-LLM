Duplicate was a divine alteration and evocation spell used by priests devoted to Oghma, enabling them to copy written inscriptions.
This spell created a magical quill that appeared in midair. The quill would copy any writing or inscription of the casters choosing onto a suitable writing surface. This spell was useful for copying other spells and scrolls. The quill would not trigger any magical traps or runes present, but would transfer the same traps onto the newly copied item. The copied writing would appear identical to the original, making this spell useful for forgeries as well.
The caster could only manage one duplicate at a time and attempting to copy more inscriptions would result in feeblemindedness and the loss of the casters mental acuity to the point where they could actually die. Casters who perished in this manner lost all spellcasting abilities if raised or resurrected.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a feather to cast.
