        "mainbody": "Detect disease was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, the spell gave a shugenja vague knowledge on the balance of forces in an area. Forces such as chaotic, evil, good or lawful were detectable. The spell did not reveal the alignment of any creature or item in the area of effect of the spell. If the spell was cast directly on a creature, the spell revealed vague information about their alignment and past deeds. The spell could also be cast on a building, which revealed whether the building was a holy place or occupied by spirits.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a scroll of sutras. This scroll had to cost at least 5 chien."
