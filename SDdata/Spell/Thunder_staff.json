        "mainbody": "Thunder staff was an evocation spell used by wizards.\nThis spell allowed the caster to rap the ground with their staff, creating a thundering cone of force capable of stunning and deafening any creature caught in its path. The force was also able to throw creatures through the air. The caster could also use this spell to blast open locked doors or other barriers.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a vial of rain collected during a thunderstorm and the wizards staff to cast. The staff needed to be made of oak."
