Trance was a common spell used by shugenja in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.
A shugenja used this spell to enter a deep trance. During this trance, they could not move or speak. By using this spell, a shugenja became deeply attuned to the forces and powers of an area, which allowed them to detect the presence of anything magical or supernatural and their effect on the area. They could detect lesser or greater spirits, curses, and haunting. Through this spell the shugenja could determine the general type of spirit(s) which inhabited the area. This spell did not facilitate communicating with any detected spirits.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
