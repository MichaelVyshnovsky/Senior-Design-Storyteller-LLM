        "mainbody": "'''''Windrider''''' was a spell unique to [[Maztica]].",
        "Effects": "This spell allowed a caster to move an object on air or water. As this spell did not provide levitation to an object, an airborne object had to be held up by a force of its own. This spell was able to move objects on which the spells ''[[Elevate I]]'' or ''[[Elevate II]]'' were cast on. For the spell to function, the caster had to remain within 10 feet (3 meters) of the object. This distance increased as the caster grew more powerful. A caster could move an object up to 120 feet (36.5 meters) a day. The spell was vulnerable to weather conditions such as strong winds.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]]: a piece of a feather from a [[vulture]]."
