Sunburst was an arcane evocation and divine spell that blinded and damaged nearby enemies.
There were a few different versions of this spell that developed over time. The earliest version was centered on the caster, and indeed the radiance was emitted from the casters person out to a minimum radius of 160 ft (49 m) even farther for more experienced casters. Later versions could be cast at a point far away and burst with a fixed size. The pre-Spellplague version had a range of at least 1,000 ft (305 m) and an 80 ft (24 m) radius of effect. The post-Second Sundering version could only be cast out to 150 ft (46 m) and burst in a 60 ft (18 m) radius.
Sunburst caused a globe of searing heat and radiance to explode instantly and silently from the caster or the targeted point. All creatures in the globe had a chance to be blinded and damaged by the heat. Creatures that could see in darkness, or to whom sunlight was harmful (such as vampires) or unnatural (such as drow) were affected more severely. Undead creatures caught within the globe also suffered greater effects, sometimes resulting in the complete destruction of undead creatures susceptible to sunlight. The ultraviolet light generated by the spell also damaged fungi, mold, oozes, slimes, jellies, puddings, and fungoid creatures just as if they were undead creatures.
The later versions of this spell also dispelled any magical darkness within the area of effect.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a piece of sunstone and an open, unshielded flame to cast.
This spell appeared in a diary by an unknown mage believed to have lived in the mid-13th century DR. The book was given the name Against the Undead by one of its readers. Sometime after it was discovered it was published in Volos Guide to All Things Magical and became generally known, but it was uncommon to find it.
