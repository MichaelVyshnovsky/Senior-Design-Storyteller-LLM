Within this area, the air became painful to breathe and anyone wearing metal armor felt effects similar to the spell heat metal.\nThis spell came into use as a means to heat and cook food, often being cast in large brick ovens or smoking chambers. It was re-appropriated as a means to keep away would-be thieves or way to create a comfortable lair for fire-attuned pets.\nCategoryEvocation spells\nCategoryDarssons spells\nCategorySorcerer spells\nCategoryWizard spells\nsh66wwmo62ersfb0is74uq652sbyr1z"
