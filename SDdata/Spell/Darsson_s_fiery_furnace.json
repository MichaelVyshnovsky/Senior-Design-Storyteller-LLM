        "mainbody": "'''''Darsson's fiery furnace''''' was an [[arcane]] spell that raised the temperature of an area determined by the caster to extremely hot levels. Within this area, the air became painful to breathe and anyone wearing metal armor felt effects similar to the spell ''[[heat metal]]''.",
        "Development": "This spell came into use as a means to heat and cook food, often being cast in large brick ovens or smoking chambers. It was re-appropriated as a means to keep away would-be thieves or way to create a comfortable lair for fire-attuned pets.",
