        "mainbody": "'''''Gemidan's paralytic missile''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a projectile of energy that ''[[paralyze]]d'' any person or creature it struck. It was developed by the [[wizard]] [[Gemidan]], after a casting of ''[[magic missile]]'' failed.",
        "Effects": "When cast, a green bolt of pure [[magic]]al energy shot forth from the tip of the caster's finger. It streaked towards its intended target and always struck true, provided at least part of their body was visible to the caster. The effective range of this spell was well over 120' (36.6 m).\n\nWhen a person or creature was struck by a ''paralytic missile'', they were immobilized for a number of seconds, or longer depending on the skill and experience of the caster.",
        "History": "After Gemidan inadvertently discovered the particulars of this spell, her master, [[Khelben Arunsun]], gave the specifications of its casting to the [[Mage Civilar]] of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]], [[Thyriellentha Snome]]. She then proceeded to make the spell available to other watchmen along with [[mage]]s of the city's [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]].",
        "Components": "This spell only required the use of [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
