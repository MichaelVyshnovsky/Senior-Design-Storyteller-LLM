        "mainbody": "Gemidans paralytic missile was an evocation spell that created a projectile of energy that paralyzed any person or creature it struck. It was developed by the wizard Gemidan, after a casting of magic missile failed. \nWhen cast, a green bolt of pure magical energy shot forth from the tip of the casters finger. It streaked towards its intended target and always struck true, provided at least part of their body was visible to the caster. The effective range of this spell was well over 120 (36.6 m).\nWhen a person or creature was struck by a paralytic missile, they were immobilized for a number of seconds, or longer depending on the skill and experience of the caster.\nAfter Gemidan inadvertently discovered the particulars of this spell, her master, Khelben Arunsun, gave the specifications of its casting to the Mage Civilar of the City Watch, Thyriellentha Snome. She then proceeded to make the spell available to other watchmen along with mages of the citys Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors.\nThis spell only required the use of verbal and somatic components."
