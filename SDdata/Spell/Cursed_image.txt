'''''Cursed image''''' was a spell unique to [[Maztica]].

==Effects==
A caster used this spell to inflict damage on a targeted individual from a distance. A caster manipulated a clay likeness of the targeted individual to either cause painful damage or immobilize the target. Punching or stabbing the likeness transmitted damage, while holding it firmly immobilized the target. The caster was unable to do both at the same time.

==Casting==
Casting the spell was an involved process. The caster had to mould the likeness from clay themselves. They needed to be aware of the general location and appearance of the targeted individual.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], some clay. If the caster incorporated some of the target's hair or nail clippings, the spell had an even stronger effect on the target.
