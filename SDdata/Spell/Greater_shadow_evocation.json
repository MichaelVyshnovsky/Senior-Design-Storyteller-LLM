        "mainbody": "'''''Greater shadow evocation''''', also known as '''''demi-shadow magic''''' (or '''''demishadow magic''''') and '''''Shadow's demimagic''''', was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] that created semi-real duplicates of [[Arcane magic|arcane]] [[evocation]] spells. It was a superior version of the ''[[shadow evocation]]'' spell.",
        "Effects": "The spell enabled the caster to tap into the [[shadow magic|energies]] of the [[Plane of Shadow]] to create shadowy imitations of powerful spells such as ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[wall of fire]]'', ''[[wall of ice]]'', ''[[cloudkill]]'', and the like.\n\nIf a target recognized an offensive spell to be an illusion, that spell lost much of its potency.",
        "Components": "The spell used [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s only.",
        "History": "The spell was originally devised by the [[Netheril|Netherese]] [[Netherese arcanist|arcanist]] known as [[Telamont Tanthul|Shadow]] in [[-587 DR|3272 NY (âˆ’587 DR)]], and was originally called ''Shadow's demimagic''. This was simplified to ''demishadow magic'' by the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], It ultimately came to be known as ''greater shadow evocation''.\n\nThe spell was a favorite of [[cloaker lord]]s."
