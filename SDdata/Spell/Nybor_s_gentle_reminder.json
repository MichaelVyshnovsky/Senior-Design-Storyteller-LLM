        "mainbody": "Nybors gentle reminder was an enchantment spell that inflicted an agonizing pain upon its target, without causing physical harm.\nWhen struck by gentle reminder, a subject was immobilized with sharp and tremendous pain that ran through their body. Their body was constrained but otherwise undamaged.\nThis spell was originally used by slavers, overseers and others who administered over subjugates. However by 1372 DR, the Red Wizards of Thay regularly employed it in combat situations.\nThe earlier version of gentle reminder only had a verbal component,"
