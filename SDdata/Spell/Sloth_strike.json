        "mainbody": "Sloth strike is a transmutation spell used by several swordmages of relatively low experience and power. When sloth strike is cast it infuses the flesh of a creature struck by a swordmages weapon in melee with icy power, partially freezing their muscles and blood. In addition to causing the target great pain, this slows their movements for a brief moment. Sloth strike can be recharged after a short rest of a few minutes, at which point it can be cast again.\nCategoryTransmutation spells\nCategorySwordmage spells\nef4f35aw2gkwx55icdms79kysihodut"
