'''''Beltyn's burning blood''''' was a [[necromancy]] spell that caused blood flowing out of open wounds to become corrosive.''Dreams of the Red Wizards'' refers to this spell as "Belten's burning blood". ''Spell Compendium'' simply calls it "burning blood". 

==Effects==
The target of this spell was one creature that had open, bleeding wounds caused by an edged weapon or similar means (wounds from blunt weapons or those that had been dressed or healed did not produce enough blood). Alternatively, after the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the target could be uninjured, but the caster supplied the blood. The range of this spell was 10 yards (9.1 meters) per the caster's level or {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}} or more, and it did not require line of sight to the target. The target had to have blood ([[undead]], [[elemental]]s, [[Plant creature|plants]], [[ooze]]s, ''etc.'' were immune) and not be impervious to fire. The exposed blood was subtly and temporarily changed to become hot and corrosive to surrounding tissue. The burning lasted for some time, but the victim had several chances to resist before it ended.

''Beltyn's burning blood'' could not be cast into the [[ethereal plane]] from the [[Prime Material Plane]], but creatures that changed shape to hide wounds, or that melded with objects, such as trees or stones, could still be the target of this spell and suffer its effects.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a pinch of [[saltpeter]] and blood, which could be that of a creature with open, bleeding wounds within range which they put the blood in their mouth and spat as they uttered the words of the spell.

==History==
The spell was created by, or at least attributed to, the early [[mage]] [[Beltyn]]. It was included in the ''[[Book of Bats]]'' some time before the mid–12{{th}} century [[DR]].While a date is unknown, the chronology of the ''Book of Bats'' suggests Beltyn was alive a long time before the mid–12{{th}} century DR.

This spell was published in "[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]" and became generally known to the magical community, albeit still rare, by [[1358 DR]].

==Usage==
The spell was available to [[cleric]]s of [[Karsus]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/104/Forgotten Deities: Karsus|4}}
