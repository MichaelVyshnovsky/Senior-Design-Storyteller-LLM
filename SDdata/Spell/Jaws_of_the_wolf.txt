Jaws of the wolf was a divine evocation spell that conjured forth the spectral maw of a wolf that assaulted its target.
When cast, this spell manifested a set of fanged jaws, about the width of a human head, that streaked unerringly towards a targeted individual. When it struck, the jaws of the wolf bit the target and drained them of their life force before fading away.
Druids used a slightly different version of this spell. Instead of jaws, their version of the spell manifested a whole wolf. The amount of wolves manifested was determined by their skill level.
The specifications of this spell were inscribed within the relic known as the Leaves of Green.
In order to be cast, this spell required verbal and somatic components along with four teeth taken from a wolf. When cast by a druid, they required a focus, a carving of a wolf, one for each manifested.
