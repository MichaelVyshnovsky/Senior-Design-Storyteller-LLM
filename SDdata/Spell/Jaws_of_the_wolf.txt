'''''Jaws of the wolf''''' was a [[divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] that conjured forth the spectral maw of a [[wolf]] that assaulted its target.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell manifested a set of fanged jaws, about the width of a [[human]] head, that streaked unerringly towards a targeted individual. When it struck, the ''jaws of the wolf'' bit the target and [[energy drain|drained them]] of their life force before fading away.

[[Druid]]s used a slightly different version of this spell. Instead of jaws, their version of the spell manifested a whole wolf. The amount of wolves manifested was determined by their skill level.

==History==
The specifications of this spell were inscribed within the [[relic]] known as the ''[[Leaves of Green]]''.

==Components==
In order to be cast, this spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s along with four teeth taken from a wolf. When cast by a druid, they required a [[focus]], a carving of a wolf, one for each manifested.
