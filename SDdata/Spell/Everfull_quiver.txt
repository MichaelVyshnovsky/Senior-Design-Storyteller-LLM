'''''Everfull quiver''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Solonor Thelandira]].
 
==Effects==
This spell was used to enchant a [[quiver]] containing at least two [[arrow]]s. Once cast, the quiver provided a steady of supply of arrows for the caster. However, the caster could only withdraw two arrows at a time. If more than two arrows were withdrawn, the spell was broken and the enchantment lifted. The spell's effect only functioned for the caster, if another individual removed an arrow, the spell ended. Other than the original arrows in the quiver at the time of casting, the fired arrows faded out of existence after a short period.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the holy symbol of Solonor Thelandira and at least two arrows, which were consumed by the spell.
