Everfull quiver was a spell used by clerics of Solonor Thelandira.
This spell was used to enchant a quiver containing at least two arrows. Once cast, the quiver provided a steady of supply of arrows for the caster. However, the caster could only withdraw two arrows at a time. If more than two arrows were withdrawn, the spell was broken and the enchantment lifted. The spells effect only functioned for the caster, if another individual removed an arrow, the spell ended. Other than the original arrows in the quiver at the time of casting, the fired arrows faded out of existence after a short period.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required material components, the holy symbol of Solonor Thelandira and at least two arrows, which were consumed by the spell.
