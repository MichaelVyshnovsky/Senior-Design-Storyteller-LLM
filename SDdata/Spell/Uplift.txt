'''''Uplift''''' was a cooperative [[spell]] that allowed a [[priest]] to boost the spellcasting ability of another.

==Effects==
Both priests had to be able to cast this spell, which took 12 hours to complete. At the end of this long ritual, the more powerful priest was granted greater [[divine magic]] temporarily, allowing them to receive and cast extra spells.

During the casting of ''uplift'', the priests decided which new spells they desired and supplicated their [[deity]] or deities for them. Upon successful completion of this spell, the priests touched palms and the superior priest immediately gained the additional spells and had 10 minutes in which to cast them. At the end of this time, the priest that received the ''uplift'' became mentally exhausted and required eight hours of bedrest.

==Components==
The only [[somatic component]] of this spell was the touching of palms at the very end. [[Verbal component]]s included naming the bonus spell or spells desired. The [[material component]]s were the priests' [[holy symbol]]s and an offering from each priest worth at least 500 [[gold piece]]s.

==Notable Users==
[[Circle singer]]s, the [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Angharradh]], were capable of casting this spell once per [[tenday]].<ref>
