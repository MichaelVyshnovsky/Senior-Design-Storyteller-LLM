Evolve was a powerful arcane necromancy spell that forced an animal to permanently change into an intelligent humanoid.
The target of this spell was loyal to the caster, allowing the caster to create a veritable army of servants with enough patience. This spell only functioned on normal animals. The transformation caused the animal to grow or shrink to human size and shape. Normal intelligence and the ability to speak developed as well. The new creature could have special non-magical abilities based upon their abilities as an animal. For example, a spider might end up having a venomous bite in their evolved state.
The evolution process took a full day to complete once the spell was cast. Only a wish or divine intervention could reverse the process.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a subject animal, a bit of organic material from the caster, a pearl worth at least 500 gp, and a miniature tool to cast. All of the components were consumed during the casting.
This spell was included in Kyristans Mysteries.
