        "mainbody": "A '''''scorching burst''''' is an [[evocation school|evocation]] [[spell]] cast by many [[wizard]]s inflamed with the power of fire. When a wizard chooses to cast this spell, which he can do at any time, he creates a pillar of golden flame at the spot of his target, trapping his target and any others very close within its grasp. The burst must be cast within fifty feet of the wizard and disappears in an instant, but can be recast at any time. ''Scorching burst'' is twice as deadly if cast by an [[archmage]] or mage of equivalent power.",
