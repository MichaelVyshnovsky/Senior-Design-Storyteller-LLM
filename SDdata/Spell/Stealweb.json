        "mainbody": "Stealweb was an alteration and evocation wizard spell. This spell was derived from an ancient Netherese spell long since forgotten.\nThis spell was used on portals such as door frames, archways or windows. It could also be used on crude openings such as the space between two large rocks. When cast on such portals the spell lay waiting until triggered, giving off a faint hint of magic. The caster of this spell could not be harmed by its magic. The caster determined specific trigger conditions that would release the spells energy during the time of casting.\nWhen triggered, stealweb released a bright web of white lines that washed over the victim and then vanished. Only a single victim could be targeted by the spell per instance, but the spell could be triggered more depending on the skill of the caster.\nThe victim suffered initial harm from the web of lines that touched them but could only be harmed once in this manner from the spell. Furthermore, if after being harmed in this way, the victim crossed through the portal while the same stealweb was active, they would not suffer additional harm from the magical energy.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a piece of phosphorous, a flint and a piece of cobweb to cast."
