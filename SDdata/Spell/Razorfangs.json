        "mainbody": "Razorfangs was a spell that could only be cast by dragons.\nThis spell was an improved version of the sharptooth spell. When cast, this allowed a dragon to alter their teeth to make them incredibly hard, sharp and strong. It was cast before battle or when a dragon was trying to eat a rather hard-to-chew meal, like a knight. \nThis spell required only a verbal component."
