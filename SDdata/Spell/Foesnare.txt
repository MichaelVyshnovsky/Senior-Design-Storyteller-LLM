Foesnare is a basic evocation spell used by some swordmages early in their training. When foesnare is cast it causes bolts of solid, eldritch energy to burst from the body of a creature struck with the swordmages weapon. These bolts, grasping to the body of their victim, tie into the ground beneath, holding the creature still for a brief moment, in addition to wounding the victim with power proportionate to the swordmages mental processing power. Foesnare, while easy to learn, is straining on its caster and a swordmage must rest at least a few minutes before casting the spell again.
