The tongue, angelica plant, mustard, foxtail, turnip and ear were shredded and added to the mixture as it heated, in their respective order until it boiled over. The sepia was warmed over a flame, to which was added the residue of the boiling concoction. It was kept on the flame for another hour and stirred constantly. After the hour it was cooled and left in a [[vial]] for a full day."
