        "mainbody": "Salt was a useful cantrip that neophyte wizards could learn. It conjured a sprinkling of finely ground salt above a target creature or object.\nThis cantrip produced an amount of salt sufficient to preserve a barrel of fish, flavor a large kettle of stew, or treat a small plot of ground for weed prevention. In practical terms, it was enough to apply to about  of foodstuffs or  of turf. Smaller targets could easily become over-salted without proper application of this spell, and larger objects might receive an insufficient amount for the desired effect. Giant slugs and other creatures susceptible to contact with salt could be slightly injured by a clever application of this cantrip. The caster could target an object or creature within .\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster made a sprinkling gesture with one hand while making a smacking noise with their lips."
