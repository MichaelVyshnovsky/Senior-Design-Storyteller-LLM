        "Effects": "This cantrip produced an amount of [[salt]] sufficient to preserve a barrel of [[fish]], flavor a large kettle of stew, or treat a small plot of ground for weed prevention. In practical terms, it was enough to apply to about {{SI|30|gal|L|long=yes}} of foodstuffs or {{SI|4|sq yd|long=yes}} of turf. Smaller targets could easily become over-salted without proper application of this spell, and larger objects might receive an insufficient amount for the desired effect. [[Giant slug]]s and other creatures susceptible to contact with salt could be slightly injured by a clever application of this cantrip. The caster could target an object or creature within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}.",
        "Components": "This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster made a sprinkling gesture with one hand while making a smacking noise with their lips."
