        "mainbody": "'''''Fist of the adder''''' was a potent offensive [[spell]] used in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. This spell was favored by the [[Red Eyes]] sorcerous society.",
        "Effects": "This spell caused the caster's arm to change into a long tentacle tipped with the head of an adder. The attack range of the arm was quite long depending on the power of the caster. The adder struck with deadly accuracy and could even harm creatures that were only harmed by magical weapons. Casters with more power were able to strike with more force, causing devastating physical damage. For more powerful wizards, attacks by the adder were also complimented with venom.",
        "Components": "This spell required the skin of a venomous snake to cast."
