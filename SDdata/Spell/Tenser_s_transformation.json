        "mainbody": "| reversible1e  =\n| school1e      =\n| level1e       =\n| type1e        =\nTensers transformation () was a spell that made the caster a virtual fighting machine&mdashimproving the casters strength, dexterity, and physical constitution, as well as increasing the natural thickness of his or her skin. While granting those physical advantages, it prevented spellcasting and the ability to use any magical devices.\nTo Zakharan mages, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as transformation, and counted among the spells of the universal province.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic and material components. The material required was some hair from a bull."
