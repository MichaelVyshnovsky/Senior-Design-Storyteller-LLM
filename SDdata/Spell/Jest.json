        "mainbody": "Jest was a common spell used by geisha. The spell was extremely rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThis spell was very similar to the fascinate spell. When a creature heard the geisha casting the spell, they ceased what they were doing and became transfixed. If a creature was attacked before the spell was cast, the effect was broken. After the spell was cast, a transfixed creature burst into uncontrollable and debilitating laughter. Some creatures were able to withstand the spell and were not affected.\nThe spell required only a verbal component."
