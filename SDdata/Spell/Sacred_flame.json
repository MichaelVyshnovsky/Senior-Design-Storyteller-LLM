        "mainbody": "'''''Sacred flame''''' was a basic [[prayer]] in the post-[[Spellplague]] era, turned [[divine magic|divine]] [[cantrip]] following the [[Second Sundering]], that was similar (though not identical) to the spell ''[[lance of faith]]''. It was cast by [[cleric]]s, primarily [[Cleric#Devoted Cleric|devoted cleric]]s.",
        "Effects": "When ''sacred flame'' was cast the cleric invoked divine power, casting a beam of light from the heavens into the flesh of a creature within {{SI|25|ft|long=yes}}twenty-five feet, injuring them to a degree largely dependent on how focused and perceptive the caster was. The resulting blast allowed the cleric to grant a boost in courage and health to one ally within their sight. Being one of the most basic prayers during the post-Spellplague era, ''sacred flame'' could be cast at will."
