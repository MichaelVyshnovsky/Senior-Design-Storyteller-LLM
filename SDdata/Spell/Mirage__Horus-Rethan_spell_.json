        "mainbody": "Mirage was a divine illusion spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Horus-Re called Sunhawks.\nThis spell caused all targets within a  cube to see a tantalizing mirage on the horizon to was difficult to resist. The caster picked the form the mirage would take, and it would always stay out of reach of the targets. The targets did not need to be facing the direction of the mirage for it to grab their attention as it would flicker on the periphery of their vision if they were looking elsewhere.\nThe mirage could be ended by a dispel magic spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component the Sunhawks holy symbol and a few drops of water flicked into the air to cast."
