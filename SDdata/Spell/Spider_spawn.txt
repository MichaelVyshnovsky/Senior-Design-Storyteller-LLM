Spider spawn was a conjuration spell that could summon one or two spiders. The summoned arachnids would comply with the commands of the spellcaster via a telepathic link.
The wizard was able to cast the spell by throwing several conjured spider eggs into the air. If uninterrupted, the eggs would magically transform into a spider, or two spiders (but this only had a one in five chance). The type of spider summoned was dependent on the power of the caster, with novice mages only being able to summon giant spiders, but more experienced casters were able to summon phase spiders, or even sword spiders.
