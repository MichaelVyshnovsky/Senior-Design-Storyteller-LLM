'''''Spider spawn''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that could summon one or two [[spider]]s. The summoned arachnids would comply with the commands of the spellcaster via a [[telepathic]] link.

==Effects==
The [[wizard]] was able to cast the spell by throwing several conjured spider eggs into the air. If uninterrupted, the eggs would [[magic]]ally transform into a spider, or two spiders (but this only had a one in five chance). The type of spider summoned was dependent on the power of the caster, with novice mages only being able to summon [[giant spider]]s, but more experienced casters were able to summon [[phase spider]]s, or even [[sword spider]]s.
