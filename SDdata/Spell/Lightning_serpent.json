        "mainbody": "'''''Lightning serpent''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]], during the period between the [[Spellplague]] and [[Second Sundering]], that unleashed a [[serpent]]-shaped bolt of lightning.",
        "Effects": "When cast ''lightning serpent'' caused a bolt of lightning to crackle from the spellcaster's hand, that took take on a serpentine appearance as it flew towards the single target of choice. In addition to electrical damage, the target would become [[poison]]ed and their movements would become slowed down.\n\nThe spell's effectiveness could be enhanced by the use of [[implement]]s."
