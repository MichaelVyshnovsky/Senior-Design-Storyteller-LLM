        "mainbody": "'''''Wall of paper''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell created a wall of [[paper]] and thin wood supports, similar to the interior walls found in residences throughout Kara-Tur. The wall automatically attached itself to connecting surfaces. The wu jen had the option to make the wall fixed or a sliding screen. It remained permanently in place until damaged, destroyed or dispelled and had the strength of a regular paper wall. If the wall was damaged, a wu jen could cast a ''[[mend]]'' spell to repair it. A unique property of ''wall of paper'' was that it retained [[illusion]]s cast upon it, such as a ''[[phantasmal force]]'' spell. The illusion was broken when the paper wall was physically touched by a creature.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a small origami folded into a sliding joint."
