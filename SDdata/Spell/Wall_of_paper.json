        "mainbody": "Wall of paper was a common spell used by wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nWhen cast, this spell created a wall of paper and thin wood supports, similar to the interior walls found in residences throughout Kara-Tur. The wall automatically attached itself to connecting surfaces. The wu jen had the option to make the wall fixed or a sliding screen. It remained permanently in place until damaged, destroyed or dispelled and had the strength of a regular paper wall. If the wall was damaged, a wu jen could cast a mend spell to repair it. A unique property of wall of paper was that it retained illusions cast upon it, such as a phantasmal force spell. The illusion was broken when the paper wall was physically touched by a creature.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, a small origami folded into a sliding joint."
