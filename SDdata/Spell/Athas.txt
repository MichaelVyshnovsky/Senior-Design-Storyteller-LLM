'''Athas''' was a desert planet located in a [[crystal sphere]] that was cut off from the rest of the [[Prime Material plane]]. Travel to and from the sphere was impossible by physical means and extremely difficult even by [[magic]].

==Cosmology==
The crystal sphere that contained Athas was not connected to any of the usual [[spelljamming]] routes out of [[Realmspace]], [[Krynnspace]], or [[Greyspace]]. Its location in the [[phlogiston]] was not documented in any book or chart. Some speculated that the crystal sphere was simply too distant from known space, so much so that traveling there would take several lifetimes.

The world's inaccessibility was the result of a property of its crystal sphere that rendered it impenetrable to [[spelljammer]]s and almost completely cut off from other planes. The border of the [[Ethereal plane]] within the sphere was replaced by an environment known as "the Gray", which caused anyone in it to become lost and slowly weaken. It was extremely difficult to overcome by planar travel even by powerful [[spell]]s such as ''[[teleport without error]]'' and ''[[plane shift]]'', which had a risk of sending the caster into the Gray instead of the intended destination. Even the ''[[contact other plane]]'' spell had a chance of pulling the caster into the Gray.

One of the few ways of accessing Athas was through [[Baba Yaga]]'s [[Baba Yaga's Hut|dancing hut]], which traveled all the worlds and planes. In its Hall of Gateways, a portal called the World Gate linked to every world Baba Yaga knew of, including Athas, as well as their respective [[Shadowfell]]s and [[Feywild]]s. This was guarded by a pair of oath wights from Athas, who believed they were defending their world from trespassers.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/196/Baba Yaga's Dancing Hut|52}} Another means of achieving this was the powerful planeshifting fortress known as [[Planar Sphere|The Planar Sphere]], which had one room that became occupied by a group of [[Athasian halfling]]s after visiting the desert world.<ref> Thirdly, the multidimensional [[World Serpent Inn]] had among its hallways full of ''portals'' a door that opened into Athas, though it was kept under lock and key.{{Cite dragon/351/Athas and the World Serpent Inn|32}}

==Geography==
The majority of Athas was a desert, with most civilization concentrated in a {{SIAdj|1000000|sq mi|k|long=yes}} area known as the [[w:c:darksun:Tablelands|Tablelands]].{{Cite dragon/319/Dark Sun: Player's Handbook|25}} Beyond nomadic tribes and villages, most of the Athasian races lived within one of seven city-states. Six of these city-states were ruled by tyrants known as the [[w:c:darksun:Sorcerer-Kings|Sorcerer-Kings]], powerful [[arcane spellcaster]]s the Tablelands were boarded from the east by the [[w:c:darksun:Sea of Silt|Sea of Silt]], a great ocean of [[sand]] and silt

==History==
When [[Factol]] Mallin of the [[Mercykillers]] died, his successor Alisohn Nilesi requested of the [[Dustmen]] that his body be buried on Athas.<ref>

In The Year of Despair, Malatran calendar, late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent from the [[Malatran Plateau]] through an elemental ''[[portal|gate]]'' to the far-away world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by [[Athasian elf]] slavers. They eventually managed to escape alongside a young [[Athasian thri-kreen]] named [[Ka'cha]] when a sink worm attacked the caravan. They went on to return the thri-kreen to his tribe, the [[Windrunners]], then at their instruction traveled to the [[Ringing Forest]] for a way back to Toril.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns}}

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a [[book]] on the history of Athas was part of the collection of the [[arcanaloth]] headmaster of the [[Dweomercore]] level of [[Undermountain]]. The library-fortress [[Candlekeep]] also had tomes of lore on Athas, but they were few in number and kept within hidden rooms one had to use ward tokens to ''[[teleport]]'' into.<ref>{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-25/Candlekeep's lore on other worlds}}
