Sparkling sword was a spell used by clerics of Arvoreen.
When cast, this casters melee weapon, often a sword, began to glow with a sparkling silvery light. The spell increased the damage inflicted by the sword. When the spell expired, the sword was usually ruined. A stronger version of this spell was called blazing sword.
