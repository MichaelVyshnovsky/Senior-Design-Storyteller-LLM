        "mainbody": "Windlance was a divine magic spell available to clerics, specialty priests, and druids that served one of the deities that were revered by the Emerald Enclave and possibly others, such as followers of Gwaeron Windstrom.\nThis spell was typically used as a means of escape for spellcasters that could shapechange into a form that could fly. When invoked, the caster and any creatures in a  square around the caster were catapulted straight up into the air by a burst of wind. The height was chosen by the caster and could be any distance from  to . Windlance worked in concert with the shapechanging ability of the caster, allowing them to cast the spell and change shape nearly simultaneously. Other creatures blown into the air somehow had to prevent their subsequent fall or suffer the consequences.\nThis spell only required a verbal component to cast."
