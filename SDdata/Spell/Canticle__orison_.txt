'''''Canticle''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[orison]].
 
==Effects==
This spell was a minor version of ''[[sanctuary]]''. While the caster chanted recitations from this clergy's sacred texts, the spell protected the caster from attack until the spell expired. The spell limited the activity of the caster and they were only capable of moving very slowly.
