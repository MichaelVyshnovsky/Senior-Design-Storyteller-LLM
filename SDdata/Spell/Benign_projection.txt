Benign projection was a type of sanctified spell.
This spell was almost identical to the project image spell but with some key differences. The projected image could only cast spells from specific schools of magic abjuration, conjuration and divination.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a divine focus and a sacrifice of the casters strength.
