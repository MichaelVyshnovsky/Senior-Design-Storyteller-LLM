Curse of the Revenancer was a divine magic spell granted to priestesses of Kiaransalee, the Lady of the Dead, also known as the Revenancer. It caused the target creature to be haunted by the spirits of those they subsequently killed.
The priestess had to touch the intended target of the spell either during casting or within three minutes of completion. The victim had to be a living creatureâ€”the spell had no effect on the undead. The target creature had one chance to resist the magic of this spell or be permanently cursed. The only way to remove curse of the Revenancer was by a wish spell or a remove curse cast by an extremely puissant individual. After being cursed, any humanoid killed by the victim had a small chance to come back as a revenant and zealously hunt down their slayer until one of them was destroyed. The odds of rising as a revenant increased to an even chance if the slain was a follower of Kiaransalee, and it was an absolute certainty if the caster of the spell was killed by the cursed individual. To trigger curse of the Revenancer, the target had to be directly responsible for the death, either by poison or by delivering the killing blow by magical, psionic, or physical attack.
This spell required verbal and somatic components as well as the priestess holy symbol. The material component was a bit of dirt from a fresh grave.
