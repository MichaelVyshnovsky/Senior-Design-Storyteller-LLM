'''''Curse of the Revenancer''''' was a [[divine magic]] [[spell]] granted to [[priestess]]es of [[Kiaransalee]], the Lady of the Dead, also known as the Revenancer. It caused the target creature to be haunted by the spirits of those they subsequently killed.

==Effects==
The priestess had to touch the intended target of the spell either during casting or within three minutes of completion. The victim had to be a living creatureâ€”the spell had no effect on the [[undead]]. The target creature had one chance to resist the magic of this spell or be permanently cursed. The only way to remove ''curse of the Revenancer'' was by a ''[[wish]]'' spell or a ''[[remove curse]]'' cast by an extremely puissant individual. After being cursed, any [[humanoid]] killed by the victim had a small chance to come back as a [[revenant]] and zealously hunt down their slayer until one of them was destroyed. The odds of rising as a revenant increased to an even chance if the slain was a follower of Kiaransalee, and it was an absolute certainty if the caster of the spell was killed by the cursed individual. To trigger ''curse of the Revenancer'', the target had to be directly responsible for the death, either by [[poison]] or by delivering the killing blow by magical, [[psionic]], or physical attack.

==Components==
This spell required [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s as well as the priestess' [[holy symbol]]. The [[material component]] was a bit of dirt from a fresh grave.
