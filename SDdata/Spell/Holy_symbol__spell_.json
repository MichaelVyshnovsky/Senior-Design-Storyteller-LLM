        "Effects": "A shugenja used this spell to create a holy symbol of their [[deity]] from a mundane item. The chosen item was required to be made by an appropriate material, and the shugenja was only able to make a holy symbol of their own deity. Depending on the [[alignment]] of the shugenja, the holy symbol radiated evil or good.",
