        "mainbody": "'''''Seed of Moander''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Moander]], enabling them to enslave sentient beings.\n\n{{quote|The [[rose]], however, was not an offering from [[Lathander]] but a trap set by Moander the Darkbringer, god of decay. The rose blossomed, and its pollen drifted into her ear, where it began to rot her from the inside out. Thus the Darkbringer hoped to gain for himself Tyche's power over luck.|[[Joel]] the Rebel Bard}}",
        "Effects": "This spell enslaved sentient beings to Moander's will by converting them into ''seeds of Moander'' which were then transformed into servants of Moander. The first step of this spell involved wrapping an [[emerald]] fragment in a rotting leaf, soaking it in [[unholy water]] for one full day, and then ''[[curse|cursing]]'' it in the name of Moander. The priest then cast ''seed of Moander'' on the seed, transforming it into a sticky green burr about the size of a [[chestnut]].\n\nThe ''seed of Moander'' could easily attach to the skin of any sentient creature who was not a minion of Moander. The seeds could be thrown but would not burst unless they made contact with flesh. After making contact, the seed would burst and release a {{SI|3|ft}} diameter cloud of spores that would be inhaled by any creature within range.\n\nIf not treated, the inhaled spores transformed the victim into Moander's puppet within several days. The victim's entrails were transformed into rotting tendrils, a change that would prove fatal after a month or two. The only change in the victim's appearance from the outside would be a scent of pollen that clung to them and a small vine that wrapped around one of their ears. The victim would spread the ''seed of Moander'' to others with any exchange of body fluids.\n\nMoander's slave retained all of their skills and abilities, but all of their thoughts were known to the god. They could sprout a pair of {{SI|10|ft}} long tentacles used to strike enemies.\n\nA ''seed of Moander'' could be destroyed by dousing it with [[holy water]] and ''[[bless|blessing]]'' it. The victim could be cured by drinking holy water within one hour of being infected. Drinking holy water within two days would slow the infection down by half. A ''[[cure disease]]'' spell would stop the infection and allow the victim to slowly begin healing. Cold magic that did a significant amount of harm to the victim's body would also kill all of the spores.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priest's [[holy symbol]] and an emerald fragment worth at least 100 [[gp]] to cast."
