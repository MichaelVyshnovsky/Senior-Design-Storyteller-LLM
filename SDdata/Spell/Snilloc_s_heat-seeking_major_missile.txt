Snillocs heat-seeking major missile was an evocation spell that worked similarly to Snillocs major missile, but did not require visual contact between the caster and the target.
The spell created missiles of magical energy that flew from the casters fingertips towards a target within a range of , in a similar way to the darts created by the magic missile spell. The damage caused by the darts and their range increased as the caster became more powerful.
Unlike snillocs major missile and magic missile, the spell did not require the caster to be able to see the intended target.
The spell required only verbal and somatic components.
The spell was developed as a minor modification of Snillocs original spell by the blind drow wizard Dostrealt, who had developed and collected a number of spells that did not rely on eyesight, so that his spellcasting ability was not hindered by his disability.
