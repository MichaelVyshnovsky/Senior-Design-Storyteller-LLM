'''''Corrosive ruin''''' was an [[evocation school|evocation]] [[spell]] used by some [[swordmage]]s of relatively low experience and power. When cast ''corrosive ruin'' shot a spinning spray of deadly acid out from a swordmage's [[blade]] into a nearby area of fifteen feet in diameter, searing any creatures caught within the blast zone. The spell was relatively easy to cast and could be recharged with a rest of a few minutes or more.
