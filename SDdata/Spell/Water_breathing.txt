Water breathing was a transmutation or alteration spell that let one or more living, air-breathing creatures breathe water temporarily. The reverse of the spell, air breathing, likewise allowed water-breathing creatures to survive out of water.
The affected creatures were able to breathe air or water effortlessly for the duration of the spell. If cast upon more than one subject, the duration of the spell was proportionally less for all subjects&mdashhalf for two, one third for three, etc.
Verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. Arcane casters needed a short reed or piece of straw for the material component. Divine casters could use their holy symbol or divine focus.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Stoca in  and was originally called Stocas water breath.
