The affected creatures were able to breathe air or water effortlessly for the duration of the spell. If cast upon more than one subject, the duration of the spell was proportionally less for all subjects&mdash;half for two, one third for three, etc.

==Components==
[[Verbal component|Verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components were required to cast this spell. Arcane casters needed a short reed or piece of straw for the [[material component]]. Divine casters could use their [[holy symbol]] or [[divine focus]].

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Stoca]] in {{Yearlink|-1792}} and was originally called '''''Stoca's water breath'''''.
