        "mainbody": "'''''Force ladder''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell created a [[ladder]] of pure force. It was nearly invisible and had the dimensions of a regular ladder, {{SI|2|ft}} is width and could be between {{SI|10|ft}} and {{SI|60|ft}} in length. It was light, only weighing {{SI|1|lb}}, but could support up to {{SI|100|lb|k}} or more. The amount of weight that the ladder could support was determined by the caster's skill level. It can be used as both a barrier and a weapon against ethereal and incorporeal creatures.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[spell focus|focus]], a small ladder crafted from [[silver]]."
