Banish flame was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Kossuth, enabling them to extinguish flames.
This spell enabled the caster to extinguish nonmagical fires. Magical fires of a continuous nature would relight after a minute. The intensity of any flame-based breath weapons used in this spells area of effect were slightly lessened depending on the skill of the caster.
