        "mainbody": "'''''Tortoise shell''''' was an [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[druid]]s.",
        "Effects": "This spell created a large protective turtle shell measuring {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in diameter. The shell was quite durable and could even float if turned upside down. The shell could be moved about by the caster as if it only weighed a few pounds, but it was much heavier if anyone else tried to move it. The shell would remain perfectly balanced if set perpendicular to the ground.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a whole turtle shell to cast."
