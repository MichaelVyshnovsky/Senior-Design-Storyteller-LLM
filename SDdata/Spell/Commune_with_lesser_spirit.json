        "mainbody": "Commune with lesser spirit was a common spell used by shamans, shugenjas, and wu jen in Kara-Tur. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.\nThis spell was a less powerful version of commune with greater spirit. Using this spell, a caster was only able to communicate with local spirits. \nFor the spell to be cast, the caster was required to know the identity of the spirit. This could be achieved with a trance spell. The target had to be within 10 feet (3 meters) of the caster. \nUpon successful casting, the caster was able to answer one question or more, depending on their skill level. These questions had to be specific and spoken clearly, and were limited to simple yes or no answers. The target would answer the question exactly and would not voluntarily divulge anything further. The chances of the question being answered depended on the alignment of the target. A good spirit would be as helpful as possible within the limits of the spell, a neutral one would answer in riddles, and an evil spirit would try to distort and twist the answer as much as possible. The target was only able to answer questions that concerned the area they affected.\nIf a caster attempted to cast this spell in the phlogiston or the void, the spell would fail. It could only be cast on a planet.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components incense and an offering of an object the target favored or coveted worth at least 10 gp."
