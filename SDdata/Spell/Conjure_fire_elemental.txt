Conjure fire elemental was a divine conjuration spell that brought one or more creatures from the Elemental Plane of Fire to assist the caster. The reverse of this spell, dismiss fire elemental, sent the summoned creatures back home.
Conjure earth elemental fell out of use in the Year of Wild Magic, when deities started granting the more diverse planar ally spell.
