'''''Bird of prey''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Anhur]] called [[Militar]]s.

==Effects==
This spell created a region of force shaped like a [[hawk]] that hovered above the target, diving down to attack them periodically. The ''bird of prey'' would only attack a single target for the spell's duration.

The ''bird of prey'' was immune to any physical or magical attacks save for a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell. A target was only able to escape a pursuing ''bird of prey'' via ''[[blink]]'', ''[[dimension door]]'', ''[[teleport]]'' or similar forms of magical travel. The bird would dissipate if its selected target used one of these methods.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
