Bird of prey was a divine evocation spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Anhur called Militars.
This spell created a region of force shaped like a hawk that hovered above the target, diving down to attack them periodically. The bird of prey would only attack a single target for the spells duration.
The bird of prey was immune to any physical or magical attacks save for a dispel magic spell. A target was only able to escape a pursuing bird of prey via blink, dimension door, teleport or similar forms of magical travel. The bird would dissipate if its selected target used one of these methods.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.
