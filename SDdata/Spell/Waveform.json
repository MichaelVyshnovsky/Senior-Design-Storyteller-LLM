        "mainbody": "Waveform was a wild magic alteration spell used by wild mages..\nThis spell allowed the caster to shape and mold water to their liking. The water affected by this spell still behaved like regular water with respects to gravity and normal fluid properties. Thus, a wizard could not use this spell to create a humanoid form of water that was capable of walking around on dry land. This spell was particularly useful in larger bodies of water where the wild mage could creating gigantic waves, geysers, whirlpools, etc.\nThe caster needed to concentrate to maintain the shaped water. If directed to crash into living creatures the waveform could easily be used to sweep away smaller creatures or move larger ones, in addition to causing physical harm. Waveform was more harmful against water-based creatures such as water elementals, but doing so would end the spell. The caster could also direct the water to crash into vessels and capsize them or damage their hull.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small carved oar decorated with aquamarines worth at least 500 gp to cast."
