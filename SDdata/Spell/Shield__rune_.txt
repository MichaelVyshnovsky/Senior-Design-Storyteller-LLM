'''''Shield''''', otherwise known in the [[giant language]] as [[Giant dictionary|'''''skold''''']], was a defensive type of [[giant]] rune.

==Effects==
When inscribed with this rune a ''[[shield]]'s'' protective properties were enhanced. This effect would last for the duration of a single battle.

If this rune was extensively studied a second or third time, then this effect would be even greater.

==Components==
Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast. The process of shaping this rune generally took around ten to eighty minutes and it needed to be inscribed upon a ''shield''.
