        "mainbody": "everwither was a relatively mundane enchantment primarily used on blossoming flowers.\nWhen cast, neverwither simply prevented flowers from wilting and dying, somewhat similar to the effects of a preservation spell.\nIn the midâ€“14 century DR, flowers enchanted with neverwither could be found inside A Kiss Across the Table, a store in Mosstone, Tethyr. The ensorcelled blossoms were used for decoration and available for purchase."
