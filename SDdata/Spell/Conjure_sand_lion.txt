}}'''''Conjure sand lion''''' was a [[spell]] used by wizards in [[Anauroch]] and [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This spell conjured a female [[spotted lion]] that was faithful to the caster. The caster could see through the lion's eyes. The sand lion was immune to [[necromancy]] and [[enchantment]] or [[charm]] spells. Spells from the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] could harm the creature.

It was impossible to cast this spell within the [[phlogiston]].

==Components==
This spell required a handful of [[sand]] to cast.
