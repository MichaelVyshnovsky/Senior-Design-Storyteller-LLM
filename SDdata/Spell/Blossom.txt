Blossom was a spell unique to Maztica.
This spell allowed a caster to transform an area to become more fertile and verdant. The spell could transform a stagnant swamp into cropland or dry prairie soil into moist soil. The spell had limitations. If an area was struck with a long drought or was in the middle of a desert, the spell had no effect. The effects of the spell lasted until the end of the season. The spell could be cast in conjunction with other spells such as water summoning.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, an ear of grain and about a gallon of water. The caster required a full day of concentration before casting the spell.
