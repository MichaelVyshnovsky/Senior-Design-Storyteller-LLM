'''''Shadow engines''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[illusion]] [[spell]] from the [[war sphere]] that created the illusion of [[siege engine]]s.

==Effects==
This spell created the illusion of up to four siege engines and crews. The casting [[priest]] could select any combination of [[ballista]]e, siege towers, [[catapult]]s, ''etc''. The [[magic]] powering the illusory siege engines imparted a tenuous reality to them, allowing them to inflict physical damage on targets. The ''shadow engines'' would last until the spell expired, enemies approached within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}, or they were damaged by a missile attack. The destruction of one ''shadow engine'' did not affect the remaining ones.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]]s a detailed miniature model of a siege engine to cast. The model was destroyed during the casting.

==History==
The ''[[Scepter of Mystra]]'', a relic of the [[Mystra]]n faith, could cast the ''shadow engines'' spell.{{cite book/Prayers from the Faithful|77-80}}
