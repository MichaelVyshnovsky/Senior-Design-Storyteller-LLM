Chant of the Red Wizards was a rare arcane enchantment spell that aided allies while hindering enemies.
This spell provided slight favorable outcomes to the caster and their allies, while having the opposite effect upon their enemies. The magic would last as long as the caster remained stationary and maintained the chant. Any interruption to the caster, including using magical silence upon them, would end the spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component an instrument that accompanied the chant to cast.
This spell was used exclusively by Red Wizards from Thay.
