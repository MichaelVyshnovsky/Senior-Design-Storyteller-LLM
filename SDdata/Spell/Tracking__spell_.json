If successfully, the psychic trace appears as a glowing pattern to the caster. The pattern glowed brighter if the targeted creature passed though the area recently. The psychic pattern were visible for up to two days. This spell was capable of detecting the psychic impressions of a creature using the ''[[pass without trace]]'' spell.",
