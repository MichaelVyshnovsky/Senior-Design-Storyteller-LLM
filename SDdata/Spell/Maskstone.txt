Maskstone was a spell used by clerics of Abbathor.
By means of this spell, the caster could change the physical appearance of stone thanks to a long-term illusion. The stone itself remained physically unchanged. Subterranean beings such as dwarves, duergar, gnomes, and xorn could easily determine that the stones appearance was changed by magical means. Some spells such as true seeing could also detect the alteration.
Reveal stone was the reverse of this spell. It removed the illusion cast by maskstone. It could also be used to detect hidden features such as door, cavities, or panels.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a small amount of sand and an eyelash. Reveal stone required a piece of gauze and a small piece of either phosphorous or iron filings.
