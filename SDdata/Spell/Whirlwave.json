        "mainbody": "'''''Whirlwave''''' was a [[divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[invocation]] [[spell]] from the [[elemental water sphere]] that formed water into a tunnel like breakers approaching a shore.",
        "Effects": "The cylinder created by ''whirlwave'' could be up to {{SI|900|ft|long=yes}} long provided there was enough water present. The interior of the cylinder contained breathable air surrounded by solid walls of water. The tunnel formed in whatever direction the caster faced when casting the spell. It could continue along a straight path, or curve toward a destination the caster viewed. Anyone traversing the interior of the tunnel was protected from normal missiles launched from outside the tunnel. Melee and magical attacks could pass through the tunnel walls, but with a degree in inaccuracy since the walls blurred the subjects found within.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] piece of [[wire]] or stiffened thread shaped into a spiral to cast.",
        "History": "''Whirlwave'' was granted to [[priest]]s of [[Umberlee]], the Bitch Queen."
