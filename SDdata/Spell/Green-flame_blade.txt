Green-flame blade, also known as greenflame blade, was an evocation spell that caused a burst of green fire to leap from a swinging melee weapon.
As the spellcaster performed an attack with a weapon affected by the spell, green flame erupted from it towards a nearby foe. The deadliness of the spell increased as the spellcaster grew more powerful as the flames also increased the damage dealt by the weapon itself.
Skilled swordmages could launch these viridian flames at multiple nearby foes, and could use both their intellect as well as their physical strength as the basis for the spells power.
The spell required a quick verbal as well as the weapon to be enhanced as the material component.
Prior to the Second Sundering, the spell was favored by swordmages, particularly so-called "assault swordmages" who employed flashy elemental magics in their fighting styles.
By the late 15 century DR, the spell was popular among War Wizards of Cormyr and bladesingers. Warlocks taking the pact of the blade also favored this spell.
