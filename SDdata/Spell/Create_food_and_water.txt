Create food and water was a conjuration or alteration spell that caused food and water to appear.
The food was simple and bland, but very nourishing. For each level of the caster, enough food and water could be created to feed three human-sized creatures or one horse-sized creature for one day. The water was like clean rain water but the food did not keep and had to be discarded after 24 hours unless purify food and drink was used to prevent spoilage.
The post sundering vertion of the spell created 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water, this should feed 15 people or 5 steeds. The food is nourishing but bland and also goes bad after 24 hours, the water is good and doesnt spoil.
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.
It was recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki.
