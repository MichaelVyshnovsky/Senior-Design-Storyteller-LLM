'''''Create food and water''''' was a [[conjuration]] or [[alteration]] spell that caused food and water to appear.

==Effects==
The food was simple and bland, but very nourishing. For each level of the caster, enough food and water could be created to feed three human-sized creatures or one horse-sized creature for one day. The water was like clean rain water but the food did not keep and had to be discarded after 24 hours unless ''[[purify food and drink]]'' was used to prevent spoilage.

The post sundering vertion of the spell created 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water, this should feed 15 people or 5 steeds. The food is nourishing but bland and also goes bad after 24 hours, the water is good and doesn't spoil.

==Components==
Only verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell.

==History==
It was recorded in ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy text of the [[church of Mielikki]].<ref>
