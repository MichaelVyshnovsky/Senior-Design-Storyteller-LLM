Pierce any shield was a more powerful version of pierce magic resistance.
This incredibly powerful spell was used by a caster to strengthen another spell against magical resistance. It had to be cast before the intended spell. The new modified spell was now invulnerable all known magical absorption, barriers, nullifying, resistance or turning.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, knife or spike cast from silver.
This spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon.
