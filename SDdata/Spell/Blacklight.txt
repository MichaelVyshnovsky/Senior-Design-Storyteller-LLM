'''''Blacklight''''' was an [[evocation]] or [[alteration]] spell that created an area of magical darkness that only the caster could see through. This spell was also available as [[divine magic]] provided to priests of [[Ibrandul]].

==Effects==
''Blacklight'' was very similar to ''[[darkness]]'' with the exception that the caster could act and see normally while within the area of effect. Normal light sources were extinguished by ''blacklight'', as well as lower-level ''[[light]]'' spells. Those outside the sphere of darkness, including the caster, could not see into the affected area. The older version of this spell created a stationary area while the newer version could be cast on a movable object if desired.

For the older version of ''blacklight'', every minute spent inside the blacklit area allowed a creature a chance to overcome the blindness, but it was difficult, and even if they succeeded their sight returned for only one minute. Also, ''[[light]]'', ''[[continual light]]'', or ''[[dispel magic]]'' would dissipate the older ''blacklight''.

For the newer version, ''blacklight'' countered ''[[daylight]]'' and any lower-level [[:Category:Light spells|light spells]]. ''Blacklight'' was countered by ''daylight'' and any higher-level light spells.

==Components==
[[Verbal component|Verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s were required to cast this spell. The material components were a small chunk of coal and a dried eyeball from any creature.

==History==
This spell was in general use around [[Faer√ªn]], once it was published in [[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (in-universe)|''Volo's Guide to All Things Magical'']].
