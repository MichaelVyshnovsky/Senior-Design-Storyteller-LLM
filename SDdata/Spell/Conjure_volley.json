        "mainbody": "'''Conjure volley''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that transformed a single missile into a volley of hundreds of missiles.",
        "Effect": "After the caster threw or launched a single nonmagical missile weapon into the air and picked an area within {{SI|150|ft}}, the area would be pelted with a volley of hundreds of the same missiles. The selected area would cover a {{SI|40|ft}} radius and {{SIAdj|20|ft|adj=tall}} cylinder, but if an individual was quick enough, they could dodge away and receive less harm from the volley. The damage of the volley was of the same type as the initial missile and the missiles would disappear after landing.",
        "Components": "Verbal and somatic components and a missile weapon were the necessary components for the spell to be cast."
