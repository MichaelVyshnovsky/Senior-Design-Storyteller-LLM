        "mainbody": "Static charge was a divine alteration spell that created an electrical imbalance on a creature.\nThis spell was very similar to call lightning, but static charge could be used indoors. The caster must have been more experienced in order to static charge, though. The electrical imbalance would give rise to electrical bolts that damaged nearby creatures that were within the casters visual range. More powerful casters allowed the electrical imbalance to last for longer."
