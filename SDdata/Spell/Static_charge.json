        "mainbody": "'''''Static charge''''' was a [[divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] that created an electrical imbalance on a creature.",
        "Effects": "This spell was very similar to ''[[call lightning]]'', but ''static charge'' could be used indoors. The caster must have been more experienced in order to ''static charge'', though. The electrical imbalance would give rise to electrical bolts that damaged nearby creatures that were within the caster's visual range. More powerful casters allowed the electrical imbalance to last for longer."
