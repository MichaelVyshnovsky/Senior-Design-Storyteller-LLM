        "Effects": "''Slowspell'' delayed the effects of spells cast within its area of effect. This spell affected an area centered on the caster, an object, or something in motion, all of which needed to be determined during the casting. The length of time a spell was delayed depended on the expertise of the ''slowspell'' caster, but could be up to several minutes. The ''slowspell'' caster's own spells were immune to the delaying effect while the spell was active.\n\nA ''slowspell'' remained active until triggered by a spell cast within its protected area. Once activated, the ''slowspell's'' duration was dependent on the skill of the caster. Even a successful ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell would take several minutes to take effect and end the ''slowspell''.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a faceted [[gemstone]] to cast. The gemstone was consumed during the casting."
