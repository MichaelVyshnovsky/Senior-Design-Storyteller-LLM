Secret word was an arcane abjuration spell that stripped a target of a single powerful spell protection.
The spell could only be cast upon a single target, from up to 40 feet (12 meters) away. It was not possible for the target to resist the spell, and they found themselves stripped of a protective enchantment. Such enchantments were granted by spells such as spell immunity, spell deflection, spell turning, spell shield, and their lesser versions.
