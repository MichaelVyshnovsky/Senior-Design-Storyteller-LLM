'''''Secret word''''' was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] that stripped a target of a single powerful spell protection.

==Effects==
The spell could only be cast upon a single target, from up to 40 feet (12 meters) away. It was not possible for the target to resist the spell, and they found themselves stripped of a protective enchantment. Such enchantments were granted by spells such as ''[[spell immunity]]'', ''[[spell deflection]]'', ''[[spell turning]]'', ''[[spell shield]]'', and their lesser versions.
