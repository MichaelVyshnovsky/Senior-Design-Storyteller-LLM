'''''Ventriloquism''''' (originally called '''''Dace's ventriloquism''''') was an [[illusion]] [[spell]] from the [[:Category:Figment spells|figment]] subschool that allowed one to throw his or her voice.

Some creatures, such as [[slayer genie]]s and [[Al-jahar|dazzles]] could innately create this magical effect.

==Effects==
By speaking into a cone made from rolled-up parchment, the caster could throw his or her voice within a relatively close range, making it sound as if it had come from someone or somewhere else.

==Components==
To cast this spell required a [[verbal component]] in addition to the parchment used as its [[spell focus|focus]].

==History==
The spell was invented by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Dace (arcanist)|Dace]] in {{Yearlink|-1859}}.

==Notable Users==
The [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] [[potion]] merchant [[Bahija Jalin]] was able to brew a mixture imbued with the power of the ''ventriloquism'' spell, yet she rarely sold it.{{cite book/City of Delights/Gem of Zakhara|57}}

In the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], [[Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] cast ''ventriloquism'' via a whisper to talk over [[Onyx the Invincible]]'s bewildered protests to help him trick [[Lawyers (Waterdeep)|a lawyer]].{{Cite comic/Lawyers!|12}}
