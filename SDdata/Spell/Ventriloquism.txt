Ventriloquism (originally called Daces ventriloquism) was an illusion spell from the figment subschool that allowed one to throw his or her voice.
Some creatures, such as slayer genies and dazzles could innately create this magical effect.
By speaking into a cone made from rolled-up parchment, the caster could throw his or her voice within a relatively close range, making it sound as if it had come from someone or somewhere else.
To cast this spell required a verbal component in addition to the parchment used as its focus.
The spell was invented by the Netherese arcanist Dace in .
The Zakharan potion merchant Bahija Jalin was able to brew a mixture imbued with the power of the ventriloquism spell, yet she rarely sold it.
In the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun cast ventriloquism via a whisper to talk over Onyx the Invincibles bewildered protests to help him trick a lawyer.
