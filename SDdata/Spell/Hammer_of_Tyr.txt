The '''''Hammer of Tyr''''' was a holy relic of the church of [[Tyr]], god of justice.

A powerful weapon against evil and the [[undead]], it could cast extraordinarily powerful ''[[turn undead]]'' and ''[[sunray]]'' spells, as well as ''[[heal]]'' allies. The ''Hammer'' could be also be used as a ''+5 [[warhammer]]'' and when thrown it returned to the wielder's hand.

Perhaps the ''Hammer'''s greatest power was to destroy ''[[pools of darkness]]'' when thrown into its waters.
