        "mainbody": "Mordenkainens faithful phantom defenders was an uncommon spell that summoned spectral defenders.\nWith this spell, a caster was able to summon spectral creatures to protect them from attacks. It was often used to give the caster time to cast a complicated spell while in battle. The spell allowed the caster to choose from four types of phantom defenders two centaurs, three soldiers, five sharks, or eight giant bats.\nWhile the phantom defenders appeared as solid, tangible creatures to others, to the caster they appeared transparent and incorporeal. As they were not affected by spells cast by the caster, the caster was able to launch spells through them towards their enemies.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components a lead figure of the creature to be summoned and an expensive emerald. The emerald had to be valued at least 1,000 gp and was consumed during casting."
