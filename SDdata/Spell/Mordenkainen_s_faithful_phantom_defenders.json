        "mainbody": "'''''Mordenkainen's faithful phantom defenders''''' was an uncommon [[spell]] that summoned spectral defenders.",
        "Effects": "With this spell, a caster was able to summon spectral creatures to protect them from attacks. It was often used to give the caster time to cast a complicated spell while in battle. The spell allowed the caster to choose from four types of phantom defenders: two [[centaur]]s, three soldiers, five [[shark]]s, or eight [[giant bat]]s.\n\nWhile the phantom defenders appeared as solid, tangible creatures to others, to the caster they appeared transparent and incorporeal. As they were not affected by spells cast by the caster, the caster was able to launch spells through them towards their enemies.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s: a lead figure of the creature to be summoned and an expensive [[emerald]]. The emerald had to be valued at least 1,000 [[gp]] and was consumed during casting."
