        "mainbody": "Andruis baneful backfire was an abjuration spell from the 5 circle of magic invented by Andrui of Oerth and designed to protect a wizards active enchantments and magical items.\nThe spells target was an active ensorcellment, be it magic made permanent or a creature temporarily slowed down, or an enchanted item located within the casters eyesight. After being cast, Andruis baneful backfire remained dormant until an attempt was made to magically tamper or dispel the spells target. Firstly, once triggered, baneful backfire automatically caused all attempts to dispel magic to fail. The shock caused by that failure also burned a single spell out of the casters memory. The lost spell was of an equal level as the spell that was being dispelled. If the caster did not have a spell of such level in their memory, the baneful backfire burned a spell of the next lower circle of magic. The spells only limitation was the power of its caster. Only a spellcaster more powerful than the mage who placed Andruis baneful backfire could dispel the enchantment in question as well as the baneful backfire cast upon it.\nAndruis baneful backfire required verbal, somatic, and material components to be cast. Its material components were a square 3-inch (7.6 centimeters) piece of carpet and a small clump of cat hair.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the Wail of the Banshee, a ship made of bone that belonged to Mezzalcat, a drow necromancer, was protected by the Andruis baneful backfire spell. The ship was docked in Tradesport, an island fortress in the Sea of Endless Darkness in the Underdark underneath the Vast."
