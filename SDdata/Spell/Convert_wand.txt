Convert wand was a divine transmutation spell that altered a wands magical spell into a healing spell.
Magic wands transformed by convert wand had whatever spell that was stored within them turned into a healing spell of the same power, namely cure light wounds, cure moderate wounds, cure serious wounds, and cure critical wounds. The effects were only temporary, lasting at least nine minutes, and the wand did not receive new charges but would expend charges as healing spells were used.
