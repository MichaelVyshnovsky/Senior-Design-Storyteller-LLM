'''''Convert wand''''' was a [[divine]] [[transmutation]] spell that altered a [[wand]]'s magical spell into a healing spell.

==Effect==
Magic wands transformed by ''convert wand'' had whatever spell that was stored within them turned into a healing spell of the same power, namely ''[[cure light wounds]]'', ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'', ''[[cure serious wounds]]'', and ''[[cure critical wounds]]''. The effects were only temporary, lasting at least nine minutes, and the wand did not receive new charges but would expend charges as healing spells were used.
