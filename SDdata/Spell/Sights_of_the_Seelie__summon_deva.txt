'''''Sights of the Seelie: summon deva''''' was an [[arcane magic]] [[spell]] from the school of [[conjuration]] and functioned similarly to the ''[[planar ally]]'' spell.

==Effects==
When cast, the ''sights of the Seelie'' spell summoned a [[deva]] ally to aid the caster for a limited period of time. The deva could perform a ''[[wrathful smite]]'' in battle and use curative magics like ''[[revivify]]''.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the presumed original copy of ''[[Caution Before the Seelie]]'' was storred within a study, hidden by an illusory wall in the vaults of the ''[[Ramazith's tower]]'' of [[Baldur's Gate]], that at the time belonged to the [[Athkatla]]n mage of dubious morals [[Lorroakan]]. The book held a rare magic ''[[scroll]] of bestial communion'' that allowed a wizard to scribe the ''sights of the Seelie: summon deva'' spell into their ''[[spellbook]].''
