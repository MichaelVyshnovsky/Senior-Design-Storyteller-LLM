        "mainbody": "Call of despair was an Elven High Magic wizard spell useful for defending elven homelands.\nWhen cast this spell forced all but the bravest creatures to flee in absolute terror. This spell was used against enemies attacking an elven homeland and elven defenders and their allies were immune to the spells effect. The effect of the call of despair lasted longer depending on the skill of the caster.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a small brass gong to cast."
