        "mainbody": "'''''Spiderform''''' was a [[transmutation]] spell unique to [[cleric]]s with the [[Drow domain]]. It turned the caster into either a [[drider]] or a [[spider]].",
        "Effects": {
            "Before [[1372 DR]]": "The caster could target several animals or one [[drow]] but the spell's effect differed depending on who or what it was cast on.\n\nCast on animals or arachnids, the targets turned into [[giant spider]]s with weaker poison, that caused those who succumbed to it to be stunned for a minute and ''[[slow]]ed'' for the remaining duration but without any lethal danger. The giant spider thus made couldn't spin its own webs but could traverse other webs, including magical ones, without problems\n\nCast on a drow, the spell caused the targets to be turned into a [[drider]]. This drider was under the influence of the caster like a ''charmed'' creature was. This meant there were a number of limitations to the control the caster had over the target. It couldn't order it to do anything, that contradicted a superior's order, [[Lolth]]'s orders, the target's own nature or its self-preservation.",
            "1372 DR": "By 1372 DR, the spell had new effects. It allowed the caster to turn into a [[giant spider]] of varying size or a drider. Unlike the old version, the new version allowed the usage of the spider's full abilities including web spinning and poison."
        },
        "Components": "The spell's old version required [[verbal]], [[somatic]] and [[material]] components in the form of a small spider that fit in the caster's hand, while the new version required instead a [[divine focus]].",
        "History": "The spell was originally developed by the clergy of Lolth. Prior to 1372 DR, the spell was one of those spells whose usage didn't spill over into the other [[Dark Seldarine|drow faiths]], but by 1372DR, the spell went into usage of all drow churches."
