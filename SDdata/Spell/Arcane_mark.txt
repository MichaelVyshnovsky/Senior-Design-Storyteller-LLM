'''''Arcane mark''''', also known as '''''wizard mark''''' in times and places unfamiliar with [[sorcerer]]s, was originally from the [[alteration]] [[school of magic]], but became a [[universal spell]] that anyone practicing [[the Art]] could cast. It was simple enough to learn that it became a [[cantrip]].

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to put a [[signature rune|personal rune]] or mark of up to six characters on any object he or she could touch. The symbols had to fit within a 1 foot (30 centimeters) square to maintain cohesiveness. The writing could be visible or invisible, and was magical, so a ''[[detect magic]]'' made it glow, and a ''[[read magic]]'' revealed the meaning, if any. Other means, such as a ''[[see invisibility]]'' spell, a ''[[robe of eyes]]'', a ''[[gem of seeing]]'', or ''[[true sight]]'' also revealed an invisible ''mark''. The ''mark'' did not physically alter or damage the object in any way, even though it seemed to be etched into the surface. The object was permanently marked until the caster dispelled his or her own mark, or an ''[[erase]]'' spell was used on it. If the ''mark'' was placed on a living creature, then it normally faded away in about a month.

Some versions of ''[[Drawmij's instant summons]]'' required an ''arcane mark'' be placed on an object before it could be summoned.

Objects with an ''arcane mark'' could be used to trigger an ''[[arcane mark ward]]''.{{Cite dragon/289/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Shunned Street|101}}

==Components==
All versions of this spell required a verbal utterance and the somatic gestures of drawing the sigils. The early version of this spell also required a material component of a pinch of [[diamond]] dust worth about 100 [[gp]] and one or more pigments with which to draw the symbols. The caster used a finger for a visible symbol or a stylus for an invisible one.
