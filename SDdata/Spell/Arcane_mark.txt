Arcane mark, also known as wizard mark in times and places unfamiliar with sorcerers, was originally from the alteration school of magic, but became a universal spell that anyone practicing the Art could cast. It was simple enough to learn that it became a cantrip.
This spell allowed the caster to put a personal rune or mark of up to six characters on any object he or she could touch. The symbols had to fit within a 1 foot (30 centimeters) square to maintain cohesiveness. The writing could be visible or invisible, and was magical, so a detect magic made it glow, and a read magic revealed the meaning, if any. Other means, such as a see invisibility spell, a robe of eyes, a gem of seeing, or true sight also revealed an invisible mark. The mark did not physically alter or damage the object in any way, even though it seemed to be etched into the surface. The object was permanently marked until the caster dispelled his or her own mark, or an erase spell was used on it. If the mark was placed on a living creature, then it normally faded away in about a month.
Some versions of Drawmijs instant summons required an arcane mark be placed on an object before it could be summoned.
Objects with an arcane mark could be used to trigger an arcane mark ward.
All versions of this spell required a verbal utterance and the somatic gestures of drawing the sigils. The early version of this spell also required a material component of a pinch of diamond dust worth about 100 gp and one or more pigments with which to draw the symbols. The caster used a finger for a visible symbol or a stylus for an invisible one.
