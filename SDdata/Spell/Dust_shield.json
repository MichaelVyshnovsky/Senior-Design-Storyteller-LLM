        "mainbody": "'''''Dust shield''''' was a [[southern magic]] [[divine magic|divine]] spell available to worshipers of [[Geb]].",
        "Effects": "When cast, the spell created an impenetrable barrier of dust. Once the barrier was in place, it could not be moved by the caster. Only the ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell or a mental command from the caster could remove the barrier before the spell expires. The caster was able to cast the spell around one of their arms, providing a full body shield. If a caster cast it in this fashion, they were unable to wield a [[shield]] or in conjunction with the ''[[shield (spell)|shield]]'' spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to a [[Verbal component|verbal]] component, this spell required [[material component]]s, a small amount of dust along with the caster's holy symbol."
