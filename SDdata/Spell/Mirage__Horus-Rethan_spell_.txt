'''''Mirage''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[illusion]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Horus-Re]] called [[Sunhawk]]s.

==Effects==
This spell caused all targets within a {{SI|30|ft}} cube to see a tantalizing mirage on the horizon to was difficult to resist. The caster picked the form the mirage would take, and it would always stay out of reach of the targets. The targets did not need to be facing the direction of the mirage for it to grab their attention as it would flicker on the periphery of their vision if they were looking elsewhere.

The ''mirage'' could be ended by a ''[[dispel magic]]'' spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as a [[material component]] the Sunhawk's [[holy symbol]] and a few drops of water flicked into the air to cast.
