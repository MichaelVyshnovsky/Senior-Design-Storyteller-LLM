Quest was an enchantment spell that commanded a subject to undertake a task and return with proof the task had been completed.
This divine version of the old geas spell could be used to coerce a creature to perform a significant task but unwilling subjects had a chance to resist,The spell description does not stipulate that the subject be able to speak the casters language or understand the instructions, or any of the requirements listed for the geas spell&mdashit is left very open to interpretation. even under duress or through deception, this spell was irresistible. Members of the same religion as the caster were also powerless to resist a quest, and creatures of the same alignment as the caster were much more likely to succumb.
Under the burden of this spell, any procrastination or perversion of the quests instructions resulted in a daily reduction in luck such that it became more and more difficult to avoid harm, sickness, and disease (not to mention breath weapons and petrification). This bad luck accumulated until the subject earnestly pursued the quest and persisted until the quest was completed.
The caster could dismiss the quest at any time, or temporarily suspend the quest if the circumstances warranted. Otherwise, the onus of this enchantment could not be removed except by another priest of the same religion, a higher level priest of any religion, or direct intervention by a deity. Some artifacts or relics may have been exceptions to this rule.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of the casters holy symbol.
