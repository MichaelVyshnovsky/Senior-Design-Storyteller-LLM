Bloodflame, also called "mass resurrection", was a unique and powerful necromancy spell invented by Thyaast Ammath who sacrificed her life for Myth Drannor during the Weeping War.
Once unleashed, the magical fires of the Bloodflame jumped from corpse to corpse, returning them to semblance of life.
Thyaast Ammath was considered to be a prodigy of the arcane and spent years woking on a powerful spell of her own creation - the Bloodflame. When the Weeping War arrived to he gates of the City of Song, Thyaast foreseen the doom of her home but moved to never leave it. She performed necromantic rituals transforming herself into a spectral lich, a unique form of undead and feverishly tried to finish the work on the "mass resurrection". The new undead state deteriorated her mental state but she managed to join the final events of 714 DR. Armed with the magics, she unleashed the Bloodflame on the field of dead defenders of the city. The outcome of the unleashed spell remained unrecorded, even though the lich survived the War in one way of the other and returned to obsessively work on her spells following the centuries that followed.
Another copy of the spell remained scribbled on an unfinished parchment scroll in Thyaasts laboratory at the bottom of the Elven Catacombs under Castle Cormanthor.
