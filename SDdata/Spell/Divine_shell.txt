Divine shell was a defensive spell from the abjuration school of magic, used by divine spellcasters and silverstars of Sel√ªne.
When the spell was uttered, the caster became surrounded by a maelstrom of magical energy and blocked and deflected attacks coming their way. Even if attacks managed to penetrate the barrier, their deadliness was significantly reduced, and the divine shell adsorbed it in part. It also absorbed part of any electricity, fire, cold, or acid attack. Additionally, divine shells made the casters completely impervious to missile attacks. Lastly, the casters protections and reactions to various dangers, both physical and magical, were boosted and the spell allowed them a slight advantage in shaking off negative effects.
