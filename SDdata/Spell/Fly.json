        "mainbody": "Fly was a transmutation spell or supernatural ability that allowed the caster to fly for a time by simply concentrating.\nClerics of Baervan Wildwanderer, Brandobaris, Gwaeron Windstrom, Herne, Hoar, Ibrandul, Kelemvor, Lliira, Marthammor Duin, Mielikki, Myrkul, Oghma, Sehanine Moonbow, Sel√ªne, Sharess, Shaundakul, Tyche, Tymora, Vhaeraun, and Waukeen were also sometimes granted this spell.\nThis spell granted the power of flight to the caster and in some cases a target. The effected being could fly as long as the caster held his or her concentration for at least three minutes and perhaps longer if the spellcaster was powerful enough..\nThe one effected by this spell could fly at a maximum speed of twelve miles (nineteen kilometers) per hour with good maneuverability. A subject carrying a medium or heavy load was slowed down by a third. One could gain or drop elevation at only half speed. Maintaining control only required as much thought as walking, so one could easily perform other actions, such as attacking or casting another spell, while flying.\nIf the spell wore off or was dispelled while the subject was in the air, he or she would not drop to the ground instantly there would be some number of seconds of descent at a safe rate before plummeting. Flying into an antimagic field, however, would immediately cause the flyer to fall.\nProper casting of this spell required verbal and somatic components and the use of a spell focus. The focus could be the wing feather of any bird. Clerics who used this spell would instead use their holy symbol as a focus.\nthumb|Dwalimar Omen casting Fly.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Stoca in  and was originally called Stocas wings."
