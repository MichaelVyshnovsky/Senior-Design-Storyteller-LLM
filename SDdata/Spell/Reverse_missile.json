        "mainbody": "Reverse missile was a rare abjuration spell of the southern magic tradition.\nThe spell protected the caster from all missile weapons, including mundane missiles such as arrows or ballistae, and magical missiles such as magic missile or Melfs acid arrow. The caster was still vulnerable to non-missile ranged attacks, including fireball and disintegrate, however.\nThe missile would reverse course and strike the attacker, as long as they were in range of the spell, which was 80 yards (73 meters). A reversed missile always struck their target, and the attacker took double the damage.\nThe spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast."
