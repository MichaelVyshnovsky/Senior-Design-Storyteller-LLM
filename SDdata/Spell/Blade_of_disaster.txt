'''''Blade of disaster''''', also known as '''''black blade of disaster''''', was a powerful [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that weaponized a rift in the very structure of the [[planes]] that could be used to cut through anything in its path. It could be learned by [[sorcerer]]s, [[warlock]]s, and [[wizard]]s

==Effects==
The spell summoned a {{SIAdj|3|ft|adj=long}} crack between the planes that was roughly shaped like a dark blade. The "blade" appeared at a point of the caster's choosing within a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} and lasted up to a minute, as long as the caster maintained concentration. It could be commanded by the caster to move around and perform muliple devastating attacks against opponents in quick succession. The blade dealt great damage against all creatures that touched it and could even ''[[disintegrate]]'' them if a vital spot was hit.

The version that had become most popular in {{yearlink|1375}} was vulnerable to ''[[dimensional anchor]]'', and would collapse if struck with one.

==Components==
The spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.

==History==
''Black blade of disaster'' was a spell of the dreaded [[drow]] of the [[Underdark]],{{cite book/Stardeep|152-154}}
