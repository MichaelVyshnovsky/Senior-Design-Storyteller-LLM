        "mainbody": "'''''Immunity to weapons''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[shugenja]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.",
        "Effects": "When cast, this spell allowed the shugenja or targeted creature to gain an immunity to all non-magical weapons. A powerful shugenja was able to use this spell to grant immunity to some magical weapons as well. Once cast, the recipient was immune to damage caused by a weapon. This immunity only applied to weapons, the recipient was still vulnerable to natural abilities, such as fangs or claws. They were also vulnerable to weapons wielded by very powerful creatures.\n\n''[[Vulnerability]]'' was the reverse of the spell. It had the opposite effect, lowering a targeted creature's tolerance for damage. It also allowed a creature who was immune to non-magical weapons to become vulnerable to such as attack.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell and its reverse required a [[material component]]: a dagger worth 5 [[ch'ien]]. The dagger was shattered by the shugenja when the spell was cast."
