Diluvial torrent was spell of epic magic.
On casting, diluvial torrent dropped a 100-feet-tall (30 meters) cylinder of water with a radius of 20 feet (6 meters) from a height of 200 feet (61 meters) on the caster, meaning 628,000 cubic feet (17,783 kiloliters) of water. The mass of water caused tremendous damage that was not merely attributed to the moving mass, but also to the magical energy that came crushing down with the water. It caused most damage in the area within 100 feet (30 meters) of the caster and spread less and less, but never negligible, amounts of destruction within a radius of up to 750 feet (229 meters). Apart from the mass, drowning could be a problem.
As mentioned above, the mass of water crushed the caster. The spell gave complete immunity against the magical energy, but conferred nothing of the sort against the physical destructiveness of the water that was equally responsible for the destruction. The caster could also drown.
Diluvial torrent required somatic, verbal, and material components. The material component was a silver gong that was used on completing the one-minute-long casting of the spell and was certainly destroyed when the water came crushing down.
In the 14 century DR, diluvial torrent was acknowledged as one of the most fearsome spells ever developed on Faer√ªn.
