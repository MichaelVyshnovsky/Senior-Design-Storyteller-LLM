        "Effects": "This powerful spell allowed the caster to channel raw magical energy and shape it as they desired. In some ways it was similar to a ''[[wish]]'' spell.\n\n''Wildfire'' could replicate the effects of all but the most powerful spells provided the caster had a general knowledge of the spell. The desired spell did not need to be one known or memorized by the caster. ''Wildfire'' could also create [[magic item]]s provided the items effects were not similar to effects from any spell.\n\nThe caster could create an item out of nothing. The created item possessed a greenish glow, was practically weightless, and incredibly strong. These items were also immune to cold, electricity, fire and all magical attacks with the exception of a ''wish'' or ''[[dispel magic]]''. The spell could only create an object smaller than a {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} sphere. As items created by ''wildfire'' were done so with wild magic, they were inherently unstable, slowly deteriorating over the course of several hours until nothing remained.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] components to cast."
