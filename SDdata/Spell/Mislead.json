        "mainbody": "Mislead was an illusion spell that turned the caster invisible and created an illusory double.\nThe illusory double created by this spell was not only a duplicate of its caster in terms of looks, but in terms of how they felt, how they smelled, and how they sounded.\nIf the contact psionic power was attempted against a spellcaster using mislead, it would fail automatically, but the psionics user would also immediately notice the deception.\nThe spell required only a somatic component to be cast.\nThe spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Enollar in  and was originally called Enollars mislead."
