'''''Conjure lesser fire elemental''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[wizard]]s that brought a native from the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] to assist the caster.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell summoned a [[fire elemental]] to serve the caster until the spell expired. The caster had to concentrate to maintain control of the creature. The spell always carried a certain risk that the conjured elemental would break free. If this occurred, the fire elemental became crazed and overcome with the need to bring violence upon the caster. The summoned fire elemental remained in this berserk-like state until it was banished back to the Plane of Fire, killed or the spell expired. Additionally, there was a small caster could regain control of the creature with a charm-based spell.
