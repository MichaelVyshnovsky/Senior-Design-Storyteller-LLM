'''''Devil's tail''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that gave the caster a tail.

==Effects==
On casting ''devil's tail'', a tail grew from the caster's body. This black or red 3-foot-long (91.44 cm) tail was spiked at the end. This tail's value lay in its potential as a weapon. The caster had it so well under control that it could be employed as a weapon even in conjunction with other hand-held ones. However, doing such a thing was detrimental to the accuracy of the attacks. The spell had a minimum duration of an entire minute and lasted longer the stronger the caster was.

==Components==
The casting of ''devil's tail'' required somatic and verbal components.

==History==
The only known way to obtain ''devil's tail'' was through the [[Diabolic domain]], a suit of spells that was not granted by all infernal entities.
