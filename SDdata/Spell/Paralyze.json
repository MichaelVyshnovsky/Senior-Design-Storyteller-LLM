        "mainbody": "Paralyze was a necromancy spell that allowed the caster to immobilize creatures with a successful touch attack.\nThis spell gave the caster a paralyzing touch for a number of minutes equal to his or her experience level. For the duration, any living creature successfully touched (as an attack) by the caster was paralyzed for a few minutes unless they were able to resist the spell. Undead and non-living creatures like golems were immune to this spell, as were any creatures naturally immune to paralysis.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a bit of ghoul flesh to cast."
