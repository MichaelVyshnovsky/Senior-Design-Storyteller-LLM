        "Effects": "This spell gave the caster a paralyzing touch for a number of minutes equal to his or her experience level. For the duration, any living creature successfully touched (as an attack) by the caster was paralyzed for a few minutes unless they were able to resist the spell. [[Undead]] and non-living creatures like [[golems]] were immune to this spell, as were any creatures naturally immune to paralysis.",
