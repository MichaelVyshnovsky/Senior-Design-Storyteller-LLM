Though cursebite relied primarily on a warlocks charisma for power, dark pact warlocks with a high enough intellect could cast cursebite with even greater lethality. \nCursebite was a somewhat complex spell, and requires its caster to rest briefly before casting it again.\nCategoryWarlock spells\ncera38pehhsyy8ch2iyck9y37dtvuba"
