        "Effect": "''Cursebite'' took advantage of a warlock's ability to curse their foes and each creature so cursed within an area of fifty feet in radius could become affected with ''cursebite'', which struck deep into their life force. Though ''cursebite'' relied primarily on a warlock's charisma for power, dark pact warlocks with a high enough intellect could cast ''cursebite'' with even greater lethality. \n\n''Cursebite'' was a somewhat complex spell, and requires its caster to rest briefly before casting it again.<ref>",
