}}'''''Life water''''' was a [[spell]] used by wizards in [[Anauroch]] and [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate.

==Effects==
This wondrous spell transformed any liquid into a magical serum capable of healing wounds, curing blindness, disease, poison, rot, feeblemindedness, etc. Severed limbs could be regenerated after applying the liquid. This serum could not bring life back to a dead body and it could not revert a transformed creature back to its original form.

A gallon (3.79 l) of this serum completely cured a man-sized creature. A water skin of this serum would cure only one ailment. The serum was applied to the skin and absorbed where its healing effects took place.

==Components==
This spell required any liquid to cast.
