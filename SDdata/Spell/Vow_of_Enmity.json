        "mainbody": "The Vow of Enmity, also called an oath of enmity, was a channel divinity power granted to avengers, paladins who had sworn an Oath of Vengeance.\nA Vow of Enmity was a divinely granted power to strike down a chosen foe. The avenger uttered a spiteful prayer against a foe, which granted them extraordinary accuracy in their attacks against it. While any paladin who had sworn an Oath of Vengeance gained this power, those avengers who had been formally trained by their secret orders could use a version of it with much greater reach. Vengeance-bound paladins who gained great power came to be known as a Soul of Vengeance, and could quickly strike to punish the targets of their Vow if they tried to attack in combat. \nIn addition, some avengers trained in special tactics and prayers that were more devastating against the targets of their oaths of enmity. At the most basic level, this included training in the ways of using divine power to censure their targets\nThe Censure of Pursuit granted the avenger divine quickness to strike at the target of their oath of enmity if it attempted to flee from them. This form of censure was favored by so-called pursuing avengers.\nThe Censure of Retribution involved the use of cruel cunning, and allowed the avenger to strike at the target of their oath of enmity with greater ferocity whenever the targets allies tried to assist it in the fight. This form of censure was favored by so-called isolating avengers.\nThe Censure of Unity drew upon the aid of allies, and granted the avenger greater strength for every friend assisting them in melee against the target of their oath of enmity. This form of censure was favored by so-called commanding avengers."
