        "mainbody": "Army was a rare and powerful conjuration spell of the southern magic tradition that would allow the caster to instantly summon an army.\nThe spell created soldiers made of stone, dirt, or sand. The number of soldiers summoned and the duration of their existence depended on the wizards skill (more experienced casters could summon more soldiers that lasted longer). These soldiers obeyed the orders of the caster only, and were immune to all enchantment or charm spells. The soldiers had a range of up to 500 yards (457 meters) from the caster. When the spell was cast, the soldiers appeared within a 250-yard (229-meter) radius of the caster, arranged as the caster desired. When the spell expired, the soldiers vanished.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, an expensive diamond, at least 5,000 gp in value, for a material component. This diamond was crushed into dust during casting."
