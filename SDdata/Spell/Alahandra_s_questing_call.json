        "mainbody": "Alahandras questing call was a spell that Alahandra created to call adventurers to a quest.\nThe spell called forth the vague shadowy images of adventurers within  who were not on a quest at the moment, as well as their general location for at least 15 minutes, more for more advanced mages. The spellcaster had little control over which adventurers the spell showed about three out of every ten times, the spell showed nothing, or scenes from other planes.\nBesides verbal and somatic components, the spell called for a silver mirror, a candle made of beeswax, and a small bell. The mirror remained after casting.\nThe spell had been developed by Alahandra, a hedge wizard of Waterdeep. The spell was quite rare, and less than one in thirty wizards outside of hedge wizards bothered to learn it."
