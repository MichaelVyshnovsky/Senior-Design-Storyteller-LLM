'''''Doomtide''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that created a cloud of illusory black fog.

==Effects==
When this spell was cast, the [[cleric]] created a fog of black mist that appeared to most as a mass of writhing tentacles. This cloud could be no longer than {{SI|8000|cu. ft|long=yes}} and could be directed to move at a rate of {{SIspeed|3|yards|min||min|long=yes}}.

The cloud obstructed the view and ''[[daze]]d'' any person or creature caught within, save for the caster and one ally.

A ''doomtide'' could be ''[[dispel magic|dispelled]]'' and be blown away by [[magic]]al winds. It was completely unaffected by naturally-occurring winds, regardless of their intensity.

==Components==
This spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]] and various [[material component]]s, including: a pinch of soot, a whole [[eel]] or piece of eel flesh and a piece of string with three knots tied into it.

==History==
The specifications of ''Doomtide'' were inscribed into the [[Beshaba]]n [[relic]], ''[[the Black Book]]''.
