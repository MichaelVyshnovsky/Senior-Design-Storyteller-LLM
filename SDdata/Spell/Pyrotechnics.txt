'''''Pyrotechnics''''' was a [[spell]] from the [[transmutation]] school or the [[alteration]] school that operated on a normal fire to produce either bright, blinding fireworks or billowing clouds of thick, choking smoke.

==Casters==
In the time of [[Netheril]], ''Primidon's pyrotechnics'' could be cast by [[arcanist]]s of the Inventive specialization.

''Pyrotechnics'' could originally be learned and cast by arcane [[magic-user]]s and by [[druid]]s. After the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], it could be cast by druids, [[wizard]]s with access to the [[alteration]] school, and [[cleric]]s, particularly those who commanded the  [[Elemental sphere|Elemental]] and [[Elemental fire sphere|Elemental Fire]] spheres. as well as [[warmage]]s and [[wu jen]].

In [[Zakhara]], [[elemental mage]]s and [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]] could learn it as part of the [[Flame (province)|Flame province]].

==Effects==
The caster chose an existing fire source at a distance of {{SI|400|ft|long=yes}} or more, and turned it into smoke or fireworks as they willed.

The ''fireworks'' version produced a brief burst of lights in the air over the fire source These were glowing, fiery, multi-colored, and flashing. All creatures within {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} who beheld risked becoming blinding for a short period of time, though those who could resist spells might avoid it.

The ''smoke cloud'' version caused the fire source to emit a writhing stream of smoke, which billowed outwards for {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in all directions. The thick smoke blocked all natural sight. Creatures caught within the cloud choked on the smoke and were weakened for a short period of time, even after they escaped the cloud or it dissipated, which it did in a short time. This effect could also be used to foul the [[air envelope]] of a spelljammer.

The spell could not be cast in the [[phlogiston]], since any fire source immediately exploded upon contact with the substance.

==Components==
In addition to typical [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components, ''pyrotechnics'' required an existing fire source as a [[material component]]. A small fire would be immediately put out by the casting, but one larger than {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} wide and just as high would be only partially extinguished. A magical fire could not be extinguished at any size.

A fire-based creature, like a [[fire elemental]], could also be used as a fire source. It would take damage according to the power of the caster.

==History==
This spell was invented by a [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] named [[Primidon]] in [[-1941 DR|1918 NY (âˆ’1941 DR)]] and was known as ''Primidon's pyrotechnics''.

==Notable items==
An ''[[annulus conflagros]]'', a powerful magical ring, could produce ''pyrotechnics'' at will.

==Notable uses==
In the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]], the wizard [[Parwyyd Hanifar]], acting on the advice of his assistant [[Dunstanny]], approached a fire elemental and used it as a fire source for a ''pyrotechnics'' spell. This obliterated the elemental and the ensuing fireworks dazzled a number of [[gargoyle]]s and [[kenku (winged)|kenku]]s that had emerged from his [[Great Door]].{{Cite comic/Day of the Darkening|17-18}}
