Power word, maladroit was an enchantment spell that made the target creature clumsy.
Once the power word was uttered, the target creature started to feel a compulsion to be clumsy, ungainly, and awkward. The spells effects affected the targets dexterity, making it hard for them to avoid attacks or perform actions that required nimbleness or sleight of hand. The length of the spell depended on the spellcasters arcane prowess and vitality of the target creature. Some stronger creatures were completely unaffected by the spell.
Power word, maladroit required only vocal component to be cast.
In the , a copy of the spell could be found in the archive library of the Loremaster of Nimbre in Samarach, Chult.
