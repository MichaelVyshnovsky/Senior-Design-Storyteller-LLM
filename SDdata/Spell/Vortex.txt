Vortex was a wild magic evocation spell used by wild mages.
This spell created a vortex which was a swirling chaotic mass of pure energy barely controllable by the caster. A vortex stood  tall with a diameter of .
Once a vortex was created the caster needed to maintain concentration in order for it to remain. The caster could attempt to direct the movement of the vortex, though half the time the vortex moved somewhere else. The vortex could easily pass through any object smaller than itself, but was redirect when contacting larger objects.
Any non-magical creature touched by the vortex was injured, but magical creatures were harmed more because of the nature of the vortex. There was a small chance that the vortex would violently explode in a wild surge each time it contacted a living creature.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a silk streamer and a handful of straw to cast.
