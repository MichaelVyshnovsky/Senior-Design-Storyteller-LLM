'''''Soul shift''''' was a very rare [[Necromancy|necromatic]] spell of the [[southern magic]] tradition.{{Southernmagic}}

==Effects==
This was an extremely powerful spell that transferred the soul of a [[necromancer]] into a previously prepared corpse. The corpse was required to be within a 10 mile (16 kilometer) radius of the necromancer, and free of disease, injury or wounds. The necromancer's body remained alive, but without a soul and similar to a zombie. The necromancer retained all spell knowledge they had before the transfer. The spell was one-way; the necromancer was unable to return to their original body.
 
==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a [[material component]], a crushed [[ruby]] worth at least 1,000 [[gp]].
