Soul shift was a very rare necromatic spell of the southern magic tradition.
This was an extremely powerful spell that transferred the soul of a necromancer into a previously prepared corpse. The corpse was required to be within a 10 mile (16 kilometer) radius of the necromancer, and free of disease, injury or wounds. The necromancers body remained alive, but without a soul and similar to a zombie. The necromancer retained all spell knowledge they had before the transfer. The spell was one-way the necromancer was unable to return to their original body.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, a crushed ruby worth at least 1,000 gp.
