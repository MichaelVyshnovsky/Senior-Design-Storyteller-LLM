'''''False vision''''' was an [[illusion]] spell that fooled scrying with an illusion.

==Effect==
A caster used this spell to become undetectable to all forms of scrying. If the caster knew about the scrying, they could use this spell to create an illusion which was detected by the creature scrying. This illusions could be both visual and audible. This illusion required the caster's full concentration, if they lost focus the illusion was lifted and a re-casting of the spell was required to create a new one. Despite this, the area in which the caster was in remained protected from scrying.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], ground dust of a [[jade]] with a minimu value of 250 [[gp]]. During casting, this dust was released into the air.

==History==
The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Smolyn]] in {{Yearlink|-1919}} and was originally called ''Smolyn's fraud''.
