        "mainbody": "Curse of lycanthropy was a very rare wizard spell of the alteration and necromancy schools of magic that allowed the caster to inflict a temporary case of the condition lycanthropy as a curse. It was normally used by evil wizards.\nBy touching a desired victim, the caster inflicted a form of lycanthropy based upon whatever animal blood they used in the casting. Only humans, demihumans, and some humanoids could be affected by this spell. True lycanthropes and shapeshifters were unaffected.\nFrom then on the victim would be forcefully transformed every month on the night prior to a full moon, on the night of the full moon, and on the night following the full moon. This lasted from moonrise to moonset, during which time the afflicted would be beset by a horrible bloodrage, urging them to commit murder and cause mayhem. In particular, these urges drew the afflicted towards those they had strong feelings for. The victim would retain no memories of their actions while transformed and could not transmit the condition to their victims.\nAfter the monthly three-night period there was a chance the victim could shake off the effects of the spell, but it was very difficult to accomplish. Otherwise the victim could attempt to have their condition fixed by remove curse or a wish spell.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, casting this spell required a material component in the form of blood from any mundane animal. Alternatively, a drop of blood from a true lycanthrope could be used.\nSometime in the 14 century DR, a wizard in Ravens Bluff by the name of Stefan used this spell on the traveling acrobat Tarkunian in retaliation for having ruined one of his illusions. However, Stefan mistakenly believed he was casting shape change at the time, having been told as such by the sage he purchased the spell from. In any case, he turned Tarkunian into a wererat. Being a devout Selûnite, Tarkunian went to the citys local Temple of Selûne for help, but he could not afford their fees for a casting of remove curse. A month later a group of adventurers were contacted by the Selûnite priestess Silverheart to help him on the day a full moon was going to occur. Eventually the group tracked down Stefan who, after having learned of the true nature of what he had done, was very apologetic and offered to pay the cost for the remove curse spell."
