        "mainbody": "'''''Curse of lycanthropy''''' was a very rare [[wizard]] [[spell]] of the [[alteration]] and [[necromancy]] [[schools of magic]] that allowed the caster to inflict a temporary case of the condition [[lycanthropy]] as a [[curse]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Abjuration\" /> It was normally used by [[evil]] wizards.",
        "Effects": "By touching a desired victim, the caster inflicted a form of lycanthropy based upon whatever [[animal]] blood they used in the casting. Only [[human]]s, [[demihuman]]s, and some [[humanoid]]s could be affected by this spell. True [[lycanthrope]]s and [[shapeshifter]]s were unaffected.\n\nFrom then on the victim would be forcefully transformed every month on the night prior to a [[Sel没ne (moon)|full moon]], on the night of the full moon, and on the night following the full moon. This lasted from moonrise to moonset, during which time the afflicted would be beset by a horrible bloodrage, urging them to commit murder and cause mayhem. In particular, these urges drew the afflicted towards those they had strong feelings for. The victim would retain no memories of their actions while transformed and could not transmit the condition to their victims.\n\nAfter the monthly three-night period there was a chance the victim could shake off the effects of the spell, but it was very difficult to accomplish. Otherwise the victim could attempt to have their condition fixed by ''[[remove curse]]'' or a ''[[wish]]'' spell.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, casting this spell required a [[material component]] in the form of blood from any mundane animal. Alternatively, a drop of blood from a true lycanthrope could be used.",
        "History": "Sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a wizard in [[Ravens Bluff]] by the name of [[Stefan]] used this spell on the traveling [[acrobat]] [[Tarkunian]]<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Friends in Low Places|10,18}} in retaliation for having ruined one of his [[illusion]]s. However, Stefan mistakenly believed he was casting ''[[shape change]]'' at the time, having been told as such by the sage he purchased the spell from. In any case, he turned Tarkunian into a [[wererat]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Friends in Low Places|18}} Being a devout [[Sel没nite]], Tarkunian went to the city's local [[Moonflame|Temple of Sel没ne]] for help, but he could not afford their fees for a casting of ''remove curse''. A month later a group of adventurers were contacted by the Sel没nite [[priestess]] [[Silverheart]] to help him on the day a full moon was going to occur.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Friends in Low Places|10-11}} Eventually the group tracked down Stefan who, after having learned of the true nature of what he had done, was very apologetic and offered to pay the cost for the ''remove curse'' spell."
