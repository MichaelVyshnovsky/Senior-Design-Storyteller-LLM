Ensnaring strike was a conjuration spell that gave a strike the chance of ensnaring a target with vines.
The target was covered with vines. If the target couldnt muscle their way out of the vines, they would be trapped in them. The vines would last up to a minute and damaged the victim every couple of seconds. If the target was large, then it would more easily break the vines hold.
If the spell was cast with a higher spell level, then the vines would hurt more.
Only a verbal component was needed for the casting of this spell.
