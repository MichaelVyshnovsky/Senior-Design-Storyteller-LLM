'''''Healing''''' was a type of [[giant]] rune that gave casters another way to create [[potion of healing|''potions of healing'']].

==Effects==
Whenever any liquid was first poured into an inscribed drinking vessel the ''healing'' rune would cause it [[Transmutation|transmute]] into a ''potion of healing''. If the rune was improperly inscribed than the liquid would instead transmute into a deadly [[poison]]. If this rune was extensively studied a second time, the caster would instead create a [[Potion of extra healing|''potion of extra-healing'']] or an even deadlier form of poison respectively.

Regardless of what the liquid had transmuted into it, it would revert to its previous state within an hour.

==Components==
Like most giant runes, it required no [[material component]]s to cast. The process of shaping this rune could take anywhere from one to eight hours and it needed to be inscribed upon a drinking vessel such as a cup, goblet, or bottle.
