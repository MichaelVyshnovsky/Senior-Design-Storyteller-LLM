Scourge of force was an evocation spell that conjured a number of tendrils of pure force energy within the casters hand, which lashed out against nearby creatures or foes.
When cast, this spell created between one to four scourge-like coils that struck one or multiple targets. The caster could assault a number of creatures in this manner, as long as they were within 30 (9.1 m) of one another, or focus the spell upon a single subject. 
This spell only required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast.
