'''''Scourge of force''''' was an [[evocation]] spell that conjured a number of tendrils of pure [[force]] energy within the caster's hand, which lashed out against nearby creatures or foes.

==Effects==
When cast, this spell created between one to four [[scourge]]-like coils that struck one or multiple targets. The caster could assault a number of creatures in this manner, as long as they were within 30' (9.1 m) of one another, or focus the spell upon a single subject. 

==Casting==
This spell only required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s in order to be cast.
