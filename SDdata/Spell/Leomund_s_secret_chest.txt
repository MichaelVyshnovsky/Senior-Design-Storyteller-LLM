Leomunds secret chest was a conjuration spell that allowed the caster to hide a chest.
To Zakharan mages, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as secret chest, and counted among the spells of the universal province.
On casting Leomunds secret chest, the caster could put a chest on the Ethereal Plane, keeping it safe there for sixty days at maximum.
The spell did not work on ordinary chests. The chest needed to fulfill some requirements. Its dimensions needed to be about 3 ft (0.9 m) by 2 ft (0.6 m) by 2 ft. It had to be an expensive well-crafted thing of at least 5,000 gp.
When the aforementioned sixty days ran past, there was an ever-increasing chance that the chest became lost forever. Even a wish spell could not remedy such an occurrence. However, a mundane search had a chance of finding the chest.
The chest could not be accessed from the phlogiston, but the spell still remained in effect for the duration.
The spell only required somatic and verbal components but also a focus in the form of small replica of the chest to be hidden away made of the same materials.
In the month of Eleasis, of the , the city of Ravens Bluffs Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild jointly declared it illegal to cast Leomunds secret chest within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the Soulstorm. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.
