'''''Leomund's secret chest''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] that allowed the caster to hide a chest.

To [[Zakhara]]n mages, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known simply as '''''secret chest''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].

==Effects==
On casting ''Leomund's secret chest'', the caster could put a chest on the [[Ethereal Plane]], keeping it safe there for sixty days at maximum.

The spell did not work on ordinary chests. The chest needed to fulfill some requirements. Its dimensions needed to be about 3 ft (0.9 m) by 2 ft (0.6 m) by 2 ft. It had to be an expensive well-crafted thing of at least 5,000 [[gp]].

When the aforementioned sixty days ran past, there was an ever-increasing chance that the chest became lost forever. Even a ''[[wish]]'' spell could not remedy such an occurrence. However, a mundane search had a chance of finding the chest.

The chest could not be accessed from the [[phlogiston]], but the spell still remained in effect for the duration.

==Components==
The spell only required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s but also a focus in the form of small replica of the chest to be hidden away made of the same materials.

==History==
In the month of [[Eleasis]], of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the city of [[Ravens Bluff]]'s [[Ministry of Art]] and [[Wizards Guild]] jointly declared it illegal to cast ''Leomund's secret chest'' within city limits due to a raging unnatural storm at the time called the [[Soulstorm]]. In addition to threatening arrest for those that broke this decree, it was declared that breaking this prohibition would result in a permanent expulsion from either organization.{{Cite trumpeter/2-8|2}}{{LCRB}}
