Frigid blade is a transmutation spell used by swordmages, particularly those who prefer to use fire and ice together in their spells. When a swordmage casts frigid blade they fill their weapon with icy power, freezing the flesh of its target and the air around it. When used on a creature, this causes the said creature to slow down substantially, the exact percentage dependent upon how durable the swordmages own flesh is. This effect only lasts a brief moment, though frigid blade can be recast at will and the power of the spell increases with the swordmages own.
