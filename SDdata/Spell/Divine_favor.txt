Divine favor was a evocation spell that asks the favor of a deity in combat.
The first version of the spell granted the caster a higher ability to successfully strike a enemy as well as increasing the damage of said hit. 
The post Second Sundering version of the spell granted radiant damage to the casters strikes.
Vocal and somatic components were needed for this spell, but the older version also required a divine focus.
