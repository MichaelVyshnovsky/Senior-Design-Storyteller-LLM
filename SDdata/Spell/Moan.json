        "mainbody": "Moan was a haunting cantrip that beginning wizards could learn. It created the illusory sound of a pitiful cry or a low wail that sounded as if it was nearby.\nThis cantrip was a variation of groan that produced the auditory illusion of a disembodied voice crying out within a radius of  from the caster.The original description of this spell in Dragon #60 used the 1-edition nomenclature 1\", meaning  indoors and  outdoors. This was simplified to the shorter range in Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four. The sound could be high and pitiful, perhaps like a child, or low and eerily mournful. The spot chosen for the emanation of the sound could be anywhere within the range, regardless of barriers, walls, or containers. Creatures in the vicinity that could be expected to hear the sound had a chance to resist the spell. If successful, they not aware of the illusion.\nThis cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster made either a high- or low-pitched sound while pointing at the location from which the cry was to emanate."
