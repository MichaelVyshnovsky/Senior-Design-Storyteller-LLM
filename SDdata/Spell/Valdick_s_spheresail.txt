Valdicks Spheresail was an immensely powerful conjuration spell used for sailing the crystal spheres.
This spell allowed the caster to effectively create a spelljammer from any vessel built for either sea or wildspace travel, by simply touching it. The spell took at least one minute to cast, and once the spelljammer was created, the enchantment was permanent, unless dispelled by another arcanist of at least the same power as the caster.
Spelljammers created by Valdicks spheresail did not need helms instead, the arcanist could simply will the vessel to move or stop as desired. Moreover, the motive power did not come from a helmsman. When within Realmspace or other crystal spheres where the goddess Mystryl held power, the spell drained divine power directly from her being. These speeds were double the maximum speeds attainable by the most powerful mage or priest sitting in a major helm.
If within the phlogiston, the spell instead siphoned magical energy from the cosmic gravitational forces of the destination crystal sphere. Similarly, the speeds attained were double those of a normal spelljammer. (Notably, scholars were unable to calculate the actual velocities involved, since it was impossible in the flow to measure the distances between spheres, because of the lack of visibility in the "rainbow ocean".)
Spheresail only required verbal components.
The spell was invented in  by the Netherese arcanist Valdick, who loved exploring wildspace but hated the long travel times involved.
