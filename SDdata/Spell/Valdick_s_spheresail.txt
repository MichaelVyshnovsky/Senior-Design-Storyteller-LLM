'''''Valdick's Spheresail''''' was an immensely powerful [[conjuration]] spell used for sailing the [[crystal sphere]]s.

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to effectively create a [[spelljammer]] from any vessel built for either sea or [[wildspace]] travel, by simply touching it. The spell took at least one minute to cast, and once the spelljammer was created, the enchantment was permanent, unless dispelled by another [[arcanist]] of at least the same power as the caster.

Spelljammers created by ''Valdick's spheresail'' did not need [[Spelljamming helm|''helms'']]; instead, the arcanist could simply will the vessel to move or stop as desired. Moreover, the motive power did not come from a helmsman. When within [[Realmspace]] or other crystal spheres where the goddess [[Mystryl]] held power, the spell drained divine power directly from her being. These speeds were double the maximum speeds attainable by the most powerful [[mage]] or [[priest]] sitting in a ''[[major helm]]''.

If within the [[phlogiston]], the spell instead siphoned magical energy from the cosmic gravitational forces of the destination crystal sphere. Similarly, the speeds attained were double those of a normal spelljammer. (Notably, scholars were unable to calculate the actual velocities involved, since it was impossible in the flow to measure the distances between spheres, because of the lack of visibility in the "rainbow ocean".)

==Components==
''Spheresail'' only required [[verbal component]]s.

==History==
The spell was invented in {{YearlinkConvert|2028|NY}} by the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Valdick]], who loved exploring wildspace but hated the long travel times involved.
