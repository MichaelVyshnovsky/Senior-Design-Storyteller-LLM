'''''Identify''''' was a [[divination]] [[spell]] that determined the features of a [[magic item]].

'''''Improved identify''''' was a more powerful version of the original spell, and thus it could only be cast by more experienced [[mage]]s. The improved spell determined all the magic properties of the item in question, as well as the object's name.

==Effect==
The caster instantly learned all properties and features of one selected magic item they could touch, such as how a function was activated and, if it contained charges, how many remained, as appropriate. It did not work on [[artifact]]s.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s and took a full hour to cast. Divine casters needed a [[divine focus]]. Arcane casters needed a [[material component]], namely a [[pearl]] worth 100 [[gp]] or more, which was crushed and stirred into [[wine]] using the feather of an [[owl]]. This infusion had to be drunk before beginning casting.

===Inscription===
According to the ''[[Book of the Silver Talon]]'', the ingredients for the [[ink]] used to inscribe ''identify'' into [[spellbook]]s were one ounce of [[giant octopus]] ink, a clump of the [[honey fungus]] plant, one bunch of [[fennel]], a fist-sized chunk of [[rose quartz]], one drop of [[holy water]], a single [[saffron]] plant, and a small flawless [[diamond]].

The honey fungus had to be plucked from rotting tree bark at night and immediately submerged in a [[silver]] vial full of the octopus ink and drop of holy water, the entirety of which was heated over a small fire. The rose quartz, fennel, and saffron were powdered with a mortar in a bowl of water and added to the vial as it was warming. This concoction was then shaken until properly mixed and cooled in a dark place. The leftover water was boiled in the bowl until evaporation, during which the diamond was to be powdered and combined within. This residue should then be added to the vial, which was sealed and stored under a rapid stream of water for six days before it could be used.

==History==
The [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Trebbe]] was given the credit for the creation of this spell in {{Yearlink|-2271}}. It was originally named '''''Trebbe's scry identify'''''.<ref>

It was an uncommon, though not unpopular, spell in [[Faer√ªn]] around [[1358 DR]].

==Users==
The [[magistrati]], specialty priests of [[Azuth]], were granted access to a special version of ''identify''.
