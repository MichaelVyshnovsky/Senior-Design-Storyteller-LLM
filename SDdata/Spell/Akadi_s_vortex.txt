'''''Akadi's vortex''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by specialty priests devoted to [[Akadi]], enabling them to summon a sphere of swirling wind similar to the ''[[winds of Akadi]]'' spell.

==Effects==
This spell was an enhanced version of the ''winds of Akadi'' spell. It summoned a {{SI|30|ft}} diameter sphere of air where the caster pointed that lashed out with lightning. However, instead of regular ''[[lightning bolt]]s'', ''Akadi's vortex'' struck with ''[[chain lightning]]'' capable of hitting multiple targets. The chain lightning would strike once every three minutes for a total of three ''chain lightning'' strikes. The cloud's final strike was a regular ''lightning bolt''. The caster was free to perform other actions while waiting to direct the next strike.

==Components==
This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast.
