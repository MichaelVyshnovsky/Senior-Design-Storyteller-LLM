'''''Spell fangs''''' was a [[spell]] that was first developed by the [[phaerimm]]s.

==Effects==
This spell was identical to ''[[toothed tentacle]]'' but more powerful. When cast, the spell caused a tentacle of whirling energy to appear at the hand of the caster. It then split into three smaller tentacles with mouths at the tips. These mouths were filled with razor-sharp teeth.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required [[material component]]s in the form of hair and three teeth from any creature.

==History==
This spell was originally created by the [[phaerimm]]s of [[Myth Drannor]].
