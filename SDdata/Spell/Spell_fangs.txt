Spell fangs was a spell that was first developed by the phaerimms.
This spell was identical to toothed tentacle but more powerful. When cast, the spell caused a tentacle of whirling energy to appear at the hand of the caster. It then split into three smaller tentacles with mouths at the tips. These mouths were filled with razor-sharp teeth.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components in the form of hair and three teeth from any creature.
This spell was originally created by the phaerimms of Myth Drannor.
