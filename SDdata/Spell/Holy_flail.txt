'''''Holy flail''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] and [[invocation]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Tempus]], enabling them to turn their [[holy symbol]] into an enchanted [[flail]].

==Effects==
This spell transformed the priest's holy symbol, or any non-bladed weapon, into a magical flail. The magical force forming the flail crackled with energy, making it much easier to strike and harm the caster's foes. The ''holy flail'' inflicted additional harm to foes of opposing moral stances to the caster with regards to good versus evil and law versus chaos.

If created from a holy symbol, the ''holy flail'' could only be wielded by priest of Tempus.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s the priests holy symbol and a pinch of powdered [[gemstone]] to cast.
