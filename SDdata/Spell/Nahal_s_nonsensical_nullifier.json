        "mainbody": "Nahals nonsensical nullifier was a wild magic abjuration spell used by wild mages. This spell was created by Nahal.\nThis spell masked the aura of the recipient, causing spells such as know alignment or detect evil to give a completely random reading for their true aura. The random aura for the recipient changed by the minute, so an astute observer might be able to see that something was awry.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small amount of egg yolk smeared into the hair of the recipient to cast."
