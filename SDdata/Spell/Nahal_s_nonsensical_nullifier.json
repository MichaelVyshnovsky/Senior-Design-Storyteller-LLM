        "mainbody": "'''''Nahal's nonsensical nullifier''''' was a [[wild magic]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[wild mage]]s. This spell was created by [[Nahal]].",
        "Effects": "This spell masked the aura of the recipient, causing spells such as ''[[know alignment]]'' or ''[[detect evil]]'' to give a completely random reading for their true aura. The random aura for the recipient changed by the minute, so an astute observer might be able to see that something was awry.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required a small amount of [[egg]] yolk smeared into the hair of the recipient to cast."
