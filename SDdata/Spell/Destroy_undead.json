        "mainbody": "Destroy undead was a powerful version of the arcane magic wizard spell hold undead.\nThis spell disintegrated corporeal undead whose life force was weaker than that of the caster. This spell had no effect upon incorporeal undead such as ghosts or wraiths.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component a priests holy symbol to cast.\nAn even more powerful version of this spell was capable as a power through the use of the artifact called the Ankh of Life from the Old Empires."
