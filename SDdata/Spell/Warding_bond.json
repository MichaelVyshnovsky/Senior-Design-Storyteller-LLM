        "mainbody": "'''''Warding bond''''' was a defensive [[spell]].",
        "Effects": "This spell was cast on a consenting individual. When cast, a bond forms between the targeted individual and the caster. As long as they remained within {{SI|60|ft}} from each other, the targeted individual was invulnerable to all damage. If the targeted individual is harmed, the caster was also harmed. The spell expired if the caster died or both individuals separated by more than {{SI|60|ft}}. The caster was also able to cancel the spell with a command.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a set of [[ring]]s made from [[platinum]]. The pair of rings had to have a value of at least 50 [[gp]] each. During the spell both the caster and the targeted individual wore the rings."
