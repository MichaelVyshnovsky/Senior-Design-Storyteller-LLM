Insanity, also known as descent into madness, was an enchantment spell that drove a subject permanently insane.
The enchanted creature was under the constant effect of a confusion spell, causing them to act erratically.
The insanity spell could not be removed with remove curse, but only with greater restoration, limited wish, miracle, and wish.
