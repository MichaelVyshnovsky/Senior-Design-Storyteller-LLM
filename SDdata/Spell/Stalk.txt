'''''Stalk''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Mielikki]], the Supreme Ranger, enabling them to mask their presence. Priests of [[Gwaeron Windstrom]], the Tracker,<ref> [[Eilistraee]], the Dark Maiden, also had access to this spell.

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to appear almost completely silent and invisible in rural settings. The caster's scent and heat signature were also masked, rendering them unseen to [[infravision]]. If they stayed still, they were utterly undetectable by natural senses to {{SI|10|yard|long=yes}}, but if they moved, then there was a slight chance they could be noticed by those with very sharp senses. The spell would expire in a number of minutes according to the caster's experience or until the caster made an attack.

==Components==
In addition to [[verbal component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a piece of dried [[lizard]] or [[chameleon]] skin and the priest's [[holy symbol]] to cast.

==History==
It was recorded in ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a holy text of the [[church of Mielikki]].<ref>
