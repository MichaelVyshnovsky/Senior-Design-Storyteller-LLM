        "mainbody": "Analyze Contraption was a spell for mechanical devices that could only be used by the gnome priests of Nebelun.\nBy touching any mechanical device they were unfamiliar with, the caster would receive a metal image of both the devices intended purpose and how it works. However, the spell would not determine for the caster how to operate the touched device.\nThis spell was known to work on any device, regardless of how complex it was. It was even known to work on unique artifacts such as the Apparatus of Kwalish, the Machine of Lum the Mad, and the Mighty Servant of Leuk-O.\nThis spell required a somatic and verbal component, as well as a material component in the form of the casters holy symbol."
