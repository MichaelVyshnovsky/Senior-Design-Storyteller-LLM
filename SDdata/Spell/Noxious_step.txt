Noxious step was an ability a skulker of Vhaeraun could learn.
A skulker of Vhaeraun usually tried to avoid notice but when a skulkers cover was blown, noxious step was the ability to be used. The skulker teleported away through shadows for a short distance and cloaked himself in foul-smelling green gas. Apart from giving a degree of concealment, this gas was poisonous in a selective way enemies in the gas received physical damage from the gas and when the skulker was more skilled, also suffered a temporary loss of offensive capability.
