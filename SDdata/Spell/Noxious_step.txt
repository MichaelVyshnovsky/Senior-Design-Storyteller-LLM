'''''Noxious step''''' was an ability a [[skulker of Vhaeraun]] could learn.

==Effect==
A skulker of [[Vhaeraun]] usually tried to avoid notice but when a skulker's cover was blown, ''noxious step'' was the ability to be used. The skulker teleported away through shadows for a short distance and cloaked himself in foul-smelling green gas. Apart from giving a degree of concealment, this gas was poisonous in a selective way: enemies in the gas received physical damage from the gas and when the skulker was more skilled, also suffered a temporary loss of offensive capability.
