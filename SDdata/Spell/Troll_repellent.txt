'''''Troll repellent''''' was an [[arcane magic|arcane]] [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created a smell that was quite offensive to [[troll]]s.

==Effects==
This spell created a greenish mist that smelled terrible to most creatures. Trolls found the smell unbearable, forcing them to flee the area. The slightest breeze would cause the mist to dissipate, making it difficult to use the spell outdoors. The caster needed to maintain concentration, otherwise the mist would vanish.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a piece of ragweed, some troll dung, and an open flame to cast.

==History==
This spell was quite rare outside of its use by [[orc]] [[witch doctor]]s in [[Faer√ªn]].
