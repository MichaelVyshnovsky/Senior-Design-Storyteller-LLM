Troll repellent was an arcane evocation spell that created a smell that was quite offensive to trolls.
This spell created a greenish mist that smelled terrible to most creatures. Trolls found the smell unbearable, forcing them to flee the area. The slightest breeze would cause the mist to dissipate, making it difficult to use the spell outdoors. The caster needed to maintain concentration, otherwise the mist would vanish.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a piece of ragweed, some troll dung, and an open flame to cast.
This spell was quite rare outside of its use by orc witch doctors in Faer√ªn.
