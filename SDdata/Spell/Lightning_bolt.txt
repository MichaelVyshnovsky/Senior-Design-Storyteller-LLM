'''''Lightning bolt''''' was an [[evocation]] spell that caused arcs of lightning to emanate from the caster's fingertips.

==Effects==
The searing bolt of electricity traveled in a straight line emanating from the caster. Older versions of this spell struck all in its path, while newer versions were aimed at a particular creature and then, with skill, could be forked to hit one or two other creatures.

The bolt from the older versions was powerful enough to blast a wooden door to cinders, set fire to combustible materials, splinter a hand-depth of stone, or melt soft metals such as [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[lead]], or [[bronze]].

A well-centered ''lightning bolt'' blast could interfere with magics of open ''[[gate]]s'', closing them after rippling through the fabric of the spell with electric feedback.

==Components==
The pre-[[Spellplague]] and post-[[Second Sundering]] versions of this spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and material components including a tuft of fur and a small rod made of [[amber]], [[rock crystal|crystal]], or glass.

To inscribe this spell on a magic scroll, arcane scribes often used [[ink]] made from the horn of a [[behir]].

==History==
The spell was attributed to the [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Volhm]] in {{Yearlink|-1968}} and was originally called ''Volhm's bolt''.

==Notable uses==
The wizard [[Parwyyd Hanifar]] used a forked version of ''lightning bolt'' to blast a number of [[kenku (winged)|kenku]]s and [[gargoyle]]s in aerial combat in [[1357 DR]].{{Cite comic/Day of the Darkening|17}}

The [[1358 DR|following year]], during the [[Time of Troubles]], [[Shar|a false avatar]] of [[Sel√ªne]] cast ''lightning bolt'' at [[Kyriani]] in the kitchen of [[Castle Waterdeep]], but the bolts were caught and reflected by pots and pans.{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|17}}

In [[1362 DR]] a [[harper]] wizard [[Brenna Graycloak]] was able to cast a version of a ''lightning bolt'' in a fray of battling a [[darkenbeast]] using [[sulfur]] as a component.
