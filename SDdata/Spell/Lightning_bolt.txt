Lightning bolt was an evocation spell that caused arcs of lightning to emanate from the casters fingertips.
The searing bolt of electricity traveled in a straight line emanating from the caster. Older versions of this spell struck all in its path, while newer versions were aimed at a particular creature and then, with skill, could be forked to hit one or two other creatures.
The bolt from the older versions was powerful enough to blast a wooden door to cinders, set fire to combustible materials, splinter a hand-depth of stone, or melt soft metals such as gold, silver, copper, lead, or bronze.
A well-centered lightning bolt blast could interfere with magics of open gates, closing them after rippling through the fabric of the spell with electric feedback.
The pre-Spellplague and post-Second Sundering versions of this spell required verbal, somatic, and material components including a tuft of fur and a small rod made of amber, crystal, or glass.
To inscribe this spell on a magic scroll, arcane scribes often used ink made from the horn of a behir.
The spell was attributed to the Netherese arcanist Volhm in  and was originally called Volhms bolt.
