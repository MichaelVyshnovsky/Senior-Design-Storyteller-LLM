        "mainbody": "Heartcall was a spell developed by Majinhime. It found the targets true love.\nThe spell indicated approximate direction and distance to the targets true love, if it existed. If the true love of the subject was in a different plane, only indications as to the nature of the plane (Transitive, Inner, Outer, demiplane) would be obtained. Sometimes, it simply failed, perhaps because it was not yet the time for them to meet.\nBesides verbal and somatic components, the potion required a glass disc and a spool of red thread.\nThe spell was developed by Majinhime, inspired by her travels through Kozakura. It was very rare outside of soothsaying businesses."
