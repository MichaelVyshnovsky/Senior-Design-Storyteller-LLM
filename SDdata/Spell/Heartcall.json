        "mainbody": "'''''Heartcall''''' was a spell developed by [[Majinhime]]. It found the target's true love.",
        "Effects": "The spell indicated approximate direction and distance to the target's true love, if it existed. If the true love of the subject was in a different plane, only indications as to the nature of the plane (Transitive, Inner, Outer, demiplane) would be obtained. Sometimes, it simply failed, perhaps because it was not yet the time for them to meet.",
        "Components": "Besides [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, the potion required a glass disc and a spool of red thread.",
        "History": "The spell was developed by [[Majinhime]], inspired by her travels through [[Kozakura]]. It was very rare outside of soothsaying businesses."
