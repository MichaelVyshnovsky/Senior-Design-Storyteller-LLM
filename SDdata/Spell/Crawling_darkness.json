        "mainbody": "Crawling darkness was a divine evocation spell that conjured a shroud of dark appendages that surrounded the caster.\nWhen this spell was cast, the cleric was enveloped in shadowy, semi-corporeal tentacles. Their body was obscured by these dark appendages, though they could still see with complete clarity.\nThe shroud moved with the casting cleric and offered them some effects and protects as per a few other spells feather fall, water walk and slay insect. In the latter case, the tentacles killed any swarm of insects they encountered and then dissipated.\nThe specifications of this spell were revealed by the Sharran relic Gorothirs Girdle.\nIn addition to verbal, somatic, and material components. The latter of which included a bit of spiderweb, a small amount of soot, and a tentacle taken from any sea animal."
