'''Swan ships''' were elegant and resilient [[spelljammer]]s designed by [[halfling]]s and used by numerous other spacefaring races.

==Description==
Swan ships were light and sturdy vessels with exceptionally large cargo holds. For that reason, they were popular among merchants, particularly [[human]]s. The high quality of these vessels granted them the rare privilege of being considered acceptable by [[elf|elves]], who frequently acquired swan ships to add to their own fleets.

The ship required a minimum crew of twelve to operate, and could support a maximum of 32 human-sized creatures without compromising its air supply. If crewed entirely by halflings or similarly sized creatures, the ship could support up to 64 individuals, but required instead a minimum of sixteen to operate.

Swan ships were also extremely versatile. They could be landed on water or, if necessary, crash-landed on solid ground, even on terrains considered unsuitable for landing, such as beaches and grasslands, while still remaining space-worthy. Despite being light vessels, some swan ships could be modified for war by carrying heavier armament. Aggressive crews such as [[mind flayer]]s and [[giff]] slavers were known to sometimes take advantage of the seemingly innocent appearance of a swan ship.
