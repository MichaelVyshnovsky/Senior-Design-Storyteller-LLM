Swan ships were elegant and resilient spelljammers designed by halflings and used by numerous other spacefaring races.
Swan ships were light and sturdy vessels with exceptionally large cargo holds. For that reason, they were popular among merchants, particularly humans. The high quality of these vessels granted them the rare privilege of being considered acceptable by elves, who frequently acquired swan ships to add to their own fleets.
The ship required a minimum crew of twelve to operate, and could support a maximum of 32 human-sized creatures without compromising its air supply. If crewed entirely by halflings or similarly sized creatures, the ship could support up to 64 individuals, but required instead a minimum of sixteen to operate.
Swan ships were also extremely versatile. They could be landed on water or, if necessary, crash-landed on solid ground, even on terrains considered unsuitable for landing, such as beaches and grasslands, while still remaining space-worthy. Despite being light vessels, some swan ships could be modified for war by carrying heavier armament. Aggressive crews such as mind flayers and giff slavers were known to sometimes take advantage of the seemingly innocent appearance of a swan ship.
