'''''Detect charm''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s, [[druid]]s and [[shugenja]].

==Effects==
This spell allowed a caster to determine if a creature was under the influence of a [[charm]]-based spell, such as ''[[suggestion]]''. Depending on the caster's skill level, they were able to detect what specific charm spell the creature was influenced by. If the creature was under the influence of multiple charm spells, the caster was only able to determine the creature was charmed, but not by which spells. The caster was able to check up to ten creatures before the spell expired. ''[[Undetectable charm]]'' was the reverse of this spell. When cast, it hid all charms cast on a creature for up to a full day.

==Components==
This spell required only  [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
