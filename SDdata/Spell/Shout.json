        "mainbody": "Shout was an evocation spell that allowed a caster to shout devastatingly.\nOn casting shout, the caster gave a shout that deafened those within a 30 ft (9 m) cone of the caster. This shout was such that it physically harmed people within its path. It was much more effective at destroying brittle objects or crystalline creatures.\nShout required only verbal components. The version circulating in the Realms before the Year of Wild Magic additionally required a miniature cone of bull or ram horn as well as small amounts of honey and citric acid as material components.\nThe spell was invented at the edge of Netheril in 3095 NY (âˆ’764 DR) by the evil arcanist Xanad, then consequently named Xanads shout."
