        "mainbody": "Avasculate was a powerful necromantic spell that forced its target to expel blood or other vital bodily fluids.\nWhen the avasculate spell was cast, a stream of necrotic energy blasted out of the casters hands towards the target at  distance or greater. The stronger the spellcaster was, the further the avasculate could be flung. When hit with these magics, the target became violently ill, painfully purging blood or other vital fluids out of their body through the skin. Such loss of blood left the target in a tremendously weakened state and stunned for six seconds. Those creatures with impressive fortitude still suffered the blood loss but were not stunned by the pain and gore.\nThe spell called for verbal and somatic components to be cast.\nYears before the , Arduelth, a young and promising Rashemaar witch embarked on her dajemma and returned home bearing a powerful enchanted periapt. It was one of the several powerful and evil magical items she learned to create. Arduelth wanted to fight Thays evil magics with a similar tool. Despite hathrans reluctance, Arduelth was granted the hathran status, only to be executed later when her fellow witches realized the true evil these secret magics brought to Rashemen. Arduelths periapt of the Lost Witch possessed several magical properties, including acts to the rare and malicious avasculate spell."
