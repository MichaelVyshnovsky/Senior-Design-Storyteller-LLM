'''''Animal horde''''' was a special [[divine magic|divine]] [[conjuration]] [[quest spell]] from the [[animal sphere|animal]] and [[summoning sphere]]s that summoned a group of animals to the caster.

==Effects==
The number of animals summoned was determined by the skill of the caster, but could be upwards of a literal horde of creatures. The casting [[priest]] was aware of the type and quantity of animals within the spell's area of effect. Furthermore, they could decide the type and quantity of animal that was summoned from those available. Summoned animals would not fight against each other even if they were natural enemies, focusing instead on providing aid to the caster. The animals would return to their lairs when the spell expired.

==Components==
This spell did not require [[spell component]]s of any kind.

==History==
This spell was used by [[druid]]s who served [[Moander]] during the height of ancient [[Netheril]]'s power.
