Spell phylactery was a transmutation spell used by clerics. This spell originated from Mystra the goddess of magic.
This spell created a set of triggering conditions for a scroll so the spell written on the scroll would be instantly cast upon the caster when the conditions were met. For this to work the spell on the scroll needed to be a spell that was memorized by the caster.
The scroll used for spell phylactery needed to be bound to the casters arm or forehead in some manner. Only scrolls with effects that directly affected the caster could be used.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the scroll in question to cast.
