'''''Spell phylactery''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s. This spell originated from [[Mystra]] the goddess of magic.

==Effects==
This spell created a set of triggering conditions for a [[scroll]] so the spell written on the scroll would be instantly cast upon the caster when the conditions were met. For this to work the spell on the scroll needed to be a spell that was memorized by the caster.

The scroll used for ''spell phylactery'' needed to be bound to the caster's arm or forehead in some manner. Only scrolls with effects that directly affected the caster could be used.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required the scroll in question to cast.
