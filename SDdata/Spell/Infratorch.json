        "mainbody": "Infratorch was an alteration spell that allowed the caster, along with anyone nearby, to see as if they possessed infravision.\nWhen this spell was cast, a mage imbued a piece a wood with magic that cause it to act as if it were a magical torch that conferred infravision upon others. It did not radiate light or heat but did grant its beneficial effects to anyone within 15 (4.6 m).\nIn addition to the verbal component, this spell required a single piece of wood, such as a staff, stick or even a snuffed-out torch."
