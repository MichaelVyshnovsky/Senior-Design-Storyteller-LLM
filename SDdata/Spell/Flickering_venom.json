        "mainbody": "'''''Flickering venom''''' was an [[invocation]] used by some [[warlock]]s, which could be used to infect an enemy with deadly [[poison]]. When a warlock casted ''flickering venom,'' they conjured a [[dagger]]-like weapon of venomous poison which they then shot into a creature within {{SI|25'|'\"|long=yes}} of them. The deadliness of the dagger was largely determined by the warlock's charisma but dark pact warlocks also gained a benefit from their intellect, which allowed them to stretch the reach of their attack from up to {{SI|50'|'\"|long=yes}}. ''Flickering venom'' was more easily cast than some spells, but required a short rest of a few minutes between castings regardless.",
