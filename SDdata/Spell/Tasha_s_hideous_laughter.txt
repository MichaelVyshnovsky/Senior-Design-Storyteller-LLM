Tashas hideous laughter, also known as Tashas uncontrollable hideous laughter, was an enchantment spell that caused its target to fall into crippling bouts of laughter.
The target of Tashas hideous laughter perceived everything as extremely funny and laughed so uncontrollably that it became impossible to even stand up. The effect of the spell lasted for up to one minute, as long as the spellcaster kept concentrating on the spell or until the target managed to shake off the effect. Ending the spells effect was also easier if the target was injured in any way.
The spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The materials required were a small feather that needed to be waved in the air and tiny tarts that needed to be thrown in the targets direction.
The spell was attributed to the Oerthian archmage Iggwilv, during an early time in her career when she was known as Tasha.
By the 1360s DR it was yet rarely found in the magical communities of both Faer√ªn and Zakhara. To Zakharans, always reluctant to acknowledge ajami names and accomplishments, the spell was known as uncontrollable hideous laughter, and counted among the spells of the universal province.
By the late 15 century DR, the spell was commonly used throughout Waterdeep as a security measure against burglars, usually coupled with a glyph of warding cast on rooftops.
The spell was commonly employed by nilbogs. It was also known to some cloud giant spellcasters and could be innately cast by powerful eladrin who resided in the Feywild.
Additionally, Tashas hideous laughter was favored by cultists of Yeenoghu and was considered a signature spell of his followers.
