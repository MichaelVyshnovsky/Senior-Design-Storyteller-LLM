'''''Tasha's hideous laughter''''', also known as '''''Tasha's uncontrollable hideous laughter''''', was an [[enchantment]] [[spell]] that caused its target to fall into crippling bouts of laughter.

==Effects==
The target of ''Tasha's hideous laughter'' perceived everything as extremely funny and laughed so uncontrollably that it became impossible to even stand up. The effect of the spell lasted for up to one minute, as long as the spellcaster kept concentrating on the spell or until the target managed to shake off the effect. Ending the spell's effect was also easier if the target was injured in any way.

==Components==
The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The materials required were a small feather that needed to be waved in the air and tiny [[tart]]s that needed to be thrown in the target's direction.

==History==
The spell was attributed to the [[Oerth]]ian [[archmage]] [[Iggwilv]], during an early time in her career when she was known as Tasha.{{Cite dragon/359/Unsolved Mysteries of D&D|30}}

By the 1360s [[DR]] it was yet rarely found in the magical communities of both [[Faer√ªn]]<ref> and [[Zakhara]].{{AQ-time}} To Zakharans, always reluctant to acknowledge [[ajami]] names and accomplishments, the spell was known as '''''uncontrollable hideous laughter''''', and counted among the spells of the [[Universal (province)|universal province]].

By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the spell was commonly used throughout [[Waterdeep]] as a security measure against burglars, usually coupled with a ''[[glyph of warding]]'' cast on rooftops.

The spell was commonly employed by [[nilbog]]s. It was also known to some [[cloud giant]] spellcasters and could be innately cast by powerful [[Noble eladrin|eladrin]] who resided in the [[Feywild]].

Additionally, ''Tasha's hideous laughter'' was favored by cultists of [[Yeenoghu]] and was considered a signature spell of his followers.
