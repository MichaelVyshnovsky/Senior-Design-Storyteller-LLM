'''''Lizard limbs''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[divine]] spellcasters of the [[Malatran Plateau]] who did not worship gods. Instead, their magics were granted by the spirits.

==Effects==
When the spell took effect, the caster gained the ability to shed one or two limbs without suffering any harm. It allowed the caster to escape being trapped or pinned down with only minor consequences as the torn limbs grew back. The limbs began growing back one hour after the shedding, and it took a full 24 hours for it to complete. The spell affected arms, legs, tails, and wings.

==Components==
''Lizard limbs'' only required a [[verbal component]] to be cast.
