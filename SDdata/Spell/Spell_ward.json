        "mainbody": "'''''Spell ward''''' was a powerful [[Divine magic|divine]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Mystra]], enabling them to become completely immune to a series of spells.",
        "Effects": "This spell granted complete immunity to the caster or a touched subject to a single named [[wizard]] spell for each degree of spell difficulty. A ''spell ward'' offered protection against a single form of normal and magical harm as well. This spell did not protect the subject against diseases. If cast upon themselves, the caster could transfer the ''spell ward'' to another recipient for the duration of the spell by touching them. This transfer caused a small bit of physical harm to the caster.",
        "Components": "This spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast."
