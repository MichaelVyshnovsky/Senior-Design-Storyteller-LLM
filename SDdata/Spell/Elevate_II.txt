Elevate II was a spell unique to Maztica. This was a more powerful version of elevate I.
The spell was able to levitate objects of considerable weight. The object had to be on a plumalitter. The maximum amount of weight and the height it could be elevated to was determined by the casters ability. The caster was able to easily move the floating plumalitter around, and it remained still in light winds.
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
