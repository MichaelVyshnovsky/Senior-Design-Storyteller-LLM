'''''Elevate II''''' was a spell unique to [[Maztica]]. This was a more powerful version of ''[[elevate I]]''.

==Effects==
The spell was able to levitate objects of considerable weight. The object had to be on a ''[[Talisman of pluma|plumalitter]]''. The maximum amount of weight and the height it could be elevated to was determined by the caster's ability. The caster was able to easily move the floating ''plumalitter'' around, and it remained still in light winds.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components.
