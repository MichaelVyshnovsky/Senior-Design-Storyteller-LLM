Power word, sicken, was an arcane spell from the enchantment school of magic.
The spell was able to make one creature sickened.
The spell only worked on creatures under a certain high degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the spellcaster.
The spell required only a verbal component, which was the uttering of the power word itself.
The spell could be learned and cast by both sorcerers and wizards.
