'''''Power word, sicken''''', was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] from the [[enchantment]] [[school of magic]].

==Effects==
The spell was able to make one creature sickened.

The spell only worked on creatures under a certain high degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the spellcaster.

==Components==
The spell required only a [[verbal component]], which was the uttering of the power word itself.

==Usage==
The spell could be learned and cast by both [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s.
