        "Effects": "There were several versions of this spell. The later version could be cast at any creature (living or [[undead]]) within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and rendered them blind or deaf for up to one minute. The target continually attempted to resist the magic of this spell, and the stronger its constitution, the more likely it would recover before the minute was up. If cast at a higher level, more creatures could be targeted.\n\nThe older version of this spell had a much longer range (a minimum of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}) and the target only got one chance to resist or was struck blind or deaf permanently. This magically-induced condition could only be reversed by a ''[[remove blindness or deafness]]'' spell, or more powerful magics. Only living creatures were affected by this spell.\n\nThere also existed two older separate versions based on illusion magic, where one could only inflict '''''blindness''''', the other '''''deafness'''''.",
        "Components": "The different versions of this spell required only a verbal utterance to cast, except ''deafness'', where also gestures and [[beeswax]] were needed.",
        "History": "The ''deafness'' spell was developed by [[Netheril|Netherese]] arcanist [[Cragh]] of [[Northreach]], himself deaf since birth, in [[-1999 DR|1860 NY (−1999 DR)]] as '''''Cragh's deafness'''''. It was his only spell.<ref> ''blindness'' was an invention of his prolific colleague [[Smolyn]] in [[-1964 DR|1895 NY (−1964 DR)]], then accordingly named '''''Smolyn's blindness'''''.\n\nBy the [[1360 DR|1360s DR]] both spells were uncommon among magic-users in [[Faerûn]]<ref> and widespread among those in [[Zakhara]].<ref><ref>{{AQ-time}}\n\nIn [[1372 DR|1372 DR, the Year of Wild Magic]], a combined version came into use in the magical community, quickly replacing the two more restrictive spells."
