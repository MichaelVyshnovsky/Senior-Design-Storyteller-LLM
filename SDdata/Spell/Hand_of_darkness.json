        "mainbody": "'''''Hand of darkness''''' was an [[arcane]] [[spell]] used by the [[drow]] designed to negate light.",
        "Effects": "Upon casting, ''hand of darkness'' deprived light sources within 30 feet (9.1 meters) of a designated spot of their ability to emit light. For example, if the light source happened to be a [[torch]], the torch stopped shedding light under the spell, but continued to emit heat and burn its fuel.\n\nLight sources brought into the area under a ''hand of darkness'' spell, for example by conjuring it up with a ''[[light]]'' or similar spell, or by more mundane means, were instantly negated.\n\nThe spell could be prematurely ended with ''[[dispel magic]]''. However, the [[abjuration]] would also dispel any magical light source in the area. In the case of continual magical light sources, such as a glowing magical sword, the ''dispel magic'' would only temporarily suppress the light-shedding effect.",
        "Components": "''Hand of darkness'' required somatic and verbal components, and material components in the form of a lump of coal or handful of ash, a small black glass or stone sphere, and a scrap of black cloth, fur, or hide.",
        "History": "Strong light was uncomfortable for [[drow]] and inhibited their ability to concentrate. ''Hand of darkness'' was used to combat this problem as it shut out light but not their ability to use [[infravision]]."
