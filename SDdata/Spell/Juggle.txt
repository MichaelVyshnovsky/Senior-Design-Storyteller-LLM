'''''Juggle''''' was a common spell used by [[geisha]]. The spell was sometimes used by [[wu jen]] and was extremely rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
When cast, the spell created small spheres of fire, ice, water, and light. A skilled caster instead created small glowing daggers. These were juggled by the caster and disappeared on contact with anything other than the caster's hands. These items could also be thrown, acting as a missile, causing minimal damage to a target. To cast this spell, the caster was required to be skilled in juggling. 

==Components==
The spell required [[somatic component|somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s.
