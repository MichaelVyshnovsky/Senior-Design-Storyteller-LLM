Juggle was a common spell used by geisha. The spell was sometimes used by wu jen and was extremely rare outside Kara-Tur.
When cast, the spell created small spheres of fire, ice, water, and light. A skilled caster instead created small glowing daggers. These were juggled by the caster and disappeared on contact with anything other than the casters hands. These items could also be thrown, acting as a missile, causing minimal damage to a target. To cast this spell, the caster was required to be skilled in juggling. 
The spell required somatic and verbal components.
