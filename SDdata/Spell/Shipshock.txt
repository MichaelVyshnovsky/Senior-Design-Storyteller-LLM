Shipshock was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate.
This spell protected ships from underwater attacks. Once cast, the spell lay dormant until a creature other than a natural animal touched the hull. When triggered, the spell released a blast of electricity that affected every living thing within 100 feet (30.5 m) if they were underwater. The spell was spent after one discharge.
This spell required a small silver rod to cast.
