        "mainbody": "'''''Tenser's lift''''' was a [[ritual]] that allowed the caster to conjure a large [[magic]]al platform that they could move with mental commands.{{Cite dragon/366/Ritually Speaking|32}}",
        "Effects": "The spell summoned a pearlescent white hovering square platform that was {{SI|30|feet}} on a side. The caster could command the platform to move with their thoughts, although it was significantly faster at moving vertically than horizontally. If the caster dismissed the spell, it would not dissipate until it had gently descended to the nearest solid ground.{{Cite dungeon/193/Shards of Sel√ªne|19}}",
        "Components": "''Tenser's lift'' entailed [[material component]]s worth 125 [[gold pieces]].",
        "History": "''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the [[Bregan D'aerthe]] captain [[Xalbyn]] carried at least one scroll of ''Tenser's lift'', as well as the material components necessary to cast it, during his assignment in [[Neverwinter]]. This was likely always intended to be used to reach and infiltrate the [[Shard of Night]], a mysterious hovering tower about which Bregan D'aerthe wanted to learn more."
