'''''Arrowflight''''' was a [[pluma]] [[spell]] unique to [[Maztica]] used to help archers.

==Effects==
This spell increased the ability to shoot [[arrow]]s of (depending on the power of the plumaweaver) one or several persons: It allowed them to shoot the projectiles twice as far as usual, and also slightly increased the severity of the wounds inflicted.

==Components==
Aside from [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, a small amount of downfeather shaped like the fletching of an arrow was needed.
