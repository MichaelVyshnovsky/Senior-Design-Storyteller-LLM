'''''Bane of Yondalla''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s of [[Yondalla]].
 
==Effects==
When cast on a target, this spell had a similar effect as if the targeted creature had been struck by a ''[[staff of withering]]''. The targeted creature aged about ten percent of its natural lifespan. If the caster was strong enough and targets a specific limb of a target, the limb became shriveled and rendered useless. The spell had no effect on creature who did not age.
 
==Components==
In addition to [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components, this spell required [[material component]]s, the [[holy symbol]] of the caster, and a dried vine. The vine was consumed by the spell.
