        "mainbody": "'''''Sinsabur's baleful bolt''''' was a [[necromancy]] [[spell]] that conjured a bolt of dark energy that enfeebled any creature caught within its path.",
        "Effects": "The bolt of energy shot forth from the caster's fingertips and extended out for over 100 ft (30.5 m). It severely weakened any living being it struck and diminished their vitality. If they survived the spell's effects, the victim slowly recovered from these effects over the course of days.",
        "Casting": "The casting of this spell required only [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s."
