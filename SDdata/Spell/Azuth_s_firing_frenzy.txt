Azuths Firing Frenzy was a divine evocation spell that discharged three volleys of magic missiles.
When this spell was cast, the caster shot forth three separate barrages of magic missiles, each of which included five projectiles. While each barrage targeted a different person or creature, the missiles of each barrage struck the same target.
In rare cases, it was possible for firing frenzy to inadvertently discharge magical items carried by those it struck.
The specifications of this spell were contained within Vorthryns Archivir.
This spell required verbal and somatic components in order to be cast.
