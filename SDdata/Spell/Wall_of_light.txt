'''''Wall of light''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that created an opaque wall of extremely bright light.

==Effects==
The spell created a straight wall up to {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} long, {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} tall and {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} thick out to a range of {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}}. The wall could appear in any orientation and did not need to rest on any surface, so floating ''walls of light'' in vertical, horizontal, or diagonal positions were possible.

The wall was so bright that any creature caught within it risked getting burned and being afflicted with temporary blindness. The damage inflicted by the spell increased as the caster grew more powerful.

Additionally, the wall could consume part of itself to shoot beams of burning light at the caster's command, that had a range of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. Each beam consumed {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of wall. The spell lasted for up to 10 minutes, as long as the caster kept concentrating, or until it was entirely converted into fired beams.

==Components==
The spell required [[verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s The material required was a small [[hand mirror]].
