        "mainbody": "Ghostharp was an uncommon spell used by bards and wizards.\nThis spell was cast onto an object. When cast, the spell would search the area within  of the object for the most recent song that was played or sung within the previous day. When the spell detected a song, its melody recorded onto the object. When the caster spoke the spells verbal command, \"Play\", the object replayed the music. The music continued playing until the caster spoke \"Stop\" or the spell expired. The spell was not able to record conversations, and its recording of a song was not perfect. It was unable to replicate magical effects or cast spells.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the casters flesh needed to be touching a small harp for the spell to work.\nThis spell was commonly used by the Seven Sisters and some Harpers."
