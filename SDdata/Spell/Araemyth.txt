The '''''araemyth''''' was an effect created through a mighty [[spell]], and one of the most awesome and destructive spells known to the [[elves]] of [[Cormanthyr]].
{{quote|''Few who've witnessed a spell battle forget the very old saying among [[human]]s: "When mages duel, honest folk should seek hiding places far away." Though mantles and araemyths make elven wizardly duels more a matter of anticipation and slowly unfolding complexity than human struggles, 'tis still a good idea to be at a safe distance when sorcerers make war. Out of the realm, for instance.''|[[Antarn]] the Sage, from ''[[The High History of Faerunian Archmages Mighty]]'', ''circa'' [[1366 DR]]{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|170|9}}}}

==Effects==
The ''araemyth'' took a couple of minutes to set up, but once it did, it created a sphere of light that would transform other [[spell]]s cast at it, and [[enchanted]] items placed on it, into rays of magical energy with the most awesome destructive power. There were no known magical or non-magical barriers capable of enduring the force of the ''araemyth''. The sphere was not subject to ''[[dispel magic]]''.

==History==
Araemyths were used by the rebels besieging [[Mythanthar]] in [[Cormanthyr]] after the naming of [[Elminster]] as an [[armathor]] in the {{yearlinkName|241}}.
