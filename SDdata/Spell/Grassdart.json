        "mainbody": "'''''Grassdart''''' was a [[spell]] used by [[divine]] spellcasters of the [[Malatran Plateau]] who did not worship gods, instead their magics were granted by the spirits.",
        "Effects": "When the spell was cast, it transformed [[grass]] within {{SI|10'|'\"|long=yes}}, usually two to seven blades, into hardened, sharp, and dangerous weapons. Some taller types of grass, like that found in the savannah of Malatra, transformed into [[javelin]]-like weapons, while shooter grass types were turned into [[dart]]-like weapons. The hardened grass of an appropriate size could be crafted into quality [[arrow]]s with added fletching. When the spell was cast on still-growing plants, they transformed into a deadly bed of sharp blades. The grass affected by the spell remained tough for one minute.",
        "Components": "The spell's [[material component]]s were suitable blades of grass that were transformed in the process."
