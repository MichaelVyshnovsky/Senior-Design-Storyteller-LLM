Ice dagger was an evocation spell used by arcane spellcasters in the Realms.
The spellcaster would shape a dagger-shaped shard of ice, which would then launch itself unerringly at a target within close range and explode upon impact, causing cold injuries to the target and others in an area within a 5-foot (1.5-meter) radius, if they could not evade.
This spell required both verbal and somatic components, in addition to a material component in the form of a few drops of water that must have originated from melted ice.
