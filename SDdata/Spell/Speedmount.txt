Speedmount was an alteration spell that increased the speed of a single horse, or other animal that was ridden as a mount.
For the duration of the spell, the affected creature could move at the twice the rate it was typically capable. The duration of speedmount was a matter of seconds, but increased depending on the skill and experience of the caster.
This spell was somewhat unique to the elves of Evermeet. The specifications of its casting were a well-kept secret of island realm.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required the use of a single horseshoe.
