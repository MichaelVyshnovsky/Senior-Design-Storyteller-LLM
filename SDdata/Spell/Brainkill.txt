Brainkill was an arcane spell from the school of necromancy that allowed a wizard to erase a memory from the targets mind by destroying a portion of their brain.
This spell could be used to remove all memory of a person, place, or period of time of up to one year from the targets mind. If the target was able to resist the spell they would only experience a painful headache that lasted for several hours.
This spell required only verbal components to cast.
This spell was found within the Book of Shadows, a tome based upon the oration of the necromancer Nebt Bhakau of Zakhara.
