'''''Gambler's luck''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[wu jen]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. The spell was very rare outside Kara-Tur.

==Effects==
A wu jen cast this spell when they gambled or took part in a game of chance. The wu jen had no way to control the spell, or the spell's outcome on the game. There was a 40% chance the outcome would not work in the wu jen's favor, and a 60% chance it would. While a negative outcome would not affect the game itself, the wu jen would be over-taken by an obsessive need to gamble, taking reckless wagers and betting far too much. 

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, the spell required a [[material component]], a small statue of [[Hsing Yong]], the god of luck.
