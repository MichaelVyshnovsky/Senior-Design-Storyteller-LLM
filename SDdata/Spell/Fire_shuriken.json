        "mainbody": "Fire shuriken was an evocation spell known to the wu jen of Kara-Tur in the 1350s DR, though it was also available to assassins in the 1370s DR. It let them create and hurl shuriken of fire.\nThe spell created spinning pinwheels of magical fire, shaped like shuriken and sharp as a razor. The caster also gained the skill to use these shuriken as well as a trained warrior of the same experience, and they would not burn their hands. With a flick of the casters hand, they were thrown toward the target, sparks flying off them. On striking, the flames and sharp edges of the early fire shuriken both caused injury or damage, before they dissipated in a puff of multi-colored smoke, which briefly obscured a victims sight. The later fire shuriken only burned, not cut, and would not set fire to anything flammable. Initially, the caster could create one, two, or three fire shuriken as they gained power, but this later increased to nine or to six.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic and material components. The material component was a tiny shuriken coated in sulfur and pine sap. The somatic component involved quick hand motions.\nFire shuriken was among the spells recorded in the Scrolls of Ha Rahni, written down by the wu jen Ha Rahni between Shou Year 2180 (930 DR) and Shou Year 2212 (962 DR).\nFire shuriken was common among wu jen of the late 1350s DR, being known to the korobokuru wu jen Wutambi, the monkey hengeyokai wu jen Taichi, wu jen agents of Tu Lung, wu jen pirates, and Daisake Mayazato and the wu jen ninja Moonlight, Smoke, and Snake.\nFire shuriken could be cast and hurled at will by lu nat spirits and go-zu oni and me-zu oni."
