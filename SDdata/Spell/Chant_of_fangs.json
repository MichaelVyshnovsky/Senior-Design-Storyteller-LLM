        "Components": "This spell required [[Somatic component|somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s, along with the tooth of a wild, predatory mammal. Per its name, the verbal component consisted of loud chanting.",
        "History": "This specifications of ''chant of fangs'' were inscribed within the [[Malar]]ite [[relic]], the ''[[Book of Fangs and Talons]]''."
