Laerals gesture was an alteration wizard spell developed by Laeral Silverhand.
This spell allowed the caster to cast a previously memorized medium- to lower-power spell by performing a complex physical gesture. It was quite useful if a wizard found themselves without their spell components.
This spell only required verbal and somatic components to cast.
Laeral created this spell after she was attacked while bathing and not in the vicinity of her spell components.
