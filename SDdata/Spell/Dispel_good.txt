Dispel good was an abjuration spell that worked exactly like dispel evil except it affected good spells and creatures instead of evil ones.
The effects of this spell were the same as dispel evil except the aura surrounding the spellcaster was dark and made of quivering unholy energy.
Verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. The newest version also used the casters (un)holy symbol or divine focus, while the older versions required (un)holy water.
