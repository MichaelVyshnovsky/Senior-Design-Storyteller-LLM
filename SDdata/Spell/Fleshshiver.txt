Fleshshiver was a necromancy wizard spell.
This deadly spell was targeted at any creature the caster could see. If they were unable to resist the spell the target was stunned and bones began to break within its body. For humanoids the broken bones began with the appendages and ended with the neck bone which would prove fatal.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components a bone which was broken during the casting to cast.
