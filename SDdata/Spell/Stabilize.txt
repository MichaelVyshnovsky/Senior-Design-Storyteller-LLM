'''''Stabilize''''' was a [[wild magic]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[wild mage]]s.

==Effects==
This spell negated the chaotic effects within wild magic regions. With the caster's immense concentration during casting, ''stabilize'' allowed the caster and all creatures within {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} to use magic normally without fear of triggering a [[wild surge]]. The safe area followed the caster if they moved around. Furthermore, a wild surge triggered outside of range of this spell would not pass into the safe area.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.
