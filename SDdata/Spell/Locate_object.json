        "mainbody": "'''''Locate object''''' was a [[divination]] spell that let one sense the direction to an object.",
        "Effect": "''Locate object'' allowed the caster to sense the location of an object that was stated. The stated object could be something general like \"a ladder\", which would cause the caster to sense a ladder within range. If the caster wanted to state a specific item, the caster needed to be able to visualize it in his or her mind as well as having actually seen it in the past. [[Lead]], even a thin sheet of it, blocked the spell's detection and was therefore a means by which to hide things from this spell.\n\nThe reversed form, ''obscure object'', shielded an object from magical divination.",
        "History": "The spell was attributed to [[Netherese arcanist]] [[Zahn]] in {{Yearlink|-923}} and was originally called ''Zahn's location''.",
