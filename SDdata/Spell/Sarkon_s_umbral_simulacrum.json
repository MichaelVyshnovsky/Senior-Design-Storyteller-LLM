        "mainbody": "'''''Sarkon's umbral simulacrum''''' was a [[shadow magic]] [[spell]] that allowed a mage to create an exact duplicate of a person from [[shadowstuff]].{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4338|6}} It was presumably created by [[Sarkon]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Name\">This is assumed from the name. Owing to the shared names, it is likely that Sarkon also compiled the Sarkonagael.\n\nThe only known source of the spell was the [[Sarkonagael]], a tome of shadow magic. The book was highly sought after and was recovered twice for large rewards by the [[rogue]] [[Jack Ravenwild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]].{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|2849}} At one point, he cut the spell's four pages from the book to prevent it being used against him.<ref>{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|3260|10}}"
