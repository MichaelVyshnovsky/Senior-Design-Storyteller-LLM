        "mainbody": "Absorption, or absorbtion(sic)\nThis powerful spell allowed the caster to both absorb and redirect most incoming spells. The spells effect were nullified and the energy of the spell was stored within the caster. The caster was able to use this stored energy to cast a memorized spell without the need to re-memorize it to cast again, allowing the caster to cast the same spell twice in a short period. The spell allowed the caster to store the energy of up to ten spells. If the caster did not use all the stored energy by the time the spell expired, it was lost. The caster was able to temporarily suspend the spell so they could receive certain spells such as healing spells. Earlier versions of the spell absorbed more spell power in a consistent manner.\nSpells that were more powerful than the ward was able to absorb were reduced in power to a fraction, depending on how much absorption was left those whose effects could not be fractioned might simply fail, which was more likely the more of their power that was absorbed. Earlier versions did not risk breaking partly absorbed spells, instead effectively bolstering resistance against the remainder.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required a material component, an expensive amulet with a value of at least 1,000 gp. The glowing amulet acted as the vessel for the stored spell energy and must remain on the caster for the duration of the spell.\nThis spell was known to be used by wizards of the Cult of the Dragon."
