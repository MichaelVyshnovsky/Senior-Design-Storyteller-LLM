'''''Frigid darkness''''', is an [[invocation]] of the [[evocation school]] used by many [[warlock]]s, particularly those of the [[Warlock#Star Pact Warlock|star pact]]. When a warlock casts ''frigid darkness'' he or she summons to a spot within fifty feet of him or herself a pool of freezing shadow. These shadows cling to any creature unfortunate enough to be within their grasp, bestowing them with a sample of the dark cold of the night sky. The shadow not only injures a warlock's foes, but distracts them and obscures their vision for a moment, giving both the warlock and his or her allies a short-lasting advantage against the victim. Those of the star pact summon shadow of such power that they are able to reduce the effectiveness of an enemy's [[armor]], at least for a brief moment. ''Frigid darkness'' is not enormously complex and a warlock need only rest a few minutes or more before casting the spell a second time.
