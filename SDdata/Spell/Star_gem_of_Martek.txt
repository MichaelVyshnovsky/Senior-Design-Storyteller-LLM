The Star Gems of Martek were five gems that the wizard Martek was said to have imbued with an enchantment to retrieve his Sphere of Power, but would actually resurrect him. These gems were known as the Star of Mo-Pelar, the Star of Aga-Pelar, the Star of Khan-Pelar, the Star of Shah-Pelar, and the Star of Melos-Pelar.
The Star of Aga-Pelar was a huge midnight black star sapphire with an inner asterism of pure white.
The Star of Mo-Pelar was a fist-sized opal. 
The Star of Khan-Pelar was an enormous clear crystal.
The Star of Shah-Pelar was a huge faceted ruby.
The Star of Melos-Pelar was a fist-sized, faceted amethyst of the deepest purple. It was said to be the shape of either a ball, or an egg.
The Star of Mo-Pelar had the same powers as a gem of true seeing. The Star of Melos-Pelar had the power to point the way to Marteks Tomb, if placed in the monolith in Medinat Muskawoon.
The wizard Martek had foreseen the need for the gems in order to completely defeat Khalitharius, and thus hid them throughout the Raurin. The wizard had enchanted his own sanctum so that as soon as all the gems were brought there, hed be brought back to life, to defeat the efreet.
The Star of Mo-Pelar, he gave to the pharaoh Amun-Re. The Star of Shah-Pelar, he gave to an unnamed pharaoh of the desert, before it was stolen by Badr Al-Mosak. The Star of Aga-Pelar, he used to personally bind Khalitharius, giving it then to the Lord of Pazar to keep the efreet prisoner. Martek hid the Star of Melos-Pelar in the ruins of Medinat Muskawoon, and the Star of Shah-Pelar in an abandoned temple beneath the Oasis of the White Palm.
