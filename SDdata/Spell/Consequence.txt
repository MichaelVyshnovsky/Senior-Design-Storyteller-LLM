Consequence was a divine spell from the numbers and divination spheres that allowed the caster to determine the future consequences of a recent event.
The caster could use this spell to determine the effect on a grand scheme by a recent event. Information such as whether or not major or minor implications would occur as a result of the event could be gleamed. Casting the spell twice within a full day would reveal the same results.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as a material component some platinum coins or dice which were cast during the casting. The coins or dice needed to be worth at least 1,000 gp and were not consumed during the casting.
This spell was favored by holy strategists of the Red Knight.
