        "Effects": "This spell lasted until sundown or until the unit was faced with a situation that challenged their morale, whichever came first. Multiple castings of this spell did not stack, i.e., no more than one ''courage'' spell could be active on a unit at a time.",
        "Components": "In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small cube of [[cast iron]]."
