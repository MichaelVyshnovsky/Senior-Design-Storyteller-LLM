        "mainbody": "Courage was an enchantment spell that crusaders and battle clerics could use to boost the morale of up to 200 individuals organized in a fighting unit.\nThis spell lasted until sundown or until the unit was faced with a situation that challenged their morale, whichever came first. Multiple castings of this spell did not stack, i.e., no more than one courage spell could be active on a unit at a time.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small cube of cast iron."
