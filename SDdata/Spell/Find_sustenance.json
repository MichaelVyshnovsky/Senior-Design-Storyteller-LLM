        "mainbody": "Find sustenance was a spell used by clerics of Fenmarel Mestarine.\nWhen cast, this spell aided the caster in finding food and water. While the spell was in effect, the caster gained a instinctive sense where to find edible food and clean water. Once the caster had found enough food and water, the spell expired. As the caster skill level increased, they were able to use this spell to sustain multiple individuals.\nThis spell required verbal and somatic components."
