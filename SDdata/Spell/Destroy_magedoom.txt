Destroy magedoom was a divine conjuration spell used by specialty priests devoted to Azuth, enabling them to combat magedooms. Azuth only granted this spell to high-ranking priests who served him well.
This spell bypassed a magedooms immunity to magic, instantly destroying the creature if it was unable to resist the spell. The magedoom still suffered a great deal of harm when resisting the spell which may even kill it anyway. This spell had no effect if cast upon other creatures.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol and a magic item to cast. The magic item was consumed during the casting.
