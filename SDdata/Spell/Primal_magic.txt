'''Primal magic''' was a form of [[magic]] associated with both the natural world of the [[Prime Material plane]] and the [[Spirit World]]. It was considered one of the primordial forces of nature, one that served as a bulwark against influences and threats from other [[planes of existence]].

==Nature of Primal Magic==
Nearly all aspects of the natural world were somehow linked to primal magic, including all manner of animals, vegetation, weather patterns, and even individual [[planet]]s. The nature of primal magic was believed to change in form and essence depending on the land and world through which it passed.

Primal magic was considered 'untamed' and even alien by denizens of planes beyond the Prime Material, most notably the [[Feywild]]. When primal magic manifested near ''[[fey crossroad]]s'' it became more 'pure' in nature, Paradoxically, some scholars believed that primal magic was the force of the [[multiverse]] that bound the Feywild and the Prime together.

The power of each individual's [[truename]] originated from the essence of primal magic.

==Practitioners==
Primal magic was often associated with those that made their home in the wilderness and tended to nature, such as [[druid]]s, [[shaman]]s, and [[barbarian]]s. It took exceptional self-discipline and foresight to wield this power; failure to do so often inadvertently caused grievous harm to the caster and anyone else nearby.{{Cite dragon/383/Devotees of the Gibbous Moon: Secrets of the Beast Form|37}}

The specifics of wielding primal magic were often overlooked by non-practitioners. To them, all forms of primal magic were uniform and indistinguishable in their practice.

===Creatures===
While scholarly works stated that primal magic was foreign to the Feywild,{{Cite dragon/392/Class Acts: Fey Wardens|26-27}} For instance, [[dryad]]s were fey creatures that possessed the distinct ability to wield primal magic in defense of their home-trees.

[[Shifter]]s preferred to dwell in lands that were steeped in primal magic.{{Cite dragon/410/Howl at the Moon|2}}

===Organizations===
The practice of primal magic was especially notable among the [[shapeshifter]]s of [[Dambrath]], the [[Tuigan]] of the [[Hordelands]], the [[hengeyokai]] of the [[Ama Basin]],{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|2-4}} and the [[half-orc]]s of the [[Green Moss]] tribe of [[Many-Arrows]] in the [[Spine of the World]].{{Cite dragon/429/Winning Races: Half-Orcs of the Many-Arrows Tribe|13}}
