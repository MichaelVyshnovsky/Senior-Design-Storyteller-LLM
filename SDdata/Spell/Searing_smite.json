        "mainbody": "Searing smite was a spell used by paladins.\nAfter the spell was cast, the casters melee weapon was covered in white-hot flames. The flames did not harm the caster. The spell increased the damage inflicted by the casters weapon. The spell was vulnerable to water. If the weapon was submerged or a water-based action was used against the caster successfully, the spell expired. The amount of extra damage inflicted by this spell was determined by the casters skill level.\nThis spell required only a verbal component."
