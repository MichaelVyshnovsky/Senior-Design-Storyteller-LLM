'''''Dispel fog''''' was an [[arcane]] [[abjuration]] spell that removed mist and fog from an area around the caster.

==Effects==
This spell took one minute to cast and cleared a circular area with a radius of at least 50 ft (15 m). More experienced casters could increase that radius. Any natural or magical fog or mist in the area was permanently destroyed and the area remained clear for at least 50 minutes (again, longer for more experienced casters), after which it could be replaced by generating more or merely blowing in from elsewhere.

Creatures in mist form, such as [[vampire]]s, caught in the area of effect were either forced to transform out of mist form, or take a significant amount of damage.

==Components==
This spell required only [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[Somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.

==History==
This spell was associated with the pirates roaming the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].
