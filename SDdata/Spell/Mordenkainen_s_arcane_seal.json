        "mainbody": "'''''Mordenkainen's arcane seal''''' was a powerful [[spell]], presumably developed by [[Mordenkainen]] of [[Oerth]], that warded a space against entry.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}\n{{quote|It's protected by the arcane seal of Mordenkainen.|Sofina, not elaborating}}",
        "Description": "It was marked by three glowing red magic circles on the entrance to the warded area: one small, one large, and one small, arranged vertically.The three circles appear similar to the three rings of the hilt of Mordenkainen's two-bladed sword.",
        "Effects": "Reputedly, the spell could make a vault impenetrable to entry by physical means and all but the most powerful [[magic]]al means. It seemed possible for a ''[[portal]]'', such as produced by a ''[[hither-thither staff]]'', to bypass the seal, provided one end of the ''portal'' was moved physically inside the warded area.\n\nThe seal could be broken by powerful magic like ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction]]''.",
        "History": "In the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}}, [[Sofina]], the [[wizard]] advisor to Lord [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] of [[Neverwinter]], cast ''Mordenkainen's arcane seal'' on the treasure vault of the refurbished [[Castle Never]] to protect the valuables that should be held within. Forge offered use of this vault to his wealthy guests from other cities, such as [[Din Caldwell]] and [[Porb Piiradost]], who'd come to Neverwinter to bet big on the [[High Sun Games]] and had brought their riches with them. This was a problem for the thieves [[Edgin Darvis]], [[Holga Kilgore]], [[Simon Aumar]], and [[Doric]], who had to seek nothing less than the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]'' in order to break through it.\n\nUltimately, during the start of the Games, Simon used the ''helmet of disjunction'' to break the ''Mordenkainen's arcane seal'' and enter the vault. But it was all for naughtâ€”the treasure had already been relocated."
