'''''Dweomerdeny''''' was a [[wizard]] [[spell]] from the school of [[enchantment]].

==Effects==
This spell permanently banished a specific spell from the mind of a spellcaster. The caster needed to touch the target while speaking the incantation. ''Dweomerdeny'' did not affect targets who did not use magic.

The spell selected by the caster to be erased needed to be memorized by the target when ''dweomerdeny'' was cast, otherwise the spell did nothing. In addition to erasing the spell from the target's repertoire, it also prevented them from learning that exact spell again in the future or from using [[scroll]]s of the same spell.

==Components==
This spell only required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components to cast.
