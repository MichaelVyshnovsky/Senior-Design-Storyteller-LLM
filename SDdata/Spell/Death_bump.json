        "mainbody": "Death bump was a spell unique to Zakhara, the Land of Fate. This spell was used primarily by ghul lords.\nThis spell returned a target to life who had just experienced a killing blow. The spell accomplished this by transferring the pain from the killing blow from the target to a nearby person or creature. The recipient of the transferred damage could be a willing or unwilling target.\nIf the spell succeeded, the dead target returned to life with minimal health.\nThis spell did not require physical components to cast."
