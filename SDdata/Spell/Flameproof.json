        "mainbody": "Flameproof was an abjuration spell that granted a subject immunity to fire.\nWhen cast, this spell fully protected the recipient from normal fires and offered limited protection from magical ones. The recipient became completely immune to normal fire, lava, etc. Breath weapons, or other fire-related attacks, from creatures and fire-based spells did not cause as much harm to the recipient.\nThis spell could not be combined with any other spell or magical item that granted resistance to fire.\nWhen cast upon an inanimate object, the spell made the object completely immune to all forms of fire both normal and magical.\nThis spell required a bit of candle wax to cast.\nThe spell was once unique to the mages of Zakhara, the Land of Fate."
