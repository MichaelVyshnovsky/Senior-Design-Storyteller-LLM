        "mainbody": "'''''Temple of the gods''''' was a [[conjuration]] [[spell]] used by [[cleric]]s that summoned a temporary temple dedicated to a [[deity]].",
        "Effects": "The spell created a large temple made of pure magical energy that occupied the area up to a square {{SI|120|ft|long=yes}} on a side. The temple could be summoned in any unoccupied visible area within a range of 120 feet. It simply shimmered into existence.\n\nThe temple could have any appearance desired by the caster, within the parameters of having an interior encased by walls, a ceiling, and a door. The interior, which exuded a [[perfume]] of burning [[incense]], could have as many windows as the caster determined and any level of illumination. The door could only be opened or closed by creatures designated by the caster.\n\nThe temple opposed one type of creature determined by the caster, chosen among [[celestial]]s, [[fey]], [[fiend]]s, or [[undead]]. Creatures of the chosen type could only enter the temple if they resisted the spell's repulsion, and even so, had their every effort hindered as if under the effect of a ''[[Bane (spell)|bane]]'' spell. [[Divination]] sensors targeting the area or people inside were blocked within the temple.\n\nThe structure of the temple extended into the [[Ethereal plane]], and its magical material could not be traversed by any means. It was immune to ''[[dispel magic]]'' and even ''[[antimagic field]]''. The only spell capable of destroying a ''temple of the gods'' was ''[[disintegrate]]''.\n\nThe spell lasted for 24 hours, after which the temple disappeared. If the spell was cast once every day for a full year at the same place, the temple became permanent.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[verbal component|verbal]], [[Somatic component|somatic]], and [[material component]]s. The material required was the cleric's [[holy symbol]], which needed to be worth at least 5 [[gp]]."
