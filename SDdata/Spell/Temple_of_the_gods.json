        "mainbody": "Temple of the gods was a conjuration spell used by clerics that summoned a temporary temple dedicated to a deity.\nThe spell created a large temple made of pure magical energy that occupied the area up to a square  on a side. The temple could be summoned in any unoccupied visible area within a range of 120 feet. It simply shimmered into existence.\nThe temple could have any appearance desired by the caster, within the parameters of having an interior encased by walls, a ceiling, and a door. The interior, which exuded a perfume of burning incense, could have as many windows as the caster determined and any level of illumination. The door could only be opened or closed by creatures designated by the caster.\nThe temple opposed one type of creature determined by the caster, chosen among celestials, fey, fiends, or undead. Creatures of the chosen type could only enter the temple if they resisted the spells repulsion, and even so, had their every effort hindered as if under the effect of a bane spell. Divination sensors targeting the area or people inside were blocked within the temple.\nThe structure of the temple extended into the Ethereal plane, and its magical material could not be traversed by any means. It was immune to dispel magic and even antimagic field. The only spell capable of destroying a temple of the gods was disintegrate.\nThe spell lasted for 24 hours, after which the temple disappeared. If the spell was cast once every day for a full year at the same place, the temple became permanent.\nThe spell required verbal, somatic, and material components. The material required was the clerics holy symbol, which needed to be worth at least 5 gp."
