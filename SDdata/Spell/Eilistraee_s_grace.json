        "mainbody": "Eilistraees grace was a transmutation spell used by Silverhair Knights.\nWhen cast, the caster summoned the might and grace of Eilistraee, enveloping themselves in a divine radiance. This radiant energy manifested as a silvery glow that encompassed the casters body, casting light over a  radius and significantly hindered the casters ability to remain concealed.\nWhile the spell was in effect, the casters agility and mobility was temporarily increased. In addition, the divine energy imbued the casters touch attacks and any melee weapons they employed, aligning them with the forces of good. This allowed the weapons to bypass damage reduction as if they were good-aligned.\nThis spell only required a verbal component."
