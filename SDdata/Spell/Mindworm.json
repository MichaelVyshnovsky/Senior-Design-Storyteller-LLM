        "mainbody": "Mindworm was a spell of Nergals creation that stole memories.\nA subject under the effects of mindworm could be forced to recall a memory, which was shared with the caster however, upon being recalled, the memory was gone from the targets mind.\nThe archdevil Nergal employed that spell on Elminster Aumar upon capturing him, while the wizard was lost in Avernus, meaning to steal the secrets of silver fire from the mages mind.\nNergal kissed Elminster before telling him to \"taste\" the mindworm. The kiss may have been a part of the casting, or an infernal taunt."
