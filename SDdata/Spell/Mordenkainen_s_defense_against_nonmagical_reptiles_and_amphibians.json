        "mainbody": "Mordenkainens defense against nonmagical reptiles and amphibians was a spell that improved the chances of surviving an attack by reptiles and amphibians.\nThis spell allowed the caster or a targeted creature to have increased ability against all amphibians and reptiles. This included dinosaurs and giant versions of the species. This spell had no effect against magical amphibians and reptiles, such as dragons.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, the spell required material components, a piece of snake skin and a desiccated leg of a frog. These were to be placed in a pouch made from tough leather."
