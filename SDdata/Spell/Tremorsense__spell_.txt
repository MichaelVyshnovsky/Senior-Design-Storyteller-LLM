'''''Tremorsense''''' was a [[transmutation]] [[spell]] that temporarily gave the caster [[tremorsense]].

==Effects==
On casting ''tremorsense'', the caster gained tremorsense that had a range of up to 30 feet (9 meters).

==Components==
''Tremorsense'' required [[somatic]] and [[verbal component]]s. When an arcane caster tried to cast the spell, a bit of skin from a creature with natural tremorsense was required as focus, while divine casters needed their [[divine focus]].

==History==
Creatures from the [[Underdark]] used ''[[boots of tremorsense]]'', which could only be built by people with access to the ''tremorsense'' spell.
