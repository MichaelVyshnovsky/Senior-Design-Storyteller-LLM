        "mainbody": "'''High Forest scouts''' were guardians of the [[High Forest]] and the bane of the wood's enemies. Roaming the confines of the enchanted forest that they called home, they made common cause with the many fantastical creatures that inhabited it while combating the threats that would do them harm, such as the [[yuan-ti]] of [[Najara]] to the south or the [[demon]]ic servitors of revived [[Netheril]]. To those who would do the forest harm, High Forest scouts were as deadly ghosts, haunting would-be foes from the trees and driving them off.\n\nHigh Forest scouts were notable for the fact that, unlike most [[ranger]]s, they learned to wield [[arcane magic]] to complement their martial training.",
        "Abilities": "In order to survive within the dangerous High Forest rangers who took the path of the wood's deadly scouts required special training. Many of these new abilities were partially or fully [[magic]]al in nature, often as a way of combating the often supernatural enemies the Forest faced. For instance, in a way that was particularly detrimental to [[fey]] such as [[fey eladrin|eladrin]], High Forest scouts learned to prevent enemies from [[teleportation|teleporting]]. Following the [[Spellplague]], many also learned to focus their training on combating the [[plaguechanged]] or [[spellscar]]red, gaining intuitive knowledge of the creatures' weaknesses. In a manner that was less supernatural, High Forest scouts were also able to cross forested terrain with considerably greater ease than most.\n\nUnlike most experienced rangers of the period between the Spellplague and the [[Second Sundering]] who exclusively used martial [[exploit]]s, High Forest scouts learned to use [[spell]]s instead, which due to their background in archery were mostly focused on the use of a [[bow]] or, much more rarely, other ranged weapons. ''[[Argent arrow]]'' was an example learned early on, which allowed High Forest scouts to enchant their ammunition with the ability to throw a target through the [[Feywild]]. In a wholly different manner, ''[[binding arrows]]'' caused vines to sprout from the spots where a scout's arrow landed, binding the scout's enemies in place. In order to aid allies, High Forest scouts could also cast ''[[unrestricted movement]]'', which allowed the scout's friends to move unimpeded through difficult terrain."
