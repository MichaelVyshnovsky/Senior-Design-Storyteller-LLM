        "mainbody": "'''''Call faithful servants''''' was a [[conjuration]] spell that summoned up to four [[celestial]]s to the caster's side.",
        "Effect": "Up to four [[lantern archon]]s, [[coure]] [[celestial eladrin|eladrin]], or [[musteval]] [[guardinal]]s were called to the location of the caster, where they remained to serve for up to one year as guards, soldiers, spies, or toward whatever other holy purpose the caster desired.\n\nThe spell could be cast multiple times, but there was a limit to the maximum number of celestial servants at one time, depending on the power of the caster. If the spellcaster summoned servants over this maximum, the longest-serving celestials were returned to their home plane.",
        "Components": "The spell required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s. In addition, the caster must have abstained from casting conjuration spells for at least three days prior to casting the spell.\n\nWith the exception of Harper paragons, it was not possible for a non-celestial to cast this spell successfully.",
