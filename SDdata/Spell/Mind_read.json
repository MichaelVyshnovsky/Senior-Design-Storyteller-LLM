        "mainbody": "Mind read was a divine divination spell from the thought sphere that resembled an augmented version of the wizard spell ESP.\nMind read allowed the caster to read the surface thoughts of any creatures within range, but also allowed them to probe deeper into the mind of a single target. Information gathered about the target creature included its race and potentially its skill set if applicable. This spell was more useful when used against intelligent targets as reading the mind of an animal would only relay jumbled thoughts.\nThis spell required only verbal and somatic components to cast.\nThe Scepter of Mystra, a relic of the Mystran faith, could cast the mind read spell."
