Cloak of insanity was a  spell used by drow. It was very rarely used by other races.
This spell protected a casters mind from psionic attacks and all spells that work on the mind. The spell achieved this by using insane thoughts on the surface of the casters mind. While this spell was in effect, the caster was unable to cast or memorize additional spells but was able to use magical items, read a spellbook or consume potions. The caster remained vulnerable to limited wish and wish spells. When the spell expired, there was a slight chance the caster would become confused. 
This spell required only verbal and somatic components.
