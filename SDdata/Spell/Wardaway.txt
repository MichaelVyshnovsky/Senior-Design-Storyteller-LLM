'''''Wardaway''''' was both an offensive and defensive [[wizard]] [[spell]].

==Effects==
This spell allowed the caster to hurl a disjointed magical force at a single target. The shimmering magical force could dodge and evade objects in order to reach the intended target, but once cast the target could not be changed.

A struck target was surrounded by the shimmering magical force and had their movements hindered in additional to the physical damage from being struck. These effects lasted for two minutes. A running target was instantly halted in their tracks, allowing the spellcaster a few precious moments to make their next move.

All [[undead]] and animated constructs such as [[golem]]s were immune to this spell.

==Components==
In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components, this spell required a small [[human]] hand sculpted from either clear rock crystal or [[moonstone]] to cast.
