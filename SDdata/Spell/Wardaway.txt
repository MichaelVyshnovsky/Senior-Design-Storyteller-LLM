Wardaway was both an offensive and defensive wizard spell.
This spell allowed the caster to hurl a disjointed magical force at a single target. The shimmering magical force could dodge and evade objects in order to reach the intended target, but once cast the target could not be changed.
A struck target was surrounded by the shimmering magical force and had their movements hindered in additional to the physical damage from being struck. These effects lasted for two minutes. A running target was instantly halted in their tracks, allowing the spellcaster a few precious moments to make their next move.
All undead and animated constructs such as golems were immune to this spell.
In addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a small human hand sculpted from either clear rock crystal or moonstone to cast.
