Horn was a haunting cantrip that neophyte wizards could learn. It simulated the sound of a single note from a horn with some control over volume, apparent distance, and steadiness.
This cantrip produced a single horn-like note that could be clearly heard from  to  away, depending on the volume chosen by the caster. The amount of echo and the perceived distance could also be chosen, and the note could be made to waver with tremolo. With practice, a wizard could imitate a horn well enough that it was indistinguishable from the real thing. The duration of the note was determined by how long the caster held their mouth in the correct shape.
This cantrip required verbal and somatic components to cast. The caster first softly hummed a note to pick the pitch of the horn sound. The horn sounded when the caster opened their mouth in an O-shape and curled the fingers of one hand around their mouth. The volume was varied by opening or closing the gap formed by the circle of fingers and tremolo could be added by shaking the fingers.
This cantrip was one of three unique cantrips recorded in Glanvyls Workbook, penned by the relatively unknown Glanvyl of Scornubel in the 11 century DR.The three cantrips described in Dragon #100 were replaced with the cantrip spell when the 2-edition Pages from the Mages was published. The Wizards Spell Compendium Volume Four describes all the 1-edition cantrips as examples of what you could do with cantrip.
