Either the enemy recognises they are a threat, and kills them swiftly, or their curiosity leads them to combust while experimenting with the limits of magic.|[[Minthara Baenre]]}}<br/>\nWizards were generally the best-respected of all arcane spellcasters. They usually maintained a measure of discipline that was uncommon among [[sorcerer]]s or [[warlock]]s, whose very nature made them comparatively unruly. Not all wizards were deserving of this reputation however, and wizards were corrupted by their power or otherwise turned to evil ways.\n\nPrior to the [[Era of Upheaval]], wizards as a whole were associated with [[Mystra]], Goddess of Magic and manifestation of The Weave. That closely held association was altered for a time following Mystra's death during the [[Spellplague]]. [[Shar]], Goddess of Darkness orchestrated Mystra's death and attempted to supplant her arcane plexus with the [[Shadow Weave]], but was ultimately unsuccessful. During the [[Second Sundering]], both Mystra and the Weave returned to [[Toril]], and the relationship between them and arcane practitioners was restored.",

In order to [[Wizards#Spell Preparation and Casting|cast most spells]], wizards studied their spellbook before they planned to rest, sleep, Once their spells were prepared, wizards could access and cast them to the extents their mental capacity would allow. \n\nWizards were entirely dependent upon their spellbooks to prepare new spells each day, and could barely tap into the Weave without them. The only spells that wizards could cast without preparation were simple [[cantrip]]s.",

These implements concentrated the arcane power in a spell, increasing its effectiveness. All wizards had a degree of specialization in implements, preferring one kind over another. Some took a liking to orbs, which they used to increase the duration of their spells' effects. Others preferred using wands to enhance their accuracy or staves to defend themselves. The most basic spells available to wizards were known as [[cantrip]]s and required little skill on the part of the wizard in order for them to be cast. Such spells were typically small tricks of magic such as creating a light source, a sound, or moving a small object telekinetically.",
            "Familiars": "{{Fq|text=How is a [[devil]] like a wizard? Both bleed until they don’t.|source=[[Azuth]] god of wizards}}\n\nA [[familiar]] was a normal animal that gained new powers and became a magical beast when summoned to service by a wizard or a [[sorcerer]]. Each wizard shared an empathic bond with their familiar and could even channel the casting of certain spells through them. Many types of animals could be called upon as familiars, from everyday [[cat]]s and [[raven]]s, to more exotic species such as [[beguiler]]s and [[starsnake]]s.",
            "Learning the Art": "Mastering, and even learning the basics of the Art was a long and arduous process. The most straightforward method was apprenticeship under experienced mages. However, it was not an easy task. It required thoroughly learning and using spells starting from the most basic spells of everyday utility, such as ''[[mending]]'' or ''[[message]]''. Adventurers and other thrill and fortune seekers trained in the Art by successfully reading out [[spell scroll]]s or by methodically learning, copying, and replicating arcane writings, all the time slowly improving their experience. Lastly, learning the Art was accessible through natural-born strong \"wild talent\" or a \"Gift\" that aided mages-to-be in the learning process.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-11-01 - Mastering the Art}}\n\nYouths of humble means rarely became wizards as the learning the Art was an expensive aspiration. This one of the reasons why wizardly profession was so scarce in the Realms. Those of talents and luck became apprentices, or drudges to mages, while those in the Forest Kingdom of Cormyr tried to demonstrate their \"Gift\" to the infamous [[Wizards of War]] or another well-known arcane organization. An alternative to service to apprenticeship were the Harpers who covertly scouted the Realms for goodly youths with the \"wild talent\".{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-11-02 - Potential Young Mages}}"

In particular, they learned most new spells by seeking out magical writings and copying them into their [[spellbook]]s. Unlike [[bard]]s or sorcerers, the wizardly method allowed them to master any number of permissible spells once they find them, assembling a broad and versatile arsenal of power.
