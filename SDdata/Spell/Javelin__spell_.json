        "mainbody": "Javelin was an uncommon evocation spell of the southern magic tradition. \nWhen cast, the spell caused a javelin to become filled with energy. When thrown, the javelin struck a target without error within the spells range, which was 80 yard (73 meter). \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required a material component, an ordinary javelin."
