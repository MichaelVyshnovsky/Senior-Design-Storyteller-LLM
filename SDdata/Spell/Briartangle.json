        "mainbody": "Briartangle was a divine alteration spell used by priests devoted to Silvanus, enabling them to convert shrubs into dense briars.\nThis spell transformed normal shrubbery or undergrowth into extremely thick and thorny briars. The briars would scratch and harm any creature trying to force their way through, though the damage was lessened for anyone wearing armor or having tougher skin. Wizards caught within a briartangle could not cast any spells that involved a somatic component. Cloth and other soft materials were easily shredded by the briars. The briartangle could be destroyed quickly with fire, but the fire would also harm anyone within.\nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components some mistletoe, a thorn from any plant, and a bud, leaf, or petal from a briar to cast."
