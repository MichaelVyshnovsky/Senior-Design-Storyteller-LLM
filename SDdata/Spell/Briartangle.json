        "mainbody": "'''''Briartangle''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[alteration]] [[spell]] used by priests devoted to [[Silvanus]], enabling them to convert shrubs into dense briars.",
        "Effects": "This spell transformed normal shrubbery or undergrowth into extremely thick and thorny briars. The briars would scratch and harm any creature trying to force their way through, though the damage was lessened for anyone wearing [[armor]] or having tougher skin. [[Wizard]]s caught within a ''briartangle'' could not cast any spells that involved a [[somatic component]]. Cloth and other soft materials were easily shredded by the briars. The ''briartangle'' could be destroyed quickly with fire, but the fire would also harm anyone within.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and somatic components, this spell required as [[material component]]s some [[mistletoe]], a thorn from any plant, and a bud, leaf, or petal from a briar to cast."
