'''''Greater distraction''''' was a common [[spell]] used by [[ninja]]s. The spell was very rare outside [[Kara-Tur]].

==Effects==
Ninja used this spell to distract a target. On casting, the ninja chose which sensation the target would be distracted by. The distractions were a physical sensation, such as itching. The sensation persisted until the target took the effort to relieve themselves of the distraction or until the spell expired. 

==Components==
The spell required only a [[somatic component|somatic]] component, namely [[kuji-kiri]] hand gestures.
