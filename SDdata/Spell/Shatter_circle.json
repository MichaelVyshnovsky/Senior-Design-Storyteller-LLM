        "mainbody": "'''''Shatter circle''''' was a [[Divine magic|divine]] [[abjuration]] [[spell]] used only by specialty priests devoted to [[Thoth]] called [[Scrivener]]s.\n\nThis spell was originally developed as a response to the [[Red Wizards]] ''[[circle]]'' spells. As such it only functioned when a ''circle'' spell was active.",
        "Effects": "This spell targeted the Red Wizard who was the focus of their ''circle'', shattering the circle and causing the Red Wizard to loose any spells gained from the circle.\n\nThough not designed for it, ''shatter circle'' was also effective against ''spellmelds'' used by the [[Wychlaran]] of [[Rashemen]], preventing the transference of spells between witches.",
        "Components": "In addition to [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s, this spell required as [[material component]]s a crushed [[ruby]] worth at least 500 [[gp]] to cast."
