'''''Hornung's guess''''' was a [[wild magic]] [[spell]] that was developed by the famous [[wild mage]] [[Hornung|Hornung the Anarch]] in order to improve his estimates.

==Effects==
''Hornung's guess'' was an area-of-effect spell with a range of over {{SI|300|yards|long=yes}}. It instantaneously provided its caster with highly accurate estimation of the numbers of individual people or a general class of objects within a group. All objects had to be within the spell's range and all people had to be visible to the caster.

The estimates provided by this spell were accurate to the largest factor of ten rounded up. For example, if used upon a group of horsemen that numbered thirty-seven in all then the spell would likely estimate their numbers to be forty individuals.

==Components==
This spell required only a [[verbal component]].

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Diviner's Guild]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] actively sold [[scroll]]s containing ''Hornung's guess'' for around 1,400 [[gp]].{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Living City: The Ravens Bluff Diviner's Guild|16}}

==Notable Users==
