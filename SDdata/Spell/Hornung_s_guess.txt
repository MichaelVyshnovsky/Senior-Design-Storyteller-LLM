Hornungs guess was a wild magic spell that was developed by the famous wild mage Hornung the Anarch in order to improve his estimates.
Hornungs guess was an area-of-effect spell with a range of over . It instantaneously provided its caster with highly accurate estimation of the numbers of individual people or a general class of objects within a group. All objects had to be within the spells range and all people had to be visible to the caster.
The estimates provided by this spell were accurate to the largest factor of ten rounded up. For example, if used upon a group of horsemen that numbered thirty-seven in all then the spell would likely estimate their numbers to be forty individuals.
This spell required only a verbal component.
In the 14 century DR, the Diviners Guild of Ravens Bluff actively sold scrolls containing Hornungs guess for around 1,400 gp.
* This spell was known to be particularly popular with moneylenders and military generals, as it could be used to quickly estimate the size of army units or treasure hordes.
