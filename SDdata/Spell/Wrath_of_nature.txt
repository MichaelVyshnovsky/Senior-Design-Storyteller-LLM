'''''Wrath of nature''''' was an [[evocation]] [[spell]] used by [[ranger]]s and [[druid]]s that called the spirits of nature to fight on the caster's behalf.

==Effects==
The spell called forth spirits of nature to animate [[tree]]s, grass, roots, vines, and rocks within the volume of a cube {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}} on a side. The grass hindered the caster's enemies' movement, making it extremely taxing and difficult. The trees started whipping around, slashing any of the caster's enemies that came too close with their branches. Roots and vines rose from the ground and restrained hostile creatures of the caster's choice one at a time. At the caster's command, rocks flew at designated targets, battering and knocking them down. This activity lasted for up to 1 minute, as long as the caster kept concentrating.

==Components==
The spell required only [[verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s.
