        "mainbody": "'''''Enchant an item''''' was a powerful spell, and a common alternative in the practice of [[item enchantment]] by wizards;{{cite book/Book of Artifacts|131-133}}",
        "Effects": "Before beginning, the caster required a place of undisturbed quiet, where they remained no less than {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} away from any other magical item not specifically related to the process, including most defensive items, for the duration of the casting. The spell required an item to be enchanted, which had to remain in contact with the mage casting the spell throughout the casting. As on average it took an uninterrupted week to cast the spell, with some castings stretching up to a tenday, and interrupting the caster would force them to start over again, this spell was unlikely to be undertaken lightly.\n\nOnce the initial stage was complete, the caster could employ other spells to add new properties to the item to be enchanted. Both the initial casting and those other spells had to be cast or read from a scroll, as magical items could not be used to add properties to new magical items.{{cite book/Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition|118}}{{cite book/Dungeon Master Option: High-Level Campaigns|95}} The caster's ability to manage and endure the magic without being overwhelmed would be tested throughout the process, with their performance changing what the process would yield. Less than perfect results were a possibility hard to discount even for the most experienced of enchanters; all but the most catastrophic failures still created ''something'', often a [[cursed]] object, but not always.{{cite book/The Magister|63-64}}\n\nCharged items required no further processes, but permanent items required a ''[[permanency]]'' spell for finishing. ''[[Wish]]'' could be used as a substitute for ''permanency'', in some cases.\n\nWhen used on an already enchanted, charged item, the ''enchant an item'' spell instead allowed for it to be recharged. However, it was a long process, calling for two or three hours between new charges.",
        "Components": "The spell had [[verbal]] and [[somatic]] components. The item to be enchanted was considered a material component.{{cite book/Volo's Guide to All Things Magical|64}}\n\nThe nature of the object's preparation in order for it to be enchanted was a subject of much research, which could call for bizarre processes and esoteric, even intangible, components. In all cases, it had to be of superlative make, in perfectly sound condition, and made of the finest materials. Superior materials could yield better odds, but the cost soon turned exorbitant. While generalization was extremely difficult, some sources clarified that the materials to be employed in the creation of the item also were to be fresh and as of yet untouched by any other magic, as well as of a nature relating to their intended function.",
        "History": "The spell was already known by the time of [[Netheril]], its invention not attributed to any of its arcanists. It was part of all three known schools then. [[Wu jen]] employed the spell as well.\n\nThe spell was known to be listed in ''[[the Scalamagdrion]]''{{cite book/Pages from the Mages|92}}{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Set/DM's Sourcebook of the Realms|190-191}} and the ''[[Tome of Shaping Secrets]]''.{{cite book/The Shattered Statue|14}} ''[[The Scrolls of Ha Rahni]]'', written by a wu jen from [[Kara-Tur]], bore the spell as well.{{cite book/Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms/Volume I|63}} The insane lichnee [[Druth Daern]] of [[Myth Drannor]] also had this spell in his working spellbook.\n\nBy {{yearlink|1358}} it had grown rare;{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Adventures|153}} it was all but forgotten by the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, having been replaced by other, universally more accessible and far more reliable techniques.{{cite book/Player's Handbook v.3.5|92-93}}",
        "Trivia": "The spell was needed for the focus of the versions of ''[[trap the soul]]'' available by {{yearlink|1357}}.{{cite book/Players Handbook 1st edition|92}} The ''[[demiplane seed]]'' spell best known before {{yearlink|1372}} required a focus prepared using ''enchant an item'', ''[[rope trick]]'', and ''[[distance distortion]]''.{{cite book/A Guide to the Ethereal Plane|39}} The spell was also required to prepare the material component of the ''[[triad gem]]'' spell.{{cite book/Cult of the Dragon|80}}\n\n[[Lightning golem]]s were made using this spell; the hearts of [[stone guardian]]s were also similarly made. The phylacteries of [[dracolich]]es{{cite book/Cult of the Dragon|103}} and of regular [[lich]]es called for ''enchant an item'' in their construction too.{{cite book/Wizard's Spell Compendium Volume Four|1087-1088}}{{cite book/Lords of Darkness|73-74}} Though [[doom guard]]s were not made with this spell, the ''[[anvil of darkness]]'' used to create them was.\n\n[[gray slaad|Grey]] and [[death slaad]]i were known to possess this spell;{{cite book/Monstrous Compendium Planescape Appendix|90-91}} [[red slaad]]i could be enslaved for up to six tasks with a charm made of a pellet removed by ''[[wish]]'', ''[[spiritwrack]]'', and ''[[limited wish]]'', using ''enchant an item''.{{cite book/Fiend Folio 1st edition|81-82}}\n\nAlbeit the spell could not ordinarily be cast out of a magical item,{{cite book/The Magister|36}}\n\nThe spell took ten times as long in the [[Ethereal plane]],{{cite book/Manual of the Planes 1st edition|18}} and half as long in the [[Inner Planes]].{{cite book/Manual of the Planes 1st edition|28}} It did not work at all in the [[Astral plane]].{{cite dragon/67/The Astral Plane|35}}"
