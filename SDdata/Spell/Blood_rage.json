        "mainbody": "Blood mantle was a divine enchantment spell used only by specialty priests devoted to Garagos called Bloodreavers.\nThis spell filled the target with the rage and bloodlust of a berserker, causing them to wildly attack nearby opponents including their own companions. A target affected by blood mantle would attack the closest foe, moving on to the next closest when they were slain. The spell would last until the target went three minutes without being within  of an opponent to attack. \nA target affected by this spell was easily able to resist physical pain and magical attacks that would have felled them otherwise. The chaos of the blood rage prevented the target from using any ranged attack, nor did they even bother to try to avoid incoming ranged attacks. Any healing spells cast upon the target did not take effect until the blood rage ended. If the target survived the wounds accumulated during their rage, they were left enfeebled when the spell ended. Blood mantle could be ended early via a dispel magic spell or similar magic. \nThis spell had no effect on true berserkers, dwarven battleragers, or similar beings. \nIn addition to verbal and somatic components, this spell required as material components the priests holy symbol either a bloodstone or pieces of a bloodstone to cast."
