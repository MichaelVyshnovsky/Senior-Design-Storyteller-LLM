Mage tunnel was an alteration spell that allowed the caster to transverse vast distances within an instant.
Upon the casting of mage tunnel, a magical passageway was created between the caster and a target location of their choosing. The exit of the passage had to be an area outdoors, within 1000 mi (1609 km) that was known to the caster prior to casting the spell.
There was a chance that anyone standing near the passageways opening would be taken by surprise, sucked inside and discharged to the location where the spell was originally cast. The caster was completely immune to this effect and count enter freely at their will.
Mage tunnel was developed by Szass Tam the infamous necromancer of the Red Wizards. He soon discovered that the spell was invaluable for times when he had to resort to kidnapping, or when it was required to dismiss those he no longer wished to stand in his presence.
The casting of this spell required verbal, somatic and material components, the last of which was a 1" (2.5 cm) ring of copper, engraved with silver runes.
