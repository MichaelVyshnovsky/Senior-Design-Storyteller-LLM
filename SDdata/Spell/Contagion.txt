Contagion was a necromancy spell that inflicted a horrendous disease on a target.
Older versions of the contagion spell infected a touched target with a vicious infestation, like boils, lesions, seeping abscesses, blotches, or worse. This would reduce a targets strength, agility, and looks, unless they spent weeks recuperating or a remove disease spell was cast on them. If the victim did not get any aid, then the diseases would get even worse.
Newer versions caused specific diseases to infect the target, such as blinding sickness, cackle fever, filth fever, flesh rot, mindfire, red ache, seizure, or slimy doom.
Only verbal and somatic components were needed for the casting.
The spell was attributed to Netherese arcanist Lucke in  and was originally called Luckes contagion.
A similar spell, known as plague carrier, inflicted the same diseases as contagion but as normal illnesses with natural incubation times, allowing the target to unknowingly begin to spread their affliction.
