            "Racial Practitioners": "Besides orcs,{{Cite dragon/141/Orcs Throw Spells, Too!|27}} [[fire troll]]s,{{Cite dragon/199/The Dragon's Bestiary: Those terrible trolls|199}} the various standard [[goblinoid]] races, [[gnoll]]s and [[flind]]s, [[orog]]s, and [[xvart]]s.\n\nWitch doctors were extremely rare among [[giant]]s, [[fog giant]]s, and [[mountain giant]]s.This core source also mentions [[fomorian]]s and [[verbeeg]] as being capable of being witchdoctors. However, the Realms source ''[[Giantcraft]]'' says otherwise. And beyond humanoids, humans and neanderthals could be found practicing this tradition.",
            "Practition by Region": "[[Orc]] communities that practiced this tradition could be found in [[the North]], the [[Thousand Fists]] tribe in the [[Nether Mountains]],{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 10}} the [[Goblin Marches]], and the [[Storm Horns]]. Also in the North, the tribal humans known as [[Ice Hunter]]s practiced this tradition, with the most ancient of them having limited use of powerful ice, snow, and cold magics. In [[southwest Faerûn]], witch doctors could be found among tribes on the [[Chultan Peninsula]], where they often purchased mined materials from the local [[Chultan dwarves]].<ref>\n\nBeyond [[Faerûn]], witch doctors could be found in parts of the continent of [[Kara-Tur]]. In [[T'u Lung]], witch doctors were [[T'u Lung language|locally referred to]] as '''kio ton mu''' and were typically members of cults,<ref> such as the [[Black Leopard Cult]]. On the [[Malatran Plateau]], witch doctors could be found in the tribes of the various races that inhabited it,{{Cite polyhedron/102/Heroes of Malatra|13}}{{Cite polyhedron/121/Living Jungle Character Generation|18}} but were rarer and more powerful compared to the Plateau's shamans.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/108/Living Jungle Q&A|14}} The Plateau's [[shu]] tribes for example, those with five or more families typically had a witch doctor.{{Cite polyhedron/102/Malatra Monstrous Compendium Sheets|24}} And in the [[Southern Ocean]], witch doctors could be found among the [[Island Kingdoms]].\n\nIn the land of [[Zakhara]], the [[maskhi]] had male witch doctors that typically specialized in the arcane provinces of [[sand (province)|sand]] and [[wind (province)|wind]]. And beyond surface worlds, they could be found on goblinoid [[spelljammer]]s.",
            "Practition by Faith": "In terms of religions, humanoid witch doctors could be found in service of evil-aligned [[demihuman]] or human deities,{{Cite dragon/141/Orcs Throw Spells, Too!|24}} such as [[Auril]]<ref> or [[Bhaal]] in the case of the orcs of the [[Trollmoors]]. Among the humanoid deities, witch doctors were in service of the [[Goblinoid pantheon]],\n\nMuch like [[warlock]]s, witch doctors could also be servitors of powerful non-deity entities. In terms of [[fiend]]s, witch doctors could be found in service of [[archdevil]]s, [[demon lord]]s,{{Cite dragon/141/Orcs Throw Spells, Too!|33}} and [[Yugoloth#Greater_Yugoloths|greater daemons]],"

        "Abilities": "Witch doctors were often proficient in the fields of [[astrology]], [[herbalism]], agriculture, dancing, singing, [[wine]]making,{{Cite dragon/141/Hey, Wanna Be a Kobold|42-43}}\n\nWitch doctors drew their clerical spells from up to three [[sphere]]s, while their arcane spells were limited to a single [[school of magic]]. The arcane spells of a witch doctor were kept within a [[spellbook]], though those on the Malatran Plateau did not. They liberally utilized their spells in order to maintain their tribe's confidence in their power.\n\nThe spells wielded by humanoid witch doctors of evil deities were typically offensive and defensive, rather than curative. Some favorite spells of theirs included ''[[cause light wounds]]'', ''[[chant]]'', and ''[[dispel magic]]''. The few curative spells they had were kept for use after battles or for use by a tribe's chieftain. Those who were servitors of [[good]] or [[neutral]] deities had more balanced spell selections and were more likely to use their powers to directly benefit their tribe as a whole. Evil humanoid shamans could typically control [[skeleton]]s and [[zombie]]s, but almost never had access to [[necromancy]] spells, while good and neutral ones could [[turn undead|turn them]].{{Cite dragon/141/Orcs Throw Spells, Too!|25}}\n\nLike any spellcaster, they could man a [[spelljamming helm]].",
        "Possessions": "Much like a wizard, witch doctors never wore armor. The spellbooks carried by humanoid witch doctors were often crude and bulky tablets of poor-quality [[paper]] or wood. This was due to the difficulty of obtaining expensive [[parchment]], their inability to afford improving them, or lack of skill necessary to improve them.\n\nWitch doctors often had [[magical item]]s, including [[cursed item|cursed ones]] like a ''[[necklace of strangulation]]'', and [[scroll]]s. They could even wield items that were usually restricted to wizards. Much like spells, a witch doctor liberally utilized their magical items in order to maintain their tribe's confidence in their power. Because of this, they often seized and hoarded all such suspected magical items brought into their tribe.",
        "History": "Before the rise of [[Netheril]], witch doctors were among the few human spellcasters on [[Toril]].<ref>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|400}}, witch doctors of [[Gruumsh]] were among the orc forces in the [[Dark Alliance]] that assembled to assault [[Northkeep]].<ref> Orc witch doctors were a part of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] that besieged the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1312}}.",
