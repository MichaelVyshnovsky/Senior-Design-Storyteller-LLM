'''''Whistle''''' was a haunting [[cantrip]] that initiate [[wizard]]s could learn.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|6}} It caused the sound of air blowing through a constricted opening to be heard from a location designated by the caster.

==Effects==
This cantrip had a range of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} and produced a sound that could heard faintly by creatures with typical hearing capability that were within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of the target point. The caster had the option of increasing the volume and extending the area of effect to a radius of {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}}. The timbre and nature of the whistle was also adjustable, from a sharp, musical, attention-getting chirp to a far-away, echoing, eerie, mournful sigh.

==Components==
This cantrip required [[verbal]] and [[somatic component]]s to cast. The caster gazed at the spot from which the sound was to emanate, placed two fingers near their mouth, and gave a quiet whistle in the same fashion as the desired result.
