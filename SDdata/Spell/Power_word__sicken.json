        "mainbody": "Power word, sicken, was an arcane spell from the enchantment school of magic.\nThe spell was able to make one creature sickened.\nThe spell only worked on creatures under a certain high degree of health, whether they could hear it not. Creatures more robust were unharmed. The target had to be close to the spellcaster.\nThe spell required only a verbal component, which was the uttering of the power word itself.\nThe spell could be learned and cast by both sorcerers and wizards."
