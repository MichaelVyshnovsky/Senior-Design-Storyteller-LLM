'''''Age to destruction''''' was a common spell used by [[ninja]]s to commit acts of sabotage. 

==Effects==
The spell would rapidly age any material by one hundred years. The maximum volume of material was 3 cubic feet (84.9 liters). The material's appearance was largely unaffected by the spell; the material would only appear more weathered than before the spell was cast. Certain materials were affected more than others. Metal and wood were particularly susceptible but the spell had little effect on minerals and stone. 

The spell did not affect creatures but could alter the effects of certain [[potion]]s. For example, the spell did not reverse the effects of a ''[[longevity]]'' potion but if cast on the potion itself, it would render the potion useless.

==Components==
The spell required only [[somatic component]]s.
