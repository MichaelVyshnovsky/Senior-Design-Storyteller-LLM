        "mainbody": "Animate rope, originally known as Vilates restriction and later bind,\nIn the time of Netheril, Vilates restriction could be cast by arcanists of the Variation specialization.\nBind could be learned and cast by arcane magic-users,\nAnimate rope could be learned and cast by wizards with access to the transmutation school, and by sorcerers and bards, as well as wu jen. In Zakhara, elemental mages and sorcerers could learn it as part of the universal province.\nAnimate rope could be also be used by clerics with access to the Craft domain—that is, those who worshiped Gond of the Faerûnian pantheon Geb or Thoth of the Mulhorandi pantheon Callarduran Smoothhands, Flandal Steelskin, or Garl Glittergold of the gnome pantheon or Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Laduguer, or Moradin of the dwarven pantheon.\nThis spell was effective on unattended non-living rope and rope-like objects such as twine, string, yarn, cable, or cord.\nBind or animate rope could be cast at a rope up to  or later  away, but if the intention was to interact with a creature or an object, then the rope had to be in close proximity () with its intended target&mdashthe rope could not slither or fly any greater distance. For unwilling targets, this often required someone hurling the rope at them or maneuvering them close to a length of rope.\nThe commands available with this spell were Coil, Coil & Knot, Loop, Loop & Knot, and Tie & Knot. Coil caused the rope to form a neatly organized stack Coil & Knot bound the stack for convenient carrying. Loop wrapped a length of rope around an object, like a tree or the feet of an adversary Loop & Knot tied the rope to the tree or formed a lasso. Tie & Knot wrapped the object securely, like a present or a prisoner. The caster could also order the reverse of any of these commands (Uncoil, etc.).\nThe rope did no direct damage to a creature, so it could not be used to choke or strangle, but it could be used to trip or entangle, with the expected results. The intended victim got one chance to resist the magic of this spell or suffered the consequences. Bind did not enhance the rope in any way it remained a non-magical object that could be cut or manipulated like any other rope. The knots themselves were also not magical.\nA caster using an animated rope could use it to tie knots and perform other uses of rope a little more easily.\nBoth verbal and somatic components were required to cast this spell. The material component was the target rope, which was not consumed in the casting.\nThis spell was invented by a Netherese variator named Vilate in 1664 NY (−2195 DR) and was known as Vilates restriction.\nEventually, it became known as simply bind\nThe spell was known as animate rope after 1372 DR.\nthumb|right|Kilili casting bind on Onyx.Bind was a favorite of the drow magic-user Kilili in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR. She used it to trap and toy with the elven women that Imgig Zu and his chasme minions kidnapped for her to test. She later used it to tie up and gag Onyx the Invincible, largely to stop him complaining. Uniquely, her version required no rope at all, and instead conjured blue or green strands out of the air, and they dissipated at the end of the spells duration.\nDuring the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR in Waterdeep, the false avatar of Selûne stole a coil of rope from a member of the Dark Army of the Night whod tried to kidnap her and used bind to tie the three up.\nThe Scrolls of Ha Rahni, the spellbook of Ha Rahni of Shou Lung, included a copy of bind.\nThe Ky Trencha Ukang, a magical staff of eldritch power created in Koryo, could be used to cast bind at will."
