Thunderwave was a spell of low complexity that was known by some wizards.
An evocation spell, thunderwave created a blast of sonic energy that could cause bodily harm to any enemies within an area of  of the spell, in addition to pushing them backwards, away from the blast zone. The distance a creature caught in the blast was pushed depended upon the casters degree of self-control and perception. The spell dissipated almost instantaneously.
