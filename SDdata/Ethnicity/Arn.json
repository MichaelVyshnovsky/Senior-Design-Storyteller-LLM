        "mainbody": "The '''Arn''' was a collective term adopted by the [[Strongheart halfling|strongheart]] [[halfling]]s who lived on the [[Arnrock]] island in the [[Lake of Steam]].",
        "Culture": "Each member of the Arn belonged to the [[Brolluck]], [[Minstrelwish]], or [[Rauligar]] clans, but all of them were related to each other. They were somewhat insular, and non-halflings were generally not welcome among their social gatherings.\n\nThey populated the whole caldera of the Arnrock&mdash;which they called \"Old Smokey\"&mdash; and took advantage of the rich soil to grow crops and the easy access to the Lake for fishing. The Rauligar family also used the natural geothermal heat of the volcano's rifts to cast [[copper]]. The closest they had to a town was a ramshackle village called [[Sleeping Hollow]].",
        "History": "Thanks to an ancient treaty that prevented the cities of the Lake of Steam from laying claim to the island, the Arn were the sole inhabitants of the Arnrock.\n\nThe Arn had weathered eruptions of Old Smokey, and as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], they were well aware that the volcano was overdue for an eruption. Any survivors migrated elsewhere, including eastern [[Amn]] and the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]."
