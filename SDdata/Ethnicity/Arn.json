        "mainbody": "he Arn was a collective term adopted by the strongheart halflings who lived on the Arnrock island in the Lake of Steam.\nEach member of the Arn belonged to the Brolluck, Minstrelwish, or Rauligar clans, but all of them were related to each other. They were somewhat insular, and non-halflings were generally not welcome among their social gatherings.\nThey populated the whole caldera of the Arnrock&mdashwhich they called \"Old Smokey\"&mdash and took advantage of the rich soil to grow crops and the easy access to the Lake for fishing. The Rauligar family also used the natural geothermal heat of the volcanos rifts to cast copper. The closest they had to a town was a ramshackle village called Sleeping Hollow.\nThanks to an ancient treaty that prevented the cities of the Lake of Steam from laying claim to the island, the Arn were the sole inhabitants of the Arnrock.\nThe Arn had weathered eruptions of Old Smokey, and as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, they were well aware that the volcano was overdue for an eruption. Any survivors migrated elsewhere, including eastern Amn and the Sea of Fallen Stars."
