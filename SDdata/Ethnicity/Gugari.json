        "mainbody": "The '''Gugari''' were a secluded ethnic group of [[spirit folk]] that lived in the [[Hordelands]] between the continents of [[Faer√ªn]] and [[Kara-Tur]]. They resided solely within the [[Hollow Crown Mountains]] within two cities in the valley nestled within its peaks, and were [[mountain spirit folk|descended]] from the spirits of those mountains. \n\nThese people held on dearly to the traditions of the long-lost [[Guge]] kingdom from which they descended but practiced many troubling customs that prevented them from progressing with the rest of the world. Despite their efforts, they appeared unlikely to restore the glory of the past, which they so desperately sought.",
        "Description": "The Gugari a hardy people, somewhat smaller in stature than full-blooded [[human]]s. Men tended to be stout and burly, while women were more slender and fair-skinned. They were all marked by distinctive, coarse blonde hair.",
        "Government": {
            "Law & Order": "Due to the negligence of law enforcement by the Gugari ruling class, the cities of the Hollow Crown Mountains were overrun with crime. Theft and more debased crimes were tolerated, and only murder was met with public outcry. Infamous or otherwise distinguished criminals were publicly executed in grand public displays during festival events."

        "Society": {
            "Dress & Fashion": "In the summer months, Men wore scarce clothing and women often dressed in thin, [[silk]] garments. During the winter, dense coats of [[yak]] wool were common, often dyed in earth tones. Only Gugari royalty were ever allowed to adorn themselves in clothes dyed blue or red.",
            "Religion": "Following the split of the Gugari people, the kingdom's priests sided with the councilors of the east and the realm's wizards joined the princes of the west. The priests of the east primarily venerated [[Niynjushigampo]], the God of Death, while the mages focused their studies on the arcane school of [[necromancy]].\n\nThe concept of death and the ceremonies involved were placed in high importance by both factions of the Gugari people. They practiced human sacrifice and regularly tortured prisoners to death for the pleasure of the ruling class."
        },
        "History": "The Gugari people descended from those of the ancient kingdom of [[Guge]]. The last known monarch to rule over a united Gugari people was the mad king, [[Kalon Doring]].\n\nFollowing the [[Time of Troubles]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the eastern priests of Gugari experienced a schism within their ranks. Some of their order were drawn to the power of the god [[Sirhivatizangpo]], who had ascended in the latter months that year, while others maintained that Niynjushigampo still held dominion over death."
