'''Calishite''' was the name given to the majority of [[human]]s who came from [[Calimshan]].{{cite book/Races of Faerûn|81}} The variant "'''Calimshite'''" was also used. "[[Calimite]]", however, was a deeply insulting name for these people.

==Regions==
Though Calishites had migrated outside the realm of Calimshan. Calishites made up the bulk of the population in the following areas:

* The [[Border Kingdoms]]
* The cities of the [[Lake of Steam (region)|Lake of Steam]]
* The [[Nelanther Isles]]
* [[Calimshan]]

Calishites were also a major ethnic group in the nations of [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]] and could be found in smaller numbers in [[Lapaliiya]] and the [[Shaar]].

==Appearance==
Calishites usually had dusky brown skin, brown hair and brown eyes. They were also on average a little shorter and of slighter build than most humans of other ethnicities.

==History==
Calishites were descendants of the slaves of the [[genie]]s who ruled great empires south of the [[Marching Mountains]]. These ancestors were not native to the continent of [[Faerûn]].{{cite book/Calimport|13}} After the [[djinni]] [[Calim]]'s power dwindled, the Calishites were able to free themselves of the genies' yoke and founded the nation of [[Coramshan]] in {{Yearlink|-6060}}.{{cite book/Calimport|14}} Since this time the Calishite race has expanded and migrated to the various regions listed above.

==Culture==
The pervading Calishite view was that they were the rightful rulers of all the land south and west of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. They had a tendency to look on the northern cultures as being short-lived barbarian cultures barely worthy of notice. This, however, did not prevent them from trading with these nations.
