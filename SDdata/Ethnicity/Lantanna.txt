The Lantanna were the native human race of the islands of the nation of Lantan.
The Lantanna were one of the more recognizable human ethnic groups with their copper-red hair, large, green eyes, and pale, parchment-hued skin tones. They were rarely seen outside of their three native islands, except as merchants on trading vessels.
The Lantanna spoke their own language. Strangely, they used the Draconic alphabet to write. Scholars speculated that they borrowed this script from Halruaan or Nimbrali traders of the past.
Most Lantanna venerated Gond and believed that he entered the Faer√ªnian pantheon from their people.
