The '''Dalat''' were a tribe of nomadic [[human]]s living in the [[Hordelands]].{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|48}} They were among the tribes mistakenly called "[[Tuigan]]" by outsiders following the [[Horde Wars]].

==Territory==
The Dalat lived in the southern region of the Endless Waste. Their lands bordered those of the [[Tuigan]] and [[Naican]] tribes.

==Society==
They spoke the [[Dalat language]], a language influenced by the [[Muhjuri]] language.

The Dalat were enemies with the Naican and the [[Fankiang]], while maintaining friendly relations with the [[Kashghun]]. They sometimes raided with the [[Oigur]] against the Naicans.

==History==
For centuries, the Dalat have raided Naican territory, and the conflicts only grew worse over the years, resulting in blood feuds and nearly open warfare.

Around the time of the late 14{{th}} century, a young Dalat ''noyan'' (noble) attended a ''couralitai'', a grand council of the ''khans'' (princes of the villages), called by [[Yamun Khahan]]. During this council, the ''noyan'' desired one of the other noblemans' daughters for himself, from one of the Fankiang tribes. Even though she was engaged to another, this Dalat ''noyan'' kidnapped her, beginning a blood feud between the two groups.
