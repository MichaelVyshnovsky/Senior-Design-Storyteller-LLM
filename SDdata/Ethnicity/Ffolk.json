        "mainbody": "The Ffolk were a race of humans that inhabited the Moonshae Isles alongside the Northlanders. The Ffolk inhabited the southern parts of the Moonshaes, including Flamsterd, Moray, Snowdown, and Sunset, and the southern parts of Alaron and Gwynneth. Their society was mainly agricultural and was ruled by a High King or Queen who resided in Caer Callidyrr, the capital of the Ffolk.\nModern Ffolk were mostly of Tethyrian origin, following a large Tethyrian immigration in 467 DR. This caused the Ffolk to lose much of their original racial heritage, although their culture was quite distinct from their mainland cousins and they held to a strong druidic tradition.\nThe Ffolk spent most of their time on peaceful pastimes such as farming, fishing, hunting, and trading. They were also accomplished shipbuilders, specializing in a type of ship that was designed to withstand some of the roughest seas.\nThe Ffolk worshiped the Earthmother, an aspect of Chauntea.\nThe Ffolk had a deep reverence for nature and the land around them, always respecting the divine power in a misty forest, a rushing river or even a hidden pool.\nModern Ffolk spoke Illuskan, and they employed the Thorass script. \nThe druids of the Moonshaes spoke Waelan, the original language of the Ffolk.\nThe first Ffolk to appear on the Moonshae Isles were members of the lost tribes of Talfir who fled Ebenfar to escape the Shadowking Verraketh. Their first settlement was in 140 DR, on a island they named Gwynneth.\nAfter defeating the creature known as Kazgoroth, Cymrych Hugh was crowned king of the Moonshae Isles in 201 DR.\nThe Ffolk controlled the isles up until an invasion by Illuskans forced them to concede the northern section of the isles in 256 DR.\nIn 621 DR, Ffolk colonized the Utter East and enslaved the native Mar of the area, carving it up into the Five Kingdoms.\nTheir settlements formed a small kingdom on the Moonshaes, ruled by the High Queen Alicia Kendrick in the late 1300s DR.\nThe Ffolk were considered to have darker skin and hair than the Northlanders.\nThe Ffolk had a long-term conflict with the other group of people who inhabited the Moonshaes, the Northlanders."
