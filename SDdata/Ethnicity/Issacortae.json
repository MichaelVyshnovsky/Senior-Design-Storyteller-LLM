        "mainbody": "The Issacortae people inhabited the western part of the wild lands of Ama Basin in Kara-Tur.\nThe Issacortae were medium build and muscular with black curly hair. Semi-nomadic tribes of Issacortae followed herds of elk and reindeer, which they raised. Agriculture was practiced to a small degree, and fishing and hunting occasionally.\nThe weapons used by the tribes were usually axes, bows, spears, and clubs. \nRuled by their king, the Issacortae were the most civilized tribe in the northern lands. The Issacortae were not one tribe, but a union of many tribes who obeyed the king, called the Issacort Confederation. Each tribe was ruled by a chieftain, who served as both chieftain and military commander. The eight tribes formed a union that followed the laws of their High King and High Queen.\nThey spoke the Issacortae language.\nUsually religion had a very large impact on the tribes. They commonly practiced animism and shamanism. Shamans could be men or women. Shamans were often treated with great respect and awe by the population."
