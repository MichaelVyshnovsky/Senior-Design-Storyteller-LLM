        "Description": "The Tashalans were generally considered a beautiful people by other human cultures. They had black hair and olive-colored skin.",
        "Language": "Tashalan people spoke the [[Tashalan language]], which made use of the [[Dethek]] script.",
        "Religion": "Tashalans especially revered [[Savras]] and [[Talona]] among the other gods of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]], but they were not limited in worship to those two gods. Some also maintained their historical worship of the [[yuan-ti]] deities.",
        "History": "This people group originated on the Chultan Peninsula many thousands of years before the start of the [[Dale Reckoning]]. They were eventually enslaved by the [[sarrukh]], the reptilian [[Creator race]].\n\nWhen the sarrukh empire fell, many Tashalans continued to serve the yuan-ti. Others settled in lands all along the peninsula. Over time, those in the western part of the peninsula were driven out by the [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] tribes. Those in the south and east were merged into the [[Halruaa]]n and [[Dambrath]]an cultures.\n\nThe lands of the Tashalar were further settled by [[Lapalian]]s and [[Calishite]]s in {{Yearlink|-553}}, introducing new people groups to the region. After the [[Empire Plague]] in {{Yearlink|-375}}, the population of the region was greatly reduced, and the humans remaining were easily enslaved once again by the [[Serpentes Empire]] of the yuan-ti by {{Yearlink|-189}}. The yuan-ti god [[Sseth]] strangely disappeared in [[10 DR]], which led to downfall of the yuan-ti. The human slaves were able to rebel and gain their freedom by [[34 DR]]. The former slaves, the original natives of the land&mdash;now merged with Calishites, Chultans, Lapalians, and [[Shaaran]]s&mdash;became the modern Tashalan people.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], most Tashalans remained in the middle of the Chultan Peninsula and on the island of [[Tharsult]].",
