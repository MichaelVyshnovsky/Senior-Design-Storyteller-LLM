The '''Ulutiuns''' were a grouping of related races of [[human]]s who inhabited the far polar regions of [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Ulutiuns had dark, light brown,

Ulutiun males did not grow facial hair, and men and women had more fat under their skin than other humans and extra blood vessels in their extremities. These adaptive variations granted them a special resistance to living in the frigid weather of the polar regions.

They wore thick clothing made from furs and hides.

Ulutiuns were an adaptable people and lived close to nature. They tended to be warm and friendly once one got to know them.

Ulutiuns were divided into four sub-groupings. The [[Ice Hunters]] lived in the west, in the regions of the the [[Cold Run]], the [[Ice Peak]], and the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. The [[Angulutiun]]s, [[Iulutiun]]s, and [[Nakulutiun]]s resided in the [[Great Glacier]].

==Language==
The Ice Hunters spoke [[Uluik]], and the Ulutiuns of the Great Glacier spoke [[Ulutiun language|Ulutiun]].<ref name=D:SiT-p26>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} Both were closely related languages.<ref name=D:SiT-p28>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|28}}

==Religion==
The Ice Hunters venerated various nature spirits and had a shamanistic form of religion. Iulutiuns and Angulutiuns did not have a religion, but the Nakulutiuns worshiped [[Ulutiu]].

==Combat==
Since metal was rare on glaciers, Ulutiun warriors had inferior weapons and armor compared to the peoples of the [[Cold Lands]] to the south, yet they were known for being ferocious in battle with a unparalleled ability to survive their arctic climates. They favored [[spear]]s. If forced to fight, they battled to the death.

==History==
Ulutiuns were originally from the lands of [[Kara-Tur]] and migrated west to Faerûn over the ice over a thousand years before the [[Dalereckoning]].
