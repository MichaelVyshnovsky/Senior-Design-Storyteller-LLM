        "mainbody": "The '''Llewyrr''', also known as the '''Llewyr''', were a race of [[elves]] that once held sway over the isle of [[Gwynneth]] and perhaps others of the [[Moonshae Isles]]. As [[human]]s began to colonize the islands, the Llewyrr decided to retreat to [[Synnoria]] and isolate themselves.",
        "Description": "The Llewyrr had fair skin, golden hair, and green or brown eyes with flecks of gold.{{Cite dragon/405/Heroes of the Moonshaes|6-7}} They were very similar to those called the [[high elves]] and were the descendants of the survivors of a shipwrecked elven vessel that was on a pilgrimage to [[Evermeet]].",
        "Society": "Llewyrr elves lived mostly in small, remote sanctuaries hidden from the outside world.{{Cite dragon/405/Heroes of the Moonshaes|2}} Births were rare and cause for great celebration, but they were not enough to replace those lost to natural causes, accidents, and battle. Male children were especially rare and many of the traditionally male duties were taken over by females, including the defense of the realm. The warriors of the Llewyrr were called the [[Sisters of Synnoria]] and rode white [[horse#Charger|chargers]] into battle with silver [[lance]]s and enchanted [[longsword]]s. By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], an order of [[crusader]]s known as the [[Knights of Synnoria]] also served as defenders of Llewyrr settlements. All such Llewyrr warriors took the time to learn how to wield traditional elven weapons.\n\nThe Llewyrr were vegetarians, shunning all meat, and the animals of [[Myrloch Vale]] were either trusting friends or treated as pets. [[Trout]] were regarded as sacred creatures that some believed represented the spirits of their ancestors. The Llewyrr had strong, [[primal]] bonds with the natural world, and venerated \"fey gods\" rather than the [[Seldarine]]. This mainly included the powerful [[primal spirit]]s that watched over the Moonshaes, such as the [[Earthmother]] and her children.\n\nGiven their long history of isolationism, those Llewyrr who wished to learn about another culture were more likely to study its history rather than meet with them, and many Llewyrr were voracious consumers of such histories. The Llewyrr also felt little kinship with other elves outside of their own culture, and distrusted elven \"politics\" in all forms. In particular, they retained a lingering grudge against all [[sun elves]] for ancient aggressions against their people. Although they were slow to form ties with outsiders, the Llewyrr were strongly invested in their familial and community connections. Their friendships were lifetime bonds, and they considered their promises to be binding oaths.\n\nAllies of the Llewyrr included those who venerated primal spirits, [[fey]], and the [[druid circle]]s of the Moonshaes, with whom they studied the natural world and learned to speak the [[Druidic language]]. The Llewyrr were also known to value mastery of [[arcane magic]].",
        "History": "At the time of the [[Crown Wars]], the Llewyrr elves were the [[moon elf]] inhabitants of the [[Llewyrrwood]] on the [[Sword Coast]]. They fled the [[Aryvandaar|Vyshaan]] occupation of their homeland in {{Yearlink|-9800}}, and after failing to reach Evermeet due to a fierce storm, arrived in the Moonshaes where they were greeted by the [[leShay]]. [[Synnoria]], the Llewyrr realm, was founded by these refugees in the safety of the mountains. They named the realm after [[Synnoria (person)|their queen]] who had led them over the sea.\n\nOver the next eleven thousand years, these elves developed into their own distinct subrace. While their physical appearance changed, they retained a passion for [[magic]] and for the building of grand cities. The Llewyrr expanded the capital city of [[Chrysalis]] and enhanced its beauty with works of magic into a dazzling settlement of glass, [[rock crystal|crystal]], and [[silver]]. But over the millennia, as isolation and declining birth rates took their toll, Chrysalis became quietly abandoned due to the dwindling population.\n\nLong before the humans arrived in the Moonshaes, [[dwarves]] began to immigrate and lived in peace with the Llewyrr mostly due to the fact that they did not compete for resources. The dwarves lived underground and in barren and rocky terrain in which the Llewyrr had no interest. When the Beast in the form of [[Kazgoroth]] rose to threaten the Balance by calling the [[firbolg]]s to kill and pillage, the Llewyrr and the dwarves, aided by the children of the goddess ([[Leviathan]], [[Kamerynn]], and [[The Pack]]) fought them for decades. Eventually the allies drove the firbolgs into small corners of the isles and balance was restored for a few centuries. When the short-lived, prolific, and aggressive humans started to arrive, the Llewyrr began their retreat into isolation.\n\nAs the Llewyrr felt little affinity for the rest of elvenkind, very few of them joined the [[Retreat]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1345}}, the Sisters of Synnoria were in service to Prince [[Tristan Kendrick]] of [[Corwell]]. Later, they were involved in was the [[Battle of Freeman's Down]] and the siege of [[Caer Corwell]], both against the [[Bloodriders]], [[undead]] horsemen that served azgaroth the Beast.\n\nSynnoria was attacked by the [[Ityak-Ortheel]] in [[1365 DR]] when [[Malar]] and [[Talos]] sent it through a portal but the elf-eater was defeated and banished back to the [[Abyss]] after it had destroyed Argen-Tellirynd, the Palace of Ages.<ref>\n\nLegends among the Llewyrr foretold a resurgence would one day bring them back to dominance of the Moonshaes, but they always doubted this legend until it proved true when the entire island of [[Gwynneth]] was taken over by High Lady [[Ordalf]] of the leShay, leading to humans being banned from its shores beginning in [[1375 DR]]. Even so, their demographic challenges continued, and males comprised only a quarter of the population by the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n\nThe Llewyrr came to swear fealty to the High Lady of Sarifal over the crown of Evermeet."
