        "Description": "The average D'tarig stood little more than {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}}. They had somewhat puggish noses and wrinkled brows.\n\nD'tarig dressed in white [[wikipedia:en:Burnous|burnooses]] and wore [[turban]]s. On their feet, they often wore special widened [[sandal]]s designed to make walking atop sand easier. They usually covered their mouths with cloth so that only their nose and eyes were visible.\n\nWhile the [[Bedine]] tribes were perhaps more (in)famous, it was actually more likely for an outsider to the great desert to encounter a D'tarig tribesman than a [[Bedine]] one.",
        "Personality": "{{fq\n| float  = right\n| text   = If you have an infant son, and the son dies when a D'tarig is in town, the D'tarig will show up claiming to be the son of your son, and try to take everything you own.\n| source = A supposed [[Sembia]]n merchant\n}}\nD'tarig tended to be proud and boastful about their expertise of desert survival, making claims that were far from the truth. They were a naturally suspicious people, and because of this believed that they were immune to trickery, yet they were expert tricksters themselves. They typically had back-up plans and back-up plans for their back-up plans, so as not to be caught. They tended to selfishness, sometimes cruelty, and cowardice, but they were not without a sense of humor. They switched loyalties to whoever was willing to pay them the most.\n\nThey did not inherit any of the stonecraft of their supposed [[Dwarf|dwarven]] ancestors, but a rare few individuals had a superb sense of direction that was almost preternatural.",
        "Society": "The D'tarig lived primarily on the eastern and southeastern edges of the Anauroch. They were a nomadic people, but also kept several homes, usually one in one of the major trading villages of [[Addas Babar]] or [[Tel Badir]] and a protected abode for their families within mountain caves, the paths to which were often set with [[trap]]s.\n\nThey survived by herding [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s and would occasionally trade with the folk of [[Tilverton]], before that town's destruction. They also traded with the [[Zhentarim]]. D'tarig who traded metal to the Bedine in exchange for resins and [[spices]] were known as \"desert walkers\", and the spices were in turn sold to the Zhentarim, and in turn to merchants all over [[Faer没n]].\n{{fq\n| float  = left\n| text   = Only a fool strays from his path to search out another man's trouble.\n| source = A common D'tarig saying\n}}\nIn general, however, they avoided contact with other humans, driven by their mistrust of others.

        "Combat": "Because of their short height, D'tarig could not wield heavy weapons or swords longer than [[short sword]]s. Warriors armed themselves with poisoned [[javelin]]s and [[crossbow]] [[bolt]]s. They had a unique poison that they employed, the preparation of which was a secret to their people. It induced sleep in humans but was fatal to [[orc]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, and some other [[humanoid]]s.",
        "Language": "The D'tarig spoke [[D'tarig language|their own language]].<ref name=D:SiT-p26>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}",
        "Religion": "The D'tarig worshiped the [[Faer没nian pantheon|same gods typically worshiped in the rest of Faer没n]].",
        "History": "It was considered possible that the D'tarig were descended from humans and dwarves living in the area of [[Tethyamar]]."
