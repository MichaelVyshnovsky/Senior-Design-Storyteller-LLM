This article assumes that it takes place around the time of the second and third editions, based on the time period when the material was released. the ancestors of the Nubari came to [[Abeir-Toril]] on [[spelljammer]]s from another world, fleeing a great celestial war in search of peace. These \"Ancients\" chose the jungles of [[Malatra]] as their new home, because of its isolation from the rest of [[Toril]].\n\nThe Ancients developed a utopia in isolation atop the Malatran Plateau, but eventually, an unknown disaster struck, destroying their peaceful civilization. Those Ancients who survived had to return to primitive ways of life in the jungle.\n\nEventually, native humans (related to the [[Shou]]) from the jungles surrounding the plateau managed to climb its cliffs. They intermingled with the surviving Ancient Nubari and, over a time period of thousands of years, formed a new race of Nubari humans, which came to be the dominant ethnic group of the region."
