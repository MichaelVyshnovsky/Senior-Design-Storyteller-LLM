        "mainbody": "'''Damarans''' were an ethnic group of [[human]]s that were prominent in [[Damara]], within the [[Bloodstone Lands]], as well as several other regions in the [[Cold Lands]] and [[Northeast Faerûn|northeastern]] [[Faerûn]] as a whole. They were descendants from the integration of the [[Nar]]s, [[Rashemi]] and [[Sossrim]] tribes that were scattered following the fall of [[Netheril]], along with their migrating [[Chondathan]] cousins.\n\nThey also made up large portions of the northern and north-eastern realms of [[Impiltur]], [[Thesk]] and [[the Vast]].",
        "Description": "Ethnic Damarans were of average height and build for humans, with skin tones that ranged from fair to tawny. Their hair was usually brown or black, and their eye color varied widely, though brown was most common. Those who lived south of the [[Earthfast Mountains]] tended to more closely resemble Chondathans, while those from [[Vaasa]] appeared more like the Sossrim people.",
        "Culture": {
            "Outlook": "They tended to view life as a series of challenges that had to be overcome. Trust and respect were never freely given, but earned, and life was meant to be spent in the services of a greater good. The history of their people was never revered and nobles were not placed upon a golden pedestal; rather, the failures of their forebears served as lessons against the hubris of unchecked power. \n\nTrue heroism and self-sacrifice was held in the highest regard among the Damaran people. People were judged by their actions rather than their birth, as was common within other cultures.",
            "Religion": "The church was central in the lives of the Damaran people, and as such they tended to live a disciplined lifestyle, with stark sense of morality. Many people eschewed personal gain in favor of dedication to one of the deities popular in the northeast, such as [[Ilmater]] in Damara, or [[Chauntea]]. \n\nDespite the prominence of faith in the lives of the Damaran people, there was no universally-shared religion. While religious fervor and passion were greatly admired, Damarans were largely regarded by their individual code of conduct.",
            "Magic": "As a whole, Damarans had a strong affinity for [[divine magic]] and many chose the [[priest]]ly life. Those that studied the [[arcane]] arts largely preferred [[spell]]s from the [[abjuration]] and [[divination]] [[schools of magic]]. \n\nFew of their people were born with inherent [[sorcerer|sorcerous]] abilities, though those that did could likely trace their bloodline back to ancient Narfell."

            "Animals": "[[Dog]]s and [[horse]]s were heavily favored among the Damaran people. Many canines were bred as working dogs that pulled sleds, herded livestock and aided in hunting. In addition to a variety of horse breeds, [[griffon]]s were employed as a more exotic variety of mount."
        },
        "History": "The Damaran people were descended from the [[Netherese]] of [[Low Netheril]], whose empire collapsed in the 4{{th}} century before [[Dale Reckoning]]. Over time, the intermingling of the Nar, Rashemi, Chondathan and Sossrim peoples combined together, creating the Damaran ethnic group. Their culture evolved with heavy influence from Chondathan immigrants and dwarven merchants."
