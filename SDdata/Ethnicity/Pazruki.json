        "Description": "The members of these tribes were usually slight and thin. They had straight black hair, but they usually sheared their natural hair off. Instead, the women usually wore wigs, and the men fake beards. The origin of this custom was unknown, but some speculated that it was to deal with infections of [[lice]].",

Occasionally, however, one would feel the call of magic and go into the wilderness to become an [[wu jen]].\n\nThey also held the monastery of [[Palevash]] in high regard."
