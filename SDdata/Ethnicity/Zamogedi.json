They were among the tribes mistakenly called \"Tuigan\" by outsiders following the Horde Wars.\nThe Zamogedi lived in the eastern Hordelands near Shou Lung, near the Tuigan tribe. Their lands also bordered those of the Gurs, the Fankiang, and the Quirish.\nThey spoke their own language.\nThey were a highly warlike tribe and were known to disrespect the elves of the Pleasant Valley Gateway Oasis and often raided them.\nThe Zamogedi shared a common ancestor with the Quirish peoples.\nBefore the rise of the Tuigan to dominance, the Zamogedi held much territory in the northern steppes. During this time, there were many marriages between the the Zamogedi and the Naican, solidifying the friendship between these two people groups."
