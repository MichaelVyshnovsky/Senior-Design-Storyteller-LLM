        "mainbody": "he Kashghun were a tribe of humans living on the Plain of Horses in northwestern Kara-Tur or the northeastern Hordelands. They were among the tribes mistakenly called \"Tuigan\" by outsiders following the Horde Wars.The name of the tribe is variously spelled as \"Kahghun\", \"Khaghun\", and \"Kaghun\" (one each) in The Horde and as \"Kashghun\" (6), \"Kashgun\" (1), and \"Kahghun\" (4 times), in Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms. It is clear they are the same tribe, but the exact spelling is unclear. The spelling \"Kashghun\" is adopted here as it is the most common. They were one of the three major tribes of the plain, alongside the Fankiang and the Tsu-tsu.\nThe Kashghun lived in the southern Plain of Horses, over much of the northern Quoya Desert. Their territory bordered the lands of the Fankiang, Quirish, Oigur, and Tsu-tsu tribes. They made their home around the city of Chegoyui, the largest settlement in the northeastern  Quoya Desert\nThey spoke the Kashghun dialect of the Chuchian tongue.The Horde lists \"Khaghun\" as a language in its own right, but the Kara-Tur sources discuss this as only a dialect of the Chuchian language.\nThe Kashghun were traders and from Chegoyui they controlled all trade routes between the Plain of Horses and Shou Lung. The Kashghun ran huge caravans of several hundred camels across the desert.\nA peaceful people, the Kashghun tried not to get caught up in the inter-tribe rivalries and warfare that were common on the Plain of Horses, and generally they succeeded. had a treaty with the Tsu-tsu tribe (though neither paid it much mind), and enjoyed fairly good relations with Shou Lung.\nLong ago, a great leader of the steppe called a couralitai (a grand council of the khans), with all the tribes in attendance. During a heated argument at the council, the khan of the Commani and his sons were assassinated. The murderers escaped and were never discovered, but, after finding evidence against them, the Commani suspected the Kashghun and that the Fankiang protected the assassins. This led to hatred between the three groups, which lasted even into the midâ€“14 century.\nSome time around , the Tsu-tsu and Kashghun made a treaty against the Fankiang tribe. Their plan was to attack the city of Li-Raz from opposite sides and conquer the Fankiang there. While the Tsu-tsu launched their assault from the north, the Kashghun changed their minds at the last minute and abandoned the battle, forcing the Tsu-tsu to withdraw also. As a result, although the treaty remained in effect a century later, its terms were almost empty.\n* Marash Rashi, an aged livestock trader\n* Razak Irdi, a horse thief"
