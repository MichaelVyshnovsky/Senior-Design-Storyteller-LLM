'''Chultan dwarves''', or '''dwarves of the Domain''' as they called themselves, were [[albino]] [[dwarves]] that once lived in vast mines and other communities, deep beneath the land of [[Chult]].

==Description==
The dwarves of Chult that lived underground were albinos; their hair and skin were white, and they had pink eyes. This meant that they were very sensitive to the hot sun of Chult and therefore only came above ground at night. They were otherwise physically similar to their northern cousins,<ref name=TJoC-p5/> albeit a bit shorter on average.

==Personality==
Chultan dwarves were even more somber and grumpy on average than the dwarves of the northern realms. They were not especially violent, but they would defend their homes and mines at any cost.

==Society==
Most Chultan dwarves lived deep below the surface of Chult, centered in a community known as [[the Domain]].

These dwarves made use of the [[dinosaur]]s of the surface as pack animals in their mining operations. Their culture revolved around the wealth of their subterranean mines, and they were superb craftsmen, particularly when working with gems and precious metals.

===Culture===
Chultan dwarves put more importance into heritage and status of one's birth, rather than their capabilities as a leader or member of their society.

They also maintained their own written language, distinct from that of dwarves to the north. 

===Trade===
[[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]] superstitions equated the color white with death, so Chultan dwarves were often feared by the [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] [[human]]s.

Their usual trade partners were the [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s from the [[Dimetrodon Clan]]. The dwarves received food, skins, and ivory from the goblins in exchange for gems.

The Chultan dwarves also sold [[diamond]]-edged weapons to surface folk, including [[axe]]s, [[short sword]]s, and [[spear]]s.
==History==
Throughout much of their history, the dwarves of Chult suffered terribly at the hands of the jungle-dwelling [[yuan-ti]].

In 15{{th}} century [[DR]], sometime after the {{YearlinkName|1479}},
