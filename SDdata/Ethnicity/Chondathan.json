        "mainbody": "'''Chondathans''' were one of the more common [[human]] ethnicities, found in great number throughout the [[Western Heartlands|Western]] and [[Eastern Heartlands]]. They were a hardy, risk-taking folk who were apt to travel or take on new endeavors to better their lives and those of their loved ones.Their prominence throughout the Realms was due in large part to the extensive trade routes they established, rather than military conquest.",
        "Description": "The Chondathans of [[Faerûn]] were known for their affinity for the mercantile life. They were skilled and cunning traders, who judged the people they met in their many travels based the wealth and influence they had acquired. Despite their proclivity for commerce, they were a people of their word, if only for their reputation's sake rather than any moral reasoning.\n\nThey were a slender, tawny or fair-skinned people with brown hair that ranged from a light, almost-blond hue to a darker color that could be mistaken for black. Chondathans were often somewhat taller than other humans, though not in all instances, and often had green or brown eyes. Those living north and west of the [[Inner Sea]] tended to resemble the lighter-skinned [[Illuskan]]s while those who inhabited the lands south of the body of water had the darker skin that was common of the [[Netherese]]-descended ethnic groups.",
        "Culture": {
            "Animals": "Felines were widely viewed as good luck among the Chondathan people, preferred personal pets and wilderness companions, particularly [[lynx]]es and [[tressym]]s. [[Horse]]s were important to daily life and [[dog]]s were kept for their ability to aid with personal security, herding and hunting.",
            "Language": "The widest-recognized trade language of Faerûn, [[common]], was a sign of the widespread Chondathan culture. In addition they spoke the closely-related [[Chondathan language|Chondathan dialect]], which shared usage of the [[Thorass alphabet]] with the common language.",
            "Education": "Literacy and knowledge were highly valued in Chondathan societies, and children were educated whenever possible. Most children began serving as apprentices by the age of 12, expected to learn a trade and hold their own within the family and society as a whole. Literacy was much more prevalent among Chondathan-dominant lands.",
            "Magic": "Unlike the human ethnic groups that were derived from the ancient [[Netherese]], Chondathans had no strong bloodlines that had [[sorcerer|sorcerous]] ancestry, nor did they have significant traditions related to the [[arcane]] arts. They tended to favor [[magic]]al items which granted them a certain level of comfort and security, allowing them to protect their accumulated wealth and personal beings, especially from elves. There were few magical items unique to the Chondathan culture, save for the ''[[catseye brooch]]'', a charm that was symbolic of their affection for cats.",
            "Religion": "Chondathans revered all the deities of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]], and none of the deities were particularly favored over others. Due to the high value placed on education in Chondathan society, many literate people especially venerated the god [[Deneir]], whose faith was spread across Faerûn along with the [[Thorass languages]], via traveling Chondathan traders."
        },
        "Relations": "Thanks to their mutual proclivity for trade, the Chondathan nations maintained good relations with the [[dwarves]], [[gnome]]s, and [[halfling]]s of the Realms. They were well regarded and got along with other humans, especially societies of the [[Calishite]], [[Damaran]], [[Shaaran]], [[Tethyrian]], and [[Turami]] people. Chondathan culture had a major influence on Damaran, [[Vaasan]], and Tethyrian heritage.\n\nWith the exception of the peoples from the Dales and Cormyr, few Chondathans had good relationships with the elves or [[half-elves]] of Faerûn, and were cold and distant towards the [[Mulan]] of [[East Faerûn|the east]] and [[Illuskan]]s of [[the North]]. They were highly suspicious of [[planetouched]] and outright prejudiced against [[half-orc]]s.",
        "History": "The Chondathan people were descendants of ancient [[Jhaamdath]], an ancient kingdom of latter-day [[Vilhon Reach]] that dated back over 5,000 years before the erecting of the [[Standing Stone]] in the [[Dalelands]]. In {{Yearlink|-255}}, the Twelve Cities of Swords were demolished by a colossal tidal wave that was conjured by the [[elves]] of [[Nikerymath]] in response to the aggressive conquests of the [[Jhaamdath]]an people. The survivors of this catastrophic event settled the lands of north and northeast of the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]].\n\nAround the year [[1 DR]], a great number of Jhaamdath-descended Chondathans migrated west from [[Impiltur]]. A portion of them settled in the valleys near the great forest of [[Cormanthor]], which came to be known as the Dalelands, while a second group established roots in the region north of the [[Dragonmere]] and went on to found the [[Forest Country]] in [[26 DR]] under the leadership of [[Obarskyr|House Obarskyr]]. A third group left their ancient lands some time around [[380 DR]] and settled the south-eastern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars and established a collection of colonies known as [[Chancelgaunt]]. In the next few centuries, settlers from these [[Eastern Heartlands|heartlands]] continued further west and began to colonize the [[Savage Frontier]] in [[northwest Faerûn]].",
        "Regions": "Chondathans made up the bulk of the population of [[Altumbel]], [[Chondath]], [[Cormyr]], the Southern Dalelands, the [[Dragon Coast]], the [[Great Dale]], [[Hlondeth]], the northern shore of the [[Vilhon Reach]], the [[Pirate Isles]] of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], [[Sembia]], and [[Sespech]]."
