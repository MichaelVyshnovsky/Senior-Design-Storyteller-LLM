        "mainbody": "The Tayanulchi, also spelled Tayanuchi, were a tribe of humans living in the Ama Basin in the Northern Wastes of Kara-Tur. They split from the Issacortae and disappeared into the Land of the Snow Demons centuries before the 14th century DR.Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms, pages 93 and 94, discuss the Tayanulchi (with an l) as a lost tribe by 1357 DR, but The Horde, page 25, refers to the Tayanuchi (with no l), implying they are a tribe currently dwelling in the Ama Basin around 1359 DR. Although these might possibly refer to two different yet similarly named tribes in the Ama Basin, this article assumes they are the same tribe for simplicity. As The Horde only refers to a Tayanuchi homeland and locations of their campsites, and says nothing about the people, it may be considered to be an out-of-date perspective or referring only to abandoned Tayanulchi lands. Alternatively, the Tayanulchi/Tayanuchi may have returned or become known again between 1357 and 1359 DR.\nHaving broken off from the Issacortae, the Tayanulchi likely spoke the Issacortae language."
