The '''Quirish''' were a tribe of nomadic [[human]]s living in the [[Hordelands]].

==Territory==
The Quirish lived in the central region of the Hordelands. Their territory bordered the lands of the [[Oigur]], [[Tuigan]], [[Zamogedi]], [[Fankiang]], and [[Kashghun]] tribes.

==Society==
They spoke [[Quirish language|their own language]].

They were considered rivals of the Fankiang but were strongly allied with the Zamogedi. They sometimes raided the [[Naican]]s.

==History==
The Quirish were descended from the same ancestors as the Zamogedi. Their strong blood ties led to a lasting alliance.

For many long years, the Fankiang had raided the Quirish, and ''vice versa''. The Quirish, being a smaller tribe, were at a disadvantage.
