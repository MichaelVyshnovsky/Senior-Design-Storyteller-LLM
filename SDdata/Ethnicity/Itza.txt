The '''Itzas''' were a [[human]] people of [[Far Payit]] in the southeast of [[Maztica]]. They were a sub-grouping of the [[Payit (ethnicity)|Payit]] race.

==Description==
The name "Itza" came from the name of their greatest city, [[Tulom-Itzi]]. These people were known for their learned and peaceful culture. In fact, anyone who performed an act of violence was banished from society.

In ages past, the Itzas produced great works of architecture, including observatories for the study of the sky above. They were skilled in the working of [[gold]] and [[jade]]. They delighted in the creation of water fountains, which made use of [[pluma]] magic. Even a small Itza village might include such a fountain.

The Itzas loved colors, both in fabric and in feathers, and were especially interested in colors not found in nature.

As an offshoot of the Payit race, the Itzas were a stout folk. Despite their muscular appearance, they tended to be weaker than other humans, yet they were quite dexterous and more intelligent and wise than other races.

==Language==
The Itzas spoke the [[Payit language]].

==Society==
Most Itzas lived in communal villages with no central form of government and organized by clan. A honored warrior or priest might be given the title of "headman", but he was not a true ruler.

Only two true cities remained in Far Payit, Tulom-Itzi and [[Maxal]]. Those Itzas living in the cities similarly did not have strong central leadership. The major difference between life in the cities compared to that in the small villages was that the cities had large markets.

The Itzas would trade with outsiders for the necessities they could not acquire themselves, such as [[obsidian]] from [[Nexal]] or [[Pezelac]]. In exchange, the Itzas possessed tropical feathers highly sought by other peoples of Maztica.

Marriages and occupations were freely chosen among the Itza youth, although they often chose to follow family traditions.

Slavery was not present in Far Payit, nor would an Itza survive long as a slave, so highly did they value freedom.

==Religion==
The Itzas' faith in [[Qotal]] was stronger than that of the other peoples of Maztica, and he had many priests.

The Itzas used to practice human sacrifice to the god [[Kukul]], but by [[1358 DR]], such things had not been practiced in over a century.

Many talismans were crafted by the Itzas, using both pluma and [[hishna]] magics.

==Warfare==
While the Itzas despised war, they would defend themselves if attacked and if there were no alternatives to reaching peace. Itza warriors specialized in the [[short bow]] and used [[spear]]s in melee combat.
