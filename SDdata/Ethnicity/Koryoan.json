        "mainbody": "The '''Koryoan''' people were an ethnicity of [[human]]s who lived in the land of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. They were decendants of the ancient [[Han people]]. The Koryoans formed the kingdoms of [[Silla]], [[Koguryo]], and [[Saishu]], later provinces of the Empire of Koryo in the 14th century [[DR]]. They were sometimes nicknamed \"Cold Koryoans\".",
        "Language": "They spoke the [[Koryo language]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} It descended from the ancient [[Han language]] and its vocabulary comprised many words evolved from that tongue, as well as loanwords from [[Wa-an language|Wa-an]] and [[Kao te Shou]] that had been borrowed over centuries. Owing to its similarities, it was easy to find Koryoan translators for many languages, though few learned [[Kozakuran language|Kozakuran]], owing to enmity between the peoples.",
        "Description": "The Koryoan people tended to have black hair and high cheekbones, and had moderate heights and builds; they most closely resembled the people of [[Chukei]] province in northern [[Shou Lung]].{{Cite dragon/315/Kara-Tur: Ancestor Feats and Martial Arts Styles|63}}",
        "Attitudes": "They were a proud folk, known to be fearless in a fight and exuberant in a celebration. However, the people were molded by a history of war and invasion and of living under threats of such. They were always alert, but tended toward xenophobia, preferring to trust a fellow Koryoan over a stranger. It wasn't unknown for one to wrongly blame a foreigner for some crime, rather than suspect or doubt one of their own people.",
        "Culture": {
            "Relations": "The Koryoans bore a great enmity for the [[Kozakuran people]], their culture, and even their language,<ref group=\"note\">The wars between Koryo and Kozakura are not mentioned at all in the Kozakuran chapter of ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'', nor in any other source to deal with Kozakura, so the cause and nature of these conflicts are unknown.\n\nThe Koryoans also regularly beat back invasions by the wild tribes of the northern [[Koryo Peninsula]].\n\nThe Koryoans were on peaceful terms with neighboring [[Wa]], with [[Wanese]] traders and their currency seen in Koryoan ports."
