        "mainbody": "The Rengarth were a barbarian human people who lived in Netheril in the harsh regions below the Netherese cities north of the Narrow Sea and Zenith during the Shadowed Age.\nThe Rengarth subsisted primarily on tundra grasses, caribou, moose, mice, mammoth, and muskoxen. They used mammoths as both mounts and beasts of burden, as they had a particular skill at handling them and a peculiar affinity for them that the Netherese believed was like an animal friendship spell.\nThe Rengarth hated magic in all its forms, to a fanatical degree. An exception was that used by their shamans, which they saw as holy and sacred. Their hatred extended to the ownership and use of non-divine magic items, the definition of which the shamans, whose view on magic was narrow, decided for the people. Typically, this was just about anything the shaman could not make themselves.\nA member of the Rengarth who reached the age adulthood and achieved warrior status undertook a rite of passage. They consumed a powder of secret origin and went on a three-day-long dream-walk. After that time, an animal spirit would appear and guide them out of this state. There was only a 75% chance of one appearing failure would result in never acquiring an animal spirit guide. Those who succeeded and found such a guide gained a good sense of direction and the chance to gain one of the animal natural abilities for an hour each week.\nCirca , the Rengarth fighter Sunbright Steelshanks caught the attention of the Netherese wizards, Candlemas and Sysquemalyn.\n* Sunbright Steelshanks"
