They were dexterous but not overly strong.\nAs a rule, the Green Folk were private people. In fact, few who entered their forests were ever seen again.\nThe Green Folk were organized into separate villages and did not have a nation of their own These villages were scattered through the jungles of the Southern Wilds.\nThe Green Folk worshiped gods of nature, such as Maztica, Nula, Qotal, or Watil, but they did not practice human sacrifice.\nThey were highly skilled in the use of bow and arrow, and they often tipped their arrows with kurari poison.\nWhen they took prisoners, they only rarely let them live."
