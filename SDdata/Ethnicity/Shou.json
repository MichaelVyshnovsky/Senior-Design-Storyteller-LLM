        "mainbody": "The Shou were humans originally from the Empire of Shou Lung in the eastern lands of Kara-Tur. By 1360 DR, many Shou migrated to Thesk and other lands of Faerûn. Many cities, such as Phsant, Telflamm, Marsember, and Westgate, had \"Shou Town\" districts within their walls, and the Shou nation of Nathlan in the Dragon Coast was founded in the aftermath of the Spellplague of 1385 DR.\nShou bore a similar appearance to that of the Tuigan. They had yellowish-bronze skin, black hair, and broad, flat features.\nThe Shou enclave of Xiousing in Marsember was founded around 1419 DR when the waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars receded. Duc-Sum Li was granted regency of the newly created land as a boon from King Azoun V of Cormyr. The district was a crowded, lively place and was like a piece of Kara-Tur transported to Cormyr.  \nThe Shou favored a type of green tea, West Lake Dragon Well, that was considered to be the way to ones heart. With the influx of the Shou population, this drink was gaining popularity in Faerûn.\nthumb|319x319px|A Shou of the Unapproachable East.\nThe Shou language, High Shou, used the Draconic alphabet.\nThe Shou typically worshiped a pantheon of deities known as the Celestial Bureaucracy.\nThe Shou believed that if surviving relatives and descendants paid respect to their dead, the dead exercised a benevolent influence over the family, granting prosperity, happiness, and health. A typical Shou household had a small shrine, where small carved representations of one or more dead relatives were kept. While a few shrines were populated with a plethora of figures with letters and prayers addressed to dead ancestors, most Shou households kept only one intricately carved figure to represent all the loved ones lost."
