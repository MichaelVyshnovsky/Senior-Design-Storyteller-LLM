The '''Sossrims''' were the inhabitants of [[Sossal]]. They were said to be distant relatives of the [[Frost Folk]].

{{Quote|''Strange folk, the Sossrim -- strange magic, that is. I know they can jump from tree to tree as [[druid]]s down here do. . . but I've never been across the glaciers to get there. Very few have, and they don't seem eager to welcome anyone. Hardy folk, who think nothing of striding out alone in fierce blizzards.''|Anonymous [[Harper]] agent<ref>{{Cite web/geocities/Ed Says: Geography of the Realms}}}}

==Description==
Sossrim had snow-white skin, or silver in color.

<nowiki> </nowiki>Sossrim typically dressed in white clothing. Some were known to wear [[cloak]]s made from the pelts of [[polar bear]]s, with their heads left intact to act as a headcovering.

==History==
The Sossrim were founded by a clan of [[Rashemi]] warriors led by [[Soss]] in {{Yearlink|-2320}}. This clan migrated north, traded with the [[dwarves]] of [[Dareth]], and eventually settled in the alpine valleys of the [[Armridge Mountains]], bordering the [[Great Glacier]].

In [[-1967 DR]], during the [[First Mulhorand-Unther War]], the Sossrim were employed as mercenaries by both nations.

During the [[Orcgate Wars]], many Sossrim fought as mercenaries in the armies of [[Mulhorand]] alongside the [[Raumviran]]s and the [[Rashemi]].<ref>

In the {{YearlinkName|-300}}, the Sossrim living in the Armridge Mountains fought back an invasion of [[frost giants]] led by the chieftain [[Orbrud of the Pines]]. They managed to drive the giants back, thanks to the help of wind [[genasi]] warriors that were sent by [[Arkhan Tallos]] of [[Raumathar]]. In gratitude for this aid, the Sossrim pledged fealty to his nation.

In the {{YearlinkName|331}}, the Sossrim living around the Great Glacier were united by [[Ylaethar|Ylaethar "The Bear"]], who proclaimed himself king. They went on lead the Sossrim south from their ancestral lands and found the nation of Sossal.
