        "mainbody": "The Ulutiuns were a grouping of related races of humans who inhabited the far polar regions of Faerûn.\nUlutiuns had dark, light brown,\nUlutiun males did not grow facial hair, and men and women had more fat under their skin than other humans and extra blood vessels in their extremities. These adaptive variations granted them a special resistance to living in the frigid weather of the polar regions.\nThey wore thick clothing made from furs and hides.\nUlutiuns were an adaptable people and lived close to nature. They tended to be warm and friendly once one got to know them.\nUlutiuns were divided into four sub-groupings. The Ice Hunters lived in the west, in the regions of the the Cold Run, the Ice Peak, and the Sea of Moving Ice. The Angulutiuns, Iulutiuns, and Nakulutiuns resided in the Great Glacier.\nThe Ice Hunters spoke Uluik, and the Ulutiuns of the Great Glacier spoke Ulutiun. Both were closely related languages.\nThe Ice Hunters venerated various nature spirits and had a shamanistic form of religion. Iulutiuns and Angulutiuns did not have a religion, but the Nakulutiuns worshiped Ulutiu.\nSince metal was rare on glaciers, Ulutiun warriors had inferior weapons and armor compared to the peoples of the Cold Lands to the south, yet they were known for being ferocious in battle with a unparalleled ability to survive their arctic climates. They favored spears. If forced to fight, they battled to the death.\nUlutiuns were originally from the lands of Kara-Tur and migrated west to Faerûn over the ice over a thousand years before the Dalereckoning."
