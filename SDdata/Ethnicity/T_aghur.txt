The Taghurs were a nomadic tribe of humans living on the Plain of Horses in northwestern Kara-Tur or the northeastern Hordelands. They were among the tribes mistakenly called "Tuigan" by outsiders following the Horde Wars.
They made their home around the city of Alamaqu in the central  Chigidi Mountains.
They were a highly mobile tribe who followed their sheep herds with the seasons and the search for green grazing land. Their city, Alamaqu, was little more than a vast campsite containing thousands of tents, the distinctive white ger favored by the Taghurs. In the winter, the Taghurs packed up their tents and drove their sheep herds to greener fields, leaving Alamaqu nearly empty.
They were only a minor tribe of the Plain of Horses. Unique among the Plainsmen, the Taghurs were led by a triumvirate. The tribes founders had felt that three equal leaders would be better than a lone qaghan, and the system stood for centuries. However, Taghur society grew sluggish without one farsighted leader to give them direction, while the triumvirates poor administration inhibited their prosperity. One example was when the triumvirate decided to adopt war elephants as a cavalry though they proved to be too slow and too willful for Plainsmen warfare, the triumvirate obstinately refused to abandon the idea. 
They spoke the Chuchian tongue.
The Taghurs faith was a mixture of animism and ancestor worship and veneration of a sun god. To receive the sunrise and honor the sun, they always placed their tents with openings facing east. The first day of summer was their chief holy day and, once a year, all Taghurs undertook a pilgrimage back to their ancestral home to pray for a day.
Around , Taghur rebels at Alamaqu were planning to depose the tribes ruling triumvirate, when the traveling lama Torgoja Pa arrived and, in only days, persuaded the rebel leaders to give up their plan.
