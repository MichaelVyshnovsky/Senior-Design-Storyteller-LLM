The '''T'aghurs''' were a nomadic tribe of [[human]]s living on the [[Plain of Horses]] in northwestern [[Kara-Tur]] or the northeastern [[Hordelands]].{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|48}} They were among the tribes mistakenly called "[[Tuigan]]" by outsiders following the [[Horde Wars]].

==Home==
They made their home around the city of [[Alamaqu]] in the central  [[Chigidi Mountains]].

==Activities==
They were a highly mobile tribe who followed their [[sheep]] herds with the seasons and the search for green grazing land. Their city, Alamaqu, was little more than a vast campsite containing thousands of tents, the distinctive white ''ger'' favored by the T'aghurs. In the winter, the T'aghurs packed up their tents and drove their sheep herds to greener fields, leaving Alamaqu nearly empty.

==Society==
They were only a minor tribe of the Plain of Horses. Unique among the Plainsmen, the T'aghurs were led by a triumvirate. The tribe's founders had felt that three equal leaders would be better than a lone ''qaghan'', and the system stood for centuries. However, T'aghur society grew sluggish without one farsighted leader to give them direction, while the triumvirate's poor administration inhibited their prosperity. One example was when the triumvirate decided to adopt war [[elephant]]s as a cavalry; though they proved to be too slow and too willful for Plainsmen warfare, the triumvirate obstinately refused to abandon the idea. 

They spoke the [[Chuchian]] tongue.

==Culture==
The Taghurs' faith was a mixture of animism and ancestor worship and veneration of a [[sun]] [[god]]. To receive the sunrise and honor the sun, they always placed their tents with openings facing east. The first day of summer was their chief holy day and, once a year, all T'aghurs undertook a [[pilgrimage]] back to their ancestral home to pray for a day.

==History==
Around {{YearlinkConvert|2592|SY}}, T'aghur rebels at Alamaqu were planning to depose the tribe's ruling triumvirate, when the traveling [[lama]] [[Torgoja P'a]] arrived and, in only days, persuaded the rebel leaders to give up their plan.<ref>
