"'''Maztican'''" was a collective term used by [[Faerûn]]ians for any of the inhabitants of [[Maztica]]. When most folk in Faerûn used the term, they were most likely referring to [[Nexalan]]s, as that was the only people group of Maztica for which individuals had traveled to the east. In truth, there were seven separate ethnicities of humans in Maztica: 
* Nexalans
* [[Azuposi]]
* [[Dog People]]
* [[Green Folk]]
* [[Metahel]]
* [[Nahopaca]]
* [[Payit (ethnicity)|Payit]]s
