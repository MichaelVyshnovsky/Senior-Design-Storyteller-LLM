        "mainbody": "The Quirish were a tribe of nomadic humans living in the Hordelands.\nThe Quirish lived in the central region of the Hordelands. Their territory bordered the lands of the Oigur, Tuigan, Zamogedi, Fankiang, and Kashghun tribes.\nThey spoke their own language.\nThey were considered rivals of the Fankiang but were strongly allied with the Zamogedi. They sometimes raided the Naicans.\nThe Quirish were descended from the same ancestors as the Zamogedi. Their strong blood ties led to a lasting alliance.\nFor many long years, the Fankiang had raided the Quirish, and vice versa. The Quirish, being a smaller tribe, were at a disadvantage."
