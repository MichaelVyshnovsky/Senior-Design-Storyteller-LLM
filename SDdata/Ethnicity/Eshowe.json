        "mainbody": "The '''Eshowe''' ({{Pronounce|eh|SHOH|ay|refs=}}) were a [[Chult]]an tribe that was nearly extinct by [[1370 DR]].",
        "History": "The Eshowe were one of the tribes that [[couatl]]s led from the [[Dark Continent]] to meet the god [[Ubtao]] on the [[Peaks of Flame]] in {{Yearlink|-2809}}. They soon grew to become the one of the largest and most powerful tribes in Chult, second only to the [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]].\n\nThe [[-438 DR|Year of Dripping Daggers, &minus;438 DR]] saw the beginning of a terrible civil war between the Tabaxi and Eshowe tribes. It would continue for nearly 300 years. the Eshowe somehow released an ancient [[Shadow Giant]] called [[Eshowdow]], the \"Shadow of the Eshowe\", which attacked the Tabaxi capital and holy city of Ubtao, [[Mezro]]. After nearly annihilating Mezro, Eshowdow turned on its summoners and wiped out nearly all of the Eshowe warriors.\n\nAfter this, [[Ras Nsi]], one of the [[Chosen]] [[bara]]e of Ubtao, sought to wipe the surviving Eshowe from [[Toril]] in retaliation, and he nearly succeeded in this task, pursuing them all the way to the [[Valley of Lost Honor]].",
        "Society": "Like the [[Shadovar]] of [[Netheril]], many Eshowe became [[shade]]s, particularly [[priest]]s of Eshowdow and [[mage]]s known as [[Abuyaka]]s.\n\nThe [[Kenswa-Tokashow]] were a band of warriors who served as the elite troops of the Eshowe.",
        "Language": "The Eshowe spoke [[Eshowan]], which was unrelated to the language spoken by the Tabaxi.The \"Speaking in Tongues\" article in [[Dragon Magazine Annual 1999|''Dragon'' Annual #4]] does not directly state that it was the Eshowe who spoke Eshowan, but it is strongly implied by the spelling of the name and the fact that the Eshowe were extinct.",
        "Rumors and Legends": "Among the Tabaxi tribes, legends circulated that the Eshowe survivors were hidden somewhere in Chult, plotting their revenge."
