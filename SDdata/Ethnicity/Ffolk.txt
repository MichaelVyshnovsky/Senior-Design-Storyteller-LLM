The '''Ffolk''' were a race of [[human]]s that inhabited the [[Moonshae Isles]] alongside the [[Northlanders]]. The Ffolk inhabited the southern parts of the Moonshaes, including [[Flamsterd]], [[Moray]], [[Snowdown]], and [[Sunset]], and the southern parts of [[Alaron]] and [[Gwynneth]]. Their society was mainly agricultural and was ruled by a High King or Queen who resided in [[Caer Callidyrr]], the capital of the Ffolk.

==Culture and Heritage==
Modern Ffolk were mostly of [[Tethyrian]] origin, following a large Tethyrian immigration in [[467 DR]]. This caused the Ffolk to lose much of their original racial heritage, although their culture was quite distinct from their mainland cousins and they held to a strong [[druid]]ic tradition.<ref name=RoF-p106>

The Ffolk spent most of their time on peaceful pastimes such as farming, fishing, hunting, and trading. They were also accomplished shipbuilders, specializing in a type of ship that was designed to withstand some of the roughest seas.<ref name=FRCSv1-p64-65>

==Religion==
The Ffolk worshiped the Earthmother, an aspect of [[Chauntea]].

The Ffolk had a deep reverence for nature and the land around them, always respecting the divine power in a misty forest, a rushing river or even a hidden pool.

==Language==
Modern Ffolk spoke [[Illuskan language|Illuskan]], and they employed the [[Thorass alphabet|Thorass]] script.<ref name=RoF-p106 /> 

The druids of the Moonshaes spoke [[Waelan]], the original language of the Ffolk.<ref name=D:SiT-p26>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}<ref>{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}

==History==
The first Ffolk to appear on the Moonshae Isles were members of the lost tribes of [[Talfir]] who fled [[Ebenfar]] to escape the Shadowking [[Verraketh]]. Their first settlement was in [[140 DR]], on a island they named [[Gwynneth]].<ref name=tGhotR-p63->

After defeating the creature known as [[Kazgoroth]], [[Cymrych Hugh]] was crowned king of the Moonshae Isles in [[201 DR]].<ref name=tGhotR-p68>

The Ffolk controlled the isles up until an invasion by [[Illuskan]]s forced them to concede the northern section of the isles in [[256 DR]].<ref name=tGhotR-p68 />

In [[621 DR]], Ffolk colonized the [[Utter East]] and enslaved the native [[Mar]] of the area, carving it up into the [[Five Kingdoms]].<ref name=tGhotR-p93>

==Lands==
Their settlements formed a small kingdom on the Moonshaes, ruled by the High Queen [[Alicia Kendrick]] in the late 1300s DR.

==Description==
The Ffolk were considered to have darker skin and hair than the [[Northlanders]].

==Relations==
The Ffolk had a long-term conflict with the other group of people who inhabited the Moonshaes, the Northlanders.
