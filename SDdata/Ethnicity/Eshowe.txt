The Eshowe () were a Chultan tribe that was nearly extinct by 1370 DR.
The Eshowe were one of the tribes that couatls led from the Dark Continent to meet the god Ubtao on the Peaks of Flame in . They soon grew to become the one of the largest and most powerful tribes in Chult, second only to the Tabaxi.
The Year of Dripping Daggers, &minus438 DR saw the beginning of a terrible civil war between the Tabaxi and Eshowe tribes. It would continue for nearly 300 years. the Eshowe somehow released an ancient Shadow Giant called Eshowdow, the "Shadow of the Eshowe", which attacked the Tabaxi capital and holy city of Ubtao, Mezro. After nearly annihilating Mezro, Eshowdow turned on its summoners and wiped out nearly all of the Eshowe warriors.
After this, Ras Nsi, one of the Chosen barae of Ubtao, sought to wipe the surviving Eshowe from Toril in retaliation, and he nearly succeeded in this task, pursuing them all the way to the Valley of Lost Honor.
Like the Shadovar of Netheril, many Eshowe became shades, particularly priests of Eshowdow and mages known as Abuyakas.
The Kenswa-Tokashow were a band of warriors who served as the elite troops of the Eshowe.
The Eshowe spoke Eshowan, which was unrelated to the language spoken by the Tabaxi.The "Speaking in Tongues" article in Dragon Annual #4 does not directly state that it was the Eshowe who spoke Eshowan, but it is strongly implied by the spelling of the name and the fact that the Eshowe were extinct.
Among the Tabaxi tribes, legends circulated that the Eshowe survivors were hidden somewhere in Chult, plotting their revenge.
