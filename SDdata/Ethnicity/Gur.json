        "Description": "Like their [[Rashemi]] kin, Gurs were typically a stout, strong, and sturdy people, with thick black hair, dark eyes, and dusky skin.",
        "Society & Culture": "{{quote|The Gur know about lords like him—always persecuting our kind, blaming us for their crimes.|Therin}}\nBy the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Gurs were divided into two distinct cultures: those who traveled throughout the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]] and those living in the [[Hordelands|Endless Wastes]] and [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum|title=Questions for Eric L. Boyd|author=[[Thomas M. Costa]]|topicid=3803|postid=489081|whichpage=38|date=2016-11-22|accessdate=2017-04-02}} The eastern Gur lived around the [[Iceroot Forest]] in the shadow of the [[Hagga Shan]] and on the far western [[Plain of Horses]] to the south. Their lands lay between those of the Fankiang and Zamogedi tribes. A few of the western Gur also settled in some of the poorer sections of cities such as [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Elturel]], and [[Iriaebor]].\n\nThe Gurs of the Western Heartlands were arranged by large extended families. A nomadic people, they traveled from settlement to settlement in assorted caravans, picking up random jobs and selling or trading any unwanted goods. Some found work as soothsayers and diviners. Those few who settled in cities struggled to survive in their poorer quarters. Gur culture placed a high value on honor,{{Cite adventurers league/Suits of the Mists|5,6}} \"Moon-man\" was a particularly offensive slur to a Gur.<ref> For fighting, these Gur favored the [[Wikipedia:Sgian-dubh|skene]], long, slender type of [[dirk]].\n\n[[File:Hordelands tribal map.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A map of Hordelands tribal territories, showing that of the eastern Gur.'']]\n''Circa'' [[1359 DR]], the Gur of the Endless Wastes were on peaceful terms with the [[Oigur]], [[Zamogedi]], and [[Tuigan]] tribes and were in a conflict with the [[Fankiang]] tribe. The Gur were among the tribes mistakenly called \"[[Tuigan]]\" by outsiders following the [[Horde Wars]].",
        "Religion & Magic": "The Gurs of the Heartlands mainly followed [[Selûne]] the Moonmaiden, goddess of wanderers and navigation. They thought of themselves as \"children of Selûne\". However, some Gurs of prophetic bent were also known to worship [[Savras]], Lord of Divination, with a faith secretive to outsiders. This likely explained the survival of his faith during his long period of imprisonment. Thus, Gurs were often gifted oracles and known for their talent in divining, soothsaying, and fortune telling. Some Gur matriarchs adopted the title 'Maiden' after the legend of their origin.\n\nLike their [[Rashemi]] kin, some Gurs possessed \"the Sight\", an unreliable gift for glimpses of the past and snatches of history or even of the future. This was thought to be a lingering trait of their heritage among the [[Wychlaran]], the Witches of Rashemen, though they retained no other practice of their witchcraft.",

        "Population": "Gurs made up only about 1% of the human population of the Western Heartlands, but this was perhaps their greatest population in [[Faerûn]].",
        "History": "The western Gurs were believed by scholars to be mainly of Rashemi descent, owing to their strong similarity with the natives of [[Rashemen]]. They were also likely to have acquired ancestry among other ethnicities on their travels. Fragments of lore originating from the period around the 1{{st}} century [[DR]] could be found that described the Gurs as a group of nomads. What was known of the early Gurs suggested that they were refugees fleeing the long-ago war between [[Raumathar]] and [[Narfell]]. According to a Gur legend, recounted in ''[[The Approachable East]]'' vol. 3, two young maidens of the Wychlaran disobeyed their elders and so were punished by being transformed into songbirds and trapped within a golden cage, and were told that if they wouldn't learn then they could still make music. Somehow, the young witches escaped and winged their way across Faerûn until they grew too tired and finally stopped in a garden. The garden's owner, a [[cleric]] of Selûne, blessed them in the name of the Moonmaiden and restored them to human form. Thereafter, they became \"Selûne's children\" and all the Gur claimed descent from them.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1268}}, a group of Gurs attacked the [[high elf]] magistrate [[Astarion Ancunín]], though he was rescued by [[Cazador Szarr]].\n\nIn the Hordelands, when [[Yamun Khahan]] rose to power in the 1340s and 1350s DR, the Gurs there joined with his [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]] in hopes of improving their standing amongst the tribes of the Endless Wastes. They became loyal followers of Yamun and aided in his campaign against the Zamogedi. Because the Oigur were afraid of the anger of Yamun Khahan, they allied themselves with the Gur in supporting the Tuigan.\n\nThe Gurs were well known in the Western Heartlands of Faerûn in the 14{{th}} century and late 15th century [[DR]].\n\nIn the late 1400s DR, a large Gur community made ruined [[Harpshield Castle]] their winter meeting place. They constructed new wooden structures and a palisade, but departed the place ''circa'' [[1475 DR]] and did not return.<ref>\n\n''Circa'' [[1490 DR]], a Gur family, the Rasias—[[Hricu Rasia|Hricu]], [[Kehkim Rasia|Kehkim]], [[Ozzcar Rasia|Ozzcar]], [[Rilynin Rasia|Rilynin]], and [[Sybil Rasia|Sybil]]—stayed at the [[Crossing Inn]] outside [[Phlan]]. Initially well-behaved and well-liked, they later committed a series of thefts and druggings, angering many. But this was in an effort to seek powerful allies in the form of [[Jeny Greenteeth]] and others for protection before Sybil, the boy [[Quiver Plumm]], and some [[adventurer]]s were spirited into the [[Domains of Dread]].{{Cite adventurers league/Suits of the Mists}}\n\nIn the early 1490s DR, [[vampire spawn]] in the service of Cazador Szarr, a [[vampire lord]] in [[Baldur's Gate]], were attacking a local Gur community, killing their adults and kidnapping their children to turn into vampires. The Gur monster hunter Gandrel sought out the vampires, and in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Gur woman Ulma enlisted the aid of adventurers.",
