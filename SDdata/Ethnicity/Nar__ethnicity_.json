They had jet black hair that was naturally straight.",

        },
        "History": "The Nar existed as tribes as early as {{Yearlink|-2460}}, when the [[Great Glacier]] forced the nomadic tribes south, where they clashed with both [[hobgoblin]]s and [[elves]].\n\nThe Nar tribes were first discovered by [[Mulhorand]]i scouts when that nation began expanding into the north ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-1500}}. By the time of the [[Orcgate Wars]] nearly 500 years later, the Nars had been hired as mercenaries to fight in Mulhorand's armies.\n\nAfter the wars had ended, the Nar tribes returned to their native lands, inspired to forge their own kingdom. The most important of these kingdoms were [[Ashanath (kingdom)|Ashanath]] and [[Tharos]].\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-1015}}, [[Tharos Crell|Tharos]], the namesake of the Nar kingdom of the same name, led his tribe into the [[Riildath]] where they discovered the ruins of [[Narathmault]] and with it, many secrets of demonic lore left behind by the [[Ilythiir]]i.\n\nAround {{Yearlink|-970}}, the king ([[Nentyarch]]) of Tharos, [[Thargaun Crell|Thargaun]] son of Tharos,\n\nBy {{Yearlink|-946}}, Thargaun had fully united all of the individual Nar kingdoms into the empire of [[Narfell]], in what was called the [[Great Conflagration]].\n\nAfter the fall of the empire, the surviving Nars retreated into tiny enclaves in an attempt to defend themselves from the demons that they had unbound. Many of these tribes mixed with those of [[Rashemi]], [[Sossrim]], and [[Chondathan]] stock to become the [[Damaran]]s.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], the Nars who had not interbred consisted of more than twenty nomadic tribes living north of the [[Rawlinswood]] and east of the [[Giantspire Mountains]].",
        "Notable Nars": "* [[Abordabe (individual)|Abordabe]], chieftain of the largest Nar tribe (the [[Abordabe|Adordabe]]) in [[1359 DR]]\n* [[Thalaman Harthgroth]], the grizzled leader of the nomadic tribe of the same same ([[Harthgroth]]), he was also head of the tribal council that kept the peace between the many different tribes in [[1372 DR]].\n* [[Horse (individual)|Horse]], an infamous hunter in [[1359 DR]]\n* [[Thargaun Crell]], first wearer of the Crown of Narfell",
        "Rumors & Legends": "After the Great Conflagration, it was said that some Nar survivors wandered into an ancient forest where a powerful entity agreed to shelter them only if they agreed to give up their demon-summoning and receive the blood of the forest as their own. They accepted and were magically changed into the first of the [[volodni]]."
