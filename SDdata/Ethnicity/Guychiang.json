        "mainbody": "The '''Guychiang''' were a nomadic tribe of [[human]]s living on the [[Plain of Horses]] in northwestern [[Kara-Tur]] or the northeastern [[Hordelands]].{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|48}} They were among the tribes mistakenly called \"[[Tuigan]]\" by outsiders following the [[Horde Wars]].",
        "Home": "They made their home around the city of [[Peqqir]] in the [[Wikipedia:taiga|taiga]] of the northern Plain of Horses, near the foot of the [[Chigidi Mountains]] and with the [[Anai River]] flowing past.",
        "Activities": "Although a minor tribe of the Plain of Horses, the Guychiang were expert farmers who employed advanced irrigation methods to grow [[grain]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[cotton]], and [[mulberry]] trees, the leaves of which were used in the production of [[silk]]. In addition, they mined [[iron]] and [[jade]] from the nearby Chigidi Mountains and manufactured [[weapon]]s, quality jewelry, and [[leather]] products. They made Peqqir perhaps the most industrious settlement in all the Plain of Horses as of {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}} and were jealously protective of it.",
        "Society": "They spoke the [[Chuchian]] tongue.",
        "History": "After he first appeared in the Plain of Horses around {{YearlinkConvert|2592|SY}}, the nomad lama [[Torgoja P'a]] stopped in Peqqir, where he aided in the design of an irrigation project that would bring water to mulberry farms on mountain slopes. The grateful Guychiang offered to construct a temple in his honor, but P'a passed on it and continued on his way. He would become High Lama of Mount Or-Ghash around {{YearlinkConvert|2597|SY}}.<ref>"
