            "Languages": "Literacy was high among the Durpari people, as it was a requirement for the mercantile trade.

After [[Unther]]'s destruction in the [[Spellplague]], [[Untheric]] became widely spoken in Durpar and Estagund.<ref>{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Player's Guide|156}}",
            "Magic": "Magic, like other fantastical exhibitions, did not phase the Durpari people. They had a natural affinity for, and appreciation of, the schools of [[illusion]] and [[divination]]. They saw magic as a tool to aide in commerce, often employing illusions to aide in the comfort of trading partners or divining future market trends or safe caravan routes. A safe and comfortable life aided in the continued success of their trade.",
            "Religion": "{{See also|Adama}}\n\nAs well as having a natural connection to arcane magic, the Durpari were devout, often becoming [[paladin]]s or [[cleric]]s to their faith, the [[Adama]]. This inclusive spiritual belief system incorporated all aspects of their life, including tenets of virtuous behavior. Deities were venerated or shunned, but all were a part of this all-encompassing belief system."

        "History": "The Durpari dwelt in the southeast of [[Faerûn]] before the empire of [[Imaskar]], but when that civilization fell, the Durpari were thrust into a dark age during which the [[Mulhorandi]] hunted their tribes for slaves. The [[Mulan]] later turned their attention to defense against [[Narfell]] and [[Raumathar]], and the Durpari founded their first kingdoms in [[−623 DR]].\n\nThe Durpari then traded in peace for the next two thousand years, with the exception of [[Reinhar I]] of [[Dambrath]] occupying [[Estagund]] for a time in [[551 DR]]. They excelled at trade to the point of having no other rivals. As other cultures traveled by land and sea for Durpari goods, their culture has grown and flourished.\n\nFaith in the Adama was introduced by a traveling merchant named [[Satama]]. This set of principles and philosophy aided in the continued success of the Durpari people."
