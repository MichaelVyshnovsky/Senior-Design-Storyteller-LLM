'''Huroola''' was a matriarchal [[human]] [[Nubari]] tribe, known for its xenophobic and militaristic culture, that inhabited the southwestern edge of the [[Fire Mountain]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite polyhedron/102/Tribes of the Nubari|9-10}}

==Habitat==
[[File:Wise Ones map.png|thumb|370px|''A map showing the Huroola tribe territory.'']]
Huroola territories were bordered by the Fire Mountain foothills to the northeast and the shores of the [[Dreaming River]] to the south.

==Culture==
Huroola were a prideful{{Cite organized play/LJ/Come the Tiger|2}} and territorial people.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Huroola Prophet|3}} They once were male-dominated, a legacy that forged their xenophobia and militarism. Huroola had the best warriors and heroes of the Living Jungle, but they believed that they could tame the jungle and survive on their own without the aid of other Malatran tribes.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Come the Tiger|4}}{{Cite polyhedron/102/Tribes of the Nubari|9-10}}

Males of Huroola were entrusted with keeping homes, preparing food, maintaining fires, and protecting food storage via traps. None of these tasks was achieved with the use of [[spear]]s or [[dagger]]s, as males were forbidden to use any type of weapons. Men provided childcare as women patrolled and hunted during the day. Both Huroola males and females were rarely seen outside the tribe territories. Each village usually consisted of ten to thirty huts constructed of [[bamboo]] and hardened mud.

===Garb===
Men and women of Huroola dressed practically in light clothing made using animal hides. They wore brightly colored [[wood]]en and [[ceramic|clay]] jewelry affixed on leather thongs. When warriors ventured on hunting expeditions or entered battles, they covered their faces in blue mud and their hands with [[chalk]].

===Customs===
All males were barred from wielding weapons while within the Huroola lands. Male visitors were encouraged to stash their weapons somewhere before dealing with Huroola. Those who disrespected this law faced some of the cruelest and most violent punishments of the Living Jungle.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Come the Tiger|6}}

Traditionally, at least for several centuries, Huroola women took on the professions of warriors, hunters, and leaders. Males were considered untrustworthy to wield weapons of destruction and were delegated to positions of 'speakers of the dead,' [[witch doctor]]s, and [[shaman]]s. 'Speakers' effectively were [[priest]]s of the tribes, practicing ancestral worship and communing with spirits of generations gone. They dispensed wisdom, mitigating conflicts, and provided healing. In the distant past, the gender roles of the tribe were reversed, however, yet as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], some women still were known to become speakers.

==Government==
With the establishment of a matriarchy, the speakers of the dead received power to guide and advise female Huroola elders. No warring, no alliance, and no discussion were done without tribal speakers. Each village had, on average, between three and six speakers who communed with the ancestors. Both male and female 'speakers' were sources of ancestral lore and stories. Nightly, stories were retold to the new generation of villagers, with new stories added after each heroic deed committed by the tribe's women.

==Trade==
Men of the Huroola villages were taught to craft tools, baskets, and pots. None bore particular decorative value and were simple in design. Women hunted [[boar]]s, [[giant snake]]s, and most other mammals and reptiles that inhabited the Malatran Plateau. Male trappers brought home small game and [[fish]] At one time, women joined male fishers with their spears, but that practice was abandoned to not tempt men with the bloody power of weapons.

==History==
Around 300 years before the 14{{th}} century DR, the Huroola were a patriarchal society. Men were exclusively warriors, and physical strength was the only thing worth respect. Women of the tribe were speakers of the dead and shamans. Under the leadership of men, Huroola lived from war to war. They conquered a third of the Malatran Plateau, from the [[River of Laughing Idols]] to the savanna.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Come the Tiger|7}}

This blood-soaked culture led the Huroola people to the brink of extinction as a result of internal conflicts and acts of deadly revenge. But the women of the tribes—the speakers of the dead—were granted a vision by the tribe's ancestors. They guided the women to claim rulership from the men who were deemed untrustworthy by their ancestors. This revolution took place virtually overnight, owing to the convincing visions and Huroola's dire need for salvation. Following the switch, men were delegated to shamanistic duties while women took on the roles of leadership and power.

At some point before the late 14{{th}} century DR, Huroola warriors warred with the Living Jungle's overwhelming population of [[tasloi]]. Huroola exterminated the majority of tasloi, living many to think they became extinct, however, that was not true and the lizard humanoids simply went into hiding in their greatly reduced numbers.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Shadows of Sin|6}}

In the Year of Great Change, in the late 14{{th}} century DR, the extraplanar evil known as the [[Tamara (Malatra)|Tamara]] was looming over the Living Jungle. In order to reveal the invasion and the dreaded Tiger, the heroes of Malatra sought an alliance with the isolationist Huroola tribes. The heroes were tasked with rescuing two dozen Huroola hunters captured by the [[Kretch]], servants of the Tamara who infested the jungles. When the mission was successful, Huroola provided eighty of the strongest women of the tribe to the united army of the Living Jungle with only one demand: they only obeyed the orders of female commanders. This was not a problem as the general who ended up leading the battle was the [[Snake Mother]] of the [[yuan-ti]].

One year after the battle at the [[Blood Bridge]], in the Year of Tigers Curse, a member of the Huroola tribe almost brought ruin and destruction to the jungle. [[Nathani]] was a Huroola hunter who thought that the tribe's ancestors were angered by Huroola fighting side to side with males in the battle of the Blood Bridge, and she blamed all misfortunes on that fact. By luck, she came across [[Talunuku]], an ambitious [[spider katanga]] who sought to become the new [[Mother of a Thousand Young]], and the two decided to join forces. Nathani believed that with the demise of the Mother of a Thousand Young, it would take Talunuku some time to gather forces of the katanga under her rule, hence taking away allies from the Tamara's inevitable second invasion. However, Nathani's plans were thwarted by the heroes of the Living Jungle.{{Cite organized play/LJ/An Army of One Thousand|3}}
