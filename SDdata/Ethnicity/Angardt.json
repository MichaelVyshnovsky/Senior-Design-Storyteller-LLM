        "mainbody": "The '''Angardt''' were a [[barbarian]] [[human]] people descended from the [[Rengarth]] who lived in the land of [[Netheril]], far south of the Rengarth homelands in the harsh regions below the [[Netherese]] cities.",
        "Culture": "Having given up their superstitious fear of [[magic]] of their Rengarth relatives, the Angardt tribes were more experienced in non-shamanistic magic.",
        "History": "Formerly dwelling around [[Frostypaw]], the Angardt started out as members of the Rengarth tribe who began using [[arcane magic]] in {{YearlinkConvert|2477|NY}}, a practice forbidden by the Rengarth outside of shamanistic and clerical uses. For this schism, these Rengarth were banished, and any who did not leave at that instant were ritually massacred, numbering in the thousands. This caused a rift between them, and they began to attack one another on sight from around {{YearlinkConvert|2500|NY}}. The surviving Angardt tribe relocated far to the south of Rengarth territory."
