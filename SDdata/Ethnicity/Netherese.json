        "mainbody": "The '''Netherese''', also known as the '''Neth''', were an ethnic group of dark-haired, fair-skinned [[human]]s that resided in the ancient magocratic nation of [[Netheril]]. Many cultures and ethnic groups in [[Faerûn]] were either descendants or absorbed into the Netherese people, such as the [[Shadovar]], the [[Halruaan (ethnicity)|Halruaans]], the [[Bedine]], and the [[Illuskan]]s, among others. Only a few select groups of pure-blood Netherese still existed on [[Toril]] as of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], over a thousand years after the fall of the great Empire of Magic.\n\nThe Netherese had always lived in a hierarchical magocracy that was separated into the flying enclaves of High Netheril and the cities of Low Netheril located around the [[Narrow Sea]]. While the people shared a common script of [[draconic alphabet]], the people of Low Netheril spoke [[Netherese language|Netherese]] while the nobles of High Netheril spoke [[Loross]]. The reason for two languages was due to separation of the classes.",

            "Pureblood Netherese": "As of the 14{{th}} century, only four groups of pureblood Netherese humans were known to exist on Faerûn. \n\n* [[Marsh Drover]]s of the [[Farsea Marshes]] in Cormyr were believed to be descended from the people of Anauria who never integrated with the Chondathan population. \n* The [[Tunlar|barbarian]]s of the [[Tunlands]] were descendants of the [[Rengarth]] tribe, cousins of the commoners of Low Netheril.\n* There was a tribe of nomadic barbarians in [[the Ride]], north of the Moonsea, whose distant ancestry could be traced back to Low Netheril.\n* The Netherese of Thultanthar survived for over a thousand years in the plane of Shadow, and came to be known as the Shadovar."
