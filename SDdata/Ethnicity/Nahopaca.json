        "mainbody": "he Nahopaca were a group of humans who lived in the Pasocada Basin in Maztica. They were one of the seven major tribes of Mazticans.\nThe Nahopaca lived on the plateaus and mesas in the southern parts of the Pasocada Basin. It was an arid brush desert, but not as harsh as the deserts south of the basin.\nThe Nahopaca were primarily hunter-gatherers, using bows and arrows to take down prey and foe alike. They were nomadic, always seeking the most plentiful source of food and the most hospitable climate at any given time. They were not above raiding Azuposi settlements if given the opportunity. The Nahopaca also spoke their own language.\nThe Nahopaca were distantly related to the Dog People."
