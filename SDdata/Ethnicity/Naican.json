        "Society": "The Naican spoke [[Naican language|their own language]], which was influenced by the [[Raumathar|Raumatharan Empire]] and the language of [[Muhjuri]].\n\nThe Naican were friendly with the Commani, [[Zamogedi]], and Tuigan tribes, and opposed to the [[Oigur]] and the Dalat. The Naican sometimes raided with the Commani to the south in [[Semphar]].",
        "History": "Before the rise of the Tuigan to dominance, there were many marriages between the the Naican and the Zamogedi, solidifying the friendship between these two people groups.\n\nFor many ages, the Dalat had raided Naican territory, and the conflicts only grew worse over the years, resulting in blood feuds and nearly open warfare. This feud with the Dalat led to a feud with the Oigur, as that tribe would sometimes join with the Dalat in the raids.\n\nAt one point in history, the Naican shared the same pasture lands as the Tuigan. He gave them great power as a tribe for his thanks."
