The '''Netherese''', also known as the '''Neth''', were an ethnic group of dark-haired, fair-skinned [[human]]s that resided in the ancient magocratic nation of [[Netheril]]. Many cultures and ethnic groups in [[Faerûn]] were either descendants or absorbed into the Netherese people, such as the [[Shadovar]], the [[Halruaan (ethnicity)|Halruaans]], the [[Bedine]], and the [[Illuskan]]s, among others. Only a few select groups of pure-blood Netherese still existed on [[Toril]] as of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], over a thousand years after the fall of the great Empire of Magic.

The Netherese had always lived in a hierarchical magocracy that was separated into the flying enclaves of High Netheril and the cities of Low Netheril located around the [[Narrow Sea]]. While the people shared a common script of [[draconic alphabet]], the people of Low Netheril spoke [[Netherese language|Netherese]] while the nobles of High Netheril spoke [[Loross]]. The reason for two languages was due to separation of the classes.

==History==
Following the [[Karsus's Folly|fall of the High Netheril]] in the 4{{th}} century before [[Dale Reckoning]], the survivors of three cities of High Netheril, [[Anauria]], [[Asram]], and [[Hlondath]], along with the commoners of Low Netheril spread out from [[North Faerûn|northern Faerûn]] across the rest of the realms. The enclave of [[Thultanthar]] managed to survive the cataclysmic destruction by magically shifting into the [[Shadowfell]].

;High Netherese:
As the "Netherese survivor states" continually fell to external forces, Anauria in [[111 DR]] and Hlondath in [[329 DR]], the last-living people of High Netheril migrated south into what would be [[Cormyr]] and east into the [[Moonsea]] region. They were absorbed into the burgeoning [[Chondathan]] and [[Vaasan]] ethnic groups of humans. 

;Low Netherese:
The people of Low Netheril, referred to as the ''free folk'', mostly endured [[Karsus's Folly]] but had their essence and life force drained by the [[Phaerimm]]. Sometime around the mid-5{{th}} century [[DR]] they began migrating westward, fracturing into two groups in the process. One group moved northwest to the [[Savage Frontier]] and merged with the [[Illuskan]] people, while the others went southwest into the [[Western Heartlands]] where coalesced with the native [[Tethyrian]] tribes. 

===Pureblood Netherese===
As of the 14{{th}} century, only four groups of pureblood Netherese humans were known to exist on Faerûn. 

* [[Marsh Drover]]s of the [[Farsea Marshes]] in Cormyr were believed to be descended from the people of Anauria who never integrated with the Chondathan population. 
* The [[Tunlar|barbarian]]s of the [[Tunlands]] were descendants of the [[Rengarth]] tribe, cousins of the commoners of Low Netheril.
* There was a tribe of nomadic barbarians in [[the Ride]], north of the Moonsea, whose distant ancestry could be traced back to Low Netheril.
* The Netherese of Thultanthar survived for over a thousand years in the plane of Shadow, and came to be known as the Shadovar.
