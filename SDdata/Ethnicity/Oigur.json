        "mainbody": "The Oigur were a tribe of nomadic humans living in the Hordelands. They were among the tribes mistakenly called \"Tuigan\" by outsiders following the Horde Wars.\nThe Oigur lived in the southern wastes of the Hordelands. Their territory bordered the lands of the Tuigan, Quirish, and Kashghun tribes.\nThey spoke their own language.\nThey were considered rivals of the Naican but were allied with the Gur.\nFor many ages, the Dalat had raided Naican territory, and the Oigur would sometimes join them in this, leading to the feud between the Naican and Oigur.\nWhen Yamun Khahan came to power and formed his Grand Army of the Tuigan, the Oigur were the second tribe to fall to his conquest. The Oigur became friends with the Gurs, so as not to anger Yamun Khahan.\n* Kaunchi, a guide."
