The '''Koshiva''', or '''Boat People''', were a [[human]] [[Nubari]] tribe that held territory along the [[River of Laughing Idols]], beginning on the southeastern edge of the [[Fire Mountain]] and ending on the borders of the [[Rudra]] territory, on the [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite polyhedron/102/Tribes of the Nubari|10}}

==Habitat==
Despite their name, the Boat People did not live on water like the raft-dwelling [[Zantira]]. The Koshiva constructed spectacular tree villages. Homes were attached to tree trunks and connected to each other via woven bridges and large open platforms, all suspended high above the ground. Occasionally such villages even stretched across the River of Laughing Idols.

==Culture==
The Koshiva tribe consisted of relatively peaceful hunters and fishers. They trained no warriors, but the tribe's hunters, both men and women, were skilled hunters and provided good defense in times of crisis or against an occasional [[korobokuru]], [[lizardfolk]], or [[caiman katanga]] raid.

Most members of the tribe were trained fishers and boat makers who knew how to handle ropes and were proficient at weaving. The Koshiva people were hard-working and clever Nubari, making them masters of arts and crafts.

===Garb===
The most distinct feature of the Koshiva women was their unique and complex headwear, which was designed to rise high up and support their coifs of hair. The height of these elaborate decorations was an indicator of the woman's social standing within the tribe. "She wears her hair too high" was a common Koshiva saying, indicating the target's arrogance and vanity. Those women who raised their hair up without earning the status were forcefully sheared by her fellow Koshiva women.

The men of the tribe shaved their heads, in contrast to the women. Their hair was cropped short with simple ornamental designs shaved into their scalps. Traditionally, women were not allowed to shave men's heads as it was believed to be bad luck, and this privilege was granted only to a man's closest male friends.

==Trade==
The Koshiva's lands were along the banks of the River of Laughing Idols and, as such, the tribe's main industry was fishing. The river provided people with food, while additional food was foraged from the land by aging men and women of the tribe. On-land hunting parties were not common, but for special occasions, they brought back jungle beasts like wild [[boar]]s.

Talented craftspeople, the Koshiva created the best pottery, carvings, and jewelry among all Nubari tribes.{{Cite organized play/LJ/It Came from the Sky|9}}{{Cite organized play/LJ/The Courage of a Coward|5,14}}

The Koshiva maintained friendly relationships with other Nubari tribes, [[shu]] villages, and [[korobokuru]] communities. The tribe's relationship with [[river tam'hi]] remained strained and occasionally deteriorated over perceived disrespect of the tam'hi traditions or harm to the river.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Sharp Teeth, Mostly Tasty|6}}

==History==
in the Year of New Peoples, in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the chief of one of the Koshiva tribes, [[Rakil]], was taken hostage, along with his wife and daughter. The culprits were [[wildspace]]-faring [[oscray]], led by [[Backbiter (oscray)|Backbiter]]. The tribes of the Living Jungle became involved in a space war between oscray factions. Eventually, the heroes of [[Malatra]] defeated Backbiter, but the warlord's opponents, peaceful oscray, ended up stranded in the Living Jungle.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Ship from the Sky|2}}
