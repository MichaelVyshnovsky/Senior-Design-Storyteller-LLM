        "mainbody": "The Nexalans (or Nexala) were the largest ethnic group of humans living in Maztica. They were one of the seven major tribes of Mazticans. When most folk in Faer√ªn used the term \"Maztican\", they were most likely referring to Nexalans, as Nexalans were the only people of Maztica who had traveled to the east as of 1372 DR.\nNexalans were taller than the Payits. They had lean bodies and angular features. The men never had beards.\nNexalans, as a rule, were strong and intelligent, but they often lacked wisdom in their decisions.\nThe Nexalan people lived in the nations of Pezelac and Kultaka, and the city-states of Huacli and the Valley of Nexal (the most famous of which was the city of Nexal). In addition, the people of Kolan possessed some Nexalan traits, although they were primarily an offshoot of the Green Folk.\nNexalan culture was largely warlike, and the Nexalans were the first people in Maztica to practice human sacrifice. They worshiped the Maztican pantheon, especially Zaltec. However, the gods Tezca and Azul (who they called Calor) were also honored greatly.\nNexalan culture placed a strong emphasis on aesthetics and did not care as much about substance. A prime example was the Great Pyramid of Nexal with its grandiose mosaics and gaudy colors.\nThe people in the Valley of Nexal the Nexalan language, with a distinct dialect of that language spoken by the people of Pezelac. The people of Huacli spoke their own, related, language, with a separate dialect for each of the six city-states. The Kulatakans also had their own language, though it too was related to Nexalan."
