        "mainbody": "ukalatu, was a cannibalistic, later reformed, human Nubari tribe that inhabited the southeastern shore of the Hebika River of the jungle-covered Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur.\nKukalaturi were culturally a cannibalistic tribe of the Malatran Nubari folk. Ethnically, Kukalatu were descendants of the Shou and a bygone spelljamming race known as  the Ancients. Unlike many other tribes of the Malatran Plateau, Kukalatu shared most of their features with their Shou ancestors, rarely producing offspring with pointed ears or three fingers of the Ancients. Over countless centuries, Kukalaturi adopted a custom of filing their front teeth into pointed fangs. After the Reformation, the custom remained however, it was not used for cannibalism and instead served as a reminder of the tribes fatuous past.\nThe tribe inhabited the land north of the Fire Mountain, along its hilly slopes at the volcanos base, on the southeastern shore of the Hebika River that ran further north until it formed the Dokuba Swamp.\nReportedly, after Reformation, the Kukalatu tribe became known for its friendliness, hospitality, and somewhat dark sense of humor regarding their cannibalistic past. They were talented healers and superb cooks – skills passed along through generations. stews and grills of palm hearts and tenala roots among others.\nPost-Reformation, traveling was very common among the members of the tribe. Kukalatu sought the knowledge of the jungles and often joined groups from other Malatran tribes, offering their skills in healing. However, they were rarely asked to prepare meals.\nDespite having a curious mind, Kukalatu main interest was always food. The tribes hunters and warriors always assessed their foes with two criteria in mind how strong and how tasty it was – remnants of their \"eat or be eaten\" past worldview. However, this did not mean Kukalatu remained a bloodthirsty culture, but their appreciation of food was somewhat simple and unique among other tribes.\nPerhaps the most important custom of the tribe was the Kill Ritual. When a powerful creature was slain in battle, its blood was gathered into a cup by a shaman, a priest, or the eldest warrior. The blood was used for several thumb-painted marks on Kukalatu tribespeople. Those who killed the foe received a single stripe per kill over their left eyebrow. Those who participated in the battle but did not land a killing strike received a single stripe across their brow. These markings were a mark of respect. If an outsider landed the killing strike, they were offered a simple blessing.\nThe Kukalatu language had a plethora of root words that described the taste and toughness-related concepts. The tribes name was an accidental creation many centuries before the 14 century DR. Two Kukalatu hunters were locked in a loud argument, one saying \"kuka\" – the word for \"sharp teeth\" meaning toughness of the pay, while the other hunter said \"latu\" – \"mostly tasty.\" The argument became an endless chant of \"kuka-latu.\" The hunters prey overheard the argument and escaped to tell the tale of the dangerous \"Kukalatu.\" \nIn the ancient past, the Kukalatu language was a complex tongue that devolved over the centuries. It effectively became a collection of hard root words and simple phrases. The end product of the language de-evolution was simplistic Malatran Common, smattered with the Kukalatu language words and phrseses.\nThe tribe, like all other inhabitants of the Living Jungle, did not worship any deities. They respected spirits of the land, honored the sun – Lizu Sapa, the bright fire sky father, and earth – Zima, the earth mother – the jungle. However, the tribes religion was ancestral worship. Kukalatu believed that the future was shaped by and through the knowledge and wisdom of their ancestors. When clerics and shamans of the tribe prayed for wisdom, guidance, or miracles – they prayed to the ancestors. The tribe crafted spell fetishes using the bones, teeth, and hair of their respected dead family members. The older and wiser the dead ancestor was, the more powerful magics were contained within fetishes crafted using their bodies. Kukalatu kept such fetishes in small leather pushes. Warriors and rogues of the tribe usually kept braided hair fetishes. Wizards used finger bones and priests – teeth.\nThe Elder Priests were some of the most respected members of the tribe. They used generational skills and wisdom and were considered the most skilled medicine men and women of the Malatran Plateau. They knew countless medicinal recipes, knew curatives for wounds, diseases, and poisons. The Elder Priests services always came at a price. The Elder Priests were old, old enough to have lived in the Pre-Reformation society, and they demanded a traditional payment for the services – major healing rituals required a payment of a single pinkie finger joint off a patients hand. This payment was considered to be a great honor among Kukalatu. Those who were missing several joins called it \"becoming closer to the Ancients.\"\nKukalaturi was a democratic society and engaged in sometimes overlong discussions before acting. The main governing body was the Council of Almost Ancestors (or Council of Almost Ancients). The oldest and wisest members of the tribe became members of the council with the most senior member – the Eldest One. Every single discussion was discussed ad nauseum before being put to the tripes vote. Only the most important issues were voted upon as the tribe let more trivial matters be resolved between involved parties. If the vote was not satisfactory, members of the tribe made their thoughts known, but the majority rule was always respected.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the Eldest One of Kukalatu was eVunuyu Vubiki, a woman over one hundred and twenty years old. She was the wisest and the most powerful cleric of the tribe.\nKukalatu had a bloody history with other Nubari tribes. Post-Reformation, the tribe remained secluded but not completely isolated from the rest of the Plateau due to their past. Kukalatu received very few visitors and engaged in virtually no trade until the Year of Tigers Return, Malatran calendar, when the tribe added a group of heroes and opened trade relations with the tribes.\nThe most important event in the tribes history was the Reformation that took place over seventy years before the Year of Tigers Return, Malatran calendar (late 14 century DR). There existed two stories that were often told of the event. Which one of them was truthful was never revealed to the outsiders. One story talked about a great drought that caused animals and people of Malatra to gather around the greatly shrunken bodies of water. At first, hunting was abundant, but with time, fewer humans were caught, and Kukalatu started feuding between themselves. A great shaman of the time communed with the tribes ancestors, who shared their profound wisdom abandon cannibalism of the tribe would be no more. The shaman stated the message with the rest of the tribe only to create an unresolvable schism among Kukalatu. Those who refused to abandon cannibalism left the village and moved to the Dokuba Swamp and became known as Kukaputuri Nubu. Those who refused to consume outsiders and old members of their own spayed and changed their ways forever, aided by their ancestors.\nThe second story was considered a childrens tale. It talked about hunters leaving to catch prey in preparation for the Feast of Big Bellies – the hunters task was finding the plumpest and big-bellied humans to be cooked in celebration. The hunters discovered a tribe filled with large well-fed people but could not agree if the villa was \"more strong\" or \"more tasty.\" In the end, the hunters were all killed, and the Kukalatu tribe, lacking strong hunters, decided to abandon cannibalism to survive. It was easier to be friends with neighbors rather than hunting and eating them.\nBy the late 14 century DR, the Unreformed, or Kukaputuri Nubu, were considered evil and ostracized by the rest of the Kukalatu. Kukaputuri Nubu were riled by Alisuba Bika, \"Dark Heart, Big Teeth,\" who allied her tribe with the lizardfolk of the Dokuba Swamp.\nIn the Year of Tigers Return, a band of heroes was sent to the Kukalatu village from the Koshiva tribe in search of the Nu-le Mi-se healing salve for the blinded wife of the tribes chieftain. After traversing the dangers of the jungle, the heroes were greeted by Kukalatu hunters and two saru twins adopted by the tribe. They were granted an audience with the Eldest One, who agreed to help but needed sweet waters and unique blind cave fish of Nu-le Mi-se from within the Moaning Cave. The adventurers braved the dangerous caves and returned with a 200 pounds (91 kilograms) gourd filled with fish and cave water. The Eldest One prepared the curative poultice, cooked a feast of the blind cave fish for her tribe, and happily opened trade relations with previously hostile Malatran tribes.\n*Apimu, an extremely skilled and extremely neurotic garudaskin crafter in the late 14 century DR.\n*Bifu, meaning \"Big Foot\", was a tough and valorous hunter in the late 14 century DR.\n*Gihu, or \"Agile Hands\", a mischievous rogue in the late 14 century DR.\n*eJahi, or \"Open Welcome\", a warrior of the tribe who liked attention and appreciated revelry, active in the late 14 century DR.\n*eNuka Ximi, an old and toothless village traded and cook who could rant about not having human meat endlessly in the late 14 century DR.\n*eVuku Piki, or \"SheVery Smart,Peaceful Wisdom\", a wise elder of the Council of Almost Ancestors in the late 14 century DR.\n*Nuaki Latu, a jovial hunter of the tribe in the late 14 century DR.\n*Nuta Vimu, or \"Not Fast, Fat Belly\", a member of the Council of Almost Ancestors in the late 14 century DR.\n*Wisu Jiju, \"Wind Sound, Strong Spell\", a powerful wizard of the tribe and one of the councilmen in the late 14 century DR."
