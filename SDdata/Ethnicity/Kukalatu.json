        "mainbody": "'''Kukalatu''', was a cannibalistic, later reformed, [[human]] [[Nubari]] tribe that inhabited the southeastern shore of the [[Hebika River]] of the jungle-covered [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Sharp Teeth, Mostly Tasty‎‎|14-16}}\n\n{{quote|''The bigger they are, the harder they fall - but, that just tenderizes the meat.''|Kukalaturi proverb}}",
        "Description": "Kukalaturi were culturally a cannibalistic tribe of the Malatran Nubari folk. Ethnically, Kukalatu were descendants of the [[Shou]] and a bygone ''[[spelljamming]]'' race known as ''[[Nubari (ancient)| the Ancients]]''. Unlike many other tribes of the Malatran Plateau, Kukalatu shared most of their features with their Shou ancestors, rarely producing offspring with pointed ears or three fingers of the Ancients. Over countless centuries, Kukalaturi adopted a custom of filing their front teeth into pointed fangs. After the [[Reformation]], the custom remained; however, it was not used for cannibalism and instead served as a reminder of the tribe's fatuous past.",
        "Habitat": "The tribe inhabited the land north of the [[Fire Mountain]], along its hilly slopes at the volcano's base, on the southeastern shore of the Hebika River that ran further north until it formed the [[Dokuba Swamp]].",
        "Culture": {
            "Customs": "{{quote|''Don't mourn your dead - eat them.''|Kukalaturi proverb}}<br/>\nDespite having a curious mind, Kukalatu main interest was always food. The tribe's hunters and warriors always assessed their foes with two criteria in mind: how strong and how tasty it was – remnants of their \"eat or be eaten\" past worldview. However, this did not mean Kukalatu remained a bloodthirsty culture, but their appreciation of food was somewhat simple and unique among other tribes.\n\nPerhaps the most important custom of the tribe was the [[Kill Ritual]]. When a powerful creature was slain in battle, its blood was gathered into a cup by a shaman, a priest, or the eldest warrior. The blood was used for several thumb-painted marks on Kukalatu tribespeople. Those who killed the foe received a single stripe per kill over their left eyebrow. Those who participated in the battle but did not land a killing strike received a single stripe across their brow. These markings were a mark of respect. If an outsider landed the killing strike, they were offered a simple blessing.",
            "Language": "The [[Kukalatu language]] had a plethora of root words that described the taste and toughness-related concepts. The tribe's name was an accidental creation many centuries before the 14{{th}} century DR. Two Kukalatu hunters were locked in a loud argument, one saying \"kuka\" – the word for \"sharp teeth\" meaning toughness of the pay, while the other hunter said \"latu\" – \"mostly tasty.\" The argument became an endless chant of \"kuka-latu.\" The hunters' prey overheard the argument and escaped to tell the tale of the dangerous \"Kukalatu.\" \n\nIn the ancient past, the Kukalatu language was a complex tongue that devolved over the centuries. It effectively became a collection of hard root words and simple phrases. The end product of the language de-evolution was simplistic [[Malatran Common]], smattered with the Kukalatu language words and phrseses."

        "Religion": "The tribe, like all other inhabitants of the Living Jungle, did not worship any deities. They respected spirits of the land, honored the sun – [[Lizu Sapa]], the bright fire sky father, and earth – [[Zima]], the earth mother – the jungle.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Sharp Teeth, Mostly Tasty‎‎|6}} However, the tribe's religion was ancestral worship. Kukalatu believed that the future was shaped by and through the knowledge and wisdom of their ancestors. When clerics and shamans of the tribe prayed for wisdom, guidance, or miracles – they prayed to the ancestors. The tribe crafted ''[[spell fetish]]es'' using the bones, teeth, and hair of their respected dead family members. The older and wiser the dead ancestor was, the more powerful magics were contained within fetishes crafted using their bodies. Kukalatu kept such fetishes in small [[leather]] pushes. Warriors and rogues of the tribe usually kept braided hair fetishes. Wizards used finger bones and priests – teeth.\n\nThe Elder Priests were some of the most respected members of the tribe. They used generational skills and wisdom and were considered the most skilled medicine men and women of the Malatran Plateau. They knew countless medicinal recipes, knew curatives for wounds, diseases, and poisons. The Elder Priests' services always came at a price. The Elder Priests were old, old enough to have lived in the Pre-Reformation society, and they demanded a traditional payment for the services – major healing rituals required a payment of a single pinkie finger joint off a patient's hand. This payment was considered to be a great honor among Kukalatu. Those who were missing several joins called it \"becoming closer to the Ancients.\"",
        "Government": "Kukalaturi was a democratic society and engaged in sometimes overlong discussions before acting. The main governing body was the [[Council of Almost Ancestors]] (or Council of Almost Ancients).{{Cite organized play/LJ/Sharp Teeth, Mostly Tasty‎‎|2}} The oldest and wisest members of the tribe became members of the council with the most senior member – the [[Eldest One]]. Every single discussion was discussed ad nauseum before being put to the tripe's vote. Only the most important issues were voted upon as the tribe let more trivial matters be resolved between involved parties. If the vote was not satisfactory, members of the tribe made their thoughts known, but the majority rule was always respected.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Eldest One of Kukalatu was [[eVunuyu Vubiki]], a woman over one hundred and twenty years old. She was the wisest and the most powerful cleric of the tribe.",
        "Trade": "Kukalatu had a bloody history with other Nubari tribes. Post-Reformation, the tribe remained secluded but not completely isolated from the rest of the Plateau due to their past. Kukalatu received very few visitors and engaged in virtually no trade until the Year of Tigers Return, Malatran calendar, when the tribe added a group of heroes and opened trade relations with the tribes.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Sharp Teeth, Mostly Tasty‎‎|12}}",
        "History": "{{quote|''If you wait to see the whites of their eyes, you might as well take a good look at the teeth, throat, and stomach on the way down.''|Kukalaturi proverb}}<br/>\n\nThe most important event in the tribe's history was the Reformation that took place over seventy years before the Year of Tigers Return, Malatran calendar (late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]). There existed two stories that were often told of the event. Which one of them was truthful was never revealed to the outsiders. One story talked about a great drought that caused animals and people of Malatra to gather around the greatly shrunken bodies of water. At first, hunting was abundant, but with time, fewer humans were caught, and Kukalatu started feuding between themselves. A great shaman of the time communed with the tribe's ancestors, who shared their profound wisdom: abandon cannibalism of the tribe would be no more. The shaman stated the message with the rest of the tribe only to create an unresolvable schism among Kukalatu. Those who refused to abandon cannibalism left the village and moved to the Dokuba Swamp and became known as [[Kukaputuri Nubu]]. Those who refused to consume outsiders and old members of their own spayed and changed their ways forever, aided by their ancestors.\n\nThe second story was considered a children's tale. It talked about hunters leaving to catch prey in preparation for the [[Feast of Big Bellies]] – the hunters' task was finding the plumpest and big-bellied humans to be cooked in celebration. The hunters discovered a tribe filled with large well-fed people but could not agree if the villa was \"more strong\" or \"more tasty.\" In the end, the hunters were all killed, and the Kukalatu tribe, lacking strong hunters, decided to abandon cannibalism to survive. It was easier to be friends with neighbors rather than hunting and eating them.\n\nBy the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Unreformed, or Kukaputuri Nubu, were considered evil and ostracized by the rest of the Kukalatu. Kukaputuri Nubu were riled by [[Alisuba Bika]], \"Dark Heart, Big Teeth,\" who allied her tribe with the [[lizardfolk]] of the Dokuba Swamp.\n\nIn the Year of Tigers Return, a band of heroes was sent to the Kukalatu village from the [[Koshiva]] tribe in search of the ''[[Nu-le Mi-se healing salve]]'' for the blinded wife of the tribe's chieftain. After traversing the dangers of the jungle, the heroes were greeted by Kukalatu hunters and two [[saru]] twins adopted by the tribe. They were granted an audience with the Eldest One, who agreed to help but needed sweet waters and unique blind [[cave fish]] of [[Nu-le Mi-se]] from within the [[Moaning Cave]]. The adventurers braved the dangerous caves and returned with a 200 pounds (91 kilograms) [[gourd]] filled with fish and cave water. The Eldest One prepared the curative poultice, cooked a feast of the blind cave fish for her tribe, and happily opened trade relations with previously hostile Malatran tribes.",
