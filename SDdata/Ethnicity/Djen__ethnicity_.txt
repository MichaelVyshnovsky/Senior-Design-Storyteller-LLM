The '''Djen''' were one of the two major subethnicities of the [[Calishite]]s. They formed the ruling class of [[Calimshan]].

==Description==
Djen humans were shorter and duskier-skinned than most other people groups, including other Calishites, with dark brown hair and eyes as well. Occasionally, a Djen with red or lighter hair or blue or green eyes would be born; this child was always considered a sign of the favor of the gods.

When a Djen produced children with other races or ethnic groups, Djen features tended to dominate in the offspring.

==History==
The Djen were descendants of the human slaves brought by [[Calim]] which included not only the human slaves but also the whole group of [[genie]]s and their servants of other races. After the fall of Calim, the Djen became the nobles and rulers of Calimshan. Unlike the [[Tethan]]s, this grouping of people tended to intermarry less frequently and were thus considered more "pure". About 30% of humans in Calimshan were members of this racial group.
