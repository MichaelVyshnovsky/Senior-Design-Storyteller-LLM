Katashaka
The Thinguth of the land of Thindol were a tribe originally from Katashaka, the continent from which the Chultan tribes first emigrated.
The Thinguth were known around Faer√ªn as being particularly fast runners. Like their Chultan cousins, the Thinguth were tall and had dark, ebony skin.
Along with the Tabaxi, Eshowe, and other tribes, the Thinguth followed the teachings of Ubtao and left their homes on Katashaka to immigrate to Chult in . Upon arriving on the new continent, they settled the Sanrach and Thindol Basins.
Millennia later, in , the Thinguth were enslaved by the yuan-ti tribes of the Sseradess and the Sauringar. This caused a dispersion of their people over the lands that would later by Samarach and Thindol. It took hundreds of years before the Thinguth were freed by Shoon soldiers from their yuan-ti and lizardfolk masters in 293 DR. The Shoon then established rule over Thindol, Tashalar, and Lapaliiya.
