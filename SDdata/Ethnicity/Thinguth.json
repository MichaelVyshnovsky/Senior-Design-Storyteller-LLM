Upon arriving on the new continent, they settled the [[Sanrach Basin|Sanrach]] and [[Thindol Basin]]s.\n\nMillennia later, in {{Yearlink|-289}}, the Thinguth were enslaved by the [[yuan-ti]] tribes of the [[Sseradess]] and the [[Sauringar]]. This caused a dispersion of their people over the lands that would later by [[Samarach]] and Thindol. It took hundreds of years before the Thinguth were freed by [[Shoon Imperium|Shoon]] soldiers from their yuan-ti and [[lizardfolk]] masters in [[293 DR]]. The Shoon then established rule over Thindol, [[Tashalar]], and [[Lapaliiya]]."
