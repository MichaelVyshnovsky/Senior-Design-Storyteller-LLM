"'''Ice Hunters'''" or "'''Ancient Men of the North'''" were the names given to a sub-ethnicity of [[Ulutiun]]s who resided in the northwestern-most regions of [[Faer√ªn]].

==Regions==
The Ice Hunters lived in the [[Cold Run]], on the [[Ice Peak]], and on the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].

==Description==
Like their cousins from the [[Great Glacier]], The Ice Hunters were particularly clever and tended toward a lifestyle of [[lawful]]ness.

==Society==
The Ice Hunters lived barbaric lives compared to more southern peoples, not dissimilar to the [[Uthgardt]] tribes, but their lives were comparatively simple and peaceful. They occupied small villages and traveled by dog sled. They used boats called ''[[khyek]]s'' and ''[[oumyek]]s''. They supported themselves by fishing and the hunting of [[polar bear]], [[seal]], [[walrus]], and [[whale]].

Among the Ulutiuns of the Great Glacier, the Ice Hunters were most similar in culture to the [[Nakulutiun]]s.

In Ice Hunter culture, ones real name was kept private and personal. Instead, they gave outsiders nicknames to use, such as "Red Seal Man" or "Reindeer Girl".

===Religion===
The Ice Hunters worshiped various nature spirits (beast totems) and were led by [[Ice Hunter shaman|shamans]]. These spirits included:
* [[Grandfather Walrus]],
* [[Great White Bear]],
* [[Clever Oomio|Clever Oomio the Gray Seal]], and
* [[Pindalpau-pau]] the Reindeer Mother.

In addition, they venerated the god [[Ulutiu]]. Powerful priests of Ulutiu were known as [[iceguardian]]s

===Language===
Speakers of [[Uluik]],<ref name=D:SiT-p26>{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} the Ice Hunters began using the [[Thorass alphabet]] by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Scholars believed that the Ice Hunters immigrated to the far northwest from [[Kara-Tur]] over the polar icecap before the coming of either the [[Illuskan]]s or the [[Netherese]]. When the Illuskans arrived, many Ice Hunters were displaced from their native lands.

==Notable Ice Hunters==
* [[Bleak Sky at Morning]], shaman of the village of [[Icewolf]].
* [[Orcaheart]], village champion of the tribe that dwelled upon the island of [[Oyaviggaton]].
