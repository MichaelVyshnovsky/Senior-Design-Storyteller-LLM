The '''Mar''' were a race of [[human]]s dwelling in the [[Utter East]].

==History==
The Mar were the indigenous inhabitants of the Utter East; they had settled along the coastline in past ages. Their histories told they had known only oppression since that time.

In the [[621 DR|Year of Nineteen Swords, 621 DR]], [[Moonshaes]] [[Ffolk]] arrived on the shores of the Utter East, where they chose to settle.By "Ffolk" here, Mar historians may be referring to both Ffolk and Northmen. The Northman kingdom of Konigheim was established in the novels as being heavily involved in slaving.

The Ffolk discovered the [[bloodforge]]s in the [[648 DR|Year of the Dancing Daggers, 648 DR]] and burst into the [[Bloodforge Wars]]. The Mar could only be helpless witnesses, recording events for posterity. A decade of unending warfare devastated the Utter East, leaving the ancestral lands of the Mar despoiled. Finally, after the [[Plague of Fiends]] in the [[657 DR|Year of the Nine Stars, 657 DR]] and the subsequent [[Scouring of the Utter East]], the Five Kingdoms were in ruin and chaos, but the Mar had, at least, survived. They stood up and demanded their freedom, and the Ffolk, weary and sick of warfare, yielded it, however reluctantly. Nevertheless, they still had no land of their own, nor were they heard in the royal courts. This state of affairs continued for centuries.

==Language==
The indigenous Mar people spoke the [[Maran|Maran or Mari]] language, which was most closely related to the languages of Zakhara.{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26, 29}} It was melodious but rapidly spoken, with short syllables and throat clicks.

==Personality==
As the Mar told it, they were not a proud people, but they were patient. They saw their endurance under the yoke of oppression as their greatest virtue.
