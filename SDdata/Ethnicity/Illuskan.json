        "mainbody": "Illuskan was the name usually given to humans who lived in the Sword Coast North. They were also known as Northlanders. Illuskans made up the bulk of the population in the following areas\n* The Sword Coast North\n* The Trackless Sea\n* The Dessarin river valley\n* The Uthgardt tribes\nIlluskans were tall, fair-skinned people. Most had blue or steel gray eyes. Those living on the islands in the Trackless Sea and Icewind Dale had more blond hair, and slightly less red and brown. Those in the Sword Coast North and surrounding lands had more raven black hair, from their significant Netherese heritage.\nThe Northlanders originated in the island of Ruathym. The island was thought of as their ancestral home, from where they spread into other islands in the Sea of Swords and into the continent following the founding of the city of Luskan."
