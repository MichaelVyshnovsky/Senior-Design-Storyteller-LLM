Illuskans made up the bulk of the population in the following areas:\n\n* The Sword Coast North\n* The [[Trackless Sea]]\n* The [[Dessarin]] river valley\n* The [[Uthgardt]] tribes",
        "Physical description": "Illuskans were tall, fair-skinned people. Most had blue or steel gray eyes. Those living on the islands in the Trackless Sea and [[Icewind Dale]] had more blond hair, and slightly less red and brown. Those in the Sword Coast North and surrounding lands had more raven black hair, from their significant [[Netherese]] heritage.",
        "History": "The Northlanders originated in the island of [[Ruathym]]. The island was thought of as their ancestral home, from where they spread into other islands in the [[Sea of Swords]] and into the continent following the founding of the city of [[Luskan]]."
