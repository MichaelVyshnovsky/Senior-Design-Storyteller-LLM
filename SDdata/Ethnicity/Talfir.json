        "History": "The earliest historical mention of the Talfir was found in ancient elven writings dating from the [[Crown Wars]]. these tribes were first observed in Shantel Othreier and later became the first humans to settle along the [[Chionthar]].\n\nThe Talfir invented a style of [[bard]]ic magic known as [[shadow magic]], or \"Talfirian magic\" (not to be confused with [[Shadow Weave]] magic).\n\n''Circa'' [[140 DR]], refugees from the persecution of the Shadowking crossed the [[Sea of Swords]] and settled in the [[Moonshae Isles]] on the island of [[Gwynneth]], beginning the race of the Ffolk.\n\nThe Talfir of mainland [[Faerûn]] had completely disappeared by ''circa'' [[300 DR]], their culture being overwhelmed by the [[Calishite]], [[Chondathan]], and [[Netherese]] peoples.",
        "Legacy": "Few structures or artifacts from the time of the Talfir remained by [[1372 DR]]. Two notable exceptions were the crypt of the Shadowking, which was located beneath [[Iriaebor]], and [[Talis (city)|Talis]], a city in the middle of the [[Reaching Woods]] along the river. Prominent in the 1{{st}} century DR, it was in ruins by the 14{{th}} century.\n\nThe legacy of Talfirian magic continued in the bardic tradition of the Tethyrians.",
        "Notable Talfir": "* [[Verraketh]], the Shadowking of Ebenfar\n* [[Markus Randol]], the Archduke of Ebenfar\n* [[Gwynneth (person)|Gwynneth Randol]], the \"First Mother\" of the Moonshae Isles"
