        "mainbody": "The Talfir (or Talfirc) were an extinct race of humans who once dwelt in the lands that later became known as the Western Heartlands.\nThe Talfir were described by the elves who wrote about them as having fair skin and dark hair.\nThey originated in the great forest of Shantel Othreier\nThe Talfir spoke their own language of Talfiric, which derived from the Draconic language.\nReligious scholars suspected that the Talfir were responsible for introducing many of the gods of the Faerûnian pantheon to Toril, most notably the deity Tempus.\nThe earliest historical mention of the Talfir was found in ancient elven writings dating from the Crown Wars. these tribes were first observed in Shantel Othreier and later became the first humans to settle along the Chionthar.\nThe Talfir invented a style of bardic magic known as shadow magic, or \"Talfirian magic\" (not to be confused with Shadow Weave magic).\nCirca 140 DR, refugees from the persecution of the Shadowking crossed the Sea of Swords and settled in the Moonshae Isles on the island of Gwynneth, beginning the race of the Ffolk.\nThe Talfir of mainland Faerûn had completely disappeared by circa 300 DR, their culture being overwhelmed by the Calishite, Chondathan, and Netherese peoples.\nFew structures or artifacts from the time of the Talfir remained by 1372 DR. Two notable exceptions were the crypt of the Shadowking, which was located beneath Iriaebor, and Talis, a city in the middle of the Reaching Woods along the river. Prominent in the 1 century DR, it was in ruins by the 14 century.\nThe legacy of Talfirian magic continued in the bardic tradition of the Tethyrians.\n* Verraketh, the Shadowking of Ebenfar\n* Markus Randol, the Archduke of Ebenfar\n* Gwynneth Randol, the \"First Mother\" of the Moonshae Isles"
