The '''Koryoan''' people were an ethnicity of [[human]]s who lived in the land of [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. They were decendants of the ancient [[Han people]]. The Koryoans formed the kingdoms of [[Silla]], [[Koguryo]], and [[Saishu]], later provinces of the Empire of Koryo in the 14th century [[DR]]. They were sometimes nicknamed "Cold Koryoans".

==Language==
They spoke the [[Koryo language]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}} It descended from the ancient [[Han language]] and its vocabulary comprised many words evolved from that tongue, as well as loanwords from [[Wa-an language|Wa-an]] and [[Kao te Shou]] that had been borrowed over centuries. Owing to its similarities, it was easy to find Koryoan translators for many languages, though few learned [[Kozakuran language|Kozakuran]], owing to enmity between the peoples.

==Description==
The Koryoan people tended to have black hair and high cheekbones, and had moderate heights and builds; they most closely resembled the people of [[Chukei]] province in northern [[Shou Lung]].{{Cite dragon/315/Kara-Tur: Ancestor Feats and Martial Arts Styles|63}}

==Attitudes==
They were a proud folk, known to be fearless in a fight and exuberant in a celebration. However, the people were molded by a history of war and invasion and of living under threats of such. They were always alert, but tended toward xenophobia, preferring to trust a fellow Koryoan over a stranger. It wasn't unknown for one to wrongly blame a foreigner for some crime, rather than suspect or doubt one of their own people.

==Culture==
Koryoan folk of both genders commonly wore [[linen]] tunics and pants, all in white. These served as their daily work-wear. Silk was expensive and hard to come by, so only the wealthiest could afford it; rich women normally wore ornate satin dresses with silk veils. Warriors usually wore a heavy padded armor that kept them warm in winter.

Noble scions could be kept cloistered in family mansions, learning such things as calligraphy, courtly etiquette, languages, and poetry. Many were sent at a young age to military academies, where they learned the arts of war, armed and unarmed martial arts, history (especially military history), animal husbandry, geography and other knowledge of the kingdom, and meditation, as well as calligraphy and courtly etiquette. Koryoans of all classes and walks of life tended to learn history.

All Koryoan men trained in the "foot and fist" martial art of [[tae kwon do]], which had a number of different styles and forms. Archery was also commonly practiced and respected, and treated as a competitive art.{{Cite dragon/315/Kara-Tur: Ancestor Feats and Martial Arts Styles|64, 65}}

According to Shou Lung sources, Koryoan culture was only slightly influenced by [[Shou]] culture.

===Relations===
The Koryoans bore a great enmity for the [[Kozakuran people]], their culture, and even their language,<ref group="note">The wars between Koryo and Kozakura are not mentioned at all in the Kozakuran chapter of ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'', nor in any other source to deal with Kozakura, so the cause and nature of these conflicts are unknown.

The Koryoans also regularly beat back invasions by the wild tribes of the northern [[Koryo Peninsula]].

The Koryoans were on peaceful terms with neighboring [[Wa]], with [[Wanese]] traders and their currency seen in Koryoan ports.
