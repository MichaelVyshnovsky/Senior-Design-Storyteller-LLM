Lorendrow, or greenshadow elves, were a distinctive sort of jungle-dwelling drow who were incredibly elusive.
These almost completely unknown dark elves were wise, and were attuned to their environment.
Greenshadow elven society was harmonious, as they drew wisdom from the forest, earth and sky.
Lorendrow were one of the two dark elven groups to reject Lolth. Whilst almost all of them (Udadrow) followed the Spider Queens ways, and the Aevendrow headed north, the Lorendrow began a very long trip to the south.
By the late 15 century DR, they remained so well concealed by the dense jungle that not even the most well-travelled explorers knew of their existence. However, some of the aevendrow in the city of Callidae far to the north knew of their existence and their city.
