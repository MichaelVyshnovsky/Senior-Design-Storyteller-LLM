The Tethans were the largest of the two major subethnicities of the Calishites.
Tethans were taller, bulkier, and lighter-skinned than the noble ethnicity of "pure" Djen, but they were still darker than most other human ethnotypes.
The Tethans were the result of the Djen interbreeding with the original native races of the region of Shining Sea. They were named Tethans by the people of Mulhorand.
The Tethans comprised almost half of all residents of Calimshan, yet they were forbidden from rising in Calishite society beyond the status of merchants or tradesfolk, and 70% of Tethans in that land were either servants or slaves.
The Kahmir crime family was composed of those of Tethan racial stock mixed with Mulan blood.
