The '''Tsu-tsu''' (or "Tsu-Tsu"{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|48}} They were among the tribes mistakenly called "[[Tuigan]]" by outsiders following the [[Horde Wars]].

==Language==
As one of the major tribes of the Plain of Horses, the Tsu-tsu spoke their own dialect of [[Chuchian]], called "Tsu-tsu".<ref group="note">''The Horde'' lists "Fankiang" and "Khaghun" as languages in their own right, but the ''Kara-Tur'' sources discuss these as only dialects of the Chuchian language. ''The Horde'' does not list Tsu-tsu, but as a major tribe it must also have its own dialect.

==Territory==
Tsu-tsu territory stretched from the base of the [[Chigidi Mountains]] in the north, to the [[Shou Lung]] province of [[Chukei]] in the east, and to the [[Kashghun]] territory in the west. Its southern tip met the northern end of the [[Dragonwall]].

==Society==
The Tsu-tsu tribe were semi-nomadic, spending most of their year on the steppes, where they herded sheep and cattle, before returning to their villages or the city of [[Jugicha]]. Thus, each Tsu-tsu family had two homes: tents in the summer and brick houses in the winter.

They were considered to be among the top hunters and fishermen of the Plain of Horses, as well as superb herders and producers of livestock. They were proficient in breeding [[horse]]s, and were the only tribe in the area to breed [[pig]]s.

In Jugicha, the Tsu-tsu maintained a number of temples staffed by [[Wikipedia:Lama|lama]]s,

==History==
The Tsu-tsu tribe were founded when a band of rebels split from the Fankiang city of [[Li-Raz]] around {{YearlinkConvert|2100|SY}}. They desired to settle their own community, which developed into Jugicha. This triggered a realignment of the ''hsing'' (clans) of the Plain of Horses, ultimately giving rise to the Tsu-tsu.

Later, the Tsu-tsu sought to conquer the Fankiang in Li-Raz. To this end, around {{YearlinkConvert|2500|SY}}, they made a treaty with the Kashghun and allied against the Fankiang, proposing they assault them from opposite sides. Although the Tsu-tsu attacked the Fankiang from the north, the Kashghun changed their mind. The Tsu-tsu were forced to withdraw.

''Circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2587|SY}}, the ''qaghan'' (ruler) of the Tsu-tsu was [[Shajji Ghoiji]]. Ghoiji's government was corrupt and fell into chaos and finally rebellion. Ghoiji's ''apa qaghan'', his assistant and brother [[Shajji Hoijarek]], stepped in, gathering capable advisors to his side and becoming ''qaghan'' in his place.

Over the next two decades, Hoijarek worked to reestablish order in Jugicha and revive Tsu-tsu prosperity. He welded the Tsu-tsu together by holding a strong front against the Fankiang and Li-Raz. When Fankiang raiders killed Hoijarek's own wife and children, all the Tsu-tsu swore a vow of vengeance with him. Hoijarek also conquered a number of lesser neighboring tribes by slaying their livestock and poisoning their water supplies to force them to submit to the Tsu-tsu.

Hoijarek hatched a scheme to lure the Fankiang into a trap. In {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, he ordered forty [[camel]]s be stained white,

In {{YearlinkConvert|2609|SY}}, Aghul Balai of the Tsu-Tsu was among the teachers, magical advisors, and agents of Second Empress [[Bayalun]] of the [[Tuigan]] at [[Quaraband]]. Aghul sought to convert Bayalun to the Way.

==Government==
The ruler, or ''qaghan'', of the Tsu-tsu around {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}} was Shajji Hoijarek. The ''qaghan'' ruled from the city of Jugicha.

==Relations==
The Tsu-tsu and the Fankiang were bitter enemies since the failed conquest, but they maintained an uneasy peace.

Similarly, the treaty between the Tsu-tsu and the Kashghun was still in place after the abandoned alliance, yet had no real significance.
