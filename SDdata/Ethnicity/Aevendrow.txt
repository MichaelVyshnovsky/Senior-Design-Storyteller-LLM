'''Aevendrow''', or '''starlight elves''', were an extremely rare and distinct type of [[drow]] that lived in the frozen [[North]].{{Cite web/Legend of Drizzt}}

==Description==
Aevendrow were proficient [[mage]]s and extraordinarily secretive. Because of this, almost nobody knew of them.

==Society==
Their society was far different to that of [[Udadrow]], the most common type of drow. Having rejected [[Lolth]], they retained their original virtues, and their society was opposite to that of the Udadrow society of [[Menzoberranzan]]. Aevendrow society was based in [[Callidae]], the starlight enclave built of ice, which was far to the North.

==History==
When the majority of drow followed their dark goddess, Lolth, into the deep confines of the [[Underdark]], a small minority did not. Aevendrow, as these drow would become called, relocated to the far north of [[Faer√ªn]] and established Callidae, which would become their new home.
