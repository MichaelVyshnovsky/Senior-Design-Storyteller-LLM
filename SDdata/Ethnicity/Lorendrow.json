        "History": "Lorendrow were one of the two dark elven groups to reject [[Lolth]]. Whilst almost all of them ([[Udadrow]]) followed the Spider Queen's ways, and the Aevendrow headed north, the Lorendrow began a very long trip to the south.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], they remained so well concealed by the dense jungle that not even the most well-travelled explorers knew of their existence. However, some of the [[aevendrow]] in the city of [[Callidae]] far to the north knew of their existence and their city."
