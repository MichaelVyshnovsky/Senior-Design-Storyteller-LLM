The '''Arkaiun''' were a human ethnic group residing primarily in [[Dambrath]] but also in [[Halruaa]] and the [[Shaar]]. Arkaiun culture was formed through the interbreeding of [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] refugees from [[Shandaular]] and [[Illuskan]] tribes. As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the Dambrathan Arkaiuns lived as servitors of the half-[[drow]] [[Crinti]]. The Arkaiuns were called the '''Shebali''', or "lower ones", by the Crinti.

==Etymology==
Scholars debate the true etymology of the name "Arkainun". Some claimed that it translated into [[Common]] as "people of the wind". Others argued that they took their name from the mythological king of [[Ashanath]], [[Arkaius]] the Archmage.

==Description==
[[File:Females of the South.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''An Arkaiun woman shown third from the left.'']]
Arkaiuns tended to be short and swarthy with black or dark brown hair. leading to tanned skin.

==Society==
Arkaiuns living in Dambrath were considered second-class citizens and often worked at manual labor. Outside Dambrath some traditional Arkaiuns continued to live a nomadic lifestyle.

[[Horse]]s were very important to Arkaiun culture, and nearly every child learned to ride one before his or her fifth birthday.

===Religion===
In 1374 DR, Arkaiuns in Dambrath were forced to worship [[Loviatar]] or [[Lloth]]. Those living outside Dambrath often worshiped [[Tempus]] and sometimes [[Malar]].

===Language===
The original language of the Arkaiuns seems to have been [[Akalan]],{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}} and most of the Arkaiuns in Dambrath still spoke that tongue. which was a creole. Only a small percentage were literate. Second languages sometimes spoken included [[Illuskan language|Illuskan]], [[Halruaan language|Halruaan]], [[Shaaran language|Shaaran]], and [[Undercommon]].

Arkaiuns living in the outlaw [[Swagdar]] wastes spoke a dialect of Akalan called Swag creole.

===Combat===
Arkaiuns favored ranged weapons, because of the open grasslands in their homelands, such as [[crossbow]]s, [[javelin]]s, and [[sling]]s. For melee weapons, they tended to use [[dagger]]s, [[short sword]]s, and [[rapier]]s. Because of the temperature of the south, the Arkaiuns rarely wore heavy armor or heavy shields.

==History==

The Arkaiuns could trace their origins to the fall of the city of Shandaular in [[Ashanath]] in the far north in {{Yearlink|-946}}. Refugees from the city fled through a portal to the [[Council Hills]] area in the Shaar. Their king, Arkaius the Archmage, remained behind to close the portal, and it is from Arkaius that they supposedly took their name. For several centuries, the Arkaiuns roamed the Council Hills region, interbreeding with a lost tribe of Illuskans.

The Arkaiuns, under the influence of the [[demon lord]] [[Eltab]], attempted an invasion of [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]] in the {{YearlinkName|202}}. After Eltab's defeat in the {{YearlinkName|204}}, the Arkaiuns were harried by the armies of Unther and Mulhorand over the next seven years, eventually fleeing south from the Council Hills in the {{YearlinkName|211}} to the [[Bay of Dancing Dolphins]]. In the ninth century DR, the Arkaiuns discovered the [[Underdark]] and attempted to capture a [[drow]] city. Instead they were enslaved by the drow and lived as servants of drow and [[half-drow]] thereafter.
