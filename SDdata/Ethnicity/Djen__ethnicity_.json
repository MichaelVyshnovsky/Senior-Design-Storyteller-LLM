        "mainbody": "he Djen were one of the two major subethnicities of the Calishites. They formed the ruling class of Calimshan.\nDjen humans were shorter and duskier-skinned than most other people groups, including other Calishites, with dark brown hair and eyes as well. Occasionally, a Djen with red or lighter hair or blue or green eyes would be born this child was always considered a sign of the favor of the gods.\nWhen a Djen produced children with other races or ethnic groups, Djen features tended to dominate in the offspring.\nThe Djen were descendants of the human slaves brought by Calim which included not only the human slaves but also the whole group of genies and their servants of other races. After the fall of Calim, the Djen became the nobles and rulers of Calimshan. Unlike the Tethans, this grouping of people tended to intermarry less frequently and were thus considered more \"pure\". About 30% of humans in Calimshan were members of this racial group."
