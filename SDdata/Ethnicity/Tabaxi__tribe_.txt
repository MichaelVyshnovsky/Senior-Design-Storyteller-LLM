The '''Tabaxi''' were the largest tribe of [[human]]s in [[Chult]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. When most people referred to [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultans]], they were speaking of members of this tribe, as the Tabaxi had absorbed most of the other Chultan tribes.<ref name=TGHR-p43>

==History==
Alongside the [[Eshowe]] and [[Thinguth]], the Tabaxi were one of a number of tribes that emigrated from [[Katashaka]] in {{Yearlink|-2809}}.<ref name=TGHotR-pp29-30><ref name=D:SiT/> The Tabaxi originally worshiped the [[deity]] [[Olurobo]] and his children, called the ''[[nyama-nummo]]'', with their lands ruled by [[the Sleeper]], greatest of the ''nyama-nummo''. Then, from around {{Yearlink|-3000}}, the [[couatl]] [[Ecatzin]] came and shared the message of [[Ubtao]]. Although initially resistant, some members of the tribe gradually came to accept the couatl's words. Then, on the [[Night of Feasting]], the Sleeper awoke from within the [[Palace of the Alliz-Dren]]. A woman named [[Oyai]] had been chosen from birth to be a ''[[Tarasajok]]'', which meant that she would be the first to be fed to the Sleeper on awakening. However, Ubtao had made Oyai one of his [[Chosen]], the first ''[[bara]]'', and she slew the Sleeper with powerful magic. Afterward, 300 canoes of people who had taken up the worship of Ubtao agreed to follow Ecatzin over the ocean and north to Chult.<ref name=TGHotR-pp29-30/>

Centuries later, the Tabaxi fought the Eshowe (the second-most-populous Chultan tribe) across the territory of Chult in a bloody war that lasted from {{Yearlink|-438}} to {{Yearlink|-122}}.<ref name=TGHR-p43/> In {{Yearlink|-137}},<ref name=TGHR-p57> the Eshowe had conjured up a dreadful shadow-beast that attacked the Tabaxi city of [[Mezro]]. In vengeance, the Tabaxi protector [[Ras Nsi]] hunted and killed nearly all of the Eshowe tribesmen. Shortly after the end of the war, the remaining tribes were absorbed into the Tabaxi and became known collectively as Chultans.<ref name=TGHR-p43/>

In addition to the Eshowe, the Tabaxi were enemies with the [[Pterafolk|ptera-men]].

==Confusion with the "Cat-Men"==
"Tabaxi" was also a term given to a race of [[Tabaxi|humanoid jaguars]] found in both Chult and [[Maztica]]. It has been suggested that this was an error in naming. The explanation was that an explorer from [[Cormyr]] saw a Tabaxi tribesman dressed in ceremonial garb of panther skin and was told by a guide that the man was a Tabaxi. Misunderstanding what the guide meant, this explorer assumed that all cat-men were called "Tabaxi". 

In actuality the Cormyrean explorer was not far off from the truth. The human tribesmen named their people after the enigmatic feline-humanoids.{{Cite dragon+/11/Lore You Should Know: Tabaxi vs. tabaxi}}
