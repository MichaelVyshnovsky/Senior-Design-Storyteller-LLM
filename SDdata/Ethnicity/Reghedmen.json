        "mainbody": "The '''Reghedmen''', also known as the '''Reghed barbarians''', the '''Reghed''', or the '''men of the tundra''', were the [[barbarian]] tribes of [[Icewind Dale]]. They eked out a harsh and bitter life between the [[Reghed Glacier]] and the [[Sea of Moving Ice]].\n\nEach entirety of the Reghedmen people lived within one of several tribes, each of which was ruled by a king. Known tribes were the [[Tribe of the Elk]], the [[Tribe of the Wolf]], the [[Tribe of the Bear (Icewind Dale)|Tribe of the Bear]], the [[Tribe of the Tiger]], the [[Tribe of the Seal]] and the [[Tribe of the Caribou]]. However, by the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] only the tribes of the Elk, Tiger, Wolf, and Bear remained.",
        "Description": "The Reghedman were tall for [[human]]s, sometimes reaching seven feet in height. They were blue-eyed and fair-haired, with hair of blond, red, or light brown hues.",
        "Culture": {
            "Religion": "The Reghedmen worshiped tribal beast spirits and [[Tempus|Tempos]], the god of war. Tempos was served by [[shaman]]s who revered their tribal beast totems highly.\n\nThese beast totems were great spirits, similar to those of the [[Uthgardt]] barbarians. Unlike the Uthgardt, Reghedmen shamans could not call upon a beast power."
        },
        "Relations": "Due to their combative history with one another, the Reghedmen collectively hated [[orc]]s.",
        "History": {
            "15{{th}} Century": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the tribes of the Wolf and Tiger barely managed to exist out on the tundra. \n\nThe Tribe of the Tiger tried to gain entry to Bremen during the winter of the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, but were refused by suspicious townsfolk, forcing them to make camp on the northwest shore of [[Maer Dualdon]] where they suffered repeated attacks from beasts. The Tribe of the Wolf took shelter against the wind in the lee of the [[Spine of the World]] near [[Ironmaster]] but lost its king in the journey. The Elk and Bear tribes were much more prosperous, although the latter had come under [[Auril]]'s sway and they had begun to exclusively worship the Frostmaiden."
