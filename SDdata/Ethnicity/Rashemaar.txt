The '''Rashemaar''', also known as '''Rashemi''' outside their native land,<ref group="note">While the distinction isn't always made clear through 3{{rd}}, 4{{th}}, and 5{{th}} editions, ''Rashemaar'' were the ethnic group native to [[Rashemen]], while ''Rashemi'' were the commoners who lived in the nation of [[Thay]]. were a human ethnic group native to [[Rashemen]] and [[Thay]].

==Description==
Most Rashemaar were short and muscular, with a hardy physique. They commonly had dusky skin, dark eyes, and thick black hair. Men were especially hairy and might maintain a thick dark beard; baldness was virtually unknown in their culture. Women often wore their hair long and elaborately plaited.

==Society==
===Culture===
Elders were respected for their wisdom and mental strength while children were expected to earn their place in the world, rather than having it handed to them. Most young adult Rashemi traveled extensively for a year as part of a coming-of-age ritual called ''[[dajemma]]'' (also spelled ''darjemma)'', resulting in a population with considerable worldly knowledge. A young man sometimes traveled with a younger member of the [[Wychlaran]] known as a [[hathran]].

The Rashemaar placed little value in the accumulation of wealth, and expressed no shame for their bodies. They thought of themselves as inhabitants of a harsh and beautiful land ruled by spirits and rarely displayed the arrogance of other human ethnic groups. They viewed life as a series of challenges to face and defeat and placed a high value on individual accomplishment and strength. They tended to focus on physical feats in Rashemen, while the Rashemi of Thay preferred displays of magical power. 

The Rashemaar people tended to be quite superstitious. For example, it was considered bad luck to seek knowledge of one's own fortune. In order for someone to ward off bad luck, they spat on the fingers, made a fist, and then flicked the fingers three times.

;Education
Formal schooling was not emphasized among the Rashemaar due to their strong warrior culture; similarly many Rashemi in Thay were not educated due to their status as a subjugate class in Thay. Despite this, many of their people managed to retain and practice literacy.

;Sports
A recreational sport for young people in Rashemen was a [[snowshoe]]-running competition involving only snowshoes and traditional [[doe]]-skin loincloths.

===Languages===
Rashemaar usually spoke [[Common]] and their national language of Rashemi, which used the [[Thorass alphabet]].

Common sayings among the Rashemaar included:
* "What good can come of alliance with evil?"
* "A wolf will always be a wolf."
* "There are those who think and those who dream."

===Religion===
The Rashemaar commonly prayed to "the Three"―[[Bhalla]], [[Khelliara]], and [[the Hidden One]], who were also known as [[Chauntea]], [[Mielikki]], and [[Mystra]] throughout the rest of the Realms. They also venerated many local spirits, such as the [[telthor]]s that were unknown elsewhere in [[Faerûn]]. Rashemi in Thay might pray to the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] or the four elemental deities, particularly [[Kossuth]].

==History==
The Rashemaar were descendants of the nomadic tribes that were employed as mercenaries by [[Mulhorand]] and helped win the [[Orcgate Wars]] of {{Yearlink|-1075}} to {{Yearlink|-1069}}. They then forged the empire of [[Raumathar]], which rivaled the Mulhorand and [[Unther]] empires in its day. 

In the centuries after, they fought many battles against the [[Narfell]] empire over the contested Rashemi tribal lands on the [[Priador]] plateau.  Finally in {{Yearlink|-150}}, the empires suffered a mutual defeat in a massive fiery clash involving an avatar of Kossuth and an army of fiends led by the demon lord [[Eltab]]. The armies of the Mulhorand empire quickly swept in and reoccupied the Priador plateau, and their descendants continued to subjugate the Rashemi that lived in Thay in the years leading up to and during the [[Era of Upheaval]]. 

For a time, Eltab ruled the lands of Rashemen, but the [[Wychlaran]] aligned with the native Rashemaar and the warrior [[Yvengi]] in {{Yearlink|-75}}, forcing the [[demon lord]] to flee. In the centuries since, Thay attempted to take Rashemen from the Rashemaar people many times, but were always repelled. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Rashemaar/Rashemi were the most numerous human ethnic group on the Priador plateau of Thay and in the nation of Rashemen. Minority groups could be found throughout the surrounding regions as well.
