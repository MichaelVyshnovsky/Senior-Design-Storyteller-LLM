        "mainbody": "The Muhjari, or the Muhjein, were a human culture and faith of Durpar and Semphar, and to a lesser extent Murgh么m.\nOriginating in Durpar and on the coast of southeast Faer没n, the Muhjein culture spread north as far as Semphar and also to Murgh么m.\nThey spoke the Muhjuri language, which was classified as one of the Mulani languages.\nMuhjari venerated a group of deities known as \"the true gods\". One extremist sect of Muhjari even banned priests who did not follow Muhjari from practicing their faith or showing their symbols. This sect rejected all forms of pleasure and vice and promoted abstinence and fasting. However, other devout followers were moderate and practical, seeing some vices as necessary for release when taken in moderation.\nThe Muhjein held that nature was something to shaped and organized to make it more beautiful than it already was. This was expressed in the breeding of new flowers, building formal gardens, and constructing fountains.\nMuhjari culture was particularly associated with a set of faith-based laws followed by many in Semphar and surrounding lands. These were called the Laws of Purity. The strictest such laws banned drinking alcohol, gambling, and other vices, as well as swearing and particularly blasphemy against the true gods. The more moderate banned only alcohol and permitted others as seemed reasonable.\nEnforcement varied from place to place. In the city of Dhaztanar in Semphar, the Laws of Purity were strictly adhered to, with a particular prohibition on alcohol inside the walls of the Medinat. Meanwhile, Port Ghaast in Murgh么m was predominantly populated by Muhjari, but the mercenaries there drank, gambled, and womanized regularly, in defiance of Muhjari law.\n* Caliph Abu Bakr, ruler of Semphar\n* Masudi an extreme follower and caravan master of Dhaztanar.\n* Rukn ud-Din Mahmud a moderate follower and caravan guard for Masudi.\n* Nasr-uddin the Lame a false prophet of Muhjari"
