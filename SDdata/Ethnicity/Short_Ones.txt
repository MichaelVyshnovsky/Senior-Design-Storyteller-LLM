The Short Ones were a clan of halflings that lived in the eastern forested mountain foothills of Maztica in the Pasocada Basin.
These small humanoids were extremely resistant to the native poisons of Maztica.
Most short ones were traders or hunters who fought with knifes or slings. If cornered, short ones could blend into their forest surroundings, becoming invisible to the naked eye.
Short Ones were isolated from other halflings of Maztica, and built themselves conical homes from mud and bark. They subsisted by gathering berries, growing some of their own crops, and hunting small game from the forest.
They had little contact with other races and were generally distrustful, although they were known to trade with the Nahopaca. The Short Ones were particularly fond of the turquoise beads of the Azuposi, but would not trade with them directly, so had to rely on other means to acquire them.
