The '''Kashghun''' were a tribe of [[human]]s living on the [[Plain of Horses]] in northwestern [[Kara-Tur]] or the northeastern [[Hordelands]].{{Cite dragon/349/The Horde: Barbarians of the Endless Waste|48}} They were among the tribes mistakenly called "[[Tuigan]]" by outsiders following the [[Horde Wars]].The name of the tribe is variously spelled as "Kahghun", "Khaghun", and "Kaghun" (one each) in ''[[The Horde]]'' and as "Kashghun" (6), "Kashgun" (1), and "Kahghun" (4 times), in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]''. It is clear they are the same tribe, but the exact spelling is unclear. The spelling "Kashghun" is adopted here as it is the most common. They were one of the three major tribes of the plain, alongside the [[Fankiang]] and the [[Tsu-tsu]].

==Territory==
The Kashghun lived in the southern Plain of Horses, over much of the northern [[Quoya Desert]]. Their territory bordered the lands of the [[Fankiang]], [[Quirish]], [[Oigur]], and [[Tsu-tsu]] tribes. They made their home around the city of [[Chegoyui]], the largest settlement in the northeastern  [[Quoya Desert]];

==Society==
They spoke the Kashghun dialect of the [[Chuchian]] tongue.<ref group="note">''The Horde'' lists "Khaghun" as a language in its own right, but the ''Kara-Tur'' sources discuss this as only a dialect of the Chuchian language.

==Activities==
The Kashghun were traders and from Chegoyui they controlled all trade routes between the Plain of Horses and [[Shou Lung]]. The Kashghun ran huge caravans of several hundred [[camel]]s across the desert.

==Relationships==
A peaceful people, the Kashghun tried not to get caught up in the inter-tribe rivalries and warfare that were common on the Plain of Horses, and generally they succeeded. had a treaty with the Tsu-tsu tribe (though neither paid it much mind), and enjoyed fairly good relations with Shou Lung.

==History==
Long ago, a great leader of the steppe called a ''couralitai'' (a grand council of the ''khans''), with all the tribes in attendance. During a heated argument at the council, the ''khan'' of the Commani and his sons were assassinated. The murderers escaped and were never discovered, but, after finding evidence against them, the Commani suspected the Kashghun and that the Fankiang protected the assassins. This led to hatred between the three groups, which lasted even into the midâ€“14{{th}} century.

Some time around {{YearlinkConvert|2500|SY}}, the Tsu-tsu and Kashghun made a treaty against the Fankiang tribe. Their plan was to attack the city of [[Li-Raz]] from opposite sides and conquer the Fankiang there. While the Tsu-tsu launched their assault from the north, the Kashghun changed their minds at the last minute and abandoned the battle, forcing the Tsu-tsu to withdraw also. As a result, although the treaty remained in effect a century later, its terms were almost empty.
