The CrintiSometimes spelled "Crintri" in The Shining South (1993). (drowic for "noble ones"), also referred to as "shadow amazons" by the Halruaans, were the half-drow and half-elf aristocracy and ruling class of Dambrath.
In 831 DR, the Arkaiun people were defeated at the Battle of Crimtar by the combined efforts of the drow of Tlindhet and one hundred and twelve priestesses of Loviatar, who later became known as The First. In exchange for their assistance in defeating the Arkaiuns, the drow of Tlindhet allowed the half-elf priestesses to rule Dambrath in their stead.
In time, some of these half-elf priestesses bore half-drow children, who became known as the Crinti.
The Arkaiuns, rebelled during the Spellplague and overthrew the Crinti destroying many Crinti cities.

Some of them lived at the border of Halruaa and frequently roamed in the Nath at the northeastern part of the country. The Halruaans called them "shadow amazons", because of their barbarian ancestors.
Circa 1372 DR, the high priestesses of Loviatar that ruled Dambrath contemplated opening trade enclaves in other nations, copying the idea from the Red Wizards of Thay, much to the horror of their neighbors. The enclaves would serve as trade centers and also as places of worship.
