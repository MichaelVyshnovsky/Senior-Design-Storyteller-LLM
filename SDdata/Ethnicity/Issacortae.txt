The '''Issacortae''' people inhabited the western part of the wild lands of [[Ama Basin]] in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
The Issacortae were medium build and muscular with black curly hair. Semi-nomadic tribes of Issacortae followed herds of [[elk]] and [[reindeer]], which they raised. Agriculture was practiced to a small degree, and fishing and hunting occasionally.

==Combat==
The weapons used by the tribes were usually [[axe]]s, [[bow]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[club]]s. 

==Society==
Ruled by their king, the Issacortae were the most civilized tribe in the northern lands. The Issacortae were not one tribe, but a union of many tribes who obeyed the king, called the Issacort Confederation. Each tribe was ruled by a chieftain, who served as both chieftain and military commander. The eight tribes formed a union that followed the laws of their High King and High Queen.

They spoke the [[Issacortae language]].{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|26}}

===Religion===
Usually religion had a very large impact on the tribes. They commonly practiced [[Wikipedia:Animism|animism]] and [[Wikipedia:Shamanism|shamanism]]. [[Shaman]]s could be men or women. Shamans were often treated with great respect and awe by the population.
