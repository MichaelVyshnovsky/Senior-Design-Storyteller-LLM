The '''Mulan''' were a [[human]] ethnic group non-native to [[Toril]], typically found in [[east Faerûn]].
{{Quote|''How great are the Mulan, of which Unther is the purest! How great are their works, how cunningly wrought! How skilled are their minds and how mighty is their magic! Let all nations praise the Mulan, of which Unther is the purest!''|An hymn sung by [[priest]]s of [[Gilgeam]] in the mid–14{{th}} century DR}}

==Description==
Mulan were typically tall and thin with a sallow skin tone and brown or hazel eyes. Lower-class Mulan of [[Thay]], [[Mulhorand]], and [[Unther]] frequently had significant [[Rashemi]] or [[Turmish]] blood, resulting in darker complexions. Pure Mulan features were rare in [[Chessenta]] because of mixing with the nearby [[Chondathan]]s. Mulan often had little body hair, ranging in color from black to dark brown, and all nobles and many other Mulan of both genders shaved any hair they did have. Mulan generally preferred simple, unadorned clothing, particularly those that worshiped the god-kings, so as not to outshine them. Other differences in appearance varied by region; for example, Mulan [[Red Wizards of Thay]] were often heavily tattooed.<ref>

==History==
The history of the Mulan was deeply intertwined with the history of the nations of Mulhorand, Unther, Chessenta, and Thay.

The Mulan were first brought to Toril in {{Yearlink|-4366}}, through twin ''[[gate]]s'' to another world created by wizard rulers of the [[Imaskar]] Empire. They were used as slaves and for many years their fervent prayers went unanswered because of the magical Imaskari barrier. However, with the help of [[Ao]],{{fact}} mortal [[avatar]]s of the slaves' deities from the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]] were able to circumvent the barrier and defeat the [[Imaskari]] in {{Yearlink|-2488}}.

Following the fall of this empire the Mulan fled from [[Raurin]], eventually settling around [[Wizards' Reach]] and the [[Alamber Sea]]. Over time they either killed or drove out many of the area's native [[demihuman]] and [[humanoid]] races, as well as humans.

For many generations, god-king avatars of the [[Mulhorandi]] and [[Untheric]] deities ruled these empires and this led to the development of a powerful priest class. Those who practiced [[arcane]] [[magic]] struggled under their heavy-handed rule and eventually rebelled, forming the independent nation of Thay, ruled by [[Red Wizard]]s of Mulan descent.{{fact}}  

==Society==
Mulan were a generally arrogant, conservative group, resistant to change and convinced of their cultural superiority over all others. In Thay, many even believed they were above the gods. Mulan felt they were more civilized, inventive, and capable than other ethnic groups and believed strongly in the values of order and discipline. All upper- and middle-class Mulan received at least some education, and apprenticeship at a young age was common. Mulan followed the rigid class structures of their society, and the practice of slavery was commonplace.<ref> 

They also had a strong tradition in the use of magic, but disagreed over the pursuit of arcane versus divine magic. The arcane arts were lauded in Thay, but distrusted in Mulhorand and Unther.

===Regions===
The Mulan had controlled the eastern shores of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] since the fall of ancient Imaskar. They had been the ruling elite in many different nations throughout their long history, including [[Ashanath]], [[Chessenta]], the [[Eastern Shaar]], Mulhorand, [[Murghom]], [[Rashemen]], [[Semphar]], Thay, [[Thesk]], Unther, and the [[Wizard's Reach]] cities south of the [[Yuirwood]]. They could be found throughout [[Faerun]] in other regions as well.{{fact}}

===Language===
Mulan spoke [[Common]] as well as one of the many tongues of the [[Rauric languages]] family, depending on their homeland.<ref> [[Untheric]] was spoken in Unther and used [[Dethek]] runes as an alphabet. [[Mulhorandi (language)|Mulhorandi]] was spoken in Mulhorand, Murghom, Semphar, and Thay and used the [[Celestial (language)|Celestial]] alphabet, except in Thay where it used the [[Infernal]] alphabet. [[Chessentan language|Chessentan]] was spoken in Chessenta and the Wizard's Reach. It used the [[Thorass alphabet]] as well as Dethek runes and was closely related to Untheric.{{fact}} By 1490 DR, it was common to hear Mulan speak Chessentan, Mulhorandi, Untheric, or Thayan.

===Religion ===
''Circa'' the 14{{th}} century DR, the Mulan of Mulhorand, Unther, Semphar, and Murghom were generally known to worship the Mulhorandi pantheon. Felines were also typically revered and considered divine agents.<ref>

During the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], most of the [[Untheric pantheon]] died and were absorbed by the [[Faerûnian pantheon]]. Only [[Hoar]] and [[Tiamat]] survived and continued to be worshiped. Mulan of Thay, Chessenta, and the Wizard's reach, if they worshiped a deity at all, were likely to choose from the Faerûnian pantheon. Unusual for a human culture, Mulan generally believed that the [[afterlife]] would be a mirror of the mortal realm, and thus prepared for it obsessively.{{Fact}}
