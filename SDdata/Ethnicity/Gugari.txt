The '''Gugari''' were a secluded ethnic group of [[spirit folk]] that lived in the [[Hordelands]] between the continents of [[Faer√ªn]] and [[Kara-Tur]]. They resided solely within the [[Hollow Crown Mountains]] within two cities in the valley nestled within its peaks, and were [[mountain spirit folk|descended]] from the spirits of those mountains. 

These people held on dearly to the traditions of the long-lost [[Guge]] kingdom from which they descended but practiced many troubling customs that prevented them from progressing with the rest of the world. Despite their efforts, they appeared unlikely to restore the glory of the past, which they so desperately sought.

==Description==
The Gugari a hardy people, somewhat smaller in stature than full-blooded [[human]]s. Men tended to be stout and burly, while women were more slender and fair-skinned. They were all marked by distinctive, coarse blonde hair.

==Government==
While it was decreed that the Gugari people be ruled by a monarch, that custom had ended with the death of their last king, some time before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. By then Gugari society split into two factions, each of which lived in cities on either end of the Hollow Crown mountain valley.

The eastern city became an oligarchy, with a ruling council of individuals that traced their ancestry back to their peoples' [[Kalon Doring|last king]]. The western city was ruled by a group of princes, whose lineage originated from the sons of that king. Due to the insular nature of their society, constant inbreeding led to genealogical effects among members of their ruling class in both cities.

===Law & Order===
Due to the negligence of law enforcement by the Gugari ruling class, the cities of the Hollow Crown Mountains were overrun with crime. Theft and more debased crimes were tolerated, and only murder was met with public outcry. Infamous or otherwise distinguished criminals were publicly executed in grand public displays during festival events.

==Society==
The Gugari lived in near-complete isolation from people in the surrounding lands. They maintained the traditions of their ancestors dating back centuries before the [[Era of Upheaval]], determined to preserve the culture of their homeland and bring back glory to the Guge empire.

They kept a strict social hierarchy that was adhered to by royals, middle-class, and commoners alike. The royal bloodline was held in highest regard, and lineage from it greatly benefited the lives of royals, even those of meager wealth. Anyone outside the royal bloodline maintained a place in the social hierarchy dependent on their profession. Social progression was all but unheard of within Gugari society.

Outlands were not warmly welcomed by the Gugari people, and were regularly interrogated by local priests or [[mage]]s.

===Dress & Fashion===
In the summer months, Men wore scarce clothing and women often dressed in thin, [[silk]] garments. During the winter, dense coats of [[yak]] wool were common, often dyed in earth tones. Only Gugari royalty were ever allowed to adorn themselves in clothes dyed blue or red.

===Religion===
Following the split of the Gugari people, the kingdom's priests sided with the councilors of the east and the realm's wizards joined the princes of the west. The priests of the east primarily venerated [[Niynjushigampo]], the God of Death, while the mages focused their studies on the arcane school of [[necromancy]].

The concept of death and the ceremonies involved were placed in high importance by both factions of the Gugari people. They practiced human sacrifice and regularly tortured prisoners to death for the pleasure of the ruling class.

==History==
The Gugari people descended from those of the ancient kingdom of [[Guge]]. The last known monarch to rule over a united Gugari people was the mad king, [[Kalon Doring]].

Following the [[Time of Troubles]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the eastern priests of Gugari experienced a schism within their ranks. Some of their order were drawn to the power of the god [[Sirhivatizangpo]], who had ascended in the latter months that year, while others maintained that Niynjushigampo still held dominion over death.
