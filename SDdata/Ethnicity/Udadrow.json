        "mainbody": "dadrow, or as they were almost-exclusively known, drow, were the most common variety of drow by far. Apart from extremely rare offshoots of drow (like the Lorendrow and Aevendrow who dwelt in secretive locations), all drow were Udadrow.\nThese dark elves were those, or the descendants of those, who originally became influenced by the evil deity, Lolth.\nUdadrow society was oppressive and xenophobic.\nDue to the authoritative influence of the Spider Queen, almost all drow followed her ways to the Underdark. Two offshoot groups, Lorendrow and Aevendrow, did not. As they descended to the depths of the Underdark, Udadrow society become more and more corrupted by Lolth."
