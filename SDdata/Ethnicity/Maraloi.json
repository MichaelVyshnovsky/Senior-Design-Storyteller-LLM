        "mainbody": "The '''Maraloi''', or '''Ancient Lords''', were a mysterious race inhabiting northern [[Kara-Tur]].",
        "Name": "The word '\"maraloi\" meant \"ancient lords\" in the [[Pazruki language]].",
        "Race": "The ancestry of the Maraloi was unknown to outsiders. Some thought them human, others that they were a form of [[spirit folk]]. and were counted as being spirit beings as Kara-Turans knew them.",
        "Description": "The Maraloi were known to be tall and fair of skin and hair.",
        "Magic & Technology": "Maraloi wielded tools and weaponry forged of [[bronze]], because [[iron]] was apparently poisonous to them.\n\nThey were said to command a potent and alien magic.",
        "History": "Legend told that, millennia before the 14th century [[DR]], the Maraloi ruled the lands known as the [[Northern Wastes]]. They opposed the [[ogre magi]], [[oni]], and lesser humanoid races, and maintained their dominance until the use of iron became widespread in the [[Ama Basin]], and thereafter fell into decline.\n\nTo outsiders, the ultimate fate of the Maraloi remained unknown. It was thought possible they were all killed, that they migrated to other lands, or that they joined with and were assimilated into the [[human]] tribes of the area. For example, several small native tribes (those unrelated to the [[Issacortae]], [[Pazruki]], [[Wu-haltai]], or others, and not more recent immigrants) of primitive ways who still wielded stone and bronze, not iron, were theorized to be descendants of the Ancient Lords. They figured in many local legends. Most humans thought they no longer existed.\n\nHowever, the Maraloi lived on in secret, dwelling in \"the great northern wood\".<ref group=\"note\">This forest is unknown, but is most likely one of the forests of the [[Ama Basin]], perhaps the more extensive forest at the far northern edge of Kara-Tur. This was a secret known only to a few outsiders, but included the Emperor of [[Shou Lung]] ([[Kai Tsao Shou Chin]] around [[1359 DR]]), who imparted it to trusted agents, such as a [[hu hsien]] assassin.\n\n[[Bayalun]] was half-Maraloi, being the daughter of a Maraloi woman and a [[human]] man.<ref group=\"note\">Page 105 of ''[[Horselords]]'' has a ''[[hu hsien]]'' assassin say that Bayalun's father was a Maraloi, but page 236 has Bayalun reminisce of the Maraloi as her mother's people. It most likely the hu hsien was simply mistaken. She grew up among them but married into the [[Tuigan]] people and became prominent as Second Empress Eke Bayalun Khadun beside [[Yamun Khahan]] of the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]]. She was also a talented [[wizard]].",
        "Lands": "Relics and ruins attributed to the Maraloi could often be found in the [[Koryaz Mountains]], concealed in its isolated valleys,\n\nThe ruins in the [[Valley of Nanayok]] in the eastern Koryaz Mountains were the primary Maraloi site. Filled with ruins, though mostly no more than heaps of crumbling stones shrouded in vegetation, it was believed to be a center of Maraloi culture and politics. It was whispered that places beneath the ground here still contained the secrets of the Ancient Lords.",
        "Legends": "The Maraloi appeared conspicuously in the legends of the [[Pazruki]] people, who lived near the Koryaz Mountains.",
        "Notable Maraloi": "* [[Bayalun]]"
