The Khassidi were a tribe of nomadic humans living in the Hordelands. They were among the tribes mistakenly called "Tuigan" by outsiders following the Horde Wars.
The Khassidi lived in the northwestern regions of the Endless Waste. Their territory bordered the lands of the Commani and Tuigan tribes.
They spoke the Khassidi language, a language influenced by the Raumatharan Empire.
The Khassidi were allies with the Commani tribe, whose territory was to the south, sharing a common history with them at many points.
