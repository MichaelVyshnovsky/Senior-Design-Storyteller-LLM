        "mainbody": "The '''High Forest orcs''' were a culture of [[mountain orc]]s dwelling in and around the [[High Forest]] in [[northwest Faerûn]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Homeland": "The orcs lived in small villages and underground tunnels in the High Forest, located around two days' journey from the forest's edge.\n\nThe orcs of the western High Forest saw [[Starshadow Vale]] as their sacred burial ground, and in early times had raised barrow mounds along the sides of the valley's floor.",
        "Abilities": "Owing to their woodland environment, the High Forest orcs were skilled in forestry similar to [[ranger]]s.",
        "Dress": "They often wore earrings fashioned of [[bronze]] in a distinctive style.",
        "Weapons": "They were known to craft [[dagger]]s of distinctive make.",
        "Religion": "[[File:HerneHolySymbol.jpg|thumb|right|''The High Forest orcs' holy symbol of Herne Hurkgruum.'']]\nInstead of the typical [[orc pantheon]], these orcs venerated a [[god]] of hunting named [[Herne]], whom they knew as the Wild Hunter or Herne Hurkgruum. For his [[holy symbol]], they used a single antler, usually drawn as a stylized pictograph or made of wood. Orc shamans of Herne commanded the [[spell]]s of [[druid]]s and even sprouted [[stag]] antlers from their heads.",
        "Relations": "The High Forest orcs counted rangers of the [[human]]s, [[elves]], and [[half-elves]] of the region as their greatest enemies. They were not particular foes of [[goblinoid]]s. They faced suspicion and even open fear and hatred in cities like Loudwater.",
        "History": {
            "Early History": "In the {{YearlinkName|691}}, Lord [[Erthaer Javilarhhsson]] of [[Delimbiyran]] led a host of soldiers and settlers in seizing the land of [[Starshadow Vale]] from the local orcs and monsters. Following the collapse of Delimbiyran into independent realms and civil war in {{Yearlink|697}}, however, desperate refugees turned settlers hunted the woodlands to depletion, logged the High Forest at an alarming rate, and finally began looting the orcish burial mounds that lined the valley. This came to a head in {{YearlinkName|702}}, when, enraged by the desecration of their holy sites, the nearby orc tribes formed the [[Horned Horde]] and swept through the Vale, killing Erthaer and his followers before going on to ravage the other realms of Delimbiyran.\n\nThe tragedy repeated in the {{YearlinkName|1222}}, when the [[Waterdhavian]] Lord [[Ornigar Tchazzam]] led a fresh effort to settle Starshadow Vale. They rebuilt the ruins but repeated the mistake that doomed Erthaer's realm when some ill-advised plundering of the nearby burial mounds enraged the nearby orcs. The Horned Lord and Tanglethorn tribes gathered in the [[Blackhorn Horde]] and overran the Vale, ending it once more.",
            "Modern History": "From late spring of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, High Forest orcs began leaving their homeland in great numbers and moving eastward to the [[Graypeak Mountains]], in an exodus known as the [[Gray Migration]]s. [[Loudwater]]'s citizenry were consternated and supposed the appearance of the [[City of Shade]] over the [[Dire Wood]] had scared the orcs, that there was a [[disease]] in the area, or that they were fleeing something or someone.<ref>{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/The Legacy Begins}}{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/What is the Green Regent}} Despite the fear and chaos, the orcs avoided settlements and violence and the majority of migrations were peaceful; conflicts and deaths were few, but notorious. A story went around that a [[Loudwater Guard]] patrol had found five families in a homestead east of [[Orlbar]] massacred by orcs and their homes destroyed, that the orcs had taken nothing and done it for kicks. Another version had only two families killed and all their animals, including the [[cat]]s. Because of such stories, [[Blaz Merrymar]] believed the orcs killed his sons and nephews, when it was in fact [[Hekkut|bandits]] of [[the Hark]]. Local [[paladin]]s, rangers, [[Scions of the Green Regent]], the [[Red Fellowship (Loudwater)|Red Fellowship]], and even some orcs themselves voluntarily patrolled the roads to keep the peace.\n\nSome of the orcs migrated to the Graypeaks, but others chose to settle in and around Loudwater. They establishing a shanty town in the south outside the Forestview Gate and went into the city proper to take menial jobs to make enough coin to support their tribes. When a pair of orcs were slain in the street outside the [[Red Boar Tavern]] one summer evening, High Lord [[Kalahar Twohands]] made the [[Decree of Reception]], granting the orcs rights similar to those of citizens. Yet old enmities would not fade fast and this was met with much opposition and many still distrusted and disliked the orcs and treated them coldly. The merchants, of course, appreciated them as a source of cheap labor. The orcs, for their part, remained peaceful and considerate.{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/\"Epidemic\" Plot Recap}}{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/\"Rat's Bastard\" Plot Recap}} Yet six more orcs would be found dead in the neighborhood of the Red Boar and left with a predictable message: \"The only good orc…\"\n\nContinuing the curse of Starshadow Vale, in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, [[Daela Swiftarrow]] gathered settlers from [[Loudwater]] and [[Secomber]] and arrived at the ruins of Erthaer's realm on [[Eleasis 17]] and began rebuilding. A small celebration on [[Highharvestide]] was spoiled by three settlers going missing, and their remains were discovered the next day atop a burial mound seemingly torn open by huge claws. Daela's investigation found an extensive network of tunnels beneath the Vale, inhabited by large numbers of orc [[wight]]s. Over the next few months, the settlers were besieged by orc wights and a dracolich. Their fate from this point was uncertain."
