For ease, they are assumed to be the same people. Taken together, it appears that the Laothan tribe was a dominant early Seng tribe.",
        "Language": "The Seng spoke the [[Laothan language]]. When the Laothan tribes came into contact with neighboring civilizations, they borrowed words and phrases for concepts and things they as yet had no words for. Most of these came from the [[T'u Lung language]], but as the Laothan pronunciation deviated significantly from the form, it was almost impossible for T'u Lung speakers to recognize them."
