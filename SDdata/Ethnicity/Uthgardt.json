However, they were more open to [[Primal magic|primal]] or [[divine magic]], and in particular they respected the powers of each tribe's [[shaman]]s. No Uthgardt would cut down a living tree or build a fire without a shaman's blessing. They believed that shamans' otherworldly abilities originated from their deceased ancestors.\n\nThe Uthgardt held their dead brethren in high regard, believing that their spirits lingered among the living to offer advice and assistance. most notably at the [[ancestral mound]]s that each tribe maintained. \n\nEach tribe revered their own totemic spirit beast, all of whom had their power taken by their god-creator, [[Uthgar]], and some warriors were said to be able to channel the powers of their totem to aid them in battle. [[Chauntea]], mother-in-law to the totem beasts; and [[Tempus]], the \"father\" of Uthgar. More often than not, tribesmembers who worshiped nontraditional gods would keep this a secret from their fellow Uthgardt.\n\nAll tribes were typically known to celebrate with a day and night feast for the spring equinox, summer solstice, and winter solstice. These celebrations were known as the \"Birthing\", \"Fullness\", and \"Darking\", respectively. Around this time a tribe's shaman would also seek out guidance regarding the coming months from their respective totem. in which youths would hunt down their totem's sworn enemies or opposed beasts to prove themselves worthy of full membership in the tribe.",

Each tribe claimed a swath of the [[Savage Frontier]] as its own hunting grounds, regardless of any intersection with lands claimed by other sentient species, including those from other tribes.\n\nA tribe was comprised of several different clans, each of which was led by its own chieftain. A Great Chief was selected from among these leaders, to serve as the ruler of the Uthgardt people."

        "History": "The Uthgardt originally consisted of [[Northlander|Northmen]] raiders from [[Ruathym]], [[Netherese]] [[Runlatha]]n refugees, and various others who swore fealty to the mortal chieftain, [[Uthgar|Uthgar Gardolfsson]]. The came together in the {{YearlinkName|100}}.\n\nThey became known as the Uthgardt after Uthgar Gardolfsson's death from wounds suffered in battle with [[Gurt]], Lord of the Pale Giants, in the {{YearlinkName|123}}. It was said that after his death, Uthgar was elevated by Tempus to be his [[exarch]] and battle companion. Individual followers took up worship of the thirteen beast spirits that Uthgar had claimed to have tamed, and formed into tribes along this religious divide.\n\nThe [[Red Pony tribe|Red Pony]] and [[Golden Eagle tribe|Golden Eagle]] Uthgardt tribes vanished into the [[Underdark]] in the {{YearlinkName|576}} and were not heard from since. Before their disappearance, both tribes shared the [[One Stone]] ancestral mound with the Sky Pony tribe and had attended the most recent Runemeet. Some residents of the Underdark discovered the descendants of these tribesmen as [[grimlock]]s living in and around the [[Cavern of Cloven Heads]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|705}}, the mages of [[the Covenant]] used their magic to create an alliance between the disparate tribes of Uthgardt in order for them to stand united against coming [[orc]] and [[goblinoid]] hordes. The mages tasked them first with hunting down and killing orc chieftains to prevent hordes forming behind them. Their first major engagement was during the [[Goblin Wars]] of the {{YearlinkName|753}}. Then, while fighting an army of [[ogre]]s, orcs, and goblins in the [[Evermoors]], the Elk tribe was almost wiped out defending [[Flint Rock]] and the survivors descended into banditry. The alliance dissolved in the {{YearlinkName|802}} when it could no longer sustain the losses that it was taking.\n\nSome time before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, a long-forgotten [[druid]] circle infected Uthgardt tribes of the north with a virulent [[pox]] in order to cull the population and exert control. Not surprisingly, the sickness went out of control and threatened complete Uthgardt extinction. To heroically resolve the problem the druids themselves created, the conclave crafted numerous ''[[ceremonial Uthgardt belt]]s'' and distributed them among barbarian leaders. Thanks to the belts, Uthgardt tribes survived; however, this only made their distrust of outsiders more extreme.\n\nThe events of the [[Spellplague]] of the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, terrified the superstitious Uthgardt, and they regarded the newly arrived peoples of [[Abeir]] as invaders. These anxieties reached a fever pitch when the [[Gray Wolf tribe]] razed the town of [[Conyberry]], wiping out both refugees from Abeir and the townsfolk sheltering them.",
