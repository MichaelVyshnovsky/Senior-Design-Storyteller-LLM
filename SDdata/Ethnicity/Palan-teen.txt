The Palan-teen were a human tribe in the Garden of the Cursed in the Tomb of Martek. They were descended from paladins and other good, martially-aligned adventurers who had sought to fulfill Marteks prophecies before the correct time, but were unable to advance past the Garden of the Cursed and thus were barred from escape.
Over time the people that would descend into the palan-teen developed deer-like speed and grace, fighting at a level far beyond their own.  However, their reduced numbers led to inbreeding, which resulted in minimal intelligence.
The palan-teen shared the overall Garden of the Cursed with another human tribe, known as the guilders, whom they referred to them as the "maddogs".
Palan-teen society shared much of its vocabulary, and even some laws, with their neighbors the guilders. This included stoning as a punishment for breaking the laws upon a particular hill within the Garden, known as the Mound of the Lawgivers. However, palan-teen did not have good relations with the guilders, though they were generally friendly towards outsiders.
According to the legends of the Palan-teen, their people had been guided into the World Above by a palan-teen named Sedarik when evil was brought into Mar-tik they had stopped the stealies (thefts) of the guilders ever since. They believed that if the doors of Grandal were open, the guilders would flee as the "great good" flowed across the universe.  
About three weeks before a group of adventurers bearing all of the Star Gems of Martek arrived at the Garden of the Cursed, the palan-teen had admitted a paladin named Percivilis into their tribe and made him their leader.
