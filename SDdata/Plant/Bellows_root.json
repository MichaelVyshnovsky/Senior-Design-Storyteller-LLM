        "mainbody": "'''Bellows root''' was a common forest plant that possessed emetic properties used in medicine and was found in the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].",
        "Description": "Bellows root could be crushed and drunk in a [[tea]] in order to provoke vomiting in the imbiber, [[human]] and [[dragon]] alike. Bellows root looked similar to another plant, [[maiden's milk]], which possessed antitussive properties.",
        "History": "Long before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, bellows root became a part of history when the logging camp of [[Hornhollow]] at the edge of the Wood of Sharp Teeth was visited by a senile [[red dragon]], [[Craum Straug]], whose dire cough lit the settlement ablaze. A traveling [[minstrel]], [[Aznee Fraystrings]], was tasked with removing the dragon and thought that he could prepare maiden's milk tea to help the wyrm like it helped his elderly uncle once. Aznee, however, made a mistake and made a bellows root tea instead, causing the dragon to vomit the tea out along with his draconic flame breath, incinerating the minstrel instantly. This vomiting fit eventually killed the geriatric dragon."
