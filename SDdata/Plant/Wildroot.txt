'''Wildroot''' was a variety of flora that could be found in the jungles of [[Chult]]. It was known to have medicinal properties.

==Ecology==
Wildroots could be found growing in groups of up to six.

===Uses===
The juices of a wildroot could neutralize [[poison]]s and infections when introduced to the bloodstream. Usually, this was accomplished by rubbing the root directly into an open wound. Each root contained sufficient juice to clean one injury.

==History==
The druid [[Arvo]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] noted the curative properties of wildroot in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Wildroots were grown in the gardens of [[Nangalore]] and could be found in [[Omu]].

As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, a whole wildroot sold for 25 [[gold pieces]] in Chult.
