Ardanthe was a plant found in the Kings Forest of Cormyr, notably in the areas around Dathyl, not far from the village of Espar.
Ardanthe was an aromatic plant. Its sap was crushed out of the pant and rubbed through clean hair to imbue it with pleasant herbal scent.
The Chondathan word "ardanthe" meant "strong heart" or "stirring spirit". It also was a popular female first name and a style of music from Sembia, Cormyr, and Westgate.
In 1348 DR, Florin Falconhand offered ardanthe sap to Narantha Crownsilver as they cleaned themselves up in Dathyls ice waters from sweat and grime of traveling through Kings Forest.
