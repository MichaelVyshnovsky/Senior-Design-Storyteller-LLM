The kirin was a type of tree that grew on the eastern side of the Thunder Peak Mountains in Cormyr.
The herb known as kirins leaf was derived from these trees. When they were ground up and mixed with certain reagents, it would produce a solution that was bottled and turned into a potion that reversed the emotions of the drinker.
