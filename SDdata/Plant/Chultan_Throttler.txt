'''Chultan Throttler''', known as '''nabuk-lai''' in its native lands, was a species of dangerous carnivorous vine plant found in the jungles of [[Chult]].

==Description==
When prey approached a Chultan Throttler, its vines emerged from the soil and violently flared about, throttling the target. As the vines attacked, the plant's stalks quivered, either due to disruption or anticipation of a meal. The prey of a Chultan Throttler was just as likely to die by vine hits as by being entangled, dragged underground, and suffocated by them.

==Habitats==
Nabuk-lai were found only in Chult and doomed many unwitting would-be adventurers who traversed the jungles. Not many stories of Chultan Throttlers existed as deaths by [[dinosaur]]s was a much more impressive fate, leading many visitors to the jungles unawares of the deadly vines.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a small specimen of Chultan Throttler could be found growing in a small enclosure in [[Mintassan's Mysteries]] curio store in [[Westgate]]'s [[Market Triangle]]. The plant's enclosure stopped it from growing to a dangerous size.
