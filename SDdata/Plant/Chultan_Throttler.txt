Chultan Throttler, known as nabuk-lai in its native lands, was a species of dangerous carnivorous vine plant found in the jungles of Chult.
When prey approached a Chultan Throttler, its vines emerged from the soil and violently flared about, throttling the target. As the vines attacked, the plants stalks quivered, either due to disruption or anticipation of a meal. The prey of a Chultan Throttler was just as likely to die by vine hits as by being entangled, dragged underground, and suffocated by them.
Nabuk-lai were found only in Chult and doomed many unwitting would-be adventurers who traversed the jungles. Not many stories of Chultan Throttlers existed as deaths by dinosaurs was a much more impressive fate, leading many visitors to the jungles unawares of the deadly vines.
As of the , a small specimen of Chultan Throttler could be found growing in a small enclosure in Mintassans Mysteries curio store in Westgates Market Triangle. The plants enclosure stopped it from growing to a dangerous size.
