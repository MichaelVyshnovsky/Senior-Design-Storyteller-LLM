'''Ash trees''' were seemingly sentient [[tree]]s that attacked travelers in the [[Burning Woods]] of the [[Shadowfell]].

==Description==
These trees appeared blackened and glowing with crackling, ever-burning fire. They were further suffused with harmful [[necromantic]] energy.

These trees were firmly rooted to the ground and could not be harmed by any [[fire]]-, necrotic-, or [[Psionics|psychic]]-based [[magic]], nor did [[poison]]s affect them. However, it was possible to temporarily stun an ash tree by causing it to become magically [[cold]].

==Behavior==
They behaved as if sentient and angry, lashing out at any creature that came within range of their {{SIAdj|15|foot|long=yes}} flaming branches. Anything ensnared by the tree was pulled back toward the burning trunk.

==Ecology==
Far from simply [[undead]] and burning trees, new ash trees could sprout as burning saplings and grow into full trees. As such, they could potentially be found not only throughout the Burning Wood, but inside the city of [[Evernight]].

==History==
Ash trees first appeared when the Burning Woods were created during the events of the [[Ruining]] in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}: when [[Mount Hotenow]] erupted on the [[Material Plane]], its [[Mount Hotenow (Shadowfell)|Shadowfell twin]] did as well, and never stopped.
