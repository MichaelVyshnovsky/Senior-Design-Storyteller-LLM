        "mainbody": "'''Mother'sleaf''', also written as '''mothersleaf''', was the name of a plant found in the [[Savage Frontier]]. Considered a [[herb]], it was noted for its curative properties.",
        "Usage": "When its leaves (fresh or dried, powdered, and properly preserved) were boiled in a [[tea]], it could cure a natural [[disease]] almost a third of the time. When drunk prior to the casting of ''[[cure disease]]'', it guaranteed the curing of [[mummy rot]]. Although some tried to apply powdered mothersleaf directly to an infected wound caused by a [[mummy]], this would not stop the rot.",
        "Habitats": "Although rare, it was found in many temperate and subarctic climes in the north, such as the Savage Frontier."
