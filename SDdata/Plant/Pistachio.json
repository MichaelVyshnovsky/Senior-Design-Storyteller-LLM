        "Availability": "[[Salt]]ed pistachio nuts could be found for sale on the streets of [[Tashalar]], a nation on the [[Chultan Peninsula]], where they were a popular handfood.\n\nIn [[Chasoln√©]], a place with no kings in Halruaa on the shores of the Great Sea, citizens elected a guild administrator who assigned an official who maintained the local supply of pistachio nuts.\n\nA Zakharan-influenced [[Bedine]] sweet treat called [[vauv]] was made using roasted tharra nuts, crushed [[dates]], and [[honey]] syrup mixed with [[wild rice]] [[flour]].\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], pistachios were consumed on [[Earth]]. Notably, [[Elminster]] and [[The Wizards Three]] consumed copious amounts of handfoods when visiting the home of [[Ed Greenwood]], including pistachios.{{Cite dragon/359/Goodbye and Hello, as Always|79}}",
        "Usages": "Some master [[thieves]] elected to leave behind loalurr shells as their calling cards.\n\nOccasionally, pistachios were used in preparing [[iron ration]]s."
