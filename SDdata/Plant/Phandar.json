        "mainbody": "Phandar was a type of tree found across Faerûn.\nPhandar trees had numerous curving branches sprouting from a knobby trunk. The branches faced away from the wind, meaning that a group of phandars almost always pointed the same direction. Phandar leaves were triangular and mottled green. Phandar trees were said to resemble ropers.\n* Phandars were found all across Faerûn but rarely north of the High Forest. Due to excessive logging, the total number of phandars were decreasing rapidly.\n* In the city of Ravens Bluff, two phandars stood in the high-walled back garden of the mansion of Dolphingates. These trees were personally planted in the late-14 century DR by the mansions then-owner, Greenleaf Thorin. \n* Another mansion in Ravens Bluff, known as Manyboughs, stood atop the branches of three massive phandars.\nBecause of its strength, phandar wood was an excellent building material. It was also used in the crafting of bows, tools, and weapon handles. Its multicolored grains made it prized in jewelry making."
