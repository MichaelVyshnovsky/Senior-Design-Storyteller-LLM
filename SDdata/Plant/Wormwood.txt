'''Wormwood''', sometimes referred to as '''absinthe''', was a species of fragrant [[herb]] sometimes encountered in the Realms.

==Uses==
Wormwood was among fragrant herbs and [[spice]]s, used in creation and preservation of [[mummies]]. Notably, mummies created in the [[Calim Empire]] smelled of [[cedar]] resin, [[beeswax]], [[sage]], and wormwood.

Inhabitants of [[Hammerkeep]] in the [[North Faerûn]] distilled an alcoholic drink using [[anise]], wormwood, and other fragrant plants. The resulting liquor – [[absinthe]], was green and bitter to taste.

Wormwood, or absinthe [[oil]] was valued at 500 [[golden]] [[coin]]s per flask.

==History==
''[[Herbarium Maleficum]]'' was a tome of arcane plant lore penned by Mage-Lord [[Colderan]] sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. The [[book]] listed wormwood among [[poison]]ous plants.
