Kaitlins weed was a plant found growing within the prairie lands surrounding the Hill of Lost Souls, located slightly southwest of the southern border of the great desert Anauroch.
Often confused with another weed called dragons breath, which was poisonous, Kaitlins weed was used as a natural balm treatment for common sunburn.
