'''Crocus''' were a family of small sun-loving and delicate flowering plants of lavender or purple color. Some species of these flowers were valued for [[saffron]] harvesting.

==Varieties==
*'''[[Autumncrocus]]''': a species of crocus found in the [[Western Heartlands]] in abundance.

==Availability==
In the Western Heartlands crocus was valued at 15 [[gold]] [[coin]]s per basked of these flowers.

[[Cormyr]] and [[Immersea]] were known to have a species of crocuses that bloomed with purple-specked flowers.

The city of [[Everlund]] in [[Silver Marches]] was known for its gentle flowering crocuses and their memorable sweet scent that hung in the city's night air.

[[Hordelands]] were known for its species of spring crocus that bloomed in pink and often could be found in clumps alongside [[dwarf lily]] flowers.

[[Ormpur]], the city in [[Lapaliiya]], was sometimes called the City of Saffron for its unique type of crocus that produced saffron. [[Ormpur Bay]] was the only place in [[Faer√ªn]] that had enough of saffron-making flowers for mass-harvest and trade.

==Usages==
When processed through [[alchemy]], a sublimate of autumncrocus could be created. It was then mixed with a certain type of essence to make ''[[potion of feather fall|potions of feather fall]]''.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was believed that [[Lathander]] himself created the first crocus flowers. That was believed because of the flower always reaching and pointing towards the sun.

Some [[nymph]]s that represented spring nature wore dresses decorated with blooming [[rose]]s, [[daisy|daisies]], [[daffodil]]s, [[apple]] and [[cherry]] blossoms, and spring crocus flowers.
