The plants could be used to extract a solution of night orchid out of them â€“ a liquid solution of the color of evening. That solution, in turn, could be combined with certain types of alchemical vitriols to create ''[[superior elixirs of arcane cultivation]]''.\n\nOthers simply valued night orchids for their beauty. One such individual was [[Shadowheart]], a [[cleric]] of [[Shar]] from the late 15{{th}} century DR."
