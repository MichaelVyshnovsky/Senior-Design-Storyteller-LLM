'''Bran''' was a grain-producing crop found in [[Faerûn]].In reality, bran is actually a constituent component of other grains, but is presented as its own crop in this instance.

==Availability==
Bran was cultivated in ancient [[Netheril]] alongside [[wheat]], [[spelt]], [[Timothy (plant)|timothy]], [[rye]], and [[oat]]s.

==Ecology==
Bran was affected by the [[wheat rust]] blight, which destroyed the plants and their grains during the time of Netheril. The spreading disease was cured in {{yearlinkConvert|3165|NY}} by the [[arcanist]] [[Candlemas]], who used a complex combination of magics to produce a cure and save the crops.
