'''Phandar''' was a type of tree found across [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Phandar trees had numerous curving branches sprouting from a knobby trunk. The branches faced away from the wind, meaning that a group of phandars almost always pointed the same direction. Phandar leaves were triangular and mottled green. Phandar trees were said to resemble [[roper]]s.

==Habitats==
* Phandars were found all across Faerûn but rarely north of the [[High Forest]]. Due to excessive logging, the total number of phandars were decreasing rapidly.
* In the city of [[Ravens Bluff]], two phandars stood in the high-walled back garden of the mansion of [[Dolphingates]]. These trees were personally planted in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]] by the mansion's then-owner, [[Greenleaf Thorin]]. 
* Another mansion in Ravens Bluff, known as [[Manyboughs]], stood atop the branches of three massive phandars.

==Usage==
Because of its strength, phandar wood was an excellent building material. It was also used in the crafting of [[bow]]s, tools, and weapon handles. Its multicolored grains made it prized in jewelry making.
