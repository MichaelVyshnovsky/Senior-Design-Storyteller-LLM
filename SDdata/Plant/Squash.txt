A '''squash''' was a group name given to a variety of edible fruit, or [[gourd]], found across [[Faerûn]] and beyond.

==Varieties==
*[[Ambercup squash]], a species of squash grown and consumed in [[Westgate]] along the [[Dragon Coast]].
*[[Carnival squash]], a large gourd with hard skin of lengthwise stripes of yellow, orange, and green, used in cooking and as a type of autumnal decoration.
*[[Summer squash]]es were several types of green and yellow squashes.

==Availability==
Carnival squashes were grown and sold in the Western Heartlands and the [[Chionthar Valley]] and found in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], as well as such roadside establishments as the [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn on the [[Risen Road]].

Squash was grown by the [[Huthduth]] monastery in the [[Storm Horns]] of [[Cormyr]].

On the [[Sword Coast]], squashes were grown in [[Calimshan]] since the days of the [[Calim Empire]]. Farms in the northwest were producers of squashes of note, including [[Goldenfields]].

Squashes were on the menu of the [[Sunflower Inn]] in the village of [[Dark Hollow]] in the [[Vast]], priced at 4 [[copper]] [[coin|pieces]]{{Cite organized play/LC/A Simple Pick Up|28}} and sold in the markets of [[Ravens Bluff]],{{Cite organized play/LC/Cravings|5}} where squashes were occasionally shaped like [[elf]] ears and fried.{{Cite organized play/LC/Monster Mash|8}}

Beyond [[Faerûn]], squashes had been cultivated on the [[Pasocada Basin]] of [[Maztica]] since the very early emergence of [[human]]kind, their seeds – a gift from [[Masauwu]], the Skeleton Man spirit.

==Usages==
[[Squash soup]] was a traditional dish prepared on the Sword Coast North during [[Midsummer]] festivals, especially by [[Church of Sune|Sunites]] around the city of [[Neverwinter]].

[[Squash stew]] was a similar dish from [[Chult]] in [[Southwest Faerûn]].

In the [[Raurin]]'s [[Oasis of the White Palm]], squashes were cooked with [[tarantula]] meat.

The [[Azuposi]] humans of the Pasocada Basin cut and dried squashes, keeping them hanged from the beams of their homes.
