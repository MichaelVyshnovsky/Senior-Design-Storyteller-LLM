        "mainbody": "'''Pomegranates''', or, '''araed''' ({{SingPl}}), as they were known in [[Faer√ªn]], were fruit-bearing trees, commonly grown in the wild and sometimes cultivated in the lands south of the [[Sword Coast]].",
        "Availability": "Pomegranates were occasionally imported from the southern regions (excluding [[Shar]]) to the Eastern and [[Western Heartlands]] as well as [[Sword Coast North]]. These shipments were often merely an afterthought, when trade ships had a bit of extra space. Pomegranates were considered cheap fruit as it grew almost everywhere in the south in the wild.\n\nIn the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]], [[Khelben Arunsun]] had an ensorcelled kitchen cupboard within the [[Blackstaff Tower]] that, when opened, brought forth an overbearing pomegranate tree, especially favored by [[Danilo Thann]] in his childhood. Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]] also liked to imbibe a glass or two of refreshing pomegranate nectar.\n\nPomegranates were consumed raw by the inhabitants of [[Anauroch]].\n\nIn [[Zakhara]], pomegranate, [[coconut]] [[palm]]s, [[banana]], [[orange]], [[lemon]], [[plum]], and [[fig]] trees were cultivated and often housed [[ashira]], benevolent tree spirits.{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|19-20}} The [[Pearl Cities]], wealthy Zakharan port cities, cultivated many legumes, fruits, and vegetables, inclusion pomegranates.\n\nOutside of the [[Prime Material plane]], pomegranates could be found in the [[Feywild]]. [[Archfey]] [[Neifion]] served these crimson fruits in his [[Darroch Castle]] in [[1396 DR]].",
        "Usage": "*In the southern regions, pomegranates got more use in making sauces or [[dye]]s, rather than eating them raw.\n*In [[Calimshan]], pomegranate and [[grape]] juice was a popular libation.\n*Some variations of [[Mummy|mummification]] process included several preserving and aerobatic plants and substances, such as [[cinnamon]], [[ginger]], [[rose]], [[myrrh]], [[frankincense]], and pomegranate.\n*In the land of [[Thay]], pomegranates were candied and served as sweet treats, loved even by cruel [[Zulkir]]s of the [[Red Wizards]].\n*Pomegranate seeds were known to be used by [[wizard]]s as a material component of certain spells.\n*Pomegranates possessed some medicinal properties, namely, it was used as a nerve sedative, and a wormer agent.",
        "Significance": "*There was a fable about a mortal woman who was granted passage through the [[lower planes]] a long time ago. The woman was given one single rule, not to eat anything during her journey through the path ahead. She followed them apart from one little indiscretion. She ate three pomegranate seeds. When the time came to leave the planes, a wall of invisible force trapped her and no-one has heard from the lady ever since."
