        "Usage": "[[File:Blueleaf wood.png|thumb|''A piece of blueleaf wood used in crafting.'']]\nBlueleaf leaves and sap could be crushed to make a bright blue dye often used in clothing manufacture in the [[North]], usually in [[cloak]]s. The leaves and wood could also be burned to produce vivid, jumping blue flames that were favored by minstrels and storytellers for special effects, such as mood lighting during sad scenes.\n\nThe wood of the blueleaf tree, known as bluewood, was used by [[Volodni]] craftsfolk to make weapons and armor. Bluewood was magically treated to become as hard as steel, though it weighed half as much.",
