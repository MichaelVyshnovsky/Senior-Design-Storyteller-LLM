'''Constrictor weed''' was a type of dangerous plant that could entangle and restrain an unwitting explorer.

==Habitats==
Constrictor weed was a common weed in the jungles of [[Chult]], often hiding under rotting vegetation. Once a traveler stepped on a plot of constrictor weed, they became stunned and entangled, until able to break or cut themselves free.
