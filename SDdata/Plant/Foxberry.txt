'''Foxberry''' was a snaky vine that grew in the [[Midwood]] area of the forest of [[Cormanthor]], often near [[beech]] trees.<ref>

==Description==
It had yellow, greasy, [[grape]]-like berries that smelled like meat. These berries could even be eaten by the meat-eaters in the forest, such as [[wolves]]. However, despite their smell, fxberries tasted like dirt to [[human]]s.<ref>
