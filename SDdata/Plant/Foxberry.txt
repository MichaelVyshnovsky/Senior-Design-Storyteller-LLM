Foxberry was a snaky vine that grew in the Midwood area of the forest of Cormanthor, often near beech trees.
It had yellow, greasy, grape-like berries that smelled like meat. These berries could even be eaten by the meat-eaters in the forest, such as wolves. However, despite their smell, fxberries tasted like dirt to humans.
