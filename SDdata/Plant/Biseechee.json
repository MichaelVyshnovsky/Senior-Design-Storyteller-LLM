        "mainbody": "Biseechee were a type of berry-producing bush native to the Malatran Plateau.\nThe biseechee was a short bush with slender branches, whose stems were covered with tiny thorns similar to that of a cactus. They grew four-petal flowers that were delicate and white in color.\nThe berries that grew on this bush had incredible healing properties, but once plucked from the biseechee this property remained in them for only the period of a single day.\nBiseechee grew in dry soil, near the edges of the Rayanna Savannah of the Malatran Plateau.\nMany of the Nubari believed that these bushes were a gift to them from the ancients."
