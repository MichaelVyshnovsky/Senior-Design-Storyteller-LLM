        "Description": "A jasmine shrub flowered abundantly. Each small white flower had four or five long petals. Jasmine plan flowers had gentle blue hue in the spring.",
        "Uses": "''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold jasmine oil (3 [[gp]] per {{SI|2|oz|long=yes}}), Jasmine Night perfume (1 gp per vial), and jasmine-scented water (35 [[sp]] per {{SI|1|oz|long=yes}}))\n\nInhabitants of [[Myth Drannor]] used jasmine plants to create delicate and alluring perfumes. One such inhabitant, [[Elena]] radiated the aroma of jasmine long after death while haunting the ruins of the city.\n\n[[Jasmine dust]] was an aromatic perfume-like powder imported from [[Kara-Tur]].\n\n''Circa'' [[1367 DR]], the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] in [[Zakhara]] was purchasing copious amounts of jasmine of the [[Grand Caliph]]'s Private BathsÂ after he started fancying the flower's aroma.\n\n''Circa'' 1367 DR, the [[Jasmine Dream]] inn was located in the city of [[Dihliz]], owned by a [[gnome]] named [[Ahmad]]. The inn was poshly decorated and abundantly perfumed with fresh jasmine flowers."
