'''Melon''' was a plant bearing fleshy sweet fruit that varied in color from yellow to green, commonly grown in [[Velarsburg]] and the [[Dalelands]].

{{quote|''I winced as [[ghoul|it]] slammed its heads into the stone again. The sound reminded me of my mother at the market, and how she used to thump melons. She would listen for that exact sound - only she and other women seem to know - that meant the melon was ripe. Somehow, I just knew she would pronounce this melon as rotten.''|The lone hero of the [[Descent to Undermountain]] dealing with an insane ghoul.}}

==Usage==
Melons were often consumed raw for their sweetness and refreshing flavor.

Like other types of fruit, melons were used to make sweet [[pie]]s, such as those served in [[Harfin Draether]] tavern of [[Athkatla]].

[[Mango-honeydew-ant pie‎]]s were made on the [[Malatran Plateau]] during the annual [[Festival of Chief Booda]].{{Cite living jungle/Mama Needs Her New Pair of Shu|3}}
