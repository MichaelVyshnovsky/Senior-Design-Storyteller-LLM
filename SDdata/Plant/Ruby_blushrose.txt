The ruby blushrose was a flowering plant that grew within the Rose Garden in the Battle of Bones and other areas of Toril.
The flower of this plant was bright red, larger than other roses, and lacked thorns. The ruby blushrose gave off a pleasing aroma that made most humans blush when they smelled it but was actually an airborne poison.
This flower was used in perfumes by inhabitants of Kara-Tur. Prolonged exposure to the aromas was believed to cause debilitating exhaustion and light-headedness, which some romantics simply attributed to falling in love. It was suspected that the disorientation one experienced within the Rose Garden was partly caused by this plant.
