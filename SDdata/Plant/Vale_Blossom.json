        "mainbody": "The Vale Blossom was a curative flower, a legendary panacea, found growing only in the Dragonbone Vale in the Sword Mountains.\nVale Blossom was a small, vibrant blue flower, often clustered together in patches in the Whetstone Thicket forest of the valley. It was said that the Vale Blossom could cure almost any affliction.\nThe first appearance of the Vale Blossom was recorded by the dwarves of the kingdom of Keldegonnâ€”an ancient fortress in the Dragonbone Vale. That record told the story of a miner who consumed toxic tarnshroom while working in the tunnels underneath the fortress. The miner collapsed with a burning fever and fell into a coma. No medicine nor magic could alleviate that condition. Then his wife met a benevolent dragon, who led her to a patch of flowers in the shade within the Whetstone Thicket. The wife brewed tea using the Vale Blossom and gave it to her husband. Astonished, she noticed that her husbands fever had broke immediately. He was back to full health within a week. People said the miner returned to work in the best shape of his life.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Elminster Aumar sent a group of adventurers to gather these miraculous flowers, which were a component in a magical ritual that kept the life-draining corruption of the Scaleblight Summit at bay."
