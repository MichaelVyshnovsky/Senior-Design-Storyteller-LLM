        "mainbody": "The '''Vale Blossom''' was a curative flower, a legendary panacea, found growing only in the [[Dragonbone Vale]] in the [[Sword Mountains]].\n\n{{quote|This must be the Vale Blossom. Oof! Just look at this thing; it's blinding! If I stare at it much longer, I might get a headache! Ha ha ha! Oh, well...|[[Etrien]] of [[Neverwinter]]}}",
        "Description": "Vale Blossom was a small, vibrant blue flower, often clustered together in patches in the [[Whetstone Thicket]] forest of the valley. It was said that the Vale Blossom could cure almost any affliction.",
        "History": "The first appearance of the Vale Blossom was recorded by the [[dwarves]] of the kingdom of [[Keldegonn]]â€”an ancient fortress in the Dragonbone Vale. That record told the story of a miner who consumed toxic [[tarnshroom]] while working in the tunnels underneath the fortress. The miner collapsed with a burning fever and fell into a coma. No medicine nor magic could alleviate that condition. Then his wife met a benevolent [[dragon]], who led her to a patch of flowers in the shade within the Whetstone Thicket. The wife brewed [[tea]] using the Vale Blossom and gave it to her husband. Astonished, she noticed that her husband's fever had broke immediately. He was back to full health within a week. People said the miner returned to work in the best shape of his life.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Elminster Aumar]] sent a group of [[adventurer]]s to gather these miraculous flowers, which were a component in a magical ritual that kept the life-draining corruption of the [[Scaleblight Summit]] at bay."
