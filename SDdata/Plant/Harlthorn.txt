The '''harlthorn''' was a variety of bush that grew throughout the [[Heartlands]] of [[Faer√ªn]]. It was known for its use in the creation of a specific form of medicinal draught.

==Uses==
When the thorns of this bush were boiled down with equal parts of dried [[hoof-leaf]], it formed a solution that relieved a number of ailments: it calmed the effects of rage, grief, and delirium and soothed itchy skin conditions. When drunk, it allowed an individual to have much more restful sleep.
