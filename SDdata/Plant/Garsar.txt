'''Garsar''' was a type of root vegetable grown in [[Faer√ªn]].{{Cite polyhedron/57/The Everwinking Eye: At Home in Maskyr's Eye|20}}

==Description==
Similar to a [[parsnip]], garsar produced a white tuber that grew as long as a [[human]] forearm.

==Culinary==
The tuber was edible and had a sharp taste.

==Availability==
Garsar was cultivated in the following locales:
* [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]]; it and other root vegetables grew well in the vale.
* In farms beside the [[Winding Water]] on the [[Sword Coast]].
* [[Impiltur]]; the kingdom was famed for its garsar, [[blackbeet]], and [[spear tuber]]s and exported these to the [[Moonsea]] and [[Sembia]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|57-58}}

==History==
During the conflict between [[Valashar]] and [[Cormyr]] in the {{yearlinkName|375}}, [[Calishite]] soldiers marched along the Winding Water and seized an entire crop of garsar and more from the farmer [[Halithurn]], and more from other farmers.
