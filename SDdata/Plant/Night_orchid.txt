Night orchid was a species of the orchid family of flowering plants with deep dark blue and purple flowers, leaves, and stems.
Night orchids were rare plants that could survive areas afflicted with shadow magic. One such location were the Shadow-cursed Lands around the Moonrise Towers of the Western Heartlands in the late 15 century DR.

Night orchids were valued for their alchemical properties. The plants could be used to extract a solution of night orchid out of them â€“ a liquid solution of the color of evening. That solution, in turn, could be combined with certain types of alchemical vitriols to create superior elixirs of arcane cultivation.
Others simply valued night orchids for their beauty. One such individual was Shadowheart, a cleric of Shar from the late 15 century DR.
