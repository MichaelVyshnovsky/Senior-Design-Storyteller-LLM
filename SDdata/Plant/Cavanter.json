        "mainbody": "Cavanter plant was a bush or a shrub found in the Kings Forest of Cormyr, notably in the areas around Dathyl, not far from the village of Espar.\nCavanter bush produced edible swelling green cavanter buds around late Tarsakh. The buds were eaten by humanoids, as well as small brown birds of the forest, like the riskin. The buds could be eaten raw but were especially delectable when fried in butter. In terms of taste, they were similar to an olive or radish&mdashcrispy and fresh on the outside and soft, bready and chewy on the inside&mdashwhile their texture was similar to that of a carrot.\nIn 1348 DR, Florin Falconhand introduced Narantha Crownsilver to the joys of forest cooking, preparing her a hearty morningfeast of roasted rabbit, baked brownfin, and a heaping handful of chewy cavanter buds."
