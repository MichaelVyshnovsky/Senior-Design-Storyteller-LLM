        "mainbody": "'''Cavanter''' plant was a bush or a shrub found in the [[King's Forest]] of [[Cormyr]], notably in the areas around [[Dathyl]], not far from the village of [[Espar]].",
        "Description": "Cavanter bush produced edible swelling green cavanter buds around late [[Tarsakh]]. The buds were eaten by [[humanoids]], as well as small brown birds of the forest, like the [[riskin]]. The buds could be eaten raw but were especially delectable when fried in [[butter]]. In terms of taste, they were similar to an [[olive]] or [[radish]]&mdash;crispy and fresh on the outside and soft, bready and chewy on the inside&mdash;while their texture was similar to that of a [[carrot]].",
        "History": "In [[1348 DR]], [[Florin Falconhand]] introduced [[Narantha Crownsilver]] to the joys of forest cooking, preparing her a hearty morningfeast of roasted [[rabbit]], baked [[brownfin]], and a heaping handful of chewy cavanter buds."
