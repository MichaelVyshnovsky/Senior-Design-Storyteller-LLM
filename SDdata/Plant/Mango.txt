'''Mango''', also known as '''handsun''' in [[Amn]], was a fruit-bearing [[tree]] found in warm climates. Its fruit had sour smell very similar to that of a [[swamp blossom]] plant found in [[Halruaa]].

==Availability==
The nation of [[Thindol]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] had bountiful orchards of mango that grew along the [[Guthland]] and cultivated by numerous small villages and hamlets in the area.

Mango trees grew in the lush jungles of the [[Malatran Plateau]] where they served as a food source for its inhabitants, such as [[Shu]] and [[monkey katanga]].{{Cite living jungle/Courage of a Coward|10}}

On the continent of [[Maztica]], the jungles of [[Far Payit]] had groves of mango trees and Maztican goddess [[Watil]] was praised with offerings of citrus and mango fruits.

==Usage==
