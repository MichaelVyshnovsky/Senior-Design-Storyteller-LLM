'''Tamarack''',

==Habitats==
* In the small valley where [[Hartsvale]] resided in the [[Ice Spires]], tamarack could be found growing in bogs alongside swamp [[spruce]] and white [[birch]].
* A distinctive stand of tamarack once stood on the outskirts of the [[Sumber Hills]], until they were cut down to make way for the village of [[Red Larch]].
