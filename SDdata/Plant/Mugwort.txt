Mugwort was a common fast-growing weed often disliked by farmers and gardeners, but useful to druids and potion-makers. Mugwort plants often grew back within mere days after being cut.
In the Western Heartlands, mugwort was a common plant. It was used by the druids of the Emerald Grove to brew a powerful anti-toxin called the Elixir of Silvanus. The recipe for which could be found within the Flora of the Dalelands book on botany.
Mugwort roots were dried and crushed and alchemically processed into salts. This substance, in turn, could be mixed with certain types of alchemical suspension to create an effective variety of antidote potion.
