Drace was an herb produced from the leafs of the bittergar bush, a small thistle-like shrub which grew all over Faer√ªn, with the exception of mountainous or desert regions.
Drace was too bitter to consume raw, but when cooked it lost this bitterness.
* Drace was one of the ingredients of Spellslayer wine.
* When added to a pot, cooked drace could enhance the flavor of other foods.
* The medical book Disorders of the Nerves and Mind A Treatise features a recount of a man being cured of an "unspecific neurotic enthrallment" with the administration of a garlic and drace tincture.
