Darkberry was a type of berry bush found in forests around the Sea of Fallen Stars.
They grew in clumps hidden deep in the forests. Darkberry bushes produced small purple berries, only a few of which ripened each fall, and they were growing rarer every year by 1372 DR. Ripe darkberries contained shadowstuff when split or crushed, they released a circle of blackness 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide, large enough to hide a humanoid, for a dozen seconds.
A single darkberry cost 5 gp.
