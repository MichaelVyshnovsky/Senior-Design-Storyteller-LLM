Potato, also known as batata, was a type of tuber vegetable found in the Realms.
Maztican potatoes were claimed to be superior to the roots of the same name that were available in northern Faer√ªn, growing larger and firmer and staying fresh longer.
Rootstocks sold via Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue could be used to start a garden in almost any location, since the roots grew well even in poor conditions.
Potatoes were an ingredient in activating the rust-removing powers of bathaerel powder.
