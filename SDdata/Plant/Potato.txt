Potato, also known as batata, was a type of tuber vegetable found in the Realms.
Maztican potatoes were claimed to be superior to the roots of the same name that were available in northern Faer没n, growing larger and firmer and staying fresh longer.
Rootstocks sold via Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue could be used to start a garden in almost any location, since the roots grew well even in poor conditions.
Potatoes were an ingredient in activating the rust-removing powers of bathaerel powder.
