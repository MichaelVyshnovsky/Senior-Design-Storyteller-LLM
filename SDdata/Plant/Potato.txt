'''Potato''', also known as '''batata''', was a type of tuber vegetable found in the Realms.

{{quote|''Just look at the size o' these potatoes! Mashed, baked, or tossed in a stew, you'll love 'em!''|Overheard in the market of [[Daggerford]].}}

==Description==
[[Maztica]]n potatoes were claimed to be superior to the roots of the same name that were available in northern Faerûn, growing larger and firmer and staying fresh longer.

Rootstocks sold via ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' could be used to start a garden in almost any location, since the roots grew well even in poor conditions.

==Powers==
Potatoes were an ingredient in activating the rust-removing powers of [[bathaerel]] powder.{{Cite dragon/421/Abyssal Trade Goods: Not a Bad Thing|31-32}}
