        "Description": "Shadowtops could grow to be {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} tall, growing at a rate of {{SI|2|ft|c|long=yes}} per year. Their irregular, feathering leaves grew at the very top of the tree, having dark green tops and a coppery hue on the underside. The tops of Shadowtops were prone to fire.",
        "Usage": "Shadow-wood was fibrous, making it undesirable for building but good for ropemaking. The fibrous wood was good for cookfires as it burned hot and slow without giving off much smoke.\n\nShadow-wood was used to make magical [[staff|staves]], [[rod]]s and [[wand|wands]].",
