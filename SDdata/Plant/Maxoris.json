        "mainbody": "axoris was a spice and preservative that originated in the Eastern Heartlands town of Proskur.\nMaxoris was a white powder that was used by a caravan company from Proskur to preserve fresh meat for many weeks, which was a much longer-lasting method compared to salt and other spices. The main disadvantage of maxoris was the strong musty taste it imparted to meat, overriding any other taste it might have and causing severe revulsion in some people. It found some popularity outside of Proskur among travelers and explorers who wanted to have fresh meat on hand and didnt mind the taste, especially those who explored the far North where the severe cold made taste irrelevant.\nMaxoris was made from the seed of the maxor plant, which grew along the lower Tun River near the southern Storm Horns and Proskur. It grew to shoulder height and had long, drooping, fern-like leaves. The seeds were contained in a bulb at the top of the plant, with ten plants having enough to pack and preserve a  of meat."
