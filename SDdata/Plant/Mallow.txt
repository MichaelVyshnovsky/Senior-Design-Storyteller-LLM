'''Mallow''' was a [[:Category:Deserts|desert]] plant found in [[Maztica]].

==Usage==
Mallow was used by the [[Azuposi]] people of the [[Pasocada Basin]] to brew a "protective tea" for evening ceremonies. [[Pottery]] vessels of this mallow tea would be passed around by a [[sunwatcher]] just as the sun set.

Mallow was said to be a treatment for coughs and the [[common cold]].
