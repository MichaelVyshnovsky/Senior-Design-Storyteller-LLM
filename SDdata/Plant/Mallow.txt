Mallow was a desert plant found in Maztica.
Mallow was used by the Azuposi people of the Pasocada Basin to brew a "protective tea" for evening ceremonies. Pottery vessels of this mallow tea would be passed around by a sunwatcher just as the sun set.
Mallow was said to be a treatment for coughs and the common cold.
