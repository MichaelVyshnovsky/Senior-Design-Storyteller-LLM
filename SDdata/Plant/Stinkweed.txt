Stinkweeds were a type of foul-smelling weed.
Rubbing large amounts of stinkweed on ones body could cause an effect similar to stinking cloud, knocking them out for one to four minutes.
Stinkweeds could be found in the elven forest of Cormanthor, north Faer√ªn, as well as in the Lizard Marsh on the Sword Coast.
Outside of the Prime Material plane, stinkweed grew in the plane of Baator, the swamps of the plane of Othrys,
Some hags used stinkweeds as potion ingredients.
On the plane of Othrys, people were known to protect themselves against insects by rubbing stinkweed on their bodies. On the plane of Baator, stinkweeds were often consumed by grazing herds of stench kine.
