'''Stinkweeds''' were a type of foul-smelling weed.

==Effects==
Rubbing large amounts of stinkweed on one's body could cause an effect similar to ''[[stinking cloud]]'', knocking them out for one to four minutes.

==Habitats==
Stinkweeds could be found in the elven forest of [[Cormanthor]], [[north Faerûn]], as well as in the [[Lizard Marsh]] on the [[Sword Coast]].

Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], stinkweed grew in the [[plane]] of [[Baator]],{{Cite polyhedron/133/Stench Cow Recipes}} the swamps of the plane of [[Othrys]],{{Cite book| author = David Cook, Jeff Grubb, Tracy & Laura Hickman, Harold Johnson, and Douglas Niles| title = Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill| short_story = | date = | editor = Harold Johnson| publisher = TSR, Inc.| ISBN = 0786967013| pages = 0-88038-322-4| chapter = }}

==Usage==
Some [[hag]]s used stinkweeds as [[potion]] ingredients.

On the plane of Othrys, people were known to protect themselves against insects by rubbing stinkweed on their bodies. On the plane of Baator, stinkweeds were often consumed by grazing herds of [[stench kow|stench kine]].

==Notable Users==
*The [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]] used stingkeeds along with other unsavory ingredients to brew her rich collection of magic potions, tinctures, and brews ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].
