'''Yggdrasil's Child''' was a [[tree]] of great power grown from a seed of the World Ash, [[Yggdrasil]]. The tree stood in a remote grove on the island of [[Ruathym]] north of the [[Moonshae Isles]].

==Abilities==
The tree retained enormous power and anyone carving their name in the tree would grow in power as the tree grew. The tree protected itself with forest creatures it had enhanced with [[magic]].

==History==
[[Liriel Baenre]] visited the tree in the {{YearlinkName|1361}} to inscribe a rune on the tree in order to gain the power of the [[Windwalker (artifact)|Windwalker]] amulet. She was led to it and somewhat instructed in regards to it by [[Ulf]] the Shaman of [[Ruathym (city)|Ruathym]] town. She described the tree as a magical, huge ancient [[oak]] with dozens of complex runes carved into the tree. She also explained that it was the "symbol of life."

By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the tree could no longer be used as a ''[[portal]]''.
