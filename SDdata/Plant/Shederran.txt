Shederran was a rare species of trees found only in the Neverwinter Wood. They were highly sought after for their use in creating the highest-quality weapons.
Shederran wood possessed a distinctly pale green hue, supple and strong. Its tensile properties made it invaluable to the master craftsmen of Neverwinter, who constructed the highest quality longbows and heavy crossbows.
*Aryvindaire, a wood elven leader of a group that inhabited Neverwinter Wood in the late 14 century DR.
