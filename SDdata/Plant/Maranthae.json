        "mainbody": "The '''maranthae''' was a flower, most common in the area once occupied by [[Eaerlann]].",
        "Description": "The small flower grew in woodlands. It had petals that were gold in color, and rich blue at the hub, shading progressively between the two colors within a third of their length. The whole flower gave off a very faint glow, which it absorbed from available light sources.",
        "History": "[[Eaerlann]] used the maranthae as its symbol during its height."
