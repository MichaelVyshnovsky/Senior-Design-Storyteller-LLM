        "mainbody": "The maranthae was a flower, most common in the area once occupied by Eaerlann.\nThe small flower grew in woodlands. It had petals that were gold in color, and rich blue at the hub, shading progressively between the two colors within a third of their length. The whole flower gave off a very faint glow, which it absorbed from available light sources.\nEaerlann used the maranthae as its symbol during its height."
