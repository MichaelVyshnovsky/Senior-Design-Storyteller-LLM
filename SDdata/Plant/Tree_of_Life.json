        "mainbody": "The Tree of Life was a colossal tree that grew in the middle of the Wealdath. It was the source of great magical power to the forests elves, especially those in Suldanessellar, the treetop city built atop its branches.\nThe trees branches were so massive that they supported an entire city.\nWithin the nearby temple of Rillifane, there was a grove with a small tree that sprouted nuts. Some of these nuts could be used to regrow any damaged branches from the Tree of Life.\nIn the , the exiled mage Jon Irenicus broke through the defenses of Suldanessellar, captured Queen Ellesime, and poisoned the Tree of Life. He attached a number of parasites to the trees branches and performed a ritual that siphoned its powers to himself. He sought to displace the god Rillifane Rallathil from the Seldarine and take his place.\nAbdel Adrian stopped Irenicus before his dark magic killed the tree. The two of them fought within its branches and were both killed in the battle."
