        "Usages": "Anise was commonly used as a [[spice]].\n*[[Elvish seedcake]]s were delicious treats imbued with healing magics, baked using copious amounts of crushed aniseed, [[caraway]], and [[coriander]].\n* The denizens of [[Hammerkeep]] in [[north Faerûn]] distilled an alcoholic drink using anise, [[wormwood]], and other fragrant plants. The resulting liquor – [[absinthe]], was green and bitter to taste.\n* [[Spiced wine]] was sometimes flavored with anise.<ref><ref>\n* Besides its culinary use, aniseed was sometimes used by [[rogue]]s as diversion tool. When dropped on the ground behind them, a fleeing thief could usually successfully cover-up their scent, effectively blocking [[dog]]s from picking up their trail for several minutes or several hours depending on the dog's training."
