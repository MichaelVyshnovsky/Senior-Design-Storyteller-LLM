        "mainbody": "chinacea was a type of flowering plant related to daisies with medicinal properties that could be found in the Icewind Dale region.\nThe blooms on these plants bore some resemblance to black-eyed susans, albeit when the latter flowers were in a frail, limp, and thin state.\nThese plants could be used to treat bacterial infections, cysts, boils, and conditions of the nose and sinuses, as well as to purify blood.\nAmong the giff, these plants were used as an ingredient in Herb Tea 33-Alpha.\nWhen the giff mercenary commander, Lieutenant Prook, escaped from the neogi deathspider Erlir Fezrregal after it crash-landed in Icewind Dale, he carried written instructions detailing how to help him should he succumb to the elements. These instructions included what was referred to as \"Emergency Protocol 33-Alpha\", which called for the use of Herb Tea 33-Alpha, as most standard methods of restoration known on Toril wouldnt work on giff. A recipe for the tea was also included.\nA group of adventurers helped Prook acquire the ingredients necessary for the herbal tea. For echinacea, they acquired some from a masked apothecary by the name of Butiki, who in actuality was a trio of Icewind kobolds in a heavy fur coatâ€”Bubu, Kiki, and Tirr."
