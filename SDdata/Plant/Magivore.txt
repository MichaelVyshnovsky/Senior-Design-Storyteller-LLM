Magivores were a life form somewhere between a plant and a coral which inhabited the Underdark.
Magivores fed off of faerzress, the magical radiation which suffused the Underdark. As such, they were most commonly found living in colonies located in or near pockets of high faerzress concentration, and thus could serve as a warning of its presence.
They reproduced by releasing seed spores into the air to colonize new areas. These spores were drawn to areas of high faerzress concentrations, and especially to areas in which rituals or spells had altered the faerzress.
Both magivores and their seeds served as a food source for the Underdarks inhabitants, particularly lower life forms.
