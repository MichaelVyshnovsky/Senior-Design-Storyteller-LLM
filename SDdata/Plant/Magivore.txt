'''Magivores''' were a life form somewhere between a plant and a [[coral]] which inhabited the [[Underdark]].<ref name=FRCG-p218"/>

==Ecology==
Magivores fed off of ''[[faerzress]]'', the [[magical]] radiation which suffused the Underdark. As such, they were most commonly found living in colonies located in or near pockets of high ''faerzress'' concentration, and thus could serve as a warning of its presence.<ref name=FRCG-p218"/>

They reproduced by releasing seed spores into the air to colonize new areas. These spores were drawn to areas of high ''faerzress'' concentrations, and especially to areas in which rituals or spells had altered the ''faerzress''.<ref name=FRCG-p218"/>

Both magivores and their seeds served as a food source for the Underdark's inhabitants, particularly lower life forms.<ref name=FRCG-p218"/>
