        "mainbody": "Marlikkon was a fruit-bearing thorny bush found in abundance in the Heartlands of Faer√ªn, in the vicinity of Starmantle and to the southwest of Evereska.\nMarlikkon was a wild bush, not cultivated but commonly gathered and consumed by humanoids. The fruit was easily identifiable for its thorny hard outer shell, similar to that of chestnuts. They were brown in color and had easily opened, irregularly seamed shells. Marlikkons citrus flesh was shaped in purplish-gray translucent ovals. The fruit was acidic and sweet, reminiscent of tangerine.\nOnce shelled, the fruit withered and dried out swiftly, usually within just a couple of days. However, if left whole, the shell preserved the fruit for a very long time. Oftentimes, unshelled marlikkon was stored in sacks or barrels in food cellars, lasting for over a year.\nMarlikkon was usually eaten raw. The fruit was piled in a dish and served with a nutcracker or a wood mallet to open the hard shells.\nThe outer shell could be boiled to create a mahogany-colored dye, while the needles from the fruit could be used as crude sewing needles. The prickly shell was also used decoratively in various fanciful ornate desserts fit for nobility."
