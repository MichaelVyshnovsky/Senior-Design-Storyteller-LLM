        "mainbody": "ummer lily was a species of flowering plant known for its pleasant scent.\nIn the late 15 century DR, summer lily flowers were available in the city of Baldurs Gate in the Western Heartlands. Some used oil infused with summer lily to scent wax used in flower preservation. The concoction worked well on full bouquets dipped in scented wax, hiding smell of rot and decay, however, summer lily scent lacked variety and complexity."
