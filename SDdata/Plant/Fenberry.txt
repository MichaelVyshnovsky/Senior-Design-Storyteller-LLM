'''Fenberry''' was an edible berry, also known as '''cranberry''', found throughout [[Faerûn]] and [[Sword Coast]], often growing in colder climates and swamps<ref name=VGC-p82 />. The berries were often used as an arcane component.<ref name=NWN />

==Description==
Fenberry bushes were low-growing evergreen shrubs that produced small tart green berries that turned darker red as they ripened. Ripe berries were still hard, bitter, and sour and needed preparation before becoming palatable enough to consume.<ref name=NWN />
