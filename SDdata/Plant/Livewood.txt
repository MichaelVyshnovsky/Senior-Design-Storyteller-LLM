'''Livewood''' was a rare variety of magical tree that was found on the world of [[Eberron]].

==Description==
These trees were quite hardy and had a green coloration to their bark. Most notably, felling a livewood tree would not "kill" it, just stop it from growing any further.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[adventurer]]s in the [[Icewind Dale]] area occasionally came across bowls full of sap from a livewood tree. They proceeded to use this sap to create [[maple rot draught]], a special alchemical concoction, at the request of [[Seble|Groundskeeper Seble]].{{Speculation}}<ref group="note" name="Year">The lack of information provided in ''[[Neverwinter: Storm King's Thunder]]'' on the crafting material "livewood sap" makes it unclear if it was meant by the developers to be a reference to the Eberron tree of the same name or just a generic term. This article leans towards the former, but it is mere speculation.
