The '''Tree of Life''' was a colossal tree that grew in the middle of the [[Wealdath]]. It was the source of great [[magic]]al power to the forest's [[elves]], especially those in [[Suldanessellar]], the treetop city built atop its branches.

{{Quote|''From [[Corellon]], all began. [[Rillifane Rallathil|Rillifane]] grew.''<br/>''From the branches of Rillifane the Water flowed,''<br />''Granting life to the Tree.''<br/>''[[Suldanessellar]] owes all to the Tree.''|Excerpt from a holy [[elven]] ritual}}

==Description==
The tree's branches were so massive that they supported an entire city.

Within the nearby [[Temple of Rillifane (Suldanessellar)|temple]] of Rillifane, there was a grove with a small tree that sprouted nuts. Some of these nuts could be used to regrow any damaged branches from the Tree of Life.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the exiled [[mage]] [[Jon Irenicus]] broke through the defenses of Suldanessellar, captured [[Ellesime|Queen Ellesime]], and poisoned the Tree of Life. He attached a number of parasites to the tree's branches and performed a [[ritual]] that siphoned its powers to himself. He sought to displace the god Rillifane Rallathil from the [[Seldarine]] and take his place.

[[Abdel Adrian]] stopped Irenicus before his dark magic killed the tree. The two of them fought within its branches and were both killed in the battle.
