Laspar was a type of tree found in Faer√ªn.
Laspars appeared similar to "squat cedars". Their flat needles were olive green, giving the tree the appearance that it was dead. The needles grew in clusters called "shags" at the end of each branch. Laspar trunks had a dusty green bark covering golden-colored wood.
Laspar wood did not serve well for fires because it had large amounts of pitch that caused sputtering sparks. However, laspar needles were often used in candles and torches. The needles were also used for their scent.
Laspars grew as far east as Thay and as far south as the Forest of Tethir. In the North, they were particularly common in Turnstone Pass, Delimbiyr Vale, and the Far Forest.
