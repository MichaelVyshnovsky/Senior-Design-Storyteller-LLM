'''Bowen's flower''' was a small flower that popped up in scattered patches in the mountainous regions of [[Cormyr]] in [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]].

==Growth==
This flower was unable to reproduce well but rather it spread like a weed. It wasn't found everywhere but in dense plots some distance away from one another.

==Usage==
When ground up and mixed in a drink, the Bowen's flower acted as a mild sedative. While it wasn't useful as a sleeping agent in most cases, it was particularly effective against [[bugbear]]s, rendering them unconscious within minutes.
