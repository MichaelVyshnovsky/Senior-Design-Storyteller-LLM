Bowens flower was a small flower that popped up in scattered patches in the mountainous regions of Cormyr in central Faer√ªn.
This flower was unable to reproduce well but rather it spread like a weed. It wasnt found everywhere but in dense plots some distance away from one another.
When ground up and mixed in a drink, the Bowens flower acted as a mild sedative. While it wasnt useful as a sleeping agent in most cases, it was particularly effective against bugbears, rendering them unconscious within minutes.
