        "mainbody": "loodberry bushes grew on the plains surrounding the Battle of Bones.\nReddish-purple berries and heart-shaped reddish-green leaves characterized this bush.\nThese bushes were extremely poisonous in every part. Eating just a few of the berries killed most creatures within minutes. Chewing the twigs or brewing the leaves in a tea was similarly deadly. Even using the twigs from this bush in a campfire could prove dangerous, causing eyes to swell shut from the toxic smoke and making food cooked over the fire toxic as well. Surviving the poison still left one seriously sick.\nDespite this, bloodberries were reputed to be an ingredient in Turmishite apple and bloodberry pie, which was known to be incredibly tart.Its unknown if the bloodberries used in the pie are the same poisonous bloodberries used in minute amounts or a unique cooking method to eliminate or reduce the poison, are a different plant species entirely, or if only Battle of Bones bloodberries are poisonous. More likely, the bloodberries could be mistaken for goblinberries, which are similar, also found around the Battle of Bones, and can be consumed in a sweet dish."
