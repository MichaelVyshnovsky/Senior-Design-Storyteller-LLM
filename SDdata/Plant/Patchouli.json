These substances were used in the tribal bathhouses and in ceremonial religious cleansing before standing in front of the Simbara deityâ€”Vizerathu, the spirit of the Lion.\nDried patchouli was sold as an aromatic substance by the Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. It was listed in the Priests Alcove section of the catalogue and was sold at two ounces for a single silver coin. The same catalogue offered exotic scented oils, including patchouli lamp oil, and scented patchouli beeswax."
