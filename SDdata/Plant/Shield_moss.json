        "mainbody": "'''Shield moss''' was an appropriately named species of [[moss]] that grew and was cultivated for export by the hardy folk of [[Mornbryn's Shield]].",
        "Description": "When fresh, Shield moss was bright blue-green color. Dried up, it turned gray. The moss was still quite valuable even in its dried state.",
        "Use": {
            "Food & Drink": "The noble folk of bigger cities of Waterdeep, [[Calimshan]], and [[Tethyr]] fancied Shield moss as a fashionable dish. The moss was served deep-fried and smeared in various sauces or even [[wine-and-peahen gravy]].\n\nThis dish was an acquired taste. The deep-fried moss was brittle. [[Elminster Aumar]] once described the experience of eating Shield moss as dining on brittle [[corn]] chips, crunching on hard dried noodles, or chewing on a mouthful of twigs.",
            "Pricing & Trade": "''Circa'' [[1365 DR]], a handful of Shield moss was going for 4 [[gp]] in the markets of big cities, more when properly cooked and sauced. When merchants and traders traveled to [[Mornbryn's Shield]], they often arrived by boats and barges and purchased Shield moss by a boatful. Depending on the season, production, and bidding competition, a barge full of Shield moss was worth between 50 and 70 gp."
