* In [[south Faerûn]]'s [[Land of the Lions]] region, the city of [[Ankhapur]] cultivated pears.
* In [[west Faerûn]], in the nation of [[Amn]], pears were grown by the city of [[Crimmor]]. Along the [[Sword Coast]], pears were grown in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] at the garden of the [[Silvershield estate]]<ref> and in vast orchards south of the city by the [[Caldwell]] family.<ref>
* In [[Kara-Tur]], pears were cultivated on the [[Shao Mountains]] around the [[Sumitra tower]] despite the harshness of its local climate. The sweet aroma of pears and other fruits drifted throughout the tower's corridors.

;Crimmor Pears: Pears that were grown by the city of Crimmor. These pears were often candied and this delicacy was sold across Faerûn through [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']].
;Elysian Pears: Pears that grew on the plane of Elysium. These were considered to be amongst the most flavorful breeds of pears across the [[plane]]s.
;Purple Pears: A variety of [[magic]]al pears with a purple coloration that were developed by the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]]s of [[Ythryn]] and whose trees were tended to by [[nymph]]s. Eating more than half of one of these granted the ability to temporarily cast one of many [[spell]]s, though eating more than three within an hour was [[poison]]ous. The spells one could be granted included ''[[cure wounds]]'', ''[[druidcraft]]'', ''[[faerie fire]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[sending]]'', and ''[[vicious mockery]]''.
;Red Mountain: In [[Khazari]], the [[Red Mountain Monastery]] grew magical gold-colored pears that glowed. Members of the monastery that ate one of these pears were affected as if by the ''[[heal]]'' spell, while non-members would feel as though they had been [[poison]]ed for a period of two to twelve minutes.

==History==
The existence of pears on Toril dated as far back as the ancient empire of [[Netheril]].
