'''Kryne''' was a nutritious plant found on the isle of [[Moray]] within the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: The Moonshae Isles|10}}

==Location==
Kryne grew along the shores of the swampy [[Lac Dynnegall]] and [[Breasal Marsh]] found in central Moray.

==History==
The villagers of [[Dynnegall]] harvested kryne for their diets because it was easy to dry and highly nutritious. What the villagers did not consume was sent to [[Caer Moray]] and exported off the island.
