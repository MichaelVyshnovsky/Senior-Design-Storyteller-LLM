Kryne was a nutritious plant found on the isle of Moray within the Moonshae Isles.
Kryne grew along the shores of the swampy Lac Dynnegall and Breasal Marsh found in central Moray.
The villagers of Dynnegall harvested kryne for their diets because it was easy to dry and highly nutritious. What the villagers did not consume was sent to Caer Moray and exported off the island.
