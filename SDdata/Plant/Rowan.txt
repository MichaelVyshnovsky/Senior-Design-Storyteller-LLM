'''Rowans''' were a type of [[:Category:Trees|tree]] in the Realms.

==Description==
On average rowans could grow to be {{SIrange|10|20|ft}} tall. They also produced red berries that would induce a state of vomiting in most [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s that ate them.

==Habitats==
* In [[interior Faerûn]], rowans were one of the three primary trees that grew in the [[King's Forest]] of [[Cormyr]].
* In the [[Western Heartlands]], rowans grew in the [[Serpent Hills]] and the [[High Moor]] region. In the latter ecosystem, the vicious winds that were common on the High Moor stunted their growth, making {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} the maximum height they could generally achieve.
* In [[southeast Faerûn]], rowans grew in the [[Long Forest]] of [[Luiren]].

==Usages==
* Branches from a rowan tree could be used to construct a ''[[rod of resurrection]]'' or a ''[[staff of curing]]''.{{Cite dragon/101/Charging isn't cheap|30, 32}}
