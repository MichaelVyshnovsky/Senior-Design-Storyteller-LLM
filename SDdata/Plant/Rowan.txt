Rowans were a type of tree in the Realms.
On average rowans could grow to be  tall. They also produced red berries that would induce a state of vomiting in most humans and demihumans that ate them.
* In interior Faerûn, rowans were one of the three primary trees that grew in the Kings Forest of Cormyr.
* In the Western Heartlands, rowans grew in the Serpent Hills and the High Moor region. In the latter ecosystem, the vicious winds that were common on the High Moor stunted their growth, making  the maximum height they could generally achieve.
* In southeast Faerûn, rowans grew in the Long Forest of Luiren.
* Branches from a rowan tree could be used to construct a rod of resurrection or a staff of curing.
