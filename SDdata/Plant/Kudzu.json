        "mainbody": "Kudzu was a type of edible trailing perennial vine plant related to the common pea. Kudzu grew quickly overtaking and smothering other vegetation in the area.\n* Elminsters tower in Shadowdale was covered in thick vines of pink and purple flowering kudzu. The size of the growth suggested it was left unchecked for over a century.\n* Kudzu was very prevalent throughout the Long Forest."
