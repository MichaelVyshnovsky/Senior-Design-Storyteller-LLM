'''Senna''' was a small flowering legume plant native to the jungles of [[Chult]] and the shores of the [[Soshenstar River]].

==Usages==
In Chult and [[Port Nyanzaru]], senna leaves had many uses, including tanning [[leather]] and carburizing metals. Apart from its wide industrial use, this plant was one of the components of Chultan curative [[tea]] infusion, made with local tea leaves, senna leaves, [[woad]], and fresh spring water.

By itself, the plant had purgative properties.
