Senna was a small flowering legume plant native to the jungles of Chult and the shores of the Soshenstar River.
In Chult and Port Nyanzaru, senna leaves had many uses, including tanning leather and carburizing metals. Apart from its wide industrial use, this plant was one of the components of Chultan curative tea infusion, made with local tea leaves, senna leaves, woad, and fresh spring water.
By itself, the plant had purgative properties.
