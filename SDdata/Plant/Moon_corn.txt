Moon corn was a strain of corn characterized by its crescent-shaped kernels.
Moon corn was first cultivated in Vaasa. By the mid-to-late 14 century DR, it had been adopted in Sembia, where it was grown alongside regular corn. Despite not being native to interior Faer√ªn, moon corn had no noticeable negative impacts on the local environment.
