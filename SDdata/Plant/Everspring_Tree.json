        "mainbody": "The '''Everspring Tree''' was a gargantuan tree in [[Icewind Dale]].",
        "Description": "This huge tree was several times taller than a typical [[humanoid]]. Its brown-green bark appeared to have sections where it glowed light blue. The roots of the Everspring Tree seemed to have forced their way out of the hard, stony ground.",
        "History": "It is unknown when the Everspring Tree began to grow or first spawned, but its existence was first noted in the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The Everspring Tree became corrupted by the powerful magic of [[crystal cultist]]s, and trapped the [[Spirit of the Forest]] within its vast roots."
