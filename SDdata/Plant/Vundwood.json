        "mainbody": "The '''vundwood''' was a species of tree that grew throughout [[Faer√ªn]], particularly abundant in the hills of the [[Western Heartlands]] and the [[Tunlands]] of [[Cormyr]].",
        "Description": "These scrubby trees were relatively short, rarely growing over {{SI|15|ft|long=yes}} tall. Their wood was reddish-brown in color and smelled somewhat of [[cinnamon]], and were covered in thin, dark-red bark with many small outwardly growing branches. The leaves were pale-green and bordered with white, that turned to yellow when winter was approaching or as the tree neared death.",
        "Uses": "These trees were often used as firewood or felled and dragged into tangled arrangements to form pens for livestock.\n\nWhen vundwood was used in the creation of [[:Category:magic items|magical items]] it imbued them with a sort of [[arcane]] echo, whereby they gained extra changes every few months if they were not entirely depleted.\n\nIn addition, vundwood served as a universal replacement [[material component]] for both arcane and divine [[spell]]s related to the recalling of expended spells or the augmentation of a spellcaster's magical capacity."
