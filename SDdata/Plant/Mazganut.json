        "mainbody": "azganut was a species of large vine tree found growing in the southern mage city of Khaerbaal in Halruaa.\nMazganut trees were similar in size to the bilboa trees, found growing around Khaerbaal and within its many parks. The huge tree was shrouded in vines and was big enough to offer shelter to many creatures, including humans. The size of the tree allowed it to have a rich miniature biome of creatures dwelling on the trees branches, holes, and trunk."
