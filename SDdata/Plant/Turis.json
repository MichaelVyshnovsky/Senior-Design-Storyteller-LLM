        "mainbody": "he turis was a variety of tree that grew in the mountains of Cormyr in central Faer√ªn. They were most commonly found above the timberline in both the Storm Horns and Thunder Peak Mountains.\nBeneath the tough bark of the turis was a sap that was used in the creation of a restorative salve. When properly applied to less-severe wounds, it would heal them without leaving a scar. It would have no effect when applied to injuries caused by magical weapons."
