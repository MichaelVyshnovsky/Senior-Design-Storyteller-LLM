'''Feather Skin''' was a very rare species of flower native to the jungles of [[Chult]].

==Usage==
The petals of a Feather Skin flower dissolved on the tongue. Once they had done so, the petal eradicated all traces of any disease that the patient might be suffering from.

==History==
The [[druid]] [[Arvo]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] noted the curative properties of Feather Skin in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. He was unable to find very many of the flowers, and so was quite loathe to part with more a couple of petals.
