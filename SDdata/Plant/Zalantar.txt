}}'''Zalantar''', also called '''blackwood''' or '''darkwood''',<ref name=MoF-p180> was a subtropical tree that was usually found in southern [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Zalantars grew oddly in the sense that one plant was composed of several tree trunks that stemmed from a central root system. Their leaves were usually white or another light color.

The pure black wood from a zalantar tree was called ''darkwood'', or ''blackwood'' in the [[North Faerûn|North]]. The wood was as hard as normal wood but half as heavy.

==Usage==
Items made from zalantar weighed half as much as normal wooden items of the same type. Darkwood weapons and shields were thus very light and made to high quality but also more costly. Darkwood was extensively in the South in buildings, wagons, and wheels, and almost exclusively for [[rod]]s, [[staff]]s, and [[wand]]s.

==Cultural Significance==
Zalantar wood was sacred to [[Eshowdow]], the Shadow Giant from [[Chult]].<ref>

==Locations==
* [[Shaar]]
* [[Chult]]
* [[Dambrath]]: [[Great Swamp of Rethild]]

Zalantars trees grew in the rich gardens of [[Arrabar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. Notably, the gardens that surounded the mansion of the [[House Matrell]].
