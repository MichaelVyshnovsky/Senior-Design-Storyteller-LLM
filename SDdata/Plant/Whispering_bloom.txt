'''Whispering bloom''' was a species of flowering plant known for its pleasant scent.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], whispering bloom flowers were available in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. Some used [[widow's blossom]] and whispering bloom to scent [[wax]] used in flower preservations, however, adding scents affected the solution's integrity.
