Tamarind was a tree that produced edible brown-orange leguminous fruit that was consumed as a spice.
Tamarind was grown and mashed into a spice paste in the lands of Calimshan and Tashalar, which were renowned for their strongly flavored cuisine. From there, tamarind was traded, being moved through the locations on the Trade Way of Amn and Tethyr. Through trade, tamarind was available in caravan stop towns such as Mosstone.
Tamarind paste was widely available via Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue and was sold in the "Exotics" section for 100 gold coins per ounce.
Tamarind had a more or less common presence further to the south-east of Faer√ªn, where a lot of folks carried spice pouches as they traveled. Such spices included dried powdered tamarind, dried ginger, tumeric, and ground almonds, as well as raisins and rosemary.
Tamarin was a cooking ingredient used for its warm spicy flavor. For example, in Mosstone, tamarind was used to create bite-sized sugar-dusted pastry known as tamarind balls. They were available from the Drovers Last Drink tavern and loved by Volothamp Geddarm.
Tamarind was known to be used in medicine for its infection-preventing properties and especially handy against gangrene.
