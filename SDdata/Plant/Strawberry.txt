'''Strawberry''' was a common edible sweet berry plant found all over [[Faerûn]] both wild and cultivated.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-03 - Strawberries in the Realms}}

==Description==
Strawberry plant was a small plant that grew close to the ground easily noticeable for its triple leaves, tiny white flowers, and bright red berries. The berries were sweet and distinctively fragrant. The size of the berries varied depending on the region's sun, water, and soil.

==Habitats==
Places in the Realms where strawberries were known to grow included:
* The inhabitants of [[Chessenta]], [[Tethyr]], and the [[Vilhon Reach]] learned to cultivate the fruit for generations. They all used farm animal manure to reinforce their soil's nutrients, creating bigger and sweeter fruit.
* In [[Cormyr]], strawberries were known to be cultivated in [[Thunderstone]].
* The [[Katakoro Plateau]] in the [[Hordelands]].
* [[The Vast]].
* In the [[Unapproachable East]], strawberries grew throughout the nation of [[Aglarond]].

==History==
In the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], a farmer from Thunderstone named [[Del Geery]] used the dried skin of a [[hydra]] to make coverings for his [[raspberry]], [[blueberry]], and strawberry bushes. This covering kept the air around them at a cool {{SI|70|F|long=yes}}, extending their growing period deep into autumn. The hydra hides proved to be effective only on these three types of berry bush.

==Usages==
* Thanks to the sweetness of the fruit, it was often eaten raw. Among other uses, strawberries were fermented into wine, cooked into puddings, sweet [[tart]]s, and used as one of the ingredients in hearth pottages.
* It was quite common for high-end establishments in the Realms to serve a chilled strawberry soup as the second part of a full-course meal.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-10-06 - Four-course meals of the Realms}}
* During the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], two swine herders in the Vast known as [[Harkina]] and [[Swithin]] would annually plant strawberries in a cleared patch near their home at the onset of each spring. They would turn these strawberries into preserves and [[pie]]s, which they would sell for 2 and 3 [[silver piece]]s respectively.{{Cite polyhedron/91/The Living City: The Swineherd's House|14-15}}
* It was rumored that strawberry and [[raspberry]] were a part of the special recipe for [[Saerloonian Special Vat]] wine.
* Some used strawberries to make candy, such as [[Neverwintan red vein]]s.
* In inns and taverns across Faerûn, like the [[Old Skull Inn]] of [[Shadowdale]] strawberries were a common item served to the guests.<ref> Fresh strawberries and cream was a common dessert favored in [[Daggerdale]].<ref>
* Medicinally, strawberries could be used in the treatment of inflammation, swelling, or vision issues.<ref>
