        "mainbody": "'''Cassil''' was a shrub used by rich men as birth control.",
        "Description": "Cassil looked very similar to a simple [[mustard]] plant. The plant itself held little value, however, its seeds were gathered for their medicinal properties. Eating a little ground cassil seed rendered a man infertile and unable to propagate for a period of time from four to twelve days. On average, the medicine took effect within an hour. One dose of the herb cost a single [[gold]] [[coin]]. This effect was exclusive to [[humanoid]]s.",
        "Reputation": "There were many tales of rulers being dosed by their disloyal courtiers with powdered cassil in order to end their family line."
