        "Availability": "The [[Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]] were the main producers of grains such as wheat, [[barley]], and [[rye]]. The [[Dalelands]] were another verdant region of Faerûn that produced plentiful harvests of wheat and other grains. The [[Abbey of the Golden Sheaf]] in [[Mistledale]] harvested various crops grown on strict rotation. On such crop was wheat of supreme quality. Meanwhile, in the nation of [[Cormyr]], wheat was grown in the farms of [[Kirinwood]] and [[Immersea]], sold on the markets of [[Wheloon]] from the town's sizable fields, and exported from [[Ghars]].\n\nAreas of [[Tethyr]] responsible from crop production were south of the [[Sulduskoon River]] and west of [[Darromar]]. In [[Amn]], the former site of [[Myth Lharast]] was used as a wheat field in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIn the [[Vilhon Reach]], the independent city-state of [[Lheshayl]] and the small town of [[Urml]] on the [[Shining Plains]] had farms that produced wheat and rice, while in the [[Blade Kingdoms]] wheat fields were maintained by the city-state of [[Lomatra]].\n\nThe [[Great Dale]] region of the [[Unapproachable East]] was home to numerous farmers from [[Impiltur]] who cultivated hardy crops including wheat. The [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] nation of [[Thay]] used slave labor to maintain its grain fields, which included wheat. Thay also was home of at least one species of wild wheat.\n\nThe nation of [[Var the Golden]] was renowned for its flowing fields of golden wheat. The sun-kissed plains of [[Durpar]] and [[Estagund]] also housed large fields of the crop.\n\nOn the [[Moonshae Isles]], the isle of [[Snowdown]]'s farms produced grains and cattle, including wheat. Some minor wheat farming was gone on [[Norheim]] and on [[Oman]].\n\nGround wheat flour and unmilled wheat berries were sold through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' for 3 [[gold piece]]s per {{SI|1|pound|long=yes}} for flour and 2 [[gp]] per pound of wheat berries.\n\nOutside of the [[Prime Material plane]], wheat was grown and turned into baked goods on the planes of [[Bytopia]] The plane of [[Elysium]] was known for its green wheat used in making bread.",
        "Usage": "Wheat grains were used in making wheat [[flour]]. The grains were dried and ground in [[gristmill]]s using massive stone wheels or smaller [[quern]]s. Some of these stones were moved by [[horse]]s or other beasts of burden, by wind, or by water. Wheat [[bread]]s were among the most commonly baked products and a single loaf could be valued at six [[copper piece]]s.\n\n[[Saurial]]s of the [[Lost Vale]] made a strange dish out of heavily-spiced ground wheat.\n\nInhabitants of the [[High Desert]] in [[Zakhara]] used wheat flour to make [[fried battan]], fish found in the [[Al-Adib River]].\n\nWheat was used to make a wide variety of golden [[ale]]s and [[beer]]s, including [[Annasker]], [[Belbuck]], [[Darndarr]], [[Helmatoss]], [[Zeskorr]], and many others.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215540/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_040506-08.htm| title = Apr – Jun 2008| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}",
        "Ecology": "[[Wheat rust]] was a devastating, quick-spreading blight that affected crops such as wheat, [[barley]], [[rye]], [[spelt]], [[oat]]s, [[bran]], and [[timothy (plant)|timothy]] in the ancient lands of [[Netheril]]. The red [[mold]] covered their stalks and rotted the grains from the inside. In {{yearlinkConvert|3165|NY}}, the [[arcanist]] [[Candlemas]] devised a magical cure for the blight that managed to spread and halt the disease."
