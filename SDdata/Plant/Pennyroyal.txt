Pennyroyal plants were commonly used to make a herbal [[insect repellent]]. The special recipe produced [[oil]] of pennyroyal that could be rubbed on one's skin to scare hungry insects away. A single [[flask]] was sold for five [[gold]] [[coin]]s via the ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''. Each flask contained enough pennyroyal oil for fifty applications.

Pennyroyal was a key ingredient in certain ''[[potions of healing]]''.
