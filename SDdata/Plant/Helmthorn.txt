'''Helmthorn''' was a hardy, vine-like shrub.

==Description==
The helmthorn got its name from large, imposing black thorns. The thorns could grow as large as a man's hand. Its indigo berries were often harvested to be either eaten or fermented into a [[helmthorn wine]].

==Usage==
Helmthorn thorns were used as needles and dart points.

Red helmthorn berries could be sold for 1 [[sp]] each. When the spell ''[[goodberry]]'' was cast on these berries, it lasted a day longer than usual.

==Locations==
Helmthorn was common throughout [[Faerûn]].

Helmthorn brush grew dense in the [[Forest of Wyrms]]. It was also common in the [[High Thorog]] valley in the [[Nether Mountains]].
