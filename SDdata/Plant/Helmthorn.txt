Helmthorn thorns were used as needles and dart points.
Red helmthorn berries could be sold for 1 sp each. When the spell goodberry was cast on these berries, it lasted a day longer than usual.
Helmthorn was common throughout Faer√ªn.
Helmthorn brush grew dense in the Forest of Wyrms. It was also common in the High Thorog valley in the Nether Mountains.
