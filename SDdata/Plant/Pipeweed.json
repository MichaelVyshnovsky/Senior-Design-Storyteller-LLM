        "mainbody": "'''Pipeweed''' was a plant, usually smoked in pipes, that produced a feeling of calmness. In [[Airspur]], pipeweed was called '''tabac''' and was often flavored and smoked in water pipes.{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|3723}}",
        "Varieties": "* West Fennet Number Three: This left a bitter aftertaste but some users, like Farmer [[Snaggard]] of [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], had a liking for it. The tobacconist in Ghars ''circa'' [[1367 DR]] refused to stock it, so Snaggard grew a small plot of it for personal use each year on his farm.\n* Pipeweed was known to be enhanced by adding the [[thael leaf]] – a dried leaf that gave the smoke a pleasant roasted nut, [[almond]], and [[herb]]al scent and taste, lacking sweetness.{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-1-6 - Andred Kuroone, Lurandural Veltree, Jhalanavress Tanthavur, and Orstrar Galannavruk}}\n* [[Halfling]] production of pipeweed included the process of drying the leaves on roots of other plants. It infused the end-product with distinct flavors.\n* [[Maztica]]n pipeweed was known as [[tabacco]]. It had larger leaves due to warmer climate, compared to Faerûn and unlike Faerûnean pipeweed, it was sun-baked on hot rocks, giving it sharper taste. Another difference was in Maztican tobacco's burn speed and lower smoke production.{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-1-2 - Pipeweed}}",
        "Availability": "''Circa'' [[1364 DR]], a rich farm that grew pipeweed could be found to the south of [[Mosstone]], [[Tethyr]]. The farm was said to offer a good price for [[wild elf]] slaves."
