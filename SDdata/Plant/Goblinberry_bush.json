        "mainbody": "Goblinberry bushes grew on the plains surrounding the Battle of Bones in the Western Heartlands.\nThese bushes had reddish-purple berries and narrow, dark-green leaves that almost appeared black but had a silver underside.\nSour tasting, goblinberries were a potent astringent, but were so strong that, when eaten, they often caused suffocation by swelling of the throat. Because of this, they were commonly considered a poison. However, once stewed and their juice diluted with water and added to large amounts of sugar or honey, these berries made a tasty drink."
