        "mainbody": "Funguswood was a species of huge mushrooms, found almost everywhere in the Underdark and commonly used as a substitute for regular wood. Many types of funguswood were known to exist and each possessed distinct properties.\nApart from building and crafting, funguswood could be used in cooking. The fungus was ground into a fine powder and used as a spice. When added to a dish, it gave it a distinct savory mushroom accent.\nDeadly allergies to funguswood were known to exist.\nIn 1369 DR, junior chefs Marduuk and Short-Order were plotting to kill their ungrateful and overly zealous head chef, Geldorf Tinbasher, atm the gladiatorial pits in Thay that belonged to Dennaton. The duo knew of his bad allergy to funguswood and Marduuk was fully aware that even a slight taste could kill the head chef. The two asked the Champion of Baeloths Pit to procure the exotic fungus spice and add it to the chefs stew."
