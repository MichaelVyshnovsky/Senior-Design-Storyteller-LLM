        "mainbody": "'''Funguswood''' was a species of huge [[mushroom]]s, found almost everywhere in the [[Underdark]] and commonly used as a substitute for regular wood. Many types of funguswood were known to exist and each possessed distinct properties.",
        "Usage": "Apart from building and crafting, funguswood could be used in cooking. The fungus was ground into a fine powder and used as a spice. When added to a dish, it gave it a distinct savory mushroom accent.\n\nDeadly allergies to funguswood were known to exist.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], junior chefs [[Marduuk]] and [[Short-Order]] were plotting to kill their ungrateful and overly zealous head chef, [[Geldorf Tinbasher]], atm the gladiatorial pits in [[Thay]] that belonged to [[Dennaton]]. The duo knew of his bad allergy to funguswood and Marduuk was fully aware that even a slight taste could kill the head chef. The two asked the [[Champion of Baeloth's Pit]] to procure the exotic [[fungus]] spice and add it to the chef's [[stew]]."
