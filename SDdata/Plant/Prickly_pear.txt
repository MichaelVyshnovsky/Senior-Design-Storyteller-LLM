'''Prickly pear''', sometimes simply named '''cactus fruit''' [[Maztica]], and [[Zakhara]].

==Description==
The prickly pear plant was a bulbous ground-bud cactus.

==Habitats==
In the northern desert of Anauroch, prickly pear was among the most common cacti, along with [[saguaro]] species. The [[Bedine]] folk of the desert mashed the cactus flesh into a type of drinking syrup that could also be fermented into an alcoholic libation. The fruit was eaten raw with seeds mashed into a [[butter]]-like substance.

Prickly pear was also found in the [[Haunted Lands]] of Zakhara, where [[centaur]]s feasted on the fruit served with roasted [[moon snake]].

The [[Azuposi]] of Maztica who dwelt in the [[Pasocada Basin]] considered prickly pear to be a staple of their cuisine.
