Prickly pear, sometimes simply named cactus fruit Maztica, and Zakhara.
The prickly pear plant was a bulbous ground-bud cactus.
In the northern desert of Anauroch, prickly pear was among the most common cacti, along with saguaro species. The Bedine folk of the desert mashed the cactus flesh into a type of drinking syrup that could also be fermented into an alcoholic libation. The fruit was eaten raw with seeds mashed into a butter-like substance.
Prickly pear was also found in the Haunted Lands of Zakhara, where centaurs feasted on the fruit served with roasted moon snake.
The Azuposi of Maztica who dwelt in the Pasocada Basin considered prickly pear to be a staple of their cuisine.
