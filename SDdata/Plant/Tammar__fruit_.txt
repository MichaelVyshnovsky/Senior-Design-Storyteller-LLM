Tammar () was a popular citrus fruit, native to hot-climate lands of Calimshan, the Lake of Steam, and the Border Kingdoms.
Tammar was a hard, round fruit as big as an adult human fist. Unripened, tammar was pink, turning bright red as it matured. The fruits peel was hard but could easily be cut open by a sharp blade. Once the shell was penetrated, the peel could be easily removed in a spiral, one layer after another. Underneath, tammars flesh was firm pink, and chewy. The taste and juiciness of the fruit were similar to that of a tangerine. The flesh also resembled that of other citruses but had only four large segments.
Cultivated in the warm regions, tammar was often favored by merchant caravans as an easy export. Tammar fruits were easy to transport, they lasted, resisted rot and bruising, and rats aboard merchant ships did not seem to care for it. These fruits had a long gathering season that lasted from Flamerule through Marpenoth.
