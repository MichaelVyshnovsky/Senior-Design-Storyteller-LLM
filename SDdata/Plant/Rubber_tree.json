        "History": "By the mid-to-late 13{{th}} century [[DR]], heavy harvests of rubber trees had led their populations to dwindle. This led to expeditions delving into the Chultan jungles simply with the goal of finding more of them.\n\nThroughout the Amnian occupation of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in the 15{{th}} century DR, Chultan rubber trees and timbers were harvested and exported by Amnian trading companies."
