'''Spotted mushroom''' was a species of [[fungus]] used in cooking on the [[Sword Coast North]], gathered in [[Neverwinter Wood]], notable for its taste and red cap.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Jingo Rummage]], a [[halfling]] [[adventurer]], gathered forest herbs in Neverwinter Wood when his companion [[Jodri]] was eaten by wild wolf-men. As revenge, Jingo asked a group of Neverwintran adventurers to gather [[umber leaves]], spotted mushrooms, and [[spiceroot]], to add them to the wolves' cooking pots. The aroma attracted hungry [[ogre]]s to the camp, who, in turn, slaughtered the beast-men.
