'''Mergrass''' was a species of tough and tall water-loving plants.

==Description==
Mergrass was known for its hard reeds that rose hight up from the water-submerged roots. This plant was used as a building or crafting material and often sold in bundles worth fifteen [[gold]] [[coin]]s. 

==Availability==
Mergras was abundant in the [[Western Heartlands]], found on the river and lake shores.

==Usages==

Refined alchemical suspension of mergrass was the primary component in brewing a variant of the ''[[potion of mind reading]]''. Even a slightest touch of mergrass suspension to the imbiber's lips made them hear subdued bursts of sound â€“ pulses of thoughts of nearby creatures.
