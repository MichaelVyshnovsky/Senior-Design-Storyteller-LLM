        "Description": "Tabacco leaves could be smoked in pipes, similarly to pipeweed of [[Faerûn]], but it was also possible to roll them in [[cigar]]s. In all applications, tabacco was said to be far superior in flavor to pipeweed.",
        "Availability": "Sealed pots of tabacco leaves imported from Nexal were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' in the 1360s DR.\n\nImported ''balaumo'' was sold in cafes of [[Arrabar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the early 1370s DR. Namely, [[Efusio's Cafe]] offered a wide variety of fruit-infused tobacco blends, including [[cherry]], [[apricot]], [[apple]],\n\nSome flavors of tobacco enjoyed by [[wizard]]s in [[Magician's Row]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] in the late 1350s DR were Bittersage, Dragonfire, Golden Sea, Old Troll, and Saltweed.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/58/The Living City: Of Wits and Wizards, A Logic Puzzle|27}}",
        "Usages": "The spell ''[[witchweed (spell)|witchweed]]'' required the burning of tabacco as a [[material component]].",
        "Notable Users": "''Circa'' [[1367 DR]], in [[Ghars]], [[Cormyr]], tobacco was smoked by Mayor [[Tobald]] and in a pipe by [[Benelaius]]. A tobacconist in town sold both tobacco and pipeweed."
