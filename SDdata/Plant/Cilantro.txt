'''Cilantro''', also known as '''coriander''', was an exotic fragrant edible [[herb]] from the [[Haunted Lands]] of [[Zakhara]] and [[Chult]].

==Availability==
Cilantro was grown in the lush herb gardens of the [[Sarahin]] fortress in the Haunted Lands of Zakhara. The aromas of [[mint]], [[sage (herb)|sage]], [[rosemary]], [[dill]], [[parsley]], [[oregano]], [[thyme]], and cilantro all clashed with eachother, ready to be used in the fortress's nearby kitchens.

On the [[Sword Coast]] and [[Faer√ªn]], cilantro was sold via ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'', valued a [[silver]] [[coin|piece]] per ounce.

''[[Heward's handy spice pouch]]'' could magically generate various seasonings upon spoken command. Cilantro was among spices that could be summoned from the [[enchanted]] pouch.

==Usages==
In the days of ancient [[Netheril]], cilantro was used in baking [[coriander rolls]]. Another dish that used cilantro was [[Cormyr]]ean [[roast gammon pie]]. Cilantro was among spices and rubs used to flavor [[ham]] before wrapping it in generous layers of pastry.

Coriander was also used in various spice mixes used and imported from [[Port Nyanzaru]] of [[Chult]]. In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[Distant Shores]] trading company imported Chultan spice mixes into the city of [[Baldur's Gate]].

Some believed that coriander possessed medical properties to cure nausea, circulatory and respiratory diseases, as well as nervous disorders.{{Cite dragon/130/Better Living Through Alchemy|39}}

On the [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]], coriander was used as a pickling spice, together with [[mustard]] seeds, [[black peppercorn]]s, [[red chiles]], [[clove]]s, [[allspice]], [[ginger]], and [[mace (spice)|mace]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/A Gathering of Heroes Interactive}}
