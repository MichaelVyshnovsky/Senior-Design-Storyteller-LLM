        "mainbody": "Belladonna, also known as wolfsbane, that was related to horseradish.\nBeing a type of flowering plant, belladonnas produced delicate purple bell-shaped flowers and black glossy berries. Its leaves and roots contained substance called atropine. If one were to cast speak with plants on some belladonnas, the plants would typically speak to the caster about lycanthropy and werewolves.\nBelladonna were most famous for their ability to cure lycanthropy. However, they were also toxic - anyone eating them was likely to find themselves weakened physically. Consumption of their flowers was capable of inducing state of death-like sleep. Some claimed even the plants touch was toxic and required protective gloves to harvest.\nBelladonna was known to grow in parts of the High Forest, as well as on the small Isle of Balduran, in the Trackless Sea\nBeyond the Prime Material plane, belladonna could be found in both the Feywild and parts of the Domains of Dread.\nthumb|Belladonna plant from the Frozenfar region.\nIf a victim bitten by a lycanthrope ate a sprig of belladonna within an hour of the bite, they had a chance of not contracting the disease. The belladonna, however, had to be relatively fresh, not picked any later than a week ago. Beyond its use with lycanthropy, it could be used to make a sedative.\nBelladonna was used as a material component for a variety of charms, potions, spells,\n* Conceal required an ointment, made in part with a pinch of powdered monkshood.\n* Oswalds mending required belladonna leaves and roots.\n* Protection from poison required a few belladonna leaves.\n* It was also used in gas bombs invented by the lycanthrope-hunting organization known as the Silver Stake.\n* Sublimate of belladonna plant when mixed with certain types of ashes was the main component in brewing the elixir of peerless focus.\nIn the , during a full moon Ryld Argith consumed a belladonna and its three leaves from a branch he received from Yarnos grandfather after the former boy bit the drow on the wrist in his werewolf state that same evening. Belladonna prevented his first lycanthropic transformation."
