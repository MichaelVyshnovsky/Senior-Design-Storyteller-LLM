        "Description": "Being a type of flowering plant, belladonnas produced delicate purple bell-shaped flowers and black glossy berries. Its leaves and roots contained substance called [[atropine]]. If one were to cast ''[[speak with plants]]'' on some belladonnas, the plants would typically speak to the caster about [[lycanthropy]] and [[werewolves]].{{Cite organized play/LC/With Great Risks|15}}",
        "Abilities": "Belladonna were most famous for their ability to cure lycanthropy. However, they were also toxic - anyone eating them was likely to find themselves weakened physically. Consumption of their flowers was capable of inducing state of death-like sleep. Some claimed even the plant's touch was toxic and required protective gloves to harvest.",
        "Habitats": "Belladonna was known to grow in parts of the [[High Forest]], as well as on the small [[Isle of Balduran]], in the [[Trackless Sea]]\n\nBeyond the [[Prime Material plane]], belladonna could be found in both the [[Feywild]] and parts of the [[Domains of Dread]].",
        "Uses": {
            "Magic": "Belladonna was used as a [[material component]] for a variety of charms, [[potion]]s, [[spell]]s,\n* ''[[Conceal]]'' required an ointment, made in part with a pinch of powdered monkshood.<ref>\n* ''[[Oswald's mending]]'' required belladonna leaves and roots.\n* ''[[Protection from poison]]'' required a few belladonna leaves.\n* It was also used in ''[[Silver Stake gas bombs|gas bombs]]'' invented by the lycanthrope-hunting organization known as the [[Silver Stake]].{{Cite web/The Search for the Circle of Vehlarr/Part Three}}\n* Sublimate of belladonna plant when mixed with certain types of ashes was the main component in brewing the ''[[elixir of peerless focus]]''."

Belladonna prevented his first lycanthropic transformation.<ref><ref>"
