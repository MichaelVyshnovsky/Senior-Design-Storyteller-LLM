Craftspeople often used it to fashion handles for tools such as hammers, scythes, machetes, pickaxes, and even arrows. When treated with resin made from lakh insects, bronzewood could be hardened ever further and used in the crafting of weapons like daggers, axes, and swords.\nAlthough it was not native to the region, the elves of Iliyanbruen were known to use bronzewood in the creation of their musical instruments."
