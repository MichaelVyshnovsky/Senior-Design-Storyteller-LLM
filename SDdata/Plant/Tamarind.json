        "Availability": "Tamarind was grown and mashed into a spice paste in the lands of [[Calimshan]] and [[Tashalar]], which were renowned for their strongly flavored cuisine. From there, tamarind was traded, being moved through the locations on the [[Trade Way]] of [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]]. Through trade, tamarind was available in caravan stop towns such as [[Mosstone]].\n\nTamarind paste was widely available via [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] and was sold in the \"Exotics\" section for 100 [[gold]] [[coin]]s per ounce.\n\nTamarind had a more or less common presence further to the south-east of [[Faer√ªn]], where a lot of folks carried spice pouches as they traveled. Such spices included dried powdered tamarind, dried [[ginger]], [[tumeric]], and ground [[almonds]], as well as [[raisin]]s and [[rosemary]].<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-13 - Spices When Traveling}}",
        "Usages": "Tamarin was a cooking ingredient used for its warm spicy flavor. For example, in Mosstone, tamarind was used to create bite-sized [[sugar]]-dusted pastry known as [[tamarind ball]]s. They were available from the [[Drover's Last Drink]] tavern and loved by [[Volothamp Geddarm]].{{cite web| url = http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=14621&whichpage=13| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 30-04-2021| date = 30-04-2021}}\n\nTamarind was known to be used in medicine for its infection-preventing properties and especially handy against gangrene."
