        "mainbody": "emp, also known as cannabis, was a variety of plant in the Realms that was cultivated for the purpose of producing a wide variety of items. Many of these uses and means of preparing hemp were closely guarded secrets by herbalists and temples.\nThe hemp plant sported nettles.\n* This plant was known to grow in the continent of Kara-Tur, such as in the nation of Kozakura.\n* In the Island Kingdoms of Kara-Tur, hemp was grown on the island of Rukun and was one of its major exports.\n* Some wove the nettles of hemp to make a fabric of the same name, which was used for clothing and ropes. The korobokuru of Kara-Tur were one such group known for doing this.\n* Nettles were also woven and twisted together to form baskets and nets.\n* In some parts of Kara-Tur, thick layers of the fiber were used to construct shields.\n* Some used hemp for medicinal purposes as the plants could slow blood flow, clear ones head, and quell nausea.\n* Hemp had a varied effect on demihumans. It had little-to-no effect on dwarves and gnomes, no effect at all on halflings, acted as a mere painkiller for orcs, and made elves violently ill. When used by elves, it could cause cramps, vomiting, and the feeling that ones blood was on fire."
