        "Usages": "* Some wove the nettles of hemp to make a [[hemp (fabric)|fabric of the same name]], which was used for clothing and [[rope]]s. The [[korobokuru]] of Kara-Tur were one such group known for doing this.\n* Nettles were also woven and twisted together to form baskets and [[net]]s.<ref>\n* In some parts of Kara-Tur, thick layers of the fiber were used to construct [[shield]]s.\n* Some used hemp for medicinal purposes as the plants could slow blood flow, clear one's head, and quell nausea.\n* Hemp had a varied effect on [[demihuman]]s. It had little-to-no effect on [[dwarves]] and [[gnome]]s, no effect at all on [[halfling]]s, acted as a mere painkiller for [[orc]]s, and made [[elves]] violently ill. When used by elves, it could cause cramps, vomiting, and the feeling that one's blood was on fire."
