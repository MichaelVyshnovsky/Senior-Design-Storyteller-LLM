'''Papaya''' was a fruit cultivated as food. One might expect to find it served either as a side dish or as a [[tea]] at inns in tropical regions.{{Cite dragon/418/Inns in an Instant|43}}

Places in the Realms where papaya were known to be cultivated included:
* In the [[Chultan Peninsula]], papaya were grown in orchards around [[Guthland]] and in [[Chult]] by the [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi tribe]] in agricultural groves near [[Mezro]].
* In the land of [[Luiren]], papaya were particularly known to grow in the tropical fruit plantations that stood between the cities of [[Beluir]] and [[Chethel]].
* On the continent of [[Kara-Tur]], papaya could be found on the [[Malatran Plateau]]<ref>{{Cite web/RPGA Living Jungle/Jungle Tales 17}} and in remote parts of [[Shou Lung]], where fresh papaya was eaten as part of feasts. The [[Laska]] of [[Kilap Valley]] would give gifts of papaya as a peace offering.
