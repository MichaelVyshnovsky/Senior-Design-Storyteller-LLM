They were cooked, often served with fish koko-yams, and palm wine, or cooked into a sauce.\nPlantain trees could be found growing within the gardens of Generon - the palace of the Lord of Arrabar.\nPlantains grew in the jungles of Chult where they were a part of Tabaxi diet. In the Agricultural Quarter of Mezro, the tabaxi tribesfolk cultivated plantains, along with many other sources of food for the city.\nOn the islands of Jazirat al-Qraidis in the Crowded Sea, plantains were a common sight as well as were objects of trade for the locals. Thick forests of plantain trees granted the city of Sams Bandar one of its major export goods. Plantains were also widely available for the semi-nomadic halflings of the Tarangu, Jazayir al-Alfar. Plantains also were offered monthly to Karrrga, the great crab god."
