        "mainbody": "Bay, also known as hotleaves, was a type of flowering plant on Toril. Its leaves were commonly used as a flavoring agent in cooking and traded together with other spices.\nBay trees were native to the warmer climate areas of Toril, which made them a valuable commodity in the areas of cold climates, such as Icewind Dale. Bay leaves were often one of the commodities filling the wagons of trading caravans moving from Luskan to Ten Towns.\nBeyond Toril, bay trees could be found on the Rock of Bral in the Elven Forest.\nDue to the bay leaves rich savory and herbal flavors, they often were used in cooking, both dry and fresh. One of the well-known simple and hearty dishes made with bay leaves was a simple fowl soup.\nBacchae and the priests of Pan often wore garlands made from laurel leaves.\n* One of the lesser known holy symbols of Apollo was a wreath of laurel leaves."
