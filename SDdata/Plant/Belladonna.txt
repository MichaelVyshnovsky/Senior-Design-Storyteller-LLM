{{otheruses4|the plant|other uses|Nightshade (disambiguation)}}
'''Belladonna''', also known as '''wolfsbane''',{{Cite dungeon/67/Witches' Brew|9}} that was related to [[horseradish]].

{{quote|''If you fear the changer moon<br/>If befall'd by curse or doom<br/>If you're in the lycan's power<br/>Seek the belladonna flower.''|An old rhyme.}}

==Description==
Being a type of flowering plant, belladonnas produced delicate purple bell-shaped flowers and black glossy berries. Its leaves and roots contained substance called [[atropine]]. If one were to cast ''[[speak with plants]]'' on some belladonnas, the plants would typically speak to the caster about [[lycanthropy]] and [[werewolves]].{{Cite organized play/LC/With Great Risks|15}}

==Abilities==
Belladonna were most famous for their ability to cure lycanthropy. However, they were also toxic - anyone eating them was likely to find themselves weakened physically. Consumption of their flowers was capable of inducing state of death-like sleep. Some claimed even the plant's touch was toxic and required protective gloves to harvest.

==Habitats==
Belladonna was known to grow in parts of the [[High Forest]], as well as on the small [[Isle of Balduran]], in the [[Trackless Sea]]

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], belladonna could be found in both the [[Feywild]] and parts of the [[Domains of Dread]].

==Uses==
[[File:Belladonna iwd2.png|thumb|''Belladonna plant from the [[Frozenfar]] region.'']]
If a victim bitten by a lycanthrope ate a sprig of belladonna within an hour of the bite, they had a chance of not contracting the disease. The belladonna, however, had to be relatively fresh, not picked any later than a week ago.{{Cite dragon/266/Dragon's Bestiary: Giant Lycanthropes}} Beyond its use with lycanthropy, it could be used to make a sedative.
===Magic===
Belladonna was used as a [[material component]] for a variety of charms, [[potion]]s, [[spell]]s,
* ''[[Conceal]]'' required an ointment, made in part with a pinch of powdered monkshood.<ref>
* ''[[Oswald's mending]]'' required belladonna leaves and roots.
* ''[[Protection from poison]]'' required a few belladonna leaves.
* It was also used in ''[[Silver Stake gas bombs|gas bombs]]'' invented by the lycanthrope-hunting organization known as the [[Silver Stake]].{{Cite web/The Search for the Circle of Vehlarr/Part Three}}
* Sublimate of belladonna plant when mixed with certain types of ashes was the main component in brewing the ''[[elixir of peerless focus]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, during a full moon [[Ryld Argith]] consumed a belladonna and its three leaves from a branch he received from [[Yarno|Yarno's]] grandfather after the former boy bit the [[drow]] on the wrist in his werewolf state that same evening. Belladonna prevented his first lycanthropic transformation.<ref><ref>
