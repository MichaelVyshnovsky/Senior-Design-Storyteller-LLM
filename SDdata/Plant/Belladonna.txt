Belladonna, also known as wolfsbane, that was related to horseradish.
Being a type of flowering plant, belladonnas produced delicate purple bell-shaped flowers and black glossy berries. Its leaves and roots contained substance called atropine. If one were to cast speak with plants on some belladonnas, the plants would typically speak to the caster about lycanthropy and werewolves.
Belladonna were most famous for their ability to cure lycanthropy. However, they were also toxic - anyone eating them was likely to find themselves weakened physically. Consumption of their flowers was capable of inducing state of death-like sleep. Some claimed even the plants touch was toxic and required protective gloves to harvest.
Belladonna was known to grow in parts of the High Forest, as well as on the small Isle of Balduran, in the Trackless Sea
Beyond the Prime Material plane, belladonna could be found in both the Feywild and parts of the Domains of Dread.
