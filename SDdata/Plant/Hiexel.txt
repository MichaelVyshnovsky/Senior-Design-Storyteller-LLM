Hiexel was a type of tree found in Faerûn.
Hiexel trees usually grew about 30 feet tall. They had sparse branches that curved to make an overall oval shape. They had silver-green bark. The wood itself was green.
Hiexel produced a great quantity of smoke when burned, so it was useful in cooking and signal fires. Hiexel bark was used in bookbinding and as a sealant in buildings. The wood was unstable and so was not useful in construction or crafting.
