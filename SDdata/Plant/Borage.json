        "Usages": "* These plants could be used medicinally to treat coughs and various lung infections.\n* These plants were a common form of seasoning in the Realms.\n* All [[illithid]]s had an allergy to borage. Like other vegetation that illithids had known allergies for, borage could cause nausea, a strong desire to withdraw from others, and if consumed in large quantities could induce debilitatingly painful internal cramps and convulsions."
