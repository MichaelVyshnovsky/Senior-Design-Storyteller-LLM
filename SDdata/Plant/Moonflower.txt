'''Moonflower''', also known as '''blueshine,''' was a species of beautiful flowering plant which was cultivated in [[Evereska]] and [[Silverymoon]], and grew wild in the [[Dessarin Valley]].

==Description==
Moonflowers were tiny white cup-shaped flowers that looked somewhat similar to [[tulip]]s. Each flower was surrounded by four triangular green leaves that glowed blue in moonlight while the flower itself glowed white.

Moonflowers found in Silverymoon could glow during any time of the day thanks to a simple ''[[cantrip]]'' invented by the city's [[wizard]]s.

In the Dessarin Valley, wild blueshine grew alongside the [[snowdrift]] plant that was similar to [[clover]]. Moonflowers of the [[High Dale]] were rare and grew atop deep snow, attracting [[Sembian]] [[alchemist]]s on a monthly basis.

==History==
[[Erlevaun Dathnyar]], a [[moon elf]] of Evereska, had a beautiful small garden bathed in gentle moonflower glow. He died in his garden in [[1348 DR]], murdered by [[Horaundoon]] of the [[Zhentarim]].
