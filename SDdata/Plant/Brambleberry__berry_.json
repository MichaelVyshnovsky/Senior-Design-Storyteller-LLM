        "Description": "As a [[Wikipedia:bramble|bramble]], these bushes had thorns and rambled like a vine. Their berries were large and glossy black.",
        "Availability": "Brambleberry bushes could be found growing in the following locales:\n* [[Maskyr's Eye]] in [[the Vast]], where the farmers cultivated them.\n* [[Eshpurta]] in [[Amn]], around the fields south of the city, including near one of [[Maldiglas Turntower]]'s secret [[refuge]]s.<ref>{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|73-74}}",
        "Culinary": "The berries were edible, with a tart taste.\n\nBrambleberry jam was among the dishes into which [[butter]]ed [[biscuit]]s could be dipped at [[The Wemic Comes to Westbridge]], an inn in the village of [[Westbridge]] in the [[Savage Frontier]].<ref>\n\nBrambleberry jelly was sweet and enjoyed as a dessert, such as in the sweet [[tart]]s served at [[The Wizard's Hand]] inn in Maskyr's Eye or spread on thin-sliced and toasted [[hardbread]] by the farmfolk of the vale.\n\nHowever, brambleberry [[wine]] could be either exquisite or, more often than not, utterly undrinkable. Hence, it was only rarely brewed. Nevertheless, brambleberry—presumably just the good stuff—was also served at The Wizard's Hand.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|24}}"
