        "mainbody": "Brambleberry was a type of berry-bearing bush grown in Faerûn for its fruit.\nAs a bramble, these bushes had thorns and rambled like a vine. Their berries were large and glossy black.\nBrambleberry bushes could be found growing in the following locales\n* Maskyrs Eye in the Vast, where the farmers cultivated them.\n* Eshpurta in Amn, around the fields south of the city, including near one of Maldiglas Turntowers secret refuges.\nThe berries were edible, with a tart taste.\nBrambleberry jam was among the dishes into which buttered biscuits could be dipped at The Wemic Comes to Westbridge, an inn in the village of Westbridge in the Savage Frontier.\nBrambleberry jelly was sweet and enjoyed as a dessert, such as in the sweet tarts served at The Wizards Hand inn in Maskyrs Eye or spread on thin-sliced and toasted hardbread by the farmfolk of the vale.\nHowever, brambleberry wine could be either exquisite or, more often than not, utterly undrinkable. Hence, it was only rarely brewed. Nevertheless, brambleberry—presumably just the good stuff—was also served at The Wizards Hand."
