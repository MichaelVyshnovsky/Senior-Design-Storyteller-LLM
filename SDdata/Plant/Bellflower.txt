'''Bellflowers''' were plants cultivated in [[Elf|elven]] communities. They were known for their scent and melodic sounds, but also served as a beautiful alarm system.
{{Quote|Tone deaf, as are all gray elves.|An elitist [[sun elf]] [[Fenian Ni'Tessine|assassin]], thinking the [[moon elf]] guards failed to notice the bellflower alarm.}}

==Description==
Bellflowers chimed with a faint musical tinkling in the wind. They had different melodies according to the wind's direction and intensity.

==Habitats==
Bellflowers could be found in [[Evermeet]], especially in the gardens around [[Moonstone Palace]], as well as in other elven settlements.

==Usage==
Bellflower gardens were designed to catch the slightest breeze, making the plants tinkle constantly. Any intruders passing through the area created a disruption in the air flow, thus altering the melody. The change could go unnoticed by the intruders, but be as alarming as a trumpet to the heightened senses of elven guards.
