Bellflowers were plants cultivated in elven communities. They were known for their scent and melodic sounds, but also served as a beautiful alarm system.
Bellflowers chimed with a faint musical tinkling in the wind. They had different melodies according to the winds direction and intensity.
Bellflowers could be found in Evermeet, especially in the gardens around Moonstone Palace, as well as in other elven settlements.
Bellflower gardens were designed to catch the slightest breeze, making the plants tinkle constantly. Any intruders passing through the area created a disruption in the air flow, thus altering the melody. The change could go unnoticed by the intruders, but be as alarming as a trumpet to the heightened senses of elven guards.
