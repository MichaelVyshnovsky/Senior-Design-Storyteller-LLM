Zucchinis, otherwise known as marrows, were a type of green gourd vegetable that grew in the Realms.
Zucchinis were believed to be especially delicious when slowly baked in open fire, smothered in Amnian herbs.
Places in the Realms where marrows were known to be produced included
* The region of Cormyr, particularly in the farming village of Bogbrook,
* The Hordelands, in the halfling realm of Delmyr.
* The Western Heartlands, particularly in the village of Anga Vled.
* The town of Gaj produced marrows among other vegetables that made up the staples of the towns cuisine.
* Zucchini were grown and eaten by the Ancients of the Malatran Plateau. The vegetables from that region were long and thin spears. In the late 14 century DR, the tribes rediscovered the vegetable and found an ancient recipe for Zucchini Saiyama style.
