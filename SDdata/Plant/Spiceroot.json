        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Jingo Rummage]], a [[halfling]] [[adventurer]], gathered forest herbs in Neverwinter Wood when his companion [[Jodri]] was eaten by wild wolf-men. As revenge, Jingo asked a group of Neverwintan adventurers to gather [[umber leaves]], [[spotted mushroom]]s, and spiceroots to add them to the wolves' cooking pots. The aroma attracted hungry [[ogre]]s to the camp, who, in turn, slaughtered the beast-men."
