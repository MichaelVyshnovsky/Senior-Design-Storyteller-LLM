        "mainbody": "piceroot was a root used in cooking on the Sword Coast North. It was gathered in Neverwinter Wood and was notable for its spicy taste.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Jingo Rummage, a halfling adventurer, gathered forest herbs in Neverwinter Wood when his companion Jodri was eaten by wild wolf-men. As revenge, Jingo asked a group of Neverwintan adventurers to gather umber leaves, spotted mushrooms, and spiceroots to add them to the wolves cooking pots. The aroma attracted hungry ogres to the camp, who, in turn, slaughtered the beast-men."
