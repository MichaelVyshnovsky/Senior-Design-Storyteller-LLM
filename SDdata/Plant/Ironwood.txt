'''Ironwood''' was a type of deciduous [[tree]] that preferred temperate wet climates. It had famously tough non-magical wood often used for construction of armor, weapons, and fortifications.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190916000019/http://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_070809-05.htm| title = So Saith Ed (Jul-Sep 2005)| accessdate = 26-12-2021| date = 26-12-2021}}

==Description==
Ironwood was very durable and light. It weighed significantly less than [[oak]] wood.

==Availability==
Ironwood trees grew in abundance along with other temperate climate trees in [[Cormanthor]].

To the south from [[Rauvin]], ironwood trees could be found among many deciduous species of hardwoods that grew there.

The inhabitants of [[Yarrat]] in [[Zakhara]] used ironwood trees to provide shade for their homes, which were dug into pits under the trees' protection.

Ironwood trees could be found in the [[Grey Jungle]] in Zakhara. The local inhabitants used them to create reinforcements for their homes, containers, and woodcarvings.

The [[Djinni's Claws]] islands had lush vegetation that included ironwood trees along with more exotic plants.

According to [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s research, ironwood trees could be found across many ''[[crystal sphere]]s'' beyond [[Realmspace]].

Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], ironwood trees could be found in [[Svartalfheim]]. The inhabitants of that realm valued ironwood carvings and used it to craft their ''[[staff of the magi|staves of the magi]]''.

==Usage==
* ''[[Ashek Kuldell]]'' was a unique magical [[axe]] of [[dwarf|dwarven]] make, with a shaft carved out of ironwood and the head  forged out of the remains of an unknown [[god]] found in the [[Astral Plane]].{{Cite dragon/245/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Dwarven Relics|43}}
*The ''[[beastskin]]'' armor enchantment, which allowed it to remain worn and adjusted to the wearer's ''[[wild shape]]'' transformations, required the use of ironwood.
* [[Hand drum]]s were created out of solid ironwood, [[ash]], or [[cherry]] trees. They could be purchased from [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]] for 20 [[gp]] a piece.
* [[Mirabar]]'s city gates—Northgate, Eastgate, River Gate, and Sunset Gate—were reinforced by ironwood barricades, enchanted to withstand fire.
* A ''[[pearly okimono of the sea dragon]]'' was an enchanted item kept by marine vessels as both a boon and a sign of prestige. Ironwood was required for the item's creation.
* [[Shadowdale]]'s [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] had ironwood doors on the prison cells.
* [[Shield]]s crafted out of ironwood could be found throughout the [[Sword Coast]] area. They came as [[buckler]]s, medium shields, and [[tower shield]]s. These shields were powerful for a non-magical item; their most notable feature, apart from durability, was their light weight.
* A [[table dice]] game set included a solid board of ironwood and cost 5 gp through Aurora's.
* The ''[[Veladar's vambrace]]'' spell required a chunk of ironwood as its [[material component]].
* ''[[Wand of fireballs|Wands of fireballs]]'' were made out of ironwood and topped with a small flaming globe.
* ''[[Wand of hold person|Wands of hold person]]'' were made out of delicate ironwood twigs.
* [[Waterdeep]] held a lot of items made out of ironwood. Notably, a beautiful heavy polished ironwood bar with a carved footrail could be found in the [[Beer Golem Tavern]].
* [[Weapon]]s such as the ''[[gladiator's club]]'', enchanted ironwood [[dire mace]]s, and [[Uthgardt]] ceremonial [[two-bladed sword]]s all were created using ironwood.

===Trivia===
* [[Teak serpent]]s' preferred habitats were forests of ironwood. Their constricting cols were also stronger than ironwood.
