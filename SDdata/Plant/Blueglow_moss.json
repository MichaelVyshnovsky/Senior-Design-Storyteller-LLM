        "mainbody": "'''''Blueglow moss''''' was a unique species of magical [[moss]] found growing within and in very close proximity to the ''[[mythal]]'' surrounding the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "Description": "''Blueglow moss'' was created by Myth Drannor's powerful ''mythal'' magic that granted it potent healing abilities and quick growth. ''Blueglow moss'' could be easily spotted at night when it glowed with blue ''[[faerie fire]]''.\n\nThe moss could not survive outside of the ''mythal's'' magic and could not be created without the spells that were used to create the ''mythal'' of Myth Drannor.\n\n''Blueglow moss'' was fairly common among the ruins of Myth Drannor, namely it could be found in the [[Shrine of Mystra]], and in the [[Glim-Gardens]], [[Speculum Grounds]], and many other locations across the city.",
        "Use": "Any creature that decided to rest on the bed of ''blueglow moss'' received magical healing from it; the longer the rest was, the more healing was provided.\n\nIf the creature was to spend six or more hours resting on the bed of this moss, the magic plant gifted the creature with the following effects: ''[[remove disease]]'', an ability to use ''[[darkvision]]'' at will, the power to ''[[levitate]]'' (after the first six hours of rest, the ability could only work if the creature was naked, the effect increased with longer rest, allowing the ''levitation'' carry higher weights), the ability to ''[[detect poison]]'' at will, increased resistance to ''petrification'', and the ability to use the ''[[regenerate]]'' spell (but only after a cumulative twelve hours of rest). All these effects disappeared once the creature left the ''[[mythal]]''.\n\nWhen a handful of the ''blueglow moss'' was consumed, it acted as a ''[[cure light wounds]]'' spell, but only within one minute after harvesting.\n\n''Blueglow moss'' could be distilled into a potent ''[[potion of healing]]'' of a uniquely blue color. Although, just like the moss itself, it likely lost its magic when taken outside of the ''mythal'' that spawned it.",
        "History": "In [[1369 DR]], ''blueglow moss'' that grew within the ''mythal'' was affected by the magical corruption of it by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] via the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' that surfaced in the ruins. With the alteration of ''mythal'', ''blueglow moss'' started wilting, losing its healing powers, and dying. The moss returned to health after the ''mythal'' was restored by the [[Veiled Ones]] and [[Anorrweyn Evensong]] the same year."
