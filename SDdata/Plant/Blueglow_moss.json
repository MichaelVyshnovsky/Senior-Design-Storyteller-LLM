        "mainbody": "lueglow moss was a unique species of magical moss found growing within and in very close proximity to the mythal surrounding the ruins of Myth Drannor.\nBlueglow moss was created by Myth Drannors powerful mythal magic that granted it potent healing abilities and quick growth. Blueglow moss could be easily spotted at night when it glowed with blue faerie fire.\nThe moss could not survive outside of the mythals magic and could not be created without the spells that were used to create the mythal of Myth Drannor.\nBlueglow moss was fairly common among the ruins of Myth Drannor, namely it could be found in the Shrine of Mystra, and in the Glim-Gardens, Speculum Grounds, and many other locations across the city.\nAny creature that decided to rest on the bed of blueglow moss received magical healing from it the longer the rest was, the more healing was provided.\nIf the creature was to spend six or more hours resting on the bed of this moss, the magic plant gifted the creature with the following effects remove disease, an ability to use darkvision at will, the power to levitate (after the first six hours of rest, the ability could only work if the creature was naked, the effect increased with longer rest, allowing the levitation carry higher weights), the ability to detect poison at will, increased resistance to petrification, and the ability to use the regenerate spell (but only after a cumulative twelve hours of rest). All these effects disappeared once the creature left the mythal.\nWhen a handful of the blueglow moss was consumed, it acted as a cure light wounds spell, but only within one minute after harvesting.\nBlueglow moss could be distilled into a potent potion of healing of a uniquely blue color. Although, just like the moss itself, it likely lost its magic when taken outside of the mythal that spawned it.\nIn 1369 DR, blueglow moss that grew within the mythal was affected by the magical corruption of it by the Cult of the Dragon via the pool of radiance that surfaced in the ruins. With the alteration of mythal, blueglow moss started wilting, losing its healing powers, and dying. The moss returned to health after the mythal was restored by the Veiled Ones and Anorrweyn Evensong the same year."
