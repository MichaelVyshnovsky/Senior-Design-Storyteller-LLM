Bayberry was a variety of evergreen shrub in the Realms that bore a fruit of the same name.

A bushel of bayberries could yield about  of a pleasant-smelling, green wax. which were used in the practice of druidic candle magic. During the winter solstice, on the Sel√ªnite holiday of Alban Arthan, many in the city of Ravens Bluff would light such candles during the day and leave them burning until they went out.
