Mothersleaf, also written as mothersleaf, was the name of a plant found in the Savage Frontier. Considered a herb, it was noted for its curative properties.
When its leaves (fresh or dried, powdered, and properly preserved) were boiled in a tea, it could cure a natural disease almost a third of the time. When drunk prior to the casting of cure disease, it guaranteed the curing of mummy rot. Although some tried to apply powdered mothersleaf directly to an infected wound caused by a mummy, this would not stop the rot.
Although rare, it was found in many temperate and subarctic climes in the north, such as the Savage Frontier.
