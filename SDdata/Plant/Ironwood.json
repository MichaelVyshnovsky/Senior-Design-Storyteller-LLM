        "mainbody": "'''Ironwood''' was a type of deciduous [[tree]] that preferred temperate wet climates. It had famously tough non-magical wood often used for construction of armor, weapons, and fortifications.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190916000019/http://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_070809-05.htm| title = So Saith Ed (Jul-Sep 2005)| accessdate = 26-12-2021| date = 26-12-2021}}",
        "Description": "Ironwood was very durable and light. It weighed significantly less than [[oak]] wood.",
        "Availability": "Ironwood trees grew in abundance along with other temperate climate trees in [[Cormanthor]].\n\nTo the south from [[Rauvin]], ironwood trees could be found among many deciduous species of hardwoods that grew there.\n\nThe inhabitants of [[Yarrat]] in [[Zakhara]] used ironwood trees to provide shade for their homes, which were dug into pits under the trees' protection.\n\nIronwood trees could be found in the [[Grey Jungle]] in Zakhara. The local inhabitants used them to create reinforcements for their homes, containers, and woodcarvings.\n\nThe [[Djinni's Claws]] islands had lush vegetation that included ironwood trees along with more exotic plants.\n\nAccording to [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s research, ironwood trees could be found across many ''[[crystal sphere]]s'' beyond [[Realmspace]].\n\nOutside of the [[Prime Material plane]], ironwood trees could be found in [[Svartalfheim]]. The inhabitants of that realm valued ironwood carvings and used it to craft their ''[[staff of the magi|staves of the magi]]''.",
