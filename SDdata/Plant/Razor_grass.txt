'''Razor grass''' was a special type of grass that could be found in small scattered areas throughout [[Pelleor's Prairie]] surrounding the [[Hill of Lost Souls]].

As the name implied, razor grass was incredibly sharp, and could easily cut passing animals or unarmored [[humanoid]]s. The only distinguishable feature of this grass was that its blades appeared slightly silver compared to regular green grass. Razor grass was not carnivorous but was often found near the [[squid jail plant]], which was a carnivorous plant.
