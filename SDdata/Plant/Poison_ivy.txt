Poison ivy was a species of plant in Faerûn that was considered poisonous to handle without protection.
* In northwest Faerûn, poison ivy could be found in the Neverwinter Wood.
* Poison ivy leaves were used as a material component to cast irritation.
* Wererats had a deadly allergy to poison ivy. Because of this, powdered ivy was used by the lycanthrope-hunting organization the Silver Stake in some of their gas bombs alongside powdered silver.
