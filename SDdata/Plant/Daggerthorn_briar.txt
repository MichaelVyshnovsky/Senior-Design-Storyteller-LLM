'''Daggerthorn briar''' was a mundane species of thorny plant that was hard to maneuver through and colorfully described by some as being "bloodthirsty". Because of its hazardous nature, some cruel nobles would plant daggerthorn around their villa grounds as protection.

==Habitats==
This species of plant grew in deep woods and parts of the [[Feywild]], such as the area known as [[Spiderwood]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/Lost Love|12}}

==History==
Following the [[Spellplague]], the inhabitants of the city of [[New Sharandar]] grew daggerthorn briars on their defensive wall, the Living Abatis.
