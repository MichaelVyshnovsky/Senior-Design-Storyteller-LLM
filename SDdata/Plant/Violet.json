They would avoid entering homes that were surrounded by beds of them, avoid touching those who carried bouquets of them, and those who carried bouquets were also unaffected by their spells.\n* Violets were a favored plant of the deities Lliira and Loviatar, with the latter preferring dark violets in particular."
