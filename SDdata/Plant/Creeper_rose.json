        "mainbody": "Creeper roses were common in the Rose Garden of the Battle of Bones.\nCreeper roses were vigorous plants with pink flowers. They climbed at will and attached to anything in their path.  At the Rose Garden, the vines would wrap around bones and scattered weapons, creating a sturdy horizontal framework for the rest of the garden and giving it a macabre appearance.\nWhen picked, these flowers did not last long unless kept in warm water with a bit of sugar added.  Flowers blooming under these conditions gave off a powerful scent."
