* West Fennet Number Three This left a bitter aftertaste but some users, like Farmer Snaggard of Ghars, Cormyr, had a liking for it. The tobacconist in Ghars circa 1367 DR refused to stock it, so Snaggard grew a small plot of it for personal use each year on his farm.
* Pipeweed was known to be enhanced by adding the thael leaf – a dried leaf that gave the smoke a pleasant roasted nut, almond, and herbal scent and taste, lacking sweetness.

* Maztican pipeweed was known as tabacco. It had larger leaves due to warmer climate, compared to Faerûn and unlike Faerûnean pipeweed, it was sun-baked on hot rocks, giving it sharper taste. Another difference was in Maztican tobaccos burn speed and lower smoke production.
Circa 1364 DR, a rich farm that grew pipeweed could be found to the south of Mosstone, Tethyr. The farm was said to offer a good price for wild elf slaves.
