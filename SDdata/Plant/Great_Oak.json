        "mainbody": "'''The Great Oak''' was a magical tree that existed in [[Kuldahar]]. It was the reason that Kuldahar was in a state of eternal summer and had no trace of snow, unlike the surrounding areas. When linked with the [[Heartstone Gem]], it could radiate a large circle of warmth.",
        "History": "Thousands of years before, the great oak was once a divine seed. On the plateau near the tree stood a [[yuan-ti]] outpost. The yuan-ti took interest in the spot which the Great Oak grew, as it was the gateway to a distant land.\n\nWhen Kuldahar was invaded in the early 14{{th}} century, the tree was repeatedly hacked by the brutal yuan-ti. They managed to destroy several of the Great Oak's roots. The archdruid [[Iselore]] stayed to protect it.\n\nThe yuan-ti managed to find a crossroad [[portal]], from one of the tree's severed roots, to [[Chult]]. They planned to use this portal to send through troops and assault Kuldahar. This plan never came to fruition, as the yuan-ti forces were either wiped out at their temple in Chult, or their crossroad guardian was destroyed."
