'''Marlikkon''' was a fruit-bearing thorny bush found in abundance in the [[Heartlands]] of [[Faer√ªn]], in the vicinity of [[Starmantle]] and to the southwest of [[Evereska]].

==Description==
Marlikkon was a wild bush, not cultivated but commonly gathered and consumed by [[humanoid]]s. The fruit was easily identifiable for its thorny hard outer shell, similar to that of [[chestnut]]s. They were brown in color and had easily opened, irregularly seamed shells. Marlikkon's citrus flesh was shaped in purplish-gray translucent ovals. The fruit was acidic and sweet, reminiscent of [[tangerine]].

Once shelled, the fruit withered and dried out swiftly, usually within just a couple of days. However, if left whole, the shell preserved the fruit for a very long time. Oftentimes, unshelled marlikkon was stored in sacks or [[barrel]]s in food cellars, lasting for over a year.

==Usages==
Marlikkon was usually eaten raw. The fruit was piled in a dish and served with a nutcracker or a wood mallet to open the hard shells.

The outer shell could be boiled to create a mahogany-colored dye, while the needles from the fruit could be used as crude sewing needles. The prickly shell was also used decoratively in various fanciful ornate desserts fit for nobility.
