            "Usage": "Iticala sap was a natural secretion of the iticala trees. It was a thick and oily viscous substance with a strong scent. The sap was harmless and served as a food source for tiny [[flies]] as well as large [[leaf spider]]s. The sap left grease on the fingers of those who touched it and could serve as a high-quality [[lantern oil]].\n\n[[Saru]]—[[ape]]-like [[humanoids]] of the [[Living Jungle]]—knew of the sap's flammable properties and used it to devastate the breeding grounds of [[luroki]], a disease-spreading insect.{{Cite living jungle/Plague|17}}\n\nIticala sap could also be used to create healing [[iticala curing jelly]].{{Cite living jungle/Plague|30}}"
