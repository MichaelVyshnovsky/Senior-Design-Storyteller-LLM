        "mainbody": "ildroot was a variety of flora that could be found in the jungles of Chult. It was known to have medicinal properties.\nWildroots could be found growing in groups of up to six.\nThe juices of a wildroot could neutralize poisons and infections when introduced to the bloodstream. Usually, this was accomplished by rubbing the root directly into an open wound. Each root contained sufficient juice to clean one injury.\nThe druid Arvo of Ravens Bluff noted the curative properties of wildroot in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nWildroots were grown in the gardens of Nangalore and could be found in Omu.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, a whole wildroot sold for 25 gold pieces in Chult."
