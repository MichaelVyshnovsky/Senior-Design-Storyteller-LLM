        "Powers": "Halrath fruits, or more precise, berries, were edible but terribly bitter. There existed two varieties: green and red fruits. When the green fruit was consumed, it allowed for conversing with the animal life of the [[Living Jungle]] as if under the effects of the ''[[speak with animals]]'' [[spell]] for five minutes. Red fruits did the same but as through the ''[[speak with plants]]'' spell.\n\nOnce the fruit was harvested, it lasted for only about two nights. After that, the fruit dried out and lost its magic."
