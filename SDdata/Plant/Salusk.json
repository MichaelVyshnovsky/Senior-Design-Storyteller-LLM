        "mainbody": "'''Salusk''' was a species of [[human]] head-sized [[melon]]s that grew on creeping spindly vines all over [[Faerûn]].",
        "Description": "The fruit was oblong in shape with two bumps or \"horns\" on its opposite sides. Salusk fruit's sweet and succulent flesh was beige and tasted reminiscent of a [[pear]] when it reached ripeness. As they matured, their skin turned from pale to [[emerald]] green. Unripe salusk had thick and [[oil]]y skin with a tough and bitter-acidic taste. If left unharvested, the fruit eventually turned brown, oversoft, and sour. Its skin turned maroon and ripped, attracting swarms of hungry [[wasp]]s and [[hornet]]s.",
        "Usages": "Unripened salusk could be cooked in oil. The fruit's flesh absorbed the flavor of anything it was fried in, often making it a substitute or addition to meat products if fried in [[animal fat]]. The fruit's tough leathery rind was rich in fiber and edible, yet held no flavor.",
        "Availability": "Salusk grew abundantly throughout Faerûn, reaching as far south as [[Calimshan]]. Cultivated salusk was planted along long fences the vines could cling to and it was fertilized with cattle [[dung]]. Because of the fruit's tough rind and resistance to bruising, salusk was easy to transport, keep, and trade. Even unrefrigerated and exposed to sun, salusk fruit could keep for two [[tenday]]s."
