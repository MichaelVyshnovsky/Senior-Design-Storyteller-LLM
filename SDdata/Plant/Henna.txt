'''Henna''' was a southern plant that was most commonly used to produce red [[dye]], which was used in body decoration and textiles.

==Usages==
Actors of [[Westgate]] used henna to dye their hair red for performances, namely those portraying [[Alias]] of the Azure Bonds in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

In the nation of [[Calimshan]], henna dye was used to color fingernails by some, while others used it to dye the hands of their slaves, a practice that dated back to the [[Calim Empire]].

Similarly, [[ghul]]s of [[Zakhara]] dyed the tips of their fingers with red henna, indicating subservience. [[Zakharan]] women sometimes decorated their brows with dots of henna, while desert nomad women ([[Al-Badia]]ns) were known to dye their hands, feet, and even hair with henna. In the case of the latter, Al-Badians used "[[water of the camel]]" to lighten their hair and accentuate later applications of henna hair dye. The [[hin]] of Zakhara enjoyed henna treatment for their foot hair. And in [[Qudra]], City of Power, henna was used to regularly dye the [[sandstone]] walls of the [[Mosque of Blood]].

The [[Bedine]] folk of the great desert of [[Anauroch]] used henna juice and other dyes to color their [[khreima]]s,{{Cite digital book/The Parched Sea||14}} and women used it to decorate their hands and cheeks.

===Magic===
A drop of henna was a [[material component]] that could be used to cast the ''[[eagle's splendor]]'' [[spell]].{{Cite dragon/282/Countdown to the Forgotten Realms: Magic of Faerûn|24}}
