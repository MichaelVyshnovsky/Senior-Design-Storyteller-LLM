The sacs and their secretions were refined into a vitriol that possessed a peculiar effect on those who smelled it. This vitriol had a smell of cloying sweetness but provoked bile rising in one's throat. The same smell seemingly sharpened the senses of those who smelled it.\n\nShadowroot vitriol could be combined with certain types of ashes to brew ''[[elixirs of viciousness]]''."
