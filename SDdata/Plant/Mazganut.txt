'''Mazganut''' was a species of large vine tree found growing in the southern [[mage]] city of [[Khaerbaal]] in [[Halruaa]].

==Habitats==
Mazganut trees were similar in size to the [[bilboa]] trees, found growing around Khaerbaal and within its many parks. The huge tree was shrouded in vines and was big enough to offer shelter to many creatures, including [[human]]s. The size of the tree allowed it to have a rich miniature biome of creatures dwelling on the tree's branches, holes, and trunk.
