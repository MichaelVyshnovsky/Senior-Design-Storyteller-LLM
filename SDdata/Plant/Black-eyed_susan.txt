'''Black-eyed susans''' were a type of a flower in the Realms that could be found growing in the [[Moonsea North]] and [[the Vast]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Scavenger Hunt|3-4}}

==Description==
These flowers were brightly colored and bore some resemblance to the blooms found on an [[echinacea]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/269/Extra Healing|45}}

==History==
Around the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a shop in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] known as [[Flora's Flower Shop]] carried black-eyed susans. They were kept outside the shop in a bucket, underneath a sign written in [[Common]] inviting customers to "Hep yoreselfs to a free flowa." At the time the flowers sold by [[Flora (Ravenian)|Flora]] served as badges of official entry whilst in the hidden market of [[Flask Circle]]. If she couldn't convince a visitor to purchase one her flowers she would insist they take and wear one of the black-eyed susans offered outside, as lacking a flower whilst in Flask Circle would signify that an individual had snuck into the hidden market.
