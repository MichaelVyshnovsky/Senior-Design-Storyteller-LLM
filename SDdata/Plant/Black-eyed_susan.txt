Black-eyed susans were a type of a flower in the Realms that could be found growing in the Moonsea North and the Vast.
These flowers were brightly colored and bore some resemblance to the blooms found on an echinacea.
Around the late 14 century DR, a shop in the city of Ravens Bluff known as Floras Flower Shop carried black-eyed susans. They were kept outside the shop in a bucket, underneath a sign written in Common inviting customers to "Hep yoreselfs to a free flowa." At the time the flowers sold by Flora served as badges of official entry whilst in the hidden market of Flask Circle. If she couldnt convince a visitor to purchase one her flowers she would insist they take and wear one of the black-eyed susans offered outside, as lacking a flower whilst in Flask Circle would signify that an individual had snuck into the hidden market.
