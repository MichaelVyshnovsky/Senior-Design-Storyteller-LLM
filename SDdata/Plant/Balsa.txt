Balsa trees were a species of fast-growing trees with light-weight soft wood.
Beyond the world of Toril, Balsa wood was used to build light spelljammer ships called Locust, originally developed in Wa with the aid of Cormyrean wizard.
Enchanted quarterstaves of Myth Drannor, the spellstaves, were as sturdy as the hardest oak, but were made out of light balsa wood.
