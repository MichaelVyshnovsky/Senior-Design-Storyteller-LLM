        "mainbody": "'''Weir''' trees, also known as '''weirwoods''', were rare trees in [[Faerûn]].",
        "Description": "Weir trees resembled [[oak]]s and could grow huge in their later years. The most remarkable feature of the weir tree was its leaves: they were silvery brown on the top and velvety black on the bottom.",
        "Abilities": "Any weirwood item brought into a magically-lit area would continue to glow for some time after leaving that area.",
        "Habitats": "Weir trees were found mainly far into large, old forests. \n\n* In [[northwest Faerûn]], weir trees were found in [[Ardeep Forest]]{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|4}} and the [[High Forest]].\n* In the [[Unapproachable East]], weir trees could be found throughout [[Aglarond]]. Their presence was thought by some to be evidence of ancient [[elf|elven]] inhabitation of the region.",
        "Usages": "* The wood of this tree was not naturally flammable, making it excellent for construction purposes. Living trees were more fire resistant than harvested wood, however. \n* The wood of this tree was often used for making musical instruments, especially [[lute]]s, [[harp]]s, [[birdpipes]], and [[longhorn]]s, because of its lovely sound.\n* [[Alustriel Silverhand]] created no more than 12 staves out of weirwood that were known as ''[[lesser staff of Silverymoon|lesser staves of Silverymoon]]''.\n* In the High Forest, the [[gold dragon]] [[Aerosclughpalar]] used weir trees to disguise his true treasure.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 7}}\n* Weirwood could be used to craft a ''[[thyrsus of the druid]]''.",
        "Trivia": "* Most weir trees were protected by protectors of the forest, such as [[dryad]]s, [[treant]]s, [[ranger]]s, or [[druid]]s. Those found throughout Aglarond were often protected by dryads or other species of [[fey]]."
