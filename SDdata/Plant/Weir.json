        "mainbody": "Weir trees, also known as weirwoods, were rare trees in Faerûn.\nWeir trees resembled oaks and could grow huge in their later years. The most remarkable feature of the weir tree was its leaves they were silvery brown on the top and velvety black on the bottom.\nAny weirwood item brought into a magically-lit area would continue to glow for some time after leaving that area.\nWeir trees were found mainly far into large, old forests. \n* In northwest Faerûn, weir trees were found in Ardeep Forest and the High Forest.\n* In the Unapproachable East, weir trees could be found throughout Aglarond. Their presence was thought by some to be evidence of ancient elven inhabitation of the region.\n* The wood of this tree was not naturally flammable, making it excellent for construction purposes. Living trees were more fire resistant than harvested wood, however. \n* The wood of this tree was often used for making musical instruments, especially lutes, harps, birdpipes, and longhorns, because of its lovely sound.\n* Alustriel Silverhand created no more than 12 staves out of weirwood that were known as lesser staves of Silverymoon.\n* In the High Forest, the gold dragon Aerosclughpalar used weir trees to disguise his true treasure.\n* Weirwood could be used to craft a thyrsus of the druid.\n* Most weir trees were protected by protectors of the forest, such as dryads, treants, rangers, or druids. Those found throughout Aglarond were often protected by dryads or other species of fey."
