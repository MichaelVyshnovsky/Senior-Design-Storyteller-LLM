A '''Gulthias tree''' was a plant infused with supernatural evil, capable of spreading corruption to nearby plant life and generating malevolent creatures known as [[blight]]s. A Gulthias tree could originate wherever a plant was contaminated by an evil force or sentience.

==Powers==
A Gulthias tree left unchecked could infect the surrounding forest and cause blights to emerge from nearby corrupted plant life. The tree and its associated blights could turn a lush forest into a toxic, bramble-filled wasteland, growing with supernatural speed to overwhelm nearby roadways and settlements.

==History==
According to legend, the first Gulthias tree sprouted from the [[stake]] used to slay the [[vampire]] [[Gulthias]] of Nightfang Spire, head of the cult of the [[red dragon]] [[Ashardalon]]. The stake destroyed Gulthias, but the vampire's latent magic caused the stake to sprout, growing into a sapling infused with vampiric power. A [[druid]] was said to have later discovered the sapling and transplanted it inside an underground grotto, where the druid nurtured the tree until it produced the first seeds from which blights were generated.

==Notable Gulthias Trees==
Around [[1490 DR]], [[Grannoc]], a [[half-orc]] anchorite of [[Talos]], cultivated a Gulthias tree within a ruined manor in [[Neverwinter Wood]], northwest of [[Conyberry]].

Around [[1492 DR]], a Gulthias tree appeared along the banks of the [[Stojanow River]] outside of [[Valjevo Castle]] in [[Phlan]], causing the magical thicket around the castle to spill into the streets of Old Phlan and generating malevolent blights.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|20-22}}
