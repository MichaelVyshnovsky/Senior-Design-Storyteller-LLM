Fireblossoms were a species of flowering plants that blossomed in the summer and were a major part of summer festival of the sun celebrating Sune Firehair, in northwest Faer√ªn.
By the late 15 century DR, summer Sunite festival was a common celebration during which many competitions took place, including fireblossom-gathering competitions. The flowers were then exchanged for gifts and used to decorate the festival grounds. The rewards were summer foods like fresh tomatos, squashes, and sunmelons.
