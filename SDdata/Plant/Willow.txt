The '''willow''' was a type of tree found in [[Faerûn]].

==Habitats==
* In the forest of [[Cormanthor]], willow trees with droopy branches grew on hillsides of the [[Rimwood]].
* In [[interior Faerûn]], willows grew throughout the lowlands of the [[Cormyr]] countryside,<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/Cormyr Countryside}} as well as the [[Vast Swamp]].
* In the [[Unapproachable East]], willows were common across the interior uplands of [[Aglarond]], especially near the rivers and marshlands of the [[Yuirwood]]. Particular areas within the Yuirwood where willows stood included [[Halendos]] and the [[Sunglade]].
* [[Eastern Farmlands]] outside of [[Daggerford]].
*Noble houses of [[Arrabar]] kept lush green gardens and used copious flower planters as decorations throughout their homes. Miniature willow trees were among the many plants that grew inside lush mansions, namely, inside [[House Pharaboldi]].
===Beyond the Prime Material===
* In [[Pluton]], a layer of the [[Gray Waste]], there were blackened willows that stood in a perpetual state of gradual death.<ref>

==Varieties==
The '''weeping willow''' was a variety of willow with long drooping branches. They were also found in the Vast Swamp, such as around the [[Skull Staff]].

The sturdy '''gray willow''' was found in the [[Farsea Marshes]]. Its bark was used by the [[Marsh Drover]]s to make an effective bug repellent.

Silver willow trees decorated with silver filigree grew in a grove in [[Verenestra]]'s bower in the [[Seelie Court (divine realm)|Seelie Court]].<ref>
