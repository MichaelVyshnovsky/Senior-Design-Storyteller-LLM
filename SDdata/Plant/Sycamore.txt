'''Sycamores''' were a type of tree that could be found in the Realms.<ref group="note">The existence of sycamore trees in the Realms is questionable because of a conflicting statement in the footnotes on page 59 of ''[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]'', a newer publication than ''Spellbound''. It states that "alder, boxwood, the plane tree, redwood, and sycamore" are absent from the Realms.

==Description==
Sycamore trees had very distinct Y-shaped seed pods that playfully whirled and spiraled through the air, carried by theory leaf-blades. The seeds were released by the sycamore trees in late summer and early fall.

==Habitats==
* A grove of sycamores stood around the [[Starmeadow Tower]] following the [[Time of Troubles]].
* In the [[Unapproachable East]], sycamores were common around the rivers and marshlands of the [[Yuirwood]].
* Sycamore trees grew within the city-state of [[Sumbria]] of the [[Blade Kingdoms]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]].
