Ash wheat was a species of wild wheat found in the Duskwood of the  Border Kingdoms.
Ash wheats lifecycle affected the cycles of other animal species in the region. Ash wheat grew in abundance every spring, providing a generous food source for the badger mice population and swelling their numbers. The growing population of badger mice led to abundant food for puff adders, increasing the snake population.
