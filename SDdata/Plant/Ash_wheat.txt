'''Ash wheat''' was a species of wild [[wheat]] found in the [[Duskwood]] of the  [[Border Kingdoms]].

==Ecology==
Ash wheat's lifecycle affected the cycles of other animal species in the region. Ash wheat grew in abundance every spring, providing a generous food source for the [[badger mice]] population and swelling their numbers. The growing population of badger mice led to abundant food for [[puff adder]]s, increasing the [[snake]] population.
