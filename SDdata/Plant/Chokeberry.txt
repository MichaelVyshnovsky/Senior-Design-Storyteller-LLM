Chokeberry was a type of edible berry found growing on chokeberry shrubs.
Wild chokeberry shrubs could be found alongside honeysuckle growing all along the Black Plain of Sembia. The shrubbery was quite common, spreading over Sembian hills and valleys and serving as shelter for creatures like wild chickens and deer.
