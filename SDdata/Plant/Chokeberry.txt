'''Chokeberry''' was a type of edible berry found growing on chokeberry shrubs.

==Availability==
Wild chokeberry shrubs could be found alongside [[honeysuckle]] growing all along the [[Black Plain]] of [[Sembia]]. The shrubbery was quite common, spreading over Sembian hills and valleys and serving as shelter for creatures like wild [[chicken]]s and [[deer]].
