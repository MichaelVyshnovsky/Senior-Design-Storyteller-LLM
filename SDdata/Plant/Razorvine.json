        "mainbody": "Razorvine, often called \"the kudzu of the Outer Planes\",\nIts small, serrated, heart-shaped leaves were so dark that were often considered black, usually growing on short sprigs near the plants triangular stem. The leaves themselves were harmless, but the stems had elevated ridges that ran along the edges that were extremely hard and sharp.\nThe plant itself was not intelligent or aggressive, and could not move. The danger of the razorvine was in trying to handle it, brushing past it, or falling into it. The deep cuts caused by the stems could easily kill an unprotected creature who fell into a patch just by struggling to get free. Remaining motionless could prevent some of the damage. Armor and magic items such as a ring of protection or a cloak of protection provided some defense from the razorvine, but spells and items that misdirected an attacker, such as blur, bracers of defense, or boots of striding and springing did not help at all.\nEach individual razorvine plant consisted of between two and twenty vines that grew in patches  long. Even after killing all vines, the plant grew back after just a few days, unless the central root system was destroyed.\nDried razorvine patches occasionally formed balls that could be blown by the wind.\nVery few natural creatures were capable of eating razorvine, but the weed was known to be eaten by the voracious quills, porcupine-like creatures native to the Outer Planes. It was also greatly enjoyed by fhorges, creatures similar to boar that roamed the Outlands, Acheron, and the Nine Hells.\nIn Sigil, part of the duties of the dabus included pruning the razorvines around the city. The previous days growth was cut, dried, and then sold as firewood.\n* Despite the dangers of handling it, razorvine was very easy to grow and relatively easy to train. With a few prunings, it could easily cover a wall or seal off an entrance. For that reason, it was very popular as an effective way to keep intruders out of private places.\n* In its raw state, razorvine was inedible by humanoids. However, the Cilenei brothers, two elven wizards from Curst, knew a technique to safely ferment razorvine leaves. They grew them in vineyards in the city and used them to make a drink known as heartwine. They also made the drink from freshly cut razorvine brought by visitors. The recipe was a secret known only by the two brothers, but it was suspected that it involved some sort of magical procedure.\n* The vines did not burn well and were very resistant to fire. However, once dried, the stems lost their edge and the plant became very brittle, providing good firewood and kindling. \n* Dried and oiled vines could also be used to make rope that was as dangerous to handle as a living vine, and made for particularly cruel bindings, as well as whips.\n* The sap from these plants, when hardened and properly prepared, could be used to make items that were conducive to enchantment with powerful spells of protection.\nThe exact origin of razorvine was unknown, but it was speculated that the plant had been first brought to Sigil from some jungle in the Abyss.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the Emerald Enclave sent adventurers to investigate reports of razorvine growing in the Marsh of Chelimber. The vines had infested the Island of Brutes, a large island located within the marsh.\nIt was rumored that a visitor to Ribcage was killed and quartered for trying to smuggle razorvine cuttings into the city, shortly after it was cleared of a previous razorvine infestation.\nThe razor-sharp grass that grew on the plains of Cathrys was thought by some to be a lesser version of razorvine.\nRazorvine was a favored plant of the deity Deep Duerra."
