'''Balsam''', also referred to as '''jewelweed''', was a group of flowering plants that blossomed in high elevations, often shedding their colorful petals to be carried by wind for miles.

==Availability==
Balsam was known to grow in the higher areas of the [[Western Heartlands]], where it was used by locals as a curative herb and to prepare [[balsam ointment]]s.

Balsam was also known to grow in the colder areas of the [[Moonsea]] region. Local sages thought that the presence of [[fern|fiddlehead fern]]s, jewelweed, and [[jimsonweed]] was a sign of unnatural magic, especially when found not in their natural habitat.

===Uses===
Balsam ointment was used to clean wounds. Partially burned balsam leaves had a sweet and smoky fragrance. They were ground into ash and combined with special [[salt]]s to stabilize the mix and brew it into ''[[potions of greater healing]]''.
