        "mainbody": "ivewood was a rare variety of magical tree that was found on the world of Eberron.\nThese trees were quite hardy and had a green coloration to their bark. Most notably, felling a livewood tree would not \"kill\" it, just stop it from growing any further.\nIn the late 15 century DR, adventurers in the Icewind Dale area occasionally came across bowls full of sap from a livewood tree. They proceeded to use this sap to create maple rot draught, a special alchemical concoction, at the request of Groundskeeper Seble.The lack of information provided in Neverwinter Storm Kings Thunder on the crafting material \"livewood sap\" makes it unclear if it was meant by the developers to be a reference to the Eberron tree of the same name or just a generic term. This article leans towards the former, but it is mere speculation."
