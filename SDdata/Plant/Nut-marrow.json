        "Description": "Nut-marrows were akin to other marrows like the courgette and [[zucchini]], but on the inside, they were beige. The taste of their insides was like roast [[almond]]s.",
        "Usage": "These plants were grown by many as a food source. They rotted far more slowly than zucchini, and so were easily stored as winter food. They could be fried in thin slices, or in many other ways, such as making [[lubbath]] with diced and cooked nut-marrows.",
        "History": "[[Mirt]] sold two warehouses' full of nut-marrows to [[Thaglon]] late in {{YearlinkName|1357}}, getting fine [[steel]]-and-[[silver]] [[Amn]]-work for it.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|24|1}}"
