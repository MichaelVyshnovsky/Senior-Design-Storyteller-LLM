        "mainbody": "'''Cloudberries''' were a species of [[raspberry]] endemic to the [[High Moor]] region.",
        "Description": "Much like other raspberry species, the fruits of the cloudberry bush grew on long, [[whip]]-like and wiry branches that were known as canes. But unlike the standard raspberry, these fruits had a yellowish hue.\n\nMuch like the [[bilberry]] bush, their canes tended to form dense, interwoven thickets that made it challenging to retrieve these berries.",
        "Usage": "Said to be very palatable, cloudberries were a staple in the diet of many animals that inhabited the High Moor plateau, with even [[human]]s and [[goblinkin]] known to forage for them."
