        "mainbody": "loudberries were a species of raspberry endemic to the High Moor region.\nMuch like other raspberry species, the fruits of the cloudberry bush grew on long, whip-like and wiry branches that were known as canes. But unlike the standard raspberry, these fruits had a yellowish hue.\nMuch like the bilberry bush, their canes tended to form dense, interwoven thickets that made it challenging to retrieve these berries.\nSaid to be very palatable, cloudberries were a staple in the diet of many animals that inhabited the High Moor plateau, with even humans and goblinkin known to forage for them."
