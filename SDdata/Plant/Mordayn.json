        "Uses": "When a poultice of mordayn was steeped in boiling water, it produced a distinct mist with hallucinogenic properties. This vapor was known as [[dreammist]], a [[drug]] that was highly sought after and extremely addictive.\n\nMordayn tea was a lethal [[poison]]. Similarly, ingesting the herb in its raw form, or ground into powder, also proved to be quite deadly."
