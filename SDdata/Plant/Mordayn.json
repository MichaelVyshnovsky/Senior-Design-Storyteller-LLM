        "mainbody": "Mordayn was a scarcely-located herb that grew in the southern forests of Faer√ªn.\nWhen a poultice of mordayn was steeped in boiling water, it produced a distinct mist with hallucinogenic properties. This vapor was known as dreammist, a drug that was highly sought after and extremely addictive.\nMordayn tea was a lethal poison. Similarly, ingesting the herb in its raw form, or ground into powder, also proved to be quite deadly."
