        "mainbody": "Darkberry was a type of berry bush found in forests around the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nThey grew in clumps hidden deep in the forests. Darkberry bushes produced small purple berries, only a few of which ripened each fall, and they were growing rarer every year by 1372 DR. Ripe darkberries contained shadowstuff when split or crushed, they released a circle of blackness 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide, large enough to hide a humanoid, for a dozen seconds.\nA single darkberry cost 5 gp.\nFRSombrebaie\nCategoryFruits\nCategoryShrubs\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryItems\nCategoryBerries\nan8azwm6re5wmnwu9e0er3jzmj33zlx"
