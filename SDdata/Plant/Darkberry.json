        "mainbody": "'''Darkberry''' was a type of berry bush found in forests around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].\n\nThey grew in clumps hidden deep in the forests. Darkberry bushes produced small purple berries, only a few of which ripened each fall, and they were growing rarer every year by [[1372 DR]]. Ripe darkberries contained [[shadowstuff]]; when split or crushed, they released a circle of blackness 5 feet (1.5 meters) wide, large enough to hide a [[humanoid]], for a dozen seconds.\n\nA single darkberry cost 5 [[gp]].",
