'''Powderpuff''' was a small white flower with bluish leaves that grew in the polar regions of [[Anadia]].

==Description==
Powderpuff was a triple-stemmed plant with small bluish-green leaves. The flowers were white and small and highly poisonous. Any bruise caused the flowers to secrete a potent [[poison]] that could penetrate the skin and leave a creature in a catatonic state for ten days.

==Usage==
The flowers could be dried and powdered to produce an explosive substance akin to ''[[smokepowder]]'', but only about half as potent.
