==Description==
[[File:Carrionette rvlft.png|thumb|213px|''A [[knife]]-wielding [[carrionette]] slices an apple, revealing the seeds inside.'']]
Apples could be eaten raw, but they also had several other uses. They were mainly used for making [[cider]] (and [[wine]]), but also used as sauce,{{Cite web/The Border Kingdoms/Beldargan}} and to fill pies. Due to their several uses, many settlements over [[Toril]] harvested apples.

;Apples of Youth: Golden, magical apples that grew from the '''Tree of Youth''' in Asgard, which was watched over by the goddess Idun.<ref group="note" name="Youth">[[Deities & Demigods 1st edition|''Deities & Demigods'']] and [[Legends & Lore (2nd edition)|''Legends & Lore'']] both state that these apples would reverse 10 years of age, with the latter book stating they were eaten every ten years. However, ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]'' does not state how much age they reverse and instead says they were eaten every spring. As the former two are Core sourcebooks, the latter is given precedence.

Apples and their products were enjoyed by many mortals, but also by the gods. [[Nathair Sgiathach]], a member of the [[Seelie Court]], loved to eat apple pies, but was incredibly picky about how they were made.

In [[the North]], [[Sword Coast]], and [[Western Heartlands]] it was common to find [[sealing wax|wax]]-sealed jars of apple jams and jellies inside of cupboards.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/Fruits in the Realms}}

The [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]] in [[Aru]], Wa, had a soaring apple tree in front of it that was sacred to [[Bishamon]]. The fruit were said to bestow immortality upon those who were worthy, and death to the wicked, but only Bishamon could pick them. In the town, peddlers sold model [[ceramic]] and tiny [[brass]] apple souvenirs to [[pilgrim]]s. [[The Apple Tree Inn]] was likely named for the tree.
