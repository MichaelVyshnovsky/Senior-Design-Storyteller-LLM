        "Description": "Blossoms of the ylang plant gave off a distinct and sickeningly sweet odor.",
        "Uses": "Although the process was known to only a few, ylang blossoms could be pressed into an oil, that could be used to formulate a potent and permanent variety of ''[[love potion]]''. The trick to this use was in the oil's potency, which was ensured by picking blossoms in the morning, rather than later in the day.\n\nRegardless of its potency, ylang oil could also be used to create a variety of balms and [[tea]]s.",
        "History": "{{Quote|A dead dragon—a [[dracolich]]—wishes the love of a [[half-elf]]?|[[Ruha]], astounded by the plot unfolding before her.}}\nDuring the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], Minister [[Hsieh Han Liu]] of the [[Ginger Palace]] dealt in ylang blossoms, importing them to the [[Eastern Heartlands]] from Shou Lung via his ship, the ''[[Ginger Lady]]''.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, the dracolich [[Hethcypressarvil]] schemed to use oil made from the ylang blossoms imported to the Ginger Palace to creature a ''love potion'' that would force [[Yanseldara]] of [[Elversult]] to love him."
