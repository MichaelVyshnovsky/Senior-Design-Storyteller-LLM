            "Religion": "* Mistletoe was considered holy to most druids. They typically felt that the proper way to harvest this plant was with a [[sickle]] made of either [[silver]] or [[gold]] and catching it in a bowl before it touched the ground. Not harvesting in this manner was believed to reduce the potency of mistletoe.\n* Whenever worshipers of [[Silvanus]] performed a vigil they would anoint themselves with a powder made of crushed mistletoe leaves and acorns, mixed with water from either rain or a spring."
