        "mainbody": ", High Dale\nMoonflower, also known as blueshine, was a species of beautiful flowering plant which was cultivated in Evereska and Silverymoon, and grew wild in the Dessarin Valley.\nMoonflowers were tiny white cup-shaped flowers that looked somewhat similar to tulips. Each flower was surrounded by four triangular green leaves that glowed blue in moonlight while the flower itself glowed white.\nMoonflowers found in Silverymoon could glow during any time of the day thanks to a simple cantrip invented by the citys wizards.\nIn the Dessarin Valley, wild blueshine grew alongside the snowdrift plant that was similar to clover. Moonflowers of the High Dale were rare and grew atop deep snow, attracting Sembian alchemists on a monthly basis.\nErlevaun Dathnyar, a moon elf of Evereska, had a beautiful small garden bathed in gentle moonflower glow. He died in his garden in 1348 DR, murdered by Horaundoon of the Zhentarim."
