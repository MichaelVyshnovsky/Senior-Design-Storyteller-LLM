        "Cosmography": "[[File:Yggdrasil2Hades.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''Yggdrasil's planar connections.'']]\nYggdrasil was so massive that it could almost be considered a plane in its own right. It even had certain planar characteristics of its own, such as a mild affinity towards [[chaos]] and a mild enhancement of plant- and [[:Category:Chaotic spells|chaotic]]-related [[spells]].\n\nThe tree's roots were in [[Niflheim]] (the second layer of [[Hades]]), and its crown was in [[Ysgard (layer)|Ysgard]] (the homonymous first layer of [[Ysgard]]) as described by the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] model. Other roots and branches penetrated the Prime planes where Norse [[deities]] were recognized, allowing travelers to climb the tree until they reached a portal very similar to a ''[[color pool]]'' and step through to their destination.\n\nThe entry point into Niflheim was usually a favorite among travelers because it avoided the first layer of [[Oinos]], a frequent battleground of the [[Blood War]].\n\nAt the other end of Yggdrasil was the first layer of the plane of Ysgard, the home of the rest of the Norse pantheon. Ysgard contained many realms including [[Jotunheim]], [[Alfheim]], [[Vanaheim]], and the grand realm that gave the layer its name, [[Asgard]]. The tree also extended its branches to the second layer, [[Muspelheim]]. All of these divine domains were near (in a cosmic sense) to the World Ash for easy access but often required a trek of hundreds or thousands of miles/kilometers to reach the tree.\n\nOnce on Yggdrasil, it was said that a trip from the Prime to either Asgard or Niflheim took at least 100 days, but there was no record of any mortal ever successfully completing the journey.{{Cite dragon/90/Plane Facts on Gladsheim|37}} On the other hand, trips between Outer Planes rarely took longer than a week. In both cases, those trips were not without risks, either from the tree's inhabitants, from the risk of falling into the Astral Plane as a result of losing contact with the tree's branches, or from simply walking into the wrong destination by mistake. Falling from Yggdrasil into lower locations was rarely fatal, but could cause substantial damage as a falling creature tumbled through branches.\n\nThe tree touched all layers of the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] and [[Elysium]], except [[Belierin]], since all portals leading in and out that layer had been sealed. The reasons why Yggdrasil connected with the Beastlands were unclear, since no Norse deities claimed realms in that plane. It was speculated that the wilderness and life-giving properties of the plane were sufficient to root the tree there.\n\n[[File:Yggdrasil_map-3e.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''A representation of Yggdrasil showing some of its connections and distances.'']]\nOther branches of Yggdrasil connected to the vicinity of [[Glorium]] and the realm of the [[Norns]] in the [[Outlands]] and to [[Winter's Hall]] in [[Pandemonium]]. The tree also extended a branch into [[Arvandor]] in the [[Arvandor (layer)|first layer]] of Arborea, near a village known as [[the Gnarl]]. A branch also extended to [[Limbo]], connecting to a relatively stable forested island known as [[Pinwheel]].\n\nRelatively easy to find connections along the branches included [[Sigil]], the [[Shadowfell]], and the [[Iron Wastes]], the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 23: The Iron Wastes|23{{rd}} layer]] of the [[Abyss]]. In addition to those, Yggdrasil was connected to every Outer Plane, including [[Mount Celestia]], [[Mechanus]], and even the [[Styx]], but ''portals'' to those locations were few and much more difficult to find.\n\nThe exact exit point of most ''portals'' was impossible to predict, since currents from the Astral Plane often shifted the position of the branches, causing the tree to bend as if swaying under the wind.\n\nIf a traveler died while on Yggdrasil, their soul was claimed by [[valkyrie]]s. In such cases, ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'' magic only worked if granted by a Norse [[deity]].",
        "Inhabitants": "The entry point into Niflheim was guarded by [[Nidhogg]], a creature that was sometimes described as a gargantuan, very ancient [[red dragon]], and other times as a serpent. The World Ash and the dragon were perpetually in conflict as Nidhogg tried to sever the inter-planar link to Ysgard by chewing through the roots in order to feed her countless children. Yggdrasil responded by putting down new roots as fast as the dragon could eat them. The dragon usually ignored travelers coming up and down the roots, but fiercely defended herself and her offspring if disturbed.\n\n[[Viper tree]]s and [[linnorm]]s were said to be the bastard offspring of Nidhogg. Both infested some of the thinner and lower branches of the tree. Viper trees were also commonly found in [[Azzagrat]], but some specimens were brought to [[Thay]] by [[Red Wizard]]s.\n\n[[File:Ratatosk-3e.jpg|thumb|250px|''A ratatosk inhabitant of Yggdrasil.'' ]]\nSome of the most important inhabitants of Yggdrasil were the [[ratatosk]]s, humanoid-looking giant flying squirrels who worked as messengers or guides between the planes touched by the tree. In order to hire them for any service, a bribe in the form of pods from Yggdrasil itself was typically acceptable. The ratatosk frequently delivered threats from the dragons in Niflheim to other inhabitants of the tree, which included giant [[stag]]s that grazed on the leaves and [[giant eagle]]s that nested on the branches.\n\nThe branches of Yggdrasil were also inhabited by numerous tree-dwelling creatures, such as [[abrian]]s, birds of prey, [[darkweaver]]s, [[giant raven]]s, and [[spider]]s. [[Angel]]s guarded the ''portals'' located in some of the upper branches and [[yugoloth]]s guarded some of the ones in lower branches. A few [[hag]]s were known to inhabit cottages along the lower branches.\n\nThe most frequently encountered travelers along Yggdrasil included [[bariaur]]s, [[Ysgardian dwarves]] and [[elves]], [[Fire giant|fire]] and [[frost giant]]s, [[giant owl]]s, valkyries, and [[winter wolf|winter wolves]].",
        "History": "A branch of Yggdrasil was a preferred trajectory of the [[Great Modron March]] as it moved from Ysgard to Limbo.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The [[Athar (faction)|Athar]] maintained that the Norse pantheon drew its power from Yggdrasil itself. Legends also claimed that the day when Nidhogg finally managed to completely destroy the tree's roots would bring about the end of Yggdrasil and of the Norse pantheon.\n\nThe Ratatosk considered Yggdrasil itself to be their patron [[deity]] and viewed the tree as a feminine entity."
