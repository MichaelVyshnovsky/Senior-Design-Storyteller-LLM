        "History": "Crystal roses were beautiful crystalline plants. Their rarity and beauty made them highly sought after symbols of status and wealth. Acquiring the rose was extremely dangerous due to the location they grew in. In [[1370 DR]], [[Asborn Moonstar]], a love-sick young nobleman from [[Waterdeep]] perished during the expedition for the legendary flower. He was trapped in the garden chamber by its [[drow]] residents, leaving him to starve to death. Subsequently, one rose was taken from the garden and returned to the noble youth's grieving fianc√©, [[Elene Ruldegost]], as a token of her dead lover's affections."
