Long beans were a variety of legume indigenous to Maztica and widely consumed there for food.
These green beans grew in tender pods and had a sweet and crisp flavor when eaten fresh. Pickled long beans were also popular as winter food. They were consumed by both rich and poor Mazticans.
Long beans could also be dried in order to survive long trips. Pickled and dried long beans imported from Maztica were available for purchase through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue.
