'''Long beans''' were a variety of legume indigenous to [[Maztica]] and widely consumed there for food.

==Description==
These green beans grew in tender pods and had a sweet and crisp flavor when eaten fresh. Pickled long beans were also popular as winter food. They were consumed by both rich and poor [[Maztican]]s.

Long beans could also be dried in order to survive long trips. [[Pickle]]d and dried long beans imported from Maztica were available for purchase through ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]''.
