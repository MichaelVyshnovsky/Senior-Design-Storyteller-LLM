Patchouli was a species of aromatic flowering plant found in the jungles of the Malatran Plateau and several other regions.
* Death Becomes Her Beauty, a shop in the town of Spiderhaven in Undermountain that sold suspiciously sourced scented soaps, including soaps made with patchouli flowers.
* Patchouli was among goods transported across the Hordelands.
* The Simbara people of the Valley of the Lion on the Malatran Plateau gathered such aromatic plants as rose, vanilla, and patchouli to be used in creating of soaps and oils. These substances were used in the tribal bathhouses and in ceremonial religious cleansing before standing in front of the Simbara deityâ€”Vizerathu, the spirit of the Lion.
Dried patchouli was sold as an aromatic substance by the Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue. It was listed in the Priests Alcove section of the catalogue and was sold at two ounces for a single silver coin. The same catalogue offered exotic scented oils, including patchouli lamp oil, and scented patchouli beeswax.
