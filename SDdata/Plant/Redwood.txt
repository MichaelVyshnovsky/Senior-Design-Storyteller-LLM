'''Redwoods''' were a species of [[tree]]s found in several locations across the [[Realms]], known for their sturdiness and massive size.

{{quote|''I would have picked a better spot. There are only [[birch]]es and scrub trees around here. Give me a good [[oak]] or redwood grove any day.''|[[Andoralson]] of the [[Moonsea]]}}

==Habitats==
* Redwoods grew in the [[High Forest]] and were used by [[elvish]] craftsmen to carve impressive furniture out of, including thrones.
* The [[Forest of Wyrms]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] had a population of majestic massive redwood trees that reached several hundreds feet tall and to feet wide.
* [[Cormyr]]'s [[Helmlands]] had the [[Redwoods]] forest that perished during the [[Spellplague]], but in the century that followed a new generation of redwood trees grew to maturity in place of their perished progenitors.{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Spellplague: The Wailing Years}}
* [[Hartsvale]], the land of [[giant]]s and giant trees, exported quality redwood that was used to fashion fashion masts and keels by shipbuilders of [[Westgate]].

==Usages==
* [[Orc]]s and [[tanarukk]]a that served [[Daggerford]]'s [[Devil]] [[Gorgomorz]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, were supplied with orcish-made redwood [[shield]]s. {{SI|127|lb|k|long=yes}} each, they lacked in appearance but were very effective nevertheless.
* Redwood was used in construction of doors in [[Tethyr]]. Redwood doors were in use even in the royal palace of Tethyr in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
* Redwood furniture was in use in the land of [[Zakhara]]. A huge table of carved redwood could be found in the Ivory Tower of [[Dar al-Bayda]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/63/Blood and Fire|51}}
