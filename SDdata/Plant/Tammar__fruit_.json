        "Description": "Tammar was a hard, round fruit as big as an adult [[human]] fist. Unripened, tammar was pink, turning bright red as it matured. The fruit's peel was hard but could easily be cut open by a sharp blade. Once the shell was penetrated, the peel could be easily removed in a spiral, one layer after another. Underneath, tammar's flesh was firm pink, and chewy. The taste and juiciness of the fruit were similar to that of a [[tangerine]]. The flesh also resembled that of other citruses but had only four large segments.",
        "Availability": "Cultivated in the warm regions, tammar was often favored by merchant caravans as an easy export. Tammar fruits were easy to transport, they lasted, resisted rot and bruising, and [[rat]]s aboard merchant ships did not seem to care for it. These fruits had a long gathering season that lasted from [[Flamerule]] through [[Marpenoth]]."
