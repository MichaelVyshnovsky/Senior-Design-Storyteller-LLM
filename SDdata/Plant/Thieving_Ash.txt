The '''Thieving Ash''' was a supernatural [[tree]] grown by the [[Rotting Man]], a servant of [[Talona]], in the late 14{{th}} century DR. He used this tree to capture the power of an aspect of [[Lurue]] and divert it for his own purposes.

==Description==
Likely an [[ash]], the tree was over {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}} in height, with an ovoid canopy of sickly leaves that dripped with a disturbing fluid. It had a twisted, blackened trunk, with a large, partially burst cyst at its base.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|280|30}}

==Habitats==
The only known specimen of the Thieving Ash was in [[The Close]] in the [[Rawlinswood]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|288|30}}

==History==
The Thieving Ash was used by the Rotting Man to steal away the power of [[Araluen]],{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|151}} A small fragment of Araluen's light managed to escape from the trap, creating Ash, a baby that appeared near [[Fullpoint]] in {{yearlink|1368}};{{cite book/Lady of Poison|1-3|Prologue}}Though the Rotting Man captured the Close in 1371 and grew the Thieving Ash afterwards, Araluen's light had already been diverted in 1368. It stands to reason that the Rotting Man had taken some other measure at that time. the Step-Daughter emerged from the cyst at the base of the trunk in {{yearlink|1373}}.
