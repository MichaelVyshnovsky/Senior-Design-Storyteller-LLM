        "mainbody": "aggerthorn briar was a mundane species of thorny plant that was hard to maneuver through and colorfully described by some as being \"bloodthirsty\". Because of its hazardous nature, some cruel nobles would plant daggerthorn around their villa grounds as protection.\nThis species of plant grew in deep woods and parts of the Feywild, such as the area known as Spiderwood.\nFollowing the Spellplague, the inhabitants of the city of New Sharandar grew daggerthorn briars on their defensive wall, the Living Abatis."
