        "Description": "The braskh root had a bright red skin covering a white, crisp flesh.",
        "Uses": "The uses of braskh varied depending on the amount being consumed. Lightly grated flakes of braskh were added to water used to boil vegetables, giving them a hint of spice. The [[Delzimmer|Delzmaeran]] fiery brown gravy called [[sakra]] used braskh in more liberal quantities. Small, decoratively carved shapes of raw braskh root were set afloat in both beverages and medicinal elixirs. If a shape was chewed, most people perspired as if they had done heavy labor, cried as if they lost a loved one, and had profuse discharges from the nose and mouth. If swallowed whole, it purged the other end of the digestive tract, acting as a strong laxative.",
        "Culture": "In Delzimmer, it was usually the adolescents that ventured into the surrounding countryside with their hand tocks (small [[mattock]]s with short handles) to harvest braskh roots. One full-sized root or two smaller ones typically sold for a [[copper piece]]."
