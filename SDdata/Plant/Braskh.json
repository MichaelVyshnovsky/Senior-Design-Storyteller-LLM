        "mainbody": "raskh was a root found in stony areas often protected by thorn bushes in southern and southeastern Faer√ªn.\nThe braskh root had a bright red skin covering a white, crisp flesh.\nThe uses of braskh varied depending on the amount being consumed. Lightly grated flakes of braskh were added to water used to boil vegetables, giving them a hint of spice. The Delzmaeran fiery brown gravy called sakra used braskh in more liberal quantities. Small, decoratively carved shapes of raw braskh root were set afloat in both beverages and medicinal elixirs. If a shape was chewed, most people perspired as if they had done heavy labor, cried as if they lost a loved one, and had profuse discharges from the nose and mouth. If swallowed whole, it purged the other end of the digestive tract, acting as a strong laxative.\nIn Delzimmer, it was usually the adolescents that ventured into the surrounding countryside with their hand tocks (small mattocks with short handles) to harvest braskh roots. One full-sized root or two smaller ones typically sold for a copper piece."
