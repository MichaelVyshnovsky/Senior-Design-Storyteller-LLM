        "mainbody": "ue of midnight darkness was a tree whose wood was used in the creation of magical items. It was only known to grow in Moradask, within the Haunted Lands of Zakhara.\nThe wood grew as a bamboo-like plant, with solid black gnarled wood, sprouting networks of white, pallid leaves.\nHue of midnight darkness only grew in very specific environments, requiring darkness, moisture, salt, and specific magical emanations.\nThe wood drained magic from its surroundings, dispelling magic within  quite powerfully while live.\nOnce dried, the wood could be enchanted to make staves that held half again as many charges. Furthermore, the process of enchanting was far more likely to succeed on staves made of hue of midnight darkness.\nIn the late mid-14 century DR, the necromancess Kazerabet sought hue of midnight darkness to enchant a staff of the magi. All she could determine about the ingredient through legend lore was \"seek the hue of midnight darkness beneath the Sea of Salt\". She may have resorted to underhanded methods to secure the cooperation of adventurers, or she may have offered to enchant two items if they brought enough of the wood.\nIt is possible the adventurers may have found a patch of such wood in an underground chamber, beneath the ruins of Moradask, a mile beneath the earth, accessible from the Temple of Ishistu within the city this was the abode of the kraken Ur, the Great Squid."
