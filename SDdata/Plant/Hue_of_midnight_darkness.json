It was only known to grow in [[Moradask]], within the [[Haunted Lands]] of [[Zakhara]].",
        "Description": "The wood grew as a bamboo-like plant, with solid black gnarled wood, sprouting networks of white, pallid leaves.",
        "Cultivation": "Hue of midnight darkness only grew in very specific environments, requiring darkness, moisture, salt, and specific magical emanations.{{cite book/Cities of Bone/Adventure Book|63}}",
        "Powers": "The wood drained magic from its surroundings, [[dispel magic|dispelling]] magic within {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} quite powerfully while live.",
        "Usage": "Once dried, the wood could be enchanted to make staves that held half again as many charges. Furthermore, the process of [[enchant an item|enchanting]] was far more likely to succeed on staves made of hue of midnight darkness.",
        "History": "In the late mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the necromancess [[Kazerabet]] sought hue of midnight darkness to enchant a ''[[staff of the magi]]''.{{cite book/Cities of Bone/Adventure Book|52}} All she could determine about the ingredient through ''[[legend lore]]'' was \"seek the hue of midnight darkness beneath the Sea of Salt\". She may have resorted to underhanded methods to secure the cooperation of [[adventurer]]s, or she may have offered to enchant two items if they brought enough of the wood.{{cite book/Cities of Bone/Adventure Book|54}}\n\nIt is possible the adventurers may have found a patch of such wood in an underground chamber, beneath the ruins of [[Moradask]], a mile beneath the earth, accessible from the [[Temple of Ishistu]] within the city: this was the abode of the [[kraken]] [[Ur, the Great Squid]].{{cite book/Cities of Bone/Adventure Book|64}}"
