        "mainbody": "Matabo vines were carnivorous plants that grew in the jungles of Chult.\nMatabo vines were semi-sentient and covered in poisonous barbs. Creatures that came within  of matabo vines found the plants lashing out at them, attempting to restrain and poison them in order to \"drink\" their blood.\nThe matabo were found in dense patches that grew up and around the trunks of trees and could contain hundreds of vines. These could be difficult to spot on the jungle floor, although their presence could be recognized by the fact that they left their host trees looking sickly.\nSome gladiatorial events in the Grand Coliseum of Port Nyanzaru were made more deadly by setting them inside cages covered in matabo vines.\nDuring the late 15 century DR, matabo vines could be found growing on the jungled ridge at the furthest edge of the Malars Throat ward of Port Nyanzaru."
