'''Plantains''' were edible fruits produced by the plantain [[tree]].

==Usage==
Plantains were a staple of [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultan]] cousine. They were cooked, often served with [[fish]] [[koko-yam]]s, and [[palm wine]], or cooked into a sauce.

==Availability==
Plantain trees could be found growing within the gardens of [[Generon]] - the palace of the Lord of [[Arrabar]].

Plantains grew in the jungles of [[Chult]] where they were a part of [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]] diet. In the Agricultural Quarter of [[Mezro]], the tabaxi tribesfolk cultivated plantains, along with many other sources of food for the city.

On the islands of [[Jazirat al-Qraidis]] in the [[Crowded Sea]], plantains were a common sight as well as were objects of trade for the locals. Thick forests of plantain trees granted the city of [[Sams Bandar]] one of its major export goods. Plantains were also widely available for the semi-nomadic [[halfling]]s of the [[Tarangu]], [[Jazayir al-Alfar]]. Plantains also were offered monthly to [[Kar'r'rga]], the great crab god.
