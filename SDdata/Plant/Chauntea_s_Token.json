        "mainbody": "Chaunteas Token was a unique variety of grass sacred to the goddess Chauntea. It was typically guarded from human interference by dryads, who were likewise sacred to the Great Mother.\nThis grass grew to what was considered chest-height for humans. In the summer season it would bloom with blood red, gem-like flowers.\nIn northwest Faer√ªn, the Abbey of Chauntea had a small field of this grass that was guarded by a dryad.\nThe flowers of this grass could be used as an herb."
