'''''Veoriti flower''''' was a species of rare magical plant found on the [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Veoriti petals were white in color and were approximately the size of a [[humanoid]]'s eye.

==Usages==
Veoriti flowers possessed a magic that could grant ''[[infravision]]'' within {{SI|60'|'"|long=yes}} to those who knew how to use its petals. The flower's petals had to be used in twos. Each of the petals was to be placed over the creature's eyes to activate the magic hidden within. When that was done, the petals disappeared, leaving the creature with a temporary ability to see in the dark. The effects of the plant ended within 24 hours after activation.

==History==
In the Year of Discovery of the Malatran calendar, a band of heroes of the Living Jungle encountered a group of strange tiny orange-skinned humanoids â€“ [[shan sao]]. Veoriti flower petals were gifted to the group after a battle against the deadly evil [[tiger katanga]].
