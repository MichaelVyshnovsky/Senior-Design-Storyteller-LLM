        "mainbody": "A '''retch plant''', also known as a '''globe palm''', was a type of [[tree]].",
        "Description": "Retch plants resembled regular [[palm tree]]s. From the top foliage grew large spherical fruits. The fruit had a firm but membranous interior and varied in color, usually blue, lilac or violet.\n\nThe fruit's interior held a sticky and putrid liquid. When they fell from the tree, the fruit exploded and covered everything within {{SI|5|ft}} with said liquid. If a creature was struck with the liquid, it was so foul that it triggered nausea and vomiting. The fluid's scent attracted carnivorous creatures up to {{SI|50|ft}} distant, and the only way to remove it was with alcohol.",
        "Ecology": "The plant whose mature variety produced [[poison]]ous [[pepper]]-like dust, which prevented its own seedlings from growing in the nearby area."
