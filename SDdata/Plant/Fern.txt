The '''fern''' was a common type of plant in [[Faerûn]].

==Variations==
===Softwood===
The softwood fern grew well in the sandy soil of the [[Rimwood]], despite it being covered in slowly decomposing pine needles.

===Moonfern===
Moonfern was a type of fern found in the [[midwood]] area of the forest of [[Cormanthor]]. It was found in the groves of [[alder]]s, [[hickory|hickories]] and [[bitternut]]s.

==Habitats==
Noble houses of [[Arrabar]] kept lush green gardens and used copious flower planters as decorations throughout their homes. Ferns were among the many plants that grew inside lush mansions. Namely, [[House Pharaboldi]] kept decorative fern planters.

==Cooking==
The parts of a fern—the fronds and the fiddlehead of a coiled young fern—were used in cooking, such as [[fern-frond soup]] and [[fiddlehead soup]], [[fern-and-fiddlehead soup]], boiled fiddleheads, and fiddlehead butter. There was also [[fern-and-mint wine]].
