Charchuka was a plant whose roots were edible.
The charchuka was only found in Tymanther,As most of the lands of Tymanther were in fact portions of Laerakond, a continent of Abeir, that had exchanged parts with the native soil during the Spellplague.
The roots of the charchuka were used in Thymari dishes, the most popular among them being the t√ºrkhaari.
