'''Wyrmsage''' was a plant found in [[Northwest Faerûn]], valued for its arcane properties and its usage as a [[spell]] reagent in certain magics.

{{quote|You need only sprinkle the bodies with this extract. If any souls remain trapped within, their negative energies will be suppressed, and they will be free to pass beyond this world.|[[Nya]], a herbalist of [[Port Llast]]}}

==Usage==
Wyrmsage extract was dried and mixed with certain other reagents to produce a powder that could be sprinkled on dead bodies, interfering with [[necromancy]] and protecting the corpses from being ''[[Raise dead|raised]]'' by all but more powerful magics. Some believed that the powder suppressed [[negative energy]] and allowed souls trapped within the dead to escape; however, more scholarly [[mage]]s knew that that was just a dramatic assumption on the properties of souls, but the effect of the powder was indisputable.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the hero remembered as [[Kalach-Cha]], and later, as The Knight-Captain, was framed by the slaughter of the village of [[Ember]]. The hero and their companions set out to investigate the charred ruins. In the process, they met [[Nya]], a herbalist of [[Port Llast]], who sold them wyrmsage powder to sprinkle over the slaughtered villages, preventing them from returning as the [[undead]].
