A redflower was a tiny, distinctly red-hued flower that grew within the bogs of central Faerûn. It was native in the lands of Cormyr, Sembia and the Dragon Coast.
When the leaves of the redflower were dried, crushed and ingested they were known to greatly improve the hand–eye coordination of the imbiber. This effect would last for about 10 minutes. However, if someone took too much of this substance they would become nauseated.
When prepared, one "dose" of redflower leaves was 300 gp.
