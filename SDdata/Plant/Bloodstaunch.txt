Bloodstaunch was an herb used to stop or slow the bleeding of an open wound.  
The herb could typically be found in gullies located in relatively arid, temperate regions.
Bloodstaunch could be applied directly to open wounds. It thickened blood almost immediately, causing bleeding to slow or stop completely. Bloodstaunch had a base value of 10 gp.
