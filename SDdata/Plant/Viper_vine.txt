'''Viper vines''' were intelligent plants that grew in the jungles of [[Chult]].

==Description==
These thick vines were hungry and malicious. They hung from trees and were very difficult to distinguish from normal, harmless vines.

==Ecology==
Viper vines launched surprise attacks on passing creatures, including [[humanoid]]s, in order to feed on them. They would wrap around and begin to constrict their victims, and in the process released a paralytic [[poison]] to prevent their prey from breaking free. Once the victim was dead, the vines would begin to "eat" them.
