Viper vines were intelligent plants that grew in the jungles of Chult.
These thick vines were hungry and malicious. They hung from trees and were very difficult to distinguish from normal, harmless vines.
Viper vines launched surprise attacks on passing creatures, including humanoids, in order to feed on them. They would wrap around and begin to constrict their victims, and in the process released a paralytic poison to prevent their prey from breaking free. Once the victim was dead, the vines would begin to "eat" them.
