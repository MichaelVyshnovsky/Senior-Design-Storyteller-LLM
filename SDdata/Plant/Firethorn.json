        "Description": "The presence of firethorn gave the Island of the Firethorns a lovely red coloration. Though beautiful, the firethorn plant's thorns carried a dangerous [[poison]], creating a natural barrier that surrounded most of the lower portions of the island since the plants grew so close together. Firethorn plants also gave off natural heat and glowed softly."
