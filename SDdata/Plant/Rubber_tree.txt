'''Rubber trees''', sometimes called '''rubber plants''', were a rare kind of [[tree]] found on [[Toril]]. They were particularly valuable among Toril's many types of [[tree]]s.{{Cite dragon/125/Woodlands of the Realms|14}} 

==Ecology==
Rubber trees could be found on the [[Malatran Plateau]],{{Cite web/RPGA Living Jungle/Jungle Tales 3}} in [[Maztica]], and in particular regions in the far [[South Faerûn|south]] of [[Faerûn]], notably in the jungles of [[Chult]]. They tended to share habitats with [[cork (tree)|cork trees]]. 

Rubber trees were also noted to exist in other [[crystal sphere]]s, such as on [[Krynn]] and [[Oerth]].

===Uses===
The trees were a source of [[rubber]], a congealed product made from their sap. and rubber trees were cultivated for rubber by the tribes of [[Malatra]].

Rubber tree sap (sometimes called "uncured rubber") could also serve as a [[material component]] in the [[spell]]s ''[[Bowgentle's fleeting journey]]''{{Cite dragon/97/Pages from the Mages IV|31}} and ''[[erase]]''  and was proposed to be useful for creating ''[[potions of acid resistance]]''.

==History==
By the mid-to-late 13{{th}} century [[DR]], heavy harvests of rubber trees had led their populations to dwindle. This led to expeditions delving into the Chultan jungles simply with the goal of finding more of them.

Throughout the Amnian occupation of [[Port Nyanzaru]] in the 15{{th}} century DR, Chultan rubber trees and timbers were harvested and exported by Amnian trading companies.
