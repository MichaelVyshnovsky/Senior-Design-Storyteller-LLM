Myrrh trees were type of tree, notable for their use in making myrrh.
The tree resembled a squat, thorny bush.
Myrrh trees grew among frankincense and dragons blood plants along streams that flowed from the Desertsmouth Mountains into the desert, generally along the eastern and northeastern edges of the Sword, as well as in the westward hills verging the Plain of Standing Stones.
The Dtarig harvested some myrrh, but the vast majority was handled by Bedine people who sold it in exchange for metalwork. Along with frankincense, cassia, and dragons blood, myrrh was one of the luxury exports of the region.
