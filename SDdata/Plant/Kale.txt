Kale, also known as broadleaf, was a green vegetable grown in Faerûn.
Kale was grown in many places across Faerûn, particularly in the village of Cragmyr of the Sword Coast.
This vegetable was known to be eaten in Sembia in soups, and was often paired with the versatile turnip.
In the 14 century DR, Wigluf used his magical abilities to spawn a great sky-reaching crop of vegetables, including both turnips and kale.
