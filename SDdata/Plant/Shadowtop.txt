'''Shadowtop''' was a type of common tree that grew throughout [[Faerûn]].

==Description==
Shadowtops could grow to be {{SI|90|ft|long=yes}} tall, growing at a rate of {{SI|2|ft|c|long=yes}} per year. Their irregular, feathering leaves grew at the very top of the tree, having dark green tops and a coppery hue on the underside. The tops of Shadowtops were prone to fire.

==Usage==
Shadow-wood was fibrous, making it undesirable for building but good for ropemaking. The fibrous wood was good for cookfires as it burned hot and slow without giving off much smoke.

Shadow-wood was used to make magical [[staff|staves]], [[rod]]s and [[wand|wands]].

==History==
Shadowtop trees flourished in [[1314 DR]].
