It tasted bland but was surprisingly rich on nutrients.\nOn the Nelanther Islands, also known as Pirate Isles of the Sea of Swords, breadfruit trees were plentiful, often providing castaways and survivors of shipwrecks washed ashore with life-saving source of food.\nIn Calimshan a crossbreed species of breadfruit and date existed and was called \"palintrike\".\nLike many other exotic foodstuffs, breadfruits were imported and sold in Waterdeep by some of the more adventurous and knowledgeable vendors.\nBreadfruit main use was food. The simplest way of preparing it was boiling shelled and sliced flesh and pummeling it into mash."
