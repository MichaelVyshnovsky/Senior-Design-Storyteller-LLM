        "mainbody": "Feather Skin was a very rare species of flower native to the jungles of Chult.\nThe petals of a Feather Skin flower dissolved on the tongue. Once they had done so, the petal eradicated all traces of any disease that the patient might be suffering from.\nThe druid Arvo of Ravens Bluff noted the curative properties of Feather Skin in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. He was unable to find very many of the flowers, and so was quite loathe to part with more a couple of petals."
