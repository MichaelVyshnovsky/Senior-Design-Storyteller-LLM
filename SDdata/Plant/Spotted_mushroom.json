        "mainbody": "potted mushroom was a species of fungus used in cooking on the Sword Coast North, gathered in Neverwinter Wood, notable for its taste and red cap.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Jingo Rummage, a halfling adventurer, gathered forest herbs in Neverwinter Wood when his companion Jodri was eaten by wild wolf-men. As revenge, Jingo asked a group of Neverwintran adventurers to gather umber leaves, spotted mushrooms, and spiceroot, to add them to the wolves cooking pots. The aroma attracted hungry ogres to the camp, who, in turn, slaughtered the beast-men."
