==Habitats==
* In [[Faer√ªn]], these trees could be found in the nation of [[Unther]]'s [[Methwood]].
* In the [[Hordelands]], mulberry trees could be found in the [[Plain of Horses]], particularly being cultivated by the community of [[Peqqir]] following the nomad [[Torgoja P'a]]'s helping its people to create an irrigation system.
* In [[Kara-Tur]],
* In [[Zakhara]], the [[House of Al-Kamari]] tended to mulberry orchards that stood south of the city of [[Huzuz]].

==Usage==

* Mulberry trees were among the favorite foods of Kara-Tur's [[insectoid gargantua]].
* The leaves of mulberry trees played an important role in the production of [[silk]], as they were needed to feed the silkworms that produced cocoons from which silk was processed.

*''[[Mulberry Leaf]]'' and ''[[Silkworm (weapon)|Silkworm]]'' were [[butterfly sword]]s - [[Shou]] weapons, that once belonged to [[Yu Mao]], a crime lord from [[Thesk]].
