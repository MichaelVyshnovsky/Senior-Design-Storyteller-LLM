The '''hinny''' was a giant flower that resembled a bright blue buttercup with petals 10 feet (3 m) in diameter that remained closed in a ball-like shape for most of the year. The petals only opened for one day in the first week of spring, and there was a small pool of nectar inside. The nectar could be absorbed into the body, usually&mdash;but not always&mdash;with beneficial effects. If the flower's petals were opened artificially, it would disintegrate to dust, and the nectar would evaporate. The hinny only grew in the [[starwood]] area of the forest of [[Cormanthor]].<ref>
