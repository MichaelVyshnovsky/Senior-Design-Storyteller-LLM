Ateris was an ugly, thorny plant native to the slopes of the Thunder Peaks and Storm Horns in Cormyr. It was particularly abundant in the areas near the town of Tilverton, and could be found easily when their scent caught on the wind.
The flowers of the ateris plant had a particularly aromatic bud that secreted a nearly invisible, solution. When rubbed under the nose, this substance would cover up any foul odors an individual came across. While it was great for masking malodorous scents, it was a potent irritant when it came into contact with the inside of the nostril. The bud degraded rather rapidly, typically losing its potency in a matter of weeks. 
Ateris buds were particularly useful when traveling to Marsember during the summer months. 
During his travels, the sage Nibulus Loral met one man who was allergic to the bud of the ateris plant. When he applied the plant under his nostrils he broke out into a severe rash that lasted a tenday.
