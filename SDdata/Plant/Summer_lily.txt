'''Summer lily''' was a species of flowering plant known for its pleasant scent.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], summer lily flowers were available in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. Some used [[oil]] infused with summer lily to scent [[wax]] used in flower preservation. The concoction worked well on full bouquets dipped in scented wax, hiding smell of rot and decay, however, summer lily scent lacked variety and complexity.
