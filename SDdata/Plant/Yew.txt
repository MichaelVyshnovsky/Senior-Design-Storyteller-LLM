The '''yew''' tree was a perennial plant that could be found throughout [[Faer没n]].{{Cite web/Adventure Locales: The Yew Tree}}

==Description==
The average yew could grow to be {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} or more in diameter, with canopies reaching lengths of {{SI|50|ft|long=yes}} or greater. Like [[oak]] trees they could live for hundreds or even thousands of years. Their wood was strong, yet flexible. All parts of a yew, with the exception of their red berries, were [[poison]]ous to ingest. The poison that could be derived from yew was known as [[taxine]].

==Varieties==
Yew trees came in varied types. Some yews appeared to be deep red in color, particularly the unique [[magic]]al yews of [[Evermeet]].

==Habitats==
* Evermeet.
* In [[north Faer没n]], yew could be found in abundance in [[Shadowdale]] around the [[Shadow Ridge]].
* Yew trees grew in the thick deciduous forests of the [[Moonshae Isles]].
* In [[south Faer没n]], yew could be found in the [[Forest of Amtar]].
* In the [[Unapproachable East]], yew could be found in the [[Forest of Lethyr]].
* In [[the Vast]], the road leading away from [[Ring Park]] in the [[Foreign District (Ravens Bluff)|Foreign District of Ravens Bluff]] was lined with yew trees.

==Usages==
* The wood of yew trees was used to make a variety of combative items, particularly [[bow]]s, [[wand]]s, [[staves]], and [[light crossbow]]s. Their wood was particularly prized by bowmakers for its flexibility.
* Yew wood was also used for non-combat items, such as sturdy [[fishing rod]]s.
