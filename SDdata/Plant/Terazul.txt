Terazul was a flowering plant found only in a few locations in the jungles south of Delzimmer. It was also the name of a somewhat addictive drug made from the leaves of the plant.
When ground into a powder and snorted, the drug was a powerful stimulant, causing the user to remain awake for days at a time. When drunk as a potion it caused visions.
The plants properties were thought to be due to its ability to tap into lingering pockets of spellplague. In reality, the plants roots grew out of portals to the Far Realm, which had been opened by derro in the Underdark.
The terazul trade was controlled by House Serrat of Delzimmer.
In the , a group led by Alaia Serrat and her adopted daughter Zaltys closed the portal to the Far Realm, destroying the terazul plants.
In the late 15 century DR, members of the Guild worked with smugglers who brought drugs, weapons, firewine, and other substances into Baldurs Gate. Pouches of  terazul were among such illicit goods.
