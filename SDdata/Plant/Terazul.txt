'''Terazul''' was a flowering plant found only in a few locations in the jungles south of [[Delzimmer]]. It was also the name of a somewhat addictive [[drug]] made from the leaves of the plant.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|843}}

==Ecology==
When ground into a powder and snorted, the drug was a powerful stimulant, causing the user to remain awake for days at a time. When drunk as a [[potion]] it caused visions.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|3388}}

The plant's properties were thought to be due to its ability to tap into lingering pockets of [[spellplague]].{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|847}} In reality, the plant's roots grew out of portals to the [[Far Realm]], which had been opened by [[derro]] in the [[Underdark]].{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|3140}}

==History==
The terazul trade was controlled by [[House Serrat]] of Delzimmer.

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a group led by [[Alaia Serrat]] and her adopted daughter [[Zaltys Serrat|Zaltys]] closed the ''[[portal]]'' to the Far Realm, destroying the terazul plants.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|3648}}

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], members of [[the Guild]] worked with smugglers who brought drugs, [[weapon]]s, [[firewine]], and other substances into [[Baldur's Gate]]. Pouches of {{SI|0.8|lb|k|long=yes}} terazul were among such illicit goods.
