'''Turmeric''' was a flowering plant, related to [[ginger]], that was harvested for its thick fleshy roots that were used as a type of [[spices|spice]].

==Availability==
Throughout the Realms, turmeric was distributed via ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' and was valued at 25 [[gold piece]]s per {{SI|1|oz||long=yes}}.

The main location in the Realms that exported turmeric was [[Anauroch]].

==Usage==
Turmeric roots were known to have some medicinal properties.

The [[Bedine]] women of Anauroch used turmeric, along with [[tanbark]], as [[makeup]] and sunscreen, while the wider population of the Realms used them as [[dye]]s. While their price was relatively low, their availability was intermittent.

Turmeric was a common spice used in [[Turmish]].{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-10/Turmishan spices}}

Well-prepared travellers in [[South Faerûn|South]] and [[East Faerûn]] often carried a variety of spices and flavorings, including turmeric.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-13 - Spices When Traveling}}

Turmeric could be mixed with [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[deepfire]] [[brandy]] to make a substance that surface-dried as a clear coating (such as on metal), but when it dried completely after a few more hours, it disintegrated to ocher-colored turmeric powder once more. It could be used to surreptitiously mark items and those who handled them by the bright stains it left behind.
