Turmeric was a flowering plant, related to ginger, that was harvested for its thick fleshy roots that were used as a type of spice.
Throughout the Realms, turmeric was distributed via Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue and was valued at 25 gold pieces per .
The main location in the Realms that exported turmeric was Anauroch.
Turmeric roots were known to have some medicinal properties.
The Bedine women of Anauroch used turmeric, along with tanbark, as makeup and sunscreen, while the wider population of the Realms used them as dyes. While their price was relatively low, their availability was intermittent.
Turmeric was a common spice used in Turmish.
Well-prepared travellers in South and East Faer√ªn often carried a variety of spices and flavorings, including turmeric.
Turmeric could be mixed with dwarven deepfire brandy to make a substance that surface-dried as a clear coating (such as on metal), but when it dried completely after a few more hours, it disintegrated to ocher-colored turmeric powder once more. It could be used to surreptitiously mark items and those who handled them by the bright stains it left behind.
