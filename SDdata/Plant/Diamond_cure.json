        "mainbody": "Diamond Cure was a name given to a species of herb with antivenom properties that grew in Pelleors Prairie.\nThis herb looked much like a clover, but with diamond-shaped leaves. It grew in large patches that could be easily grazed on by bison or collected by humanoids. It tasted similar to oregano, except more bitter.\nConsuming the leaves of Diamond Cure could counteract the effects of most snake venom, and could be used both to reduce the discomfort of minor bites and to save lives in the case of serious ones. It was recommended as a natural remedy for bites from both reed snakes and dead grass snakes.\nWhile it was most potent when fresh, it retained some potency if harvested and dried thoroughly."
