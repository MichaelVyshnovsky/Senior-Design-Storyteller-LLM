        "mainbody": "'''Diamond Cure''' was a name given to a species of [[herb]] with antivenom properties that grew in [[Pelleor's Prairie]].",
        "Description": "This herb looked much like a clover, but with diamond-shaped leaves. It grew in large patches that could be easily grazed on by [[bison]] or collected by [[humanoid]]s. It tasted similar to [[oregano]], except more bitter.",
        "Usage": "Consuming the leaves of Diamond Cure could counteract the effects of most [[snake]] venom, and could be used both to reduce the discomfort of minor bites and to save lives in the case of serious ones. It was recommended as a natural remedy for bites from both [[reed snake]]s and [[dead grass snake]]s.\n\nWhile it was most potent when fresh, it retained some potency if harvested and dried thoroughly."
