'''Duskwood''' was a type of [[tree]] found growing all over [[Faer没n]].

==Description==
Duskwoods grew in densely packed groves, blocked the light, and appeared rather eerie, giving them their name. They had smooth black bark and the trunks grew to an average height of 60 feet (18.2 meters), with small lacy branches high on the tree. Atop these trunks were small branches. The wood was smoky gray and as tough as [[iron]].

Duskwoods were very resistant to fire,

==Usage==
Some craftspeople fashioned weapons out of duskwood in place of metal. Such items weighed half as much as their metal counterparts. Duskwood didn't make good armor (even with a ''[[wood shape]]'' spell), though a passable [[breastplate]] could be made out of it. Mast spars and roof beams were usually made of duskwood.

The ''[[Blackstaff (staff)|Blackstaff]]'' and the ''[[Scepter of Savras]]'' were made of duskwood. ''[[Thyrsus of the druid]]'' staves were often carved from single pieces of duskwood.

==Habitats==
Duskwood trees were known to be found in the following places:
* Within the city of [[Evereska]].
* [[Cormanthor]]
* In [[interior Faer没n]], duskwoods could occasionally be found throughout the lowlands of the [[Cormyr]] countryside.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2007)/Cormyr Countryside}}
* In [[the Vast]], duskwoods could be found in the [[Adhe Wood]], the [[Flooded Forest]], [[Tavilar]], and in the forested land surrounding the [[Blackwood Manor]].
* [[Sword Coast North]]: [[Ardeep Forest]]
* In the [[Nelanther Isles]], these trees grew in the southern section of the pair of islets known as [[the Tusks]].
* [[Northwest Faer没n|The North]]: [[Glimmerwood]]/[[Moonwood]]; [[Silverymoon]];
* In [[Tethyr]], these trees could be found around the village of [[Mosstone]].
* In the [[Unapproachable East]], duskwoods could be found throughout [[Aglarond]]. Their presence was thought by some to be evidence of ancient [[elf|elven]] inhabitation of the region.
* A small number of these trees grew on the island of [[Evermeet]].
