'''Jeklpa vine''' was a plant that grew in the jungles of [[Chult]].

==Description==
These thorny vines could grow up and around structures.

==Ecology==
In the jungle, creatures paralyzed by jeklpa vines were quickly set upon by predators. The rotting remains of these creatures then became food for the jeklpa.

===Uses===
The [[Kuro]] [[goblin]]s of Chult were known to have jeklpa vines growing on the fences of their [[slave]] pens to prevent their captives from escaping.
