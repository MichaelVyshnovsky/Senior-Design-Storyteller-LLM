Jeklpa vine was a plant that grew in the jungles of Chult.
These thorny vines could grow up and around structures.
In the jungle, creatures paralyzed by jeklpa vines were quickly set upon by predators. The rotting remains of these creatures then became food for the jeklpa.
The Kuro goblins of Chult were known to have jeklpa vines growing on the fences of their slave pens to prevent their captives from escaping.
