        "mainbody": "Yggdrasils Child was a tree of great power grown from a seed of the World Ash, Yggdrasil. The tree stood in a remote grove on the island of Ruathym north of the Moonshae Isles.\nThe tree retained enormous power and anyone carving their name in the tree would grow in power as the tree grew. The tree protected itself with forest creatures it had enhanced with magic.\nLiriel Baenre visited the tree in the  to inscribe a rune on the tree in order to gain the power of the Windwalker amulet. She was led to it and somewhat instructed in regards to it by Ulf the Shaman of Ruathym town. She described the tree as a magical, huge ancient oak with dozens of complex runes carved into the tree. She also explained that it was the \"symbol of life.\"\nBy the late 15 century DR, the tree could no longer be used as a portal."
