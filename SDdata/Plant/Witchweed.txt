The weed of the witch, which was also called simply witchweed, was type of plant that had a profoundly negative effect on wizards.
Witchweed was long and green.
The fumes of burning witchweed produced a cloud measuring  across. A wizard caught within the cloud began coughing violently, preventing them from casting spells while causing physical harm as well. The fumes lasted for 11â€“17 minutes before dissipating.
Witchweed was used in Luthcheq since wizards were banned from entering the city.
