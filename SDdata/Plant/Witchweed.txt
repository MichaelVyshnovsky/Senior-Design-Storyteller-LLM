The '''weed of the witch''', which was also called simply '''witchweed''', was type of plant that had a profoundly negative effect on [[wizard]]s.

==Description==
Witchweed was long and green.

==Powers==
The fumes of burning witchweed produced a cloud measuring {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} across. A wizard caught within the cloud began coughing violently, preventing them from casting [[spell]]s while causing physical harm as well. The fumes lasted for 11â€“17 minutes before dissipating.

==History==
Witchweed was used in [[Luthcheq]] since wizards were banned from entering the city.
