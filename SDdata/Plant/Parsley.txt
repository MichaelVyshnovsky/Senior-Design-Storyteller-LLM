'''Parsley''' was a species of edible fragrant [[herb]] that received wide culinary usage across [[Faerûn]]. and beyond.

==Availability==
Parsley was cultivated for culinary use as far as the herb gardens of the hot lands of [[Zakhara]].

A variety of [[elf|elven]] blue-leaved parsley in [[Waterdeep]] was brought up and sold from [[Skullport]] by its [[drow]] merchants, but some locals confused that herb with parsley exported from [[Secomber]].{{Cite dragon/402/The Rise of Bardic Beauty|12}}

Some [[mage]]s knew an [[evocation]] [[spell]] that could create herbs and [[spice]]s. This spell, ''[[Spice (spell)|spice]]'', could conjure parsley, along with many other edible flavorings.{{Cite dragon/59/Cantrips: Minor magics for would-be wizards|8}}
