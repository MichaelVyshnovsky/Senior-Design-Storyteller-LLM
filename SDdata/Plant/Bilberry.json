        "Usage": "Said to be very palatable, the berries of this shrub were a staple in the diet of many animals that inhabited the High Moor plateau. With even [[human]]s and [[goblinkin]] known to forage for them.\n\nSome used bilberry in the treatment of certain medical conditions, such as dropsy and typhoid.<ref>"
