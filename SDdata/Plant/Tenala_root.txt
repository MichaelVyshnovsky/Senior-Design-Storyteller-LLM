Tenala root, translated from the Kukalatu language as "eat-happy-mostly," was a plant native to the Malatran Plateau of Kara-Tur.
Tenala roots were found growing near the Kukalatu tribe territories on the southeastern shores of the Hebika River. The plants roots were edible and, according to the reformed Kukalaturi cannibals, tasted just like the Simbari people.
In the late 14 century DR, The Year of New Peoples of the Malatran calendar, the elderly cook of the Kukalatu Village, eNuka Ximi, shared the culinary secrets of the tribe with the heroes of the Living Jungle. They included the Simbara tribesmen taste, and that palm hearts tasted like Koshiva.
