'''Iticala trees''' were a species of tall sap-producing deciduous [[tree]]s found growing in the jungles of the [[Malatran Plateau]].{{Cite living jungle/Plague|19-20}}

==Description==
Iticala trees were tall trees with thick and thorny trunks. The trunks rise high towards the sky, with branches and leaves growing halfway up the trunks and all the way to the top. The branches spread out evenly and stretched parallel to the ground, lush with numerous large red-veined leaves. The tree was known for producing iticala sap at the joints where the branches emerged from the trunk.

===Usage===
Iticala sap was a natural secretion of the iticala trees. It was a thick and oily viscous substance with a strong scent. The sap was harmless and served as a food source for tiny [[flies]] as well as large [[leaf spider]]s. The sap left grease on the fingers of those who touched it and could serve as a high-quality [[lantern oil]].

[[Saru]]—[[ape]]-like [[humanoids]] of the [[Living Jungle]]—knew of the sap's flammable properties and used it to devastate the breeding grounds of [[luroki]], a disease-spreading insect.{{Cite living jungle/Plague|17}}

Iticala sap could also be used to create healing [[iticala curing jelly]].{{Cite living jungle/Plague|30}}
