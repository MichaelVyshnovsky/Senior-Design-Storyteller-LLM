        "mainbody": "Manriki were a type of berry-bearing bush native to the Malatran Plateau of Kara-Tur.\nManriki was a stout little flowering bush that was virtually indistinguishable from the biseechee shrub that bore edible berries. The only difference between the two species of plants was the manriki berries deeper red color and three-petal flowers.\nDespite being sweet and delicious, the berries of this plant were dangerously poisonous to most humanoids of the Living Jungle. Poisoning symptoms started with disorientation, biliousness, and a bad headache. If the affected individual started seeing spots, it was a telltale sign of incoming blindness that usually set in within a single hour after consumption. Thankfully, in most cases, blindness was not permanent and naturally passed within 3 to 30 minutes.\nCuriously enough, manriki berry juice could be mixed with a secret concoction of a burning balm made of various jungle plants and substances. On its own, this type of burning balm was fairly weak, but with a small amount of manriki berry juice introduced into the mixture, the balm ignited with intense flames of orange, then yellow, then blinding white, hot enough to destroy some of the strongest magical obsidian items.\nJust like biseechee, manriki grew on the fringes of the Rayanna Savannah of Malatra.\nOne year before the Year of Tigers Return, Malatran calendar, Bengoukee, a powerful witch doctor of the Tribe of Big Chief Bagoomba, prepared a burning balm in order to destroy a powerful artifact of evil corrupting power â€“ Statue of Klelal. With his help, a band of heroes of the Living Jungle smothered the statue with the balm. With a single drop of manriki berry juice, the Statue of Klelal was no more."
