        "mainbody": "'''Menga''' was a variety of bush that could be found in the jungles of [[Chult]]. The leaves of the menga bush had healing properties.",
        "Description": "Leaves of the menga plant were thin, long, and green in color and composed of fine fibers.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Uses": "To access the healing properties of menga leaves, they had to be dried for at least a day before being ground up, dissolved in heated liquid, and ingested. It took about {{SI|1|ounce|long=yes}} to confer any benefits, which were mild relative to most [[magic]]al healing. Ingesting more than {{SI|5|ounces|long=yes}} in a day could render a creature unconscious for up to an hour. Ahealthy menga bush had enough leaves to produce up to {{SI|12|ounces|long=yes}} of dried leaves.\n\n[[File:Menga Cloth.png|thumb|''Menga cloth'']]\nIn addition, the long and fine fibers of the leaves could be woven into menga cloth, which was used for everything from fabric to awnings to ships' sails."
        },
        "History": "The druid [[Arvo]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] noted the curative properties of menga leaves in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nMenga bushes were grown in the gardens of [[Nangalore]] and could be found in [[Omu]].\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the sale of plants such as menga in [[Port Nyanzaru]] was governed by the [[Port Nyanzaru#Merchant Princes|merchant prince]] [[Jessamine]]. An ounce of dried menga leaves sold for 2 [[gold pieces]] in Chult while a bolt of menga cloth could cost 50 gold pieces."
