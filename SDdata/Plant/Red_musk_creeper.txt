The red musk creeper was a peculiar and dangerous plant found in Faer√ªn, related to the yellow musk creeper.
The creepers produced a pollen that caused a sickness in humanoids, leading to a period of feverish incapacitation, confusion, and the irreversible transformation into a red musk zombie. The zombie could eventually bloom more flowers and further spread the disease.
Red musk creepers and their zombies were first seen during the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, when the druid Halsaime infected the ranger Peron Uthe and allowed him to return to Eveningstar. Feeling sick, Peron went to the Eveningstar War Hospital for treatment, only to transform into a red musk zombie and infect many other patients. The head priest Hurim Jaskyr got adventurers to collect samples from the transformed patients Mikhael Jarvin and Aeron Leifbrand to create an inoculation against infection, allowing Peron to be destroyed. A gardens worth of red musk creepers were later found in the basement of Uthe Lodge, growing around the tree of the corrupted dryad Sylvie, who sought to destroy the entire town.Though not explicitly stated, the circumstances around the red musk outbreak imply that Halsaime created or altered the plant in some way to make it more dangerous.
