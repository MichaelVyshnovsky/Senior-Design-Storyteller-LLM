Scuud (Pronounce|skood|refs=
Scuuds were white, fleshy, and on average grew to the size of a humans fist. They tasted like a cross between a potato ad a radish.
In 1358 DR, a group of goblins and orcs living within the Dungeon Level of Undermountain had scuuds stored with other food for animal feed.
This vegetable was typically used for similar purposes as potatoes.
