'''Echinacea''' was a type of flowering plant related to [[daisy|daisies]]{{Cite dragon/269/Extra Healing|45}} with medicinal properties{{Cite adventurers league/The Fallen Star|8}} that could be found in the [[Icewind Dale]] region.

==Description==
The blooms on these plants bore some resemblance to [[black-eyed susan]]s, albeit when the latter flowers were in a frail, limp, and thin state.

==Usages==
These plants could be used to treat bacterial infections, cysts, boils, and conditions of the nose and sinuses, as well as to purify blood.

Among the [[giff]], these plants were used as an ingredient in [[Herb Tea 33-Alpha]].

==History==
When the giff [[mercenary]] commander, Lieutenant [[Prook (giff)|Prook]], escaped from the [[neogi deathspider]] ''[[Er'lir Fezrrega'l]]'' after it crash-landed in [[Icewind Dale]], he carried written instructions detailing how to help him should he succumb to the elements. These instructions included what was referred to as "Emergency Protocol 33-Alpha", which called for the use of Herb Tea 33-Alpha, as most standard methods of restoration known on [[Toril]] wouldn't work on giff. A recipe for the tea was also included.

A group of [[adventurer]]s helped Prook acquire the ingredients necessary for the herbal [[tea]]. For echinacea, they acquired some from a [[mask (object)|masked]] [[apothecary]] by the name of Butiki, who in actuality was a trio of [[Icewind kobold]]s in a heavy fur coatâ€”[[Bubu]], [[Kiki (kobold)|Kiki]], and [[Tirr]].
