'''Vampire moss''' was a rare parasitic species of [[moss]].

==Description==
Usually pale green in coloration, vampire moss grew in net-like masses ranging from {{SIrange|1|4|ft|long=yes}} in length that hung off of trees and branches. As it fed the moss grew brighter shade of green, becoming a vivid emerald green once fully sated.

==Abilities==
Vampire moss preyed upon other creatures in an aerial manner, [[magic]]ally attaching itself to prey instead of making physical contact and draining them of [[positive energy|life energy]] from afar. Any creature that came within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} of it might feel a prickling sensation on the back of their neck, though a vampire moss always targeted those closest to it.

If harmed by any means other than fire, this moss would slowly regenerate over the course of weeks.

==Ecology==
===Diet===
This species of moss fed upon the life energy of other creatures. It most preferred mammals, especially intelligent ones, as they tended to have more vibrant energy. Only when on the verge of starvation would they resort to feeding upon the life energies of nearby trees.
===Habitats===
Vampire moss was typically found in swamps or tropical woodlands.

On [[Toril]], vampire moss could be found in the [[High Moor]] region and rarely in the forests and mountains of the [[Savage Frontier]].<ref>
===Relationships===
This species of moss served no particular purpose in the ecology of environments it was found in.

They were a [[favored plant]] of the nature [[deity]] [[Rillifane Rallathil]].
===Usages===
Vampire moss could be used as an ingredient for energy draining [[magic]], such as [[ring of weakness|''rings of weakness'']].
