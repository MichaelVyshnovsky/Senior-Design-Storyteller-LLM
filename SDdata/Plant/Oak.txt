Oaks were a type of deciduous tree found in the Realms.
Oak trees that were large and 50 years of age or older were occasionally known to have a mystical ability to form their powerful auras into animate shapes, which typically took the form of a dryad.
Chime oaks were specific to the northern sections of the east starwood, a portion of the forest of Cormanthor. They were like regular oaks, but appeared as though they were made of glass. Their leaves froze easily in autumn and winter, and did not fall off the tree, instead making a tinkling noise in the wind, which gave the tree its name. This noise attracted basilisks. Beyond the starwood, a pair of chime oaks stood in DeVillars Park in Ravens Bluff, protected by strong magical wards.
