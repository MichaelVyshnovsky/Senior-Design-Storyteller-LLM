        "mainbody": "onandurrs were a type of tree native to the Western Heartlands. Their bark itself was considered to be a type of herb.\nThese trees typically grew to be quite tall and had spindly builds.\nWhen the bark of this tree was bound against the open wound of a dwarf, gnome, halfling, or human it would inhibit bleeding and infection. It also aided in the mending of torn flesh and skin, making it expand and knit together. However, this bark had no effect on the open wound of an elf, and when applied to one of a goblinoid it actually made the wound fester.\nTonandurrs were not hardy enough to survive the harsh winters of the lands further north of the Western Heartlands. Despite this, some were known to be kept within indoor gardens in the cities of Silverymoon and Neverwinter."
