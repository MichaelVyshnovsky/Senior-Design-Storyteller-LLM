        "Description": "Thallow leaves were large, green, and almost rubbery, somewhat reminiscent of the [[rhubarb]] plant leaves. The leaves' toughness allowed for the use in personal clean up after [[nightsoil]] egestion, especially when on the road. Thallow leaves could also be washed to be reused later. They retained their usefulness and tough fibers for about three days when carried in a pack or a wagon. After three days, thallow shriveled and became fragile."
