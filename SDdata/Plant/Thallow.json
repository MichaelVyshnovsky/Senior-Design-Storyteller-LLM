The leaves toughness allowed for the use in personal clean up after nightsoil egestion, especially when on the road. Thallow leaves could also be washed to be reused later. They retained their usefulness and tough fibers for about three days when carried in a pack or a wagon. After three days, thallow shriveled and became fragile."
