        "Description": "Karmaks were viewed as almost useless because their wood warped after curing and was heavy with an [[oil]]y sap. A key exception was their use in producing ''[[flame egg]]s''. The sap needed to be refined and distilled into a fine oil, with a more pure oil resulting in more effective ''eggs''."
