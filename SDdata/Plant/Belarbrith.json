        "mainbody": "elarbrith was a more exotic species of tough and hardy root vegetable that survived cold winters and closely resembled a carrot.\nBelarbriths taste could be described as that of an apple pie (the variety that did not include cinnamon). The edible root was chestnut-brown, blotched with gray. It was chewy and hard like an overgrown carrot. The vegetables flesh was lighter brown and flecked with dark red knots or nodes.\nThe wild vegetable could be foraged across the Eastern and Western Heartlands. However, by the late 15 century, it was over-consumed and hard to find near settlements or busy roads. Belarbrith was very commonly cultivated in the Dalelands, Cormyr, northern Sembia, and was gaining popularity on the Sword Coast North. In the northern lands of the Savage Frontier, near Everlund and Silverymoon, Belarbriths growth rate was greatly reduced due to the weather, producing small the, thin vegetable, while southern regions birthed fat and plump roots size of a human forearm.\nBelarbrith roots were thoroughly cleaned of soil and fine hair-like roots, eaten raw, or peeled and sliced into disks. The vegetable was also often used as a culinary thickener or for flavor contrast in pork stews. When boiled and mashed, belarbrith was cooked into a type of dessert soup often consumed in the winter."
