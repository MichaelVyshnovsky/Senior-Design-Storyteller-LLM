        "mainbody": "'''Belarbrith''' was a more exotic species of tough and hardy root vegetable that survived cold winters and closely resembled a [[carrot]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_%282010-2016%29.zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}",
        "Description": "Belarbrith's taste could be described as that of an [[apple pie]] (the variety that did not include [[cinnamon]]). The edible root was [[chestnut]]-brown, blotched with gray. It was chewy and hard like an overgrown carrot. The vegetable's flesh was lighter brown and flecked with dark red knots or nodes.",
        "Availability": "The wild vegetable could be foraged across the [[Eastern Heartlands|Eastern]] and [[Western Heartlands]]. However, by the late 15{{th}} century, it was over-consumed and hard to find near settlements or busy roads. Belarbrith was very commonly cultivated in the [[Dalelands]], [[Cormyr]], northern [[Sembia]], and was gaining popularity on the [[Sword Coast North]]. In the northern lands of the [[Savage Frontier]], near [[Everlund]] and [[Silverymoon]], Belarbrith's growth rate was greatly reduced due to the weather, producing small the, thin vegetable, while southern regions birthed fat and plump roots size of a [[human]] forearm.",
        "Usages": "Belarbrith roots were thoroughly cleaned of soil and fine hair-like roots, eaten raw, or peeled and sliced into disks. The vegetable was also often used as a culinary thickener or for flavor contrast in [[pork]] [[stew]]s. When boiled and mashed, belarbrith was cooked into a type of dessert soup often consumed in the winter."
