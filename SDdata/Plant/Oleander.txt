'''Oleander''' was a species of [[poison]]ous flowering shrubs that grew in [[Faerûn]] and [[Kara-Tur]].

==Habitats==
Wild oleander was known to grow in the oases of [[Anauroch]], the Great Desert.

The black oleander species of the flower were known to grow in abundance in the [[Shadow-cursed Lands]] of the [[Western Heartlands]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Usages==
Oleander was one of several poisonous plants that were transported abroad the ''[[Ginger Lady]]'', a [[Shou]] cargo [[caravel]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Other dangerous plants were [[lantana]], [[castor bean]], [[pink pea]], and [[Shou berry]].

Black oleander flowers were often planted in graveyards and gifted to the sickest patients. But more importantly, black oleander was sought after for its alchemical properties. The flowers could be used to extract vitriol – a thick, dark-colored sap with a syrupy-sweet aroma. That vitriol could be mixed with certain types of alchemical sublimates to create ''[[elixirs of necrotic resistance]]''.

Some believed that black oleander had properties that could halt the spreading of [[necrosis]].
