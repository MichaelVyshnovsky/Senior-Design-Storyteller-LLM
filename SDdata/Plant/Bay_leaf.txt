'''Bay''', also known as '''hotleaves''', was a type of flowering plant on [[Toril]]. Its leaves were commonly used as a flavoring agent in cooking and traded together with other spices.

==Habitats==
Bay trees were native to the warmer climate areas of Toril, which made them a valuable commodity in the areas of cold climates, such as [[Icewind Dale]]. Bay leaves were often one of the commodities filling the wagons of trading caravans moving from [[Luskan]] to [[Ten Towns]].

Beyond Toril, bay trees could be found on the [[Rock of Bral]] in the [[Elven Forest (Bral)|Elven Forest]].

==Usages==
Due to the bay leaves' rich savory and herbal flavors, they often were used in cooking, both dry and fresh. One of the well-known simple and hearty dishes made with bay leaves was a simple [[fowl soup]].

[[Bacchae]] and the [[priest]]s of [[Pan (deity)|Pan]] often wore [[garland]]s made from laurel leaves.

==Trivia==
* One of the lesser known holy symbols of [[Apollo]] was a wreath of laurel leaves.
