'''Goblinberry bushes''' grew on the plains surrounding the [[Battle of Bones]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Description==
These bushes had reddish-purple berries and narrow, dark-green leaves that almost appeared black but had a silver underside.

==Uses==
Sour tasting, goblinberries were a potent [[wikipedia:Astringent|astringent]], but were so strong that, when eaten, they often caused suffocation by swelling of the throat. Because of this, they were commonly considered a poison. However, once stewed and their juice diluted with water and added to large amounts of sugar or honey, these berries made a tasty drink.
