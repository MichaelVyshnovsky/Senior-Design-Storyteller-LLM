'''Wukka trees''', sometimes called '''wazingo trees''',{{Cite dragon+/19/Fiction: Qawasha & Kupalué Part Three}} were a variety of [[magical]] tree that grew in the jungles of [[Chult]].

==Description==
The nuts of the wukka tree were the size of a [[human]] fist, Whenever one of these nuts was shaken, it made a rattling noise and began to glow with a bright, magical light for about one minute. This light was bright enough to illuminate everything within a {{SIAdj|20|foot|long=yes}} radius, at least dimly. Cracking a nut caused it to lose this property.

==Ecology==
Wukka trees grew in groves and were considered to be rare in the Chultan jungle. A grove of them was known to grow along a stream at the foot of a hill just outside the ruins of [[Mezro]].

They made excellent homes for [[jaculi]], [[su-monster]]s, and [[zorbo]]s.
