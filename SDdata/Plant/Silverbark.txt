Silverbarks were a type of tree that grew in Faer√ªn.
Silverbark trees were thin and rarely grew above 12 feet tall. Their red wood was covered in loose silver bark. Their large leaves (as large as human hands) were deep red, waxy, and serrated with a point at the end.
* Silverbarks grew alongside birches in swampy areas in Luruar.
* In the Unapproachable East, silverbarks could be found throughout Aglarond. Their presence was thought by some to be evidence of ancient elven inhabitation of the region.
Silverbark sap, which was clear in color, was a mild antitoxin that could be eaten to prevent some poisonings.
Silverbark leaves were strong enough to be used to make bags and baskets. Natives of the High Moor used silverbark leaves to wrap and protect their food.
Silverbark wood was light and brittle. It was sometimes used by the poor to make stakes.
