'''Silverbarks''' were a type of tree that grew in [[Faerûn]].

==Descriptions==
Silverbark trees were thin and rarely grew above 12 feet tall. Their red wood was covered in loose silver bark. Their large leaves (as large as [[human]] hands) were deep red, waxy, and serrated with a point at the end.

==Habitats==
* Silverbarks grew alongside [[birch]]es in swampy areas in [[Luruar]].
* In the [[Unapproachable East]], silverbarks could be found throughout [[Aglarond]]. Their presence was thought by some to be evidence of ancient [[elf|elven]] inhabitation of the region.

==Usages==
Silverbark sap, which was clear in color, was a mild antitoxin that could be eaten to prevent some poisonings.

Silverbark leaves were strong enough to be used to make bags and baskets. Natives of the [[High Moor]] used silverbark leaves to wrap and protect their food.

Silverbark wood was light and brittle. It was sometimes used by the poor to make stakes.
