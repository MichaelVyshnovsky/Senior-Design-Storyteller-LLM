The vundwood was a species of tree that grew throughout Faer√ªn, particularly abundant in the hills of the Western Heartlands and the Tunlands of Cormyr.
These scrubby trees were relatively short, rarely growing over  tall. Their wood was reddish-brown in color and smelled somewhat of cinnamon, and were covered in thin, dark-red bark with many small outwardly growing branches. The leaves were pale-green and bordered with white, that turned to yellow when winter was approaching or as the tree neared death.
These trees were often used as firewood or felled and dragged into tangled arrangements to form pens for livestock.
When vundwood was used in the creation of magical items it imbued them with a sort of arcane echo, whereby they gained extra changes every few months if they were not entirely depleted.
In addition, vundwood served as a universal replacement material component for both arcane and divine spells related to the recalling of expended spells or the augmentation of a spellcasters magical capacity.
