'''Violets''' were a type of flower that grew in the Realms.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|12-13}}

==History==
The people of [[Waterdeep]] celebrated an annual holiday, known as [[Ahghairon's Day]], during which they would place violets at various altars or plant violets in his memory at the [[House of Wonder]], the [[Plinth]], or [[Ahghairon's Tower|his tower]].

==Habitats==
On [[Toril]], violets were known to grow in [[Cormanthor]], especially in the [[Starwood]]s where [[manticore]]s often slept upon beds of them; in the [[Purple Hills]] of [[Tethyr]]; and in the land of [[Kara-Tur]].

A species of [[Cormyr]]ian violet was used as a decorative houseplants potted and sold in [[Mulmaster]].

==Trivia==
* [[Hannya]] had a strangely strong aversion to violets. They would avoid entering homes that were surrounded by beds of them, avoid touching those who carried bouquets of them, and those who carried bouquets were also unaffected by their spells.
* Violets were a [[favored plant]] of the [[deities]] [[Lliira]] and [[Loviatar]], with the latter preferring dark violets in particular.
