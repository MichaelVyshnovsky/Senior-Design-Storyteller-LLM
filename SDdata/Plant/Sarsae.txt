Sarsae was a hardy savory fruit grown and cultivated in north Faer√ªn.
Sarsae fruits varied in size, depending on the levels of sunlight. They had tough, spotted green skin that changed color from yellow to white as they ripened. The fruits hard flesh was yellow-white in color, similar to that of apples. It had a tart, almost cheese-like flavor.
Sarsae fruits were used in cooking in similar ways to tomatos.
