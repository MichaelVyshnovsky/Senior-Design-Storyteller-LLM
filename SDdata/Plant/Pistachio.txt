Pistachio, also known as loalurr and the shores of the Great Sea in Halruaa.
A type of green shell-covered nut, it was usually sold at 15 gold coins per pound.
Salted pistachio nuts could be found for sale on the streets of Tashalar, a nation on the Chultan Peninsula, where they were a popular handfood.
In Chasoln√©, a place with no kings in Halruaa on the shores of the Great Sea, citizens elected a guild administrator who assigned an official who maintained the local supply of pistachio nuts.
A Zakharan-influenced Bedine sweet treat called vauv was made using roasted tharra nuts, crushed dates, and honey syrup mixed with wild rice flour.
Beyond Toril, pistachios were consumed on Earth. Notably, Elminster and The Wizards Three consumed copious amounts of handfoods when visiting the home of Ed Greenwood, including pistachios.
Some master thieves elected to leave behind loalurr shells as their calling cards.
Occasionally, pistachios were used in preparing iron rations.
