'''Pistachio''', also known as '''loalurr''' and the shores of the [[Great Sea]] in [[Halruaa]].

==Description==
A type of green shell-covered nut, it was usually sold at 15 [[gold]] [[coin]]s per pound.

==Availability==
[[Salt]]ed pistachio nuts could be found for sale on the streets of [[Tashalar]], a nation on the [[Chultan Peninsula]], where they were a popular handfood.

In [[Chasoln√©]], a place with no kings in Halruaa on the shores of the Great Sea, citizens elected a guild administrator who assigned an official who maintained the local supply of pistachio nuts.

A Zakharan-influenced [[Bedine]] sweet treat called [[vauv]] was made using roasted tharra nuts, crushed [[dates]], and [[honey]] syrup mixed with [[wild rice]] [[flour]].

Beyond [[Toril]], pistachios were consumed on [[Earth]]. Notably, [[Elminster]] and [[The Wizards Three]] consumed copious amounts of handfoods when visiting the home of [[Ed Greenwood]], including pistachios.{{Cite dragon/359/Goodbye and Hello, as Always|79}}

==Usages==
Some master [[thieves]] elected to leave behind loalurr shells as their calling cards.

Occasionally, pistachios were used in preparing [[iron ration]]s.
