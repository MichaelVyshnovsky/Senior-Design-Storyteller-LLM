        "mainbody": "'''Sussurs''' were a rare and [[magic]]al species of tree native to the [[Underdark]], found only in the largest of caverns and often in ones where [[wizard fire]] was present.",
        "Description": "On average these trees grew to a height of {{SI|60|ft|long=yes}}. They had long and gnarled branches that sprouted sparse amounts of leaves. Their roots were aerial, similar to those of a [[banyan]]. Sussur plant flowers were large bright blue blossoms that exuded [[honey]]-sweet scent. When the flowers were harvested and exposed to sunlight, the aroma eventually turned rancid and then disappeared.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Diet": "Sussurs thrived almost entirely on [[faerzress]] and other ambient magic in their environment. Because of their appetite for magic, ''[[antimagic field]]s'' spanning {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}} often surrounded them.",
            "Habitats": "One particular area in the Underdark where sussurs could be found was the vault of [[Nuur Throth]] on the western edge of the northern [[Lowerdark]]. There circular groves of them surrounded pockmarked stones covering deep, black wells.\n\nAnother remarkable specimen grew near the [[myconid]] circle known as the [[Ebonlake Grotto]]."
        },
        "History": "The [[Church of Mystra|Mystran]] [[cleric]] [[Lenore De Hurst]] embarked on significant research on sussur trees, specifically the properties of their bark and flowers, in the late 1470s [[DR]]. She had even planted a sussur sapling in a small garden near the [[Arcane Tower]].",
        "Usage": "Sussur were used to produce a rare type of [[paper]].{{Cite adventurers league/Dock Ward Double Cross|6}} Sussur tree bark possessed potent magical properties. If it was burned in a blacksmith's forge, the bark turned its flames blue and could imbue a single weapon with [[enchantment]]s."
