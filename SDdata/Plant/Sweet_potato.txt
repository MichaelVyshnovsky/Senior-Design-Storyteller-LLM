'''Sweet potatoes''', also known as '''yams''', were common edible tubers found throughout [[Faer√ªn]]. Beloved for their versatility, sweet potatoes were often roasted, steamed, and candied.

==Description==
Sweet potatoes were oblong tubers, similar in size to regular [[potato]]es. Many yams that grew in the wild remained in the ground through the colder times of the year, serving as food for wild [[pig]]s and other foraging beasts. Humans learned to cultivate yams.

==Availability==
[[Sembia]]'s nobility often hunted wild [[boars]] in the winter as the beasts foraged for sweet potatoes left in the ground since fall.

The [[Inn of Seven Stars]] in [[Ormath]] served candied yams to its guests.

In [[Mezro]], sweet potatoes could always be found among many cultivated crops of the [[Agricultural Quarter]]. Chult was known for its species of sweet potatoes called koko-yams.

In [[Sams Bandar]], yams were part of the rich regional food culture.

Outside of [[Toril]], yams were cultivated in one of the [[Domains of Dread]], [[Markovia]].<ref>{{Cite book| author =  Adrew Cermak, John W.

==Usages==
Sembite boar hunters used to roast whole beasts who, in winter months, survived on a rich diet of sweet potatoes; as the beasts were roasted, the potatoes in their stomachs cooked as well. Yams were also used to stuff boar [[sausage]]s.

In Sams Bandar, many foods, including yams, were fried in [[palm]] [[oil]] or stewed in [[coconut]] milk. These dishes were traditionally accompanied by [[palm wine]].

Some chefs in the [[Western Heartlands]] were known to have prepared a dish of candied yams.
