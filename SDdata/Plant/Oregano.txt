Oregano was a fragrant plant of wide green leaves and light purple flowers used as a seasoning.
Oregano was sold as a common seasoning through Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue, priced at two silver pieces per ounce.
Oregano was grown in the lush herb gardens of the Sarahin fortress in the Haunted Lands of Zakhara. The aromas of mint, sage, rosemary, dill, parsley, cilantro, thyme, and oregano all clashed with each other and these were ready to be used in the fortresss nearby kitchens.
In the jungles of the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur oregano grew near Koshivan and Rudran settlements. The herb was also a known food consumed by the Ancient Nubari. One of the ancient recipes using oregano was discovered and turned into the Zucchini Saiyama style dish.
Some believed that oregano possessed some medicinal properties and received use as a germicide and a pain killer.
