'''Timothy''' was a grain-producing grass found in [[Faerûn]].

==Availability==
Timothy was cultivated for its grain in ancient [[Netheril]] alongside [[wheat]], [[spelt]], [[rye]], [[oat]]s, and [[bran]].

==Ecology==
Timothy plants were affected by the [[wheat rust]] blight, which destroyed the plants and their grains during the time of Netheril. The spreading disease was cured in {{yearlinkConvert|3165|NY}} by the [[arcanist]] [[Candlemas]], who used a complex combination of magics to produce a cure and save the crops.
