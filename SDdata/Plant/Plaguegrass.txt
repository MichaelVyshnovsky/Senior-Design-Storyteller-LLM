Plaguegrass was grass that had been touched by the Spellplague and which grew only within the borders of the Plaguewrought Land.	  
Plaguegrass had blue crystals growing on the stalks.
The grass was a key ingredient in an elixir that blocked the effects of spellscars and the Spellplague, such as was devised by the alchemist Gregor in the late 15 century DR.
