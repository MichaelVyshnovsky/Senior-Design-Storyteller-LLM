'''Bison-gourd''' was a flowering plant common on [[Pelleor's Prairie]] surrounding the [[Hill of Lost Souls]]. 

==Uses==
The oils harvested from this plant's seeds were hard to smell but could be used as a natural [[insect repellent]]. It should be noted that only normal-sized insects were repelled by the oil; larger insects or swarms were not affected in the least.  

==Description==
Bison-gourd covered large areas of the prairie with runners that were usually dozens of feet long. This plant produced large yellow flowers that were shaped like trumpets. The flowers produced a fruit that could grow up to {{SI|5|in|c|long=yes}} long.
