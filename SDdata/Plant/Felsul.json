        "Usage": "Fresh felsul wood could be eaten to decrease nausea and to numb the mouth and throat to enable eating and sleeping. Felsul wood did not burn well and was too weak to have much other use.\n\nFelsul flowers could be crushed to make an alluring, spicy perfume simply called [[felsul flower oil]]. An ounce of this perfume cost 100 [[gp]]. A sack of flowers could be sold for 5–30 [[sp]].\n\nFelsul root was sometimes used for small carvings, such as for [[holy symbol]]s, figurines, and toys.",
        "Habitats": "[[File:Black Hound loc20.png|thumb|''Felsul tree in the Market Square of [[White Ford]].'']]\nFelsuls were often found in cold, rocky places with poor soil. They could grow where no other tree could: in poor soil, on cliff sides, and in crags. \n* Felsuls were quite were common in [[northwest Faerûn]]. They were known to line the [[Laughingflow]] in the [[Evermoors]]..\n* Felsuls were also found in [[Adhe Wood]] in the [[Vast]].\n* In [[west Faerûn]]'s [[Western Heartlands]], felsuls could be found in the [[Cloak Wood]]."
