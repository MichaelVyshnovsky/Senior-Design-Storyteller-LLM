'''Sarsson''' was a type of plant native to wet tropical regions and warm volcanic subterranean areas.

==Description==
Sarsson was a common but little-known herb. It grew in fine carpets close to the ground, and its leaves were broad, short, and yellow. It was most commonly found in hot jungles, tropical riverbanks, warm bogs, and underground, nearby hot volcanic vents underground. It had a distinct [[pepper]]y-[[lemon]]y taste.

==Usage==
The strong taste of sarsson could be used to make foul water better tasting. However, it only affected its palatability but not food safety. As a seasoning, sarsson was used to complement meats. Certain species of carrion birds and related creatures, like [[giant strider]]s and [[gorcraw]]s found sarsson irresistible when mixed with fresh blood as it brought forth a vivid, strong taste beloved by them.
