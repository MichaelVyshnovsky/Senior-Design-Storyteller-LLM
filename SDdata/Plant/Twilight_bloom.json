        "mainbody": "The Twilight bloom, also known as a purple blossom plant or purple death, was a very rare species of poisonous plants.\nTwilight blooms largely bore a resemblance to palm trees. They had thick, scaled brown trunks that sprouted no branches and on average grew to heights of . The foliage at their tops were fronds that drooped a short distance. Their roots were visible on the surface around their base, resembling a fine mossy mat.\nWithin this the foliage tops of this plant grew purple, cup-shaped flowers with silver stamen. The sap of these flowers was very sweet and they exuded an attractive sent.\nTwilight blooms displayed no form of sentience or higher intelligence.\nDuring daylight hours, the flowers on a twilight bloom would be directed upwards towards the sun. During the night, they would close up completely.\nTwilight blooms would react to the vibrations caused by any creatures passing beneath it. Their flowers would gently tip over and drip down a small amount of poisonous sap. Most species of insect were immune to the effects of this poisonous sap, but were attracted to its scent. If harvested carefully, this poison could remain potent for a full day.\nThe twilight bloom reproduced in the same manner as most plant species.\nThe twilight bloom was a partially carnivorous species of plant. The decomposition of creatures killed by their sap served to fertilize their root network.\nTwilight blooms were typically found in swamps and areas with a temperate climate.\nIn the region of Kara-Tur, these plants were known to grow on the island of Akari. Particularly in the area around Opawangchicheng.\nTwilight blooms were a favored plant of the deity Sheela Peryroyl."
