        "mainbody": "Maidens milk was a common forest plant that possessed medicinal antitussive properties, found in the Wood of Sharp Teeth and the Western Heartlands.\nMaidens milk could be crushed and drank in a tea form to suppress cough by humanoids and dragons alike within minutes. Maidens milk looked similar to another plant â€“ bellows root, that possessed emetic properties.\nLong before the , maidens milk became a part of history when the logging camp of Hornhollow at the edge of Wood of Sharp Teeth was visited by a senile red dragon Craum Straug, whose dire caught lit the settlement ablaze. A traveling minstrel, Aznee Fraystrings, was tasked with removing the dragon and thought that he could prepare maidens milk tea to help the wyrm like it did help his elderly uncle once. Aznee, however, made a mistake and made a bellows root tea instead, causing the dragon to vomit the tea out along with his draconic flame breath, incinerating the minstrel instantly. This vomiting fit eventually killed the geriatric dragon."
