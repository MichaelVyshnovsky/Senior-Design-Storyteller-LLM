        "mainbody": "ukka trees, sometimes called wazingo trees, were a variety of magical tree that grew in the jungles of Chult.\nThe nuts of the wukka tree were the size of a human fist, Whenever one of these nuts was shaken, it made a rattling noise and began to glow with a bright, magical light for about one minute. This light was bright enough to illuminate everything within a  radius, at least dimly. Cracking a nut caused it to lose this property.\nWukka trees grew in groves and were considered to be rare in the Chultan jungle. A grove of them was known to grow along a stream at the foot of a hill just outside the ruins of Mezro.\nThey made excellent homes for jaculi, su-monsters, and zorbos."
