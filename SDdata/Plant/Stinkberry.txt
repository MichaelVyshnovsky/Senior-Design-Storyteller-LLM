Stinkberries were magical berries that grew in swamps and could be created via magic.
Stinkberries were small, hard, and wrinkled purple berries that exploded on impact with a stench similar to the effects of a stinking cloud spell that dispersed after 30 minutes. The berries emanated a faint aura of conjuration.
These berries were known to be used by kobold and goblin spellcasters, often throwing them at rival tribes.
Stinkberries were known to grow in wet and boggy areas such as the Lizard Marsh of the Sword Coast. Outside of Toril, stinkberries could be found on the world of Krynn.
Stinkberries could be created via magic by a capable crafter of wondrous items with the use of a stinking cloud spell. Each berry was valued at 750 gp.
In 1372 DR, the Green Hag of Lizard Marsh was gathering stinkberries, when lizardfolk sent by her bitter rival Uzzak-Szalzik burglarized her lair in the Lizard Marsh. The bandits stole a hairbrush that was a gift from the hags prodigal daughter and the clumps of hags hair from the brush were used to create an effigy.
*The Green Hag of Lizard Marsh used stinkberries along with other unsavory ingredients to brew her rich collection of magic potions, tinctures, and brews circa 1372 DR.
