'''Stinkberries''' were magical berries that grew in swamps and could be created via [[magic]].

==Description==
Stinkberries were small, hard, and wrinkled purple berries that exploded on impact with a stench similar to the effects of a ''[[stinking cloud]]'' spell that dispersed after 30 minutes. The berries emanated a faint aura of ''conjuration''.

These berries were known to be used by [[kobold]] and [[goblin]] spellcasters, often throwing them at rival tribes.

==Habitats==
Stinkberries were known to grow in wet and boggy areas such as the [[Lizard Marsh]] of the [[Sword Coast]]. Outside of [[Toril]], stinkberries could be found on the world of [[Krynn]].

==Creation==
Stinkberries could be created via magic by a capable crafter of wondrous items with the use of a ''stinking cloud'' spell. Each berry was valued at 750 [[gp]].{{Cite book| author =Â Cam Banks, Sean Macdonald, Clark Valentine, Trampas Whiteman| title = Dragonlance: Races of Ansalon| short_story = | date = 2007| editor = Christy Everette| publisher = Margaret Weis Productions, Ltd.| ISBN = | pages = 235}}

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], the [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]] was gathering stinkberries, when lizardfolk sent by her bitter rival [[Uzzak-Szalzik]] burglarized her lair in the Lizard Marsh. The bandits stole a hairbrush that was a gift from the [[hag]]'s prodigal daughter and the clumps of hag's hair from the brush were used to create an [[effigy]].

==Notable Users==
*The [[Green Hag of Lizard Marsh]] used stinkberries along with other unsavory ingredients to brew her rich collection of magic [[potion]]s, tinctures, and brews ''circa'' 1372 DR.
