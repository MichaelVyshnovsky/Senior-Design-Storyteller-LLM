'''Lantanese healing herbs''' were strange herbs from [[Lantan]] that possessed strong curative properties.

==Description==
Lantanese healing herbs were low-growing curious plants. Each of its leaves had a big fluid-filled bladder on top, weighting around {{SI|0.3|lb|k|long=yes}}. The liquid was a healing juice that could be easily extracted by rolling the leaf. Each bladder had curative wipers on par with the ''[[cure moderate wounds]]'' [[spell]].

==Availability==
Not surprisingly, Lantanese healing herbs originated from the island of [[Lantan]]. There, the strange plant was cultivated for its medicinal properties. The plant later was brought to an illegal Lantanese [[gnome]] logging camp in the jungles of [[Samarach]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]]. The herb plants quickly spread throughout the area surrounding the camp by the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.
