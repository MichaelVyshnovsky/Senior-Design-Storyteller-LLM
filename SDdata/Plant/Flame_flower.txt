'''Flame flowers''' were a rare [[plant]] native to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].

==Description==
These flowers were composed entirely of fire, and appeared and glowed much like individual flames.

==Ecology==
Flame flowers propagated their seeds by exploding in a burst of fire. Touching a flame flower with anything other than fire could trigger this blast, which could be dangerous for creatures within a {{SIAdj|7.5|foot|long=yes|adj=radius}}.

They grew best in cooled lava.

==History==
A garden known as the [[Flaming Brazier#Great Pyramid|Hall of Flame Flowers]] was carefully cultivated in the catacombs beneath the [[Flaming Brazier]]&mdash;the grand temple to [[Kossuth]] within the city of [[Bezantur]], [[Thay]]&mdash;as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Located in a large chamber beneath the temple's Inner Sanctum, the meandering paths and thousands of flame flowers offered a serene place for meditation.

Flame flower motifs were sometimes used to decorate [[wizard]] [[robe]]s. [[Chevesh]] of [[Airspur]] wore such decoration as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite digital book/Sword of the Gods||8}}
