Arrowroot, known as nduma in the Chultan language, was a starchy plant found in Chult.
It was one of the few starch-based plants that was able to thrive in the extremely rainy Chultan climate. Some could grow to enormous size, becoming giant arrowroots.
Arrowroot was used as bait by hunters in Chult to lure great apes.
In alchemy, arrowroot (as well as carrot, jimsonweed, and sesame) was a key ingredient in powders designed to provide the user with night vision (comparable to that of a cat). Arrowroot was also used to make cosmetics, namely eyeshadow, such as was favored by Nerys Kathon of Baldurs Gate.
In the late 15 century DR, particularly enormous arrowroots could sell for more than 4 silver pieces in Port Nyanzaru. At that time, the hunter Desha of the Shadows devised a plan to use such a giant arrowroot as a lure to hunt a massive ape known as Gigantopithecus, which was said to dwell in the lost city of Omu deep within the Chultan jungle.
It was said that among some monastic traditions, arrowroot represented the power of healing, and some monks were said to have magical tattoos depicting these plants.
