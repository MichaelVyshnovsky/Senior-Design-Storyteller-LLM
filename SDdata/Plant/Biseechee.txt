'''Biseechee''' were a type of berry-producing bush native to the [[Malatran Plateau]].

==Description==
The biseechee was a short bush with slender branches, whose stems were covered with tiny thorns similar to that of a [[cactus]]. They grew four-petal flowers that were delicate and white in color.

==Abilities==
The berries that grew on this bush had incredible healing properties, but once plucked from the biseechee this property remained in them for only the period of a single day.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Biseechee grew in dry soil, near the edges of the [[Rayanna Savannah]] of the Malatran Plateau.

===Relationships===
Many of the [[Nubari]] believed that these bushes were a gift to them from the [[Nubari (ancient)|ancients]].
