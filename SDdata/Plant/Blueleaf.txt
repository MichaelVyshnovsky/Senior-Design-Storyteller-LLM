A '''blueleaf''' ({{Plural|blueleafs|refs= '''Bluewood''' was the name of the wood taken from this tree.

==Description== 
The tree resembled a large [[maple]]. It was so named for the color of its leaves, which were a strange, gleaming blue and had many points. They actually glowed with a faint, blue light.

Blueleafs often grew in thick copses and typically reached heights of 40 feet (12 meters), but their trunks rarely grew thick. The wood of the tree was surprisingly durable; the relatively thin trunk rarely broke, even when under extreme stress. They bent in winds and under snows, and in winter they could stabilize snow tunnels over roads that sheltered travelers.

==Usage==

Blueleaf leaves and sap could be crushed to make a bright blue dye often used in clothing manufacture in the [[North]], usually in [[cloak]]s. The leaves and wood could also be burned to produce vivid, jumping blue flames that were favored by minstrels and storytellers for special effects, such as mood lighting during sad scenes.

The wood of the blueleaf tree, known as bluewood, was used by [[Volodni]] craftsfolk to make weapons and armor. Bluewood was magically treated to become as hard as steel, though it weighed half as much.

* Blueleafs were often found north of [[Amn]], in humid, temperate, and subarctic latitudes.Although [[The Shining South (1993)|''The Shining South'' (1993)]] states that the [[Forest of Amtar]] was primarily blueleaf trees, this was [[wikipedia:en:retcon|retconned]] to be [[suth]] trees in ''[[Shining South (sourcebook)|Shining South (2004)]]''.

* In the [[Nelanther Isles]], these trees grew in the southern section of the pair of islets known as [[the Tusks]].
* The [[Vast Swamp]], with stunted bluelead trees growing around the fringe.
* The [[Shadow Swamp]] (a reflection of the Vast Swamp) in the [[Plane of Shadow]], around the [[Shadow Citadel]].

==Trivia==
A blueleaf tree was the location of a ''[[portal]]'' between [[Eveningstar]] and [[Suzail]].
