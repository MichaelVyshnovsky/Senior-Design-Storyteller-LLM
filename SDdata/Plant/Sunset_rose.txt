The '''sunset rose''' was a flowering plant that grew in the [[Rose Garden]] of the [[Battle of Bones]].

==Description==
As the name implied, this plant's flowers were yellow, orange, and red. The flowers had dark stems and large thorns. The jagged-edged leaves made this plant dangerous as they could cut exposed flesh easily.

==Uses==
The leaves of sunset roses were poisonous. A cut from one delivered a potent [[sleep poison]] that would knock a victim unconscious for hours. A high dosage could prevent the victim from breathing.
