The sunset rose was a flowering plant that grew in the Rose Garden of the Battle of Bones.
As the name implied, this plants flowers were yellow, orange, and red. The flowers had dark stems and large thorns. The jagged-edged leaves made this plant dangerous as they could cut exposed flesh easily.
The leaves of sunset roses were poisonous. A cut from one delivered a potent sleep poison that would knock a victim unconscious for hours. A high dosage could prevent the victim from breathing.
