        "mainbody": "Sarsson was a type of plant native to wet tropical regions and warm volcanic subterranean areas.\nSarsson was a common but little-known herb. It grew in fine carpets close to the ground, and its leaves were broad, short, and yellow. It was most commonly found in hot jungles, tropical riverbanks, warm bogs, and underground, nearby hot volcanic vents underground. It had a distinct peppery-lemony taste.\nThe strong taste of sarsson could be used to make foul water better tasting. However, it only affected its palatability but not food safety. As a seasoning, sarsson was used to complement meats. Certain species of carrion birds and related creatures, like giant striders and gorcraws found sarsson irresistible when mixed with fresh blood as it brought forth a vivid, strong taste beloved by them."
