{{wikipedia article|Nettle}}
'''Nettle''' was a common edible plant found in the outskirts of [[Neverwinter]] and the [[Sword Coast North]] that possessed curative properties and could be used as a [[material component]].

==Description==
Nettle was known for its tiny "hairs" that covered the plant and upon contact with unprotected skin caused it to itch, sting, and burn.

When eaten raw, nettle tasted very bitter, and its notorious burning could be equated to hot [[pepper]]s.

==Usage==
Stinging nettle could be used to prepare ''[[workman's balm]]'', and, when mixed with [[aegwyrt]], ''[[workman's poultice]]''. Both topical curative substances were often used by the folk of the trade to aid them in their daily work.

When treated and prepared correctly, nettle plant could be used to create ''[[Potion of healing|potions of minor healing]]''.

Before the [[Time of Troubles]], stinging nettle was a component of the ''[[repel vermin]]'' [[spell]].

Nettle was a natural counter-agent to magical and mundane ''[[sleep]]''. The plant's natural bitterness and burning irritation staved off the drowsiness and stopped the chewer from falling asleep, even though they still felt drowsy. The [[gnome]] [[Madarn Spiderhunter]] recommended it for those afflicted with ''sleep'' when they approached the tower of [[Gothyl]] in [[Spiderhaunt Wood]], and gathered leaves in the forest for this purpose.

[[Golden Sands Brews|Golden Sands Gold]] brew was produced by fortifying regular Golden Sands [[beer|lager]] with nettle and cactus extracts, giving its its titular color and notably bitter aftertaste.

Nettle was used by priests of [[Ilmater]] and [[Loviatar]]. One of the techniques used by the followers of Ilmater was stuffing their undergarments with nettle.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190916071832/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_080910-04.htm| title = Ed Greenwood on Candlekeep | accessdate = 12-01-2020| date = 12-01-2020}} Priestesses of Loviatar used nettle for self-flagellation.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210112230714/http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=12179&whichpage=2| title = Ed Greenwood on Candlekeep | accessdate = 12-01-2020| date = 12-01-2020}}

Wild nettle grew on the [[Malatran Plateau]] in [[Kara-Tur]] where it was used to brew [[nettle beer]] or cooked down into [[nettle soup]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/A Gathering of Heroes Interactive}}

==Availability==
*''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' made nettle available throughout the [[Realms]], selling it in its [[Priest]]'s Alcove section.

*In [[Neverwinter]], late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Bolden Coarsca]] of the [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]] sold nettle, along many other herbs, materials, and substances used in crafting.

*The [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] was notorious for its overgrown nettles and [[thornbush]]es.
