        "Habitats": "* In [[north Faer√ªn]], pigweeds were known to grow in [[Cormanthor]].\n* In [[Maztica]], pigweeds were known to grow in the [[Pasocada Basin]].",
        "Usages": "In Maztica, pigweed was treated as a vegetable by the native [[Azuposi]] and was a common part of their diet.",
        "History": "At some point in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of [[ranger]]s introduced giant wasps into the [[Rimwood]] of Cormanthor. Their intention was to hopefully drive out the area's [[fyrefly]] population by having the giant wasps compete with them for their precious cornflower pollen. However, this proved to be unsuccessful as the fyreflies adapted to eating [[quack grass]] and dried pigweed."
