'''Maiden's milk''' was a common forest plant that possessed medicinal antitussive properties, found in the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]] and the [[Western Heartlands]].

==Description==
''Maiden's milk'' could be crushed and drank in a [[tea]] form to suppress cough by [[humanoid]]s and [[dragon]]s alike within minutes. Maiden's milk looked similar to another plant â€“ [[bellows root]], that possessed emetic properties.

==History==
Long before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, maiden's milk became a part of history when the logging camp of [[Hornhollow]] at the edge of Wood of Sharp Teeth was visited by a senile [[red dragon]] [[Craum Straug]], whose dire caught lit the settlement ablaze. A traveling [[minstrel]], [[Aznee Fraystrings]], was tasked with removing the dragon and thought that he could prepare maiden's milk tea to help the wyrm like it did help his elderly uncle once. Aznee, however, made a mistake and made a bellows root tea instead, causing the dragon to vomit the tea out along with his draconic flame breath, incinerating the minstrel instantly. This vomiting fit eventually killed the geriatric dragon.
