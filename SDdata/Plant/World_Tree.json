        "mainbody": "The '''World Tree''' was a sentient tree-like cosmic structure in the [[World Tree cosmology]] model that connected all of the [[Celestial plane]]s to each other.",
        "Cosmography": "The World Tree's roots were located in [[Dwarfhome]] and [[Arvandor]], its lower branches in [[Green Fields]], the [[House of the Triad]] and [[Dweomerheart]], its main trunk along the [[House of Knowledge]], [[Golden Hills]] and [[Brightwater]], and at the top were the [[Gates of the Moon]].\n\nNormal planar travel used the [[Astral plane]] to pass from the [[Prime Material Plane]] to one of the other [[Outer planes]] and all inter-planar journeys had to pass through the Prime Material nexus. [[Angel]]ic servants of the good [[deity|deities]] used the tree as a kind of \"celestial ladder\" to avoid having to go through the Prime Material plane, although the tree did not enjoy being used as such.",
        "Inhabitants": "Mortal travelers would often meet [[Celestial creature|celestial]] [[treant]]s and [[dryad]]s sent to prevent their passage. However, if their intentions were noble enough the tree usually allowed them to pass unhindered.",
        "History": "The World Tree was destroyed in {{Yearlink|1385}} by the [[Spellplague]].<ref>"
