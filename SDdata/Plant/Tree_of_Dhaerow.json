        "mainbody": "The Tree of Dhaerow was a dead tree on a hilltop in the Yuirwood. The word dhaerow was Elven for \"traitor\", and the etymological precursor to \"drow\".\nThe trees leafless trunk was hard and gray. It shuddered with the wind during storms, and had a foul atmosphere around it.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Masters of the Yuirwood hung their vilest criminals on it.  The assassin Kheil was hung and flayed on the Tree of Dhaerow before being revived, retrained, and renamed by Chereth."
