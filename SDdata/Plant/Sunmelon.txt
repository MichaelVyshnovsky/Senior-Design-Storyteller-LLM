'''Sunmelons''', also known as '''watermelons''', were sweet and succulent fruits that grew on vines and were cultivated in many lands throughout the Realms.

==Description==
Sunmelons found in the north were known for their succulent and refreshingly sweet flesh encased in a green striped skin. The fruit grew on vines and ripened on the ground. They often were simply eaten raw, and sometimes pickled or jellied.

The type of sunmelon cultivated in the [[Vilhon Reach]], however, was different. The similarly sweet fruit was golden in color and encased in golden skin. The melon was fleshier than its northern cousin and the mouthfeel of Vilhon sunmelons was gentle, as if the fruit melted on the tongue.

[[Deepingdale]], in the [[Dalelands]], was a perfect place for growing sunmelons and [[pumpkin]]s. With the region's decline, the watermelons that grew there became smaller, about the size of a [[sweet potato]].

Sunmelons were cultivated in [[Delimbiyr Vale]] and [[Chionthar Valley]], and were one of the regions' trade goods.

In the exotic-goods markets of [[Calimshan]], sunmelons were a common sight.

In the [[Blade Kingdoms]], wild watermelon could be foraged by hungry travelers and adventures on the road.

In [[Sembia]], sunmelon rind was a food found in taverns and served along with many other small bite-sized treats.
