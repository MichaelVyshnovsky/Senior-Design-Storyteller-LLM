'''Woad''' was a flowering plant found in the jungles of [[Chult]] in [[southwest Faerûn]].

==Usages==
Leaves of the woad plant were used in the creation of common Chultan blue and emerald [[dye]]s. Another use for woad plants was [[workman's oil]]. Woad leaves were infused with Chultan [[tea]], [[senna]], and spring water to produce a pleasant tasting curative drink that alleviated several common afflictions.

Some [[Thay]]an women used blue woad dye to [[tattoo]] their heads with. One such person with decorative blue tattoos was [[Dahlia Sin'felle]], a one-time servant of [[Szass Tam]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
