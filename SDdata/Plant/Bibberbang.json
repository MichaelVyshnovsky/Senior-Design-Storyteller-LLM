        "mainbody": "'''Bibberbangs''' were one of several highly dangerous growths found in the [[Underdark]]. When a person drew too near, they would swell and if they went closer still or touched or attacked them, they would explode violently. Often, they grew in large clusters, so disturbing one could cause a highly destructive chain of explosions.\n\nAfter exploding, bibberbangs left behind noxious clouds of [[poison]] that would linger for some time."
