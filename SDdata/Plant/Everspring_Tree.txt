The Everspring Tree was a gargantuan tree in Icewind Dale.
This huge tree was several times taller than a typical humanoid. Its brown-green bark appeared to have sections where it glowed light blue. The roots of the Everspring Tree seemed to have forced their way out of the hard, stony ground.
It is unknown when the Everspring Tree began to grow or first spawned, but its existence was first noted in the mid 14 century DR. The Everspring Tree became corrupted by the powerful magic of crystal cultists, and trapped the Spirit of the Forest within its vast roots.
