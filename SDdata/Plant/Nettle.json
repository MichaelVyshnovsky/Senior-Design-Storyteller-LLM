        "mainbody": "century DR23 cp in late 15 century DR\nNettle was a common edible plant found in the outskirts of Neverwinter and the Sword Coast North that possessed curative properties and could be used as a material component.\nNettle was known for its tiny \"hairs\" that covered the plant and upon contact with unprotected skin caused it to itch, sting, and burn.\nWhen eaten raw, nettle tasted very bitter, and its notorious burning could be equated to hot peppers.\nStinging nettle could be used to prepare workmans balm, and, when mixed with aegwyrt, workmans poultice. Both topical curative substances were often used by the folk of the trade to aid them in their daily work.\nWhen treated and prepared correctly, nettle plant could be used to create potions of minor healing.\nBefore the Time of Troubles, stinging nettle was a component of the repel vermin spell.\nNettle was a natural counter-agent to magical and mundane sleep. The plants natural bitterness and burning irritation staved off the drowsiness and stopped the chewer from falling asleep, even though they still felt drowsy. The gnome Madarn Spiderhunter recommended it for those afflicted with sleep when they approached the tower of Gothyl in Spiderhaunt Wood, and gathered leaves in the forest for this purpose.\nGolden Sands Gold brew was produced by fortifying regular Golden Sands lager with nettle and cactus extracts, giving its its titular color and notably bitter aftertaste.\nNettle was used by priests of Ilmater and Loviatar. One of the techniques used by the followers of Ilmater was stuffing their undergarments with nettle. Priestesses of Loviatar used nettle for self-flagellation.\nWild nettle grew on the Malatran Plateau in Kara-Tur where it was used to brew nettle beer or cooked down into nettle soup.\n*Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue made nettle available throughout the Realms, selling it in its Priests Alcove section.\n*In Neverwinter, late 15 century DR, Bolden Coarsca of the Seven Suns Trading Coster sold nettle, along many other herbs, materials, and substances used in crafting.\n*The Wood of Sharp Teeth in the Western Heartlands was notorious for its overgrown nettles and thornbushes."
