'''Bronzewood''' was a type of hardwood tree that was found in the land of [[Chult]].

==Description==
As a crafting material, bronzewood was said to be comparable to some metals in its durability and strength while only having a portion of the weight.

==Habitats==
* In Chult, along the banks of the [[River Soshenstar]].

==Varieties==
''Living bronzewood'' was unique variety of the hardwood that had been magically brought back to life. This was achieved by treating the finished wood with some ''[[tear of Ubtao]]'', sap that was drawn from a unique tree found within the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]].

==Usage==
Bronzewood was favored for its exceptional hardness compared to other woods. Craftspeople often used it to fashion handles for tools such as [[hammer]]s, [[scythe]]s, [[machete]]s, [[pick]]axes, and even [[arrow]]s. When treated with resin made from [[lakh]] insects, bronzewood could be hardened ever further and used in the crafting of weapons like [[dagger]]s, [[axe]]s, and [[sword]]s.

==History==
Although it was not native to the region, the [[elves]] of [[Iliyanbruen]] were known to use bronzewood in the creation of their musical instruments.
