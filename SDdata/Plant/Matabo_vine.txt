'''Matabo vines''' were carnivorous plants that grew in the jungles of [[Chult]].{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|26}}

==Description==
Matabo vines were semi-sentient and covered in [[poison]]ous barbs.{{Cite adventurers league/A City on the Edge|18}} Creatures that came within {{SI|10|feet|long=yes}} of matabo vines found the plants lashing out at them, attempting to restrain and poison them in order to "drink" their blood.

==Ecology==
The matabo were found in dense patches that grew up and around the trunks of trees and could contain hundreds of vines. These could be difficult to spot on the jungle floor, although their presence could be recognized by the fact that they left their host trees looking sickly.

===Uses===
Some gladiatorial events in the [[Grand Coliseum]] of [[Port Nyanzaru]] were made more deadly by setting them inside cages covered in matabo vines.

==History==
During the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], matabo vines could be found growing on the jungled ridge at the furthest edge of the [[Malar's Throat]] ward of Port Nyanzaru.
