Bilberries were a species of blueberry endemic to both the High Moor region and the Serpent Hills.
The fruit of bilberries grew on short, brittle branches with small round leaves. Their bushs tended to form dense, interwoven thickets that made it challenging to retrieve these berries.
Said to be very palatable, the berries of this shrub were a staple in the diet of many animals that inhabited the High Moor plateau. With even humans and goblinkin known to forage for them.
Some used bilberry in the treatment of certain medical conditions, such as dropsy and typhoid.
