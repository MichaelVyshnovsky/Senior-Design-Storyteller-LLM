        "mainbody": "Stinkweeds were a type of foul-smelling weed.\nRubbing large amounts of stinkweed on ones body could cause an effect similar to stinking cloud, knocking them out for one to four minutes.\nStinkweeds could be found in the elven forest of Cormanthor, north Faer√ªn, as well as in the Lizard Marsh on the Sword Coast.\nOutside of the Prime Material plane, stinkweed grew in the plane of Baator, the swamps of the plane of Othrys,\nSome hags used stinkweeds as potion ingredients.\nOn the plane of Othrys, people were known to protect themselves against insects by rubbing stinkweed on their bodies. On the plane of Baator, stinkweeds were often consumed by grazing herds of stench kine.\n*The Green Hag of Lizard Marsh used stingkeeds along with other unsavory ingredients to brew her rich collection of magic potions, tinctures, and brews circa 1372 DR."
