        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and his companions traveled to the [[Abyss]] and stole the ''[[Wand of Orcus]]'' using advice from [[Saint Sollars]]. The [[Platinum dragon]] [[Bahamut]] then directed them to the only method of its destruction, which was to immerse the wand in the black blood of the heart of an [[avatar]] of [[Tiamat]].\n\nAfter they destroyed the wand, its heart was left behind in the form of a small white gem.<ref name=TToB-1> Bahamut gave it to Gareth as a sign of his covenant with him to protect Damara from [[demon]] attacks. The gem was planted in the courtyard of Palace Dragonsbane in Bloodstone Village and grew into a tall white tree with golden leaves.<ref name=TToB-1/>\n\nThe Tree-Gem brought renewed interest from non-dragons in the worship of Bahamut as a god.\n\nBy [[1480 DR]], a decade after [[Vaasa]] and the [[Warlock Knights]] conquered [[Bloodstone Pass]], the tree still stood outside the ruins of Bloodstone Village, but it had become petrified and lifeless.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}",
