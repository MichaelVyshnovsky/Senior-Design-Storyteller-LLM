The '''Red Tree''' was a large [[aspen]] tree and prominent landmark found within [[Immil Vale]] in [[Rashemen]].

{{quote|''Chauntea, Great Mother of the Land, divine warden of all that grows, know that the [[Ashenwood]] is stricken with a
powerful blight. Grant me your blessing, that I might reverse the damage it has wrought.''|[[Kalach-Cha]]'s prayer to [[Chauntea]] upon the Red Tree.}}

==Description==
Half of the Red Tree's leaves constantly changed colors as if it were autumn.

==Activities==
[[Imsha]] and [[Tamlith]], who were a pair of [[telthor]] [[hathran]]s, were tied to the Red Tree. They imparted advice to [[wychlaran]], provided the questions regarded Rashemen's security.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Ashenwood became afflicted by a mysterious blight that started withering trees and drove [[treant]]s berserk. The hero known as Kalach-Cha witnessed the blight firsthand when the group arrived at the frost in search of the [[Wood Man]], a nature spirit and forest guardian. In attempts to cure the outbreak, Kalach-Cha resorted to asking the goddess Chauntea for aid through anointing in a sacred brew and praying at the base of the Red Tree. The goddess responded and let the heroes know with a wave of warmth that radiated from the tree and penetrated the adventurers' bodies, sating the Spirit-Eater's hunger for a blissful moment.
