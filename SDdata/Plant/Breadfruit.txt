==Description ==
Exotic breadfruit was known for its doughy flesh, hidden under tough bumpy green skin. It tasted bland but was surprisingly rich on nutrients.

==Availability==
On the Nelanther Islands, also known as Pirate Isles of the [[Sea of Swords]], breadfruit trees were plentiful, often providing castaways and survivors of shipwrecks washed ashore with life-saving source of food.

In Calimshan a crossbreed species of breadfruit and [[date]] existed and was called "palintrike".

Like many other exotic foodstuffs, breadfruits were imported and sold in [[Waterdeep]] by some of the more adventurous and knowledgeable vendors.

==Usage==
Breadfruit main use was food. The simplest way of preparing it was boiling shelled and sliced flesh and pummeling it into mash.{{Cite dragon/130/Shark-killer|45}}
