'''Quace''' was a natural vine found in the hills of [[South Faerûn|southern]] and [[Southeast Faerûn|southeastern]] Faerûn that clung to the ground and other surfaces. It was also the name of the edible [[lime]]-like fruit produced by this plant.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|47-48}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 39: Delzemaeran Delicacies, Part 1}}{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190321004357/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Nov – Dec 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==Description==
Quace was a vine that preferred hilly terrain with plenty of sunlight and water. It would grow to cover most horizontal surfaces that it could easily reach. The leaves were broad with irregularly serrated edges and sprouted in clusters that shaded the fruit.

The fruit of the quace started out as a bulb with a light pink hue riddled with veins of a light green color. As it matured, the fruit formed a squat [[melon]] around the central stem that was noticeably segmented<ref group="note">Similar to a [[wikipedia:en:Kabocha|kabocha]] squash or flattened pumpkin. as it turned completely green with slightly darker green veins. Mature fruit ranged in diameter from the size of a large [[human]]'s palm to head-sized, but rarely grew more than six inches (fifteen centimeters) tall.

In times of drought, the leaves curled inward and turned yellow while the fruit shrunk and turned brown or dark purple. But quace was a hardy plant and both leaves and fruit would quickly return to health if water again became available before the plant died.

==Uses==
Cutting the fruit open revealed a thick, [[wax]]y rind that was quite tough and inedible surrounding a soft, green flesh with the consistency of jelly with a strong acidic taste. If crushed, a quace produced a good amount of syrup. Quace flesh could be eaten raw and was thirst-quenching, with a taste like sharp [[cheese]] with a sweet finish.

In addition to being eaten raw, the edible flesh could be fried (usually still attached to the rind, which was then discarded), or [[pickle]]d to preserve it from spoiling. Quace absorbed the flavor of whatever [[oil]] and [[spices]] were used in frying. Pickled quace could be flavored in myriad ways, from sweet, to salty, to smoky, to savory.

The vines of the quace plant were brittle enough to be broken by hand and therefore not appropriate as a substitute for [[rope]] or [[twine]].

==Culture==
In the hills around [[Delzimmer]], quace was plentiful when in season and many poor folk and some children took [[handcart]]s and [[wheelbarrow]]s outside the city and returned within an hour or two with a full load of fruit. A brace of sixteen quace was called a "qrey" and typically sold for a [[copper piece]]. Half that amount was known as a "qro".

Many people (about a third to a fourth of the adult population) in Delzimmer, particularly the elderly, had one or more secret recipes for cooking or pickling quace with unique flavors, from [[mint]]y sweet to smoked [[eel]] and everything in between. They would prepare these and sell them out of a window in their dwelling or to street vendors to resell elsewhere.
