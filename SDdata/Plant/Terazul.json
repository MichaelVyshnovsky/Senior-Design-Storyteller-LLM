        "mainbody": "erazul was a flowering plant found only in a few locations in the jungles south of Delzimmer. It was also the name of a somewhat addictive drug made from the leaves of the plant.\nWhen ground into a powder and snorted, the drug was a powerful stimulant, causing the user to remain awake for days at a time. When drunk as a potion it caused visions.\nThe plants properties were thought to be due to its ability to tap into lingering pockets of spellplague. In reality, the plants roots grew out of portals to the Far Realm, which had been opened by derro in the Underdark.\nThe terazul trade was controlled by House Serrat of Delzimmer.\nIn the , a group led by Alaia Serrat and her adopted daughter Zaltys closed the portal to the Far Realm, destroying the terazul plants.\nIn the late 15 century DR, members of the Guild worked with smugglers who brought drugs, weapons, firewine, and other substances into Baldurs Gate. Pouches of  terazul were among such illicit goods.\nCategoryIntoxicating substances\nCategoryVegetation\nCategoryFlowers\nCategoryDrugs\nCategoryPlants\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from South Faerûn\nCategoryItems from West Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Delzimmer\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems from the Western Heartlands\nCategoryItems from the Sword Coast\nCategoryItems from Baldurs Gate\n3vouvb1k3huh6wf0ox2q65h31ncqs0k"
