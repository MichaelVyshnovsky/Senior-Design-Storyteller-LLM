Karmak trees were a type of tree found growing in a few isolated groves in the Winto Forest in the Bashan Do Province of Tu Lung.
Karmaks were viewed as almost useless because their wood warped after curing and was heavy with an oily sap. A key exception was their use in producing flame eggs. The sap needed to be refined and distilled into a fine oil, with a more pure oil resulting in more effective eggs.
