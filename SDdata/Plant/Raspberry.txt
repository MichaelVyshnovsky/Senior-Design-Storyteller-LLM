'''Raspberries''' were a common type of wild berry in the Realms.

{{quote|''I know some people who won't eat raspberries because of the little seeds, but that's as silly as not eating [[fish]] because of the bones. The really good foods always have little annoying things like seeds and bones. Like life, I guess. Of course, [[bread]] doesn't have seeds or bones. But I do like bread.''|[[Emilo Haversack]]}}

==Description==
Raspberries grew on bushes that had long, [[whip]]-like and wiry branches known as canes. The berries were filled with juice that bursted out and stained finger with a slightest hint of pressure and it tasted tart-sweet.

==Habitats==

==History==
The existence of raspberries on [[Toril]] dated all the way back to the days of [[Netheril]].

In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], a farmer from Thunderstone named [[Del Geery]] used the dried skin of a [[hydra]] to make coverings for his raspberry, [[blueberry]], and [[strawberry]] bushes. This covering kept the air around them at a cool {{SI|70|F|long=yes}}, extending their growing period deep into autumn. The hydra hides proved to be effective only on these three types of berry bush.

During that same century, ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold bundles of twenty-five raspberry leaves, as well as brandied raspberries and raspberry preserves.
