A '''rosecork''' was a type of [[tree]] found in [[Faer√ªn]].

Rosecork wood was durable and extremely resistant to fire. It absorbed such a great concentration of water that open flames could not ignite it, short of exposure to a very hot flame for some hours. For these properties, it was commonly used in construction.

The rosecork was native to the Isle of [[Prespur]] in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], and was used to these warmer climes. However, [[Sarliman Eurdoe]], an entrepreneur of [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]], imported the rosecork for its valuable properties and the trees went on to flourish by the southern tributaries of the [[Wyvernflow]]. [[Bryn Ohme Thornwood]] mentioned the rosecork as an example of an introduced plant species that had no significant impact on the existing environment.

==Locations==
Rosecork trees were found growing in the following places:
* Isle of [[Prespur]], [[Inner Sea]].
