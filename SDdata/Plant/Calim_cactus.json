        "mainbody": "Calim cacti were small, sharp-thorned cacti native to the Calim Desert that grew to between three and four inches tall. However, they had vast root systems that spread out over nearly a dozen square feet under the surface. These roots often poked through the surface and absorbed moisture from the air. They could live in different types of soil, from hard to sandy, and grew very quickly. It was said that they could even shift positions overnight."
