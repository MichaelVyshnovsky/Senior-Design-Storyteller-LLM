The '''thelmallow''' was a flowering plant that grew as floating blossoms in swamps and marshes. The plant produced large, ragged white flowers, which were usually inhabited by swamp flies. The plant's only known use was as an ingredient in [[spellslayer wine]].{{Cite dungeon/195/Eye on the Realms: Spellslayer Wine}}
