Firefruit, or amberglow, was a sweet berry that grew every three to four years on certain species of flowering mosses and lichens in North Faer√ªn.
When
seen, protruding from hair-thin stalks out of the scabrous fungi, they can be eaten with surety,
because theres nothing poisonous or inedible that looks like firefruit.
Firefruits were small, tough-skinned berries with their centers filled with gooey and sweet like honey flesh. These berries grew on hair-thin stalks. Most mosses and lichens in the Savage Frontier never flowered, and it took the most experienced rangers and expert foresters to know how to identify the berry-bearing vegetation. However, when found, amberglow could be eaten without any reservations as the berries were edible and there were no poisonous berries that could be mistaken for them.
