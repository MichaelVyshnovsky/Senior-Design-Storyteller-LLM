'''Firefruit''', or '''amberglow''', was a sweet berry that grew every three to four years on certain species of flowering [[moss]]es and lichens in [[North Faerûn]].

When
seen, protruding from hair-thin stalks out of the scabrous fungi, they can be eaten with surety,
because there's nothing poisonous or inedible that looks like firefruit.

==Description==
Firefruits were small, tough-skinned berries with their centers filled with gooey and sweet like [[honey]] flesh. These berries grew on hair-thin stalks. Most mosses and lichens in the [[Savage Frontier]] never flowered, and it took the most experienced [[ranger]]s and expert foresters to know how to identify the berry-bearing vegetation. However, when found, amberglow could be eaten without any reservations as the berries were edible and there were no [[poison]]ous berries that could be mistaken for them.
