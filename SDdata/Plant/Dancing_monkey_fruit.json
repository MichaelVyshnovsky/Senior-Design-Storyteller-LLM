        "mainbody": "'''Dancing monkey fruit''' was a variety of [[magic]]al [[:Category:Fruits|fruit]] that could be found in the jungles of [[Chult]].",
        "Description": "The fruit and its juice were [[poison]]ous. The most notable effect of this poison was that it could cause [[humanoid]]s to immediately begin moving around in what looked like a comical dance. An afflicted individual was unable to perform any movements save for this forced \"dance\", which could last up to a minute without any intervention. Even after the dancing subsided, the ingested fruit left afflicted individuals feeling sick for an hour.\n\nEach fruit contained enough juice to fill a [[vial]].",
        "Ecology": {
            "Uses": "Dancing monkey fruit could be used to make [[dye]]s for [[textile]]s, and was used at the [[dye works (Port Nyanzaru)|dye works]] in [[Port Nyanzaru]]'s [[Port Nyanzaru/Market Ward|Market Ward]]."
        },
        "History": "Dancing monkey fruit trees were grown in the gardens of [[Nangalore]].\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the sale of dancing monkey fruit in Port Nyanzaru (along with the sale of any other fruits in that city) was presided over by the [[merchant prince]] [[Kwayothé]]. Any dancing monkey fruit sold without her oversight was considered to be contraband, and buying such fruit (or using it to produce dyes) could see a person sentenced to [[Executioner's Run]] by Kwayothé and the [[Ytepka Society]]."
