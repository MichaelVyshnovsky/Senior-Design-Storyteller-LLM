        "mainbody": "Dancing monkey fruit was a variety of magical fruit that could be found in the jungles of Chult.\nThe fruit and its juice were poisonous. The most notable effect of this poison was that it could cause humanoids to immediately begin moving around in what looked like a comical dance. An afflicted individual was unable to perform any movements save for this forced \"dance\", which could last up to a minute without any intervention. Even after the dancing subsided, the ingested fruit left afflicted individuals feeling sick for an hour.\nEach fruit contained enough juice to fill a vial.\nDancing monkey fruit was found in the Chultan wilderness, although it was rare. It grew on trees, with each tree usually bearing as many as a dozen fruits at a time. Flying monkeys were known to sit in such trees and throw the fruit at explorers in the jungle.\nDancing monkey fruit could be used to make dyes for textiles, and was used at the dye works in Port Nyanzarus Market Ward.\nDancing monkey fruit trees were grown in the gardens of Nangalore.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, the sale of dancing monkey fruit in Port Nyanzaru (along with the sale of any other fruits in that city) was presided over by the merchant prince Kwayothé. Any dancing monkey fruit sold without her oversight was considered to be contraband, and buying such fruit (or using it to produce dyes) could see a person sentenced to Executioners Run by Kwayothé and the Ytepka Society."
