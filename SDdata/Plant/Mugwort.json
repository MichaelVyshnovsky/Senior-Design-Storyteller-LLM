        "mainbody": "'''Mugwort''' was a common fast-growing weed often disliked by farmers and gardeners, but useful to [[druid]]s and [[potion]]-makers. Mugwort plants often grew back within mere days after being cut.",
        "Availability": "In the [[Western Heartlands]], mugwort was a common plant. It was used by the druids of the [[Emerald Grove]] to brew a powerful anti-toxin called the ''[[Elixir of Silvanus]]''. The recipe for which could be found within the ''[[Flora of the Dalelands]]'' book on botany.\n\nMugwort roots were dried and crushed and [[alchemically]] processed into [[salt]]s. This substance, in turn, could be mixed with certain types of alchemical suspension to create an effective variety of ''[[antidote]] [[potion]].''"
