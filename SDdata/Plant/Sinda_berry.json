        "Description": "These berries had a dark brown color and tasted very bitter.",
        "Ecology": {
            "Uses": "Fresh sinda berries had medicinal properties. Consuming 10 of them could confer greater resilience to the [[poison]]s and [[disease]]s of the Chultan jungle for a whole day. Consuming 12 of them could reverse the effects of certain poisons and diseases that sapped strength and vitality. The berries could be eaten whole or could be crushed and mixed with a drink to mask their bitter taste. They lost their medicinal properties about 24 hours after being picked."

        "History": "The druid [[Arvo]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] noted the curative properties of sinda berries in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nSinda berries could be found growing in the gardens of [[Nangalore]] and in [[Omu]]."
