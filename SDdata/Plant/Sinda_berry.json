        "mainbody": "Sinda berries were a variety of berry that grew in the jungles of Chult.\nThese berries had a dark brown color and tasted very bitter.\nSinda berry bushes were considered to be a rare plant in the Chultan jungle. A full-grown bush could grow up to 24 berries in one to four months.\nFresh sinda berries had medicinal properties. Consuming 10 of them could confer greater resilience to the poisons and diseases of the Chultan jungle for a whole day. Consuming 12 of them could reverse the effects of certain poisons and diseases that sapped strength and vitality. The berries could be eaten whole or could be crushed and mixed with a drink to mask their bitter taste. They lost their medicinal properties about 24 hours after being picked. \nThe druid Arvo of Ravens Bluff noted the curative properties of sinda berries in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nSinda berries could be found growing in the gardens of Nangalore and in Omu."
