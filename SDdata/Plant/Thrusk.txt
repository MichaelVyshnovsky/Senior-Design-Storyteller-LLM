Thrusk was a hardy wild grass often used for making infusions.
Thrusk grew in tufts. It had roots that ran deep, making it very hardy and resistant to droughts and heatwaves.
An infusion was commonly made from its roots and leaves. The infusion had a number of properties, being bitter but giving a feeling of warmth to the chest, clearing foul tastes from the mouth, and quickly eliminating any headache not due to a severe head-wound. It was popular amongst caravan drivers for those properties.
The flavor the root itself gave to the infusion was bitter and ropy, akin to licorice. It was an acquired taste, and even for cattle it was only sustenance grazing,
Dipping currant-studded hardbread in thrusk made a meal known as daybreak-swallow.
Thrusk was drunk in Orthil Voldovans caravan during its passage from Scornubel to Waterdeep late in the .
