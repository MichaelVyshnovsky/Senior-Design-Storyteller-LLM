Barrel cactus was a commons species of cacti found in the deserts of Zakhara.
Barrel cacti were large, thick, fleshy plants in a shape of a barrel or an overturned basket. Their bodies ran with sharp needles.
These plants were essential for desert survival. Travelers could slice the top of a barrel cactus off with a sword or a large knife to expose its insides, filled with precious life-giving water. Desert travelers and inhabitants knew to remove the barrel cactus pulp and mash it to extract drinkable water. Each cactus held several pints of water. Some travelers cut cactus flesh into small pieces to be sucked on. However, accidental swallowing of barrel cactus was inadvisable. The plant flesh caused serious stomach cramps if swallowed.
