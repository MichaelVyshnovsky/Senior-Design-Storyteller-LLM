        "mainbody": "The '''ruby blushrose''' was a flowering plant that grew within the [[Rose Garden]] in the [[Battle of Bones]] and other areas of [[Toril]].",
        "Description": "The flower of this plant was bright red, larger than other roses, and lacked thorns. The ruby blushrose gave off a pleasing aroma that made most humans blush when they smelled it but was actually an airborne poison.",
        "Use": "This flower was used in perfumes by inhabitants of [[Kara-Tur]]. Prolonged exposure to the aromas was believed to cause debilitating exhaustion and light-headedness, which some romantics simply attributed to falling in love. It was suspected that the disorientation one experienced within the Rose Garden was partly caused by this plant."
