Ring moss was a type of rare moss found within crevasses near the Lugsaas Chain of the Great Glacier.
Ring moss was silver in color and grew in minuscule rings.
Ring moss was delicately ground into a soft paste and was applied to coat arrows or other weapons. This paste acted as a powerful sedative tirichik. When a tirichik was struck by a weapon coated with ring moss, it fell unconsciousness for a time. The potency of the ring moss paste remained intact for a period of up to four days following its harvesting.
