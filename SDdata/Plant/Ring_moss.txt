'''Ring moss''' was a type of rare moss found within crevasses near the [[Lugsaas Chain]] of the [[Great Glacier]].

==Description==
Ring moss was silver in color and grew in minuscule rings.

==Uses==
Ring moss was delicately ground into a soft paste and was applied to coat [[arrow]]s or other weapons. This paste acted as a powerful sedative [[tirichik]]. When a tirichik was struck by a weapon coated with ring moss, it fell unconsciousness for a time. The potency of the ring moss paste remained intact for a period of up to four days following its harvesting.
