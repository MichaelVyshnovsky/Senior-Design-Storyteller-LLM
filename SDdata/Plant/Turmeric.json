While their price was relatively low, their availability was intermittent.\nTurmeric was a common spice used in Turmish.\nWell-prepared travellers in South and East Faer√ªn often carried a variety of spices and flavorings, including turmeric.\nTurmeric could be mixed with dwarven deepfire brandy to make a substance that surface-dried as a clear coating (such as on metal), but when it dried completely after a few more hours, it disintegrated to ocher-colored turmeric powder once more. It could be used to surreptitiously mark items and those who handled them by the bright stains it left behind."
