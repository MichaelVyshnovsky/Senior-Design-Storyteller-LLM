'''Spellbane''' was a type of plant often used as a [[herb]] for its [[magic]]-nullification properties.

==Effects==
A living creature that ate a piece of spellbane lost all ability to cast [[spell]]s for a period of 3–12 hours, though it did not impede their ability to use [[magical item]]s. For the same period, the creature gained a resistance to magic, or an enhanced resistance if they already possessed such a thing. The degree of resistance depended on the amount consumed, from a sprig or leaf, to a whole plant, to a vast quantity, though it had an upper limit.

==Habitats==
The spellbane plant was only known to grow in [[Cormyr]]. It clung to rocks in areas of deep shade, such as in clefts, in piles of stones in forests, and in the mouths of caves.

==Availability==
Around [[1369]], [[Hanno Minstrelsong]] of [[Hanno's Herbs and Medicines]] in [[Wheloon]], [[Cormyr]], sold spellbane. It was the rarest and most expensive of his stock. He usually had only one small live plant or a small keg of dried leaves in stock. The plant would cost at least 100 [[gp]], while a piece was upwards of 40 [[gp]], and one dried leaf was 25 [[gp]].
