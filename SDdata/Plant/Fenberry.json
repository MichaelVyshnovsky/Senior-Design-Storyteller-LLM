The berries were often used as an arcane component.\nFenberry bushes were low-growing evergreen shrubs that produced small tart green berries that turned darker red as they ripened. Ripe berries were still hard, bitter, and sour and needed preparation before becoming palatable enough to consume.\n* In the Adaerglast region, cranberries grew in bogs east of the city of Myrinjar.\n* The farming village of Bogbrook had many cranberry bogs that produced abundant berry crop.\n* Cranberries could be found among vendors in Waterdeep.\nThe green unripened fenberries were a common component sought after by arcanists for its potency. When extracted, the essence of a handful of fenberries could be used as an ingredient in brewing barkskin potions.\nThe arcane Imaskarran Tome of Life detailed a crafting recipe for a ring of elemental resistance that included fenberries, quartz crystal, and the spell of endure elements.\nA crafting recipe for a wand of lightning found in the Imaskarran Tome of Resonance included ettercaps silk gland, fenberries, and the spell of lightning bolt.\nThe Tome of the Amulet held the secrets of creating amulets of natural armor, namely the ingredients of a slaad tongue, fenberries, and the spell of mage armor.\nAnd lastly, the Tome of the Ring had a crafting recipe for a ring of regeneration.
