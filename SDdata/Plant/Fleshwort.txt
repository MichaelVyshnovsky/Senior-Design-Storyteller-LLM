Fleshwort was a plant that could be used to aid in the healing of injuries.
The stalks of fleshwort were gray and resembled celery.
Fleshwort stalks could be sewn into the internal injury of any  mammal to provide the raw materials for the body to grow new tissue.
Fleshwort could only be found in areas where corpses, particularly from battles, were recently buried near the surface or left to rot aboveground.
