'''Junipers''' were a species of plant in the ''Realms'' that could be either a bush or a tree.D&D sourcebooks and magazines have flip-flopped over the years on whether junipers are bushes or trees. In actuality, they can be either depending upon their species.

==Habitats==
* In [[East Faerûn]], junipers grew in the [[Methwood]].
* [[North Faerûn]]'s [[Tarkhaldale]], in the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]] had a population of low-growing juniper bushes along with [[pine]] and [[spruce]] trees. Junipers also grew in this region on the island of [[Lone Rock]].<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/64/The Everwinking Eye: Daily Life in Mulmaster|20}}
* In [[northwest Faerûn]], junipers grew in the [[Ice Spires]] and in the cold wilderness of [[Icewind Dale]].
* In [[West Faerûn]], juniper trees could be found in abundance in the [[Calim Caliphates]], around the city of [[Cursrah]] and the [[River Agis]], as well as in the [[Western Heartlands]].{{Cite dungeon/37/A Wizard's Fate|22}}
* In the [[Unapproachable East]], junipers grew around [[Lake Ashane]].
* Beyond [[Faerûn]], junipers grew in the [[Pasocada Basin]] in [[Maztica]].
===Beyond Toril===
* Outside of [[Toril]], juniper plants could be found in the  land of [[Barovia]], where berries were used for their alchemical properties and as a tool against [[werefox]]es.<ref>{{Cite book| author =  Nigel Findley| title = Van Richten's Guide to Werebeasts| short_story = | date = | editor = Andria Hayday| publisher = TSR, Inc.| ISBN = l-56076-633-6| pages = 26-27| chapter = }}

==Usages==
* Parts of the juniper plant were commonly used as a seasoning.
* In the [[Moonsea]] region, healers from [[Phlan]] used juniper and [[mint]] as components in their healing ointments. These salves possessed strong but pleasant scent of both.
* [[Juniper oil]].
* In the Pasocada Basin, junipers were a common part of the diet of the native [[Azuposi]].
* Juniper berries were used in tonics for their stimulant, and disinfectant properties. They also were used to remedy venereal [[disease]]s and as an aphrodisiac.

==History==
Junipers existed in the Realms since the days of [[Netheril]].<ref>

Around {{YearlinkName|1367}},<ref> the royal court of [[Kozakura]] gifted eleven bonzai-style juniper trees to the [[E'do formal gardens]].

==Trivia==
* ''[[Blightbringer]]'', an enchanted [[bow]] that belonged to a [[goblin]] [[shaman]] [[Kirrkuk Redrats]], was crafted out of a juniper sapling the shaman grew in the ashes of his slain opponent.<ref>
* Juniper was a common name for male [[pixie]]s.
* [[Minder]], a once-living-[[dwarf]] [[golem]] of the ship ''[[Realms Master]]'', often dreamt of her favorite scents from her past. These included the smell of juniper, pine, ice-cold air, and the taste of [[ale]].{{Cite dragon/247/Rogues Gallery: Crew of the Realms Master|76}}
