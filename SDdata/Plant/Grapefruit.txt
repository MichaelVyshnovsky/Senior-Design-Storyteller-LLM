Grapefruit was a species of edible citrus fruit found in Calimshan and the Vast.
Grapefruits could be found being sold in the markets of the Temple District of Ravens Bluff.
Custard decorated with grapefruit wedges and dusted with cinnamon was a desert dish from the ancient Calimshan cuisine.
Ravenaar folk made appetizers of baked grapefruit, notably, in the kittens of the DeVillars estate.
