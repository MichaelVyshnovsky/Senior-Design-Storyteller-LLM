        "mainbody": "Powderpuff was a small white flower with bluish leaves that grew in the polar regions of Anadia.\nPowderpuff was a triple-stemmed plant with small bluish-green leaves. The flowers were white and small and highly poisonous. Any bruise caused the flowers to secrete a potent poison that could penetrate the skin and leave a creature in a catatonic state for ten days.\nThe flowers could be dried and powdered to produce an explosive substance akin to smokepowder, but only about half as potent."
