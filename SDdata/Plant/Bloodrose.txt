'''Bloodrose''' bushes were a decorative plant from [[Teziir]].

==Description==
The bloodrose was a darker rose bush with blood-red flowers.

==Cultivation==
These roses were at first only known to have been grown by a conclave of [[cleric]]s near [[Teziir]], then gifted to the Lord of [[Suzail]]. In the {{yearlinkName|1000}}, they started growing in the wild in the [[Battle of Bones]]; though all of the roses died that year, enough were taken to propagate the type.

==Usage==
Bloodroses were pricey to cultivate because of how delicate they were, but that made them all the more valuable.
