'''Silkroot''', also known as '''knight's veil''' or '''styxroot''', was a stimulant that improved the reflexes and caused temporary euphoria. 

==Geography==
The root was found growing wild in [[Akanûl]]. Unfortunately, silkroot was addictive and eventually ate through the stomach of users. Silkroot addicts could be weaned off the drug by chewing on the leaves of the plant.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], members of [[the Guild]] worked with smugglers who brought [[drug]]s, [[weapon]]s, [[firewine]], and other substances into [[Baldur's Gate]]. Pouches of {{SI|0.8|lb|k|long=yes}} silkroot were among such illicit goods.
