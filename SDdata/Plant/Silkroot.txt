Silkroot, also known as knights veil or styxroot, was a stimulant that improved the reflexes and caused temporary euphoria. 
The root was found growing wild in Akanûl. Unfortunately, silkroot was addictive and eventually ate through the stomach of users. Silkroot addicts could be weaned off the drug by chewing on the leaves of the plant.
In the late 15 century DR, members of the Guild worked with smugglers who brought drugs, weapons, firewine, and other substances into Baldurs Gate. Pouches of  silkroot were among such illicit goods.
