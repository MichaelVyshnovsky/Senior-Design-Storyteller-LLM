Fireweed was a type of spongy leafless plant that grew in volcanic regions.
Fireweeds grew in stands, much like scrub weeds, and reproduced asexually. As they matured their color palette shifted from black, to purple, and finally red.
Much like fire lichen, fireweeds survived by absorbing the heat from their surroundings, This absorption of heat extended to being invulnerable to all forms of fire, even magical. Rather than being destroyed by it, fire was known to tremendously accelerate the growth and proliferation of fireweeds.
Fireweeds were also known to absorb the foul toxins in their volcanic environments and convert them into breathable air.
Fireweeds were typically found in volcanic regions, but they were most well known for being distributed in the Underdark
Fireweeds were considered by most creatures in the Underdark to be a vital source of sustenance in volcanic regions, but also highly valued for the breathable air they produced. As a result, surface-dwellers who deliberately harmed fireweeds were often punished.
Derro were one race in the Underdark particularly known for harvesting fireweeds, using them for both food and dyeing clothing.
In Muspelheim, they were specifically cultivated by the planes fire giant inhabitants as a food source.
Some inns and taverns in arctic regions were known to serve a beverage called "moss mead", which partially consisted of fireweed seeds. A liquor derived from fireweed was also known to often be consumed by copper dragons when celebrating a hatchlings birthday.
