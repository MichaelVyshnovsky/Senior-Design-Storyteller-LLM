{{otheruses|song (disambiguation)}}
The '''school of song''' was a group of [[arcane spell]]s that used the voice, speaking or singing, as its central element. It was considered a [[school of thaumaturgy]], a system of grouping spells not by the philosophies of the traditional [[schools of magic]], but by the method that was used to access magical energy.

The school of song was in opposition to the schools of [[necromancy]], [[divination]], and [[invocation/evocation]].

Specialists in the school of song were called [[spellsinger]]s or song mages.
