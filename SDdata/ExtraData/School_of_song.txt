The school of song was a group of arcane spells that used the voice, speaking or singing, as its central element. It was considered a school of thaumaturgy, a system of grouping spells not by the philosophies of the traditional schools of magic, but by the method that was used to access magical energy.
The school of song was in opposition to the schools of necromancy, divination, and invocation/evocation.
Specialists in the school of song were called spellsingers or song mages.
