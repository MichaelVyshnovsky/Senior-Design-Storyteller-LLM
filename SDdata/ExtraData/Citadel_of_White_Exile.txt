The '''Citadel of White Exile''' was a place located on the border between the [[Positive Energy Plane]] and the [[Plane of Gems]].  

== Description ==
The Citadel itself was a tall white tower, with the top not more than fifty feet (15.2 m) from the Positive Energy Plane.

There were only two entrances, one leading to the [[Hill of Fangs]] near [[Westgate]], and one to the [[Abyss]] and (eventually) to the [[Rarandreth|home plane]] of the god [[Moander]].

It served as the prison of [[Finder]], since time did not pass normally there.
