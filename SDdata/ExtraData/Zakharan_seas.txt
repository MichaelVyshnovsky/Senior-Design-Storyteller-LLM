The continent of [[Zakhara]] was renowned for its burning deserts and lush jungles<ref>, but the '''seas''' surrounding its varied coastlines allowed much travel and trade hindered by its harsh interior.<ref>

==Surrounding seas==
The Land of Fate was surrounded by three major seas:<br />
*The [[Great Sea]], or "Bahr al-Kibar", stretched to the north and west, separating Zakhara and [[Faerûn]].
*To the east daring sailors crossed the [[Foreigners' Sea]], or "Bahr al-Ajami", to the distant lands of [[Kara-Tur]].
*To the south Zakhara was bounded by the so-called [[Crowded Sea]], or "Bahr al-Izdiham", characterized by a large number of inhabited as well as unknown islands and crossed by many trading ships.<ref><ref>

==Interior seas==
*Between the cities of [[Jumlat]] and [[I'tiraf]], the Crowded Sea narrowed to form the [[Golden Gulf]] that separated the [[League of the Pantheon]] to the east from its ideological counterpart, the [[Pearl Cities]], to the west.<ref>
*To the north, the gulf narrowed again into long and narrow [[Suq Bay]]. Zakhara's central [[Cities of the Heart]] stretched along its shores, from [[Huzuz|Golden Huzuz]], "the heart of the heart", in the south,<ref> to industrious [[Hiyal]] in the north<ref>.<ref> Its narrowest part, located at the height of [[Wasat]] in the middle, separated Suq Bay into a Southern and a Northern Quarter.
*From Hiyal to the west, the [[Al-Tariq Channel]] ("The Passage") connected Suq Bay to the inland [[Sea of Caravans]].<ref><br /> 
Together, these interior bodies of water separated the west of Zakhara almost completely from its central and eastern portion, with only a relatively narrow strip of land between [[Qudra]] and [[Liham]] connecting the regions of the [[High Desert]] and the [[Haunted Lands]].
