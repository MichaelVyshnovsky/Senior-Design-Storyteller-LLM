        "Effects": "This curse was carried by a [[dowagu]], a dangerous creature created through [[magic]] by Ambuchar Devayam. When one of these creatures touched a target, they marked them with the curse that appeared in the form of a dark tattoo on their skin. The victim did not experience any symptoms that something was amiss, but when they died, regardless of their cause of death, they rose as a [[zombie]] and traveled to [[Solon]] to serve as a mindless participant in Ambuchar's dark army. Particularly skilled victims rose from their death as a stronger form of [[undead]] such as a [[vampire]], [[wight]], etc.\n\nIt was impossible to remove or cover the Stamp of Tan Chin by any means, including the use of a ''[[wish]]'', short of killing Ambuchar Devayam.",
