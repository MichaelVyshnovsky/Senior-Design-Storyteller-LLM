When one of these creatures touched a target, they marked them with the curse that appeared in the form of a dark tattoo on their skin. The victim did not experience any symptoms that something was amiss, but when they died, regardless of their cause of death, they rose as a zombie and traveled to Solon to serve as a mindless participant in Ambuchars dark army. Particularly skilled victims rose from their death as a stronger form of undead such as a vampire, wight, etc.\nIt was impossible to remove or cover the Stamp of Tan Chin by any means, including the use of a wish, short of killing Ambuchar Devayam.\nCategoryCurses\nCategoryTattoos\nen2qwcmuc3l2yy927n5ahp5c5e599ny"
