'''Geomancy''' was a system of [[magic]] based upon the study of the [[earth (element)|element of earth]]. This magic was used almost exclusively in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate, specifically in the ancient kingdom of [[Kadar]].{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|9}}

==Practitioners==
This form of magic was used specifically by special [[wizard]]s and [[priest]]s of [[Grumbar]] in Zakhara, specifically the [[Cities of the Ancients]] region, called [[Geomancer]]s. Geomancers could be individuals who strictly practiced either [[arcane]] or [[divine magic]], but the most powerful geomancers known to history were those who practiced both forms of magic.

==Usage==
The Geomancers used their magic to understand and interpret [[Fate]]. Their unique holistic philosophy combined both arcane and divine magic to create extremely powerful runes called [[geoglyph]]s.
