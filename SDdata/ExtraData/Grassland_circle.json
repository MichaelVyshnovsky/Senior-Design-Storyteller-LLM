        "mainbody": "The grassland circle was a druid circle associated with the wide open plains and prairies. Druids who took up the cause of nature in such a region had an affinity for this circle and the suite of spells that came to them without cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).\nThose new to the grassland circle were granted two spells to make them or their allies avoid detection invisibility and pass without trace. Druids that became more versed could cast daylight, haste, divination, and freedom of movement. Those that were very skilled could cast both dream and insect plague."
