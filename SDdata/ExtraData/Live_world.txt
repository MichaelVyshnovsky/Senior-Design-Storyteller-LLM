A '''live world''', or '''plant body''', was a debated classification for celestial bodies within a [[crystal sphere]]. The term was presented by the scholars of [[Kara-Tur]] as a description for a world that was alive, or perhaps even sentient. Other scholars preferred to limit the types of worlds to each of the four elements, [[air]], [[Earth (element)|earth]], [[fire]], and [[water]]. To these scholars, a plant body would simply be classified as an earth body.
