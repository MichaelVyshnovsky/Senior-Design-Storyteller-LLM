{{otheruses4|the Region|the Empire|Netheril}} 
The land of '''Netheril''' was the land largely occupied by the nation of [[Netheril]].

In the beginning of the [[Age of Humanity]], Netheril was a verdant land, until the coming of the [[phaerimm]]. Starting in {{Yearlink|-461}}, the phaerimm started casting spells that caused the lush land to change into desert. Such was the change that, in [[10 DR]], the region became known as [[Anauroch]] to reflect the desert that it had become.

In [[1372 DR]], the city of [[Thultanthar]] returned to this region. The [[Spellplague]] and other forces had an even greater impact and by [[1479 DR]] the desert was gone and a new land had arisen.
