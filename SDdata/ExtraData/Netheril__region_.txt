The land of Netheril was the land largely occupied by the nation of Netheril.
In the beginning of the Age of Humanity, Netheril was a verdant land, until the coming of the phaerimm. Starting in , the phaerimm started casting spells that caused the lush land to change into desert. Such was the change that, in 10 DR, the region became known as Anauroch to reflect the desert that it had become.
In 1372 DR, the city of Thultanthar returned to this region. The Spellplague and other forces had an even greater impact and by 1479 DR the desert was gone and a new land had arisen.
