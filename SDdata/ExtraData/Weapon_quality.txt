A '''weapon quality''', sometimes called a '''weapon special ability''', was the name of an [[enchantment]] that could be placed on a [[weapon]]. Weapons enchanted this way could benefit direct combat, such as draining life from an enemy, or make combat more efficient, such as allowing the wielder to reload quickly.

==Enchantment==
In order to enchant an existing weapon, a versed [[enchanter]] had to use a powerful spell during the process. Both ranged and melee weapons could be enchanted in such a way, and sold for high market prices.

==List of weapon qualities==
''For an extensive list, see [[:Category:Weapon qualities]]''
===Melee===
* ''[[Corrosive (weapon quality)|Corrosive]]'': made the weapon acidic, causing it to deal more damage in direct combat.
* ''[[Knockback]]'': the weapon could push or knock over an enemy, giving the wielder or their allies a chance to finish them.

===Ranged===
* ''[[Seeking]]'': the ammunition of the enchanted weapon, when fired, would home towards an opponent.
* ''[[Quick-loading]]'': the wielder could draw and reload [[crossbow]] [[bolt]]s in an extra-dimensional space.

===Either===
* ''[[Merciful]]'': made sure blows to a target were non-lethal.

==Appendix==
===See Also===
* [[Armor quality]]
