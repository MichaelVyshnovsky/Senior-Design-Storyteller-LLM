A weapon quality, sometimes called a weapon special ability, was the name of an enchantment that could be placed on a weapon. Weapons enchanted this way could benefit direct combat, such as draining life from an enemy, or make combat more efficient, such as allowing the wielder to reload quickly.
In order to enchant an existing weapon, a versed enchanter had to use a powerful spell during the process. Both ranged and melee weapons could be enchanted in such a way, and sold for high market prices.
For an extensive list, see CategoryWeapon qualities
* Corrosive made the weapon acidic, causing it to deal more damage in direct combat.
* Knockback the weapon could push or knock over an enemy, giving the wielder or their allies a chance to finish them.
* Seeking the ammunition of the enchanted weapon, when fired, would home towards an opponent.
* Quick-loading the wielder could draw and reload crossbow bolts in an extra-dimensional space.
* Merciful made sure blows to a target were non-lethal.
* Armor quality
