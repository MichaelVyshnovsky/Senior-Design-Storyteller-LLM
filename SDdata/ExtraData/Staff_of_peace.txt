A '''staff of peace''' is most often made from [[yew]] and contains the ''[[calm emotions]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', and ''[[sanctuary]]'' spells, all heightened to 6th level, and two of the ''[[greater command]]'' spell. If the wielder's patron is [[Eldath]], he or she becomes quite the diplomat. The staff is worth around 175,000 gold pieces.
