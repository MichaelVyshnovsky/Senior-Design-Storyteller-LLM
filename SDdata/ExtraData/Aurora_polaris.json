Near the northern poles, these were called northern lights.\nAurorae had a wide range of shapes—curtains, halos, pillars, streaks, whisps—and a plethora of colors—usually pale green or pink but also shades of red, yellow, blue, or violet.\nAurorae usually lasted from one to six hours and provided a similar amount of light as the moon.\nLearned scholars knew that the auroral displays were actually roiling regions of intense electrical energy some six to nine miles (ten to sixteen kilometers) above the surface, able to harm any creature that might be able to fly to such heights.\nThe inhabitants of the divine realm of Asgard, located on the plane and layer of Ysgard according to the Great Wheel cosmology, believed that an aurora polaris was a reflection of fallen warriors still fighting in the afterlife. Many travelers of the Deep Ethereal likened the appearance of ethereal curtains to the northern lights."
