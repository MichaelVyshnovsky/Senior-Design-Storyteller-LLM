It was counted by most sages as the fifth age.\nThe Age was said to have begun with the birth of Jeriah Chronos in Netheril Year 1652, which corresponds to  in the Dalereckoning. It extended for a millennium until 2654 NY/, the year before chardalyn was first discovered, ushering in the Age of Discovery.\nDuring this time, Netheril was at its most powerful. There was even a stretch of time where one city was being raised into the sky as a flying enclave every year until there was a total of dozens of them moving around the empire on air currents.\nAs this Age progressed, citizens of High Netheril had less and less say in their lives, being governed solely by the whims of the archwizard who had raised their city.\nFor their part, it was during this age that many archwizards began to use their magic to explore the planes of existence, particularly the Inner Planes.\n*  &mdash Jeriah Chronos is born.\n*  &mdash The Chronomancer fails to defend the nation of Illusk from an orc horde and is mortally wounded.\n*  &mdash The Chronomancer dies from his wounds.\n*  &mdash Thieves steal 24 sections of the remaining Nether Scrolls from Ioulaum.\n* c.  &mdash The empire explores the Sea of Fallen Stars and founds undersea colonies, collectively known as Deep Netheril.\n*  &mdash Deep Netheril is destroyed by the high mages of Aryselmalyr, during the Battle of the Three Seaflames, and the powerful magics create the bays of Saerloon and Selgaunt.\n*  &mdash The mines of Dekanter cease producing useful ore.\n*  &mdash The enclave of Sunrest crashes to the earth because of a failed spell experiment, the first of the flying cities to ever fall. There are no survivors.\n*  &mdash Thultanthar, the City of Shade, is founded.\n*  &mdash One of the Netherese arcanists teaches members of the barbarian Angardt tribes magic, triggering a war between the Angardt and the neighboring Rengardt tribes. The war lasted for seven years.\n*  &mdash Chardalyn is discovered, moving the empire into the Age of Discovery."
