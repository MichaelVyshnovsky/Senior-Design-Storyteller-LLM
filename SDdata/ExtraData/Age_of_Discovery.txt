The '''Age of Discovery''' was a period of the history of [[Netheril]] lasting from {{YearlinkConvert|2654|NY}} to {{YearlinkConvert|3163|NY}}.

==History==
The age started with the discovery of ''[[chardalyn]]s''. [[Elorian]], an [[arcanist]] of Netheril, found these crystals while examining some rocks. After the discovery, the Netherese Empire started excessive mining operations in almost every mountain as it was believed that there was greater power in these rocks.

The second part of the Age of Discovery was the discovery of [[spelljammer]]s. The arcanists of Netheril created only one outpost, [[Yeoman's Loft]] and conducted many "experiments" on anything they encountered. This behavior gave them a very bad reputation, resulting in their separation from the spelljamming community. A lone arcanist, [[Oberon (Netherese arcanist)|Oberon]], tried his best to repair their reputation but to no effect. As a result, the Netherese could not trade and so most spelljamming explorations were abandoned, because they were too expensive.

The end of the Age of Discovery is marked by the birth of [[Karsus]].
