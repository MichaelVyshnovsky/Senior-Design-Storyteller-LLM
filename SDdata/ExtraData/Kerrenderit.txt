'''Kerrenderit''' were coin-sized ice crystals of exceeding sharpness that could be magically enhanced to form deadly arrowheads. Kerrenderit were nurtured by the [[arctic dwarf|arctic dwarves]] in caves carved into the [[Great Glacier]] and they took a long time to form. The word "Kerrenderit" came from the Kurit dialect of [[Dwarvish]].<ref>
