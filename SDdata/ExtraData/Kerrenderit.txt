Kerrenderit were coin-sized ice crystals of exceeding sharpness that could be magically enhanced to form deadly arrowheads. Kerrenderit were nurtured by the arctic dwarves in caves carved into the Great Glacier and they took a long time to form. The word "Kerrenderit" came from the Kurit dialect of Dwarvish.
