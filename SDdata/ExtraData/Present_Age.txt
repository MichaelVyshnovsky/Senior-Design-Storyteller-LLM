The Present Age was the time period that started in the year 1000 DR and continued to the late 15 century DR. 
The Present Age was considered one of the most tumultuous ages in the history of Toril. It was a time of constant struggle but also a time of discovery and exploration.
During the first years of the Present Age, Faer√ªn reestablished trade with Kara-Tur and Zakhara, and the Great Glacier began to retreat, uncovering the realms of Vaasa and Damara. Later, the continent of Maztica was discovered by Amnians.
In a period of less that one hundred fifty years, the world of Toril was nearly destroyed, shaken to its core. and while its "reunion" with its long lost twin world, Abeir, was brief, its mark on Toril was significant and enduring, Tymanther and Laerakond.
