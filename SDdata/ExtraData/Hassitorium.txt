'''''Hassitoriums''''' were a unique form of mobile fortress found only in the [[plane]] of [[Acheron]], where they were utilized by the various spirit legions that constantly waged war there.

==Description==
These fortresses were bizarre fusions of machinery, [[iron]]work, stonemasonry, and [[necromantic]] [[magic]]. Hordes of [[slave]]s,{{Cite organized play/LC/Stone and Steel|11}} were built into the very walls of each. These beings lived in a constant state of anguish, their bodies and [[positive energy|life force]] powering the structures. Once a creature was entombed within the walls of a ''hassitorium'', it was impossible to remove them.

The living beings built into the walls of a hassitorium acted as its motive force, as well as some of its moving parts.{{Cite organized play/LC/Stone and Steel|10}} and were forced to drag the structures along on roughly hewed runners made out of either iron or [[steel]]. These runners produced a torrent of sparks as the ''hassitorium'' moved across the uneven metal battlefields of Acheron, leaving behind glowing hot skid marks in their wake.< On occasion the slaves within these walls were said to stumble and tumble out of them if they couldn't keep up the pace demanded of them, leaving them to be crushed under the oppressive weight of their ''hassitorium''.

It took a special individual to command a ''hassitorium'', though it was not a requirement for captains to be [[wizard]]s.

==Notable Hassitoriums==
* ''[[Istvarhan]]'', also referred to as ''Ishtavarek'', was a ''hassitorium'' commanded by the [[half-orc]] [[Estrak Longtooth]] on behalf of the [[orc]]ish spirit legions.

==History==
The ''hassitoriums'' were named for their creators, an ancient race known as the [[hassitor]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Stone and Steel|10-11}} Some time after they fell extinct, the spirit legions of Acheron learned how to recreate the processes by which to forge a ''hassitorium''.

By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]],

Around this time a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]] visited the plane of Acheron. There they came upon the ''Ishtavarek'' and its captain, Estrak Longtooth. When they inquired with the half-orc as to where they were, he told them the name of his ''hassitorium'', of the race that had created the mobile fortresses, and gave a rough explanation as to how they operated.
