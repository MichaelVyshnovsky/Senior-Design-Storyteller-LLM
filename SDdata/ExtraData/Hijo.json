        "mainbody": "he Hijo clan was the ninja clan ally of Funada clan in Nakamaru in Wa around 1357 DR. The Hijo were tied to the Funada not only by loyalty or greed but also by ancient tradition and by giriâ€”a sense of obligation and duty. Normally, they pursued their personal goals and only changed their plans if they might cause harm to the Funada or if giri obligated them to stop. Their headquarters was not in Nakamuru city but in a small village deep in the mountains, where they were free to practice their \"mountain-style\" ninjitsu. Many members lived in the city, however, but were very difficult to find. They had no insignia they recognized each other because all Hijo ninga knew all others in the clan.\nThe clan was led by a sensei (master) who, with the advice of elders, decided all the strategy of the clan and determined all assignments. The clan mostly recruited from other clan families. Members unfit for the role of ninja often left and a few started successful careers, but it was expected that they would return to help the clan if necessity arose."
