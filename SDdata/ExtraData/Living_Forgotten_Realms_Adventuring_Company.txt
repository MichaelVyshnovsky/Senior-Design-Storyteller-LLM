===ADCP2-1 The Paladins' Plague===
{{Main|The Paladins' Plague}}
{{Quote|''The leaders of Elturel are concerned about the plagueland a few miles outside the city, which has recently begun spewing out more twisted monstrosities than usual. The paladins have put out a call for adventuring companies to send their best and bravest explorers to venture to the border, and perhaps even into the plagueland itself. The expedition's charter is to bring back any information about the horrors within and what might be causing the increase in Spellplague activity. This is a risky assignment, offering adventurers the chance to make a name for themselves by braving one of the most dangerous and least understood threats in all of Faer√ªn. This adventure is a two-round continuous-play Living Forgotten Realms Battle Interactive set in Elturgard for characters levels 1&ndash;17.''}}
