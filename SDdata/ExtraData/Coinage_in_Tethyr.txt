'''Coinage''' within the nation of [[Tethyr]] varied greatly over the many centuries. The early [[human]] tribes used a bartering system before the region became a part of the [[Calim Empire]] and then of [[Coramshan]] and later [[Calimshan]]. The [[Shoon Imperium]], too, imposed its own currency, as did four separate [[Tethyrian]] dynasties. During the [[Tethyrian Interregnum|Interregnum]], many of the larger cities and even guilds minted their own coins.

==Interregnum Period==
During the Interregnum, [[Zazesspur]]'s main coin was the '''gulder''', which was comparable to a [[gold piece]] in most economies. At the time, it was the most valuable coin in Tethyr, and moneychangers in [[Amn]] would exchange 100 [[danter]]s for 107 gulders. It had the seal of the city on both sides&mdash;three overlapping [[trident]]s ringed by gold coins.
