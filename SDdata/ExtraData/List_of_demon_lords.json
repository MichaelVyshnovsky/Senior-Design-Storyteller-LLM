        "The Queen of Desolationâ€™s actions signify her unspoken message: The Abyss shall have no lord but ruin.\n|The [[Demonomicon of Iggwilv]]<ref>\n}}\nOublivae, called the Queen of Desolation, the Demon Monarch of the Barrens, and the Angel of the Everlasting Void, was a demon lord associated with ruin and history. She ruled [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 100: The Barrens|The Barrens]]. Her knowledge of history was rivalled only by that of Graz'zt, Vecna, and Iggwilv, but her area of expertise centered around destruction and ruin. She only allied with select demon lords in order the halt the expansion of rivals' realms, further spreading chaos throughout the Abyss.\n\nOublivae's head was that of a luminous fey crowned with horns. Her body resembled a humanoid insect, complete with sharpened armor plating and a sinuous tail that terminated in a deadly stinger. Oublivae's long ghoulish tongue was used to lap up the blood of her victims. When provoked, Oublivae dropped to all fours and attacked like a feral beast. She preferred to isolate her foes and pick them off one at a time, showing them glimpses of a future where all they loved was destroyed, before consuming their souls.\n\nUndead and other demons not sworn to Orcus followed Oublivae, spreading her chaos and hopelessness wherever they roamed. Mortal followers of Oublivae were often pirates, outlaws, and savages. Most decorated their bodies with tattoos mimicking Oublivae's own appearance. They consumed the flesh of their enemies to honor the Queen of Desolation.\n\nOublivae crawled up from the dregs of the Barrens during an unknown age, eventually garnering the attention of the Barrens' lord at the time, [[Ugoreth]]. Ugoreth surrounded her with his minions and demanded her service. Oublivae managed to convince the demon lord that she carried a message for his ears alone, using Ugoreth's vanity to gain a private audience with him. Oublivae attacked the demon lord, consuming his soul and sending him to the bottomless ruins of the Barrens and claiming the title of Demon Lord for herself.": "==P-T===",
        "mainbody": "==Qij-na====\nQij-na the Shattered was one of the seven demon lords who allied to bring down [[the Malgoth]], but who fell in the process as they were killed or imprisoned by opportunistic rivals.\n\n====Queen Abiding====\n{{Main|Queen Abiding}}\nThe Queen Abiding was a petty demon lord bound beneath Dun-Tharos.\n\n====Rajzak====\nRajzak, called the Lord of the Spires, was a maddened and bestial demon lord who dwelled in the [[Layers of the Abyss#The Spires of Rajzak|The Spires of Rajzak]], killing and devouring any creatures it encountered. He was some {{SI|80|ft}} tall and at least twice as wide as that, an obscene mass of claws and mouths, with some parts seeming reptilian, others amphibian, and yet others thoroughly indescribable, all covered in oozing sores and propelling itself along on dozens of stubby limbs. It healed at an alarming rate, being capable of even regrowing limbs lost to battle or accident. Rajzak was said to exist only to eat and destroy; it gave no sign of being capable of either speech or intelligent thought. However, it was said (in an obscure and cryptic passage in the [[Demonomicon of Iggwilv]]) that Rajzak was originally one of the earliest demon lords, known in those long-ago ages by a name long since forgotten, and was then a demon lord of both beauty and guile. He was said to have meddled in the politics of the Abyss and the planes, which eventually led to him coming into conflict with Graz'zt- a conflict that ended with a battle in which Graz'zt tore Rajzak's mind and soul away, hiding it as \"an itinerant hellflame, forever lost.\" Scholars who studied this passage largely agreed that Graz'zt intended to keep his former enemy trapped and tormented in its former domain, although some scholars thought that Rajzak had tricked Graz'zt into transforming it, and that it was slowly becoming the most powerful demon prince in the cosmos.\n\n====Rhindor'zt====\nRhindor'zt the Black Prince was one of the seven demon lords who allied to bring down [[the Malgoth]], but who fell in the process as they were killed or imprisoned by opportunistic rivals.\n\n====Rhyxali====\n{{Main|Rhyxali}}\nRhyxali, called the Queen of the Shadow Demons, was a demon lord associated with [[shadow demon]]s and secrets. She ruled over [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 49: Shaddonon|Shaddonon]].\n\n====Rimmon====\nRimmon was said to be a long-dead demon lord who died when he, Orcus, and Demogorgon stormed the realm of the god Amoth, who unleashed an apocalyptic spell in order to destroy all three; Orcus and Demogorgon survived, however, by using Rimmon as a shield.\n\n====Rr'ikin'aka====\nRr'ikin'aka, called the King of Scorpions, was a foolish tanar'ri lord challenged both Tharzax and [[Obox-ob]] simultaneously for control of scorpions and such. He wound up imprisoned in the Wells of Darkness, the shaft of his prison filled with the husks of countless scorpions. The dead bugs were considered a delicacy by that layer's scavengers.\n\n====Salis Thik====\nSalis Thik was a dead demon lord who was said by some sources to have once ruled the 333{{rd}} layer of the Abyss.<ref>\n\n====Sch'theraqpasstt====\nSch'theraqpasstt ({{Pronounce|schik|there|AUK|past}}), called the Serpent Reborn, was a demon lord associated with [[yuan-ti]]. He ruled over [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 111: The Mind of Evil|The Mind of Evil]]. He was once a lesser deity of the yuan-ti before he performed a ritual meant to merge his mind with his layer in an attempt to gain power. However, while the ritual succeeded, it drove most of his mind insane and turned the layer into lifeless, chaotic whirling storm. The remaining sane portion of his psyche formed a physical form, a {{SIAdj|60|ft|adj=long}} winged ebon serpent. While this physical form could be killed, it always reformed back in the Mind of Evil, for at the price of his sanity and godhood, Sch'theraqpasstt had achieved indestructible immortality. Some yuan-ti, however, still plotted to reverse his downfall.<ref>{{Cite dragon/151/Ecology of the Yuan-ti|34}}\n\n====Sess'innek====\n{{Main|Sess'innek}}\nSess'innek, called the Emperor Lizard, was a demon lord associated with [[lizardfolk]] and civilization. He ruled [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 7: The Phantom Plane|The Phantom Plane]], the 7{{th}} layer of the Abyss.\n\n====Shaktari====\n{{Main|Shaktari}}\nShaktari, the Queen of Mariliths, was a demon lord associated with [[marilith]] demons. She ruled over [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 531: Vudra|Vudra]].\n\n====Shami-Amourae====\n{{Main|Shami-Amourae}}\nShami-Amourae, called the Queen of the Succubi was a demon lord associated with [[Succubus|succubi]]. She was imprisoned in [[The Wells of Darkness]].\n\n====Sifkhu====\nSifkhu was perhaps the only [[loumara]] demon lord. He had been found, still dormant, in the Dreaming Gulf by Malcanthet and subsequently bound and imprisoned by her.<ref>{{Cite dragon/353/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Malcanthet: Queen of the Succubi|27}}\n\n====Siragle====\n{{Main|Siragle}}\nSiragle the Ineffable was a demon lord associated with secret oaths. He ruled over [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 493: The Steeping Isle|The Steeping Isle]].\n\n====Socothbenoth====\nSocothbenoth, called the Persuader, was a demon lord associated with perversion. He ruled [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 597: Goranthis|Goranthis]].\n\n====Soneillon====\n{{Main|Soneillon}}\nSoneillon, and the Youthful Crone, was a succubus-like demon lord associated with rejuvenation. She lived on the layer of [[Spirac]].\n\n====Tantagaras====\nTantagaras was a demon lord who was said to be the creator of the [[nalfeshnee]], but who died during Tharizdun's war against the gods, slain by Kord in battle. The then-simpleminded nalfeshnee grieved for him, then ate his flesh and evolved into cunning and wicked demons.<ref>\n\n====Tharzax====\nTharzax, called the Chattering Prince, was a demon lord associated with poisonous vermin. He ruled the second layer of the Abyss, [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 2: Driller's Hives|Driller's Hives]]. Some savage cults worshiped him, holding monstrous centipedes as sacred to him.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/123/Salvage Operation|21}}\n\n====Thralhavoc====\nThralhavoc, called the Shadowmaster, was a demon lord associated with undead shadows and subterfuge. What layer he ruled or dwelled upon was unrecorded. He had originally ruled the 348{{th}} layer of the Abyss, [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 348: Indifference|Indifference]], but he abandoned it to seek a more appealing realm.<ref>\n\n====Turaglas====\n[[File:Turaglas.png|thumb|200px|right|''Turaglas, the Hunger Eternal.'']]\nTuraglas ({{Pronounce|tu|RAWG|lahss}}, sometimes spelled Turgalas), called the Ebon Maw, the Hunger Eternal, the Insatiable and the Devourer, was a demon lord associated with hunger and consumption. He ruled over [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 32: Sholo-Tovoth: The Fields of Consumption|Sholo-Tovoth]]. He was the largest and among the most primal of the tanar'ri demon lords, motivated by nothing more than endless hunger, uncaring of the affairs of mortals or other demons. In the distant past when he first crawled out of the depths of the Abyss, he took part in the wars amongst the demon lords, but in time he somehow reached the Material plane, where he began to devour everything, from the smallest creatures to the largest, and even plain stone. He was worshiped by a powerful cult called the Feeders of the Ebon Maw that wrecked devastation in his name, and served by a type of tanar'ri called the [[turagathshnee]]. But in time, his cult was scattered and he was imprisoned, by two most unlikely allies: Orcus and Demogorgon. The two demon lords set their own cults to destroying the Feeders, their armies against the Devourer himself, until at the last the two demon princes themselves stepped through a gate to fight and imprison the Ebon Maw, greatly weakened, in a place between worlds. And then their cults wiped all mention of Turaglas from the world, so that he might never break free and rise again.<ref>{{Cite dragon/312/The Ebon Maw}}\n\n===U-Z===\n====Ugoreth====\nUgoreth was the ruler of [[Layers_of_the_Abyss#Layer_100:_The_Barrens|The Barrens]], the 100{{th}} layer of the Abyss, before Oublivae killed him.<ref>\n\n====Ungulex====\nUngulex was an obscure demon lord, believed to have been the first demon lord imprisoned in the Wells of Darkness after Ahazu. The shaft of his well was marked only by the occasional echoing sigh.{{Cite dungeon/148/Wells of Darkness|66}}\n\n====Verin====\nVerin,<ref>\n\nIn his travels through the Abyss, Verin catalogued the obsessions and weaknesses of the demon lords and set his master's enemies at each other's throats. For these purposes, he assumed various disguises, most notably a black-skinned mirror of his true form that went by the name Ztefano, who was a welcome guest wherever Verin was not trusted. Ztefano was just as brilliant a diplomat as Verin, but he specialized in fueling schisms and wars rather than alliances.\n\n====Volisupula====\nVolisupula, called The Flensed Marquesse, was a demon lord associated with finery and ostentatious ceremony. He ruled the eighth layer of the Abyss, called [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 8: The Skin-shedder|The Skin-shedder]]. On occasion, he was known to have visited [[Sigil]].<ref>\n\n====Voroxid====\nVoroxid was a minor demon lord of poisonous bones and teeth. His true name could be found in a copy of the Demonomicon of Iggwilv.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/148/Wells of Darkness|81}}\n\n====Xazivort====\nXazivort was a powerful tanar'ri lord who had an ongoing enmity with the Oerthian deity Pholtus. He was cunning and capable of possessing people.<ref>\n\n====Xinivrae====\nXinivrae was a succubus-turned-demon lord who reveled in the seduction of women and was once one of the primary contestants for the title \"Queen of the Succubi\" before she fell to a horrid wound from Malcanthet's lash and was cast by her into the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 230: The Dreaming Gulf|Dreaming Gulf]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/353/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Malcanthet: Queen of the Succubi|27}} It was possible that after Shami-Amourae escaped her imprisonment, she retrieved and allied with Xinivrae in a plot against Malcanthet.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/150/Prince of Demons|96}}<!--Mentioned in Ashes of the Tyrant, but there is not enough information for an article-->\n\n====Vucarik====\nVucarik, the Consort of Chains, was a demon lord associated with chains and torture. He ruled over [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 651: Nethuria|Nethuria]]. He was humanoid in shape but covered by rust-darkened chains that wrapped around him. However, he was known to roam the Abyss at the head of a battalion, always preceded by loud metallic rattlings, inflicting the tintinnabulous word of the Consort of Chains on any who would listen. Occasionally, it was rumored, Vucarik hired those he ran across on his wanderings as heralds, rather than just killing them. A baatezu text called Deceptions and Stratagems linked Vucarik with the [[kyton]]s, but other sources said he was one of the sons of [[Pale Night]].\n\n====Wejindhastala====\nWejindhastala the Tempest was one of the seven demon lords who allied to bring down [[the Malgoth]], but who fell in the process as they were killed or imprisoned by opportunistic rivals.\n\n====Yibyiru====\nYibyiru, called The Rancid Lady of Bitter Bile, was a demon lord associated with poison. She lived in [[Shedaklah]]. She was a demented, simpering creature with poisonous skin who acted as both chambermaid and majordomo to [[Zuggtmoy]]. When Zuggtmoy was away, in fact, Yibyiru was the one charged with keeping that layer safe, and her rage and poisons, which were potent enough to harm even other demons, proved more than up to the task, even to the point of keeping [[Juiblex]] in check. The foul-mouthed and fouler-smelling demon lord was also said variously to be either Zuggtmoy's daughter or senile mother.<ref>{{Cite dragon/337/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Zuggtmoy: Queen of Fungi|48}}\n\n====Yrsillar====\nYrsillar, called the Lord of Nothing, was the ruler of a type of demon called [[dread (demon)|dread]]s. He had a strong tie to the [[Negative Energy plane]] and ruled over the Abyssal layer called Belistor.<ref>{{Cite dragon/277/Rogues Gallery: The Heroes of Shadow's Witness|104}}\n\n====Zanassu====\n{{Main|Zanassu}}\nZanassu, called The Spider Demon, was a dead demon lord once associated with spiders and aranea.<ref>\n\n====Zivorgian====\nZivorgian, called the Lady of Ripe Carrion, was said to be one of the daughters of [[Pale Night]]. She was a bloated, three-headed horror said to vaguely resemble both a vulture and an angel.\n\n====Zuregurex====\nZuregurex, called the Lord of the Drowned, was a demon lord associated with storms and the drowned dead. He once desired the waters of the [[Gaping Maw]], [[Demogorgon]]'s layer, and invaded it while the Prince of Demons was invading [[Hollow's Heart]]. He lead an army of undead and demonically-fused air elementals in an attack on Lemoriax, and was just dismantling the gates the palace Ungorth Reddik when a furious Demogorgon returned. So enraged was Demogorgon at being both torn away from a near-sure victory against [[Fraz-Urb'luu]] and at having his home defaced that he not only slaughtered Zuregurex's army, but also pursued the lesser demon lord all the way back his own layer of [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 480: Guttlevetch|Guttlevetch]]. He invaded the layer, a place of hurricanes and shipwrecks and blood-soaked beaches, and turned the waters against Zuregurex and sunk islands. The Lord of the Drowned was forced to flee to a different layer, [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 245: The Scalding Sea|The Scalding Sea]]. Guttlevetch remained in ruins and Zuregurex in hiding, although there were whispers that he had returned to Guttlevetch in secret to begin rebuilding.<ref>{{Cite dragon/357/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Demogorgon: Prince of Demons|24-25}}\n\n====Zzyczesiya====\nZzyczesiya,<ref> called The Ungrasped, was a demon lord associated with confused and malevolent ignorance. He dwelled in [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 3: The Forgotten Land|The Forgotten Land]]. He was also one of the few entities to have escaped from the Wells of Darkness. It was incredibly obscure thanks to its choice of home layer, and it was said to revel in its anonymity. The more suspicious of those who sought the secrets of the Forgotten Land believed that Zzyczesiya knew a secret of great importance and had taken refuge there to avoid inquirers, and to eventually free itself of the terrible responsibility of the knowledge by forgetting it.<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/Fiendish Codex I, Part 2: The Lost Annals/Additional Layers}}",
