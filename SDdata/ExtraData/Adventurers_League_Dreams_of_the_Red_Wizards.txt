The Dreams of the Red Wizards storyline modules are primarily set surrounding, on, or within the waters of the Sea of Fallen Stars. A linked but separate story arc takes new players to the Sea of Swords, loosely linked to the nautical themes of Ghosts of Saltmarsh, and another linked story arc takes players to Xorvintroth following events of the Plague of Ancients season of Adventurers League modules.
