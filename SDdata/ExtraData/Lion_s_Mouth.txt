The Lions Mouth was a secret ritual held in the Lions Shrine of the fortress of Sarahin.
Holy slayers of the Everlasting undertook this ritual to prove their courage to their superiors. The ritual occurred in a pit housing a fully-grown lioness, though the exact nature and events of the ritual were a secret.
