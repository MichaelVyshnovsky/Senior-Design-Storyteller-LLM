A '''forge chant''' was a kind of cooperative [[spell]] used only by [[dwarves]].

==Powers==
Forge chants were long and difficult to use in combat, but were all cooperative spells that could be bolstered by the singing of dwarves.{{cite dragon/245/The Heart of the Forge|27-28}}

==Users==
There were two kinds of dwarves who could employ forge chants. [[Forge priest]]s were one kind, and they could use any such spell; other dwarves could still access forge chants, but they needed to be quite skilled at singing. Those dwarves who were skilled at singing could only access the least of all chants, basically just ''[[hammer (chant)|hammer]]'' and ''[[miner's chant]]'', on their own. However, through the ''hammer'' chant, up to seven singers could combine their powers, accessing a variety of forge chants. These spells were never useable by nondwarves.
