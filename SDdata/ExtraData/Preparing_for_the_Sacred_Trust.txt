Preparing for the Sacred Trust was a book written by Starweaver Deinyn Fembrys, a priest of the Temple of Mystra in Wheloon in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR.
He read from the book for his sermons in the so-called Mystras Sacred Trust rite held at the temple. Essentially, in it, he claimed that, as shown on Mystras holy symbol, magic was born between the stars, with the stars themselves being the known points or schools of magic, and that the space between contained far more secret magical knowledge that Mystra would only reveal to the most promising.
Full of religious iconography and symbology, the book was very difficult to follow, even incomprehensible, being as it was written by a madman. In fact, Starweaver Fembrys was a false priest, a cleric of Shar who employed the Shadow Weave.
It was a large tome bound in black leather, with the cover bearing an illustration of seven stars.
