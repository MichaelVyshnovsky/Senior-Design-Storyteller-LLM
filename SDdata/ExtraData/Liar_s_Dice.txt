==Background==
Liar's Dice was a very random game. It involved the gamblers rolling five [[dice]] in a cup and then covering the results with it. Each player then peeked under their cup at the dice roll they had received and bet against other players based on what they had rolled. Winning the game was largely dependent upon the gamblers bidding on the dice under their cup, bluffing, and reading the "tells" of others at the table.
