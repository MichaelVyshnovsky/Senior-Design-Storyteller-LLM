{{Quote|Even in death, each creature plays its part in maintaining the Great Balance. But now an imbalance grows, a force that seeks to hold sway over nature...we seek mainly to protect and educate, to preserve the Great Balance, but there are times when we must rise up against danger and
eradicate it.|The archdruid Safhran.}}

==Activities==
Archdruids were different in that they strived to maintain the balance of nature with regards to the [[alignment|moral and ethical perspectives]] of others. They spent much of their time traveling across their lands, to fully understand the creatures, people, and magical power that resided within.

Each druidic circle could only maintain three separate archdruids. Such was the case in the [[Cloak Wood]] forest ''circa'' the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Powers==
They were exceptionally powerful shapeshifters and could take on the form of powerful beasts or [[elemental]]s numerous,
