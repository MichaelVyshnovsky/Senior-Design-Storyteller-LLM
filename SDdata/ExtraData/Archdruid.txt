The title of Archdruid was bestowed upon certain powerful druids that took on additional responsibilities within their given druidic circle.
Archdruids were different in that they strived to maintain the balance of nature with regards to the moral and ethical perspectives of others. They spent much of their time traveling across their lands, to fully understand the creatures, people, and magical power that resided within.
Each druidic circle could only maintain three separate archdruids. Such was the case in the Cloak Wood forest circa the midâ€“14 century DR.
They were exceptionally powerful shapeshifters and could take on the form of powerful beasts or elementals numerous,
Archdruids were considered higher-ranking than other druids, but not held in as high esteem as great druids.
