        "mainbody": "he three Fields of Mythal were the way the powerful arcanists of Netheril grouped their spells, similar to the nine schools of magic known to the wizards of later ages. Each arcanist was a specialist in one Field, had minor insight into a second and could not cast spells from the third Field.\nInventives were spells broadly used to create or destroy. It contained evocations, physical abjurations, summoning conjurations, physical necromancy, and certain transmutations. A specialist in this Field was called an inventor.\nMentalisms were spells designed to influence the perceptions, minds, and souls of creatures. It included spiritual necromancy, visual and mental illusions, enchantments, and divination spells. They were used by mentalists.\nVariations were spells that changed and transformed things, energies and states, including other spells. It contained transmutations, dimensional conjurations, chronomancy, metamagic, and certain evocations. A specialist in this Field was called a variator."
