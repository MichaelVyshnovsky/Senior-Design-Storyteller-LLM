        "Effects": "The Darkening caused dark roiling clouds of a foul, smoke-like substance to cover the sky above the Silver Marches. During the day, this hid the [[sun]], reducing daylight to the equivalent of a [[moon]]less night. At night, the stars were hidden completely.",

While casting the spell, Tsabrak was said to have served as a conduit of [[Lolth]], On [[Midsummer]] night of the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, [[Gromph Baenre]], in an act of rebellion against Lolth and his sister Quenthel, [[counterspell]]ed the Darkening, making it appear as if [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] was channelling the power of his goddess [[Mielikki]] to do so.<ref>",
