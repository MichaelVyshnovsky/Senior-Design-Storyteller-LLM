        "Powers": "Druids could take on their wild shape form twice per day, until they rested their body for a limited time. They could only take on the form of a beast that they had seen in person, or were otherwise familiar with. Once transformed, druids could retain their wild shape form for one or more hours, depending on the power they possessed. They could revert to their natural form at will, a process that was near-instantaneous, or when knocked unconscious or slain.\n\nDuring their wild shape transformation, druids maintained their natural personality and intellectual characteristics. They acquired the same inherent strength and physical characteristics of their new form, and kept any abilities unique to their race, provided their wild shape form could accommodate them.\n\nWhile most druids could not cast [[divine magic]] while in their wild shape form, the most powerful of their ranks developed the means to do so.\n\nDruids that had achieved some means of [[undeath]] could not utilize their ability to wild shape, except in uncommon circumstances that involved tapping into [[necromantic]] energies. Two such entities were the misanthropic [[lich]] [[Lossarwyn]] and the [[Eldathyn]] [[ghost]] named [[Hullack]].",
        "Wild Shapes": {
            "Animal and Beast Forms": "Most druids could wild shape into beasts of the wild, acquiring additional and more menacing features as they improved their druidic powers. Novice druids could transform into small animals like [[cat]]s, [[badger]]s, [[spider]]s, or [[raven]]s, or more powerful beasts like [[wolves]] and [[crocodile]]s. Veteran druids could even take the form of [[giant eagle]]s.\n\n[[Avenger (druid)|Avengers]] could take on additional forms, such as those of a baby [[wyvern]], [[salamander|fire salamander]], or even a [[sword spider]].\n\nSome more benevolent druids could take on the form of [[good]] beasts or [[:category:Celestials|celestial creatures]], such as [[blink dog]]s, [[giant owl]]s, [[pegasi]], and [[unicorn]]s.",
            "Other Forms": "While most druids could only take on the forms of various animals and beasts, some developed techniques that went beyond them. These druids learned how to wild shape into the forms of [[magical beasts]], [[fey]] beasts, swarms of [[:Category:Insects|insect]]s, [[:Category:Plants|plant]]s (such as [[shambling mound]]s), [[elemental]]s, [[aberration]]s, small- or medium-sized [[dragon]]s, or even colossal-sized animals.\n\nDruids from different [[druidic circle]]s could manipulate their wild shape ability in distinct ways. [[Circle of Spores]] druids could ''[[awaken]]'' fungal spores from their body, while old members of the [[Circle of Stars]] in the [[Dalelands]] took on the form of [[constellation]]s made manifest.\n\nDruids of the [[Fangshields]] could wild shape into the forms of other [[humanoid]]s, like [[dwarves]], [[elves]], and [[human]]s."

        "Magical Items": "Certain [[item enchantment|enchanted items]]—referred to as ''[[wild (property)|wild]]'' arms and armor―allowed an individual to retain the item's beneficial properties, even in wild shape form.\n\n''[[Wild shape amulet]]s'' allowed druids to wild shape into mightier creatures, as if they possessed more potent druidic powers.\n\n''[[Necklace of Nature's Teeth]]'' were a variety of jewelry that allowed druids to take on additional wild shape forms, depending on the type of animal whose teeth were used in its formation.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "It was said by some that druids' power to wild shape originated from an enigmatic [[nature spirit]] known as the Primal Beast.",
