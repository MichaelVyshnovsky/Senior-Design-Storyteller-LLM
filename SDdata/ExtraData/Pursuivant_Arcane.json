They could cast any spell they knew as such a free spell, without choosing ahead of time or memorizing their only limitation was that they could use only two attack spells, two defensive spells, and two divination spells a day.\nFinally, they could talk to Azuth or Mystra, asking them to manifest. Doing this without a pressing reason was a bad idea, however, and even saving ones life wasnt always good enough a reason.\nA Pursuivant Arcane who announced their status lost it immediately, manifesting a ring of black flames as a visual marker.\nCategoryYear of Miracles\nCategoryMagic\nCategoryTitles\nhz3tx43r4lk0qnw3q1plyhlub1pcsrw"
