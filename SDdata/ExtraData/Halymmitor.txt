Halymmitor was a homesteading clan to the west of the Lake of Snows in the early 12 century DR. Olohmber Starnardyn took an interest in this clan during his tenure as the Magister, noting that some of their members had psionic wild talents and that their ancestors were mages. He meant to find out if their descendants would have stronger and more reliable psionic talent after some time playing matchmaker with subtle spells, the Magister became convinced that talent for magic was inheritable for those families.The source makes references to both sorcery and psionic talent, but mentions conclusions for sorcery only.
