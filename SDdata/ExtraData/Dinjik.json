        "mainbody": "injik was a technique for hunting foxes and wolves employed by the Iulutiun of the Great Glacier.\nA dinjik was specialized pit trap. It was a snowhouse constructed in the shape of a dome, standing approximately  tall. A square opening was carefully carved into the top and covered with delicate branches and a layer of snow. Within the snowhouse, enticing bait such as fresh seal meat was strategically placed. Tempted by the scent, a wolf or fox would unknowingly step onto the concealed opening, causing it to plummet into the snowhouse. The trapped animal found itself unable to leap out, as the height of the hole was insurmountable, and the curved walls prevented any escape by climbing."
