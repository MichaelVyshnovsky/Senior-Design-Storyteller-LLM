        "mainbody": "'''Contact''' was a fundamental [[psionic]] power or skill of the [[telepathy]] [[discipline]]. It formed a conduit for telepathic exchange necessary for many other psionic powers and for psionic combat. [[Telepath]]s were masters of mental contact.",
        "Effects": "The formal contact skill allowed a psionics-user to learn and use the standard psionic attacks needed to engage in psionic combat and open a closed mind to other powers. In a more general sense, \"contact\" referred to the application of a psionic power to a mind that had been opened, whether voluntarily or forcibly.\n\nJust as the word implied, it made contact between the mind of the telepath and a target creature. It did not itself permit communication, only formed the conduit for telepathic exchange. Targets had to be known to the psionicist, in sight or in knowledge, and were contacted individually, but multiple contacts could be maintained. It became most costly to contact targets the further they were apart (no more than 10,000 miles or 16,093 kilometer if not seen), if they could not be seen by either sight or another power, if they were very intelligent or knew many languages, if they were non-intelligent animals or not mammalian, or if they resisted. An untrained target could make contact harder by filling their mind with nonsense and emotion, such as yelling battle cries, repeating a poem or song, or sticking fingers in their ears and yelling. If they focused all their attention on this, they might fully resist the contact, but performing other actions left \"holes\" in this crude psychic defense. A psionicist or psionic creature had \"closed\" minds, which were automatically protected against contact, even when asleep or unconscious. They needed to deliberately drop their defenses to allow contact, and could choose which contacts to accept. If they did resist, contact could only be made via the psionic attacks, and they could also apply psionic defenses to prevent contact.\n\nMaking and maintaining contact both cost psionic energy, but the energy of other psionic powers used via the contact could be used to maintain the contact. A psionicist maintaining contact could perform other actions while they did. Once made, contact could be maintained over any distance, but not past the limit of a [[crystal sphere]].\n\nWithin psionic combat between psionicists and psionic creatures, there were degrees of partial contact known as \"tangents\", made each time a psionic attack succeeded or overcame a psionic defense. A single tangent was commonly called \"one-finger contact\", two tangents were called \"two-finger contact\", and three tangents established full contact, in which case tangents were no longer required. (there was no \"three-finger contact\"). The contacted mind lay vulnerable to many psionic powers.\n\nContact was broken when a mind was re-closed or when the psionicist making contact ended it or failed to maintain it through distraction or lack of psionic energy. A contacted psionicist could also attempt to [[ejection|eject]] the one contacting them, but this was risky.\n\nIf contact was attempted against a [[wizard]] using the ''[[mislead]]'' [[spell]], it would fail automatically, but the psionicist would also immediately notice the deception.\n\nContact also allowed a psionics-user to identify and even manifest psionic powers known by another psionic creature and even ''power stones''. With another being, this required physical contact for several seconds, and if the one attempting contact had sufficient skill, they identified powers up to their own capacity and could manifest it themselves. Contacting a power stone, otherwise known as \"addressing\" it, was similar and was necessary to identify and manifest the powers it held.",
        "Displays": "A contact had a physical [[display|manifestation]], with recipients reporting sensing it as a \"heavy spot\" or \"thick spot\" somewhere in the mind, though they were unable to locate it exactly within their skull. Contacts made by psionic combat were much more intense; [[Bezelar Mujarif]] described a tangent as feeling \"like a gallstone in the mind\" and full contact as \"like a tiger has unsheathed its claws in your head\".",
        "Usage": "The contact skill was required to learn and use the five psionic attacks:\n\nIt was essential to establish contact with another creature's mind before the use of almost any telepathic power. Provided contact was made and maintained, a psionicist could use these other powers and change one power for another.\n\nContact was necessary for many psionic powers, such as ''[[psionic dominate|domination]]'', ''[[identity penetration]]'', ''[[mindlink]]'', and ''[[telepathic projection]]'', among many others.",
        "Users": "[[Psionicist]]s learned the contact skill automatically, with no additional effort, while beings with wild talents had to train specifically in it.\n\nContact was known innately by [[intellect devourer]]s and their larval form, [[ustilagor]], by lesser and greater [[shedu]], and by [[haun]].<ref>",
        "Significance": "On [[Mirtul 5]], duergar practitioners of psionics gathered in temples to Deep Duerra to perform a psionic ritual called [[the Melding]], in which they made contact with the goddess herself. They formed a powerful communal mind, giving them great insights leading to advances in psionics, tactics, and technology.",
        "Notable Wild Talents": "The contact skill was inherent to all psionicists, psionics-users, and psionic creatures. The following people knew it as a wild talent:<ref group=\"note\">In ''The Complete Psionics Handbook'', a character with a wild talent for a telepathy power requiring contact automatically learned contact in order to use it. The following characters most likely learned it this way, but this was superseded in ''Player's Option: Skills & Powers''. They are retained here for interest.\n* [[Gayrlana]], \"Lady Bloodsword\", leader of the [[Mindulgulph Mercenary Company]], had a psionic talent for ''contact''.\n* [[Winestab]], a thief of [[Waterdeep]]<ref>"
