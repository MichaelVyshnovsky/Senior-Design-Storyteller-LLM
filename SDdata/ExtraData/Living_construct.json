        "mainbody": "A living construct was a type of construct that combined elements of animated constructs and living creatures. They possessed free will and sentience given to them by the complex and potent magic employed in their creation.\nAs sentient beings, living constructs could train and develop their skills and abilities in any way open to them.\nWhile they had a lot of traits in common with standard constructs, they had some differences too.\nUnlike constructs, they had a vitality and fortitude that didnt depend on their mass and size. This meant they could be affected by spells that targeted living creatures as well as those that targeted constructs. They could suffer from blows that wearied them or hit critical parts, effects that deteriorated their physical or mental abilities, effects that required fortitude to resist, and be affected by death magic and other necromancy, but some were resistant. Some remained immune, or to disease, nausea, and poison to fatigue and sleep magic to paralysis and to their energy being drained. They could also be affected by mind-affecting magic.\nHowever, they could not heal damage naturally. Rather, they needed to be repaired physically. They could be healed by spells of the cure wounds family and other healing spells, but these had only half their normal effect, while repair damage spells had their full effect. If they seriously damaged, they fell inert and did not lay dying. In particular, if fully destroyed, they could be resurrected with raise dead or resurrection.\nThey lacked darkvision or low-light vision by virtue of being a construct. They could move freely and were capable of running.\nWhile they did not require organic sustenance (whether food, drink, or air), they could make use of magical consumables like potions and heroes feast. They had no need of sleep, but did require a form of rest for a night prior to preparing any spells, and only needed four hours of such rest to be ready for anything else.\n* Merchurion\n* Warforged\n* Basal golemIn Blood & Magic materials, the basal golem is described as a \"living golem\", implied to be spiritual and intelligent, and can turn into living creatures. This seems to fit the terms of a living construct, though this classification was invented eight years later for other creatures in D&D, namely the surprisingly similar warforged of the Eberron setting. Therefore, this article assumes the basal golem is a living construct.\n* The JuggernautIn Blood & Magic, it is said that the Pearl of Power can \"bring life to arcane inventions\" and the Juggernaut is described as coming alive. It is also described as a \"beast\" with \"innards\" as well as a \"machine\" and \"device\". While this may just be descriptiveness, it also seems to fit the terms of a living construct, like the basal golems. Therefore, this article assumes the Juggernaut is a living construct."
