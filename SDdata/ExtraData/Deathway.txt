The '''''deathways''''' were a network of [[portal]]s linking crypts, catacombs, graveyards and other such places related to the [[Eminence of Araunt]], across the continents of [[Laerakond]] and [[Faerûn]], and between the worlds of [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]].

==Description==
The ''deathways'' were a place located in between the [[Shadowfell]] and the [[Prime Material Plane]], and connected to tombs, crypts, catacombs, graveyards and such other places across the [[multiverse]], in arches or doors that were marked above them with the sign of the Eminence, three vertical slashes. Although those places were normal tombs or crypts for the unwary people, for those intelligent [[undead]] who knew the significance of the sign, or for the few living agents who worked for the Eminence, those places became portals that linked to everyone of the "principalities" of the Eminence across Abeir, and later Toril.

==History==
The origins of the ''deathways'' were unknown. According to the [[demon]] [[Sarshethrian]], who was trapped in the ''deathways'' ever since his birth, and was possibly created by them, the place had just existed since always.

It was [[Lod]], the founder of the Eminence, the one who discovered how to connect the ''deathways'' with the Prime Material Plane, about five hundred years before [[1479 DR]], while he was in the world of Abeir. Lod recorded the way of creating entries to the ''deathways'' in his ''[[Codex of Araunt]]''.

Initially, the ''deathways'' linked only places within the world of Abeir and the continent of Laerakond, but in the decade of the [[1470 DR|1470s DR]], the ''deathways'' began to spread across Faerûn, as far as [[Thay]]. Since then, the ''deathways'' began to spread across all over the world at an astounding rate.
