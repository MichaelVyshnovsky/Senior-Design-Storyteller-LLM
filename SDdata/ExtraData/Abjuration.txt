thumb|Aburation spell being cast.
The abjuration school of magic encompassed protective spells, though some of them have aggressive uses. They created physical or magical barriers, negated magical or physical abilities, harmed trespassers, or even banished the subject of the spell to another plane of existence. The abjuration school had no subschools. A wizard who specialized in abjuration was known as an abjurer.
Some abjuration spells included antimagic field, dispel magic and resist energy.
