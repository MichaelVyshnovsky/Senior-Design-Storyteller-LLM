When they dedicated themselves to the tenets of this oath, they also were granted access to a set of [[spell]]s at no cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).",
        "Oath of Redemption Spells": "Paladins that had recently taken such as oath could cast ''[[sanctuary]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', ''[[calm emotions]]'', as well as ''[[hold person]]''. Adept paladins could cast ''[[counterspell]]'', ''[[hypnotic pattern]]'', ''[[Otiluke's resilient sphere]]'', ''[[stoneskin]]''. Very versed bearers of such an oath could cast ''[[hold monster]]'' and ''[[wall of force]]''.",
