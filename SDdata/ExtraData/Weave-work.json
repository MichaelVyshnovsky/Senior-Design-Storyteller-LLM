        "Casters": "Users of arcane magic capable of Weave-work could see and feel the Weave itself; they could manipulate and direct its flow by their sheer will and competence, without the need of rigid structures like spells.\n\nUsers of Weave-work could also perceive certain qualities of the Weave, such as color and movement, that were meaningless to other spellcasters, but useful to determine how to obtain the best results with magic.",
        "Effects": "Weave-work granted vast flexibility and power in the creation of magical effects, as it was able to produce anything a spell could, without being limited by the need to learn and perform complex rituals to obtain fixed effects. However, it was far more exhausting than normal casting.\n\nWhile it didn't require any words, gestures, or material components, Weave-work wasn't subtle in appearance. When a mage prepared to perform Weave-work, and reached into the Weave, their eyes could be seen flaring up with arcane energies, and their hair stirred and moved around, as if under the effect of an invisible force. However, some users, like [[Elminster Aumar]] learned to hide such evident signals.",
