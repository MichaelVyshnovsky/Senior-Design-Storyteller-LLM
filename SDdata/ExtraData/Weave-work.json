However, it was far more exhausting than normal casting.\nWhile it didnt require any words, gestures, or material components, Weave-work wasnt subtle in appearance. When a mage prepared to perform Weave-work, and reached into the Weave, their eyes could be seen flaring up with arcane energies, and their hair stirred and moved around, as if under the effect of an invisible force. However, some users, like Elminster Aumar learned to hide such evident signals.\n* Elminster Aumar\n* Laeral Silverhand\nCategoryMagic\nrts393ceeid1krsj71ltnm289dgpaun"
