        "History": "For many decades, the Red Rysal, clad in red leather, had defended the common folk of Teshburl against abuses of power among the rich and corrupt merchants, guildmasters, and government officials.\n\nIt was the Red Rysal who uncovered that many of the poor people's children were being kidnapped by the priests and clerics of many of the evil temples in the city, such as those dedicated to [[Bane]] or [[Cyric]], and then sold into slavery. Once this terrible news came out, there was a massive city uprising, and most of the temples in Teshburl were burned to the ground.\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], the Red Rysal's true identity remained a mystery to most. Some thought he was a [[genie]].\n\nIn truth, the Red Rysal was not a single person but rather a title passed down from one person to another, and there were usually two Red Rysals operating at the same time. By 1370, there had been sixteen Red Rysals in total, most of whom were from the [[el Ehrat]] family, a clan of weaponsmiths. Some were [[wizard]]s, and others were [[rogue]]s or [[fighter]]s, which served to enhance the confusion about the Red Rysal's abilities.",
