Once this terrible news came out, there was a massive city uprising, and most of the temples in Teshburl were burned to the ground.\nBy 1370 DR, the Red Rysals true identity remained a mystery to most. Some thought he was a genie.\nIn truth, the Red Rysal was not a single person but rather a title passed down from one person to another, and there were usually two Red Rysals operating at the same time. By 1370, there had been sixteen Red Rysals in total, most of whom were from the el Ehrat family, a clan of weaponsmiths. Some were wizards, and others were rogues or fighters, which served to enhance the confusion about the Red Rysals abilities.\n* Rysal Dumahl el Ehrat&mdashthe first Red Rysal.\n* Baral el Ehrat&mdashwas killed while in the role.\n* Kanar yn Baral el Ehrat&mdashBarals son.\nIn 1370 DR, the former jhasin and amlak officer, Oadif el Wajin was being considered for the role.\nCategoryTitles\nqjqeibsmb1434pgwf0g638vpfn4x6q3"
