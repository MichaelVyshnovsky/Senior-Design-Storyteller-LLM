So far, details about the island itself, its geography, rulers, and society have been sketchy. It is known that Evermeet is protected by illusory magic, that ships lose their way or vanish mysteriously if they approach the isle, and that the elven navy is the finest in the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]]. Past publications have also revealed that Evermeet is ruled by Queen [[Amlaruil]], and that her husband [[Zaor]] was murdered decades ago. Beyond this, little is known.''}}
