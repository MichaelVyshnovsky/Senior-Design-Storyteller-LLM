A changeland was a generic term adopted in the 15 century DR to refer to any magical geographic area or feature that did not fit with the surrounding terrain, generally as a leftover of the cataclysmic effects of the Spellplague. 
Examples of changelands included lands torn to pieces by the Spellplague&mdashproducing both earthmotes and chasms. More broadly, any geographic change brought about by the Spellplague could be called a changeland. This included
* The elevated Thayan Plateau
* The Underchasm
* The ruination of Unther
* The Bonedark Hills on the border of Thesk and Thay
