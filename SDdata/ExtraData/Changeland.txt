A '''changeland''' was a generic term adopted in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] to refer to any [[magic]]al geographic area or feature that did not fit with the surrounding terrain, generally as a leftover of the cataclysmic effects of the [[Spellplague]].{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Year of the Ageless One}} 

==Notable Changelands==
Examples of changelands included lands torn to pieces by the Spellplague&mdash;producing both [[earthmote]]s and chasms. More broadly, any geographic change brought about by the Spellplague could be called a changeland. This included:
* The elevated [[Thayan Plateau]]
* The [[Underchasm]]
* The ruination of [[Unther]]
* The [[Bonedark Hills]] on the border of [[Thesk]] and [[Thay]]
