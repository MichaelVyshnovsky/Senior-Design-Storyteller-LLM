        "mainbody": "the various [[cosmologies]] and [[schools of magic]] on [[Toril]], an '''element''' was one of the fundamental building blocks of the universe. The elements, together with the two energies, [[positive energy]] and [[negative energy]], composed everything that existed on the [[Material Plane]]. On the Material Plane, the elements were roughly in balance; whereas, on the [[Inner Planes]], one element or energy dominated over the others.\n\nDifferent cultures counted the elements differently. In [[Faer√ªn]], four elements were acknowledged&mdash;[[air]], [[Earth (element)|earth]], [[fire]], and [[water]]. [[Zakhara]]n sages recognized the same four elements but named them [[Air|wind]], [[Earth (element)|sand]], [[Fire|flame]], and [[Water|sea]], respectively. The sages of [[Kara-Tur]], in contrast, held that there were ''five'' elements, not four. These were fire, [[Earth (element)|metal]], water, wind, and [[wood]].<ref group=\"note\">In the real world, in [[wikipedia:Wuxing (Chinese philosophy)|Chinese philosophy]], the five elements are earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. In [[wikipedia:Godai (Japanese philosophy)|Japanese philosophy]], the five elements are earth, fire, water, wind, and void (or ether), which correspond exactly to the Western [[wikipedia:Classical elements|classical elements]]. In 1{{st}} edition, the ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' sourcebook provides the five elements of fire, metal, water, wind, and wood, which does not match either the Chinese or Japanese list. The 3{{rd}}-edition [[Oriental Adventures (3rd edition)|''Oriental Adventures'']] sourcebook appears to \"correct\" this by listing the five elements as the Chinese list of earth, fire, metal, water, and wood. However, 3{{rd}}-edition ''Oriental Adventures'' is not a Forgotten Realms sourcebook, so this wiki lists the five [[Kara-Tur]]an elements originally provided in the 1{{st}}-edition sourcebook. [[Wu-jen]] in that land could master one of these five elements."
