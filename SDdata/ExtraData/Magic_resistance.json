        "mainbody": "agic resistance was an innate ability that could prevent magic from taking effect on a creature or person.\nVarious creatures steeped in magic, like the drow and most dragons and fiends, possessed magic resistance, as did strongly anti-magical ones. The likelyhood to negate any one spell or effect varied widely between different species.\nCertain magical items, like a potion of magic resistance or robe of the archmagi, also granted this ability.\nThe pluma spell also named magic resistance was used to cancel magic in a limited area, but worked technically closer to an anti-magic shell.\nThe spells lower resistance, pierce magic resistance and pierce any shield on the other hand were designed to improve the chance to overcome creatures innate resistance against magic."
