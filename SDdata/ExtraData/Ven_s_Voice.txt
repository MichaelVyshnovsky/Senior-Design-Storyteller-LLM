The '''Ven's Voice''' was the title of the chief advisor and spokesperson of the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]].

The Ven's Voice was elected by the members of the [[Council (Tsurlagol)|Council]], consisting of Tsurlagol's highest [[noble]]s and leading [[merchant]] lords, from among their number. The Voice served as a spokesperson both for the Council and for the [[Ven]], the secret ruler of the city. The Voice was also chief advisor to the Ven and announced the Ven's decrees to the people of Tsurlagol. As such, in many ways, the Voice could often be more powerful than the Ven themself. This position was not a secret one.

By [[1367 DR]] until [[1370 DR]] and after, the Ven's Voice was the ambitious [[Conoptora Billon]].
