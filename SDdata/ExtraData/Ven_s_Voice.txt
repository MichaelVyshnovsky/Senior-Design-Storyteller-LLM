The Vens Voice was the title of the chief advisor and spokesperson of the city of [[Tsurlagol in the Vast.
The Vens Voice was elected by the members of the Council, consisting of Tsurlagols highest nobles and leading merchant lords, from among their number. The Voice served as a spokesperson both for the Council and for the Ven, the secret ruler of the city. The Voice was also chief advisor to the Ven and announced the Vens decrees to the people of Tsurlagol. As such, in many ways, the Voice could often be more powerful than the Ven themself. This position was not a secret one.
By 1367 DR until 1370 DR and after, the Vens Voice was the ambitious Conoptora Billon.
