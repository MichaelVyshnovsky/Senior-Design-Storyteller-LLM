'''Sixtrumpets''' was the site of a battle between [[Amn]] and [[Waterdeep]] in {{yearlink|1321}}.{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|2|Realmslore}}It is assumed for the purposes of this article that by virtue of being "fresh", the battles will have occurred at most three months prior. Eleint being the eighth month of the calendar of Harptos, it is thus concluded that the battles most likely occurred the same year.
==History==
As of [[Eleint 6]] {{yearlink|1321}}, [[Mirt the Merciless]] had returned to [[Waterdeep]], fresh from battling the forces of [[Amn]] at Sixtrumpets and by the [[Winding Water]].{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|95|6}}
