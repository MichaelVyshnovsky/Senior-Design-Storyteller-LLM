Intellect fortress was a psionic devotion of the telepathy discipline that allowed the psionicist to envelop their mind in protective psychic energy.
An intellect fortress excelled at protecting the mind against an ego whip attack but was susceptible to a psionic blast.
* Vhondryl, a psionicist in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor
