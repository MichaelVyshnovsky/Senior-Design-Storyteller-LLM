        "mainbody": "The Decree of Reception was a law enacted in Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the late 14 century DR that allowed orcs free passage and rights in the city.\nDuring the Gray Migrations of the High Forest orcs across the Delimbiyr Vale in the summer of the , They settled in and around the city, establishing a shanty town in the south outside the Forestview Gate, and took menial jobs to make enough coin to support their tribes.\nThen, one evening only two bells after sunset, a pair of orcs were slain in the street outside the Red Boar Tavern. Though this was the busiest time for the tavern, somehow, the authorities could not find one witness to the incident, let alone the killer.\nIn response, High Lord Kalahar Twohands made the Decree of Reception to confirm the rights of the visiting orcs. He also ordered the Loudwater Guard be posted to the Red Boar at all times to ensure peace there, with two guards in the day and four at night.\nIt was intended to mitigate the impact of the Gray Migrations on Loudwater and its lands, but many in the city, both humans and elves, were confused by Kalahars generosity and some disagreed with and even loudly opposed the decree. Although the folk of Loudwater had much tolerance, their old enmities would not fade fast, and many still distrusted and disliked the orcs. While the Decree of Reception was abided by, visiting orcs were often treated coldly and were grudgingly served at the Red Boar. The merchants, of course, appreciated them as a source of cheap labor. The orcs, for their part, remained peaceful and considerate.\nYet six more orcs would be found dead in the neighborhood of the Red Boar, not mutilated and on display, and left with a predictable message \"The only good orcâ€¦\"\nUnder the Decree of Reception, the orcs were permitted to enter Loudwater, were granted rights similar to those of citizens, and were protected under the law, provided they in turn obeyed the law."
