The Temple of Ten Thousand Gods was an unusual faith in Zakhara. Its adherents believed in the enlightened gods, but held the opinion that they, and each deity represented there, were only facets of one supreme divine being. The credo of the Ten Thousand also included that there was a divine spark in every creature, and that the variety of mortals also reflected the theme of diversity in unity.
