The '''Wyverntongue Chalice''' was one of the relics of [[The Nine]]. It contained the spirit of [[Treth Halonter]] who could be called forth by the chalice's owner. Treth's spirit was forced to obey the commands of the owner.  

The chalice was displayed in the royal palace in [[Suzail]] for many years but was stolen as a drunken prank by [[Nethglas Stormserpent]] sometime in the 1470s DR. When the chalice's theft stirred the [[war wizard]]s into a frenzy, Nethglas became worried and stashed the chalice in the [[Chamber of Wyrms Ascending]] in the palace. In [[1479 DR]], his younger brother, [[Marlin Stormserpent|Marlin]], retrieved the chalice from the palace. Marlin called forth Treth and [[Relve Langral]]'s spirit from the [[Flying Blade]] and sent them on a killing spree through Suzail.  

[[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] sought the chalice and the other relics to feed to [[Simbul|Alassra Silverhand]] to restore her sanity.
