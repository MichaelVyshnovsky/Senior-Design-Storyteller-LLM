This is a list of books known to exist in the Realms, with dates (in [[Dalereckoning]]) and authors, if known. The "Original" column indicates if the stored physical work was a copy or not. Many of them could be found in the libraries at [[Candlekeep]], [[Herald's Hall]], the [[Vault of the Sages]], and other repositories.
{{Quote|Books are wonderful. Men dead and dust for centuries can speak to ye across the years, displaying their mistakes and idiocies for all to read—so that new generations can learn to repeat them exactly, or with superb new embellishments of their own.|[[Blackthorn Belgadar]], ''A Merchant's Sagacity''{{Cite dragon/272/The New Adventures of Volo: Quotations of the Realms|94}}}}
{{Quote|I never read. No good comes of reading. If ye don't believe me, look at all the folk ye meet. Mark ye—the ones that read'll be lawyers, priests, or wizards. See what I mean?|[[Dathlyr Greybold|Dathlyr "The Hammer" Greybold]], ''My Adventures in the Realms, Volume I''}}

|''Circa'' 730's BC<ref group="note" name="VanDate">BC stands for Barovian Calendar and is the calendar system used in the [[Domains of Dread]]. Van Richten's birth date is stated to be [[w:c:ravenloft:671 BC|671 BC]] on page 4 of ''[[w:c:ravenloft:Van Richten's Arsenal|Van Richten's Arsenal]]'' and in ''[[Van Richten's Guide to Werebeasts]]'' the author states that he was "born nearly threescore years ago," meaning that the 730's are the most rough approximation that can be given for the book's creation.
