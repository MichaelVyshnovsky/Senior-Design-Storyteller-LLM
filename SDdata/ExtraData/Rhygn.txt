The Rhygn were a warrior culture, ruled by a king, that lived within a valley in the Vast until a foreign power came and conquered their land.
The father of the would-be king Mertwig waged a bloody war with the Rhygn that lasted for two days and a single night, ending in the death of all the Rhygn people. Following this conflict, the Rhygn people were buried within two great mounds.
