        "mainbody": "''Horns of wisdom''''' was a unique [[magic]]al ability used by [[ice hunter shaman]]s, who were [[specialty priest]]s of [[Ulutiu]], of the [[Great Glacier]] whose totem animal was [[Pindalpau-pau|Pindalpau-pau the Reindeer Mother]].",
        "Powers": "''Horns of wisdom'' bestowed the benefits of a ''[[commune]]'' [[spell]] on the shaman. The power also caused elk antlers to grow from their head that got larger with each use of this power. The horns would shed during the winter if they got too big to be supported by the shaman's skull. At this point the growth cycle would begin anew in the spring.\n\n''Horns of wisdom'' could be called upon once per day and lasted for ten minutes."
