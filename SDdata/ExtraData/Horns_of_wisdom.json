        "mainbody": "Horns of wisdom was a unique magical ability used by ice hunter shamans, who were specialty priests of Ulutiu, of the Great Glacier whose totem animal was Pindalpau-pau the Reindeer Mother.\nHorns of wisdom bestowed the benefits of a commune spell on the shaman. The power also caused elk antlers to grow from their head that got larger with each use of this power. The horns would shed during the winter if they got too big to be supported by the shamans skull. At this point the growth cycle would begin anew in the spring.\nHorns of wisdom could be called upon once per day and lasted for ten minutes."
