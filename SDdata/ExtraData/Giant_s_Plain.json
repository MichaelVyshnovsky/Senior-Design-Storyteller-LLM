        "mainbody": "name of these plains has changed at least twice. The first after the impressive rout of the resident [[giants]] by the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of [[High Shanatar]] which slaughtered over 5000 of the creatures in {{Yearlink|-5350}}. The general of that successful army was named [[Karlyn]] and the area was dubbed Karlyn's Vale in his honor. In {{Yearlink|-2600}} the last known surviving descendants of that army were killed by [[human]]s and the name was lost, though a monument to Karlyn still stands in the [[Troll Mountains]] known as the [[Wailing Dwarf]].",
        "Flora & Fauna": "The Giant's Plain was home to large herds of migratory animals that traveled from the [[Western Heartlands]]. These beasts included [[rothé]], [[deer]], and [[boar]]s, that, in turn, served as a food source for the [[Sword Coast]] [[dragon]]s, who considered it to be their \"happy hunting ground.\"{{Cite web/theedverse/2023-01-02 - Migratory Herds}}",
