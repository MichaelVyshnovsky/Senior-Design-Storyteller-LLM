Kappebror (meaning "Cloak Brother" in Jotun) was a firbolg clan in the 14 century DR.
Like many firbolg clans, Kappebror required its members to carry a written form of "the code" (the guiding principles of the firbolgs) on their person. What made Kappebror stand out from other clans that required this, was their tradition of having the code written upon pieces of fine parchment, which were then sealed inside amulets to be worn around members necks.
