        "History": "The [[orc]] kingdom of [[Vastar]] was ruled by an overking. [[Ologh]] the Overking held the position and created a throne himself, but died in [[572 DR]], leaving the position of overking vacant. After a civil war, [[Grimmerfang]] seized the throne but took the title [[Orc-King]] instead.\n\nIn [[1367 DR]], the archmage [[Yuthrygg|Yuthrygg of the Many Miracles]] declared himself overking of [[Tethyr]], but this was contested by [[Galthaunt|Galthaunt the Grimcloak]].\n\nThe same year, the rulers of the cities of [[Chessenta]] considered some joint security measures, including the installation of an overking to protect the nation as a whole. However, they determined that none of them should be raised to overking, and argued over the selection process and possible candidates. Various factions put forth their own candidates.",
