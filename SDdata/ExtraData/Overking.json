Ologh the Overking held the position and created a throne himself, but died in 572 DR, leaving the position of overking vacant. After a civil war, Grimmerfang seized the throne but took the title Orc-King instead.\nIn 1367 DR, the archmage Yuthrygg of the Many Miracles declared himself overking of Tethyr, but this was contested by Galthaunt the Grimcloak.\nThe same year, the rulers of the cities of Chessenta considered some joint security measures, including the installation of an overking to protect the nation as a whole. However, they determined that none of them should be raised to overking, and argued over the selection process and possible candidates. Various factions put forth their own candidates.\nCategoryTitles\nbdaxpdw70hax4rs5z24uzoif6ui1ibf"
