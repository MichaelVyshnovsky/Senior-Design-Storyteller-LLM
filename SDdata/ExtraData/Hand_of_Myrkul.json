        "mainbody": "he hand of Myrkul was a unique power granted by Myrkul, the God of the Dead, to his specialty priests called gray ones.\nPowerful gray ones could invoke the hand of Myrkul only once per tenday under dire circumstances. Flames surrounded the gray ones hands for several minutes, allowing them to instantly slay a single living touched target regardless of the targets size. The body of the slain target was instantly reduced to dust. There was a slim chance the target could resist the magic, turning the life-ending power against the gray one who would either perish or resist as well.\nThe hand of Myrkul was wasted if a target was not touched while the flames remained active. Furthermore, the gray one who summoned the power would never again be able to call upon it unless a wish was used to restore the ability."
