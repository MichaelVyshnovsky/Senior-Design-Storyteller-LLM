'''Petrylloc's Gambit''' was a spellcasting strategy that created various magic walls to surround and fall upon a target, using primarily defensive spells in an offensive manner.

[[Khelben Arunsun]] tried to get his father, [[Arun Maerdrym]], to use the Gambit with him against a group of [[phaerimm]] that were attacking the elder's new [[Elf|elven]] family, but the older mage had no idea what his more educated son meant by the term.

Hundreds of years later, the Gambit was used in a group casting in [[1374 DR]] by Khelben and the wizards [[Sememmon]] and [[Ashemmi]] to defeat a [[sharn]] at the [[Sleeping Dragon]] inn.
