Lake Geneva, WI TSR, 1980.Although there is no mention of Sardior in specific Realms products, according to Ed Greenwood Sardior was worshiped as a god on the Realms.\n*Tamara Goddess of mercy and healers.\n*Task God of greed.\n*Tiamat Goddess of vengeance and evil dragonkind, she was also part of the Untheric pantheon and became a member of the Faerûnian pantheon during the Time of Troubles.\n*Zorquan God of dragonkind and \"dragonness\" (the essence of what it was to be a dragon).\n*Azharul A dragon god who lived in Dragon Eyrie.

According to this theory, she could have had a yellow dragon head (specifically, that of the salt dragon variant), a purple dragon head, an orange dragon head, and perhaps more heads of other colors as well. According to some proponents of this theory, this unnamed goddess was possibly killed by Tiamat in the ancient past.\nSome sages of the 15 century DR believed that the dragon gods werent actually gods, at least in the ontological sense when compared to the gods that hailed from the Outer Planes. According to these sages, who had studied the ancient draconic poem Elegy for the First World, the only dragon gods that were actually \"divine\" in nature where Bahamut and Tiamat, who were the primordial dragons that where born from the Material Plane since the beginning of time. The other members of the pantheon, according to these sages, were mortal dragons who had acquired their greatwyrm status and developed their dragonsight, reaching a sort of apotheosis after joining with many echoes of themselves and/or coordinating their actions with their echoes across the many worlds of the Material plane, gaining godlike powers in the process.\nThe draconic pantheon was one of the oldest pantheons of gods on Toril, being worshiped by dragonkind since the creation of their race around . Dragons of that time were devout followers of their gods, and such devotion sparked intense wars, dubbed as the Draco Holy Wars, over philosophical differences not only between different species but also within species.\nOver time, draconic philosophers came to the conclusion that all of the fighting was wasteful and that gods who allowed such behavior were not worthy of their worship. Whatever the truth, eventually most dragons turned away from the war and from religion in general. This started the dragons apathy toward their gods, which lasted for thousands of years. Only the followers of Bahamut and Tiamat didnt lose their faith toward their gods, and continued fighting in what was known as the Dragonfall War.\nAlthough members of the draconic pantheon had personal lairs and domains in many of the outer planes, their own plane was the Dragon Eyrie. However, this plane was destroyed by the Spellplague in 1385 DR, and the draconic deities drifted to the domains of other gods.\nIt was prophesied among the few remaining worshipers of the draconic gods that a \"Turning of the Great Cycle\"  would foretell the return of religious fervor among dragonkind. That realization sparked the need of dragons to look for the help of their gods, marking the prophesied \"turning\". The dragon gods who survived the long years without worshipers received a great influx of power from their new draconic followers. However, this also threatened Faerûn with the possibility of a new battle in the Dragonfall War."
