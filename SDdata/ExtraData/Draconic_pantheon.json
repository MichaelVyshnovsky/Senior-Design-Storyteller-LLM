        "History": "The draconic pantheon was one of the oldest pantheons of gods on [[Toril]], being worshiped by dragonkind since the creation of their race around {{Yearlink|-30000}}. Dragons of that time were devout followers of their gods, and such devotion sparked intense wars, dubbed as the [[Draco Holy Wars]], over philosophical differences not only between different species but also within species.\n\nOver time, draconic philosophers came to the conclusion that all of the fighting was wasteful and that gods who allowed such behavior were not worthy of their worship. Whatever the truth, eventually most dragons turned away from the war and from religion in general. This started the dragon's apathy toward their gods, which lasted for thousands of years. Only the followers of Bahamut and Tiamat didn't lose their faith toward their gods, and continued fighting in what was known as the [[Dragonfall War]].\n\nAlthough members of the draconic pantheon had personal lairs and domains in many of the [[outer plane]]s, their own plane was the [[Dragon Eyrie]].<ref> However, this plane was destroyed by the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]], and the draconic deities drifted to the domains of other gods.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2015)| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]| topicid    = 19841| postid     = 464818| whichpage  = 7| date       = 2015-02-12| accessdate = 2015-02-16}}<ref>",
        "Turning of the Great Cycle": "It was prophesied among the few remaining worshipers of the draconic gods that a \"''Turning of the Great Cycle''\"  would foretell the return of religious fervor among dragonkind. That realization sparked the need of dragons to look for the help of their gods, marking the prophesied \"turning\". The dragon gods who survived the long years without worshipers received a great influx of power from their new draconic followers. However, this also threatened Faerûn with the possibility of a new battle in the Dragonfall War."
