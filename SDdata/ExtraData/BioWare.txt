'''BioWare Corp''' is a Canadian entertainment software company best known for its roleplaying games, including a number of Forgotten Realms computer game titles.

BioWare was founded in [[Wikipedia:Edmonton|Edmonton]], [[Wikipedia:Canada|Canada]] in 1995 by medical students [[Ray Muzyka]] and [[Greg Zeschuk]]. After initially developing ''[[Wikipedia:Shattered Steel|Shattered Steel]]'' in [[1996]], BioWare went on to develop ''[[Baldur's Gate (game)|Baldur's Gate]]'' for [[Black Isle Studios]] in [[1998]], their first out of many contributions to the Forgotten Realms license. ''Baldur's Gate'' proved to be both a smash success and critically acclaimed and in [[1999]] the developer put out an expansion pack, ''[[Baldur's Gate: Tales of the Sword Coast]]'', followed by a sequel, ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]'' in [[2000]], which was even more acclaimed and acquired another expansion pack, ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal]]'' in [[2001]].

In [[2002]], BioWare released its last stand-alone Forgotten Realms game to date, ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'', which, again, proved a critical and commercial success. BioWare continued support for the game, releasing two story-based expansions (''[[Neverwinter Nights: Shadows of Undrentide]]'' and ''[[Neverwinter Nights: Hordes of the Underdark]]'') as well as several downloadable "premium modules" and the ''[[Neverwinter Nights: Kingmaker]]'' expansion pack. BioWare would later also provide limited oversight over [[Obsidian Entertainment]]'s development of [[Neverwinter Nights 2|the sequel]], released in [[2006]].

In [[2005]], BioWare merged with [[Wikipedia:Pandemic Studios|Pandemic Studios]] which were later both acquired by [[Wikipedia:Electronic Arts|Electronic Arts]] in late [[2007]]. BioWare's most recent release was ''[[Wikipedia:Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening|Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening]]'', an expansion to ''[[Wikipedia:Dragon Age: Origins|Dragon Age: Origins]]'', which BioWare billed as a "spiritual successor" to ''Baldur's Gate''.
