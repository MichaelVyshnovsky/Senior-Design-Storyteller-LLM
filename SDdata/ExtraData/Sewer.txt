'''Sewers''', also known as '''sewer systems''', were underground pipe or tunnel systems built beneath cities for the purpose of transporting away wastewater or "sewage" to somewhere else for disposal or treatment.{{Cite web/theedverse/2017-07-31 - Sewer Technology}} These were essential to most large civilized settlements, as not disposing of wastewater could create a breeding ground for [[disease]]s.<ref>

{{quote|Belike you keep a [[chamberpot|pot]] by your bedside and cast out the leavings into a communal pit of a morn... Many cities have dispensed with such simple methods of [[hygiene|hygienic]] living, and instead the waste of inhabitants comingles and flows through great channels beneath the very streets.|An excerpt from ''[[Lessons for Sensible Living|Lessons for Sensible Living IV: Cities and How to Survive Them]]''.}}

==Construction==
Sewers were often dug and constructed as cities were planned and built. In the case of rather older cities, sewers may have been excavated after their street layouts were already in place.

Some cities sported sewers that were, in part, the repurposed structures of older cities they were built atop of. Such examples of this included the former city of [[Sarbreen]] beneath [[Ravens Bluff]]<ref> and the former [[deep gnome]] city that [[Calimport]] stood atop of.{{Cite dragon/269/The New Adventures of Volo: Hin Nobody Knows|87}}

The simplest form of sewer system consisted of various drains and grates&mdash;located in streets, alleyways, and some homes&mdash;that emptied directly into an underground river or cistern. The next step up from that were sewers consisting of stone halls, large enough to allow for maintenance, featuring [[clay]] or metal pipes. These could become rather mazelike and confusing to navigate.

==Functionality==
Cities that stood close to rivers or tidal bodies of water often chose to design their sewers to operate on a tidal flushing system. This meant they utilized their nearby source of moving water, diverting it so as to flush local wastes away to elsewhere.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Lord of the Sewers}} This was often the cheapest & easiest route for such cities to take, but it could cause problems for those downstream from them.

In order to prevent severe clogs, many sewer systems installed screens across their channels to "catch" large debris, which would then be cleared and have their debris taken to the surface by city workers. Sometimes these screens had spikes jutting out, which served to both catch more debris and dissuade those illicitly traversing sewers from getting up close to the screens and tampering with them, such as with things like [[acid]] or [[file]]s.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-07-27 - Sewer Screens}}

When such screens were installed throughout much of a sewer, they had the effect&mdash;from the point of view of those who regularly traversed sewers&mdash;of dividing it into segments.  With city crews working on particular segments and criminals finding them to be frustrating barriers to what would otherwise be an ideal covert highway.
===Bathrooms===
In most cities in the Realms, buildings had indoor toilet rooms that connected to the sewers. In the case of grand houses and castles, these toilets were known as garderobes. In most other cases, toilets were known by the less formal name of "jakes." Outdoor toilets were known variously as gloryhouses, thunder thrones, and privies.<ref>

Those indoor rooms typically consisted of a toilet seat with a gravity drop pipe descending beneath it. Nearby would be a wiping cloth for users, to be washed for later use, as well as large [[jug]]s{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 17: A Place to Stay}} of water with which to wash and flush down waste.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-04-12 - Sanitation in the Realms}}<ref group="note" name="explanation">Comparing this to real world plumbing, a "turn-the-balun" connection means that if water ever rose up the pipe, it would activate a floater connected to the lid, which in turn would push the lid closed. Otherwise known as a "float valve," this innovation developed by [[Burlan Almaether]] made it so that if liquid levels in an enclosure ever reached a certain point, the flow of water would be shut off,<ref> thus protecting cellars from sewers backing up.

Typically, outdoor privies in the Realms did not connect to the sewers, but in certain cities a direct connection was oftentimes the case.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/Oozes and Privys}}

|AH! The smell of adventure, in the very heart of the city!
|[[Minsc]]}}
Sewers often had a strong stench within them,{{Cite dragon/326/Down the Drain|53}}<ref><ref>{{Cite document/Hillsfar/Clue Book|16-17}} making it difficult for many creatures to smell much of anything,

In areas where there was poor ventilation, pockets of [[methane]] gas were likely to form from the waste in sewers.

==Prevalence of Sewers in the Realms==

Some [[drow]] communities in the [[Underdark]] were known to have sewers, but these were never large or extensive and their waste always flowed directly to [[fungus]] beds, which in turn fed upon the sewage.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2011)/Drow Sewage}} The subterranean city of [[Skullport]] also sported an extensive system of sewers, originally constructed by the [[Netherese]] as part of the [[Sargauth Enclave]].<ref> Beyond [[Toril]] itself, sewers could be found on a number of worlds, including [[Eberron]] and [[Oerth]].{{Cite web/Steal This Hook/Under Siege}}

==History==
;General History
Over the course of Toril's history, sewer systems were developed for various settlements by [[dwarves]], [[halfling]]s, and in rarer cases enterprising [[human]]s and [[elves]]. But over the course of centuries it was [[rock gnome]]s, more than any other race, who became specialized in designing, repairing, and perfecting the sewer systems of large mixed-population cities. Though the average human citizen was likely unaware of the gnomish oversight involved in their sewers.
;Specific History
The existence of sewers on Toril dated as far back as the city of [[Memnonnar]], which was established by the Great Pasha [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]] in approximately {{Yearlink|-6800}}.<ref group="note" name="Year">Dates are approximations based on the arrival and binding of [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]].

Centuries later, sewers were constructed in [[southeast Faer没n]] in the cities of [[Medinat Muskawoon]]<ref> and [[Phoenix (city)|Phoenix]]<ref> as well as in [[northwest Faer没n]] by the elven kingdom of [[Earlann]], within such cities as [[Ascalhorn]] and [[Myth Glaurach]],<ref> followed by the [[Netherese Empire]].<ref>

In the millennia since Memnonnar was founded, sewers continued to be constructed for cities within the [[Lands of Intrigue]],

During the time of the [[Shoon Imperium]], most of the cities in the Lands of Intrigue that were under its rule possessed sewers, including its capital [[Shoonach]]. When [[Strohm I]] led an assault on the city in the {{YearlinkName|449}}, he had many of his forces enter Shoonach through its sewers.

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}},<ref> a period known as the [[Silence of Lolth]] caused such an upset in [[drow]] society that many fled to either the [[Upperdark]] or [[Lowerdark]]. Those who fled to the latter depths displaced the [[rylkar]], a rat-like species known to only a few Underdark experts. Forced into moving to higher subterranean depths, the rylkar began infesting sewers across the [[Interior Faer没n|Interior]] and [[West Faer没n|Western]] reaches of Faer没n, being reported in such places as Waterdeep and the kingdom of [[Cormyr]]. Posing a significant threat, adventurers across the land banded together to eradicate the infections. However, the rylkar proved to be quite adaptable, continuing to seemingly build colonies just as few as they were destroyed.

Much of the wildlife in cities were relegated to sewers, wherein they were likely to become exposed to various illnesses<ref> and sometimes become transmitters of them. The creatures that were most often found to be lairing within sewers on Toril included [[chuul]]s,{{cite web | author=Logan, Bonner | title=Monster Manual Update: Chuul | publisher=Wizards of the Coast | date=2011-07-26 | work= Monster Manual Updates | url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/files/MMUpdate_Chuul.pdf | accessdate=2013-10-11}} the [[extaminaar]]s,<ref> [[meazel]]s,<ref> [[giant crocodile]]s, various varieties of [[ooze]]s, most notably [[cesspit ooze]]s,<ref> rylkars,In the [[Baldur's Gate series]] of games, one of the interactions that can occur between companions [[Edwin]] and [[Minsc]] is the former asking derisively what species of rodent [[Boo]] is, naming such possibilities as wharf rats, [[vole]]s, and "Perhaps the sewer-dwelling city weasel?" It's uncertain whether this last line is meant to be taken as a joke or a factual statement that weasels can be found in the sewers of the Sword Coast. But most of all [[rat]]s and [[giant rat]]s.
[[File:Giant crocodile 3e.png|thumb|300px|''...just waiting to strike!'']]
The sewers of some of Faer没n's most ancient cities, such as that of Skuld, were haunted by [[ephemeral swarm]]s. And in addition to animals and monsters, the moist, dark environment of sewers made them an excellent space for [[fungi]] to grow.

When it came to the [[humanoid]]s that inhabited cities, the destitute and criminal elements of society were likely to hide in the sewers, hide the bodies of their victims, or make a home for themselves. [[Beggar]]s often knew how to navigate sewers.<ref> And criminal elements such as outlaws,<ref> smugglers, [[thieves]], and outcasts often hid within sewers of the cities. In some cases even building their own societies. Sewers were also popular hiding spots for cults to outlawed [[deities]], such as [[Moander]].
