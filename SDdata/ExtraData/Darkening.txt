The Darkening was the name given to a spell that cast shadows over the Silver Marches in preparation for the drow and orc invasion of that land starting in 1484 DR, which came to be known as the War of the Silver Marches.
The Darkening caused dark roiling clouds of a foul, smoke-like substance to cover the sky above the Silver Marches. During the day, this hid the sun, reducing daylight to the equivalent of a moonless night. At night, the stars were hidden completely.
The spell was given to the drow wizard Tsabrak Xorlarrin by the illithid Methil El-Viddenvelp by the order of Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre. While casting the spell, Tsabrak was said to have served as a conduit of Lolth, On Midsummer night of the , Gromph Baenre, in an act of rebellion against Lolth and his sister Quenthel, counterspelled the Darkening, making it appear as if Drizzt DoUrden was channelling the power of his goddess Mielikki to do so.
