'''The Darkening''' was the name given to a spell that cast shadows over the [[Silver Marches]] in preparation for the [[drow]] and [[orc]] invasion of that land starting in [[1484 DR]], which came to be known as the [[War of the Silver Marches]].

==Effects==
The Darkening caused dark roiling clouds of a foul, smoke-like substance to cover the sky above the Silver Marches. During the day, this hid the [[sun]], reducing daylight to the equivalent of a [[moon]]less night. At night, the stars were hidden completely.

==History==
The spell was given to the [[drow]] [[wizard]] [[Tsabrak Xorlarrin]] by the [[illithid]] [[Methil El-Viddenvelp]] by the order of [[Matron Mother]] [[Quenthel Baenre]]. While casting the spell, Tsabrak was said to have served as a conduit of [[Lolth]], On [[Midsummer]] night of the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, [[Gromph Baenre]], in an act of rebellion against Lolth and his sister Quenthel, [[counterspell]]ed the Darkening, making it appear as if [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] was channelling the power of his goddess [[Mielikki]] to do so.<ref>
