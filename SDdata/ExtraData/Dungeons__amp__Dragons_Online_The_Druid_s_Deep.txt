''The Druid's Deep'' takes place at the same time as the events of ''[[Menace of the Underdark]]'', and shortly after the events of the ''Shadow Over Wheloon'' section of ''[[Shadowfell Conspiracy]]''. Like ''[[The High Road of Shadows]]'', it follows a plot tied to [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]]'s flight from [[Wheloon Prison]] with the ''[[Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll]]'', and deals with the repercussions of his seemingly insignificant act of passing on [[Halsaime's staff|a magical staff]] he found to his friend [[Halsaime]]. The [[priest]] [[Anazar Narroun]] serves as the central questgiver for the adventure as he directs the player to investigate each issue as they emerge.

'''Outbreak''' is introduced by the priestess [[Meena Follakin]], who sends the player to the [[Eveningstar War Hospital]] to address a bizarre plague afflicting it. With the ongoing war against the [[drow]], the [[Purple Dragons]] and [[War Wizards]] are unable to get involved, and so it falls to whoever volunteers to help. It is revealed that the [[ranger]] [[Peron Uthe]] carried a strange disease from the druids of [[Thorngap]], and has caused many patients to become [[red musk zombie]]s. The head priest [[Hurim Jaskyr]] uses samples from the recently-converted zombies [[Mikhael Jarvin]] and [[Aeron Leifbrand]] to create an inoculation against the plague, and Peron Uthe is destroyed before this zombie plague can escape the hospital.

'''Overgrowth''' follows on with [[Eolynn Arva]], who reports spotting strange plant growth emerging from [[Uthe Lodge|Peron's home]]. The investigation reveals that the building is filled with unnatural plant growth and corrupted, murderous creatures, led by the [[dryad]] [[Sylvie]]. Meeting the [[Harper]] [[Jussko Kwahn]], they team up to take the dryad out before she can threaten the whole town.

'''Thorn and Paw''' has the player working with the [[Harper]] [[Kirinel Zay]] to track down the origin of this strange plant corruption. She sends them with [[Garstrom Toom]] to find [[Thorn Hollow]], where Halsaime lives, only to find the druid circle filled with more hostile plants, frenzied animals, and mad druids. They find the friendly druid [[Carm Woodrusk]], who reveals that Halsaime is responsible for the nightmare, and gives a cryptic hint as to where to find him before dying of her injuries.

'''The Druid's Curse''' is directed by the Harper [[Tarim Inavule]], who sends the player on a final strike to the [[Druid's Deep]] where Halsaime has hidden. Fighting through his last defenders, Halsaime is caught and killed, with Jussko Kwahm destroying the powerful cursed staff that drove him mad in the first place. Pleased with saving the day, Tarim promises to immortalize the player's victory in a new song, ''[[The Song of Druid's Deep]]''.
