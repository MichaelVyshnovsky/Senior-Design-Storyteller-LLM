A '''greenhouse''', '''hothouse''', '''glasshouse''' or '''conservatory''' was a building with extensive windows to let sunlight in, and a structure to trap heat inside, typically used to grow plants that were too sensitive to cold or outside conditions. They were called '''underglass''' in the Realms.{{cite book/Ed Greenwood Presents Elminster's Forgotten Realms|166}}

==In the Realms==
Worshipers of [[Silvanus]] sometimes maintained underglass conservatories to manage demand for plants otherwise found only on the wild.{{cite book/Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|15}}{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Player's Guide|155}}
