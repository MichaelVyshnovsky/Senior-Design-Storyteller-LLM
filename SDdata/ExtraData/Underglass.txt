A greenhouse, hothouse, glasshouse or conservatory was a building with extensive windows to let sunlight in, and a structure to trap heat inside, typically used to grow plants that were too sensitive to cold or outside conditions. They were called underglass in the Realms.
Worshipers of Silvanus sometimes maintained underglass conservatories to manage demand for plants otherwise found only on the wild.
Some wizards used their laboratories as hothouses from time to time. Savants who worked with flora sometimes made use of greenhouses. The sage Quillan in particular was considering building a greenhouse around .
The city of Furthinghome in the Unapproachable East was famous for its glasshouses. Neverwinter used many hothouses to grow flowers all-year-round. Corellons Crown in Waterdeep was a glasshouse in the late 15 century DR. The selkie Ivain, a priestess of Lathander, had also created a glasshouse of her own near Waterdeep in the mid-14 century DR, though the frost giant Snorri destroyed it. Wolfhill House, built by Hezekiel Wolf around the mid-11 century DR, also had a conservatory. The necromancer Fairfern had a greenhouse in Tsurlagol.
The Dome of the Moon was a very peculiar glasshouse, which kept its plants at about 60ÂºF.
Alusair Obarskyr was once described as a "hothouse flower".
