'''''Mind over body''''' was a minor [[psionic]] devotion

==Effects==
In exchange for one hour of meditation per day, ''mind over body'' enabled a psion to either suppress or mentally satisfy their body's basic physical needs: food, water, and sleep. While the power was active, those affected would not feel hunger, thirst, or exhaustion.

Additionally, a psion could suppress the basic needs of others. This required the psion to meditate another hour for each person they wished to impose the effect upon and for each person to be in physical contact with the psion for the whole duration of the meditation. This physical contact was usually achieved through joining hands together, forming a continuous chain or circle of people.

At the minimum, ''mind over body'' could suppress basic needs for a period of five days, though experienced psions were capable of extending the period of effect much further. Upon the power reaching the end of its duration, the psion and anyone else that was under the effects of ''mind over body'' would collapse in exhaustion and require a day of rest for every two days the effect was active for, with two days of rest at the least. Alternatively, all those that were under the power's effect could be fully restored to normal by undergoing 24 hours of the psionic devotion ''[[complete healing]]''.
