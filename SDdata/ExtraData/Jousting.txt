'''Jousting''' was a type of mounted combat sport in the Realms whose tournaments were accompanied by a great deal of traditions and pageantry.

A traditional jousting match consisted of two competitors, nobles, and sometimes individuals competing on behalf of a noble, though by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] that practice had fallen out of fashion in some areas.

Jousting matches were split into "bouts" or "tilts", during which competitors would charge at each other full-tilt with [[lance]]s, then continue past the opponent down to their end of the rail. Many believed jousting simply involved repeating this process until either one of the competitors yielded or were unseated from their saddle by the force and momentum of the opposing lance. However, there was a wide variety of terminology, strategy, and scoring involved with the sport.

Traditionally, a match was won once a competitor earned three points—unseating an opponent provided exactly this amount, thus why many boiled the sport down to this being the objective. Additionally, two points could be earned by striking an opponent's [[helmet]] and a single point could be earned by breaking the opposing lance. If a lance was lost, some jousts had competitors switch to a blunted [[longsword]]. If a tie were to occur, competitors would continue jousting until one of them had surpassed the other in points.

Within the jousting scene it was common to refer to strikes by which area of an opponent’s shield they were aimed towards. Striking towards Pale Chief, Pale Fess, or the opponent's helm were considered aggressive strikes that limited posture and seating position, leaving one vulnerable to strikes. All other strikes were considered defensive and allowed for changing one's posture with ease.

===Equipment===
Equipment included [[Lance#Varieties_of_Lances|jousting lances]], which were lances specially designed to lessen injuries, Individual knights were often identified by colorful patterned dress, heraldry, or banners, as well as matching [[caparison]]s for their mount.

Alternatively, if a jousting lance was too expensive for a rider to acquire they might opt for a '''lance cup''', which were blunted caps of wood fitted over lances to make them suitable for tournament use. However, lance cups were notoriously undependable, having a chance to detach and fall off the lance they were on. Whenever this occurred a joust's officials would interrupt, having contestants start over, and if this were to repeatedly occur it could garner the risk of disqualification.<ref>

==History==
Jousting had a long history in the Realms, being considered an ancient tradition in Cormyr, among other places. The sport initially began as a sort of contest by which knights could prove their prowess to either their peers or their king. Over time the sport became more formal and the right to hold a tournament was seen as a sign of influence. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the sport was quite popularly viewed as a means by which people could garner for themselves fame, influence, or even power.
