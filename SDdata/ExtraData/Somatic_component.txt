[[File:Somatic component.jpg|thumb|280px|''Some simple hand motions used in the casting of a [[spell]].'']]
The '''somatic component''' was a basic part of spellcasting.

Many spells required the caster to make a motion to cast the spell. If the caster was unable to make the correct motion, the spell could not be cast. [[Bard]]s and some other arcane classes could cast spells in light armor without this risk, because their somatic components were less elaborate.

Each [[spellcasting tradition]] had its own somatic components.{{cite book/Races of Faer√ªn|5}}
