        "mainbody": "A favored plant was a minor manifestation of a deity.\nDeities could show their powers through major manifestations and minor manifestations. The appearance of a plant fell into the latter category.\nSome deities had some kind of plant as their favored plant. Some deities were specific in the coloration of their favored plants. For example, Ghaunadaur had only mauve (a kind of purple) roses as his favored plants.\nReal or illusory specimens of these plants were sent by deities to inform mortals of something. For example, the aforementioned Ghaunadaur sent his mauve roses to show that he was paying attention. These plants could be made to have their normal characteristics or some strange ones by the sending deity. In the aforementioned case of Ghaunadaurs mauve roses, the roses dripped blood.\nThe benefit of using plants as an omen was that it was easier for mortals to get used to plants than the more awesome or monstrous servants of a deity."
