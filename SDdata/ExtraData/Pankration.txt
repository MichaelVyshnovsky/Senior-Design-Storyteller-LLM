Pankration was a form of competitive wrestling and martial combat practiced in the country of Chessenta within the Old Empires region of east Faer√ªn.
This brutal sport involved direct competition between two participants. A victor was declared only when one of the combatants was knocked unconscious. Matches were observed by priests that healed all physical harm sustained during a bout. The only illegal moves were biting, eye-gouging, and breaking fingers. Pankration tournaments involved bouts of winners facing winners until only one participant was left standing.
