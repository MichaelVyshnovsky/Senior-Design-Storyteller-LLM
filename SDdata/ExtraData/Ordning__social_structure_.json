It was similar to a class-based society, but was much more specific, assigning a social rank to each individual. Therefore, each individual giant knew which other giants were inferior and superior to himself, and no giants were equal to other giants.\nEach type of giant used a different combination of skills or qualities to determine the ordning. In all cases, advancement was made by challenging a superior, but different types of giants used different systems and restrictions upon advancement. It was considered an evil (maug) act to show disrespect to a superior giant. This could be mocking, betrayal, disobedience, or a number of other behaviors.\nThe ordning applied to individual tribes, but it was an insult to treat a higher-ranked giant from another tribe as an inferior. Between different types of giant, there was a totally separate system, and even the lowest ranked giant of one type was superior to the highest ranked giant of an inferior type, but importantly, it was not considered evil to betray a giant of another type, merely rude.\nthumb|right|450px|In the hierarchy of giant-kind, those of lesser rank were obligated to offer deference to their superiors. Storm giants were among the those at the top of the ordning.\nThe types of giants were ranked as follows, in descending order \n* Titans\n* Storm giants\n* Cloud giants\n* Fog giants\n* Fire giants\n* Frost giants\n* Stone giants\n* Mountain giants\n* Hill giants\n* Ettins\n* Giant-kin \n* Ogres\nAround the , the Cult of the Dragon and their chromatic dragon cohorts plotted and schemed to loose Tiamat upon the world of Toril.\nAs events played out, the \"small folk\" wound up defeating the cult and stopping their plans, rather than the giants of the world. Annam saw this as complacency in his children. Annam broke the ordning, thereby allowing giants to create their own social structures and see who would come out on top.\nCategorySocietal terms\n3dhbbdlgghjpgzwbqs17uqvzezg8rmy"
