In all cases, advancement was made by challenging a superior, but different types of giants used different systems and restrictions upon advancement. It was considered an evil (maug) act to show disrespect to a superior giant. This could be mocking, betrayal, disobedience, or a number of other behaviors.",

        "History": "Around the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and their [[chromatic dragon]] cohorts plotted and schemed to loose [[Tiamat]] upon the world of [[Toril]].\n\nAs events played out, the \"small folk\" wound up defeating the cult and stopping their plans, rather than the giants of the world. Annam saw this as complacency in his children. Annam broke the ordning, thereby allowing giants to create their own social structures and see who would come out on top.",
