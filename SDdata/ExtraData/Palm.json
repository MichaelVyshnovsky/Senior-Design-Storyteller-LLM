        "Varieties": {
            "Banana": "The [[banana]] palm was a variety of palm tree that grew a fruit of the same name. They typically grew in tropical regions such as the island chain [[Steaming Isles]].",
            "Beetle": "The beetle palm was a variety of palm tree that could be found growing in the [[midwood]] area of the forest of [[Cormanthor]]. They could grow to be over {{SI|100|ft}} tall, but averaged about {{SI|70|ft}} and took their name from their smooth, black bark, which resembled a [[beetle]]'s shell. The wood was oily and burned easily, with less smoke than other woods. When freshly cut, the wood was a lackluster brown that lightened to a warm tan as it dried. Beetle palm wood was strong but became brittle as it aged and had a tendency to break under stress into segments from {{SIrange|2|3|ft|long=yes}} long so it was not usually chosen as a construction material.\n\nThe fronds of the beetle palm grew in clusters and were thin, jagged, and sometimes mistaken for branches instead of leaves. Once a year the tree produced about a dozen [[plum]]-sized nuts that grew at the base of the fronds. They had a soft outer flesh that covered a smooth, black nut that had a bitter taste. The nuts usually dropped to the forest floor after the first snow of winter. The wood of the beetle palm had no magical properties, but the nuts were an exceptionally good substitute for the material component of the ''[[goodberry]]'' spell.",
            "Coconut": "The [[coconut]] palm was a variety of palm tree that grew a hard-shell fruit of the same name. [[Mad Monkey Island]], as well as the island chains [[Jazayir al-Sartan]], [[Nada al-Hazan]], and the Steaming Isles. Occasionally they grew in desert regions, such as the [[Raurin|Desert of Desolation]] and the orchards of the fortress [[Sarahin]].\n\nIn [[Zakhara]], some were known to harvest the wood of its trunk for use in ships.",
            "Date": "The [[dates|date]] palm was a variety of palm tree that grew a fruit of the same name. Others were known to grow in desert regions, such as [[Calimshan]], the orchards of the fortress Sarahin,{{cite book/Assassin Mountain/Holy Slayer Sourcebook|28}} the [[Oasis of the Golden Falcon]], and oases in [[Anauroch]].",
            "Grenade": "The grenade palm was a variety of palm tree that grew only in the [[Raurin|Desert of Desolation]], around the [[Tomb of Martek]] and [[Pyramid of Amun-Re]]. They typically grew to around {{SI|33|ft}} tall and produced a fruit that bore a resemblance to [[pineapple]]s.\n\nThese fruits were highly volatile and would unleash a violent explosion upon hitting the ground. Even falling  while carrying the fruit, or bumping into it, was likely to cause an explosion. The grenade palm was believed to have evolved this trait as a means of dispersing its seeds at great distances. However, grenade palms were known to lose their explosive quality if removed from their native land, thus suggesting that the trait was [[magic]]al in nature.",
            "Mangrove": "The [[mangrove]] palm was a variety of palm tree that grew a fruit of the same name. They typically grew in swamps of tropical regions such as the Steaming Isles, and the island chain Nada al-Hazan.\n[[File:Sandling-MCVII.png|thumb|273px|''A [[sandling]] wanders the desert, with three palm trees in the distance.]]"
        },
        "Usages": "Some general uses of palm trees, regardless of what variety they were, included the following:\n* In the land of [[Chult]], some people were known to use palm trees as a construction material, while some [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]] were known to construct small crude shields out of the leaves of palm trees. Chultans were also known to harvest a sort of wax from the leaves of their region's palm trees.\n* In northern [[Malatra]] and the [[Kuong Kingdom]], palm tree leaves were typically used when constructing village huts. \n* In tropical regions, [[barbarian]]s and fishermen were occasionally known to craft narrow rafts from strips of palm tree wood. These rafts would utilize a half-dozen palm leaves as sails to ride the wind currents.",
