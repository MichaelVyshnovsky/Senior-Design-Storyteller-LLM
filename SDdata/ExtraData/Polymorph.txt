'''Polymorphing''' was a magical effect in which the subject creature assumed a new physical form while retaining its essential identity and abilities. These effects included the [[Alter self]] spell, polymorph spells ([[Polymorph (spell)|''polymorph'']], ''[[baleful polymorph]]'', and ''[[polymorph any object]]''), the ''[[shapechange]]'' spell, the ''[[wild shape]]'' [[druid]]ic ability, and the alternate form special quality. Magic could cause creatures and characters to change their shapes&mdash;sometimes against their will but usually to gain an advantage. Polymorphed creatures retained their own minds but had new physical forms.

The ''polymorph'' spell defined the general polymorph effect.
