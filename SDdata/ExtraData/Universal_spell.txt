Universal spells were spells not associated with any school, though they were sometimes collectively called the school of universal magic. Only a small number of spells fit this description, including permanency, prestidigitation, and wish. They could be learned by all wizards, no matter their specialization.
Universal spells were distinct from the much larger number of spells belonging to the universal province in the Zakharan system of dividing spells into elemental provinces rather than the eight commonly recognized schools.
