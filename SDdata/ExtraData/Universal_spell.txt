'''Universal spells''' were spells not associated with any school, though they were sometimes collectively called the '''school of universal magic'''. Only a small number of spells fit this description, including ''[[permanency]]'', ''[[prestidigitation]]'', and ''[[wish]]''. They could be learned by all wizards, no matter their specialization.

==Universal province==
Universal spells were distinct from the much larger number of spells belonging to the [[universal province]] in the [[Zakhara]]n system of dividing spells into elemental provinces rather than the eight commonly recognized schools.
