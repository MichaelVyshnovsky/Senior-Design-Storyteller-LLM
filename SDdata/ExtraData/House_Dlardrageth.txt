'''House Dlardrageth''' was originally a [[sun elf]] house of [[Cormanthor]] and a proud and powerful family in ancient [[Arcorar]] until they chose to give themselves to [[demon]]s, courting incubi and succubi, in an attempt to strengthen their line to gain the power necessary to seize the throne and rebuild the ruin of [[Aryvandaar]]. They were discovered by the [[Coronal]] and their house was destroyed, most of the members being imprisoned magically inside Arcorar's keep,
Their numbers, amongst others, constitute the [[daemonfey]]. The Dlardrageth tower near [[Myth Drannor]] has long since been abandoned.

==History==

Over hundreds of years, the house was responsible for the corruption and poisoning of the houses of [[House Reithel|Reithel]], [[House Yesve|Yesve]] and others of [[Siluvanede]] and the last mention of the house was in relation to the [[Seven Citadels' War]], which the house provoked, but they were found out soon after, being imprisoned beneath [[Ascalhorn]].

In 1369 DR the Harpers destroyed Hellkeep Gate and surviving daemonfey of House Dlardrageth were freed after millennia of imprisonment <ref>[[Brian R. James]], [[Ed Greenwood]] (September 2007).
