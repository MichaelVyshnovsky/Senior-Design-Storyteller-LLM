A '''beast''' was any creature that behaved in a manner similar to that expected of common [[animal]]s dwelling in the [[Prime Material Plane]]. However, while animals were generally beasts, many beasts were not animals and could have highly abnormal origins or features.

Physically, beasts tended to resemble animals or at the very least, other natural wildlife.
