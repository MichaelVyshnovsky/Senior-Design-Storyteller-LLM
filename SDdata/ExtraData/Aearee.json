        "History": {
            "Legacy": "Many thousands of years later, Captain [[Eartharran Neirdre]] of [[Evermeet]] sought a lost city of the creator races and discovered a floating city off the northern coast of Anchorome. It contained statues of the inhabitants, and Eartharran named the race \"aearee\". However, dragons assaulted and destroyed Eartharran's flying ship, which crashed on an island north of where [[Fort Flame]] later stood.\n\nIn the mid–14th century DR, the question of whether dragons or some avian race were one of the creator races was a long-running debate among scholars. Loremaster [[Ignace Dethingeller]] discovered the remains of Eartharran's ship and journal, and communicating his discovery of the aearee city to First Reader [[Tethtoril]] of [[Candlekeep]] in the late 14th century.\n\nThe aearee created or were the ancestors of the following races and creatures:\n* [[Wyvern]]<nowiki/>s\n* [[Aarakocra]]\n* [[Kenku]]\n* [[Owlbear]]<ref group=\"note\">Given the owl part of the owlbear, it stands to reason that the avian creator race was responsible, as all known creations of the creator races have shared biological characteristics.\n* Other unnamed avian races"

        "Nations": "The three Aearee Empires established their capitals in the following locales:\n* [[Aearee-Krocaa]]: The grand aerie of [[Viakoo]] on [[Mount Havraquoar]]\n* [[Aearee-Syran]]: The aerie of [[Phwiukree]] in the [[Star Mounts]]\n* [[Aearee-Quor]]: The rookery of [[Shara]] in the [[Orsraun Mountains]]",
        "Description": "According to Captain Eartharran Neirdre's sketches of statues found in a reputedly aearee city, the aearee were a humanoid race with both avian and draconic features, including both feathers and scales. Eartharran wondered if they were descendants of dragons who'd evolved bird-like features, or an ancestor of both avian and draconic creatures."
