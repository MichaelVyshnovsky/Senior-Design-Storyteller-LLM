__NOTOC__
The '''Travelers sphere''' was a group of spells granted to [[shaman]]s. These spells eased the burdens of traveling and helped promote safety.

==Spells==
As they advanced, the spellcaster learned spells that aided in navigation, such as ''[[know direction]]'' and ''[[helping hand]]'', and made travel easier, like ''[[aura of comfort]]'', ''[[lighten load]]'', and ''[[easy march]]''. ''[[Know customs]]'' let them understand the areas they passed through. They also acquired spells that assisted in camping, such as ''[[create campsite|create campsite/break camp]]'' and ''[[circle of privacy]]''. They could also gain mounts with ''[[tree steed]]'' and ''[[monster mount]]''. Finally, they could create their own trails with ''[[clear path|clear/clutter path]]'' and ''[[hovering road]]''.
