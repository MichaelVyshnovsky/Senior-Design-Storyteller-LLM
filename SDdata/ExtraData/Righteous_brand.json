When cast, ''righteous brand'' lights a cleric's weapon with the [[holy symbol]] of their [[deity]], allowing the cleric to channel [[divine magic|divine power]] through it. When a cleric strikes a foe with a weapon so enchanted they momentarily brand their enemy with the symbol and the release of divine magic allows them to enhance the martial skill of an ally within twenty-five feet to a degree dependent on the cleric's physical strength. Like most prayers of its power level, ''righteous brand'' increases in strength as the cleric's experience grows. ''Righteous brand'' is easily cast and can be reused instantaneously.",
