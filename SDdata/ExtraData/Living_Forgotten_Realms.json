        "mainbody": "'''Living Forgotten Realms''' (LFR) was an organized play program run by the [[Role-Playing Group Association]] (RPGA) for the 4{{th}} edition of [[Dungeons & Dragons]]. The program was officially sanctioned by [[Wizards of the Coast]] from its premiere in August 2008 up until fall 2010. Despite a lack of official support and funding beyond that point, LFR continued to release unofficial adventures until 2014. This wiki only covers the officially sanctioned adventures.",
        "Gameplay": "The Living Forgotten Realms was a massive coordinated campaign comprising dozens of adventures, intended as a \"living world\" experience shared by all participating players. The individual adventures were authored by fans, then purchased, edited, and published online by Wizards of the Coast.\n\nFor administrative purposes, the Living Forgotten Realms divided players into twelve in-universe regions by way of real-world regions. For example, players in the southeastern United States were assigned to the Aglarond region. These individual regions all had their own series of adventures. Several region-agnostic adventure series were also released under the names \"Core\", \"Special\", \"Quest\", and so on.",
