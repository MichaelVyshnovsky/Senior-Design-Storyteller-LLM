        "mainbody": "he Living Forgotten Realms (LFR) was an organized play program run by the Role-Playing Group Association (RPGA) for the 4 edition of Dungeons & Dragons. The program was officially sanctioned by Wizards of the Coast from its premiere in August 2008 up until fall 2010. Despite a lack of official support and funding beyond that point, LFR continued to release unofficial adventures until 2014. This wiki only covers the officially sanctioned adventures.\nThe Living Forgotten Realms was a massive coordinated campaign comprising dozens of adventures, intended as a \"living world\" experience shared by all participating players. The individual adventures were authored by fans, then purchased, edited, and published online by Wizards of the Coast.\nFor administrative purposes, the Living Forgotten Realms divided players into twelve in-universe regions by way of real-world regions. For example, players in the southeastern United States were assigned to the Aglarond region. These individual regions all had their own series of adventures. Several region-agnostic adventure series were also released under the names \"Core\", \"Special\", \"Quest\", and so on.\nAdventures set outside the twelve regions, with some exceptions.\nAdventures taking place within the twelve regions.\nAdventures that required at least four of the players to be part of the same Adventuring Company, a real-life organization tied to one of the twelve regions.\nConnected adventures intended to be played in sequential order.\nAdventures intended to preview the Living Forgotten Realms campaign and 4 edition Dungeons & Dragons in general.\nAdventures intended for characters that unlocked a series of hidden goals in other Living Forgotten Realms adventures.\nMore challenging adventures that offered greater rewards for players who could finish them in time.\nSpecial event adventures.\nCategoryLiving Forgotten Realms\nCategoryRPGA campaigns\nek255zs8ztw8oxhv2ku5qxgsq58gox6"
