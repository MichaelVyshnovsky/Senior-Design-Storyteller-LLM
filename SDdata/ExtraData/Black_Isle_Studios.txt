Black Isle Studios was a division of the PC and video game developer and publisher Interplay Entertainment, created specifically for the development of PC role-playing games. The division was formed during 1996, adopting the name "Black Isle Studios" during 1998. The idea for the divisions name came from the Black Isle in Scotland - founder Feargus Urquharts native country. Black Isle Studios was most famous for working on the Fallout, Icewind Dale and Baldurs Gate series of PC role-playing games, though it only published the Baldurs Gate series.
In 1998, several key members responsible for the divisions first title, Fallout, left Interplay to form Troika Games. On December 8, 2003, in the midst of serious financial difficulties, Interplay laid off the entire Black Isle Studios staff., filing bankruptcy on June 2, 2004. By then, most members had moved on to found Obsidian Entertainment.
Until last, Black Isle Studios worked on new innovative games, such as Fallout 3 (Codename Van Buren) and Black Isles Torn.
