True dragons went through twelve stages of growth during their enormously long life cycle. While size depended on the subspecies of dragon, great wyrms were often more than  in length. Unlike humans, age did not seem to diminish their strength, intelligence, or power, and often had the opposite effect, and so the oldest wyrms were among the most formidable and impressive creatures in all of Faerûn.
