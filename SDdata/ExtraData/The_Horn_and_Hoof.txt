'''The Horn and Hoof''' is a noisy tavern in [[Longsaddle]], with a great assortment of drinks served at incredibly high prices. It is run by an retired warrior named [[Malavos Drunn]], who keeps order with the threat of force. Violence is still common however, with the dead or beaten bodies simply being tossed outside. The reason the tavern has survived for as long as it has is most likely due to its lack of competition.
