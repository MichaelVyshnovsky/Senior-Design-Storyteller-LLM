==Description==
The [[Wizards of the Coast]] provided the following introduction to Elemental Evil: 
{{Quote|''Four apocalyptic cults of Elemental Evil are building secret sanctuaries and outposts throughout [[the North]], bringing terror and destruction to the [[Forgotten Realms]]. Each cult is devoted to one of the [[Princes of Elemental Evil]] (godlike entities embodying air, earth, fire, and water) and is led by a nihilistic prophet, corrupted by power. The cruel [[elf]] princess [[Aerisi Kalinoth]] speaks for the air [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]], while [[Marlos Urnrayle]], a fierce male [[medusa]], leads the [[Cult of the Black Earth]]. The [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] scars its followers at the behest of the beautiful and deadly [[tiefling]] [[Vanifer]], and the mutilated sailor [[Gar Shatterkeel]] plots to drown the world with his [[Cult of the Crushing Wave]].''

''The cults use ''[[devastation orb]]s'', forged of raw elemental power, to ravage [[Faerûn]] with horrifying earthquakes, typhoons, tornados, and other disasters. Independently, the cults are terrible adversaries, but now they have secretly begun transforming a long-lost dungeon into a huge subterranean temple dedicated to an alien entity known as the [[Elder Elemental Eye]]. To prevent this union of the Elemental Evils into one catastrophic force, heroes must expose the prophets' true agenda. The cults' agents are everywhere and their power is immense.''

''When you don’t know whom to trust, knowledge is your only weapon. Unearth the Deception.''|Wizards of the Coast}}
