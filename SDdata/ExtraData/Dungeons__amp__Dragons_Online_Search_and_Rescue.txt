'''''Search and Rescue''''' is a free-to-play stand-alone quest for ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Online]]'' where the player characters look for lost [[adventurer]]s in the [[Stonelands]]. The adventure was added to the game on June 1, 2016 as part of Update 31.

==Plot==
'''Search and Rescue''' has the player find [[Popkin Shortshanks]] in [[Eveningstar]], a [[gnome]] in desperate need of assistance. She was adventuring with her friends in the Stonelands, but they were overcome by foes and need immediate rescue. Thanks to some ''[[word of recall]]''-infused trinkets given by a "[[Elminster|nice old gent with a weird hat]]", it's possible to rescue her friends as soon as they are found. In the Stonelands, the entry to [[Netherese tomb (Stonelands)|the tomb]] is surrounded by typical inhabitants of the wilderness like [[scorpion]]s and [[harpies]], and the interior filled by the ancient [[undead]]. The [[mummy]] [[Laeron]] is roused and does battle, and a secret tunnel behind his throne shows the way to deeper caverns and the [[Underdark]] where Popkin's friends were trapped.

Fortunately, [[Jarus Brithandir|Jarus]], [[Helayna]], and [[Kirina Aelorothi|Kirina]] are merely isolated and hiding, though [[Liantor Stoneborn]] was slain and looted by [[Clan Daeronnax]] [[kobold]]s. At the end of the tunnels is the lair of the [[red dragon]] [[Daeronnax]], who has kept [[Tristran of Daggerford]] as a snack for later, and who can be rescued. Thus, all but one of Popkin's friends can be saved.

Down an optional branching route is a secret [[Drow outpost (Stonelands)|Drow outpost]] ruled by Mistress [[Laerion'vyr]], who has a particular interest in summoning [[slaad]]i for her forces, including [[Il'tharis the Terrible]].
