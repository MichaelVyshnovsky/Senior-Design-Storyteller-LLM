'''Paronder''' was a belief that [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] or some other entity or force of the [[multiverse]] promoted a law of cosmic balance, so that those who did something would be rewarded in the same way. For instance, if someone did something good, the cosmos would do something good for them, but if they did something evil, they would be repaid with evil, and so on.{{Cite dragon/427/The Sundering: To Rule Two Worlds|36}}

==Background==
According to [[Elminster Aumar]], the term was named for a [[human]] sage named [[Paronder]], who first promoted the belief that the practice of [[magic]] had its own tenets and principles, and that studying magical theory would be something useful to those who sought to wield and understand magic.{{Cite dragon/427/The Sundering: To Rule Two Worlds|38}}

==History==
One of the main practitioners of this philosophy was the [[archdevil]] [[Klaskornus]], although Elminster believed that his motives were far from selfless.{{Cite dragon/427/The Sundering: To Rule Two Worlds|37}}
