"'''Sammafar'''" was an official title in the Kingdom of [[Tethyr]]. A sammafar was the head manager of a noble's estate, ensuring the maintenance of the physical location and the direction of its personnel. While unable to command troops, sammafars often provided advice on matters of estate security.

A sammafar was the direct superior to those holding the titles of [[bailiff]] and [[farsann]].
