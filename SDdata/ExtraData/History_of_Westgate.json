        "Early History": "This area of the Dragon Coast was first settled by [[human]]s from the [[Vilhon Reach]] around {{Yearlink|-1000}}. They founded various settlements, of which Westgate grew to be the biggest.\n\nHowever, in time, the tyrannical [[topaz dragon]] [[Kisonraathiisar]] reigned over the fledgling town. Finally, in the {{YearlinkName|-349}}, Kisonraathiisar was slain by [[Saldrinar|Saldrinar of the Seven Spells]], a [[Netherese]] [[wizard]], who took over as the first human king of Westgate.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|-286}}, the vampire [[Orlak]] and a small army of mercenaries captured the city in a single night. Orlak proclaimed himself the Night King and ruled Westgate for over a hundred years.\n\nOrlak was defeated and overthrown by a group of [[Lathander]]-worshiping paladins in the {{YearlinkName|-137}}.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|257}}, pirates from the [[Pirate Isles]] invaded Westgate and began the 200-year-long reign of the Pirate Kings.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|429}} the [[Chondathan]] mercenary captain [[Mulsantir Illistine]] attacked Westgate and overthrew the pirate kings.",
        "Modern History": "The city of Westgate was lax laws towards visitors and in the {{YearlinkName|1182}}, these policies taken advantage of by the infamous Pirate King [[Immurk]] and his gang of buccaneers. The  Pirate King hatched a daring ploy to assemble a large contingent of his men in Westgate and attempt to steal the entirety of the city's naval fleet. Immurk's pirates were successful in taking over several vessels, but they promptly were sunk by a barrage of ''[[fireball]]s'' and ''[[smokepowder]]'' kegs fired at them by the remaining navy. The event later became known as [[The Rout of the Pirate King]].\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], the god [[Garagos]] manifested in Westgate and went on a rampage.{{Cite web enhancement/Westgate Timeline|11}}\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the [[Twelfth Ser√¥s War]] in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, which raged beneath the [[Inner Sea]], merchants all around the Inner Sea began trading more with their undersea neighbors. Relative to [[Starmantle]], however, Westgate was unable to profit from these new trading opportunities, owing to the proximity of [[koalinth]] tribes nearby their city.<ref name = \"WGTimeline-p11-12\">{{Cite web enhancement/Westgate Timeline|11-12}}\n\nStarmantle's advantage would prove short-lived, however, as the city was annihilated by the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, while Westgate escaped relatively unscathed.{{Cite dragon/428/Backdrop: Westgate|10}} It affected Westgate primarily in two ways. First, the shrinking level of the Inner Sea caused Westgate's docks to no longer abut the sea, and new construction was required. The second was that the effects on [[magic]] weakened [[Orbakh]] and his [[vampire]] allies, allowing a coalition of the [[Fire Knives]], foreign adventurers, noble families, and the [[Eye of Justice]] to drive the [[Night Court]] from Westgate in the {{YearlinkName|1387}}.{{Cite dragon/428/Backdrop: Westgate|12}}\n\nThroughout the 1390s, waves of [[Shou]] immigrants settled along the Dragon Coast and in Westgate in particular.<ref name = \"Dragon428-p12\"/> In the {{YearlinkName|1393}}, they formed the neighborhood of [[Tidetown]] in the new construction built near the lower level of the Inner Sea.<ref name = \"Dragon428-p12\"/> However, the Shou were brutally oppressed in Westgate for decades until, at long last, in the {{YearlinkName|1451}} a group of nine Shou heroes stood up against injustice. They were dubbed the [[Nine Golden Swords]] and they defended the Shou neighborhoods on the eastern end of Westgate. Their success drew the attention of the [[Shadowmasters]] of [[Telflamm]], who began funding the group, hoping to gain a foothold on the Dragon Coast. Over time, the heroic origins of the Nine Golden Swords gave way to corruption, with the group becoming yet another criminal gang of Westgate.<ref name = \"Dragon428-p12\"/>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1477}} tensions between the Fire Knives and the Nine Golden Swords reached a breaking point and gang warfare erupted across Westgate. The Fire Knives patron and Croamarkh [[Jaundamicar Bleth]] lost considerable power and influence during this conflict, including many family members being assassinated.<ref name = \"Dragon428-p12\"/>\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1487}}, the young and aggressive vampire [[Kirenkirsalai]] restored the [[Night Masks]] underneath the city and became a force to be reckoned with.<ref name = \"Dragon428-p12\"/>\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, Westgate remained a seedy metropolis, and a haven for the Fire Knives and other enemies of [[Cormyr]].<ref name = \"SCAG-p15\"> However, Queen [[Raedra]] of Cormyr declined to permanently add the cities annexed during their war with [[Netheril]] to Cormyr's empire domain<ref name = \"SCAG-p11\"> in hopes of reducing tensions between Cormyr and Westgate, as Westgate's greatest fear was an expansionist Cormyr. In particular, Westgate bristled at Cormyr's acquisition of cities on the Dragon Reach such as the city of [[Proskur]].<ref name = \"Dragon428-p6\">{{Cite dragon/428/Backdrop: Westgate|6}}"
