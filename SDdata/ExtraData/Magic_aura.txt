A '''magic aura''' or '''magical aura''' was a type of [[aura]], an invisible property that indicated the strength and nature of the [[magic]] possessed by a magical item or a [[spell]], and by certain mages.{{Cite comic/The Ostus Legacy|14, 17, 18}}

The ''[[detect magic]]'' spell allowed a spellcaster to examine magical auras in their vicinity.

Arcane spellcasters could also possess a magic aura, and this revealed their nature and make-up to other mages. Such auras could also be passed down through family lines. For example, the [[wizard]] [[Kyriani Agrivar]] bore the magic aura of her father, the renowned wizard [[Ostus Agrivar]]. This allowed Kyriani to control the [[Great Door]] that Ostus had created and only he and co-creator [[Parwyyd Hanifar]] could control. Parwyyd described Kyriani's magic aura as "odd", owing to her complex origin as a re-merger of the divided being [[Cybriana]] and [[Kilili]].{{Cite comic/Day of the Darkening|7-8, 10-11, 20-21}}
