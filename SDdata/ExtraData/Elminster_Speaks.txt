'''Elminster Speaks''' was a webseries of articles by [[Ed Greenwood]] published (roughly) twice a month from 04/04/2001&ndash;04/30/2003. The series featured articles about three cities in the [[Forgotten Realms]]: [[Voonlar]] (33 articles), [[Delzimmer]] (14 articles), and [[Khôltar]] (17 articles), plus a few about points in-between. The entire series may be downloaded as a [https://web.archive.org/web/20161101195653/http://archive.wizards.com/dnd/files/ES_ARCHIVE.zip 89-page PDF file], or the individual articles can still be viewed in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150920104802/http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/archfr/es Elminster Speaks archive].

|The [[Sage of Shadowdale]] has something to say about pretty much everything. Despite having pages in [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]], [[Dungeon magazine|Dungeon Adventures]], and [[Polyhedron Newszine]], the Old Mage still has more to speak of the Realms. Not wanting to anger an archmage, we decided it would be best to give him a weekly column from which to discuss the finer points.
