==History==
Around [[1375 DR]], [[Noralli|Mistress Norali]] had created an approximation of a carousel in the [[Undermountain]] community of [[Spiderhaven]]. But unlike the carousels of the Gondsmen, which were mechanical in nature, hers utilized relatively benign [[undead]] animals.<ref>

In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Father [[Otis Gregor]] of the temple [[Turning Wheel]] in [[Ravens Bluff]], believed that his clergy needed to take a more visible role in their community. To that end he had his clergy construct and maintain children's playgrounds in the parks of Ravens Bluff, which featured carousels.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/135/City Stories: The Temple of Gond|11}}

==Notable Users==
* The [[Jack Mooney & Sons Circus]] had a merry-go-round that was built by the [[gnome]] [[Tarontuttle]] and cost a [[copper piece]] to ride. It notably had a [[pipe organ]] in its center, whose valves were opened and closed by the ride's various cams and levers as its outer ring rotated. Rather than being self-propelled, it was provided motive power by a team of six [[horse]]s attached by spokes and harnesses. Its riding animals were wooden and painted, consisting of [[griffon]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[pegasi]], and [[dragon]]s. Each of these animals had its own system of wheels, cranks, and cams to make it go up and down as the outer ring platforms rotated. The dragons in particular moved their wings in beat with the pipe organ's music.
* Beyond the [[Prime Material]], the [[planes]]-faring [[Witchlight Carnival]] had a carousel. Its riding vehicles were [[magic]]al wooden unicorns that could speak.
