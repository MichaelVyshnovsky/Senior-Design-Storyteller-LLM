This was an enchanted bronze carving knife that belonged to the magic-user Valmous.
This carving knife could slice through stone as though it were mere flesh, though when used against flesh or metal it behaved as normal.
In the 12 century DR, Valmous used this to carve the Awtawmatawn out of a cliff-face near the College of Shaping Magics.
1358 DR, a group of adventurers hired by Amelior Amanitas to recover the scattered fragments of the Awtawmatawn were exploring the ruins of the College of Shaping Magics when they came across this carving knife still lodged within the cliff-face it was used to carve.
