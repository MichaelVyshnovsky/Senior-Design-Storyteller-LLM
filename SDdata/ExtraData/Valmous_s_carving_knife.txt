This was an [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[bronze]] carving [[knife]] that belonged to the [[magic-user]] [[Valmous]].

==Powers==
This carving knife could slice through stone as though it were mere flesh, though when used against flesh or metal it behaved as normal.

==History==
In the 12{{th}} century [[DR]], Valmous used this to carve the [[Awtawmatawn]] out of a cliff-face near the [[College of Shaping Magics]].

[[1358 DR]],{{ShatteredStatue-Time}} a group of [[adventurer]]s hired by [[Amelior Amanitas]] to recover the scattered fragments of the Awtawmatawn were exploring the ruins of the College of Shaping Magics when they came across this carving knife still lodged within the cliff-face it was used to carve.
