For centuries, their elder brains sought to bring back their dominion.|Ch'r'ai [[W'wargaz]].}}\n\nThe idea of the Grand Design was to rebuild the lost empire of the mind flayers. Mind flayers would work on accomplishing the Grand Design as soon as they had established their colonies.\n\nPart of the Grand Design involved enslaving (or eliminating) all [[gith (race)|gith]], as they once had, as well as other [[humanoid]]s. To achieve the Grand Design, illithids spent much time studying different phenomena and subjects, such as the culture of other creatures.\n\nIllithid colonies had different methods of contributing to the Grand Design. Some may have thought to rediscover the method of creating [[nautiloid]]s, whilst others may have thought to find and destroy the homes of the gith.",
