Imaskari artificers were the mages of the Raurin Empire, or Imaskar. They were known to be haughty, arrogant, and overwhelmingly powerful.
In the year , Emperor Umyatin of Imaskar gave himself the title of Lord Artificer all emperors would use the same title until the destruction of the Empire in .
The Imaskari were known to have an Artificers Guild. The guild was active in the facility underneath Maskana, where they studied the powers of unusual creatures. The symbol of the Guild consisted of a crescent and a fox.
The longest-lasting legacy of the Imaskari was their extensive use of extradimensional spaces and portals, which had transformed their cities design almost from the beginning of their empire. Throughout the Early Dynastic period, Imaskari Artificers created the Bukhara Spires, two-way portals which became the foundation of Imaskars military might by using them, they were capable of mobilizing entire armies in the blink of an eye.
By , the razing of the kobold city of Zexthandrim was carried out by a combined force of portal golems, which were slow and carried a large portal in their chest, and shepherd golems, which were smaller, faster, and capable of forcing the kobolds through these portals to parts unknown. Sonjars Tower, which belonged to an artificer who lived through the end of the Empire, had permanent portals to the Inner Planes for things as minor as pond water, ventilation, and even cooking fire. The ancient Fortress of the Old Man in Sentinelspire also had portals to elemental planes for heat and cooling, as well as an outer plane dominated by nature.
The artificers were aware not just of planes from the Great Wheel, but also some otherwise unknown planes, such as a Dimension of Silence and a Dimension of Darkness, both accessible from portals in the City of Solon. Under the orders of Lord Artificer Khotan, artificers of the Middle Kingdoms period kidnapped the ancestors of the Mulan not only from a different crystal sphere, but across different times, suggesting that the artificers were also capable of creating permanent portals across time. Imaskari wizards were also asiduous users of pacts with extraplanar creatures both Umyatin and Omanond were often represented as making compacts with demons or strange fey creatures devas reincarnated from the Mulhorandi as of  sought vengeance on the leShay of Sarifal for having aided in the construction of the portals used to abduct their ancestors.
Combining both aspects of their extraplanar crafts (portals across time, space, and extraplanar entities), the Elder Evil Pandorym was summoned to the Realms near the end of the Imaskar empire, probably under the orders of Lord Yuvaraj. It was said to hail from an entirely different cosmology, and it was capable not only of seeing across thousands of years, but make minute changes across the timeline.
Shortly after the plague known as the Silent Death in the late Middle Kingdoms period, The Imaskari had developed an intense scorn for the divine. The practice of torturing divine spellcasters, however, continued well up until the final collapse of the Empire, almost 2000 years later Sonjars Tower had rooms for that purpose.
An ancient arcane Imaskari text, "The Chants of Arcainasyr, as recorded by Macchius the Ebon Flame" held incantations that were worded as hateful littanies of foul destruction, prayers to nameless deities of malevolence. A copy available in the College of Mages of Cimbar circa  was also enciphered with a simple substitution cypher. Per Aeron Morieths judgement after reading the text, the Imaskari sorcerers had probably bound dark spirits in their own bodies for power that kind of sorcery was openly employed in the Empire.
Imaskari wizards were known to extend their lives through sorcery. Lord Artificer Omanond ruled for a minimum of 700 years between  and . Kujawa, another artificer and later Emperor of the successor state of Anok-Imaskar, ruled between  and . Hilather, another wizard, and then for more than a millenium as Halaster Blackcloak. The artificer Yaravindar Ipurnos had accomplished the same feat.
Imaskari artificers were the original creators of shadesteel golems. They were also rumored to have created many other creatures, such as locathah, morkoth, kuo-toa, and even the Scalamagdrion. Per some sources, the Imaskari had created the phaerimm, though the aberrations were known to have battled the Sarrukh as early as , tens of millenia before the Imaskari empire began. Rumours abounded of an imaskari scepter capable of summoning star spawnNote that at the time of publishing Dragons of Faerun, 2006, the Monster Manual with star spawn had not been published yet and would not be until 2009, in a different edition. A vestige featured in a web enhancement, Zceryll, was also referred to as the Star-Spawn. In the absence of later references to the same artifact, it remains somewhat ambiguous whether the scepter was meant to summon them. hidden somewhere in a ruin in Unther, which they created hoping to eventually summon aberrant forms of dragons the Cult of the Dragon and the faithful of Tiamat both sought this scepter. Sages from Unthalass theorized that the realm to which this scepter connected had creatures similar to aboleths and mind flayers.
The Imaskari were aware of earth nodes. Sonjars Tower was built inside an earth node to better take advantage of its powers Deep Imaskar was built in a cave sought specifically for the strength of its faerzress.
The portals in the Fortress of the Old Man were also believed to be capable of altering the behaviour of the volcano, Sentinelspire, beneath In Solon, an ancient temple bore portals to the planes of Ash, Vacuum, and Ice, where artifacts capable of triggering a volcanic eruption were hidden.
A small number of spells presumed to have been created by Netherese arcanists had actually been known by artificers for some time before. Excavations in Solon had chances to unearth scrolls of mass gaseous form, audible glamer and even continual light. Variant forms of mantle magic had been known since the time of the Imaskari.
