They were generally good, altruistic, and righteous creatures. Despite their relatively benign nature, metallic dragons were also aggressive when threatened or challenged.\nIt was believed by scholars from Candlekeep that all species of metallic dragons evolved from the proto-dragon species of the ferrodraco genus.\nAlthough there were many metallic dragon species, the following are the ones known by sages of Faer√ªn\nGold dragonsGold dragons were the most powerful and majestic of the classic metallic dragons. They are wise, lawful good foes of evil and injustice. Gold dragons were very knowledgeable and reclusive. They preferred stone lairs and had a cone of fire as a breath weapon.\nSilver dragons Silver dragons were regal, lawful good creatures who often took a humanoid form and lived among humans and elves. Their breath weapon was a cone of freezing cold, and they normally laired in mountains.
