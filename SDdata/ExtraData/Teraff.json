Her fears proved true when she and her group were captured by some of those coastal settlers.\n\nTeraff was tortured to death for not revealing the locations of the ''[[portal]]s'' to Sildëyuir or how to activate them but some of her group managed to escape capture and return home. They told of her tale and she was forever remembered as a heroine and a symbol of inspiration to the star elf people.",
