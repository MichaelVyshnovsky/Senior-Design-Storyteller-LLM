        "mainbody": "'''''Molecular rearrangement''''', or more properly '''''matter rearrangement''''',Despite the slightly different power, both molecular rearrangement in 1st or 2nd edition and matter rearrangement in 3rd edition are described using similar examples, with the text of both powers explaining a case where a number of coins is transmuted into others of greater value. Similarly, the latter power is a part of the psychokinesis discipline in 3e, unlike similar powers, which fall within metacreativity. Thus, this article is written under the assumption that the latter power is intended to be the same as the earlier. was a [[psionic]] science of the [[psychokinesis]] [[discipline]] that allowed the [[psionicist]] to transmute minute amounts of matter, altering their fundamental structure and properties.",
        "Effects": "A successful use of this science altered an ounce of matter every hour, performing an [[alchemy]]-like operation which transformed any material into almost any other nonliving material. By modifying the molecules of an object, ''molecular rearrangement'' could also be used to upgrade a weapon by psionic tempering, but this required knowledge on the psion's part on how its target was made in the first place. The amount of matter that could be affected was measured in ounces on either case; up to {{SI|1|ounce|long=yes}} was transmuted over an hour. The power could be used in combination with ''[[create object]]'', to create an object out of its raw materials just as they were refined.\n\nInitial accounts claimed there was a relationship between the refinement of the psionicist's psychic powers and the kinds of matter that could be converted, limiting the effects to transforming the molecules of metals; while the least manifesters were capable of transmuting [[lead]], [[gold]] and other soft materials, only those with some amount of progress could affect [[copper]], [[tin]], [[silver]], [[zinc]], and it took significant accomplishment to modify [[platinum]], [[nickel]], [[iron]], and similar. Even those at the top of their professions weren't guaranteed to transmute steel; the transmutation of [[mithril]] required a psionicist well beyond the level at which they were worth their name, and exotic materials such as [[adamantine]] could only be synthesized by psionicists nearing the apex of their power. These accounts also made a mention of the fact that the drain it put unto the psionicist prevented another use for a month.\n\nAccounts post-dating the [[Time of Troubles]] made no mention of such a relationship, explicitly mentioning from the start the conversion of coal into [[diamond]]s, metals to glass, wood to [[ruby]], or even neutralizing a [[poison]], none of which was necessarily metallic; however, these more complex transformations required four times longer. These accounts clarified that the power respected states of matter and could not create matter or mass from nothing, nor could it affect living creatures above {{SI|1|ounce|long=yes}}. Creatures under that mass limit were killed in the rearrangement of their molecules. In any case, several tries could be necessary for a psion who was not especially adept.{{cite dragon/78/Spells Can Be Psionic, Too|73-74}}\n\nAmongst other known limits, ''molecular rearrangement'' was known not to affect artifacts from the [[Nine Hells]],{{Cite dragon/76/The Nine Hells, Part II|44}} or divinely created material.{{Cite dragon/90/Plane Facts on Gladsheim|58}} Learning it, for most psionicists, required mastery of [[telekinesis (psionic)|telekinesis]] and [[molecular manipulation]].\n\nNotably, the power was not affected by the [[phase trap]] spell.{{Cite dragon/92/Pages from the Mages III|34}} Some alloys were proofed against ''molecular rearrangement''.{{Cite dungeon/19/House of Cards|49}}\n\nThe power was better known under the name of ''matter rearrangement'' in accounts post-dating the {{yearlinkName|1372}}. The more generic description was also more inaccurate, as it was only known to be used for the transmutation of metals into other metals; it, too, was best known for its ability to improve the worth of coins. This power also acted far faster, requiring at most six seconds for {{SI|0.1|pounds|long=yes}}, but was limited in effect to that much matter per manifestation; its toll upon the user was also such that it hindered the development of their lifeforce, and their ability to learn effectively from experience, proportionally to the monetary value of the materials generated.",
        "Notable Users": "An extremely rare ability, it was only known to be used by [[gem dragon]]s, in particular [[sapphire dragon]]s,{{cite book/Monstrous Manual|73}} and the even rarer [[beljuril dragon]]s.{{Cite dragon/265/Earthstokers|42}} According to early sources, only a few extraplanar beings such as [[couatl]] or [[shedu]] could employ it; the only other outsiders in possession of such power were immensely powerful ones such as [[Lolth]], or [[Sardior]].{{Cite dragon/37/That's not in the Monster Manual!|35}} [[Solar]]s were also likely to sport these capabilities.{{Cite dragon/64/Featured Creatures|11}}\n\nThe [[amethyst dragon]] [[Eldenser]] was known to bear the power of ''matter rearrangement''.{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Eldenser, \"The Worm Who Hides in Blades\"}}",
