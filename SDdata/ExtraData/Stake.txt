Stakes were a type of wooden or metal cylindrical post with a pointed end. They were similar to wooden pegs and metal spikes, but were generally much larger and more durable, being intended for outdoor use and rough conditions.

Stakes were typically made of either wood or some form of metal. They could even be made in the field by whittling down branches.
* Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold stakes made of high-impact steel in sets of eight at a cost of 30 gold pieces. They advertised these as being capable of being driven into almost any surface, including ice and rock. They also sold wooden stakes as part of their tents.
* Spoke in Spoke, a general store in Ruinspoke, sold wooden stakes.

* Stakes were used to keep tents securely in the ground, being driven through the edges of their covering or through special reinforced holes on the covering.
* Stakes could be placed upright on the bottom of a pit trap.
* Though a few claimed it hurt them no more than any other sharp weapon, stakes were often used in the act of slaying a vampire, vampire spawn, or even a vampiric dragon, an act known as "staking". This always immobilized a vampire when it was driven through their heart, though vampiric dragons required particularly large stakes. However, staking a vampire did not fully kill it and their bodies still needed to be properly destroyed, as otherwise the vampire would regenerate once the stake was removed. Even if a vampire had long since rotted away into dust, their bodies would be reconstituted within 72 hours of a stakes removal.
In 1358 DR in the nation of Shou Lung, some hunters from the village of Tebing ambushed an eastern vampire by the name of Xi-Chu in the jungle and struck him through the heart with a wooden stake.
* In the Domains of Dread, wooden stakes were a common tool of monster hunters.

* In the Great Glacier, the hunters of the village Imajuvisik would tie caribou or other game animals to a stake in the center of small valleys to act as bait for tirichik or white dragons.
