'''Stakes''' were a type of wooden or metal cylindrical post with a pointed end. They were similar to wooden [[peg]]s and metal [[spike]]s, but were generally much larger and more durable, being intended for outdoor use and rough conditions.

==Description==
[[File:VampireHunter'sKit.png|thumb|273px|''Wooden stakes sit alongside other vampire hunter supplies.]]
Stakes were typically made of either wood or some form of metal. They could even be made in the field by whittling down branches.

==Availability==
* [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']] sold stakes made of high-impact [[steel]] in sets of eight at a cost of 30 [[gold piece]]s. They advertised these as being capable of being driven into almost any surface, including ice and rock. They also sold wooden stakes as part of their [[tent]]s.
* [[Spoke in 'Spoke]], a general store in [[Ruinspoke]], sold wooden stakes.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|7}}
* Wooden stakes could be purchased in the city of [[Waterdeep]] as part of traveling gear.<ref>

==Usages==
[[File:StakingAVampire.png|thumb|250px|''Staking a vampire is a delicate affair.'']]
* Stakes were used to keep tents securely in the ground, being driven through the edges of their covering or through special reinforced holes on the covering.
* Stakes could be placed upright on the bottom of a pit trap.<ref>
* Though a few claimed it hurt them no more than any other sharp weapon,<ref> stakes were often used in the act of slaying a [[vampire]], [[vampire spawn]],<ref name=LM-p20-21,163" /><ref>{{Cite dragon/286/Vs.: Vampires}} or even a [[vampiric dragon]], an act known as "staking". This always immobilized a vampire when it was driven through their heart,<ref name=LM-p20-21,163" /> though vampiric dragons required particularly large stakes. However, staking a vampire did not fully kill it and their bodies still needed to be properly destroyed, as otherwise the vampire would regenerate once the stake was removed.<ref name=LM-p20-21,163"><ref> Even if a vampire had long since rotted away into dust, their bodies would be reconstituted within 72 hours of a stake's removal.<ref name=LM-p20-21,163" />

==History==
In [[1358 DR]] in the nation of [[Shou Lung]], some hunters from the village of [[Tebing]] ambushed an [[eastern vampire]] by the name of [[Xi-Chu]] in the jungle and struck him through the heart with a wooden stake.
