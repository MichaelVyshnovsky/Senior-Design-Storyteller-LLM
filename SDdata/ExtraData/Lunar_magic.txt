'''Lunar magic''' was a tradition of [[magic]] wherein the potency of [[spell]]s waxed and waned with the phases of the [[Selûne (moon)|moon]].

==Training==
Lunar magic could be learned by practitioners of [[arcane]] or [[divine]] magic, but they had to be followers of [[Selûne]], goddess of the [[moon]], or [[Mystra]], goddess of magic.

==Effects==
For a practitioner of lunar magic, the level at which they cast spells or wielded innate spell powers rose and fell in tune with the lunar phase. When the moon was full, on the 30{{th}}, 1{{st}}, and 2{{nd}} of each month,<ref group="note">The actual dates vary slightly from year to year. See the [[:Category:Years|Year page]] for the lunar calendar of any particular year. they experienced a slight boost. However, in the time of a new moon, on the 15{{th}}, 16{{th}}, and 17{{th}}, when the moon was dark, they suffered a slight decline.

==Practitioners==
Lunar magic was commonly learned by members of the [[church of Selûne]] in and around [[Waterdeep]]. Demonstrating lunar magic was also typically a test of entry to the [[Order of the Blue Moon]], an organization devoted to both Selûne and Mystra. It was definitely a requirement for the order's senior members, the [[Knight of the Blue Moon|Knights of the Blue Moon]], such as [[Xale of the Starry Glen]].

The [[moon knights]], a militant order of Selûnite soldier-priests, also practiced a form of lunar magic, though it affected all their abilities, their capacity to [[turn undead]], and even control over [[lycanthropy]]. The [[silver ladies]], an order of Selûnite priestesses, practiced something similar, affecting the success of their divinations, immunity to lycanthropy, and even effectiveness against [[Shar]]-worshipers.<ref group="note">Although not named or explicitly linked to the later-published lunar magic, given the close similarity and association with the Selûnite faith, the powers of moon knights are assumed to be lunar magic. The powers of silver ladies also correlate with the lunar cycle and might be treated as lunar magic.

==Views==
Around [[1372 DR]], lunar magic was little known to scholars of [[the Art]] who studied the different ways to access and manipulate the [[Weave]]. Thus demonstrations of lunar magic drew much interest and attention from them.
