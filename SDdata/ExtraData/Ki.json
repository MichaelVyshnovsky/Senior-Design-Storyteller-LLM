        "mainbody": "Ki''' ({{pronounce|kee|refs=}}), also called '''inner power''' or '''inner energy''', was a mystical energy of the body that could be used to fuel various powers by its practitioners. It was commonly used in [[Kara-Tur]]. Many monastic traditions knew it as ki, but other names were possible.",
        "Nature of Ki": "Ki was an internal energy of one's body, or life energy. It was a subtle energy, but it could be used to perform incredible feats by pushing the body to and beyond its physical limits. Mastery of ki gave one power over one's own body and over the bodies of others and even to steal ki from others.\n\nKi was variously considered to be similar to but distinct from the mental energy utilized in [[psionics]],<ref group=\"note\">During development of the Monk class for 4{{th}}-edition D&D, as discussed in \"Design & Development: The Monk\" in [[Dragon magazine 375|''Dragon'' #375]], the ki power source was changed to a psionic power source. However, the finished Monk class in ''[[Player's Handbook 3]]'' uses a \"ki focus\" as an implement. Pages 62 and 63 state monks \"channel their psionic energy through an item called a ki focus\", but page 203 says \"A ki focus is an implement that certain classes use as a focus for their inner magical energy, known as their ki.\" This may be a holdover from the ki-using Monk, but it is ambiguous as to whether ki is psionic or magical energy. and finally as a wholly magical energy or one whose application created magical effects. It was also theorized that the martial adepts of the [[Sublime Way]] drew on the power of ki and their own souls, but this was unproven. Of the magic that suffused the multiverse, ki was the element that flowed through living bodies, and was closely linked with [[elemental air]], as it depended strongly on the breath that linked the soul to the body. Thus, ki existed in all things that lived.",
        "Training": "The use of ki was aided significantly by intense training of the mind and self-contemplation,\n\nThe [[Do Jang of Won Kwang]], a military academy in [[Koryo]], taught its students techniques for enhancing and focusing ki. Students regularly spent hours each day working on this. Elsewhere, kensei honed their ki through mastering a particular weapon.\n\nPractitioners also studied detailed diagrams of the body that indicated the flow of ki through the body and its individual parts. These were associated with the body's pressure points that a martial artist might target.",
        "Ki Powers": "At its most basic, a [[bushi]] or [[samurai]] could give a fierce \"kiai\", a ki shout that boosted their fighting ability or strength, while a [[kensei]] could make a devastating attack against one or many foes. Even the low [[yakuza]] could use ki to sense and anticipate a foe's action and narrowly evade it.\n\nFocused ki enabled a practitioner to achieve great acts of endurance. It was said they could ignore the touch of hot coals or the bite of chill wind, live without food and drink for three times longer than normal, live in a harsh desert, and survive any catastrophe. Others could channel inner energy into their hands and fingers, so that even a gentle push could have a great impact, even without touching at all. Similarly, [[monk]]s could empower their unarmed strikes with ki, to strike with the force of magical, lawful, or even [[adamantine]] weapons,\n\nIn more advanced applications of ki, a monk or [[shukenja]] could resist the impact or harm of [[magic]] or other form of attack or heal an injury. A [[wu jen]] could focus ki to improve reactions and even summon considerable [[magic]]al energy with which to cast a [[spell]].\n\nHowever, ki was a finite resource: a practitioner might have limited uses of a power a day or not be able to use their greatest ki powers if they had already used their lesser ki powers that day. Some special strikes could disrupt the flow of ki in a foe.\n\nThe [[Ren Brothers]] developed new theories on ki and its cultivation and mastery, and even ways to use it to attain immortality.",
        "Practitioners": "Harnessing the power of ki energy was vital for many kinds of adventurers. The following paths were known for their use of ki powers, to a greater or lesser extent:\n* [[Bushi]]\n* [[Kensei]]\n* [[Monk]]\n* [[Ninja]]\n* [[Samurai]]\n* [[Shukenja]]\n* [[Sohei]]\n* [[Wu jen]]\n* [[Yakuza]]\n\nSoft [[:Category:martial arts|martial arts]] styles used inner power to provide energy and overcome an opponent and were usually defensively minded. Some martial arts made particular use of ki:\n* The [[Northern Fist School]] \"read\" an opponent's ki in order to make stunning or killing attacks at weak body parts and acupressure points.\n* The [[Southern Star School]] believed ki to be as dangerous as a physical attack and thus concentrated ki beyond the point of impact, permitting them to strike a target without touching it.\n* [[Tae kwon do]] taught at the Do Jang of Won Kwang employed focused ki for great endurance.\n* The [[Way of the Open Hand]] was based around ki and its use in healing and defense.",
        "Spells": "The ''[[aiming at the target]]'' spell for wu jen combined ki power, magic, and meditation. With precise breathing exercises and clearing and calming the mind, the spell was cast. It permitted the wu jen to perform other actions, even cast ''aiming at the target'', without breaking concentration on an existing spell.",
        "Items": "Channeling ki could be aided by a \"[[ki focus]]\", typically an item studied or used during meditation or training. This could be as a simple as a practice weapon, prayer beads, a training manual, or scroll of secret knowledge that the individual practitioner was attuned to. Some could themselves be enchanted items.\n\nOf the magical cards of the [[Edu'sascar]], \"Ki\", the symbol of the Power Within, could be used by a monk or shukenja to boost the ki powers of a congregation for a brief time.\n\nAn opal ''[[warfu stones|warfu stone]]'' could double one's ki power.",
        "Notable Ki Users": "Some individuals were known to be especially strong in ki:\n* Master [[Liu]] (Willow) of the Southern Star School\n* [[Shi Lo]], a student of the Southern Star School\n* [[Chen Ching Ch'ien]], a student of the [[Wang Ho School]]"
