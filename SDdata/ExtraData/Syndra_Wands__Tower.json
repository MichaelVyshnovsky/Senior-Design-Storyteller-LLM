It was constructed in Shoon style, which was rare for Waterdeep, as this style of architecture was native to Amn. The smooth stone walls were adorned with carved sigils and permeated by arrow slits. The door was on the northeast side, and was flanked by two minarets. At the top of the tower was a crystal pyramid, which marked the building as a noble house. As of 1238 DR, the approach to the tower was along a path through a herb garden.\nCategoryTowers\nCategoryLocations in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep\nCategoryLocations in Waterdeep\n5ks3436j6wcxcdvwifc8vbnmuta9p9u"
