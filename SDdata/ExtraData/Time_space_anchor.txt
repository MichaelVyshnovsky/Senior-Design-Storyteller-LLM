'''''Time/space anchor''''' was a [[psionic]] devotion of the [[psychoportation]] [[discipline]] that allowed the [[psionicist]] to protect themselves against unwanted ''[[teleport other|teleportation]]''.

==Effects==
Once a psionicist established a ''time/space anchor'' they could not be ''teleported'' against their will unless they lost a psychic contest. The area of protection was a sphere measuring {{SI|9|feet|long=yes}} centered on the psionicist. Anyone within the sphere was protected as well so long as the psionicist wanted them to be. Inanimate objects were protected automatically. The ''time/space anchor'' would remain in place as long as the psionicist continued to expend psychic energy.
