Time/space anchor was a psionic devotion of the psychoportation discipline that allowed the psionicist to protect themselves against unwanted teleportation.
Once a psionicist established a time/space anchor they could not be teleported against their will unless they lost a psychic contest. The area of protection was a sphere measuring  centered on the psionicist. Anyone within the sphere was protected as well so long as the psionicist wanted them to be. Inanimate objects were protected automatically. The time/space anchor would remain in place as long as the psionicist continued to expend psychic energy.
* Vhondryl, a psionicist in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor
