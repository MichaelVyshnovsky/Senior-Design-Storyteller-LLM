The Underchasm was a huge canyon created by the Spellplague in 1385 DR that ran roughly north to south from Akanûl to the borders of Halruaa. The chasm extended all the way to the Underdark.  The upper Underchasm was home to many flying monsters such as dragons. During the Second Sundering in 1486 DR. the quest of the four chosen (Kleef Kenric, Malik el Sami, Joelle Emmeline and Arietta Seasilver) to deliver the Eye of Gruumsh to Grumbar for Luthic and to stop Shar restored the canyon to its former earthly land before the Spellplague.
