The '''Underchasm''' was a huge canyon created by the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]] that ran roughly north to south from [[Akanûl]] to the borders of [[Halruaa]]. The chasm extended all the way to the [[Underdark]].  The upper Underchasm was home to many flying monsters such as [[dragon]]s. During the [[Second Sundering]] in [[1486 DR]]. the quest of the four chosen ([[Kleef Kenric]], [[Malik el Sami]], [[Joelle Emmeline]] and [[Arietta Seasilver]]) to deliver the [[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|''Eye of Gruumsh'']] to [[Grumbar]] for [[Luthic]] and to stop [[Shar]] restored the canyon to its former earthly land before the Spellplague.
