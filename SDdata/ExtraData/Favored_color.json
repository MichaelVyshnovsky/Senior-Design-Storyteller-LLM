        "Description": "Deities could show their powers through major manifestations and minor manifestations. A favored color fell into the latter category.\n\nMost deities had some kind of color as their favored color. It was considered a minor and subtle manifestation but it was also the most frequent. For example, [[Silvanus]] could turn a tree brilliant green to inform a fugitive follower of a good escape route.",
        "Mortals' Reaction": "Followers of a particular deity often dressed in the favored color, particularly the [[cleric]]s."
