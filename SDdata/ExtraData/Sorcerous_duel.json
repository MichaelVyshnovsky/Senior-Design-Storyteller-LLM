These duels were respected and honored throughout the Land of Fate.\nAll sorcerers in Zakhara abided by the rules of the sorcerous duel or faced harsh consequences from their superiors.\nSorcerous duels could not occur on a day that held religious significance for either of the participants. If the sorcerers belonged to a sorcerous society, then the heads of those societies were contacted about arranging the duel. It should be noted that two sorcerers from the same society rarely dueled since even suggesting a duel was usually enough to get them both expelled from their order. If the heads of the orders deemed the duel unnecessary, then the duel did not happen. A duel would be arranged for the nearest acceptable date, assuming the heads of the orders agreed that a sorcerous duel was the only way to resolve the issue.\nLocations for sorcerous duels were carefully selected, especially if the sorcerers involved were specialized in different elements. An area with large quantities of each sorcerers main element was preferred. If such a location could not be found, then an area with smaller quantities of each sorcerers main element was chosen instead.\nWith the date and location for the duel selected, the participants prepared themselves in whatever manner they deemed appropriate. Since a sorcerous duel was far more than simply throwing spells or engaging in martial combat, preparation was the key to success. \nSorcerers preparing for duels transformed their spells into raw magical energy that was stored within their body. This energy was expended during the duel by performing attack, defense, draining, and fortifying modes. The energy derived from spells was appropriate for the mode for which it would be used, as listed below\n* Offensive spell (fireball) – attack mode\n* Defensive spell (wall of stone) – defense mode\n* Negative altering spell (power word, blind) – draining mode\n* Positive altering spell, or a spell that created something (cool strength) – fortify mode \nFor example, offensive spells like fireball could only be converted into energy that was expended during an attack mode. \nIf the location for a sorcerous duel favored one sorcerer over the other by having larger quantities of their primary element, that sorcerer would gain more energy to add to their stored pool. Desperate sorcerers could convert their own life energy into magical energy to store in their pool as well. This was a risky choice since the sorcerer ran the risk of perishing during the duel if their magical energy was completely depleted.\nSorcerous duels existed in the minds of the combatants, so any uninvolved observers would find the whole ordeal rather boring. The key to winning a sorcerous duel lay in successfully predicting which mode ones opponent would use, and how much energy they would expend on their choice.\nThis action directly assaulted the opponent, draining energy from their defensive pool if successful.\nDefensive actions limited, or completely negated, an attack action depending on how much defensive energy was used.\nBy draining their opponent, a sorcerer was able to siphon energy from only one of their opponents energy pools. The victim of the drain might not even be aware that their magical energy had just been depleted.\nFortifying protected against drain attacks according to how much energy was expended into the fortification.\nA sorcerer usually accepted defeat once their magical energy was completely depleted since they had no defense against their opponents actions. \nThe winner of a sorcerous duel named the penalty of the loser. Generally speaking, the severity of the penalty was determined by the nature of the disagreement between the two sorcerers. Rematches for these duels never occurred.\nCategoryRituals\nCategoryDuels\ne91p2w6lpoukx3bll4hldy0o10vtmz4"
