Coinage within the nation of Thay was rarely minted, as by the 15 century DR they used the coinage of other realms as much as possible.
The standard Thayan-minted coins were flat plagues,  tall, in the shape of an inverted simple keystone ("tall" trapezoids with the small end at the top). They bore the symbol of Thaymount on both sides, in opposite vertical orientations, with a hole pierced in their center to allow for stringing multiple coins together on a ring. Each was made of the metal or alloy that they represented &ndash copper, silver, electrum, gold, and platinum.
In the realms outside of Thay, many shunned Thayan coinage out of a common fear that the coins would be magically cursed. In the 14 century DR, Thayan coins were occasionally found in use in the nation of Tethyr, though only be the most experienced and traveled of merchants.
