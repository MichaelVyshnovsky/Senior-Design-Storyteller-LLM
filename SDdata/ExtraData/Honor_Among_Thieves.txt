==Development==
===Warner Bros. ===
The story began with a screenplay called ''Chainmail'', or ''Untitled Dungeons & Dragons Project'', written by [[Wikipedia:David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick|David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick]] (''Wrath of the Titans'') in 2011/2012. It was named for and apparently based on the [[Wikipedia:Chainmail (game)|''Chainmail'']] miniatures wargame developed by [[Gary Gygax]] and Jeff Perren that was a precursor to ''Dungeons & Dragons''. [[Wikipedia:Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.]] executive Jon Berg had asked Johnson to develop a screenplay based on D&D, despite Warner Bros. not then having the rights. Described as an action-adventure fantasy film, Johnson's script was well received at Warner Bros. in August 2012.{{cite web

However, only a day later, it was reported [[Wikipedia:Hasbro|Hasbro]], owners of [[Wizards of the Coast]] and therefore D&D, were arguing the movie rights were theirs and furthermore were planning a movie with [[Wikipedia:Universal Studios Hollywood|Universal Studios]], directed by Chris Morgan (writer of the ''Fast & Furious'' franchise and ''47 Ronin'').{{cite web

}} This was the first connection of either movie to the ''Forgotten Realms'' setting.

There followed much complicated legal wrangling beyond the scope of a D&D wiki, but it did depend on whether ''[[Wikipedia:Dungeons & Dragons 3: The Book of Vile Darkness|The Book of Vile Darkness]]'' was a sequel to the previous ''Dungeons & Dragons'' and ''[[Wikipedia:Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God|Wrath of the Dragon God]]'' movies. They, and D&D fandom, will never know the answer to that question as, following a six-day trial in September 2014, Hasbro, Warner Bros., and Sweetpea settled out of court on the rights to a D&D movie.{{cite web

}} On August 3, 2015, it was reported they planned to make the D&D movie together, continuing the Warner Bros. project with the involvement of Hasbro's chief executive [[Wikipedia:Brian Goldner|Brian Goldner]] and chief content officer Stephen Davis as producers. According to Greg Silverman, president of creative development and worldwide production at Warner Bros., "We are so excited about bringing the world of Dungeons & Dragons to life on the big screen. This is far and away the most well-known brand in fantasy, which is the genre that drives the most passionate film followings. D&D has endless creative possibilities, giving our filmmakers immense opportunities to delight and thrill both fans and moviegoers new to the property." Still using Johnson's ''Chainmail'' script, it was said to be set in the ''Forgotten Realms''.{{cite web

}} In an interview with Collider at DICE 2016, Roy Lee suggested the Warner Bros. movie would be an ensemble picture, with a group of main characters, and have an adventurous feel, commenting "This new ''Dungeons & Dragons'' will be a ''Guardians of the Galaxy''–tone movie in a Tolkien-like universe. Because when you think of all the ''Hobbit'' movies and ''The Lord of the Rings'', they have an earnestness to them, and to see something fun, a ''Raiders'' romp inside that world, I feel is something the audience has not seen before." Of Warner Bros., he said "I believe they see ''Dungeons & Dragons'' as something that could be cultivated as a multi-universe movie where there will be spinoffs from the first movie being in ''Forgotten Realms'' and subsequent movies being in different worlds." He also promised it would go deep into the source material and that the writer and others were all long-term D&D fans: "everyone who's involved with it now, especially the writer of the first draft is a fan from the very beginning starting with Chainmail, which turned into Dungeons & Dragons, so you'll see things that are very faithful to the source material as well as new elements are being incorporated with help from Wizards of the Coast, who are giving a lot of input on the script." He revealed the movie would be entirely set within the ''Forgotten Realms'', with the [[Yawning Portal Inn]] being a prominent feature and set piece of the movie.{{cite web

}} Daley learned to play D&D while playing a geek character in ''Freaks and Geeks''. In a later interview with FANDOM, Daley said "I'm an avid player... it's set in a fictional world that our DM created, but it definitely utilizes a lot of the creatures and monsters from the manual." and "I also play a video game with my son ''Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom'' and ''Shadow over Mystara''... it's a nice bonding moment for us. So it's very much in my DNA at this point." He added "I'm a half-elf paladin, and I've been that for the last five years." His character's name is mentioned in the movie; "That was the most exciting moment for me, not seeing my name on the screen but hearing my character." but noted "he's not representative of the character that I created for myself, it was really just a name check."

Two days later, a source told wegotthiscovered.com that Goldstein and Daley were trying to get [[Wikipedia:Zac Efron|Zac Efron]] to play an important character named Malanthius, a big but not leading role.{{cite web

Their plans to scout locations in the United Kingdom in March were curtailed by the shutdown of travel, and they wrote the second draft while in isolation, while large crowd scenes were being reconsidered. Goldstein said "We want it to be fun. It's not an out-and-out comedy, but it is an action-fantasy movie with a lot of comedic elements and characters we hope people will really get into and enjoy watching their adventures." while Daley said "D&D is such a unique look at the fantasy genre where it is contemporary in terms of the people playing it and the way they speak to each other. So we never wanted to spoof the genre of fantasy or take the piss out of it. But we did want to find another way into it that we hadn't necessarily seen before. Just the format of Dungeons & Dragons is so interesting and fun and all about critical thinking and thinking on your feet and figuring out ways to make things work after they fall flat. There's a lot of the spirit of that that we're trying to inject into the movie itself."{{cite web

To integrate the storyline with the lore of D&D and the ''Forgotten Realms'' during writing and production, Goldstein and Daley had the involvement of Wizards of the Coast representatives Nathan Stewart, Head of Franchise and VP of Global Brand Marketing & Strategy, and [[Jeremy Crawford]], Principal Designer for D&D. Goldstein said in the interview with FANDOM, "Wizards of the Coast generally were involved very much throughout the process in the writing stage and on set, and we would consult them with any questions we had, any issues we had. And they were really helpful because—it wasn't in the spirit of 'you can't do that', it was 'let us help you figure out how you can do that in the world we've created'. Latcham added "Yeah, and Nathan and Jeremy at Wizards were just like tremendously helpful and still are." and gave an example of ensuring accuracy in a map presented in the film, adding "Because some things you're looking for authenticity and some thing's you're looking for accuracy and I think in that case accuracy would be appreciated... It's usually like how do we do this inside the world and make it right, and then sometimes it's like how do we make the movie exist in the world more specifically and so, it's really fun." Daley said "We actually went up to Wizards of the Coast headquarters in Seattle and did a crash course in some of the lesser-known aspects of the game and it was wildly helpful and we ended up incorporating a ton of stuff in the movie just from that meeting." They also had assistance from Ashley Alexander, Senior Director of Film Development & Sales at eOne and a producing partney; Daley said she "is like a bonafide D&D nerd who knows way more than i do about it and she was an invaluable resource." They also made use of D&D Beyond, with Latcham saying "We all had all-the-time access to D&D Beyond so it's just like 'okay, hold on, hold on, no that's not right', and the actor is like 'what's happening?' and we're 'we'll get back to you in one second, we have to work something out'." But most importantly, when asked "How much did you use the Forgotten Realms Wiki for research, Daley answered "A ton, a ton! ...Honestly, sometimes on-set."{{cite web

[[Wikipedia:Dexter Fletcher|Dexter Fletcher]] (''Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'', ''Rocketman'') revealed in an interview with Alex Zane of the Just the Facts podcast, released June 2, that he had a small role in the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' movie: "I just did Dungeons & Dragons as well... I only did it the other day as a favor, for a mate... Marlamin, he's called. I am Michelle Rodriguez's ex-husband... I think I'm a goodie. It's hard for me to say, because I've got one scene where she comes and sees me, in my little house. I'm really diminutive, I've got a very tall wife... They gave me one scene, I don't know what that's about... They were like 'Can you come and do this one scene, it'll just be really lovely.' ...I had a big beard."{{cite web

And a dog: Antilly, a German Shepherd from Stunt Dogs and Animals, (''After Life'' and ''Treason'') appears in some scenes, it was later reported.

On the first day of production, rather than rehearsing, the cast and directors played a game of D&D together. Daley would recall, "The first day, rather than using our precious time to rehearse, we decided to play a three-plus hour game. The Wizards of the Coast were nice enough to give us a Dungeon Master on Zoom and we played. And it was hilarious and really educational, because I think they all learned about their characters more, and I think we incorporated some of the things that came out of that."

A few prominent boats were seen at Carrickfergus Castle. The most notable is a large black-hulled vessel covered over with spiked armored plates, with a single mast with dark-blue sails, and a battering ram ending in a [[copper dragon]] head, colored to resemble old copper. It resembles a [[Wikipedia:turtle ship|Korean geobukseon (or turtle ship)]]. Coleman, Lillis, Pine, Rodriguez, and Smith appeared have scenes on board.{{cite web

In an interview with Collider on September 9, Justice Smith said of the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' movie "[Goldstein and Daley are] incredible. They're so funny and they have such clear vision. I loved ''Game Night''. That movie is so good and so funny. And it's such a clear, specific story. It doesn't try and be anything that it's not. I think they approached this the same way. I can't spoil too much but it's action-packed, thrilling, funny as hell… it's all of the things and yet it has a clear idea. That specificity is key in storytelling and John and Jonathan do that so well, being like, "This is the story we're telling but they're making it enjoyable the entire time." This is me not trying to spoil the movie in any regards. I've given away no details."{{cite web

Chris Pine, when asked about the movie in an interview with Collider published on March 18, 2022, said "Well, what I will say is we had a hell of a fun time making it. There was a lot of laughs. The way that I've been describing it, it's like [[Wikipedia:Game of Thrones|''Game of Thrones'']] mixed with a little [[Wikipedia:The Princess Bride (film)|''Princess Bride'']], just a smidge of [[Wikipedia:Monty Python and the Holy Grail|''Holy Grail'']]; it's somewhere in that ballpark. It's a lot of fun. It's got a lot of thrills. It's poppy, it's eighties heartfelt, there's a bit of [[Wikipedia:Goonies|''Goonies'']] in there. My character, he's the ultimate party planner. I think it's going to be really good. I mean, who —ing knows, but I think we got a good shot and John and John are killer guys. They know comedy and they know heart and we had a great cast and we had a good time making it. And that's all you can ask for."{{cite web

The D&D Direct online event on April 22, 2022, viewable [https://youtu.be/FMHspJ92-hg?t=1019 here], had a teaser video revealing the full logo and title of the movie: ''Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves''. Daley and Goldstein together said "Hi, I'm John Francis Daley, and I'm Jonathan Goldstein. After years of being devoted players, we, like you, have been spent a lot of time imagining the incredible places, characters, and limitless adventure that D&D offers. We could not be more excited to bring this world to the big screen. We just wrapped shooting in some of the most incredible locations. It's a dream come true to bring the ''Forgotten Realms'' and the Sword Coast to life. We set out to capture the spirit of fun and surprise that we all love about D&D. Thank you to our awesome partners at Wizards of the Coast, but most importantly thank you to you, the greatest fans in the world. It's going to be in theaters March 2023.

In an interview with IGN on February 19{{th}} at IGN Fan Fest, Daley and Goldstein revealed the movie would have no meta narrative, that is, there would be no scenes of gameplay in real-world nor characters from [[Earth]] falling into the ''Forgotten Realms'' as had often been speculated in press. Daley: "This is not ''Jumanji''. We talked about it, but we made a decision that we did not want to break the fourth wall. There's so much fun to be had just in the world of D&D that we didn't have to bring it into our world and show kids playing." Goldstein: "We felt, in fact, that it would be sort of limiting the absolute scope of this world if we were to sort of put it through the lens of a game being played." On adherence to D&D rules, Goldstein also noted "We definitely played by the rule of cool when it came to how much we adhere to the game mechanics. Very often, I think we do have a lot of turn-based action. And all the spells and monsters and creatures that they come across are authentic to the lore, but we definitely took some liberties to give you the most action-packed fun that we could."{{cite web

[[File:D&D movie Gwaeron.jpg|thumb|right|''And now Gwaeron Windstrom.'']]
In early May, 2022, Forgotten Realms Wiki editors conducted independent research and discovered clues revealing scenes set in the town of [[Triboar]], but are not at liberty to share the full evidence. Images of a battle with three boars, ornamental shields bearing three boar heads, processions of warriors, and a depiction of the god [[Gwaeron Windstrom]] all point to Triboar. This was the [[Triboar playhouse]] see in ''Honor Among Thieves''.

In addition, the banners at Alnwick Castle were found to display letters in the [[Thorass alphabet]]. Though jumbled, they read 'The Highsun Games' or 'The High Sun Games', referring to the arena battle held in Neverwinter at the end of the movie.

In late July, 2022, following the trailer release, Forgotten Realms Wiki editors discovered a leaked fragment of the ''Honor Among Thieves'' script dated to late 2020. Character names and story details were confirmed by the trailer, official synopsis, character details, novelization, and eventually the movie itself. It is presented at [[Forum:Honor Among Thieves script leak]]; it contains minor spoilers.

===Past Story Rumors===
[[File:Everybody Wants to Run the Realms page 15.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The first screening probably won't go like this.'']]
With many prior incarnations of the script, there has been a variety of rumored storylines for the movie. On movie-industry spec script resource The Tracking Board, the logline given for the original ''Chainmail'' script on September 18, 2012, read:
{{quote|Centers on a warrior and his band of mystical creatures who embark on a dangerous journey to find a mythical treasure.}}
This would expand slightly over time, with the logline for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' on August 3, 2015, (after the Hasbro/Warner Bros. partnership on the movie) reading:
{{quote|Based on the iconic game, a warrior and his band of mystical creatures – including a half-dragon and a cunning gnome – embark on a dangerous journey to find a mythical treasure.}}
Industry publication [https://www.productionweekly.com/ Production Weekly] gave a similar description as late as April 8, 2021:
{{quote|The action-adventure tale centers on Edgin (Pine) a warrior and his band of mystical creatures – including a half-dragon and a cunning gnome – as they embark on a dangerous journey to find a mythical treasure.}}
This aligns closely with the following rumors and reports, but may also be out-of-date or falsified as this version dates back to the original Johnson-McGoldrick ''Chainmail'' script for Warner Bros., before the Gilio rewrite for Paramount. It is unknown what, if anything, remains of the original storyline; Johnson-McGoldrick's name is no longer attached, only Gilio's, but the ''Chainmail'' working title is retained. Furthermore, the Universal ''Forgotten Realms: Dungeons & Dragons'' may have been used instead or merged with ''Chainmail''. Nevertheless, this description was updated to include Chris Pine and the Edgin character, who presumably replaces Raven Hightower.

On June 27, 2016, [http://www.aintitcool.com/node/75566 Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News] claimed to have seen Johnson-McGoldrick's first draft of the script. Apparently named ''Dungeons & Dragons: The Hand of Chaos'', it is an "Object Quest style D&D story", described as more like ''Indiana Jones'' than ''Warcraft'', with "competitors and traitors and all manners of magic and monsters and Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson inspired awesomery throughout." Characters include Raven Hightower, played by Ansel Elgort; a gnome cutpurse, a bald [[warlock]], and a half-dragon, possibly fighting a [[gnoll]] at some point.{{cite web

Both also revolve around the gold dragon Palarandusk and the [[Triadic knight|Triadic Knights]]. Comicbook.com added that they are "looking for the [[Eye of Vecna]]".

Characters previously reported, possibly for earlier scripts, are:
* Raven Hightower, a warrior with a magical flaming sword and wearing leather armor and oiled cloak. He has long hair, a beard, and dark sunken eyes. He and his sister were once slaves, possibly of Razer Horlbar. He is an honorable man but haunted by his sister's death. He explores "the Demon Temples" alongside Zanril and Karroway. A leading male role in 88 scenes. (Possibly replaced by Edgin.)
*Hack Karroway, a [[half-dragon]] and former [[human]]. He can breathe fire, wielded a large bastard sword and wears armor. He is 7 feet tall and has a long tail, and blood-red scales. He is logical and intelligent. He explores "the Demon Temples" alongside Hightower and Zanril. A leading male role in 77 scenes played via voice-over.
*Otivan Trickfoot or Olivan Trickfoot, a [[gnome]] thief. He is cunning and untrustworthy. He wears magical rings. A strong supporting male role in 51 scenes.
*Alyssa Steelsong, the leader of "the masked warriors" and set to take Palarandusk's place as Lord Protector of the Triadic Knights after his death. She uses a mace. A strong supporting female role in 41 scenes.
*Malanthius, a spellcaster. He is young, slender, and has long hair. A potential ally of the main characters; an important but not leading role. A strong supporting male role in 26 scenes. (This character has a very similar name and occupation as the [[Magister]] [[Malanthus Stormstaern]].)
*Palarandusk, an ancient [[gold dragon]] and Lord Protector of a group of Triadic Knights. He has catfish-like whiskers and his scales are cracked and spines dangling. He eats gemstones. A supporting male role in 3 scenes. Palarandusk is a gold dragon known to be a protector of Neverwinter and [[Ieirithymbul]]), while "Lord Protector" is a title for leaders of Neverwinter like [[Dagult Neverember]]. Palarandusk, with his original title as the Unseen Protector, is confirmed to appear in the final movie by the [https://www.amazon.com/NERF-MicroShots-Dungeons-Dragons-Palarandusk/dp/B0B1VVXMGB/ NERF MicroShots Dungeons & Dragons Palarandusk Blaster].
*Razer Horlbar, an [[elf]] and leader of "the cloaked men", including Damaia and The Beast. He is the main villain and once enslaved Raven and his sister. He is handsome, has jet-black skin, long white hair, and pointed ears. A supporting male role in 14 scenes. (Presumably he is a [[drow]] and a member of [[House Horlbar]].)
*Damaia or Damala, a [[tiefling]] descended from demons who has horns, a long tail, and pointed teeth. A supporting female role in 10 scenes. ("Damaia" is a suggested female tiefling name in ''[[Player's Handbook 4th edition]]'' and ''[[Player's Handbook 5th edition]]''.)
*The Beast, a brutish warrior. He is huge and wears a cloak and a blank wooden mask. A supporting male role in 9 scenes.
*Bickety, a human swordsman and adventurer with a scarred face. A supporting male role in 9 scenes.
*Zanril, a warlock adventurer. He's bald. He explores "the Demon Temples" alongside Hightower and Karroway. A supporting male role in 9 scenes.
*Skeever, a [[half-orc]] adventurer. A supporting male role in 7 scenes.
