The Narnpool was a pool within the Hallows of Cormanthyr.
The Narnpool lay in the center of a clearing, and had a semicircular stone bench on its edge.
In , Symrustar Auglamyr took the newly named human armathor Elminster to the Narnpool during a revel, looking for more privacy. However, their frolicking was interrupted by several sword-wielding elves she cast a spell that translocated the two of them to her private chambers, leaving behind a small statue of herself, with her arms bound at her sides.
After one of the elves struck the statuette with a sword, it exploded. The heirs killed included those of Houses Yeschant, Amarthen, Ibryiil, Gwaelon, Tassarion, Bellas, and Leayonadas Ortauré of House Ortauré. A later retelling claimed to a dozen or so servants slain. Other reported casualties included revelers by the names of Arandron and Inchel.
