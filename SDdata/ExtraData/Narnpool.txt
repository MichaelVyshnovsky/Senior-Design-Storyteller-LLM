The '''Narnpool''' was a pool within the [[Hallows]] of [[Cormanthyr]].

==Description==
The Narnpool lay in the center of a clearing, and had a semicircular stone bench on its edge.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|203-205|10}}

==History==
In {{yearlink|241}}, [[Symrustar Auglamyr]] took the newly named [[human]] [[armathor]] [[Elminster]] to the Narnpool during a revel, looking for more privacy. However, their frolicking was interrupted by several sword-wielding [[elves]]; she cast a spell that translocated the two of them to her private chambers, leaving behind a small statue of herself, with her arms bound at her sides.

After one of the elves struck the statuette with a [[sword]], it exploded.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|212|11}} The heirs killed included those of Houses [[Yeschant]], [[Amarthen]], [[Ibryiil]], [[Gwaelon]], [[Tassarion]], [[Bellas]], and [[Leayonadas Ortauré]] of House [[Ortauré]]. A later retelling claimed to a dozen or so servants slain.{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|234|12}} Other reported casualties included revelers by the names of [[Arandron (elf)|Arandron]] and [[Inchel]].{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|209|11}}
