Legacy of the Green Regent was an RPGA campaign based mostly in the Delimbiyr Vale.
28 modules were supposedly written over 3 years to be distributed to registered Dungeon Masters and played at events such as GenCon and Winter Fantasy. These modules were then supposed to be made commercially available. Five modules were never published and a 29th module never got off the drawing board. None of them were ever sold commercially.
As part of the RPGA Network, the Legacy of the Green Regent adventures were made available in print being black and white booklets, sometimes with poster maps and stats cards.
