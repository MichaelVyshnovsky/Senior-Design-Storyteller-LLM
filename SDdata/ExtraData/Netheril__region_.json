Starting in , the phaerimm started casting spells that caused the lush land to change into desert. Such was the change that, in 10 DR, the region became known as Anauroch to reflect the desert that it had become.\nIn 1372 DR, the city of Thultanthar returned to this region. The Spellplague and other forces had an even greater impact and by 1479 DR the desert was gone and a new land had arisen.\n* - A Map of Netheril in the Golden Age\n* - A Map of the East part of Anauroch, as Netheril was known as at that time, in 1372 DR. \n* - Netheril in 1479 DR\nCategoryLocations in North Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nahmfinyooxqsq9e8z4bwqkbefyaghpp"
