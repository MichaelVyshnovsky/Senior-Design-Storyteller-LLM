Starting in {{Yearlink|-461}}, the phaerimm started casting spells that caused the lush land to change into desert. Such was the change that, in [[10 DR]], the region became known as [[Anauroch]] to reflect the desert that it had become.\n\nIn [[1372 DR]], the city of [[Thultanthar]] returned to this region. The [[Spellplague]] and other forces had an even greater impact and by [[1479 DR]] the desert was gone and a new land had arisen.",
