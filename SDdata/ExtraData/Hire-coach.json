        "mainbody": "thumb|300px|A hire-coach traversing the Castle Ward.\nHire-coaches were two-seat coaches with drivers that were used as hired transportation of small groups of passengers to customized locations. They were part of the public transportation system of Waterdeep.\nWaterdhavian hire-coaches were comfortable, two-wheeled black vehicles. They could seat two passengers comfortably, but could hold a maximum of four. The driver sat on an elevated seat located at the carriages rear, commanding the horse through long reigns and a short whip mounted on a rod.\nFares were always negotiated and paid in advance, rarely exceeding 6 shards.\nDuring winter, fewer hire-coaches remained in service, but the Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen, the Wheelwrights Guild, and the Wagon-makers and Coach Builders Guild worked together to convert some hire-coaches into sledges, so that they remained fully operational throughout the harshest parts of the season.\nHire-coach drivers occasionally found amusement when tourists, unaccustomed to the ease of travel between wards of Waterdeep, asked for rides across adjacent wards that could be accessed by simply crossing the street."
