The '''Purse Master''' of [[Baldur's Gate]] was an officer position entrusted with managing the city's finances along with the stewardship over their gold stores. Due to its high-level of complexity, along with the great amount of trust placed with a single individual, it was the most difficult title to attain in Baldur's Gate. It was a title that attracted the ire and hatred of many, as it held great power and tremendous influence.

Its responsibilities included overseeing city-wide financial record-keepers, managing tax collectors, investing city funds, and the distribution of salaries and regular pay. In addition, they made sure the [[Flaming Fist]] did not take more than its share of the taxes they collected.
