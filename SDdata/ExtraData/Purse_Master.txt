The Purse Master of Baldurs Gate was an officer position entrusted with managing the citys finances along with the stewardship over their gold stores. Due to its high-level of complexity, along with the great amount of trust placed with a single individual, it was the most difficult title to attain in Baldurs Gate. It was a title that attracted the ire and hatred of many, as it held great power and tremendous influence.
Its responsibilities included overseeing city-wide financial record-keepers, managing tax collectors, investing city funds, and the distribution of salaries and regular pay. In addition, they made sure the Flaming Fist did not take more than its share of the taxes they collected.
* Haxilion Trood, 1480s DR
