Mind blank was a psionic devotion of the telepathy discipline that allowed the psionicist to hide their mind from psionic attacks.
Mind blank created a vast featureless void in the psionicists mind, making it extremely difficult for others to target their mind. Though highly effective against an id insinuation attack, mind blank was susceptible to a mind thrust.
* Vhondryl, a psionicist in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor
