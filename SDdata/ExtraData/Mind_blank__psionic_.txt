'''''Mind blank''''' was a [[psionic]] devotion of the [[telepathy]] [[discipline]] that allowed the [[psionicist]] to hide their mind from psionic attacks.

==Effects==
''Mind blank'' created a vast featureless void in the psionicist's mind, making it extremely difficult for others to target their mind. Though highly effective against an ''[[id insinuation]]'' attack, ''mind blank'' was susceptible to a ''[[mind thrust]]''.

==Notable Users==
===Individuals===
* [[Vhondryl]], a psionicist in [[Skullport]] and head of the [[Hall of Mental Splendor]]{{Cite dragon/172/Seeing the Sights in Skullport|12, 14, 88}}
