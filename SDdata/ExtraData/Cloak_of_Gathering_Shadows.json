        "mainbody": "he Cloak of Gathering Shadows was a ritual used by shairs to grant their gen the ability to hide within shadows with ease.\nThis ritual required a spider web found beneath the shadow of a rock. The web needed to at least be large enough to cover the upper body of the gen. Additionally, the ritual needed the hair of a stealthy individual, typically a holy slayer or skilled thief.\nThe spider web was fixed to the gens back during the 18 hour ritual, granting the gen the ability to hide in the shadows like a skilled thief. The chance of hiding was increased if a more skilled shair completed the ritual."
