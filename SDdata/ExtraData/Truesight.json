Creatures with truesight could, out to a specific range, see in both normal and magical darkness. As well as that, they could see invisible creatures and objects and automatically see through visual illusions (to reveal the original form of a creature or shapeshifter).\nThose with truesight could also see into the ethereal plane within the same range of their normal truesight abilities.\nSome mages could cast true seeing, giving them temporary access to this sense.\nCategoryCreature special abilities\n7v7jpknnm31o8gppmgslcvdeddsa020"
