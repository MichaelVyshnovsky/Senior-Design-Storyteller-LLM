There were eight zulkirs, one for each [[Magic#Schools|school of magic]]; together they formed the [[Council of Zulkirs]] which ruled the Red Wizards and, by extension, Thay itself. They did not directly control the country, as the day-to-day governing was left to the [[tharchion]]s.\n\nZulkirs held their positions for life and for undeath, or until they renounced the title. When a position opened, wizards of the same school of magic selected the replacement, but other zulkirs often tried to sway the election, making the appointment an intrigue-filled and ruthless event.\n\nFollowing the [[War of the Zulkirs]], seven of the most powerful [[lich]]es serving under the High Regent [[Szass Tam]] were appointed as zulkirs. While they acted as his stewards and carried out his will, they maintained the previous hierarchy that saw them delegate day-to-day governance to the provincial tharchions.",
