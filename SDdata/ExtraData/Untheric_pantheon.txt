The '''Untheric pantheon''' were originally housed on the plane of [[Zigguraxus]], brought over from another world by slaves imported into [[Faerûn]] by [[Imaskar]].  Like the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]], the Untheric gods were initially barred from contact with their followers by a planar barrier erected by the Imaskari; however, also like the Mulhorandi gods, they bypassed this problem by sending physical manifestations of themselves to [[Toril]] via the [[Astral Plane]].  With their divine power backing them, their followers were able to overthrow the Imaskari and build a civilisation for themselves.

The pantheon made few friends among the other gods, but many enemies then, during the [[Orcgate Wars]], the pantheon was devastated by the loss of seven of its members at the hands of the [[Orc]] [[deities]] while another, Tiamat, was banished to the [[Nine Hells]].

[[Gilgeam]] became more and more despotic over time and grew to be hated by the people of Unther. When the last of Tiamat's cultists summoned an aspect of her, she began to forment plans to overthrow the God-king and she regained her status as a god with the resulting swell of worshipers who shared her goal.

Everything came to a head during the [[Time of Troubles]]. Tiamat brazenly attacked [[Gilgeam]] but was seemingly killed in the battle. Due to Tiamat's decade-long planning her essence was soon reformed into a new body and she again attacked Gilgeam. Surprised and weakened, Gilgeam was killed. Soon after, Assuran killed his enemy Ramman. With only two gods of the pantheon left, rather than share power, Tiamat and Assuran joined the [[Faerûnian pantheon]] instead, dissolving the Untheric pantheon and making Zigguraxus disappear.

The members of the Untheric pantheon were as follows:
*[[Hoar|Assuran]] ([[Demigod]] of retribution and revenge who joined the Faerûnian pantheon as [[Hoar]])
*[[Enlil]], the patriarch of the Untheric gods. ([[Greater deity]] of air, luck, war and good). He abdicated in favor of his son Gilgeam and left [[Toril]] in {{Yearlink|-734}}. During the [[Second Sundering]] on [[Nightal 26]] [[1486 DR]], he returned to Toril as a [[lesser deity]] and chosen the [[dragonborn]] race as his new protégés.
*[[Gilgeam]] ([[Intermediate deity]] later demigod of tyranny and strength; killed during Time of Troubles)
*[[Girru]] (Lesser deity of fire; killed during the Orcgate Wars)
*[[Inanna]] (Greater deity of love and war; she was killed during the Orcgate Wars)
*[[Ishtar]] (Lesser deity of love and war) Shortly after the departure of Enlil, Ishtar gave the power of her manifestation to [[Isis]] and vanished from Toril as well.
*[[Ki (goddess)|Ki]] (Greater deity of nature; she was killed during Orcgate Wars)
*[[Marduk]], an [[aspect]] of [[Bahamut]] of the [[Draconic pantheon]]. (Greater deity of cities, wind, thunder, storms, and rain; mutual suicide with Tiamat during the Orcgate Wars)
*[[Nanna-Sin]] (Lesser deity of the moon; killed during the Orcgate Wars)
*[[Nergal (deity)|Nergal]] (Evil god of the underworld and the dead; killed during the Orcgate Wars)
*[[Ramman]] (Lesser deity of war and storms; killed by Assuran during the Time of Troubles) Portfolio secured by [[Anhur]] postmortem.
*[[Tiamat]], a three-headed [[Draconic pantheon|draconic]] goddess of chaos and evil. ([[Lesser deity]], then [[archfiend]], then demigod, now a lesser [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] power)
*[[Utu]] (Greater deity of the sun; killed during the Orcgate Wars)
