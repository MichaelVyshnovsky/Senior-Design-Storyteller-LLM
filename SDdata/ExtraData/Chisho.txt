The era of '''Chisho''' was the first period of time in the mythological pre-history of the nation of [[Wa]], also known as the '''Age of Kochi, Master of the Peach Tree'''.

==Description==
The era of Chisho began in ancient memory, at least three millennia before the founding of the [[Standing Stone]] in the [[Dalelands]].<ref group="note">This dating is estimated from the statement in ''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]''  that the [[shugenja]] [[Samon]] died "nearly 2,000 years ago". The ''Kara-Tur'' sourcebook is set in [[1357 DR]], and ''[[Blood of the Yakuza]]'' gives the year of Samon's death as the 23{{rd}} year of [[Kuni]]. The era of Kuni followed (not immediately) the era of Chisho, and the era of Chisho was 412 years long, placing the start of Chisho at more than 2,000 + 412 + 23 = 2,435 years before the start of the [[Wa calendar]], which itself was about 600 years before the start of the [[Dalereckoning]]. This first era of Wanese history was said to have begun with the [[Spirit of Wa]]'s gift of the [[Sacred Wand]] and the [[Moonlight Arrow]] to [[Kochi]], Master of the Peach Tree, the first emperor of Wa. These sacred items became the emblems of the nation and allowed Kochi to rule over the entire island.

Emperor Kochi was said to have lived for 412 years. His rule was romanticized as an idyllic age of unity, This was also the time when the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] began to consider Wa in new light, even establishing new administrative offices related to the land.

==History==
Upon the death of the era's only emperor, a great civil war erupted, called the [[War of the Spirits]], in which the [[spirit]]s of the land fought against the [[human]]s. The [[spirit folk]] of Wa were split; half of them joined with the spirits of the land, while the other half allied with the humans. The [[korobokuru]] began the war as a neutral party but later turned to join the spirits. [[Hengeyokai]] happily fought for both sides of the epic conflict. The War of the Spirits divided the island once unified under Kochi into numerous warring, petty clans. The war finally ended with the ascension of Emperor [[Kasada]], who united the nation and was presented with the the Moonlight Arrow by the Spirit of [[Yakamashi Mountain]]. He named the new era [[Koyo]].
