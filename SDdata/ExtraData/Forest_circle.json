        "mainbody": "'''forest circle''' was a [[druid circle]] associated with the great communities of [[tree]]s that covered a great part of [[Faer√ªn]]. [[Druid]]s who took up the cause of nature in such a region had an affinity for this circle and the suite of [[spell]]s that came to them without cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).",
        "Forest circle spells": "Druids new to the forest circle were able to cast both ''[[barkskin]]'' and ''[[spider climb]]''. Those that had advanced knowledge of this circle could cast ''[[call lightning]]'', ''[[plant growth]]'', ''[[divination (spell)|divination]]'', and ''[[freedom of movement]]''. Druids with even more knowledge and skill could cast ''[[commune with nature]]'' and ''[[tree stride]]''."
