        "mainbody": "he forest circle was a druid circle associated with the great communities of trees that covered a great part of Faer√ªn. Druids who took up the cause of nature in such a region had an affinity for this circle and the suite of spells that came to them without cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).\nDruids new to the forest circle were able to cast both barkskin and spider climb. Those that had advanced knowledge of this circle could cast call lightning, plant growth, divination, and freedom of movement. Druids with even more knowledge and skill could cast commune with nature and tree stride."
