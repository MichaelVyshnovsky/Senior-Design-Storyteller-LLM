[[File:Neverwinter Eye.jpg|thumb|''The Neverwinter Eye symbol.''|340x340px]]
The '''''Neverwinter Eye''''', also known as the '''''Eye & Tears''''', was a symbol popularized in the city of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], and still retained its presence in the late 15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}

{{quote|Aye, that's a new one since the plague here. The "''Neverwinter Eye''" be another name it goes by. A slitted eye, all reptile-like, with two little horns on top and three tears descendin', all in blue. Protection, the locals say it's for...|[[Rusty Al]]}}

==Description==
The ''Neverwinter Eye'' was a blue image of an eye with a thin-slit pupil, topped with two sets of horns, two horns on the bottom, and three tears dripping underneath. It was believed in Neverwinter that the weeping eye offered protection.

==History==
The origins of the ''Neverwinter Eye'' dated back to the tumultuous year of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, when the [[Wailing Death]] plague ravaged the Jewel of the North, immediately followed by the betrayal of the city by its paragon, [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]] and a short war with [[Luskan]] that shook the city's economy. After the plague and the war ended. The city began to rebuild, and the blue image of a weeping eye, the ''Eye & Tears'' started popping up in the city, with the locals believing it to be a symbol of protection. As such, it became a new popular design to be [[tattoo]]ed, especially by sailors and salty dogs of Neverwtiner. One tattooist parlor of note that offered ''Neverwinter Eye'' tattoos was [[Rusty Al's Tattoo & Pawn]] located in the [[Neverwinter/Docks District|Docks District]], one of the places damaged by the plague.

By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the ''Neverwinter Eye'' in white on a blue background was adopted by the [[Neverwinter Nine]] as part of their uniform. Members of the Nine wore a blue tunic adorned with the sign over their ceremonial [[armor]]. The ''Eye'' was worn by Sir [[Nevalle]], a trusted aide of Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]], and [[Darmon]], who led the city guard in the late 14{{th}} century DR. The weeping eye-decorated uniform was still in use during and several years after the war with the [[King of Shadows]] that further damaged Neverwintran economy.

The ''Neverwinter Eye'' was immortalized as a part of the monument dedicated to Nasher Alagondar that was erected in front of the [[Neverwinter arena]], adorning his [[belt]]. The Neverwinter arena was reopened in the late 1490s DR.
