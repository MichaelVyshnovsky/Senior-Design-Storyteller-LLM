Hypnosis, also known as post-hypnotic suggestion, was a minor psionic devotion of the telepathic discipline that allowed one to implant a command into another creature.
This power was described by some as being similar to the spells charm person, charm monster, or suggestion Older variants of the power allowed one to outright instruct a creature to undertake a reasonable course of action&mdashthis meant one could not instruct a creature to do things such as killing themselves or their friends&mdashas well as implant a post-hypnotic suggestion within their subconscious. This post-hypnotic suggestion had a small chance of wearing off with every proceeding day.
In later years, this minor devotion only allowed a psionicist to implant a post-hypnotic suggestion, as well as what situation would trigger the action. This suggestion likewise had to be a reasonable course of action, that being something that would not go against the creatures alignment.
Either version of this power could only affect creatures that were semi-intelligent or exceptionally intelligent. Anything less than or greater than this, creatures that were very dim or brilliant, were not susceptible. If the power back-fired on the psionicist, the victim would be made aware of the post-hypnotic suggestion.
