An '''aurora polaris''' was a captivating appearance of strange, undulating lights in the sky on cold, clear nights in the polar regions of worlds such as [[Toril]]. Near the northern poles, these were called '''northern lights'''.

==Description==
Aurorae had a wide range of shapes—curtains, halos, pillars, streaks, whisps—and a plethora of colors—usually pale green or pink but also shades of red, yellow, blue, or violet.

Aurorae usually lasted from one to six hours and provided a similar amount of light as the [[Selûne (moon)|moon]].

Learned scholars knew that the auroral displays were actually roiling regions of intense electrical energy some six to nine miles (ten to sixteen kilometers) above the surface, able to harm any creature that might be able to fly to such heights.

==Reputation==
The inhabitants of the [[divine realm]] of [[Asgard]], located on the [[Ysgard|plane]] and [[Ysgard (layer)|layer of Ysgard]] according to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], believed that an aurora polaris was a reflection of fallen warriors still fighting in the [[afterlife]]. Many travelers of the [[Deep Ethereal]] likened the appearance of [[ethereal curtain]]s to the northern lights.
