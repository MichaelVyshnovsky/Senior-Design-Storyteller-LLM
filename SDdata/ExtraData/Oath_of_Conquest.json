When they dedicated themselves to the tenets of this oath, they also were granted access to a set of spells at no cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).\nPaladins new to this oath could cast armor of Agathys, command, hold person, and spiritual weapon. Skilled bearers of such an oath could cast bestow curse, fear, dominate beast, and stoneskin. Those that had proved themselves were even able to cast cloudkill and dominate person.\nCategoryClasses\nCategoryPaladin oaths\nsal2cl5n5wmgojofmldro16sli9vtb9"
