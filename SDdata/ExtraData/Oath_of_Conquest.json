When they dedicated themselves to the tenets of this oath, they also were granted access to a set of [[spell]]s at no cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).",
        "Oath of Conquest Spells": "Paladins new to this oath could cast ''[[armor of Agathys]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', and ''[[spiritual weapon]]''. Skilled bearers of such an oath could cast ''[[bestow curse]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[dominate beast]]'', and ''[[stoneskin]]''. Those that had proved themselves were even able to cast ''[[cloudkill]]'' and ''[[dominate person]]''.",
