The Calendar of Harptos divided the thirty-day months into three blocks of ten days each, or simply put, \"tendays\". The word was used interchangeably with the Earth term \"week\".\nOther terms used synonymously with tendays included eves, domen, hyrar, and rides. As of 1367 DR, \"rides\" was the preferred term throughout Cormyr and the Dalelands.\nFollowers of the gnome deity Gaerdal Ironhand called tendays Tenhammers, after a custom of striking a metal shield with a large hammer at the end of each day and because ten days was a typical duration of guard duty for them. After ten Tenhammers, the final day was a holy day known as a Great Clang.\nCategoryChronology\nCategoryMeasurements\n623vv1ogxr2trdmyd2f5n55ntvhteyu"
