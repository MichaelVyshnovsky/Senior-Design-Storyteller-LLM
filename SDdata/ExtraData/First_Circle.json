The circle was made up of [[Auril]], [[Chauntea]], [[Eldath]], [[Malar]], [[Mielikki]], [[Silvanus]], [[Talos]], andÂ [[Umberlee]], who were considered the first among druids. Any given [[druid circle]] might worship some or all of these and most druids counted them all as worthy of veneration.<ref>"
