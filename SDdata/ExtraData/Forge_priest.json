        "mainbody": "A forge priest was a dwarf who gained special powers from keeping alive traditions of the forge.\nForge priests were charged with the traditions of the forge and blacksmithing.\nTheir traditions granted them the power to use forge chants, a special kind of cooperative spell that could be used by any dwarf, even if they were not spellcasters at all. They also gained a slight resistance to fire.\nAll forge priests had to be inducted by another forge priest in a tempering ritual, which required a vigil at a temple to Moradin. Obviously, they were all dwarves.\nIt was taboo for a forge priest to casually destroy metalwork for any reason."
