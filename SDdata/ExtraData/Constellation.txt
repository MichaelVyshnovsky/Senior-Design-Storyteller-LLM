A '''constellation''' was an arrangement of stars in [[Realmspace]] as viewed in the night sky.

==Significance==
[[Church of Mystra|Clergy]] of [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]], goddess of magic, held a regular ceremony in which they observed various stars and constellations, named them, and gave them reverence. Sometimes a ''[[silent image]]'' illusion was used to brighten stars and animate constellations, though this was a bit ostentatious. The [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]] did this every clear night in [[1374 DR]].

They had a reason to do so: alignments of constellations in the heavens above gave magical power to similar events in the world below.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City|15}}

In [[Kara-Tur]], it was believed that the [[Moon Women]] of the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] were responsible for steering the motions of the constellations along their courses.

==History==
A conjunction of certain constellations (or "heavenly signals") over Kara-Tur in {{YearlinkConvert|2311|SY}} heralded the birth of [[H'Dang Li]], future first High Lord of Oceans of [[Tabot]].<ref>

The [[Centaur (constellation)|Centaur]] and the [[Woman Warrior]] came into full alignment, their swords crossing, in the summer of the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], in the evening as [[Waterdeep]] experienced the hottest day of the year. Meanwhile, unaware, [[Timoth Eyesbright]], a heroic [[centaur]], and [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], a renowned warrior woman, had a protracted arm-wrestling contest in the [[Sel没ne's Smile]] tavern. The cosmic alignment amplified the power of their contest, which merged with [[magic]] that had sweltered in the heat and tore a mystic nexus point into a rift. This opened a door to an extra-dimensional prison, releasing [[Aviss]] and [[Fellandar]] to wreak a path of destruction in the city. [[Khelben Arunsun]] urged Vajra and Timoth to continue arm-wrestling to hold the door open, before he hurled the villains back in. Vajra and Timoth broke off, closing the rift.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City}}

A new constellation, the [[Lady of Mystery (constellation)|Lady of Mystery]], was identified after the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], following the ascension of [[Midnight]] as the new goddess Mystra, the Lady of Mysteries. The stars composing that constellation were formerly considered to be two separate constellations, the [[Dragon of Dawn (constellation)|Dragon of Dawn]] and the [[Firbolg (constellation)|Firbolg]].
