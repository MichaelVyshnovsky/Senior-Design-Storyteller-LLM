'''Animal companions''' were [[beast]]s that were magically bonded to [[ranger]]s and [[druid]]s. They helped in fighting, scouting, and friendship.

[[Beast master]] rangers and their animal companions shared a particularly strong bond. As both ranger and animal worked together as one for the same goals, some of the ranger's abilities improve the animal's natural skills, in a link that grew stronger as the ranger became more experienced.

In case of a ranger's companion's death, a new bond could be forged with a different creature over a period of 8 hours, as long as the creature was friendly towards the ranger.

Typical animal companions were no larger than a [[human]]. as was the case with the [[dwarf|dwarven]] druid [[Pikel Bouldershoulder]].
