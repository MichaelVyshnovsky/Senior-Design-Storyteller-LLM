'''Mycology''', also known as '''myconology''', was the field of study of [[fungi]]. This included sentient species of fungi, such as [[myconid]]s.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2013)/Myconology}}

==Knowledge==
Though many worked to classify fungi and determine their relations to one another, this was often the least interesting aspect of the field to mycologists. Instead, many mycologists in the Realms focused on studying fungi cultivation, fungi recipes, and varying uses for both edible and [[poison]]ous fungi.

When it came to sentient fungi, mycologists studied their breeding, their habits, and their social lives. This last aspect could include such things as migrations, territories, or even warfare. They usually hired [[adventurer]]s to make in-the-field observations for them, as sentient fungi tended to flourish in remote areas that were rife with danger from either brigands or monsters.

==History==
This field initially arose in the Realms out of a desire to determine whether or not certain species of fungi were safe for consumption.

==Notable Mycologists==
* [[Adolphus]] was skilled in medicinal applications of fungi.
* [[Balaera Chrintavimn]]
* The sage [[Imbur Andrammath]] devoted his life to mycology after his efforts to study the genealogy of [[Amn]]'s half-[[human]] [[humanoid]]s put his life in danger.{{Cite dungeon/182/Eye on the Realms: The Dracohar|67}}
* [[Visil'Taphenos]]
