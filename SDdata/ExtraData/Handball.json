        "mainbody": "andball was a general term for Faer√ªnian ball games that used a heavy leather ball and inflated bladders, propelled solely by hand instead of by feet. The game had countless local variations across the world going back through time, with no particular type becoming universally popular.\nAround the 1470s DR, the Amnian merchant house Bessail was rescued from bankruptcy by its new leader Valenti, who was inspired by his sister Tches handball hobby. He had his sailmaker Rhaal Voleau create a tough yet beautiful linen ball, creating the handball-derived sahha game, which quickly became a popular sport in Amn."
