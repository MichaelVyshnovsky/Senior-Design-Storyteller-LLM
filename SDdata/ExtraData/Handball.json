        "mainbody": "Handball''' was a general term for [[Faer√ªn]]ian ball games that used a heavy [[leather ball]] and inflated [[bladder]]s, propelled solely by hand instead of by feet. The game had countless local variations across the world going back through time, with no particular type becoming universally popular.",
        "History": "Around the 1470s [[DR]], the [[Amn]]ian merchant house [[Bessail]] was rescued from bankruptcy by its new leader [[Valenti Bessail|Valenti]], who was inspired by his sister [[Tche Bessail|Tche]]'s handball hobby. He had his sailmaker [[Rhaal Voleau]] create a tough yet beautiful [[linen]] ball, creating the handball-derived [[sahha]] game, which quickly became a popular sport in Amn."
