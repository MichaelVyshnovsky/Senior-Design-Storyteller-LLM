Somewhere underneath it all is the real worlds Carrickfergus Castle.\nThe story began with a screenplay called Chainmail, or Untitled Dungeons & Dragons Project, written by David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (Wrath of the Titans) in 2011/2012. It was named for and apparently based on the Chainmail miniatures wargame developed by Gary Gygax and Jeff Perren that was a precursor to Dungeons & Dragons. Warner Bros. executive Jon Berg had asked Johnson to develop a screenplay based on D&D, despite Warner Bros. not then having the rights. Described as an action-adventure fantasy film, Johnsons script was well received at Warner Bros. in August 2012.\nHowever, only a day later, it was reported Hasbro, owners of Wizards of the Coast and therefore D&D, were arguing the movie rights were theirs and furthermore were planning a movie with Universal Studios, directed by Chris Morgan (writer of the Fast & Furious franchise and 47 Ronin). They subsequently developed a script, titled Forgotten Realms Dungeons & Dragons, its logline \"Kept under wraps.\" by March 24, 2014. This was the first connection of either movie to the Forgotten Realms setting.\nThere followed much complicated legal wrangling beyond the scope of a D&D wiki, but it did depend on whether The Book of Vile Darkness was a sequel to the previous Dungeons & Dragons and Wrath of the Dragon God movies. They, and D&D fandom, will never know the answer to that question as, following a six-day trial in September 2014, Hasbro, Warner Bros., and Sweetpea settled out of court on the rights to a D&D movie. On August 3, 2015, it was reported they planned to make the D&D movie together, continuing the Warner Bros. project with the involvement of Hasbros chief executive Brian Goldner and chief content officer Stephen Davis as producers. According to Greg Silverman, president of creative development and worldwide production at Warner Bros., \"We are so excited about bringing the world of Dungeons & Dragons to life on the big screen. This is far and away the most well-known brand in fantasy, which is the genre that drives the most passionate film followings. D&D has endless creative possibilities, giving our filmmakers immense opportunities to delight and thrill both fans and moviegoers new to the property.\" Still using Johnsons Chainmail script, it was said to be set in the Forgotten Realms. In an interview with Collider at DICE 2016, Roy Lee suggested the Warner Bros. movie would be an ensemble picture, with a group of main characters, and have an adventurous feel, commenting \"This new Dungeons & Dragons will be a Guardians of the Galaxy–tone movie in a Tolkien-like universe. Because when you think of all the Hobbit movies and The Lord of the Rings, they have an earnestness to them, and to see something fun, a Raiders romp inside that world, I feel is something the audience has not seen before.\" Of Warner Bros., he said \"I believe they see Dungeons & Dragons as something that could be cultivated as a multi-universe movie where there will be spinoffs from the first movie being in Forgotten Realms and subsequent movies being in different worlds.\" He also promised it would go deep into the source material and that the writer and others were all long-term D&D fans \"everyone whos involved with it now, especially the writer of the first draft is a fan from the very beginning starting with Chainmail, which turned into Dungeons & Dragons, so youll see things that are very faithful to the source material as well as new elements are being incorporated with help from Wizards of the Coast, who are giving a lot of input on the script.\" He revealed the movie would be entirely set within the Forgotten Realms, with the Yawning Portal Inn being a prominent feature and set piece of the movie.\nOn March 31, 2016, Rob Letterman (Gullivers Travels, Goosebumps) was confirmed to direct the D&D movie after a successful presentation to executives. Meanwhile, producers were rumored to be looking for an actor like Vin Diesel, a well-known D&D fan. Dwayne Johnson was also in discussions to star at some point.\nHowever, a year and a half later, on December 18, 2017, Warner Bros. confirmed it was no longer developing a Dungeons & Dragons movie, while Paramount Pictures suddenly announced their own, to be released on July 23, 2021. This was alongside other movies based on other Hasbro properties, as part of a shared universe with Hasbros Allspark Pictures.\nOn February 20, 2018, Chris McKay (director of The Lego Batman Movie) was reported to be in negotiations to direct the Dungeons & Dragons movie. Davis, Goldner, Lee, Solomon, and Zeman were all still producing. Michael Gilio was apparently rewriting Johnsons script. On March 8, 2018, Paramount was reportedly considering filming in the United Kingdom. It was reported on November 2, 2018, that principal photography would begin in summer of 2019. Furthermore, [https//www.imdb.com/name/nm1476226/ Shari Hanson] (a visual effects producer for many Paramount movies) was added as a producer.\nOn March 12, 2019, it was reported Gilio had submitted a new script and Paramount was so satisfied that, while final revisions were being made, they would begin looking for a new lead male actor from a shortlist of A-listers, naming Dave Bautista, Josh Brolin, Johnny Depp, Vin Diesel, Joel Edgerton, Jamie Foxx, Matthew McConaughey, Chris Pratt, Jeremy Renner and Will Smith.\nHowever, Chris McKay moved on to another movie and by July 30, 2019, was replaced as director by Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley (directors of Game Night and co-writers of Spider-Man Homecoming). Daley learned to play D&D while playing a geek character in Freaks and Geeks. In a later interview with FANDOM, Daley said \"Im an avid player... its set in a fictional world that our DM created, but it definitely utilizes a lot of the creatures and monsters from the manual.\" and \"I also play a video game with my son Dungeons & Dragons Tower of Doom and Shadow over Mystara... its a nice bonding moment for us. So its very much in my DNA at this point.\" He added \"Im a half-elf paladin, and Ive been that for the last five years.\" His characters name is mentioned in the movie \"That was the most exciting moment for me, not seeing my name on the screen but hearing my character.\" but noted \"hes not representative of the character that I created for myself, it was really just a name check.\"\nTwo days later, a source told wegotthiscovered.com that Goldstein and Daley were trying to get Zac Efron to play an important character named Malanthius, a big but not leading role.\nEventually, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic causing studio closures, filming delays, and difficulties, on April 24, 2020, the movie was delayed from November 19, 2021, to May 27, 2022, putting it in the middle of blockbuster movie season. By now, Goldstein and Daley had taken over scriptwriting. By May 7, 2020, [https//www.imdb.com/name/nm1436246/ Jeremy Latcham], a producer of several movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, had signed on with Hasbros Entertainment One (eOne) studio and would work on the Dungeons & Dragons movie. On May 28, 2020, The Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Goldstein and Daley, in which they discussed how the pandemic lockdown affected their plans for the D&D movie, among other things. Their plans to scout locations in the United Kingdom in March were curtailed by the shutdown of travel, and they wrote the second draft while in isolation, while large crowd scenes were being reconsidered. Goldstein said \"We want it to be fun. Its not an out-and-out comedy, but it is an action-fantasy movie with a lot of comedic elements and characters we hope people will really get into and enjoy watching their adventures.\" while Daley said \"D&D is such a unique look at the fantasy genre where it is contemporary in terms of the people playing it and the way they speak to each other. So we never wanted to spoof the genre of fantasy or take the piss out of it. But we did want to find another way into it that we hadnt necessarily seen before. Just the format of Dungeons & Dragons is so interesting and fun and all about critical thinking and thinking on your feet and figuring out ways to make things work after they fall flat. Theres a lot of the spirit of that that were trying to inject into the movie itself.\"\nthumb|right|250px|Concept art of a snowy owlbear (artist unknown).\nthumb|right|250px|Concept art of a journey through Icewind Dale (artist unknown).\nConcept art was provided in 2020 by [https//www.linkedin.com/in/lucanemolato/ Luca Nemolato] over March to May and by [https//www.linkedin.com/in/paul-gerrard-4b10611/ Paul Gerrard] over July to October. Gerrard later wrote \"I had to fight to get on the D&D movie. Not because of my ideas but my style. The known generalisation of my style was dark, monochrome, evil! The Director wanted colourful, fun, vibrant so the Production Designer had to push my work. It was a hard sell but he had faith in me. Each day he would say more colour, more character and so on. So I came up with a process to train myself... It worked!\"\nCinematographer Barry Peterson announced on Instagram on August 23, 2020 \"D&D coming soon.\" and confirmed filming in Ireland, while sharing an image of a dragons eye. This is a recolored and cropped version of a [https//wallpaperaccess.com/cool-dragon-eyes widely available desktop wallpaper image], suggesting it is a mock-up if nothing else.\nOn April 4, 2021, Paramount announced delays for ten of its movies, including the D&D movie, which was pushed back from May 27, 2022, to March 3, 2023.\nThe visual special effects and animation are handled by [https//www.ilm.com/ Industrial Light & Magic (ILM)], famous for Star Wars and many Marvel comics movies and series, and by the [https//www.mpcvfx.com/ Moving Picture Company (MPC)], a VFX studio involved in countless movies and series, including The Witcher and The Wheel of Time in the fantasy genre. In 2021, MPC began hiring for the Untitled Dungeons & Dragons movie, calling for \"a fire breathing FX demon or an Animation wizard\" and \"a CG Supervisor that maxes out in (STR), (DEX), (CON), (INT) and (WIS).\" Many creatures would be handled by animatronics. Hugh Grant later recalled, \"Just when you thought you were doing a rather powerful or amusing little bit of acting, youd realise there was a fucking dragon walking past you in the background, stealing your thunder. There was a lot of incredibly intricate, I dont know what you call it... Animatronics! Terrifying. A fish that eats babies! And suddenly the whole floor of the set would be quicksand! I wish Id had my children with me. They would have liked that.\"\nthumb|right|250px|A storyboard for Dorics owlbear wild shape and fight scene.\nthumb|right|250px|Part of a storyboard for Holgas battle with the mimic.\nTo integrate the storyline with the lore of D&D and the Forgotten Realms during writing and production, Goldstein and Daley had the involvement of Wizards of the Coast representatives Nathan Stewart, Head of Franchise and VP of Global Brand Marketing & Strategy, and Jeremy Crawford, Principal Designer for D&D. Goldstein said in the interview with FANDOM, \"Wizards of the Coast generally were involved very much throughout the process in the writing stage and on set, and we would consult them with any questions we had, any issues we had. And they were really helpful because—it wasnt in the spirit of you cant do that, it was let us help you figure out how you can do that in the world weve created. Latcham added \"Yeah, and Nathan and Jeremy at Wizards were just like tremendously helpful and still are.\" and gave an example of ensuring accuracy in a map presented in the film, adding \"Because some things youre looking for authenticity and some things youre looking for accuracy and I think in that case accuracy would be appreciated... Its usually like how do we do this inside the world and make it right, and then sometimes its like how do we make the movie exist in the world more specifically and so, its really fun.\" Daley said \"We actually went up to Wizards of the Coast headquarters in Seattle and did a crash course in some of the lesser-known aspects of the game and it was wildly helpful and we ended up incorporating a ton of stuff in the movie just from that meeting.\" They also had assistance from Ashley Alexander, Senior Director of Film Development & Sales at eOne and a producing partney Daley said she \"is like a bonafide D&D nerd who knows way more than i do about it and she was an invaluable resource.\" They also made use of D&D Beyond, with Latcham saying \"We all had all-the-time access to D&D Beyond so its just like okay, hold on, hold on, no thats not right, and the actor is like whats happening? and were well get back to you in one second, we have to work something out.\" But most importantly, when asked \"How much did you use the Forgotten Realms Wiki for research, Daley answered \"A ton, a ton! ...Honestly, sometimes on-set.\"\nChris Pine (Star Trek, Wonder Woman) was reported on December 14 to be in negotiations to star. The next week, the site Illuminerdi claimed an exclusive report, giving details about Chris Pines character, called Edgin.\nBy February 8, 2021, Michelle Rodriguez (Fast & Furious and Resident Evil franchises among others) and Justice Smith (Detective Pikachu and Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom), had closed deals to star in the movie, while Chris Pine was confirmed. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Rodriguez revealed her role as a barbarian \"You know what, Im gonna be a barbarian in this one. And so, you know, Ive just been training. Ive been— lots of protein, oh my god, and Im hoping to gain the weight necessary to just be able to carry an axe appropriately. So Im in the mix with Chris, Chris Pine, I cant wait to work with him. Ive always heard nothing but great things about this guy. And were about to be in Ireland, man, you know, in the bubble.\" The bubble is coronavirus precautions, with testing three times a week.\nRegé-Jean Page (Bridgerton, Mortal Engines) was added a week later. In an interview with Variety in May, 2021, Page explained he wasnt a D&D player but said \"Ive listened to a couple of Dungeons and Dragons podcasts in my time. I played a ton of JRPGs and basically everything thats come out of it. I played a ton of Diablo as a teenager, so Im used to the fact that I play a paladin—thats just what I do, and I know what that means, to a degree. I watched my friends play Baldurs Gate, so Im like a second-generation Dungeons and Dragoner.\" He recruited friends to teach him about D&D, adding \"There is nowhere better or bigger to learn new worlds from than D&D.\" He said he was attracted by the Dungeons & Dragons movie script, observing it had stepped up and raised the bar for fantasy movies and would be a \"huge sigh of relief for Dungeons & Dragons fans everywhere.\" Goldstein mentioned Pages role \"allows him to show a full spectrum of his talent\" and \"He naturally exudes a sense of dignity and heroism that is fitting for the fantasy genre, and is perfect for the role we cast him in.\"\nHugh Grant, star of countless films, and Sophia Lillis (It, I Am Not Okay With This) were later reported to have joined by March 2. Grant was stated to be playing a villainous role. Various news sites added the rumor that Grants character would be named \"Forge Fletcher\" and Lilliss \"Doric\", but the basis for this is unknown. In an interview with Screen Daily published on June 24, Grant said he hadnt played Dungeons & Dragons before but the movie, as a \"great big, expensive Hollywood blockbuster\" offered the chance to do something different and said \"But more than that I laughed at the script. Its hard to please me, but it had real charm and moved me. I was certainly not expecting that.\" He could neither confirm nor deny reports that hed be playing the villain.\n[https//www.imdb.com/name/nm5668548/ Chloe Coleman] (My Spy, Avatar 2) was added to the cast by April 21. Jason Wong (The Gentlemen) was reported on May 13 to be playing a character called Drallas (also reported as Dralas). Earlier, on May 1, he posted a video on Instagram of himself having a full head cast made, likely for a mask for his role. A week later, Daisy Head (Shadow and Bone) was reported to have joined the cast.\nDexter Fletcher (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Rocketman) revealed in an interview with Alex Zane of the Just the Facts podcast, released June 2, that he had a small role in the Dungeons & Dragons movie \"I just did Dungeons & Dragons as well... I only did it the other day as a favor, for a mate... Marlamin, hes called. I am Michelle Rodriguezs ex-husband... I think Im a goodie. Its hard for me to say, because Ive got one scene where she comes and sees me, in my little house. Im really diminutive, Ive got a very tall wife... They gave me one scene, I dont know what thats about... They were like Can you come and do this one scene, itll just be really lovely. ...I had a big beard.\" His character would be replaced with a cameo of Bradley Cooper, however.\nAnd a dog Antilly, a German Shepherd from Stunt Dogs and Animals, (After Life and Treason) appears in some scenes, it was later reported. \"Shes got loads of stuff coming up, shes going to be in the new Dungeons and Dragons—we went to Northern Ireland to film that last summer.\" said her handler. However, these dog scenes were apparently cut.\nAhead of shooting, the main cast played a campaign of D&D together to get familiar with the game and each other.\nthumb|250px|Equipment and clapperboard for the first take.\nthumb|right|250px|Blue screen, new castle, and snow, in front of old Kings Landing Gates at Titanic Studios.\nFilming was planned to begin in the first quarter of 2021, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, However, the first filming took place in South Iceland, supervised by Truenorth Productions, as reported on April 7. Some 60–70 people were involved, using Icelandic stand-ins for the main cast who couldnt attend due to pandemic restrictions, and 15 visitors from overseas. By a fortunate coincidence, the Fagradalsfjall volcano had begun erupting on March 19, with the first lava flow in the area for 6000 years. The production team used the opportunity to film scenes with it as a backdrop.\nOn the first day of production, rather than rehearsing, the cast and directors played a game of D&D together. Daley would recall, \"The first day, rather than using our precious time to rehearse, we decided to play a three-plus hour game. The Wizards of the Coast were nice enough to give us a Dungeon Master on Zoom and we played. And it was hilarious and really educational, because I think they all learned about their characters more, and I think we incorporated some of the things that came out of that.\"\nWith the main cast, filming proper began in Belfast on April 29, with Goldstein posting a picture of the movie clapperboard for the first scene on Twitter on May 1, announcing \"The campaign begins. #DnD\", and Barry Peterson posting the same on Instagram with \"Our adventure begins.\" Photographs of Titanic Studios taken around May 15–17 showed parts of the old Kings Landing sets for Game of Thrones were rebuilt and others retained, with a new dark stone structure, artificial snow, and a blue screen added, seemingly for Dungeons & Dragons, though there may be some overlap with the GoT prequel House of the Dragon. Castle Street in Glenarm was closed for filming of Dungeons & Dragons from May 26.\nthumb|right|250px|Setting up for location filming on the coast near Ballintoy on May 14.\nFilming began in the village of Ballintoy, Northern Ireland, on May 14 it had also been a location for Game of Thrones. Images of location filming being set up on the coast nearby appeared thereafter.\nFilming was scheduled to take place around Wells Cathedral and Wells, Somerset, in England on June 2–5 and 8–12. Filming proper started on June 10, with first images showing Chloe Coleman and other actors in costume. Michelle Rodriguez was sighted half in costume a day or so later, and Hugh Grant shortly after.\nthumb|right|250px|A gate house at Alnwick Castle with new banners reading The Highsun Games in Thorass.\nRumors also had filming scheduled to occur at Alnwick Castle (a location used for several movies) in Alnwick, Northumberland, with preparations going back to May 26th and the castle closed for a \"private event\" over June 7–12. Photos on June 4 showed the castle being embellished with fake lion-topped plinths and garden features, tracks being erased, tents outside and a market inside for the Dungeons & Dragons movie. The first images of filming at and around Alnwick Castle appeared on June 7 and 8, showing the castle hung with banners, some displaying the blue three-snowflakes symbol of Neverwinter, confirming at least some of the movie is set there, and the same symbol in yellow and orange within a sun. Later images showed these sun banners removed. Other images showed warriors in armor and head tattoos, a boat on a river, artificial smoke or mist, a collection of tents outside and a small market inside, and extras dressed as knights, peasants, nobles, and merchants (see Gallery, below). Images of filming at Wells Cathedral from June 10 showed Chloe Coleman, Michelle Rodriguez, and Hugh Grant in costume, and similar knights and noble characters in medieval dress.\nFrom around June 24, posts on social media reported film crew trailers and stages being set up at Carrickfergus Castle, in the castle, car park, and harbor. This was dressed as a docks with boats and stacks of cargo and the castle entrance was given false stonework. Images appeared on social media of medieval armored boats and paraphernalia, as well as Sophia Lillis in dressing gown and medieval boots hidden behind an umbrella. Friend of the FRW [https//twitter.com/HibernoWay Gerald Clarke of Hibernoway] later visited the castle and found it fenced off, and took pictures and a [https//twitter.com/HibernoWay/status/1408761295319535619 video] from the scene. On June 26, Michelle Rodriguez was seen arriving on set in costume, mask and dressing gown. On June 28, Chris Pine and Hugh Grant were seen at the castle in costume, with a glimpse of horned character who might be Sophia Lillis. The following day, Justice Smith, Chloe Coleman, and Sophia Lillis, as well as Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez, were all seen on set and joking together. June 30 was reportedly the final day of location filming at Carrickfergus with the actors, though more filming with stuntwork was expected.\nA few prominent boats were seen at Carrickfergus Castle. The most notable is a large black-hulled vessel covered over with spiked armored plates, with a single mast with dark-blue sails, and a battering ram ending in a copper dragon head, colored to resemble old copper. It resembles a Korean geobukseon (or turtle ship). Coleman, Lillis, Pine, Rodriguez, and Smith appeared have scenes on board. It would later feature prominently on a screen behind Daley and Goldstein in their D&D Direct video\nthumb|right|250px|Cast and crew working out a scene...\nthumb|right|250px|...and how it turned out.\nAgain from social media, the next sites for location filming are apparently the abandoned village of [https//www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-hidden-village-of-galboly Galboly] (previously a Game of Thrones site) and [https//discovernorthernireland.com/accommodation/fallowvee-p684001 Fallowvee Cottage]. Visitors reported Galboly to be fenced off by June 27 for a few weeks for filming of Dungeons & Dragons, starting July 7. Nearby Glen Road in Glenariffe was closed for filming of Dungeons & Dragons from June 29. This site was confirmed on July 8 when Barry Peterson posted an image from near Fallowvee on Instagram. Aerial photos on July 11 showed the cottage set built for Game of Thrones had been remodeled with new door-frame pillars and door, windows, added thatch and moss on the roof, and a chimney, with gardens or farms under construction. A week later, people were again able to visit Galboly, and took close-up pictures of the remodeled cottage.\nOn July 31 and August 1, the dragon-headed boat was seen sailing on Lough Neagh, a lake in Northern Ireland, presumably for filming. It was accompanied by safety boats and a helicopter.\nFilming for Hugh Grant and Regé-Jean Page wrapped on August 8. This was reported soon after on Twitter by Jonathan Goldstein, who said \"and damn are they good in this movie.\" Photos of Titanic Studios tweeted on November 16 showed the D&D movie set occupying the former Kings Landing street set, with a market scene and the sun symbol banners appearing once more.\nFilming overall wrapped on August 19, as reported on Twitter by John Francis Daley. Barry Peterson posted a group shot of the lighting crew at Titanic Studios to Instagram around August 22, declaring \"Thats a wrap on Dungeons & Dragons.\" On February 3, he posted a behind-the-scenes image of lighting control screens and cranes, teasing \"D&D whats behind the curtain.\"\nNevertheless, shooting with extras would continue as late as March 2022.\nIn an interview with Collider on September 9, Justice Smith said of the Dungeons & Dragons movie \"[Goldstein and Daley are] incredible. Theyre so funny and they have such clear vision. I loved Game Night. That movie is so good and so funny. And its such a clear, specific story. It doesnt try and be anything that its not. I think they approached this the same way. I cant spoil too much but its action-packed, thrilling, funny as hell… its all of the things and yet it has a clear idea. That specificity is key in storytelling and John and Jonathan do that so well, being like, \"This is the story were telling but theyre making it enjoyable the entire time.\" This is me not trying to spoil the movie in any regards. Ive given away no details.\"\nChris Pine, when asked about the movie in an interview with Collider published on March 18, 2022, said \"Well, what I will say is we had a hell of a fun time making it. There was a lot of laughs. The way that Ive been describing it, its like Game of Thrones mixed with a little Princess Bride, just a smidge of Holy Grail its somewhere in that ballpark. Its a lot of fun. Its got a lot of thrills. Its poppy, its eighties heartfelt, theres a bit of Goonies in there. My character, hes the ultimate party planner. I think its going to be really good. I mean, who —ing knows, but I think we got a good shot and John and John are killer guys. They know comedy and they know heart and we had a great cast and we had a good time making it. And thats all you can ask for.\"\nHasbros 2022 Ignite/Innovation Showcase for investors and retailers on March 26, 2022, briefly mentioned the D&D movie. Jenny Whitlock, VP of Global Franchise Strategy & Management, said \"Turning to Wizards other iconic brand, Dungeons & Dragons, get ready to embark on a new adventure next spring, with an epic cinematic event. Releasing only in theaters March 3rd, 2023, this live-action feature film stars an impressive roster of talent and will introduce audiences around the world to this legendary and expansive story universe.\"\nthumb|right|250px|Daley and Goldstein introducing the movie, behind the first look at Carrickfergus Castle Neverwinter!\nThe D&D Direct online event on April 22, 2022, viewable [https//youtu.be/FMHspJ92-hg?t=1019 here], had a teaser video revealing the full logo and title of the movie Dungeons & Dragons Honor Among Thieves. Daley and Goldstein together said \"Hi, Im John Francis Daley, and Im Jonathan Goldstein. After years of being devoted players, we, like you, have been spent a lot of time imagining the incredible places, characters, and limitless adventure that D&D offers. We could not be more excited to bring this world to the big screen. We just wrapped shooting in some of the most incredible locations. Its a dream come true to bring the Forgotten Realms and the Sword Coast to life. We set out to capture the spirit of fun and surprise that we all love about D&D. Thank you to our awesome partners at Wizards of the Coast, but most importantly thank you to you, the greatest fans in the world. Its going to be in theaters March 2023. We cant wait for you to see it.\" They appeared in front of a screen showing a city, likely Neverwinter, and the armored boat seen in location photos.\nAt CinemaCon 2022, Paramounted previewed a private sizzle reel for cinema executives and convention goes including scenes from Honor Among Thieves, about 30 seconds in total. Press described it as having \"the production quality of a top-notched historical epic\" with \"lush landscape locations\" and \"large, beautiful vistas\", with \"a fun, action packed vibe\".\nAt San Diego Comic-Con 2022, a special display titled the Dungeons & Dragons Honor Among Thieves Tavern Experience took visitors around a mock dungeon and tavern, with models of a gelatinous cube, beholder, mimic, and a displacer beast, and video of a black dragon. Promotional videos depicted Grant, Pine, Smith, Rodriguez, Lillis, and Page in costume and performing poses, accompanied by 5-edition class icons that indicate their characters classes. Movie posters depicting various monsters were seen, but used recycled artworks and even an intellect devourer from the Pathfinder system these were made by [https//twitter.com/Bosslogic/status/1550303553050136576 BossLogic specifically for SDCC using provided resources]. Much news poured out on the 21 and 22 July. Actors were available for meetings with press IGN interviewed Lillis and Rodriguez about their characters and experience with D&D\n and Entertainment Weekly interviewed the main cast, producer, and directors, revealing final character names and details. A great deal of information came out to the press and audience in a panel, with behind-the-scenes footage and additional clips from the movie, depicting a scene of interrogating slain soldiers via speak with dead to find the location of a magical helmet and an extended arena battle scene, with reports of a homage to the Dungeons & Dragons cartoon series in the form of rival adventurers. The first trailer, seen [https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiMinixSXII here], was also unveiled at the convention, along with an official synopsis. The soundtrack was \"Whole Lotta Love\" by Led Zeppelin. Christopher Perkins and Todd Kenreck discussed various things seen in it another video, [https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGIdeBc4Uyw here], confirming various plot details, such as Dorics tiefling race and the Revels End prison being created to link with the movie. FANDOMs Emma Fyffe and Kylara also interviewed Latcham, Goldstein, and Daley, using a few questions submitted by the FRW editors responses to these are above.\nA behind-the-scenes featurette titled [https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5y1pRPXPHE An Epic Journey] was released by Paramount on December 5, 2022. It has brief interviews with cast and crew, as well as new clips from the movie, revealing more character moments and creatures.\n A second movie poster was released, but received some criticism for its random-cluster-of-bodies composition, being typical of many movie posters, particularly Marvel superhero movies.

Daley \"This is not Jumanji. We talked about it, but we made a decision that we did not want to break the fourth wall. Theres so much fun to be had just in the world of D&D that we didnt have to bring it into our world and show kids playing.\" Goldstein \"We felt, in fact, that it would be sort of limiting the absolute scope of this world if we were to sort of put it through the lens of a game being played.\" On adherence to D&D rules, Goldstein also noted \"We definitely played by the rule of cool when it came to how much we adhere to the game mechanics. Very often, I think we do have a lot of turn-based action. And all the spells and monsters and creatures that they come across are authentic to the lore, but we definitely took some liberties to give you the most action-packed fun that we could.\" IGN also displayed [https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtGgsyI99Rw an exclusive clip] showing the speak with dead scene.\nThe official \"Dungeons & Dragons Movie\" twitter [unavailable now] reportedhttps//www.enworld.org/threads/update-new-theaters-added-see-the-d-d-movie-wednesday-and-get-a-faerun-cloth-map.696741/ early access fan event screenings would give away a limited-edition cloth map of Neverwinter branded with the logo of the movie.\nAs to the story itself, various versions have been reported or rumored. A preregistered copyright filed with the United States Copyright Office on May 12, 2021, gave a brief précis of the plot\nThis was subsequently reported to be \"not accurate\", according to unnamed sources and confirmations. Darryl Mott of Enworld offered more cogent reasons for this as a placeholder description for copyright preregistration, it does not need to be official and may be an earlier or falsified version to prevent spoilers. In any case, every element of this would be borne out by later news and trailers, suggesting it was, in fact, entirely correct all along and it was the press who were not accurate.\nA Wizards of the Coast press release on May 21, 2021, confirmed the Paramount movie is set in the Forgotten Realms and that its not focused on Drizzt DoUrden. In D&D Direct in 2022, Daley and Goldstein mentioned it would be set in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms.\nMichael Lombardo, President of Global Television for Hasbros Entertainment One, in an interview with Deadline published on November 22, 2021, discussed the Dungeons & Dragons series then in development and noted \"We have a big movie thats in post right now that will come out first so, were trying to also navigate the brand more holistically so that the movie feels not apart from but connected somehow to a bigger universe.\" Discussing the series, pitch writer Derek Kolstad mentioned certain canon characters are off limits, given shifting copyrights with the Dungeons & Dragons movie, implying the movie will include some existing canon characters.\nthumb|right|Regrettably, all we can show you is this boar.\nthumb|right|Oh, alright, and this boar-head shield.\nthumb|right|And now Gwaeron Windstrom.\nIn early May, 2022, Forgotten Realms Wiki editors conducted independent research and discovered clues revealing scenes set in the town of Triboar, but are not at liberty to share the full evidence. Images of a battle with three boars, ornamental shields bearing three boar heads, processions of warriors, and a depiction of the god Gwaeron Windstrom all point to Triboar. This was the Triboar playhouse see in Honor Among Thieves.\nIn addition, the banners at Alnwick Castle were found to display letters in the Thorass alphabet. Though jumbled, they read The Highsun Games or The High Sun Games, referring to the arena battle held in Neverwinter at the end of the movie.\nIn late July, 2022, following the trailer release, Forgotten Realms Wiki editors discovered a leaked fragment of the Honor Among Thieves script dated to late 2020. Character names and story details were confirmed by the trailer, official synopsis, character details, novelization, and eventually the movie itself. It is presented at ForumHonor Among Thieves script leak it contains minor spoilers.\nthumb|right|250px|The first screening probably wont go like this.\nWith many prior incarnations of the script, there has been a variety of rumored storylines for the movie. On movie-industry spec script resource The Tracking Board, the logline given for the original Chainmail script on September 18, 2012, read\nThis would expand slightly over time, with the logline for Dungeons & Dragons on August 3, 2015, (after the Hasbro/Warner Bros. partnership on the movie) reading\nIndustry publication [https//www.productionweekly.com/ Production Weekly] gave a similar description as late as April 8, 2021\nThis aligns closely with the following rumors and reports, but may also be out-of-date or falsified as this version dates back to the original Johnson-McGoldrick Chainmail script for Warner Bros., before the Gilio rewrite for Paramount. It is unknown what, if anything, remains of the original storyline Johnson-McGoldricks name is no longer attached, only Gilios, but the Chainmail working title is retained. Furthermore, the Universal Forgotten Realms Dungeons & Dragons may have been used instead or merged with Chainmail. Nevertheless, this description was updated to include Chris Pine and the Edgin character, who presumably replaces Raven Hightower.\nOn June 27, 2016, [http//www.aintitcool.com/node/75566 Harry Knowles of Aint It Cool News] claimed to have seen Johnson-McGoldricks first draft of the script.
