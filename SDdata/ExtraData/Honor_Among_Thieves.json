Comicbook.com added that they are \"looking for the [[Eye of Vecna]]\".\n\nCharacters previously reported, possibly for earlier scripts, are:\n* Raven Hightower, a warrior with a magical flaming sword and wearing leather armor and oiled cloak. He has long hair, a beard, and dark sunken eyes. He and his sister were once slaves, possibly of Razer Horlbar. He is an honorable man but haunted by his sister's death. He explores \"the Demon Temples\" alongside Zanril and Karroway. A leading male role in 88 scenes. (Possibly replaced by Edgin.)\n*Hack Karroway, a [[half-dragon]] and former [[human]]. He can breathe fire, wielded a large bastard sword and wears armor. He is 7 feet tall and has a long tail, and blood-red scales. He is logical and intelligent. He explores \"the Demon Temples\" alongside Hightower and Zanril. A leading male role in 77 scenes played via voice-over.\n*Otivan Trickfoot or Olivan Trickfoot, a [[gnome]] thief. He is cunning and untrustworthy. He wears magical rings. A strong supporting male role in 51 scenes.\n*Alyssa Steelsong, the leader of \"the masked warriors\" and set to take Palarandusk's place as Lord Protector of the Triadic Knights after his death. She uses a mace. A strong supporting female role in 41 scenes.\n*Malanthius, a spellcaster. He is young, slender, and has long hair. A potential ally of the main characters; an important but not leading role. A strong supporting male role in 26 scenes. (This character has a very similar name and occupation as the [[Magister]] [[Malanthus Stormstaern]].)\n*Palarandusk, an ancient [[gold dragon]] and Lord Protector of a group of Triadic Knights. He has catfish-like whiskers and his scales are cracked and spines dangling. He eats gemstones. A supporting male role in 3 scenes. Palarandusk is a gold dragon known to be a protector of Neverwinter and [[Ieirithymbul]]), while \"Lord Protector\" is a title for leaders of Neverwinter like [[Dagult Neverember]]. Palarandusk, with his original title as the Unseen Protector, is confirmed to appear in the final movie by the [https://www.amazon.com/NERF-MicroShots-Dungeons-Dragons-Palarandusk/dp/B0B1VVXMGB/ NERF MicroShots Dungeons & Dragons Palarandusk Blaster].\n*Razer Horlbar, an [[elf]] and leader of \"the cloaked men\", including Damaia and The Beast. He is the main villain and once enslaved Raven and his sister. He is handsome, has jet-black skin, long white hair, and pointed ears. A supporting male role in 14 scenes. (Presumably he is a [[drow]] and a member of [[House Horlbar]].)\n*Damaia or Damala, a [[tiefling]] descended from demons who has horns, a long tail, and pointed teeth. A supporting female role in 10 scenes. (\"Damaia\" is a suggested female tiefling name in ''[[Player's Handbook 4th edition]]'' and ''[[Player's Handbook 5th edition]]''.)\n*The Beast, a brutish warrior. He is huge and wears a cloak and a blank wooden mask. A supporting male role in 9 scenes.\n*Bickety, a human swordsman and adventurer with a scarred face. A supporting male role in 9 scenes.\n*Zanril, a warlock adventurer. He's bald. He explores \"the Demon Temples\" alongside Hightower and Karroway. A supporting male role in 9 scenes.\n*Skeever, a [[half-orc]] adventurer. A supporting male role in 7 scenes.",

So we never wanted to spoof the genre of fantasy or take the piss out of it. But we did want to find another way into it that we hadn't necessarily seen before.

Very often, I think we do have a lot of turn-based action.

On movie-industry spec script resource The Tracking Board, the logline given for the original ''Chainmail'' script on September 18, 2012, read:\n{{quote|Centers on a warrior and his band of mystical creatures who embark on a dangerous journey to find a mythical treasure.}}\nThis would expand slightly over time, with the logline for ''Dungeons & Dragons'' on August 3, 2015, (after the Hasbro/Warner Bros. partnership on the movie) reading:\n{{quote|Based on the iconic game, a warrior and his band of mystical creatures – including a half-dragon and a cunning gnome – embark on a dangerous journey to find a mythical treasure.}}\nIndustry publication [https://www.productionweekly.com/ Production Weekly] gave a similar description as late as April 8, 2021:\n{{quote|The action-adventure tale centers on Edgin (Pine) a warrior and his band of mystical creatures – including a half-dragon and a cunning gnome – as they embark on a dangerous journey to find a mythical treasure.}}\nThis aligns closely with the following rumors and reports, but may also be out-of-date or falsified as this version dates back to the original Johnson-McGoldrick ''Chainmail'' script for Warner Bros., before the Gilio rewrite for Paramount. It is unknown what, if anything, remains of the original storyline; Johnson-McGoldrick's name is no longer attached, only Gilio's, but the ''Chainmail'' working title is retained. Furthermore, the Universal ''Forgotten Realms: Dungeons & Dragons'' may have been used instead or merged with ''Chainmail''. Nevertheless, this description was updated to include Chris Pine and the Edgin character, who presumably replaces Raven Hightower.\n\nOn June 27, 2016, [http://www.aintitcool.com/node/75566 Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News] claimed to have seen Johnson-McGoldrick's first draft of the script. Apparently named ''Dungeons & Dragons: The Hand of Chaos'', it is an \"Object Quest style D&D story\", described as more like ''Indiana Jones'' than ''Warcraft'', with \"competitors and traitors and all manners of magic and monsters and Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson inspired awesomery throughout.\" Characters include Raven Hightower, played by Ansel Elgort; a gnome cutpurse, a bald [[warlock]], and a half-dragon, possibly fighting a [[gnoll]] at some point.{{cite web\n| url            = http://www.aintitcool.com/node/75566\n| title          = Ansel Elgort draws a magical flamesword for DUNGEONS & DRAGONS: THE HAND OF CHAOS!!!\n| accessdate     = 2016-07-01\n| author         = Harry Knowles\n| date           = 2016-06-27\n| archiveurl     = https://web.archive.org/web/20201030000033/http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/75566\n| archivedate    = 2020-10-30\n}} (Incidentally, ''The Hand of Chaos'' shares a name with [[Wikipedia:The Hand of Chaos|a non-D&D fantasy novel]] by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, noted writers of the ''Dragonlance'' D&D setting.)\n\nOn November 27, 2019, both [https://fandomwire.com/exclusive-dungeons-dragons-character-details-revealed/ FandomWire] and [https://comicbook.com/gaming/2019/11/27/dungeons-and-dragons-movie-forgotten-realms-eye-of-vecna/ Comicbook.com] claimed exclusive reports from sources on the Paramount movie's plot and characters, giving details that tallied with the earlier reports about the Warner Bros. project, with FandomWire giving much more detail and the two differing in some spellings.{{cite web\n| url            = https://comicbook.com/gaming/2019/11/27/dungeons-and-dragons-movie-forgotten-realms-eye-of-vecna/\n| title          = Dungeons & Dragons Movie to Focus on the Eye of Vecna, Will Feature a Forgotten Realms Character\n| accessdate     = 2019-11-27\n| author         = Christian Hoffer\n| date           = 2019-11-27\n| archiveurl     = https://web.archive.org/web/20200517101024/https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/dungeons-and-dragons-movie-forgotten-realms-eye-of-vecna/\n| archivedate    = 2020-05-17\n}}{{cite web\n| url            = https://fandomwire.com/exclusive-dungeons-dragons-character-details-revealed/\n| title          = EXCLUSIVE: ‘Dungeons & Dragons’ Character Details Revealed\n| accessdate     = 2021-06-13\n| author         = FandomWire Staff\n| date           = 2019-11-27\n| archiveurl     = https://web.archive.org/web/20210507165049/https://fandomwire.com/exclusive-dungeons-dragons-character-details-revealed/\n| archivedate    = 2021-05-07\n}}\n{{quote|Fantasy adventure centering on a warrior and his band of mystical creatures as they embark on a dangerous journey to find a mythical treasure.}}\nBoth also revolve around the gold dragon Palarandusk and the [[Triadic knight|Triadic Knights]].

He has long hair, a beard, and dark sunken eyes. He and his sister were once slaves, possibly of Razer Horlbar. He is an honorable man but haunted by his sister's death. He explores \"the Demon Temples\" alongside Zanril and Karroway. A leading male role in 88 scenes. (Possibly replaced by Edgin.)\n*Hack Karroway, a [[half-dragon]] and former [[human]]. He can breathe fire, wielded a large bastard sword and wears armor. He is 7 feet tall and has a long tail, and blood-red scales. He is logical and intelligent. He explores \"the Demon Temples\" alongside Hightower and Zanril. A leading male role in 77 scenes played via voice-over.\n*Otivan Trickfoot or Olivan Trickfoot, a [[gnome]] thief. He is cunning and untrustworthy. He wears magical rings. A strong supporting male role in 51 scenes.\n*Alyssa Steelsong, the leader of \"the masked warriors\" and set to take Palarandusk's place as Lord Protector of the Triadic Knights after his death. She uses a mace. A strong supporting female role in 41 scenes.\n*Malanthius, a spellcaster. He is young, slender, and has long hair. A potential ally of the main characters; an important but not leading role. A strong supporting male role in 26 scenes. (This character has a very similar name and occupation as the [[Magister]] [[Malanthus Stormstaern]].)\n*Palarandusk, an ancient [[gold dragon]] and Lord Protector of a group of Triadic Knights. He has catfish-like whiskers and his scales are cracked and spines dangling. He eats gemstones. A supporting male role in 3 scenes. Palarandusk is a gold dragon known to be a protector of Neverwinter and [[Ieirithymbul]]), while \"Lord Protector\" is a title for leaders of Neverwinter like [[Dagult Neverember]]. Palarandusk, with his original title as the Unseen Protector, is confirmed to appear in the final movie by the [https://www.amazon.com/NERF-MicroShots-Dungeons-Dragons-Palarandusk/dp/B0B1VVXMGB/ NERF MicroShots Dungeons & Dragons Palarandusk Blaster].\n*Razer Horlbar, an [[elf]] and leader of \"the cloaked men\", including Damaia and The Beast. He is the main villain and once enslaved Raven and his sister. He is handsome, has jet-black skin, long white hair, and pointed ears. A supporting male role in 14 scenes. (Presumably he is a [[drow]] and a member of [[House Horlbar]].)\n*Damaia or Damala, a [[tiefling]] descended from demons who has horns, a long tail, and pointed teeth. A supporting female role in 10 scenes. (\"Damaia\" is a suggested female tiefling name in ''[[Player's Handbook 4th edition]]'' and ''[[Player's Handbook 5th edition]]''.)\n*The Beast, a brutish warrior. He is huge and wears a cloak and a blank wooden mask. A supporting male role in 9 scenes.\n*Bickety, a human swordsman and adventurer with a scarred face. A supporting male role in 9 scenes.\n*Zanril, a warlock adventurer. He's bald. He explores \"the Demon Temples\" alongside Hightower and Karroway. A supporting male role in 9 scenes.\n*Skeever, a [[half-orc]] adventurer. A supporting male role in 7 scenes."
