Faerie fire was a evocation or alteration spell that outlined a target.
Faerie fire caused a glowing lining around targets in a selected area.
All versions of the spell made a target easier to hit, but the post-Spellplague version also caused radiant damage and slowed the target. The pre-Spellplague version negated the effects of spells like blur or darkness.
Other than the usual vocal and somatic components one version needed foxfire.
Drow had the innate ability to cast faerie fire. This ability was granted to them by Faerzress. The drow used the ability in combat as well as to decorate their cities.
Experienced knights of the Blue Moon gained the ability to cast faerie fire up to three times per day.
