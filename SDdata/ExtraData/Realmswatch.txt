Realmswatch was a column running from 2000 to 2001, as a build-up to the publication of the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition book. It showed sneak peeks and behind-the-scenes explanations of the subjects, as well as previewing art.
Special note Almost all of the content of Realmswatch is in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting Book, and these should not be cited if it is possible in any way to cite the latter. Most of those templates should not be needed.
