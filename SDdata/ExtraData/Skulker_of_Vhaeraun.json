Followers who didnt believe or simply didnt know about their gods demise continued with their prayers to Vhaeraun and these prayers were answered, though none knew by exactly what. Whatever answered their prayers, it gave the Vhaeraunites their magical powers. Divine casters regained their spells and lay-worshipers also gained some minor abilities.\nFor the drow, the post-Spellplague era was a time when Lolths rule was almost unchecked due to the competition being dead. The church of Vhaeraun continued their opposition work while another religious alternative to Lolth was Ghaunadaur.\nAs a general rule, a skulker of Vhaerauns abilities were directed at getting into places and coming safely out again, or they revolved around poison.\nAll skulkers were able to increase the power of applied poison with an ability called skulkers venom. With increased skill, they trained themselves in the art of stealth and acrobatics with the intent to break into their enemies houses. The most accomplished ones trained themselves in the skills to drop the offensive capabilities of enemies who were victims of their poison.\nOptionally, they also learned the abilities grace of the Masked Lord, noxious step, and guise of the faithful.\nCategoryCharacter themes (4e)\nhbo19k83kn9nrlwpv4hf7ogz4ipt7lh"
