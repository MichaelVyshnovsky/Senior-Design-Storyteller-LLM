Kharah was a title among the Numtanajd people of the High Desert of west Zakhara.
A new kharah was elected every year at the end of summer in Fabada. A kharah was elected for each of the three large families of the Numtanajd. They were always a male of at least 50 years of age. The trio of kharah made all of the decisions for the entire community, and nothing would happen unless a given task was unanimously agreed upon by the three kharah.
Traditionally a newly elected kharah would shave their head and burn the hair in a ceremonial fire.
