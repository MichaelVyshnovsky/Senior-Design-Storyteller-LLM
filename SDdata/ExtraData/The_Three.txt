'''The Three''' was a collective term for the [[deity|deities]] worshiped in the land of [[Rashemen]]. Originally these were [[Chauntea|Bhalla (Chauntea)]], [[Mystra (Midnight)|the Hidden One (Mystra)]] and [[Mielikki|Khelliara (Mielikki)]]. Sometime after Mystra's "death" and the resulting [[Spellplague]] she was replaced by [[Sel√ªne]] in the Rashemi pantheon.
