        "mainbody": "Search and Rescue is a free-to-play stand-alone quest for Dungeons & Dragons Online where the player characters look for lost adventurers in the Stonelands. The adventure was added to the game on June 1, 2016 as part of Update 31.\nSearch and Rescue has the player find Popkin Shortshanks in Eveningstar, a gnome in desperate need of assistance. She was adventuring with her friends in the Stonelands, but they were overcome by foes and need immediate rescue. Thanks to some word of recall-infused trinkets given by a \"nice old gent with a weird hat\", its possible to rescue her friends as soon as they are found. In the Stonelands, the entry to the tomb is surrounded by typical inhabitants of the wilderness like scorpions and harpies, and the interior filled by the ancient undead. The mummy Laeron is roused and does battle, and a secret tunnel behind his throne shows the way to deeper caverns and the Underdark where Popkins friends were trapped.\nFortunately, Jarus, Helayna, and Kirina are merely isolated and hiding, though Liantor Stoneborn was slain and looted by Clan Daeronnax kobolds. At the end of the tunnels is the lair of the red dragon Daeronnax, who has kept Tristran of Daggerford as a snack for later, and who can be rescued. Thus, all but one of Popkins friends can be saved.\nDown an optional branching route is a secret Drow outpost ruled by Mistress Laerionvyr, who has a particular interest in summoning slaadi for her forces, including Iltharis the Terrible.\nDaeronnax • Helayna • Iltharis the Terrible • Jarus Brithandir • Kirina Aelorothi • Laerionvyr • Laeron • Liantor Stoneborn • Popkin Shortshanks • Tristran of Daggerford • Vurdin\nbat • draegloth • drider • drow • harpy • hezrou • human • kobold • lizardfolk • mephit (fire • sand) • ox • phaerimm • scorpion (Stonelands) • slaad (blue • green • red) • tomb guardian • undead (mummy • quell • skeleton • wheep) • umber hulk\nheartwood • festering mummy wrappings • drow outrunner armor • empowered dragonscale • earthen mantle • word of recall\nCormyr • Drow outpost • Eveningstar • Netherese tomb • Stonelands • Underdark\nClan Daeronnax\nLolth"
