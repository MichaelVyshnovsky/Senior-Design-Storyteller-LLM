        "mainbody": "Gem magic''', also called '''gem-magic''' or '''gemstone magic''', was an application of [[magic]] involving the use of [[gemstone]]s. There were two broad types of gem magic: the first type involved attuning gemstones to store or affix [[spell]]s for subsequent use, and the second type involved tapping into the natural magical properties of different types of gemstones.",
        "Gem Attunement": {
            "History": "This form of gem magic was practiced in ancient [[Netheril]], where so-called \"gem masters\" created attuned gems and would sometimes embed them as traps in tombs and the like.\n\nBy the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the secrets of the creation of attuned gems had been lost. When such gems were recovered from ancient treasure vaults, they would often release their stored spells unexpectedly before crumbling to dust in treasure hunters’ hands.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the practice of attuning gems and creating ''gem wards'' had been rediscovered, and some gods were known to grant the power of gem attunement to their more free-spirited followers.\n\nAs of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[deep gnome]]s practiced a similar form of magic in which they created ''[[spell gem]]s'' that could store a single spell and then release that spell at the command of the gem's wielder. These items were known to be used by the [[Stoneheart  Enclave]] of [[Blingdenstone]], and the means behind their creation was a closely guarded secret."

        "Natural Gem Magic": {
            "History": "The ancient Netherese used [[chrysoberyl]] to make audio recordings of everything from warnings to instructions to motivational speeches. They also made use of [[azurite]] charms to protect themselves from burns in their kitchens (a practice that was also held by folk from [[Halruaa]], [[Myth Drannor]], and [[Calimshan]]).\n\nMany folk across [[Faerûn]] were known to make use of innate gem magic. Folk from as far and wide as [[Waterdeep]], [[Sembia]], and [[Chessenta]] would wear [[tremair]] stones sown into their clothes, offering them protection from [[curse]]s. Calishite and Sembian furniture was sometimes trapped by inlaying [[boakhar]], which could shoot bursts of fire. In [[Rashemen]], the [[wychlaran]] used [[Laeral's tears]] to bolster the toughness of their [[Rashemaar berserkers|berserkers]], while their enemies, the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], experimented with [[thuparlial]] to try to empower their fire-based spells. In [[Impiltur]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, [[Pelathyon Hawkryn]] came to be known for wielding \"moonstone magic\" in which he substituted [[moonstone]] for most of his material components. \n\nOther gems were wrongly believed to have properties that they did not, such as [[amber]], and [[Tiger eye agate]].\n\nA form of this gem magic was practiced in ancient [[Mulhorand]], where the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|god-kings]] were the first to create mighty [[gemstone golem]]s which leveraged the natural magics of [[Ruby golem|rubies]], [[Emerald golem|emeralds]], and [[Diamond golem|diamonds]] to imbue the constructs with potent abilities. However, the secrets of their creation were lost as the god-kings dwindled, and were only rediscovered in the 1360s DR by [[Zulkir]] [[Aznar Thrul]] of the Red Wizards, however his understanding of gem magic was incomplete, When he built an army of [[golem]]s to attack on Rashemen, they proved to be unpredictable and often required a dozen wizards to control. Ultimately, his whole army had broken away from his control by {{Yearlink|1372}}.",
