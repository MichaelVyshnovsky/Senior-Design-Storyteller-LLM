The Pack was a gathering of all of the wolves on the Moonshae Isles summoned by the goddess Earthmother to help fight the beast Kazgoroth.
The Pack followed the strongest individual among them, without regard for good or evil. During the Darkwalker War, the Pack was taken over by the werewolf Erian, a servant of Kazgoroth, who killed the previous leader and led them on a rampage against the Ffolk. The Earthmother then guided the hound Canthus, companion of Prince Tristan Kendrick, to kill Erian and lead the Pack in the defense of the Ffolk once more. Under Canthuss leadership, the Pack turned the tide of battle at Caer Corwell, killing many of the Northlander invaders so the Ffolk could rally their defense.
