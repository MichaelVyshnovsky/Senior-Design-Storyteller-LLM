{{DEFAULTSORT:Pack, the}}
'''The Pack''' was a gathering of all of the [[wolf|wolves]] on the [[Moonshae Isles]] summoned by the goddess [[Earthmother]] to help fight the beast [[Kazgoroth]].

The Pack followed the strongest individual among them, without regard for good or evil. During the [[Darkwalker War]], the Pack was taken over by the [[werewolf]] [[Erian]], a servant of Kazgoroth, who killed the previous leader and led them on a rampage against the [[Ffolk]]. The [[Earthmother]] then guided the [[dog|hound]] [[Canthus]], companion of [[Tristan Kendrick|Prince Tristan Kendrick]], to kill Erian and lead the Pack in the defense of the Ffolk once more. Under Canthus's leadership, the Pack turned the tide of battle at [[Caer Corwell]], killing many of the [[Northlander]] invaders so the Ffolk could rally their defense.
