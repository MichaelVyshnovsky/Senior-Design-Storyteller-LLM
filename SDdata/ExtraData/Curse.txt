A curse was a powerful, negative magical effect placed upon a person, place, or object.
Curses could have a wide variety effects, but often involved weakening, injuring, or thwarting the intentions of an afflicted individual or destabilizing an afflicted item.
In general, a curse was hard to remove. Only a handful of specialized spells&mdashsuch as remove curse&mdashcould hope to remove even a weak curse. A more powerful curse needed great power to remove, if it was possible to remove at all.
The most fundamental curse was the one created by the spell bestow curse. Other common spell curses were bestow greater curse, curse water, geas/quest, hex, Laerals crowning touch, and lesser geas.
Any mundane or magical item could become a cursed item, and pass that curse onto individuals who possessed the item. Often, this type of item was created as a trap by an individual, an accident, or the decay of time.
Cursed weapons would bind themselves to a wielder, forcing them to fight to the death or otherwise preventing the wielder from getting rid of the weapon.
This type of curse often started as one of the other types, but changed over time to affect the whole family of a cursed individual. In some rare cases, a powerful curse could be put on a whole family.
This type of curse was inflicted on a person, place or thing in accord with a gods ethos. They were always powerful and often spectacular. A primary example was the Curse of Mystra, which afflicted any individual who willfully copied the sigil of a mage with the intent to impersonate that mage.
The existence of undead was sometimes considered a curse on life.
Some warlocks had the ability to bestow minor curses onto their foes in battle, which made the afflicted targets more vulnerable to the warlocks attacks and magics.
