A '''curse''' was a powerful, negative [[magic]]al effect placed upon a person, place, or object.

==Effects==
Curses could have a wide variety effects, but often involved weakening, injuring, or thwarting the intentions of an afflicted individual or destabilizing an afflicted item.

In general, a curse was hard to remove. Only a handful of specialized [[spell]]s&mdash;such as ''[[remove curse]]''&mdash;could hope to remove even a weak curse. A more powerful curse needed great power to remove, if it was possible to remove at all.

== Types of Curses==
===Spell Curses===
The most fundamental curse was the one created by the spell ''[[bestow curse]]''. Other common spell curses were ''[[bestow greater curse]]'', ''[[curse water]]'', ''[[geas/quest]]'', ''[[hex]]'', ''[[Laeral's crowning touch]]'', and ''[[lesser geas]]''.

===Item Curses===
Any mundane or magical item could become a [[:Category:Cursed items|cursed item]], and pass that curse onto individuals who possessed the item. Often, this type of item was created as a trap by an individual, an accident, or the decay of time.

Cursed weapons would bind themselves to a wielder, forcing them to fight to the death or otherwise preventing the wielder from getting rid of the weapon.

===Family Curses===
This type of curse often started as one of the other types, but changed over time to affect the whole family of a cursed individual. In some rare cases, a powerful curse could be put on a whole family.

===Divine Curses===
This type of curse was inflicted on a person, place or thing in accord with a [[god]]'s ethos. They were always powerful and often spectacular. A primary example was the [[Curse of Mystra]], which afflicted any individual who willfully copied the [[Mage sigil|sigil]] of a [[mage]] with the intent to impersonate that mage.

=== Undeath===
The existence of undead was sometimes considered a curse on life.

===Warlock's Curses===
Some [[warlock]]s had the ability to bestow minor curses onto their foes in battle, which made the afflicted targets more vulnerable to the warlock's attacks and magics.
