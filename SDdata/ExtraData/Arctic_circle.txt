The arctic circle was a druid circle associated with the cold climate where glaciers formed and winters were harsh. Druids who took up the cause of nature in such a climate had an affinity for this circle and the suite of spells that came with them.
Fairly new druids could cast both hold person and spike growth. More versed druids could use the sleet storm, slow, freedom of movement, and ice storm spells. Those that had gained significant skill in such a circle could cast commune with nature and cone of cold.
