When the power was updated for 2 edition AD&D, its \"Area of Effect\" was updated to mention only items, even specifying a target weight of , though the mentions of skin and hair in the effects section implies that it might be possible to target creatures.\nThis power could be used to target one item, weighing no more than , within  of the psion. Early instances of this power found that all effects occurred after a period of ten minutes. Later documentation found that molecular agitations were actually evident as early as one minute, but that their severity increased the longer the power was active for.\nFor the first minute of active use readily flammable material would ignite and burn brightly, such as paper, parchment, straw, dry grass, etc. Skin would become red and tender. And wood would darken.\nAfter two minutes of active use wood would begin to smoke and smolder, metal would become hot to the touch (an effect some described as being similar to the spell heat metal), skin would begin to blister, hair would begin to smolder, and paint would shrivel.\nAfter three minutes of active use wood would properly become aflame, metal would be scorching, skin would be burning away, water would be boiling, and lead would melt.\nAfter four minutes, molecular agitation would cause even steel to grow soft, and after five minutes of active use steel would melt.\nThis power was one of the prerequisites for learning the psychokinesis discipline detonate.\n* Kyorl Odran, a drow psionicist and the matron mother of House Oblodra.\n* Amethyst dragons, a species of gem dragon.\n* Aratha, a psionic species of giant beetles.\n* Some duergar exhibited this power.\n* Beljuril dragons, another species of the innately psionic gem dragons.\n* Greater shedu.\n* Lythlyx.\n* Phoenixes.\n* Planetars.\n* Thonots, psionic equivalents of shamans within quaggoth society, possessed molecular agitation as one of their psionic powers.\nCategoryPsychokinesis powers\n5nb3irhc3mlzgfzw7qlsrgxadd46cp1"
