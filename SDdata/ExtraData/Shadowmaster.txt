'''Shadowmaster''' was the title given to the leader of the [[malaugrym]] race.{{Cite dungeon/206/Ecology of the Malaugrym|4}} While any malaugrym could claim the title, and many referred to themselves as "shadowmasters", only the malaugrym who slew the previous true owner of the title would be recognized as Shadowmaster among all malaugryms. Thus, the true Shadowmaster was sometimes distinguished as the '''Great Shadowmaster''' or the '''Shadowmaster Supreme'''.

==Activities==
The Shadowmaster dwelt in the [[Castle of Shadows]], and was nominally recognized as the director of the malaugryms' overarching schemes and plots to seize control of [[Faerûn]], although in practice the malaugrym would prioritize their personal goals over those of the Shadowmaster.{{Cite dungeon/206/Ecology of the Malaugrym|3}} 

A Shadowmaster was generally understood to be the most powerful [[wizard]] among the malaugryms, and the title implied that they were one of the few capable of performing [[spells]] or rituals that allowed malaugryms to travel between the [[Plane of Shadow]] and the [[Material Plane]]. Because malaugryms were always desirous of traveling to the Material Plane to subjugate and feed on the peoples there, most went out of their way to please the current Shadowmaster. This made the Shadowmaster one of the few individuals in existence who could compel multiple malaugryms to work together, or who could order any given malaugrym to do or not do something.

A given Shadowmaster could theoretically rule the malaugrym in perpetuity as the race did not die of old age. However, they did weaken with age, so it was inevitable that a Shadowmaster would be slain and usurped.{{Cite dungeon/206/Ecology of the Malaugrym|2}} Challenges for the title came every few decades.

==History==
The original head of the malaugrym "family" was [[Malaug]], the race's progenitor. Following his disappearance in the {{YearlinkName|240}},{{Cite dungeon/206/Ecology of the Malaugrym|1}} the tradition of a Shadowmaster stepping in to lead the clan was established.

As the leaders and chief schemers of the malaugrym, Shadowmasters were responsible for any large-scale actions taken by the malaugrym race to infiltrate Faerûn. as well as their efforts to capitalize on the chaos of the [[Time of Troubles]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR.

In the {{YearlinkName|1222}}, [[Khelben Arunsun]] ended the Harpstar Wars by seizing control of the current Shadowmaster's mind and convincing the remaining malaugrym that continued conflict with the [[Harpers]] was too costly. This Shadowmaster was slain by a younger malaugrym to seize her title, and the backlash would have incapacitated Khelben if it weren't for the intervention of [[Elminster]].

[[Dhalgrave]] was the Shadowmaster in [[1358 DR]], The next Shadowmaster was [[Huerbara]], who proclaimed she would move more carefully.

As of the 1370s DR, the current Shadowmaster was investigating the logistics of pulling all of [[Toril]] into the Plane of Shadow and making it into a cruel playground for his malaugryms.
