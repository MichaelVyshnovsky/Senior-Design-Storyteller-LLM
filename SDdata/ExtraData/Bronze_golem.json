        "mainbody": "Bronze golems''' were humanoid shaped [[construct]]s constructed out of [[bronze]]{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|17-18}} that were similar to [[iron golem]]s in some respects.",
        "Description": "On average these golems stood {{SI|12|ft}}.",
        "Abilities": "These golems could only be harmed by weapons with a ''+3'' or greater [[enchantment]]. [[Magic]]al lightning could slow a bronze golem down, whilst magical [[fire]] could heal them. And because their bodies were constructed of bronze these golems were not subject to rust.\n\nMuch like iron golems, some bronze golems could breath noxious gas, whilst other bronze golems lacked this functionality.",
        "History": "In the month of [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]], in the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]] found themselves transported to the plane of [[Carceri]] after defending the [[githzerai]] fortress of [[Tah'Darr]] from a [[tanar'ri]] incursion. At the urgings of the fallen [[paladin]] [[Elendil]], the adventurers sought out [[Mount Othrys]] and [[Cronus]] for a way back to [[Toril]].{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|9-10}} When they entered the crumbling palace they found Cronus to be deep into some kind of [[Cosmic Game]] with the [[marilith]] [[Cucathne]], who was entertaining him with the game in hopes of negotiating the use of Othrys as a tanar'ri staging ground against Tah'Darr.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|17,32}} Cronus was unwilling to answer any questions that the mortals posed, but offered to gate them home if they would fight as part of his forces in the game.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|16}}\n\nAs part of this \"game of the gods\" the adventurers each had their bodies and minds temporarily merged with a powerful [[fiend]] somewhere in the multiverse, then were placed in a combat arena.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|32}} There they did battle with bronze golems and a weak child of the [[hecatoncheire]]s,{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|17-18}} unintentionally slighting Cronus as they were creatures of his own realm. After the adventurers earned their trip home they found that the battle had actually occurred in Ravens Bluff, discovering the [[Ministry of Art]] to be in ruins.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|19}}\n\nA year later in [[1374 DR]], bronze golems were one of many varieties of golems used as guardians inside the [[Onyx Tower]]."
