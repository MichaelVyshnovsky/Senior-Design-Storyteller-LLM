As of [[1370 DR]], companies such as [[Anvilfist Banner]], the [[Golden Hand]], and [[Thalorin's Manymetals]] traded in this district. These companies operated up to 90 guards to prevent \"accidental\" injuries from the Luskan militia, who were known to fire into the district for \"blood money\".",
