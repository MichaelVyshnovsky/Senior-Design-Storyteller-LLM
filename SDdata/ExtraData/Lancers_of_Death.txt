The '''Lancers of Death''' were the spectral forces that rose nightly to do battle with the undead guardians of the [[Crypt of Al-Alisk]] in the [[Desert of Al-Alisk]]. They had been warriors fighting the clan in a blood feud while they still lived.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|109}}

==Overview==
The cities of [[Pazar]] and [[Akhir]] entered into a blood feud with the [[Al-Alisk]] clan after [[Habrauk Al-Nirin]], of the aforementioned clan, stole Princess [[Sithal Al-Husn]] of Pazar from the streets of Akhir in her wedding night. The feud lasted for five generations, and combined with the [[Curse of Amun-Re]], led to the complete extinction of all their bloodlines.

However, even after, the dead in the conflict continued to rise nightly to keep on battling; the Lancers of Death would surge from Akhir and crash against the defensive lines around the [[Crypt of Al-Alisk]] where the princess was held in temporal stasis.

In {{yearlink|1356}}, adventurers released the princess from stasis, and allowed the Lancers of Death to move on into the afterlife.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|125}}
