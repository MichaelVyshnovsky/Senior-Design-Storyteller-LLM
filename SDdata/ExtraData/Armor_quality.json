Pieces of armor enchanted in such a way usually made them more resistant to certain types of damage, enhanced the wearer's abilities, or allowed them to hide or creep easier.",
        "Enchantment": "In order to enchant an existing piece of equipment, a versed [[enchanter]] had to use a powerful spell during the process. However, not all pieces of armor could be enchanted. Some specific enchantments were limited to the type of material the armor was made from.",

            "Any Armor": "* ''[[Negative energy protection (armor quality)|Negative energy protection]]'': made the wearer more resistant to attacks associated with energy from the [[Negative Material plane]].\n* ''[[Nimbleness]]'': made the armor less restrictive, and reduced its weight.\n* ''[[Proof against transmutation]]'': made it so the wearer's form could not be changed ([[polymorph]]ed or [[petrify|petrified]]).\n* ''[[Magic eating]]'': gave the wearer a degree of resistance to [[magic]].",
            "Metal Armor": "* ''[[Blueshine]]'': gave the armor immunity to [[acid]] and rusting, and allowed the wearer to hide more efficiently.\n* ''[[Everbright]]'': made the armor incredibly bright, as well as providing the wielder with resistance to acid."
