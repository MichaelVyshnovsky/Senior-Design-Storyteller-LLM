        "mainbody": "'''''Ignidraco''''' was a genus of prehistoric [[proto-dragon]]s.",
        "Ecology": "Scholars from [[Candlekeep]] theorized that ''ignidracos'' had an evolved digestive tract that enabled them to regurgitate intestinal gas and ignite it with an enzymatic, hypergolic reaction in the back of their throats, making them capable of breathing out blasts of fire.",
        "History": "Scholars believed that ''ignidracos'' were an evolved strain of the ''[[eodraco]]'' genus. It was theorized that certain species of ''ignidracos'' developed the first stages of self-awareness and real intelligence, not just the improved animal cunning shown by earlier species of eodracos. A few scholars believed ''ignidracos'' began to develop the earliest manifestations of the [[draconic language]], although there was not enough evidence to prove anything. It was also believed that, as ''ignidracos'' depended mostly on their intelligence for survival, the species began to develop longer life spans.\n\nScholars didn't have enough evidence to theorize why it happened, but eventually ignidracos evolved into two new genera: the ''[[ferrodraco]]s'' and the ''[[inficedraco]]s''.\n\nDetractors of the proto-dragon theory believed that the fact that some species of dragons were capable of breathing out kinds of elemental energy other than fire (such as the [[blue dragon]]s ability to breathe out lightning) made the theory of the evolved digestive tract illogical, and that the theory that explained the [[white dragon]]s ability to breathe out frost as some sort of chemical reaction capable of absorbing heat was just rubbish."
