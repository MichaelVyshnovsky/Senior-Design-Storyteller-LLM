'''Spirit''' was a term used for a variety of distinct but related concepts, creatures and types of being.

==Spirits of the Living and the Dead==
{{Quote|If anything, our souls are more free after death, transcending planar barriers in search of a resting place that best befits our deeds, beliefs, and station in life.|''[[Iosefa Elgin]], in an excerpt from [[Metatext: Rebound]]''.}}

In everyday language, "having spirit" meant possessing a lively temperament.<ref><ref><ref>

On a deeper level, the spirit was the animating lifeforce of a being, often equated with the '''soul'''.<ref><ref group="note">In 1{{st}}-edition D&D, according to [[Deities & Demigods 1st edition|''Deities & Demigods'']], there was a distinction between the terms "spirit" and "soul". Simply put, souls could be resurrected and spirits could not. Spirits, rather, were reincarnated. Interestingly, [[human]]s, [[dwarves]], [[gnome]]s, [[halfling]]s, and [[half-elves]] had souls, while [[elves]], [[orc]]s, and [[half-orc]]s had spirits. This distinction seems to have not been followed in later editions.

If the body of an inhabitant of the Realms died, their spirit usually [[Afterlife|moved on]] to become a [[petitioner]] of their respective deity, or, in the case of unbelievers, one of the [[False]] or the [[Faithless]]. Sometimes a [[curse]], the tragic importance of some unfinished business, a will of extreme [[evil]] or [[good]], or [[Necromancy|necromantic magic]] interfered with this course of events, causing the spirit to remain on [[Toril]] and become an [[undead]] creature.<ref><ref><ref><ref>

In [[Mulhorand]], the [[Church of Osiris]] believed that people had two spirits within their bodies, known as '''ba''' and '''ka'''. The former was said to remain in a mortal's body when it died, while the latter moved on to be judged by [[Osiris]].

==Nature Spirits==

The environment was populated with a near-infinite variety of creatures and forces with a close connection to nature, also often collectively called spirits. Among these were counted the races of the [[dryad]]s and [[nymph]]s.{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|61}}

The [[Nature spirit#The Nine Trickster Gods of Omu|Nine Trickster Gods of Omu]] were also considered primal spirits in the jungles of [[Chult]].

The land of [[Rashemen]] was also host to a great deal of nature spirits, such as the [[telthor]], [[thomil]], [[uthraki]], and strongest of all the [[wood man]].

Next to the spirit of each physical part of nature, [[green elves]] revered a number of [[Deity|god]]-like wilderness spirits, most important among them [[Bear (spirit)|Bear]], [[Coyote (spirit)|Coyote]], [[Eagle (spirit)|Eagle]], [[Raven (spirit)|Raven]], [[Snake (spirit)|Snake]], and [[Wolf (spirit)|Wolf]].<ref><ref>

==Spirits of Kara-Tur==
On the continent of [[Kara-Tur]] spirits called [[kami]], or sometimes nature gods, represented all aspects of nature and the elements as well as personifying places.<ref> They (together with other beings like [[Lung dragon|oriental dragons]]) were organized in a great hierarchy called the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]]. Consequently, the plane paralleling the lands of Kara-Tur they resided in was named the [[Spirit World]], and the language of the Celestial Court was also called the [[Spirit Tongue]].<ref><ref>

Related were several races that sprang from the union of spirits and humans, like [[hengeyokai]] and [[spirit folk]].

The eastern continent also had its share of undead spirits: They were condemned to their status by the [[Lords of Karma]]. They were shut up in the [[Underworld]] during the day, and terrorized the lands of the living by night. Among them were counted the [[bajang]], [[bisan]], [[gaki]], [[chu-u]], [[con-tinh]], and [[kuei]].

Despite the name, spirit creatures were not necessarily incorporeal; many had flesh and blood.<ref>

Kara-Tur's [[Bavanese]] people had their own fluid system of describing spirits based on supernatural encounters. This system was comprised of five distinct categories &ndash; [[danjang]], [[demit]], [[lelembut]], [[memedi]], and [[tujul]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://notes-culture.blogspot.com/2019/10/geertz-religion-of-java.html|author=Nicholas Herriman|title=Geertz, Religion of Java (detailed summaries)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20231204133436/http://notes-culture.blogspot.com/2019/10/geertz-religion-of-java.html|archivedate=2023-12-04|accessdate=2024-07-16}}<ref group="note" name="Inspiration">The five terms used by Bavanese people to describe spirits are undoubtedly taken from terms used by the [[Wikipedia:Javanese|Javanese]], particularly the [[Wikipedia:Abangan|Abangan]], to refer to different types of spirits. The way each category is described is also noticeably similar to how each is described in the book ''The Religion of Java'' by [[Wikipedia:Clifford Geertz|Clifford Geertz]]. This text was released in 1960, a full twenty-eight years prior to the publication of ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms''.
