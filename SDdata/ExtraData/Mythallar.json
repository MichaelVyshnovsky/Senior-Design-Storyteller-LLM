The globe shed a very bright light—similar to the disc of the sun—with dimmer shadows and shapes moving across its surface. An ornate stand kept the perfectly spherical device in place.\nCreated in 845 NY () by Ioulaum, the mythallars allowed arcanists to create quasimagical items without draining their lifeforce. This allowed for a rising trade with the middle class. The first large scale application, the floating city, appeared in the year 866 NY (), Ioulaums Enclave, named Xinlenal. By  (1048 NY), thirteen had been constructed. By  (1652 NY), Netheril began lifting one enclave into the sky per year.\nSakkors High Arcanist Xolund the Maker improved on mythallar design by infusing his enclaves mythallar with a rudimentary sentience, giving it self-awareness and also increasing the mythallars powers. This breakthrough caused a great stir among the empires arcanists, but the fall of the empire prevented any further effort of duplicating Xolunds feat, making Sakkors mythallar one of a kind.  \nIn the mid-1480s DR, the agents of Thultanthar uncovered an intact mythallar buried inside a mountain glacier deep inside the Storm Horns, in addition to uncovering a Nether Scroll. Under the command of Archwizard Amskar, they excavated and ritually prepared the artifact for reactivation, ultimately using it to create a new enclave made from the glacier itself. Before they could use it as a weapon against Cormyr, the adventurer Oriphaun Huntsilver and his companions attacked the Shadovar forces and killed Archwizard Amskar. Without his control, the enclave began flying erratically and smashed into a nearby mountain, destroying it and the mythallar.\nSakkors mythallar was unique in that its sentience allowed it to direct, focus or withhold its magical powers as instructed.\nTouching a mythallar was a lethal decision. Anyone who touched the device was instantly slain. Any item that touched it, except the stand that contained it, was instantly disintegrated. Any undead that touched the mythallar were destroyed.\nA mythallar could be destroyed by a disintegrate spell as happened to the enclave of Tanathras in  (3212 NY).\nStorm Horns mythallar below.jpg|The mythallar of Amskars enclave, reactivated.\nStorm Horns mythallar above.jpg|The result a new flying enclave.\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryNetherese items\nCategoryItems\nfuzz9ajieac2msy2e0bqj5d2hm0o3c6"
