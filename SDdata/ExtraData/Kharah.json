        "mainbody": "''Kharah''''' was a title among the [[Numtanajd]] people of the [[High Desert]] of [[west Zakhara]].",
        "Activities": "A new ''kharah'' was elected every year at the end of summer in [[Fabada]]. A ''kharah'' was elected for each of the three large families of the Numtanajd. They were always a male of at least 50 years of age. The trio of ''kharah'' made all of the decisions for the entire community, and nothing would happen unless a given task was unanimously agreed upon by the three ''kharah''.\n\nTraditionally a newly elected ''kharah'' would shave their head and burn the hair in a ceremonial fire."
