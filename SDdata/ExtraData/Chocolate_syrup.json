        "mainbody": "Chocolate syrup was a type of chocolate-flavored condiment in the realms, made in part with powdered cocoa.\n* Chocolate crab cakes, a peculiar brand of gnomish highsunfeast from the city of Ravens Bluff.\nSometime in the 15 century DR, a Waterdhavian citizen came into the offices of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, wishing for them to absolve him of a bet he had made at a gambling table to a spellcaster that he believed to be Khelben Arunsun, despite popular consensus among Waterdhavians being that the Blackstaff was dead. The man claimed that the victor of the bet demanded he provide one of two impossible things by the next night either an elemental of chocolate syrup or \"a mermaid succubus whos human from the waist down.\" If he failed to provide either, the man would be polymorphed into either a lawn gnome or a myconid fountain forced to hold a selection of vegetables. The exasperated magist on staff that day, Maerlus the Magnificent, assured the man that the Watchful Order could provide him a short-term semblance of either in return for the appropriate fees."
