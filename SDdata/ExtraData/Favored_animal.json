        "Description": "Deities could show their powers through major manifestations and minor manifestations. The appearance of an animal fell into the latter category.\n\nMost deities had some kind of mundane animal as their favored animal. Some deities were specific in the coloration of their favored animals. For example, [[Vhaeraun]] had only black [[cat]]s as his favored animal.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|8, 15}}\n\nReal or illusory specimens of these animals were sent by deities to inform mortals of something. For example, [[Lolth]] sent her favored animals—[[spider]]s{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|8, 13}}—to show her approval at the conclusion of a ritual. These animals could be made to act according to their normal behavior or in some strange manner by the sending deity.\n\nThe benefit of using animals as an omen was that it was easier for mortals to befriend and get used to animals than the more awesome or monstrous servants of a deity.",
        "Mortals' Reaction": "When a living specimen of a favored animal appeared, it was usually captured. What happened with it afterwards was dependent on how wealthy the capturing community was. If it was rich, the animal was given a pampered and easy life to show the community's devotion to the deity. If the community was poor, the animal was eaten and the best parts of it were sacrificed to the deity.\n\n[[Cleric]]s often summoned [[fiendish creature|fiendish]] or [[celestial creature|celestial]] versions of these animals."
