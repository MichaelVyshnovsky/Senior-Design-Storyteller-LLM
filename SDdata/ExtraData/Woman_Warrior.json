Meanwhile, unaware, Vajra Valmeyjar, a renowned warrior woman, and Timoth Eyesbright, a heroic centaur, had a protracted arm-wrestling contest in the Sel√ªnes Smile tavern. The cosmic alignment amplified the power of their contest, which merged with magic that had sweltered in the heat and tore a mystic nexus point into a rift. This opened a door to an extra-dimensional prison, releasing Aviss and Fellandar to wreak a path of destruction in the city. Khelben Arunsun urged Vajra and Timoth to continue arm-wrestling to hold the door open, before he hurled the villains back in. Vajra and Timoth broke off, closing the rift.\nCategoryConstellations\nCategoryCelestial bodies\n4t0aafx2vf0vnunxkxv53s1r049nzse"
