'''Teraff''' was a young [[Star elf]] firebrand of an orator who, in the early days of the creation of [[Sildëyuir]] preached against peaceful relations with any other nation, even with other [[elves]].

She led a group of renegade star elves on raids against coastal camps of human settlers who she suspected of spying on [[Yuireshanyaar]]. Her fears proved true when she and her group were captured by some of those coastal settlers.

Teraff was tortured to death for not revealing the locations of the ''[[portal]]s'' to Sildëyuir or how to activate them but some of her group managed to escape capture and return home. They told of her tale and she was forever remembered as a heroine and a symbol of inspiration to the star elf people.
