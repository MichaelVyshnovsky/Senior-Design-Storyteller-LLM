Preternatural clarity was a very advanced utterance from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind that used truespeak to sharpen a targets mind in preparation for a task, or to cloud it utterly, if reversed.
In its straight form, by granting the target insight into all that was or had ever been, preternatural clarity allowed them to, within a half minute, gain drastic insight into a task they were attempting. In its reversed form, it acted like a short-lived confusion spell, making the universe incomprehensible to the target.
The recitation was known to logokron devils and, in its reversed form, to garblers.
