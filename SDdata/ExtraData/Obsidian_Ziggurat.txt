The '''Obsidian Ziggurat''' was a haunted pyramid in the [[Shadowfell]].

==Location==
The ziggurat loomed just beyond the border of an abandoned village through which the [[Shadowfell Road]] passed.

==Structure==
It was a tremendous and looming pyramid of glossy black stone with stairs only on the side facing the ruined village.

The uppermost levels appeared to be illuminated by flickering [[torch]]light despite there being no source of this light. Likewise, shadows appeared to dance in this light despite not being cast by anything. These [[shadow]]s sometimes took the form of [[humanoid]]s or [[snake]]s, and seemed to move as if to a [[drum]]beat. If anyone stopped to watch their dance, the shadows attacked their minds, compelling them to climb the pyramid and join in the dance. Once ensnared in this way, a creature was unable to break free of the shadows' compulsion unless physically restrained or forced to stop dancing. Otherwise, after dancing for a full minute, they were transported out of the Shadowfell and to the corresponding pyramid in the Material Plane at the ruins of Sar'Rukoth. By destroying the altar at that pyramid, it was possible to undo this [[magic]] and return to the Shadowfell.

==Inhabitants==
The pyramid's twin on the Material Plane was a site of cult worship by [[wereserpent]]s and [[human]] cultists. They quickly surrounded anyone who was delivered to them by the shadows' dance.
