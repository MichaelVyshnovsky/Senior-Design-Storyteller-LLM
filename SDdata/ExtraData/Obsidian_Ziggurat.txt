The Obsidian Ziggurat was a haunted pyramid in the Shadowfell.
The ziggurat loomed just beyond the border of an abandoned village through which the Shadowfell Road passed.
It was a tremendous and looming pyramid of glossy black stone with stairs only on the side facing the ruined village.
The uppermost levels appeared to be illuminated by flickering torchlight despite there being no source of this light. Likewise, shadows appeared to dance in this light despite not being cast by anything. These shadows sometimes took the form of humanoids or snakes, and seemed to move as if to a drumbeat. If anyone stopped to watch their dance, the shadows attacked their minds, compelling them to climb the pyramid and join in the dance. Once ensnared in this way, a creature was unable to break free of the shadows compulsion unless physically restrained or forced to stop dancing. Otherwise, after dancing for a full minute, they were transported out of the Shadowfell and to the corresponding pyramid in the Material Plane at the ruins of SarRukoth. By destroying the altar at that pyramid, it was possible to undo this magic and return to the Shadowfell.
The pyramids twin on the Material Plane was a site of cult worship by wereserpents and human cultists. They quickly surrounded anyone who was delivered to them by the shadows dance.
