A '''just chancellor''', or the '''Lord Just Chancellor''', of [[Tethyr]] was the primary legal authority of the kingdom. 

==Hierarchy==
The Lord Just Chancellor was superior to four sub-chancellors:
* the Law Chancellor,
* the Magistrates Chancellor,
* the Sheriffs' Chancellor, and
* the Title Chancellor.

The Just Chancellor also directed a group of judges known as [[High Justicars]] and [[Justicars]].

==Duties==
The Just Chancellor and his four subordinates oversaw the magistrates and sheriffs, the writing of laws, and the issues of noble succession and inheritance.

Only the Justicars, High Justicars, the Just Chancellor, or the queen herself was permitted to make rulings in matters of "High Justice", cases where capital punishment against nobility was involved.

==History==
In earlier times, the king or queen held ultimate legal power in Tethyr, but when Queen [[Zaranda Star]] came to power, she established the courtly title of Just Chancellor to provide a balance of powers.

In [[1370 DR]], the Lord Just Chancellor of the kingdom of Tethyr was former adventurer and Duke of [[Suretmarch]], [[Tardeth Llanistaph]].
