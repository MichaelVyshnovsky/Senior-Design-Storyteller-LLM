'''''Teleport trigger''''' was a [[psionic]] devotion of the [[psychoportation]] [[discipline]] that instantly ''[[teleport (psionic)|teleported]]'' the [[psionicist]] when a predetermined trigger was met.

==Effects==
The psionicist chose a specific trigger that would cause them to ''teleport'' safely away to a predetermined location without conscious effort on their end when the trigger was met. In order for the ''teleport trigger'' to work the psionicist needed to have enough psychic energy to satisfy the power at the time of the trigger.
