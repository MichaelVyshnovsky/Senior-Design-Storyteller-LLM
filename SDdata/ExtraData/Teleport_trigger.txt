Teleport trigger was a psionic devotion of the psychoportation discipline that instantly teleported the psionicist when a predetermined trigger was met.
The psionicist chose a specific trigger that would cause them to teleport safely away to a predetermined location without conscious effort on their end when the trigger was met. In order for the teleport trigger to work the psionicist needed to have enough psychic energy to satisfy the power at the time of the trigger.
* Vhondryl, a psionicist in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor
