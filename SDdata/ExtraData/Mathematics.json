The kind of magic I wield, that of mathematics, is accessible to all who apply themselves.''|[[Isaac Glinkle]] of [[Gond]]}}",
        "Applied Mathematics": "In its basic form, numeracy and mathematics were useful in tallying a business's profits and losses, working out pay for employees and soldiers, and calculating tax given to a government.\n\nAdvanced mathematics was used to track the motions of [[:Category:Celestial_bodies|celestial bodies]] such as [[:Category:stars|stars]] and [[:Category:planets|planets]] in [[Realmspace]], for [[astrology]] and [[astronomy]]. Theories for this were developed by [[Shou]] mathematicians in [[Kara-Tur]]<ref> and in [[Faerûn]] by [[Sephris Dwendon]], the [[Chosen]] of [[Oghma]], who made an [[orrey]] to demonstrate.",
        "Arcane Significance": "A related field was '''numerology''', which dealt with the mystical and magical significance of numbers, such as a person's favorite number, full name, and their time and place of birth. Numerology was used for [[divination]]s that would tell the ideal time for an important action, ceremony, or decree, and in its highest form to find doorways to other [[plane]]s. An example of the former was the spell ''[[personal reading]]'', which provided details of a person based on name, date, and place of birth.\n\nThe [[geometry]] [[school of thaumaturgy]] used diagrams, symbols and complex geometric patterns to channel magic. A [[:Category:Geometry_spells|number of geometry-based spells]] were known.\n\nThe [[Numbers Cult]] was a secret society in [[Chessenta]] active around [[1357 DR]] that worked to define [[magic]] in terms of mathematics. They believed the resulting equations would conquer the world, but their basic premise was apparently based on a fallacy.\n\nHowever, the [[digitalogist]]s of Zakhara succeeded in finding the link between numbers and magic and evoked [[spell]]s through complex mathematical functions and numerology. They had total control over their spells as a result.",
        "Religious Significance": "The myth of the [[Pact Primeval]] told that numbers were created by the first gods of [[law]] to track the many [[demon]]s of chaos they slew. They also created time to tell them how long the war would last. With numbers and time, they suspected the ranks of demons were infinite.<ref>\n\nThe [[Numbers sphere]] provided [[divine]] spells that revealed the mathematical underpinnings to many aspects of reality.\n\nShrines to [[Ubtao]], such as that at the [[aarakocra]] monastery of [[Kir Sabal]], could be decorated with floral and mathematical symbols.",
        "Notable Mathematicians": ":''Main: [[:Category:Mathematicians]]''\n[[Gina bint Kemala]] of [[Huzuz]], Zakhara, was a [[Mystic (Zakhara)|mystic]] who drew her power from the perfection of mathematics and practicing ''al-jebr w'al muqabala'', or \"the art of knitting opposites\" together. Her collection of algebraic texts was the largest in the Land of Fate, with volumes from [[Afyal]], the [[Haunted Lands]], the [[Cities of the Ancients|Ruined Kingdoms]], and even a few [[drow]] works. Her research revealed references to lost mathematical texts, and she often used her research budget to hire adventurers to retrieve them from ruins in dangerous places.{{cite book/City of Delights/Golden Huzuz|55-56}}\n\nOne of the great [[Faerûn]]ian mathematicians of the 14{{th}} century was [[Furier]], who was the tutor of the almost-as-great [[Bezier]] of [[Waterdeep]].\n\n[[Sephris Dwendon]], [[Chosen]] of [[Oghma]], was a mathematician who studied the motions of the worlds of Realmspace.\n\nThe Itza wise men at [[Tulom-Itzi]] had developed just about the most advanced mathematics on [[Toril]].\n\n[[Tomarus]] was a great mathematician who authored and drew ''[[Lex Geographica]]'', an atlas book that collected maps of [[Phlan]] and lands to its north. The book was be found in [[Mantor's Library]] of [[Old Phlan]] in [[1340 DR]]. At the time the work was approximately 200 years old.\n\nZakhara had highly sophisticated systems of numbers and mathematics.\n\nThe Mathematicians were a splinter group of the [[Fraternity of Order]] dedicated to working out the secret principles of the plane of [[Mechanus]].<ref>",
        "Education": "The [[University]] of [[Cimbar]] in Chessenta taught mathematics in one of its colleges in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIn Huzuz, schools for tax collectors included mathematics among their courses.\n\n\nIn any decent-sized city, a sage specialized in mathematics could be found with a 20% chance, or 30% in Waterdeep, around [[1358 DR]].\n\nCollections of books on mathematics could be found in various libraries, such as in the [[Great Library of Perpustakaan]] in [[Tempat Larang]],<ref> in Kir Sabal in [[Chult]],{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|36}}\n\nMathematics was added to [[Shou Lung]]'s [[Civil Service Examination]] at the behest of Emperor [[Kai Tsao Shou Chin]].<ref>",
        "Languages": "The [[Infernal language]] had mathematically exact grammar. It also had a set of characters devoted to numbers and mathematical symbols, making it effective for accounting.<ref>",
        "Creatures": "[[Moigno]]s were two-dimensional beings of Mechanus composed entirely of mathematical equations. They were super-intelligent and dedicated to calculating an exact value of pi.<ref>",
        "History": "In [[1367 DR]],{{AQ-time}} a [[dao]] merchant named [[Okous Aga]] was envious of the mathematical talents of [[Hafiz al-Adad]], a [[dwarf]] [[pragmatist]] [[priest]] in Zakhara. Through a deceitful bargain, Okous stole his very capacity for mathematics: Hafiz lost the numbers 3, 7, 10; then all primes; then all numbers and sums and so on. Hafiz could not read, speak, remember, or understand any numbers, but could give vague amounts like \"few\" and \"many\", and he couldn't use his divine magic. He would recruit adventurers to help him and give them his solution to the ''Calculus of Magical Regress'' to take them to the [[Great Dismal Delve]] after Okous.",
