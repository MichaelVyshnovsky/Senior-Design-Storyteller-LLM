The Blue Kumi Bandits were a group of bandits who plagued the Fochu Peninsula around 1358 DR.
They were originally a group of disaffected bushi of the city of Fochu. Without work, they turned to banditry, using a distinctive blue kumi (braid) dangling down their backs.
At last, they were defeated by the combined efforts of the heroine Oe-Ura and of Osari Minhiro and his foreign adventuring party.
