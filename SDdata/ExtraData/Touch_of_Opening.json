In addition to the monetary demand of this requirement, it was often exceedingly difficult to find a craftsman skilled enough to complete such a task.\nThe Touch of Opening ritual lasted for 30 hours. If successful, the ritual granted the gen the ability to open any lock unless it was barred by magic. The gen needed only to touch the locked item in question for the lock to open.\nIt should be noted that shairs who performed this ritual on their gen were distrusted by other shairs, causing a negative effect upon their station in Zakhara.\nCategoryRituals\nmawualhezfp6udc8c2hwqkcz8oe2uxd"
