The '''swamp circle''' was a [[druid circle]] associated with the fens, marshes, and wetlands filled with abundant life. [[Druid]]s who took up the cause of nature in such a region had an affinity for this circle and the suite of [[spell]]s that came to them without cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).

==Swamp circle spells==
Swamp circle druids were granted the ability to cast ''[[darkness]]'' and ''[[Melf's acid arrow]]''. Advanced druids of such a circle could cast ''[[water walk]]'', ''[[stinking cloud]]'', ''[[freedom of movement]]'', and ''[[locate creature]]''. Greater druids of the swamp circle could cast both ''[[insect plague]]'' and ''[[scrying (spell)|scrying]]''.
