The Path of the Shorn was a religious belief system practiced by a cult, who called themselves the Shorn, in the ruined city of Moradask on the Sea of Salt in the Haunted Lands of interior Zakhara in 1367 DR.
The Path of the Shorn was first realized by a mystic named Saib al-Banu while adventuring in the jungles of the Cities of the Ancients. Saib had a vision where the Gods of the Pantheon led him to believe that all of the hair on his body was excrement keeping him from attaining a higher spiritual state. From that day forward Saib begun practicing the "Path of the Shorn" by ritualistically shaving all of the hair from his body with a razor. Years later, Saib and the Shorn, settled in the ruins of Moradask where they discovered Ishistu, a living idol whom they worshiped as a rat god by covering his altar with their shorn hair.
