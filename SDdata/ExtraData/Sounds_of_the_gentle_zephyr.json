        "Preparation": "All rituals that enhanced a gen's hearing required a set of earrings studded with valuable gems worth at least 500 [[dinar]]s. This ritual lasted for 16 hours.\n\nGens with this ability had impressive hearing, allowing them to notice small noises that most others would ignore. Furthermore, these gen were able to filter the sound entering their ears so they were not constantly bombarded with every little sound. These gen were never surprised unless magic was used to negate the sound made by an approaching person or creature.\n\nA gen with sounds of the gentle zephyr who also had either the [[whispering of the wind]] or the [[sound of lies]] still needed to be in a much closer range to use these abilities.",
