Noober was an extremely talkative man in the town of Nashkel.
* Neeber
* Nüber
* In Baldurs Gate I, the player receives some experience for enduring his conversation and not killing him, though this too is an option. A man who appears in Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn, in the town of Trademeet, may bear some relation to Noober and adopts a similar conversational style. The name Noober is presumably derived from the real world slang term Noob.
