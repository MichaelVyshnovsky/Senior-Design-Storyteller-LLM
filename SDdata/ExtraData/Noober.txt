'''Noober''' was an extremely talkative [[human|man]] in the town of [[Nashkel]].<ref>

* [[Neeber]]
* [[Nüber]]
===Notes===
* In [[Baldur's Gate (game)|Baldur's Gate I]], the player receives some experience for enduring his conversation and not killing him, though this too is an option. A man who appears in [[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]], in the town of [[Trademeet]], may bear some relation to Noober and adopts a similar conversational style. The name Noober is presumably derived from the real world slang term 'Noob.'
