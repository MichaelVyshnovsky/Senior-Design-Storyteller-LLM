The Metatext was the supposed metaphysical text which was said to grant access to all the secrets of the multiverse. It was considered to be a sacred idealization of the church of Deneir and was the magnum opus of their collective scholarly work.
According to Deneiran doctrine, the Metatext manifested in the mortal realms in every text or written document that was ever produced.
It was believed that by reading the Metatext, a mortal individual could ascend to godhood.
Legend stated that the mortal Deneir ascended to divinity, and took on the role of Oghmas deific right hand.
In the , the goddess Mystra was assassinated by Cyric, with the aid of Shar. Upon the goddess death, the Weave ― which allowed for the use and manipulation of magic ―  began to collapse. Deneir attempted to stabilize the Weave by writing himself and the Metatext into the Weave, but was believed to have been destroyed in the process.
At some point, the Deneiran scholar Iosefa Elgin attempted to recreate the Metatext in the tome Metatext Rebound. For that heretical action she was excommunicated from the Deneiran church.
