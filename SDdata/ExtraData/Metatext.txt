The '''Metatext''' was the supposed metaphysical text which was said to grant access to all the secrets of the [[multiverse]]. It was considered to be a sacred idealization of the [[church of Deneir]] and was the magnum opus of their collective scholarly work.

==Nature==
According to Deneiran doctrine, the ''Metatext'' manifested in the [[Prime Material plane|mortal realms]] in every text or written document that was ever produced.

==Powers==
It was believed that by reading the ''Metatext'', a mortal individual could ascend to godhood.

==History==
Legend stated that the mortal Deneir ascended to divinity, and took on the role of [[Oghma]]'s deific right hand.

In the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the goddess [[Mystra]] was assassinated by [[Cyric]], with the aid of [[Shar]].{{Cite web/Dragon Features Archive|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drfe/20080227a|title=Spellplague: The Wailing Years|author=[[Brian R. James]]|date =2008-02-27|accessdate=2008-04-14}} Upon the goddess' death, the [[Weave]] ― which allowed for the use and manipulation of magic ―  began to collapse. Deneir attempted to stabilize the Weave by writing himself and the ''Metatext'' into the Weave, but was believed to have been destroyed in the process.{{page needed}}

At some point, the Deneiran scholar [[Iosefa Elgin]] attempted to recreate the ''Metatext'' in the tome ''[[Metatext: Rebound]]''. For that heretical action she was excommunicated from the Deneiran church.
