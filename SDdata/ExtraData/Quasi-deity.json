Some quasi-deities could not grant spells. A quasi-deity was completely immune to every attempt to tamper with its mind, sap its vitality, or force it into a different form. It had a strong defense against magic but only a limited defense against heat. Weapons not enchanted with magic of an epic scope could not hurt a quasi-deity without problems. These defenses against magic, heat, and non-magical physical attacks grew stronger as a deity rose in rank. After the events of the Second Sundering, the Dead Three became quasi-deities.\nQuasi-deities were subdivided in three categories\nDemigods  Creatures born of the union between a deity and a mortal. This was the weakest form of quasi-deity.\nTitans  These creatures were created by deities. Titans could come into being deliberately, such as through being forged or willed into existence by a deity or as the offspring of two deities or unwittingly, such as the blood spilled by a deity.\nVestiges  Deities who had lost their followers and became nearly powerless. They were regarded as \"dead\" by mortals, but could still be contacted and still possessed some latent power.\nTrue dragons could attain quasi-godhood by mastering the art of a dragon ascendant.\nIf a quasi-deity amassed a sufficiently high number of followers, it could then ascend to true godhood.\n* Tchazzar was a fully developed dragon ascendant who granted spells to his own church.\n* The Dead Three Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul.\n*Lesser deity\n*Intermediate deity\n*Greater deity\nCategoryDeities\ns0jjzvo6r64zd6thm01hpql3h7wzez2"
