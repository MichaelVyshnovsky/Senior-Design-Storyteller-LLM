        "Description": "A quasi-deity once meant that a being was immortal and superior to any mortal creature. Some quasi-deities could not grant spells. A quasi-deity was completely immune to every attempt to tamper with its mind, sap its vitality, or force it into a different form. It had a strong defense against magic but only a limited defense against heat. Weapons not enchanted with magic of an epic scope could not hurt a quasi-deity without problems. These defenses against magic, heat, and non-magical physical attacks grew stronger as a deity rose in rank.{{cite web\n| url            = http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dnd/20030718a\n| title          = D&D v.3.5 Accessory Update Booklet\n| accessdate     = 2016-12-16\n| author         = Andy Collins, David Noonan, James Wyatt\n| date           = 2002-01-01\n| work           = \n| publisher      = Wizards of the Coast\n| pages = 6\n}} After the events of the [[Second Sundering]], the [[Dead Three]] became quasi-deities.",

            "Titans": "These creatures were created by deities. Titans could come into being deliberately, such as through being forged or willed into existence by a deity or as the offspring of two deities; or unwittingly, such as the blood spilled by a deity.",
            "Vestiges": "Deities who had lost their followers and became nearly powerless. They were regarded as \"dead\" by mortals, but could still be contacted and still possessed some latent power.\n\n[[True dragon]]s could attain quasi-godhood by mastering the art of a [[dragon ascendant]].\n\nIf a quasi-deity amassed a sufficiently high number of followers, it could then ascend to true godhood."
