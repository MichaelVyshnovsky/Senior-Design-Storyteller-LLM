        "mainbody": "Legacy of the Green Regent''' was an [[RPGA]] campaign based mostly in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]].\n\n28 modules were supposedly written over 3 years to be distributed to registered Dungeon Masters and played at events such as GenCon and Winter Fantasy. These modules were then supposed to be made commercially available. Five modules were never published and a 29th module never got off the drawing board. None of them were ever sold commercially.\n\nAs part of the RPGA Network, the Legacy of the Green Regent adventures were made available in print; being black and white booklets, sometimes with poster maps and stats cards.\n\n* LGX1 [[Under High Lord's Hall]]\n* LGX2 [[Dungeon of the Hark (LGR)|Dungeon of the Hark]]\n* LGX3 [[Undermountain (LGR)|Undermountain]]\n* LGX4 [[The Ruins of Karse]]\n* LGR1 [[Extermination]]\n* LGR2 [[Gray Hunt]]\n* LGR3 [[Key to Phantoms' Cloister]]\n* LGR4 [[Secret of Phantoms' Cloister]] (unreleased) \n* LGR5 [[Dark Exodus]]\n* LGR6 [[Epidemic]]\n* LGR7 [[Nurture and Nature]]\n* LGR8 [[Rat's Bastard]]\n* LGR9 [[Denial of Resource]]\n* LGR10 [[Into the Fallen Lands]] (unreleased) \n* LGR11 [[Humility]]\n* LGR12 [[Tyranny]]\n* LGR13 [[Book Knowledge]]\n* LGR14 [[Native Intelligence]] (unknown) \n* LGR15 [[Caravan to Waterdeep]] (unknown) \n* LGR16 [[In Cold Blood]]\n* LGR17 [[Tour of Duty]]\n* LGR18 [[Feast of the Moon (LGR)|Feast of the Moon]]\n* LGR19 [[A Difference of Opinion]]\n* LGR20 [[The Howling of a Mighty Storm]]\n* LGR21 [[The Truth of Hearts]]\n* LGR22 [[As Seconds Slip Away]]\n* LGR23 [[Strange Bedfellows]] (unreleased) \n* LGR24 [[To Sever the Snake's Head]]\n* XGR5 [[Dominion of the Green King]]  (unreleased)",
