        "Description": "There were only a handful on [[Faer√ªn]] and their locations were unknown to all except certain [[elven high mage]]s. The gates' exact ages were unknown, but they predated even the coming of the [[dwarf|dwarves]]. The gates had the power to transport an individual to any point in the past, according to the wishes of the individual walking through. If no particular period in time was thought of, then the individual was transported to a random point in the past. The effect of walking through a gate was otherwise similar to the ''[[time conduit]]'' spell.",
        "History": "An expedition to locate the lost time gates was launched in [[404 DR]].",
        "Locations": {
            "First gate": "The first gate:\n{{Quote|''...lies hidden upon the back of the mountains, where the ice and rocks touch the summer sky of [[Amaunator]]'s belt.''}}\n[[Amaunator's belt]] was a constellation appearing in the summer over the [[Spine of the World]]. The gate was within a deep cave and was guarded by a vain and greedy [[white dragon]], who demanded a hefty fee to allow anyone past.",
            "Second gate": "The texts stated that the second gate was:\n{{Quote|''...north of [[Novularond]], shining bright upon [[Misken's Peak]] at [[Highsummer]].''}}\nMisken's Peak was since demolished by the [[Great Glacier]] and the portal buried beneath the ice.",
            "Third gate": "According to the texts, the third gate was on:\n{{Quote|''...Andrio's Peak near the Garden of Eldath.''}}\nThe name of the peak was a misspelling by a scribe and should have referred to [[Mount Andrus]]. The garden referred to [[Cedarsproke]], a city in the [[Gulthmere Forest]].",
            "Fourth gate": "There was another gate located in [[Synnoria]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]]. This was not referenced in Mystryl's texts like the others, and only ten elves ever spoke about the gate in thousands of years. Its physical form was of an arch situated in a cave at the eastern end of [[Mirror Lake]]."
