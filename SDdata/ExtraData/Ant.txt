==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Large swarms of ants could be found in the [[Crowded Sea]] region, on the island of [[Djinni's Claws]].

Like most mundane animals, ants could be found in the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]].<ref>
===Relationships===
The [[human]]s and [[wild dwarves]] that inhabited the lands of Chult and Tashlar were known to harvest and eat honey ants, except for during the winter season.

In the land of [[Semphar]], people were known to harvest large quantities of ants, douse them in [[herbs|herbed]] [[oil]]s, and then fry them into a sort of cake. The oil made it so that the ants would stick together into an easily movable mass. This custom was practiced during all but the winter season.{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-04-27 - Ant Entomophagy}}
