A '''mouse''' ({{Plural|mice}}) was a type of small rodent found in [[Faerûn]].

==Species==
* '''Badger mice:''' A species of mouse found in the [[Duskwood]]. Their name was derived from the fact that they were similar in size to small [[badger]]s. During the springtime in this forest there tended to be an abundance of ash wheat, which caused an increase in the badger mice population that was controlled by [[puff adder]]s.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Mice were quite common throughout [[the North]] and its [[Savage Frontier]]. In the [[Unapproachable East]], mice were common across the central plains of [[Rashemen]]. In [[west Faerûn]], mice could be found in the [[Forest of Mir]],<ref name=EotSS-pp81> the warmer areas of [[Calimshan]], as well as throughout both the [[Eastern Heartlands|Eastern]] and [[Western Heartlands]]. In [[southwest Faerûn]], they could be found in [[Tashalar]].

Beyond [[Faerûn]], mice were quite abundant on the island of [[Evermeet]], where they were hunted by [[gold elves]]. They could also be found in the [[Hordelands]] in the [[Katakoro Plateau]].

Beyond [[Toril]], mice could be found on the planets [[Chandos]] and [[Garden]].

==Trivia==
[[Ilmater]], the deity of suffering and martyrdom, could cause the appearance of field mice to indicate his favor or encourage his faithful.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts}}
