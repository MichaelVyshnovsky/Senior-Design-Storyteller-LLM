A '''couralitai''' was a scheduled meeting of the khans or princes of the people inhabiting the [[Hordelands]].

==History==
These meetings occurred every fall at the vale of [[Ejen Horo]], located between the [[Khopet-Dag|Khopet Dag Mountains]] and the [[Mountains of Copper]].

The couralitai was traditionally used to arrange marriages, settle feuds, determine blood prices for murders, and even to acknowledge a new khan. A khahan could also be elected during these meetings.
