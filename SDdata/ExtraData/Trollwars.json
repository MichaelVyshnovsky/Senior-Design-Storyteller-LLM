The trolls attacked the city that would become known as Waterdeep and were met with retaliation by forces led by Nimoar the Reaver, bearing his blazing spiked shield. The retaliatory forces burned large parts of the Evermoors, purging it of all trolls.\nThe Second Trollwar began in 940 DR and lasted until 952 DR.\nA third Trollwar almost took place in the Year of the Thundering Horde, 963 DR, when the traitors Aviss and Fellandar led an army of trolls out of the Mere of Dead Men against the city. The trolls were survivors of the earlier Trollwars and they believed the traitors could bring them victory in a third, and final, Trollwar, and so promised them power over the city. Aviss and Fellandar knew well the citys defenses, and Castle Waterdeep had only just begun construction. But Ahghairon and a band of wizards hurled Aviss and Fellandar into an extra-dimensional prison, thwarting the attack.\nGamebooks\nKnight of the Living Dead\nOrganized Play & Licensed Adventures\nHero of the Troll Wars\nFRGuerres des trolls\nCategoryWars\nCategoryBattles\nCategoryEvents in Waterdeep\nCategoryEvents in the Evermoors\nCategoryEvents in the Savage Frontier\nCategoryEvents on the Sword Coast North\nCategoryEvents in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryEvents in Faerûn\nCategoryEvents on Toril\nCategoryEvents\no0vqghuj65dpvxcs9vo833gj1gbkib8"
