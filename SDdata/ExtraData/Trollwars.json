        "First Trollwar": "The [[First Trollwar]] occurred in [[932 DR]], when a large population of trolls had been displaced from the [[Sword Mountains]] by [[orc]]s after they were united under the [[Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge]]. The trolls attacked the city that would become known as Waterdeep and were met with retaliation by forces led by [[Nimoar|Nimoar the Reaver]], bearing his [[Nimoar's blazing bulwark|blazing spiked shield]].{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 10}} The retaliatory forces burned large parts of the [[Evermoors]], purging it of all trolls.",
        "Second Trollwar": "The [[Second Trollwar]] began in [[940 DR]] and lasted until [[952 DR]].",
        "Third assault": "A third Trollwar almost took place in the [[963 DR|Year of the Thundering Horde, 963 DR]], when the traitors [[Aviss]] and [[Fellandar]] led an army of trolls out of the [[Mere of Dead Men]] against the city. The trolls were survivors of the earlier Trollwars and they believed the traitors could bring them victory in a third, and final, Trollwar, and so promised them power over the city. Aviss and Fellandar knew well the city's defenses, and [[Castle Waterdeep]] had only just begun construction. But Ahghairon and a band of [[wizard]]s hurled Aviss and Fellandar into an extra-dimensional prison, thwarting the attack.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City|16}}",
