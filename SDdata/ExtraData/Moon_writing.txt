Moon writing was a magical method of writing on paper or parchment that left the written word invisible to the naked eye, only being rendered visible when the material was struck from behind with moon light. Materials bearing moon writing radiated a magical aura. Sources differed on whether the spell read magic couldnt or could reveal moon writing.
Sometime in the 14 century DR, Vernon Condor, the Regent of the Exchequer in Ravens Bluff, sent a secret message in moon writing to a group of Ravenian adventurers he was hiring to retrieve the granite pedestal of The Menagerie as he was paranoid of interference from either the Red Wizards of Thay or the Zhentarim.
