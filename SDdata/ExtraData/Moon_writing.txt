'''''Moon writing''''' was a [[magic]]al method of writing{{Cite organized play/AG/Pillar of the Community|9}} on [[paper]] or [[parchment]] that left the written word invisible to the naked eye, only being rendered visible when the material was struck from behind with [[Sel√ªne (moon)|moon light]].

Sources differed on whether the [[spell]] ''[[read magic]]'' couldn't{{Cite organized play/AG/Pillar of the Community|10}} or could reveal ''moon writing''.

==History==
