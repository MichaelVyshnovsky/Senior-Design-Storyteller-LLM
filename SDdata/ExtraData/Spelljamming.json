        "Geography": "{{Main|Realmspace}}\nThe world of Toril was but one of several other worlds in the [[Realmspace]] crystal sphere. To the natives of [[Faerûn]], the wildspace above their heads was known as the Sea of Night. The two closest worlds to [[the sun]] in the middle of Realmspace were known as the [[Dawn Heralds]], and were barely visible only at sunset or sunrise. Beyond Toril, further out in the crystal sphere were the [[Five Wanderers]], five worlds that flowed through star-rivers in an uneven course through wildspace. Some of these worlds were inhabited by [[human]]s, [[dwarves]], and [[orc]]s, but also more sinister races such as [[illithid]]s and [[beholder]]s.",

            "Pre-Spellplague": "''Circa'' [[1367 DR]], the elves of [[Evermeet]] were said to have a half-dozen [[Ruathimaer]] (\"starwing\") spelljammer ships hidden in the [[Sumbrar]] fortress.\n\n[[File:Spelljammer-dragonship.png|thumb|left|250px|''A Shou [[dragonship]].'']]\nHowever, the real spelljammer powers on Toril were in [[Kara-Tur]]. Both the nation of [[Shou Lung]] and [[Wa]] were active in spelljamming.",
            "Post-Second Sundering": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a few rare [[mind flayer]] colonies still had their spelljamming vessels (the [[nautiloid]]s), but had lost the secrets of manufacturing them. They kept their existence hidden and only used their ships in case of emergency, in fear of being detected by [[Gith (race)|gith]] hunting parties."
