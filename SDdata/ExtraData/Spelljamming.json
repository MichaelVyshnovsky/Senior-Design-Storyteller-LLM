To the natives of Faerûn, the wildspace above their heads was known as the Sea of Night. The two closest worlds to the sun in the middle of Realmspace were known as the Dawn Heralds, and were barely visible only at sunset or sunrise. Beyond Toril, further out in the crystal sphere were the Five Wanderers, five worlds that flowed through star-rivers in an uneven course through wildspace. Some of these worlds were inhabited by humans, dwarves, and orcs, but also more sinister races such as illithids and beholders.\nIt was said that in the beginning Ao created a crystal sphere called the Sea of Night, which he created from the raw material of the phlogiston, the material between crystal spheres. Within this realm drifted several lifeless worlds, and it was from the remains of this creation process that two twin beings formed, one of dark (Shar) and one of light (Selûne). These two beings set in motion a series of events that resulted in life on these barren worlds.\nExactly when the natives of Toril themselves began to traverse wildspace was unknown, though for the elves it dated back to at least the era of Cormanthyr.\nthumb|A Monarch-class armada spelljammer ship.\nMiirphys Irithyl (reign  to ), an early coronal of the elven nation of Cormanthyr, was a supporter of the elven high mages desire to launch more spelljammer ships. The High Magic elaorman ritual was often used in the construction of the elven crystalline spelljammer ships, and was a requirement in the construction of the monarch spelljammer ships.\nThe reason that the elven high mages were so keen on creating more spelljammer ships was in order to counter the Netherese expansion into wildspace. The Netherese had been dabbling and exploring Realmspace for a while. The elves suspected that the Netherese discovered the magic of spelljamming as early as , though it was likely much earlier as the epic spell Proctivs breach crystal sphere was created in 1808 NY (−2051 DR).\nThe Netherese mage Oberon ( to ) was said to be the founder of Netherils spelljammer industry, the \"Father of Realmspace\" (or so his followers claimed at least). Oberon was born into the shipbuilding industry, his father having been a shipbuilder before him, and he dutifully followed in his fathers footsteps. Unlike him, though, he imbued his vessels with magic, and it was claimed that he led the other mages of Netheril into building spelljamming vessels. \nIt really wasnt until , however, that the Netherese officially launched themselves into wildspace with serious intent.\nHowever, the Netherese also found the expense of maintaining the docking stations and spelljammer ships too high and the danger too great, and they stopped all spelljamming activity in . The Elven Imperial Navy, a conglomeration of elven interests in space, much bigger in scope than just Cormanthyrs spacefaring, was said to have constantly harried the Netherese as well.\nDuring the Weeping War in , a series of short battles became known as the \"Three Greenwing Wars\" by the elves&mdashnamed as such for their ally, an elven man-o-war ship. The Elven Imperial Fleet of Realmspace sent the Monarch Mordent, a green-winged man-o-war spelljammer vessel captained by Oncith Ilbenalu. The Monarch Mordent provided heavy artillery and a crack crew of archers, bards, and wizards, which aided to briefly turn the tide of war in the northern forest. But in the last battle, the ship fell into the tree canopy below it. Its crystalline and photosynthetic wings continued to grow, however, and a large web of thin crystal grew to wrap around that part of the forest in what was later called the Monarchs Fall glade.\nCirca 1367 DR, the elves of Evermeet were said to have a half-dozen Ruathimaer (\"starwing\") spelljammer ships hidden in the Sumbrar fortress.\nthumb|left|250px|A Shou dragonship.\nHowever, the real spelljammer powers on Toril were in Kara-Tur. Both the nation of Shou Lung and Wa were active in spelljamming.\nIn the late 15 century DR, a few rare mind flayer colonies still had their spelljamming vessels (the nautiloids), but had lost the secrets of manufacturing them. They kept their existence hidden and only used their ships in case of emergency, in fear of being detected by gith hunting parties.\n* List of spelljamming terms\n* \nCategorySpelljamming terms\nchny124bs2scn1a8h54zm4gi8fuyntn"
