'''Herb''' was a broad term for a variety of plants used for medicinal purposes, crafting [[drug]]s and [[potion]]s, seasoning and garnishing food, providing aromas to food or fragrances, and a variety of other purposes.

Herbs were often dried, ground up into a powder, and tightly packed in order to preserve them. Some felt that herbs were best used when fresh, though their effectiveness often wasn't hindered by it.

Unlike [[spice]]s, caravans carrying herbs were only lightly guarded, as most monsters and [[humanoid]] tribes had little interest in stealing them.

==Availability==
Some professional healers bought their herbs, while others cultivated herb gardens to save currency and maintain a steady supply.

Apothecaries often sold raw and prepared herbs for medicinal and culinary purposes.
