However, they overplayed their hand, and their candidate, the shipwright [[Andramas Rujyntral]] , was rejected by the Lords. A flurry of assassinations among the Lords followed as the Xanathar's agents took their revenge and sought to eliminate rival candidates within the Lords and Rujyntral's most steadfast opponents, but this goaded various lords to hire adventurers to assassinate both Rujyntral and any of the Xanathar's agents they could identify and hunt down. They succeeded so well that the Xanathar not only lost Rujyntral, it suffered the loss of so many loyal human agents that it decided to retreat into the shadows, rebuilding its network with slow care and keeping well away from the Masked Lords (a policy that remained in force until a new Xanathar succeeded to the title).{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318744196308993| title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318745328758784| title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318746406707200 | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318747526647808 | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318748659101696  | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}\n\n: The Masked Lords endured a little more than three months without an Open Lord at the helm, until the ravages of the Spellplague demanded that their appointed spokesperson (Acting Voice of the Lords) Watchlord [[Phulundaera Vantur]] (a seasoned veteran who'd risen through the ranks; her much-scarred body incorporated magically-bonded limbs and organs from fallen comrades) be adopted as the New Open Lord. Phulundaera was street-wise and gruff and no-nonsense, and the guilds and just plain citizens of the streets loved her, because she stood for equality of treatment under city laws and policy, for the high and the low. This same quality made her detested by the nobles and 'wannabe nobles' nouveau riche, and they tried to arrange many accidents for her.{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318748659101696  | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318749695029248  | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318750907224065  | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318751989387264  | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}",
