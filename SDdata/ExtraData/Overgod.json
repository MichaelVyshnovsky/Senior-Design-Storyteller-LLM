        "Powers": "Overgods were more powerful than even [[greater deities]]; they had dominion over an entire [[crystal sphere]] and all the gods within it. Unlike normal gods, however, their influence was limited to a single sphere, and they had no power beyond it. It was said that they put all their power into maintaining their given sphere, and that perhaps they were its spirit made manifest.<ref group=\"note\">Despite being stated to be an overgod, Corellon was not restricted to a single sphere or location, instead being called \"overpower of the elvish race\". This, along with Asgorath being the god of dragons, potentially implies that this restriction was not universal.\n\nThe more gods under the dominion of an overgod, the stronger that overgod became, meaning those that wanted to grow almost always sought to invite new deities under their rule.\n\nIt may have been possible that gods of non-overgod status were capable of killing and/or overtaking overgods, but this was unclear.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum\n| title      = Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)\n| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]]/The Hooded One\n| topicid    = 13186\n| postid     = \n| whichpage  = 50\n| date       = 2010-06-16\n| accessdate = 2022-12-31\n}}",
        "Society": "Overpowers were not so much manipulators of the realms they controlled as guardians and vigils, watching out for the entire area within their influence. Terrible things could happen to the gods of a world if they didn't pay attention to the dictates of their overpower. However, this did not mean that they had to bend like straws to their commands, for the other deities had leverage of their own.\n\nDeities suffering under the rule of a despotic overpower might decide to simply leave, abandoning their responsibilities and mortals on their old world and taking their chances on other planes of existence. This was a big risk, for more [[pantheon]]s had died trying it than most gods would want to admit, but it was not an uncommon move for deities under tyrannical conditions. Given the correlation between an overgod's strength and the number of powers beneath them, it was in the best interest of overdeities to avoid desertation.",
        "Creation": "Not every crystal sphere had an overgod looking after it; some spheres spawned them while others did not for no apparent reason. It was possible that less powerful gods could rise to the station of overdeity.",
