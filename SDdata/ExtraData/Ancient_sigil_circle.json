        "Abilities": "When in use, a swirling black-and-violet vortex would form over the sigil. Anyone passing through the vortex would step directly to another sigil of their choosing, no matter the distance between them.\n\nIt was possible these sigil circles to malfunction. When this occurred, arcs of purple lightning would shoot out from the vortex. Individuals in transit could become 'stuck inside' the sigil, trapped unless someone else helped pull them through the vortex.",
        "History": "These sigils originated from the ancient empire of [[Netheril]].",
