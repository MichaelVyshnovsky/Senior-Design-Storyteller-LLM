Anyone passing through the vortex would step directly to another sigil of their choosing, no matter the distance between them.\nIt was possible these sigil circles to malfunction. When this occurred, arcs of purple lightning would shoot out from the vortex. Individuals in transit could become stuck inside the sigil, trapped unless someone else helped pull them through the vortex. \nThese sigils originated from the ancient empire of Netheril.\nThere were over three dozen of these ancient sigil circles found across the Western Heartlands and the region of the Sword Coast around Baldurs Gate.\n* Baldurs Gate (city sewers, Undercity, Wyrms Crossing)\n* Grymforge\n* Gauntlet of Shar\n* Moonhaven\n* Reithwin\n* Rosymorn Monastery"
