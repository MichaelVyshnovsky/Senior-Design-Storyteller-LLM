        "History": "The Centaur and the [[Woman Warrior]] came into full alignment, their swords crossing, in the summer of the [[1358 DR|Year of the Prince, 1358 DR]], in the evening as [[Waterdeep]] experienced the hottest day of the year. Meanwhile, unaware, [[Timoth Eyesbright]], a heroic centaur, and [[Vajra Valmeyjar]], a renowned warrior woman, had a protracted arm-wrestling contest in the [[Sel√ªne's Smile]] tavern. The cosmic alignment amplified the power of their contest, which merged with [[magic]] that had sweltered in the heat and tore a mystic nexus point into a rift. This opened a door to an extra-dimensional prison, releasing [[Aviss]] and [[Fellandar]] to wreak a path of destruction in the city. [[Khelben Arunsun]] urged Vajra and Timoth to continue arm-wrestling to hold the door open, before he hurled the villains back in. Vajra and Timoth broke off, closing the rift.{{Cite comic/Summer in the City}}"
