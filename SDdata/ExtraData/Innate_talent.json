        "mainbody": "nnate talents were unique abilities that awakened at first contact with magic.\nAnyone who was touched by magic for the first time had a small, 1 in a 100, chance of developing one such innate talent that chance was doubled for those who were the sole recipients of that magic. Those who were the progeny of two people with innate talents of their own had a 1 in 25 chance of possessing such a power, with a 1 in 100 chance that their magic would manifest at the time of their birth otherwise, it would awaken later in life at their first contact with magic at the normal rate.\nThese innate talents varied in frequency and reliability, and many were deleterious to use. Many of them were much like known spells such as clairaudience, detect good or evil, detect snares and pits, detect thoughts, ironguard, levitate, stone tell, telekinesis, temporal stasis, time stop, tree shape, or water walk. Other talents did not resemble known spells, being instead a perfect awareness of true north or the ability to deflect all spells or mental attacks, to see infrared, to locate water, to gain visions of objects handled, or to sometimes predict another creatures actions perfectly. Other abilities were akin to those granted by the great elixir. In rare cases, two talents coexisted, and every day one of them would be manifest. Talents were also known to change sometimes, or even fade away entirely after a few years.\nAccording to Volothamp Geddarm in Volos Guide to All Things Magical edited by Elminster, people who displayed such powers were always incapable of learning magic.\nKnowledge of innate talents was not shared freely by wizards, who were mostly not interested in testing the idle curious for powers developed upon contact with magic.\nSuch powers had been known since ancient times. During the late 14 century DR, the sage Eltrivyn of Candlekeep was studying such folk and offered them sanctuary in exchange for an opportunity to study them.\nTales about such powers often were about people who struck back at overbearing wizards with newfound powers in moments of great oppression. Many who developed such powers feared they may have been cursed, and were in turn feared as possible \"fiendkin\"."
