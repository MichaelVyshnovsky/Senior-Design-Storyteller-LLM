The '''Ven''' was the title of the ruler of the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]].

The Ven was elected by the members of the [[Council (Tsurlagol)|Council]], consisting of Tsurlagol's highest [[noble]]s and leading [[merchant]] lords, from among their number. Each Ven served for a 10-year term, in which their word was law, though unpopular Ven tended to die prematurely. Strangely, the true identity of the Ven was kept secret throughout their reign; it was an odd arrangement but apparently worked well for Tsurlagol.

The spokesperson of the Ven was the [[Ven's Voice]], who served as their chief advisor and announced the Ven's decrees to the people of Tsurlagol. However, the Voice was often more powerful than the Ven.
