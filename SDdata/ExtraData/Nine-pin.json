        "Description": "The gameplay of nine-pin involved rolling a polished ball down a {{SIAdj|60|ft|long=yes|adj=long}} lane to hit a formation of nine pins. Each player took turns as the 'bowler' and had two attempts to knock over the pins. A 'strike' was declared if a player knocked over all nine pins in one bowl, and a 'spare' was when they knocked all nine down after their second bowl. If the lane still had pins remaining after two bowls, an 'open' was declared.\n\nStrikes were worth 15 points, spares were worth 10 points, and a bowler who played an open received 1 point per knocked over pin. \n\nNine-pins required particular equipment to play. A bowler had to use a ball that was the right weight for them, and all players wore special shoes. The nine-pin alley in the Growling Groghouse was complete with a strong basket that caught balls and pins after they had been knocked over, and a bar that served drinks.\n\nUsing [[magic]] to influence the game was not necessarily against the rules.",
        "Notable Nine-Pin Players": "[[Halaster Blackcloak]] was particularly fond of nine-pin. He was a very competitive player, and took to insulting his opponents. He used the ''[[foresight]]'' spell to improve his chances at winning. When he beat someone in nine-pin, he forced them to serve him for a year and a day, transformed into a duplicate of himself. He put these duplicates to work in his nine-pin alley, cleaning and serving refreshments.",
