'''Truesight''' was a type of sense that only a small number of creatures possessed. Creatures with truesight could, out to a specific range, see in both normal and magical darkness. As well as that, they could see invisible creatures and objects and automatically see through visual [[illusion]]s (to reveal the original form of a creature or shapeshifter).

Those with truesight could also see into the [[ethereal plane]] within the same range of their normal truesight abilities.

==Spell==
Some [[mage]]s could cast ''[[true seeing]]'', giving them temporary access to this sense.
