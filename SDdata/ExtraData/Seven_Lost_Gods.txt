The '''"Seven Lost Gods"''', or simply the '''"Lost Gods"''', was a collective term used at different times for several different sets of [[deities]] and [[primordial]]s.{{Cite web enhancement/Westgate Timeline}} Numbering seven or even a host, they were of mysterious and ancient origin and caused disagreement and confusion among sages.

==The Seven Lost Gods of Antiquity==
The name "Seven Lost Gods" originated in ancient times, and properly included seven [[demipower]]s who were defeated by or submitted to the god [[Bane]], the Black Lord.{{Cite document

}} These were:
* [[Maram of the Great Spear]];
* [[Haask, Voice of Hargut|Haask, the Voice of Hargut]];
* [[Tyranthraxus|Tyranthraxus the Flamed One]];
* [[Borem of the Lake of Boiling Mud]];
* [[Camnod the Unseen]];
and two more whose names were lost to history.

These entities may have been [[primordial]]s, and other candidates included [[Dendar|Dendar the Night Serpent]] and [[Kezef|Kezef the Chaos Hound]].

In certain occult beliefs, one of the seven was slain by the mortal Bane, [[Bhaal]], and [[Myrkul]] as part of their apotheosis. Based on an inscription on a [[menhir]] on [[Mezeketh Isle]] discovered by [[Zembrath Klun]] in [[1359 DR]], Borem was the slain god.

==The Seven Lost Gods of Westgate==
A later "Seven Lost Gods" originated in [[Westgate]]. These were seven deities worshiped in the city prior to the Templeban Edict in the [[927 DR|Year of the Red Rain, 927 DR]], and comprised:
* [[Garagos]],
* [[Ghaunadaur]],
* [[Jergal]],
* [[Moander]],
* [[Savras]],
* [[Silvanus]],
and one more also lost to history.{{Cite dragon/428/Backdrop: Westgate|11}}

As a response to the ban, shrines to these Seven Lost Gods were established outside the city, on seven hills to the west, each topped with a ring of standing stones. The southernmost was the [[Hill of Fangs]], and was dedicated to Moander the Darkbringer. However, unknown to the common folk of Westgate, beneath many or even all of these hills were also secret underground temples to their respective gods. These shrines and temples were in use until the Templeban Edict was reversed in the [[1018 DR|Year of the Dracorage, 1018 DR]], and the hidden temples presumably lay undisturbed since that time. In time, the hills were called the Shrines of the Seven Lost Gods, even if some were still worshiped in the city once more.

However, much older stories of Westgate suggested that these same seven hills were used for religious practices before this time and went back much earlier, to before there was a Westgate and the area was an outpost of the empire of [[Jhaamdath]]. What gods or other forces were venerated here is unknown.{{Cite dragon/428/Backdrop: Westgate|12}}
