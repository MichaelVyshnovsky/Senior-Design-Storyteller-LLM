Near the time it was finished, it and Lavok disappeared for 500 years until it suddenly returned, re-appearing in the Slums District of Athkatla, vaporizing whatever matter existed where it appeared.\nA massive sphere, it was conceived and used as a vessel for planar travel. The sphere had complex engines, powered by the heart of a mighty demon (a tanarri). Inside, there were several rooms, among them a laboratory that contained a machine able to create a golem.\nSeveral athasian halflings occupied the sphere.\nCategoryArtifacts\nCategoryMobile locations\nCategoryPlaneshifting locations\nCategoryLocations in Athkatla\nCategoryLocations in Amn\nCategoryLocations in the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryLocations in West Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations on Athas\nCategoryLocations on Krynn\nqdwsytgcnz4ctz3aa0tquxg34bi7rg6"
