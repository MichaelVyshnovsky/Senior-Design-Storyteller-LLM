They were more common in the Upperdark than the Middledark.\nFungi were most abundant in Torils Underdark, where they and other vegetation received nourishment from the ambient faerzress. Areas particularly diverse in fungi included Fluvenilstra and Gduars Garden.\nThe year 238 DR was known as the \"Year of Many Mushrooms.\" During this time, prevalent damp weather and rotting diseases all across northern Faerûn promoted rampant growth of mushrooms. Trade in harvested mushrooms and mushroom-related products (especially fried ones in salted gravy) became prevalent, while reports of myconid sightings became more common.\nthumb|381x381px|A few fungi.\nThousands of species of fungi existed on Toril. Some of the known fungi on the planet included the following\n Acorn truffle  A species of edible fungus found along forest beds and favored by many wild beasts.\n Ascomoid  A very large, spherical fungus that typically rolled around and tried to crush its prey while spewing streams of spores out from its orifices.\n Araumycos  A very large fungal growth that lived in the Upper Northdark.\n Barrelstalk  A barrel-shaped fungus that usually held potable water but turned poisonous at maturity.\n Bluecap  Common in the Underdark.

For example, in the Hollowhar area of Silverymoon, mushroom and wine soup was popular and venison-and-mushroom broth and mushrooms in cream were specialties of Swordsfall House. The local dish thaevor potatoes included mushrooms of many kinds that were safe for consumption. Mushrooms made up the bulk of the diet of the inhabitants of Skullport. These mushrooms were sourced from mushroom farms in small outlying caverns and other levels of Undermountain.\nFungi, especially those purposely planted as beds or forests, had a wide variety of uses for drow depending upon their species, being used as a source of light, food, fiber for weaving, various medicines and oils, or a combination of these.\nSome master winemakers believed that stomping grapes barefoot was beneficial and even an intricate part of wine-making. Various funguses that grew on humanoid feet aided the fermentation process."
