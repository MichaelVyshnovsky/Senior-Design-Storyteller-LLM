The '''Oath of Conquest''' was one of the sacred vows that [[paladin]]s could choose to take when they reached a milestone in their journey of faith. When they dedicated themselves to the tenets of this oath, they also were granted access to a set of [[spell]]s at no cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).

==Oath of Conquest Spells==
Paladins new to this oath could cast ''[[armor of Agathys]]'', ''[[command]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', and ''[[spiritual weapon]]''. Skilled bearers of such an oath could cast ''[[bestow curse]]'', ''[[fear]]'', ''[[dominate beast]]'', and ''[[stoneskin]]''. Those that had proved themselves were even able to cast ''[[cloudkill]]'' and ''[[dominate person]]''.
