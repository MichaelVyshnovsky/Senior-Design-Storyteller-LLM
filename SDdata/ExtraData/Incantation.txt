The school of incantation contained spells that targeted magic itself and the way of casting it. Like other schools of effect, it thus grouped spells not like the traditional nine schools of magic based on their philosophy, but on what they affected.Cult of the Dragon does not call incantation a "school of effect", a term from Players Option Spells & Magic, but it fits the definition there.
Specialists in this school, called incantatrixes (or incantatars), were exceedingly rare. None were known outside of western Faer√ªn.
Incantation spells could be divided into four groups
*Banishment These spells were meant to send back magically summoned creatures.
*Disruptive Spells of this kind targeted magic already in place or the ability of another magic-user to cast spells.
*Metamagic These were spells that influenced the effectiveness of other spells, e.g. by changing their reach, area or intensity. 
*Shielding These were spells intended to protect a caster from anothers magic.
