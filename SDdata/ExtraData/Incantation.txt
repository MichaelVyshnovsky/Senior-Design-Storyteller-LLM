The '''school of incantation''' contained spells that targeted magic itself and the way of casting it. Like other [[schools of effect]], it thus grouped spells not like the traditional nine [[schools of magic]] based on their philosophy, but on what they affected.<ref group="note">''[[Cult of the Dragon (sourcebook)|Cult of the Dragon]]'' does not call incantation a "school of effect", a term from ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'', but it fits the definition there.

Specialists in this school, called [[incantatrix]]es (or incantatars), were exceedingly rare. None were known outside of western [[Faer√ªn]].

==Subschools==
Incantation spells could be divided into four groups:
*'''Banishment''': These spells were meant to send back magically summoned creatures.
*'''Disruptive''': Spells of this kind targeted magic already in place or the ability of another magic-user to cast spells.
*'''[[Metamagic]]''': These were spells that influenced the effectiveness of other spells, e.g. by changing their reach, area or intensity.<ref> 
*'''Shielding''': These were spells intended to protect a caster from another's magic.
