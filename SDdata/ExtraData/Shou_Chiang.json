Variants of it were used to write the languages of other nations of Kara-Tur.\nShou legends claimed that the written language was a gift to the early people of Shou Lung from the Celestial Emperor himself.\nShou Chiang was an alphabet with 24 unique characters. It was written from top to bottom and then left to right. Characters were intricate, but could be tailored to give different intonations and meanings to words.\nIt also had simple numeral system that was easily applied on mathematical tools such as the abacus.\nthumb|center|400px|Versions of the characters and numbers of Shou Chiang, with examples.The Shou Chiang characters shown in the Kara-Tur Trail Map are adapted from the modern English alphabet. Like many other fictional scripts, they have also a one-to-one correspondence, likely for gaming purposes. However, this adaptation creates a discrepancy this alphabet has 26 characters, but Shou Chiang has only 24. Writing appearing in other artwork in Kara-Tur sources, such as for the shan zi, shows different characters, but cannot always be confirmed to be Shou Chiang.\nWriting with the Shou Chiang alphabet was often a practice of artistry, involving calligraphy and color. As a reader would be more affected by a beautifully written piece of text, calligraphic writing was essential for decrees and poetry and a vital skill across Kara-Tur. In this calligraphy, type of paper, choice of color, dilution of ink, precise brush strokes, and speed of brushwork, as well as the purpose of the writing, were all vital. In calligraphy competitions, a more eloquent piece would lose out to a more artistic one. Red ink was reserved for important scrolls, after the red lightning that inscribed the Celestial Emperors teachings of the Path of Enlightenment in the Cliffs of Tanghai.\nMeanwhile, printing presses employing movable Shou Chiang type were used only for dry technical texts and bureaucratic work.\nSuch was their focus, a master scribe became lost in the act of writing and channeling the words of the Celestial Heavens. In particular, the runepriests known as shan zi (\"words of lightning\") developed their calligraphy into magical power, combat skill, and even the pursuit of enlightenment.\nShou Chiang was taught in schools and by monks of the Way and of the Path of Enlightenment to any who wished it.\n* Shou Chiang languages\nCategoryScripts\n7zhslbpwv7s3pc3typfa4104ezxmhym"
