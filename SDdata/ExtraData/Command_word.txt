A '''command word''', or a trigger word, was a word that needed to be spoken aloud to activate a magical effect.  A command word or words could be any word, though common words were often avoided so as to avoid activating a magical effect accidentally. Often a command word was a seemingly nonsensical word or a word from an ancient language.

In the time after the fall of [[Myth Drannor]], it was common for several centuries to hide a command word inside a more easily memorized phrase. However, this fell out of use after too many magics were unintentionally activated. In the 1300s DR, command words were best described as elegant nonsense.

Overwords were command words that could activate many magical effects, [[spell]]s, or items.  Several wizards attempted to learn these words and [[chapbook]]s of them were sold at every [[Mage Fair]].

The spells ''[[identify]]'' and ''[[analyze dweomer]]'' could both reveal command words.

==Magic Items==
Many [[magical item]]s needed command words to activate them.
