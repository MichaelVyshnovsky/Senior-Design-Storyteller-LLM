Its teachings centered on equality, both among people and animals, and provided a set of moral guidelines and a sense of social ethos.\nThe Iulutiuns were a pragmatic people who had a hard time believing anything they could not see or hear for themselves they consequently had no belief in gods. Qukoku was a more pragmatic alternative rooted in the everyday lives of the Iulutiun people.\nThe root principle of qukoku was that all living creatures possessed eaas, an unknowable essence of life that disappeared in death. An individuals eaas compelled them to act a certain way for example, a seals eaas was expressed differently to that of a human. At the same time, all living creatures had the same capacity for thought, emotion, and morals&mdasheaas simply caused these to be expressed differently. Since eaas was unknowable, qukoku dictated that all individuals were equal and deserved respect, including animals.\nEaas also dictated an individuals place in the natural order. It was therefore morally right for humans to eat animals, and for animals to eat other animals, and so on. At the same time, disrespectful and needless killing disrupted the natural balance. In such cases, nature rebalanced itself by visiting disease and disaster on humans to reduce their eaas.\nAlthough qukoku was not a religion, the philosophy had many associated rituals intended to celebrate the unity of nature and respect for life. Iulutiuns observed most of these rituals, while Angulutiuns placed less emphasis on the liqukoku and utqukoku rituals.\nIulutiun children were presented with a bone or wood carving of an animal, such as a caribou or a seal. These carvings were given by a friend of the childs parents with the intent of passing on some of the animals traits onto the child.\nThe qukoku new year began on the first day of spring. This was observed through liqukoku, a ritual celebrating the killing of the years first caribou, seal, and polar bear. The skin of each animal was hung on a  liqukoku pole for an entire week all adult villagers paid their respects to the animal by bowing before the pole. For the duration of the week, the hunter of each animal wore a hide mask representing the animal they had killed. The hunters were also disallowed from eating the meat of the animal they had killed. This lasted for a month if the animal was male, and two months if it was female.\nAccording to qukoku, an individuals eaas resided in their skull. The opoqukoku ritual concerned the respectful disposal of skulls, especially those that could not be repurposed for practical use, such as bowls or cups. Opoqukoku involved burying skulls in a deep pit or throwing them into the sea. This applied not only to domestic or butchered animals, but also corpses found in the wilderness. Opoqukoku was a matter of grave importance to the Iulutiuns and Angulutiuns transgressions were sometimes punished by execution.\nEqukoku was the qukoku ritual honoring the dead&mdashthis was primarily intended for humans, but was also sometimes staged to honor a beloved pet or a wild animal worthy of respect. Equkoku was a feast intended only for the immediate family of the deceased (or, in the case of hunted animals, a few friends of the hunter). The deceased was placed at the table on top of a slab ice blocks and covered with furs for warmth. A lamp was placed near their head so they could see, and a bowl and cup was placed at their side so they could eat. These were symbolic gestures intended mainly to comfort the grieving family&mdashIulutiuns and Angulutiuns did not believe the deceased needed any of these things.\nThe customs following the feast varied from village to village. Some buried their dead, others burned them, while others sunk them to the bottom of the sea. All villages maintained cemeteries where equkoku totems were placed. These were approximately  tall, cylindrical in shape, and made from tree and bone, with their heads carved to resemble the deceased. These cemeteries never contained any actual bodies.\nThis ritual celebrating the bond between humans and caribou was unique to the Angulutiun people. Taatquoko was observed at the beginning of each ikili&mdashthe yearly migration of a villages caribou herd. All adults would gather with the herd outside the village, singing and dancing while the caribou herders would don two-faced taatquoko masks (displaying caribou and human faces, symbolizing their unity) while they performed a special dance.\n* Inum, renowned Iulutiun philosopher\nCategoryPhilosophies\nCategoryOther Religions\nokbj2ktzpxe8chrvbofcaoen03e37re"
