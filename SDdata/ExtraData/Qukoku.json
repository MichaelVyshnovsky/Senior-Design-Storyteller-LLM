These carvings were given by a friend of the child's parents with the intent of passing on some of the animal's traits onto the child.\n\n===Liqukoku===\nThe ''qukoku'' new year began on the first day of spring. This was observed through ''liqukoku'', a ritual celebrating the killing of the year's first caribou, seal, and [[polar bear]]. The skin of each animal was hung on a {{SI|10|ft}} ''liqukoku'' pole for an entire week; all adult villagers paid their respects to the animal by bowing before the pole. For the duration of the week, the hunter of each animal wore a hide mask representing the animal they had killed. The hunters were also disallowed from eating the meat of the animal they had killed. This lasted for a month if the animal was male, and two months if it was female.\n\n===Opoqukoku===\nAccording to ''qukoku'', an individual's ''eaas'' resided in their skull. The ''opoqukoku'' ritual concerned the respectful disposal of skulls, especially those that could not be repurposed for practical use, such as bowls or cups. ''Opoqukoku'' involved burying skulls in a deep pit or throwing them into the sea. This applied not only to domestic or butchered animals, but also corpses found in the wilderness. ''Opoqukoku'' was a matter of grave importance to the Iulutiuns and Angulutiuns; transgressions were sometimes punished by execution.\n\n===Equkoku===\n''Equkoku'' was the ''qukoku'' ritual honoring the dead&mdash;this was primarily intended for humans, but was also sometimes staged to honor a beloved pet or a wild animal worthy of respect. ''Equkoku'' was a feast intended only for the immediate family of the deceased (or, in the case of hunted animals, a few friends of the hunter). The deceased was placed at the table on top of a slab ice blocks and covered with furs for warmth. A lamp was placed near their head so they could see, and a bowl and cup was placed at their side so they could eat. These were symbolic gestures intended mainly to comfort the grieving family&mdash;Iulutiuns and Angulutiuns did not believe the deceased needed any of these things.\n\nThe customs following the feast varied from village to village. Some buried their dead, others burned them, while others sunk them to the bottom of the sea. All villages maintained cemeteries where ''equkoku'' totems were placed. These were approximately {{SI|3|ft}} tall, cylindrical in shape, and made from tree and bone, with their heads carved to resemble the deceased. These cemeteries never contained any actual bodies.\n\n===Taatquoko===\nThis ritual celebrating the bond between humans and caribou was unique to the Angulutiun people. ''Taatquoko'' was observed at the beginning of each ''ikili''&mdash;the yearly migration of a village's caribou herd. All adults would gather with the herd outside the village, singing and dancing while the caribou herders would don two-faced ''taatquoko'' masks (displaying caribou and human faces, symbolizing their unity) while they performed a special dance.",
        "Foundational Principles": "The Iulutiuns were a pragmatic people who had a hard time believing anything they could not see or hear for themselves; they consequently had no belief in gods. ''Qukoku'' was a more pragmatic alternative rooted in the everyday lives of the Iulutiun people.\n\nThe root principle of ''qukoku'' was that all living creatures possessed ''eaas'', an unknowable essence of life that disappeared in death. An individual's ''eaas'' compelled them to act a certain way; for example, a [[seal]]'s ''eaas'' was expressed differently to that of a [[human]]. At the same time, all living creatures had the same capacity for thought, emotion, and morals&mdash;''eaas'' simply caused these to be expressed differently. Since ''eaas'' was unknowable, ''qukoku'' dictated that all individuals were equal and deserved respect, including animals.\n\n''Eaas'' also dictated an individual's place in the natural order. It was therefore morally right for humans to eat animals, and for animals to eat other animals, and so on. At the same time, disrespectful and needless killing disrupted the natural balance. In such cases, nature rebalanced itself by visiting disease and disaster on humans to reduce their ''eaas''.",
