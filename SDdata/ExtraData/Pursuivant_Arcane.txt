A '''Pursuivant Arcane''' was a mage on a mission from Mystra, granted secret powers.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|122}}

==Powers==
While acting as a pursuivant arcane, a mage could take ''[[wraithform]]'' once a tenday for half an hour.

They also gained six free spells daily. They could cast any spell they knew as such a free spell, without choosing ahead of time or memorizing; their only limitation was that they could use only two attack spells, two defensive spells, and two divination spells a day.

Finally, they could talk to [[Azuth]] or [[Mystra]], asking them to manifest. Doing this without a pressing reason was a bad idea, however, and even saving one's life wasn't always good enough a reason.

==Secrecy==
A Pursuivant Arcane who announced their status lost it immediately, manifesting a ring of black flames as a visual marker.
