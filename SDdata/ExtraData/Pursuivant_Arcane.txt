A Pursuivant Arcane was a mage on a mission from Mystra, granted secret powers.
While acting as a pursuivant arcane, a mage could take wraithform once a tenday for half an hour.
They also gained six free spells daily. They could cast any spell they knew as such a free spell, without choosing ahead of time or memorizing their only limitation was that they could use only two attack spells, two defensive spells, and two divination spells a day.
Finally, they could talk to Azuth or Mystra, asking them to manifest. Doing this without a pressing reason was a bad idea, however, and even saving ones life wasnt always good enough a reason.
A Pursuivant Arcane who announced their status lost it immediately, manifesting a ring of black flames as a visual marker.
