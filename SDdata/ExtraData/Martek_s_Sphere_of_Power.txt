Marteks Sphere of Power was the tool which Martek prophesised would have to be released so that the efreeti Pasha Khalitharius would be banished from Raurin forever. Though it was assumed to be an artifact, there was no such device it was actually Martek himself.
According to legend, Martek had used the Sphere of Power to defeat Khalitharius in a magical battle, and that it had been buried with him.
There were references to Marteks Sphere of Power in an epic known by Roland the Minstrel, and the wizard Trifakas had come to the Tomb of Martek to acquire it. the Obelisk in the middle of Medinat Muskawoon also made reference to it.
