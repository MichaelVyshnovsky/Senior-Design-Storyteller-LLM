The Oath of Redemption was one of the sacred vows that paladins could choose to take when they reached a milestone in their journey of faith. When they dedicated themselves to the tenets of this oath, they also were granted access to a set of spells at no cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).
Paladins that had recently taken such as oath could cast sanctuary, sleep, calm emotions, as well as hold person. Adept paladins could cast counterspell, hypnotic pattern, Otilukes resilient sphere, stoneskin. Very versed bearers of such an oath could cast hold monster and wall of force.
