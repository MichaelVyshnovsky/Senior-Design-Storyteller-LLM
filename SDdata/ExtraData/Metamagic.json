Metamagic allowed casters to transcend the normal rules of magic and create effects that could be devastatingly powerful.\nThe term metamagic was also used for a group of spells that affected the workings of other spells to the same purpose. It was considered a sub-school of the school of incantation.\nMetamagic allowed spellcasters to augment their abilities in amazing ways.  \nThe action increased the intensity of harmful spells.\nMaterial spell components were not required when using this skill.\nThis skill allowed to cast a spell with double its usual duration.\nBy sacrificing access to a stronger spell, the caster could cast a weaker spell at will without having to re-memorize the spell.\nThis skill unleashed the full potential of harmful spells.\nSpellcasters with this skill could cast spells quicker, allowing them to cast more spells during the same time period, or cast a single spell before performing another action.\nSilent Spell allowed spellcasting without the necessary vocalisations, or even by willpower alone.\nBy sacrificing access to a stronger spell, the caster could cast a weaker spell without needing to consult a spellbook.\nThis skill allowed the caster to cast a spell without the requisite gestures.\nThis skill allowed the caster to draw spells from memory instead of consuming charges when using a magical item.\nCategoryMagic\ns9w1huj1z12hpxqy6g3w5hqq6f0ge4b"
