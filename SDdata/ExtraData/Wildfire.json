People who exhibited signs of wildfire were always native residents of Ravens Bluff who had no formal training in the arcane arts. The warlord Myrkyssa Jelan discovered the reason for this a wild mythal, built by the dark elves below the city. The mythals magic seeped into the air, earth, and water surrounding Ravens Bluff, and was the source of wildfire.\nIn the 1370s DR, Myrkyssa sought multiple times to conquer or seize control of the city of Ravens Bluff and thus exploit the wild mythal to aid her future conquests.\nUnfortunately for Jack, the House of High Magic, a local mage guild, divined that Jacks wildfire would bring some sort of magical calamity (possibly the Spellplague) to Ravens Bluff so they imprisoned Jack in magical stasis inside the mythal stone. He didnt escape until over a hundred years had passed.\nThe destruction of the wild mythal in the , resulted in Jack losing his magical abilities.\n* Jack Ravenwild\nCategoryMagic\nCategoryEvents in Ravens Bluff\nCategoryEvents in the Vast\nCategoryEvents in North Faerûn\nCategoryEvents in Faerûn\nCategoryEvents on Toril\nCategoryEvents\nh77nhqzza1khhyowcmydzutqhm8lzgb"
