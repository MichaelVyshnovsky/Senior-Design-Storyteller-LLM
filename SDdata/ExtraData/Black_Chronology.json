        "mainbody": "'''Black Chronology''', also known as the '''Shadow Roll''', was an alternate prophecy by the Lost Sage, [[Augathra the Mad]], who penned the [[Roll of Years]]. In addition to her daytime visions that were recorded in the Roll of Years, she experienced dark visions at night while sleeping and these she wrote down in a book that eventually became known as the ''[[Book of the Black]]''. She believed that the goddess [[Shar]] was the source of these revelations and that they were part of a plan by the Dark Goddess to destroy the [[Weave]] and its embodiment, [[Mystryl]].",
        "History": "Augathra began having her nightmarish visions around {{Yearlink|-400}} and they propelled her to wander [[Toril]], slowly driving her insane. The sages of the Dark Diviners studied the tome and thought they discovered a weakness or vulnerability in Shar's plans or perhaps the goddess herself at some point in the future, and they recorded their deciphering of the ''Book'' in their own tome called ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]''. When Shar learned of this, she cursed both books to be illegible and then had her followers steal both works.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, [[adventurer]]s investigating a [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|false temple]] of [[Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]] eventually traveled to the [[Monastery of the Ebon Dome]] on the [[Plane of Shadow]]. There, they confronted and defeated the [[Cyricist]] Skull Servant, [[Bineera Ethar]]. On her person, they found an unfinished letter to her superior, Blackwill [[Haarken Akhmelere]], and a piece of parchment that purportedly contained the first thirty-four years of the Black Chronology and, more importantly, the matching names from the Roll of Years.",
        "A Portion of the Black Chronology": "The scrap of parchment believed to have been written by a Sharran [[monk]] of the Monastery of the Ebon Dome contained the following list:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
