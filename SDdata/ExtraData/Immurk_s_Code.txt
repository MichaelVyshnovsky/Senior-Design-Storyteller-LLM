Immurks Code was a set of pirate traditions and codes of conduct established by the famed pirate Immurk.
Immurks Code was the closest thing to a set of laws, aside from roving gangs of thug law enforcers, used within the city of Immurks Hold on Dragonisle in the Pirate Isles.
The points of Immurks Code are outlined below
* Immurks Hold would remain open to all pirates for as long as they did not prey upon other pirates.
* The hard life of a pirate was governed by the gods. Worship of all gods was tolerated within the city.
* Everyone in the city was required to aid in its defense during an attack. Everyone was required to learn how to fight and maintain their own weapon of choice.
* Disputes between pirate captains were to occur outside of the city.
