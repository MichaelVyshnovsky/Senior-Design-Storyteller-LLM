The Compact of Yuireshanyaar was an agreement between the elves of Sildëyuir and those of the Yuirwood. Amongst other things, it forbid Yuirwood elves from establishing themselves too close to the megaliths leading to Sildëyuir. Kiril Duskmourn slew several young elves in the early-to-mid 1360s DR, under the influence of Angul, for breaching the compact.
