'''Spellfire''' was a form of [[raw magic]], being the raw energy of the [[Weave]] and a very rare [[Magic|magical]] power.

==Usage==
It was highly coveted by many in [[Faer√ªn]], as it allowed the user to absorb [[spell]]s cast at them, and, in rare cases, for a powerful ability known as the [[Crown of Fire (spell)|Crown of Fire]].

==Description==
Spellfire usually appeared as a font of silver light and healing energy. When used in battle, it looked like a radiant blue-white flame. For a long time, the ability to control spellfire was believed to be unique to a single person each generation, but that was a fallacy: most wielders simply chose to hide their ability in order to avoid getting noticed by powerful organizations such as the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==Known Spellfire Wielders==
The bearers of lesser and true spellfire include:
* [[Shandril Shessair]]
* [[Dammasae]] the [[Incantatrix]], mother of Shandril
* [[Baerendra Riverhand]]
* [[Haelam Sunderstone]]
* [[Iliph Thraun]]
* [[Myrjala Talithyn]]
* [[Shoulree Talaeth]]{{cite book/Spellfire/Paperback 1988|255|12}}
* [[Elminster Aumar]]
* [[Khelben Arunsun]]

As of [[1372 DR]], other wielders of true spellfire were reported to be a mage in hiding in the [[Border Kingdoms]], a noble of [[Chessenta]] known for their cruelty and arrogance, and a [[wizard]] whose name begins with "R".

== Spellfire versus Silver Fire==
While both spellfire and [[silver fire]] originated from the raw energy of the Weave, they didn't have exactly the same effect. Spellfire was pure raw energy, while silver fire was a power granted to the [[Chosen of Mystra]] to channel the Weave's energy in a more subtle way.{{Cite web|url= https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1385630069977227269 |title= Ed Greenwood on Twitter |accessdate=2021-10-27 |author= [[Ed Greenwood]] |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2021-04-23 |year=2021 |month=04 |format= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}<ref group="note">This silver fire may be the same as lesser spellfire, as most of Mystra's Chosen are stated to have only lesser spellfire on page 56 of ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition''.
