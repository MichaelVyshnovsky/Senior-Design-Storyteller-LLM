Thunderbelly, the Iron Arm of Dardath was a dwarf soldier who participated in the last Illefarn battle against the King of Shadows. Before the battle, he swore an oath to not rest before the King was dead, and so awoke to find himself trapped in the gem mines in the ruined city of Arvahn along with other spirits connected to the King. His spirit helped an adventurer uncover one of the statues needed for the Ritual of Purification, designed to weaken the King of Shadows. Thunderbelly got his name from his boisterous stomach during one particular battle, his gut would produce loud, hungry noises while he battled trolls (he had missed breakfast that morning).
