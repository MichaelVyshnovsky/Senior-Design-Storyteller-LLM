'''Thunderbelly, the Iron Arm of Dardath''' was a [[dwarf]] soldier who participated in the last [[Illefarn]] battle against the [[King of Shadows]]. Before the battle, he swore an oath to not rest before the King was dead, and so awoke to find himself trapped in the [[gem mines]] in the ruined city of [[Arvahn]] along with other spirits connected to the King. His spirit helped an adventurer uncover one of the statues needed for the [[Ritual of Purification]], designed to weaken the King of Shadows. Thunderbelly got his name from his boisterous stomach; during one particular battle, his gut would produce loud, hungry noises while he battled [[troll]]s (he had missed breakfast that morning).
