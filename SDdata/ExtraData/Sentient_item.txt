Sentient items or Intelligent items were magical items that possessed a degree of intelligence and sentience. A tiny fraction (less than one percent) of the magical items created throughout history had actual intelligence. They had alignments, could bestow additional powers on their user, and could even have enough of an ego (a key quality of these creations) to choose who was worthy to use them.
