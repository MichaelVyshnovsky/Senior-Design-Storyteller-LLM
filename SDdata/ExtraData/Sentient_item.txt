'''Sentient items''' or '''Intelligent items''' were [[magical item]]s that possessed a degree of intelligence and sentience. A tiny fraction (less than one percent) of the magical items created throughout history had actual intelligence. They had [[alignment]]s, could bestow additional powers on their user, and could even have enough of an ego (a key quality of these creations) to choose who was worthy to use them.

==Notable Sentient Items==
* [[Crenshinibon]]
* [[Khazid'hea]]
* [[Charon's Claw (sword)|Charon's Claw]]
*[[Enserric the Longsword]]
