The '''Cabal of Madness''' was an alliance of [[Imaskari]] [[archmage]]s in pursuit of power without limits. They gained the knowledge of how to build artifacts from horrors beyond their world, and over decades, constructed several devices of such power, [[mask (object)|masks]] known as the ''[[Faces of Madness]]''. The masks were finished before {{yearlink|-2488}}, but not soon enough to allow the Cabal to carry out its plans: the [[Mulan]] rebelled, bolstered by the powers of their pantheons arriving that year. The masks became lost in the resulting tumult.{{Cite dragon/281/Bazaar of the Bizarre: Imaskarcana: Faces of Magic}}
