The Rule of Dragons  was a period in Abeirs history when dragons consolidated their rule in the continent of Laerakond.
After the War of Fang and Talon, a mighty dragon called Gorloun founded the first dragon empire, and soon rival draconic realms sprang up thereafter. These nations quarreled each other for ages, but draconic rule remained nearly unchallenged until the Blue Breath of Change, when Laerakond and other regions of Abeir were transported to Toril, and the fate of the world of Abeir became a mystery to Faer√ªnian sages.
