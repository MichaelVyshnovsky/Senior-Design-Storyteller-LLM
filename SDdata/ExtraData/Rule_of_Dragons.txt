The '''Rule of Dragons'''  was a period in [[Abeir]]'s history when [[dragon]]s consolidated their rule in the continent of [[Laerakond]].

==Description==

After the [[War of Fang and Talon]], a mighty dragon called [[Gorloun]] founded the first dragon empire, and soon rival draconic realms sprang up thereafter. These nations quarreled each other for ages, but draconic rule remained nearly unchallenged until the [[Spellplague|Blue Breath of Change]], when Laerakond and other regions of Abeir were transported to [[Toril]], and the fate of the world of Abeir became a mystery to [[Faer√ªn]]ian sages.
