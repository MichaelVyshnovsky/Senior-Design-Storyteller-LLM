However, generally, those who were good often worried about their errors and would try to repair damage, if they had caused any. Inhabitants who focused on the pursuit of good, especially helping others, with no particular regard for law or chaos were known as neutral good. Good inhabitants who swore by law and order, particularly paladins, were known as lawful good.\nSome interpreted good inhabitants as those who practiced altruism, protection of life, and personal sacrifice. Others interpreted good people as those who believed that protecting and helping those in need, or those who are too weak to act for themselves, was the right thing to do.\nthumb|right|273px|An avatar of Lathander, the goodly god of the dawn and renewal, holds a newborn.\n* Archons were lawful good beings that protected those who were free of evil.\n* Celestials were being that were almost always good, whether they be lawful good, neutral good, or chaotic good.\n* Many types of elves tended towards being chaotic good, such as moon elves, who were very tolerant of other races.\n* Tyr, a lawful good deity and the leader of the Triad.\n* Lathander, a neutral good deity of the dawn.\n* Sel√ªne, a chaotic good deity who opposed her evil twin, Shar."
