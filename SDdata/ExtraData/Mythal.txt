right|thumb|280px|Mages raising a mythal.
A mythal was a powerful magical effect, created by a group of spellcasters to protect and ward a large area with numerous powerful enchantments. The earliest mythals were created by a circle of elven High Mages. Mythals could permanently alter the Weave to create an area wherein the normal rules of magic no longer applied. A typical mythal prevented certain schools of magic from being employed while empowering others. It could restrict access to the warded area to certain classes of beings. For example, Silverymoons mythal excluded evil dragons. Creation of a mythal sometimes required the willing sacrifice of the lead casters life, a result that led to the first mythal being named after its creator. In addition, many mythal spells corroded over time, and if not maintained could become corrupted. This occurred in Myth Drannor and resulted in the state of that city until 1374 DR.
The god of mythals, Mythrien Sarath, was said to have invested much of his divine power in helping elven High Mages erect their mythals.
While any epic magic "field or ward" could be considered a mythal the differences were often in semantics or traditions, but scholars often used the following distinctions to describe various mythals
* High Mythal or True Mythal The first, great elven mythals.
* Wizard Mythal Those mythals created later but with similar power and often by/including non-elves.
* House Mythal A minor mythal that covered a building.
Part of the confusion came from the fact that, prior to Mystras Ban, mythals could be created by both high-level spells and epic magic. After Mystras Ban, only the epic magic option remained.
* Dracorage mythal Destroyed in 1373 DR.
