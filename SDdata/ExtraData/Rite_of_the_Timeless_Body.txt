The Rite of the Timeless Body was an esoteric druidic ritual used to prolong a learned and powerful druids lifespan beyond what was natural for their race.
To a casual observer, the scroll containing the Rite of the Timeless Body appeared to be a confusing collection of strange symbols and sketches. The scroll prepared by the High Harper of Baldurs Gate, Jaheira, was a chaotic collection of druidic scripts and sketches carefully notated but incomplete.
By the , Jaheira had spent years but eventually acquired the rare and obscure ritual and deciphered its steps and components. Being a half-elf of over a century in age, she was torn between the desire to continue her work for the betterment of the Gate and coming to terms with her age and eventual end. Jaheira kept the rituals scroll in her private and secure sanctuary an underground house and a small cave underneath her home in the Lower City. As the Absolute crisis concluded, Jaheira was at peace with her story, eventually receiving an ending, but just not yet. She hoped that the new generation of heroes would carry the torch and continue protecting the Gate.
