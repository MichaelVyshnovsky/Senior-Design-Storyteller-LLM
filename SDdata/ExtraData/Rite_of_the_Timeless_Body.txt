The '''''Rite of the Timeless Body''''' was an esoteric [[druid]]ic ''[[ritual]]'' used to prolong a learned and powerful druid's lifespan beyond what was natural for their race.
{{quote|It is every [[Harper]]'s hope to be a light that drives out darkness. But I've lived long enough to see so many of those lights burn out, while the shadows cling stubbornly on. Knowing that – isn't it our duty to burn on if we can? To fight for as long as we are able? I spent most of my life fighting those who tried to escape their end. [[Ketheric]], [[Irenicus]], [[Sarevok]]... that is not company I would like to keep. In truth, I had put this ritual from my mind – until [[Last Light]]. Trapped in that darkness, I turned to my research again: what if I was a little stronger? As fast as I once had been?|High Harper Jaheira}}

==Description==
To a casual observer, the scroll containing the ''Rite of the Timeless Body'' appeared to be a confusing collection of strange symbols and sketches. The scroll prepared by the [[High Harper]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Jaheira]], was a chaotic collection of druidic scripts and sketches carefully notated but incomplete.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Jaheira had spent years but eventually acquired the rare and obscure ritual and deciphered its steps and components. Being a [[half-elf]] of over a century in age, she was torn between the desire to continue her work for the betterment of the Gate and coming to terms with her age and eventual end. Jaheira kept the ritual's [[scroll]] in her private and secure sanctuary: an underground house and a small cave underneath her home in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]]. As the [[Absolute crisis]] concluded, Jaheira was at peace with her story, eventually receiving an ending, but just not yet. She hoped that the new generation of heroes would carry the torch and continue protecting the Gate.
