The '''Tessarch''' was the second-highest-rank member of the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]], and later the [[Council of Five (Amn)|Council of Five]], the governing bodies that ruled the nation of [[Amn]] during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. By [[1479 DR]], the title was regularly held by members of the [[Dannihyr]] family of [[Eshpurta]].

==Responsibilities==
The Tessarch oversaw the judicial branch of the [[Amn]]ian government, and served as the council's contact when dealing with the [[:Category:Amnian houses|noble families]] of Amn. They oversaw the local magistrates who ruled the towns and cities across the nation, intervening when "family business" got out of control, and had to be handled by the council. By the 15{{th}} century, they were the secret authority charged with overseeing the activities of the [[Shadow Thieves]].

==Members==
* [[Quorl Vemmil]] ([[1333 DR]] – [[1345 DR]])
* [[Erlranther Alibakkar]] (1345 DR – [[1362 DR]])
* [[Phaan Colwyvv]] (1362 DR - ?)
