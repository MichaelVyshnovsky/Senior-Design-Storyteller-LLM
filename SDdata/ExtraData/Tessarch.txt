The Tessarch was the second-highest-rank member of the Council of Six, and later the Council of Five, the governing bodies that ruled the nation of Amn during the 14 and 15 centuries DR. By 1479 DR, the title was regularly held by members of the Dannihyr family of Eshpurta.
The Tessarch oversaw the judicial branch of the Amnian government, and served as the councils contact when dealing with the noble families of Amn. They oversaw the local magistrates who ruled the towns and cities across the nation, intervening when "family business" got out of control, and had to be handled by the council. By the 15 century, they were the secret authority charged with overseeing the activities of the Shadow Thieves.
