        "mainbody": "The Articles of the Compact were an agreement between the various Lords of the towers on Forevers Edge, added after the Traitor was discovered to be in the service of the Far Realm. They allowed any of the Lords to search any other Lords tower, basically at will.\nThey were invoked in  by the Lords Dramvar and Eloar of the Spire of Summers Mist to investigate the Spire of Winters Peace, because of the Lady of the Tower, Malyanna, had been missing for an extended time. This made Taal, her castellan, murder them."
