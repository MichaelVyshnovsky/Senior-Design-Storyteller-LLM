        "Description": {
            "Restrictions": "Time travel was strictly regulated by deities of the [[Realms]]. In the ages before and up to the [[fall of Netheril]], [[Mystryl]], the ancient goddess of time and magic, allowed no being to change the \"stream of time\". This law generally held, save for a single manner of her choosing, the ''[[time conduit]]'', and was omniscient to any anomalous events that attempted to bypass her law. \n\nLimitations on time travel continued under the goddess' successors, the two incarnations of [[Mystra]], and her allies [[Oghma]] and [[Deneir]], for at least the next 1700 years. It was unknown what role if any [[Chronos]], the [[Orva]]n god of time, played in this role.{{Template:Cite book/Four from Cormyr|79}}\n\nIt was impossible for a being to travel in time on another [[plane of existence]], specifically the [[Demiplane of Time]], and then return to the [[crystal sphere]] of the planet [[Toril]], or its predecessor [[Abeir-Toril]].",
            "Consequences": "Many [[sage]]s believed that if an individual altered a crucial or decisive event, they could alter the \"stream of time\" and begin the formation of a new timeline, one that could be markedly different from the one they have known.\n\nSome scholars believed there was some unperceived power greater than the gods that scrutinized these alternate timelines and made it their duty to ensure their wholeness."

        "Usage": "[[File:Chrono5.png|thumb|width|350px|''A chronomancer moves through the Temporal Prime.'']]\nTime-manipulation and time travel were often used by chronomancers, practitioners of [[arcane magic]] that focused on their own specific school of magic called [[chronomancy]]. These individuals tapped into the [[Temporal Prime]], a collection of timestreams, where one timestream represented a single reality. It was possible to travel from one reality to another via these timestreams, usually via temporal vortices.\n\nMost chronomancers native to the Realms were devotees of either the goddess of Mystra, or of the deities of history, Deneir and Oghma. In most instances they were devout guardians of historical knowledge and used their powers solely to gather information.\n\nThe spacefaring [[illithid]] race was said to have traveled back from the \"very end of time\" when their civilization was on the brink of complete annihilation, to various different [[cosmologies]] across the multiverse.",

        "History": "At some point in history the Weavers created the original black obelisks, devices that had the power to change time and reality in profound ways.

While its name may be attributed to its founder in the Realms, in other instances it may be mere coincidence. Over the course of his life he became increasingly concerned about the arcanists' collective arrogance, believing that it would be the undoing of their great magocratic empire.\n\nAt some point during the first three millennia of the [[Age of Humanity]], the arcanists of Netheril recovered the specifications of the black obelisks originally created by the Weavers. They crafted a number of these powerful artifacts as a means to circumvent any catastrophic consequences they may have befell their empire. There was no recorded evidence that any of the obelisks were successfully used in that manner.\n\nThe last known journey to recover one of the ''time gates'' was recorded to have occurred in the {{YearlinkName|404}}.",
