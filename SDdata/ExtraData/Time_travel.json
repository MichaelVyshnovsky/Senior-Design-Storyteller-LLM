They could see their home as it was years past or even visit an ancient civilization of which they were only somewhat familiar.For the purposes of this article, time is referred to how it exists on the Prime Material Plane except where otherwise noted. Time is experienced differently on certain planes of existence. It was an extremely difficult and demanding feat that came with great risk to anyone involved.\nTime travel was distinctly different from seeing into or predicting the future, a power that was granted by magical school of divination.\nTime travel was strictly regulated by deities of the Realms. In the ages before and up to the fall of Netheril, Mystryl, the ancient goddess of time and magic, allowed no being to change the \"stream of time\". This law generally held, save for a single manner of her choosing, the time conduit, and was omniscient to any anomalous events that attempted to bypass her law. \nLimitations on time travel continued under the goddess successors, the two incarnations of Mystra, and her allies Oghma and Deneir, for at least the next 1700 years. It was unknown what role if any Chronos, the Orvan god of time, played in this role.\nIt was impossible for a being to travel in time on another plane of existence, specifically the Demiplane of Time, and then return to the crystal sphere of the planet Toril, or its predecessor Abeir-Toril.\nMany sages believed that if an individual altered a crucial or decisive event, they could alter the \"stream of time\" and begin the formation of a new timeline, one that could be markedly different from the one they have known.\nSome scholars believed there was some unperceived power greater than the gods that scrutinized these alternate timelines and made it their duty to ensure their wholeness.\nthumb|width|350px|A chronomancer moves through the Temporal Prime.\nTime-manipulation and time travel were often used by chronomancers, practitioners of arcane magic that focused on their own specific school of magic called chronomancy. These individuals tapped into the Temporal Prime, a collection of timestreams, where one timestream represented a single reality. It was possible to travel from one reality to another via these timestreams, usually via temporal vortices.\nMost chronomancers native to the Realms were devotees of either the goddess of Mystra, or of the deities of history, Deneir and Oghma. In most instances they were devout guardians of historical knowledge and used their powers solely to gather information.\nThe spacefaring illithid race was said to have traveled back from the \"very end of time\" when their civilization was on the brink of complete annihilation, to various different cosmologies across the multiverse.\nThe primary magical means of time travel was time conduit, an ancient chronomancy spell created by Mystryl that opened a temporary portal to another time.\nThe time conduit spell required specific knowledge of the year or era during which the destination time occurred. As such, there were no signs it could be used to travel forward in time.\nWhile it was believed by some that there were magical means to bypass the restrictions of the time conduit, a spell originating from ancient Netheril belayed that notion. The transmutation spell teleport through time allowed a select group of people to travel back in time thousands of years, albeit with some temporal shift in their exact desired destination. It was possible that a being casting teleport through time could even encounter another version of themself in the same timeline. The explanation for this apparent exception to Mystryls precise temporal rules remained unexplained as of the 14 century DR.\nWhile not time travel per se, practitioners of chronomancy were able to temporarily cease the movement of time for a select number of beings using spells such as temporal stasis or time stop.\nThe Realms were home to at least five time gates, permanent portals that allowed for time travel, As was demonstrated in at least one specific occurrence, the knowledge to create new portals was not entirely lost to time.\nThree time gates were recorded by the ancient of scholars of Mystryl, whose studies back to the time of ancient Netheril\n* A cave set deep within the Spine of the World mounts in the North.\n* Atop the toppled apex of Miskens Peak, frozen beneath the Great Glacier.\n* In a cave within Mount Andrus in the Vilhon Reach current whereabouts unknown due to an erroneous transcription of the locale as \"Andrios Peak\".\nThe fourth time gate known only by ten elves of the city of Chrysalis\n* Within a cave beneath a waterfall that fed Mirror Lake in Synnoria.\nA fifth time gate reconstructed by the Imperial Society of Historial Study for use in their study of ancient history\n* Hidden inside a monastery set deep within the Orsraun Mountains in Turmish.\nThe constantly moving whirlpool associated with the goddess Umberlee\n* The mysterious vortex called Umberlees Fist was actually a traveling undersea portal that transported vessels across great distances, and due to its poor temporal anchoring, occasionally back in time.\nFinally, a malfunctioning portal created by an unnamed and unconventional wizard\n* Found in Triel, the one-way portal operated by Conrath Isthan would sporadically and repeatedly send its \"passengers\" centuries in the past to a singular moment, the summoning forth of a balor somewhere on Toril.\nAt some unknown time and place, a group of powerful spellcasters known as the Weavers crafted the first of the black obelisks, powerful magical artifacts that were capable of transporting an entire city back in time.Page 262 of Icewind Dale Rime of the Frostmaiden refers to \"reset(ing) the world to a previous time\", but for the purposes of this wiki is not taken as a literal statement. The knowledge of their creation eventually passed down to the arcanists of ancient Netheril, who crafted a number of them for use on their great flying cities.\nAfter the fall of Netheril, the remaining black obelisks remained scattered across the Realms. the great dungeon-complex of Undermountain, within the tunnels beneath Gracklstugh in the Underdark, the ruined necropolis of Ythryn beneath the Great Glacier,\nPsionicist practitioners of the psychoportation discipline were capable of reversing or moving forward time in a limited scope for a matter of seconds, using powers such as time regression and time hop. It was unknown how if at all these powers were affected by the rules of limitation placed forward by Mystryl.\nAt some point in history the Weavers created the original black obelisks, devices that had the power to change time and reality in profound ways. They were subsequently removed from all known existence by the being known as Vecna, and the knowledge of their creation remained only with the Oerthian lich-god.\nThe legendary arcanist Jeriah Chronos was born in the in the , a date birth marked the beginning Netherils Golden Age. The vain arcanist would formulate and craft his first time-manipulation spell a mere 68 years later, and begin the school of magic that carried on his name and legacy.According to page 62 of the 2 edition sourcebook Chronomancer magical school of Chronomancy was \"discovered\" by a number of different beings at a myriad of different locations across time and space. While its name may be attributed to its founder in the Realms, in other instances it may be mere coincidence. Over the course of his life he became increasingly concerned about the arcanists collective arrogance, believing that it would be the undoing of their great magocratic empire.\nAt some point during the first three millennia of the Age of Humanity, the arcanists of Netheril recovered the specifications of the black obelisks originally created by the Weavers. They crafted a number of these powerful artifacts as a means to circumvent any catastrophic consequences they may have befell their empire. There was no recorded evidence that any of the obelisks were successfully used in that manner.\nThe last known journey to recover one of the time gates was recorded to have occurred in the .\n* Dragon magazine 430\nCategoryChronology\n211nxe1n44mxmcpmrxnahdca708el9r"
