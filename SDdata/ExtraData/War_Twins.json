According to Azuposi legend, he went on a rampage through the world, but became tired and laid down to rest on the banks of the Pasocada River, where a local man and woman took pity on him and provided food and drink. As a reward for their kindness, he pledged to provide prosperity for the Azuposi people, creating the settlement of Yapoza at the location where he took his rest, and put into place a matrilineal society to keep some degree of control over the Azuposi.\nCategoryAzuposi pantheon\nCategoryHuman deities\nCategoryDeities\nCategorySpirits\ndke9xidwtk489iho4nhxhfwbmuiwrdv"
