        "Society": "The only drow societies that conducted the Running were those that had a physically close access to the surface. The Running consisted of going to a surface community to kill its inhabitants and pillage the community. It was considered an occasion to \"hunt and revel\" by the drow.",
        "Procedure": "As mentioned above, the Running was an annual ritual. The exact date was often varied by the city to give them a degree of unpredictability and prevent the community to be massacred from shoring up its defenses or buying outside help.\n\nIt was expected that young drow who were on their first Running combine it with their [[Blooding]] ritual.\n\nA side-effect of the Running was that rivals among the drow killed each other \"by accident\" in the confusion.",
