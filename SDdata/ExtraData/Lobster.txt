'''Lobsters''' were a type of crustacean that could be found in the Realms.<ref group="note" name="species">These core sources &mdash; ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' on page 50, ''[[Monstrous Compendium Volume Two]]'' on page 29, and the 1{{st}} edition [[Dungeon Masters Guide 1st edition|''Dungeon Masters Guide'']] on pages 180 & 224 &mdash; all state that [[crayfish]] and lobsters are the same thing. While crayfish are similar to lobsters and are even colloquially known as "freshwater lobsters," they are distinct creatures.

==History==
In [[1374 DR]], a false [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]] in [[Wheloon]] kept water barrels full of live [[crab]]s, lobsters, and [[shrimp]] to feed their aquatic [[otyugh]] guardian.

Lobsters were once considered to be one of the great delicacies of the [[Sword Coast North]], but by the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] few people in [[Luskan]] sought to trap them.

==Species==
;[[Giant lobster]]: A monstrously sized species of lobster.{{Cite polyhedron/77/Downunder the Living City|11}}
;Rock lobster: A species of lobster endemic to the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. First discovered underneath a dock, this species was named for their coloration resembling rocks in their habitats, which gave them a natural form of camouflage.<ref>
;[[Star lobster]]:A species of lobster endemic to [[Firedrake Bay]].

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Lobsters were known to be found in the [[Dragon Reach]], the [[Sea of Swords]], the [[Trackless Sea]], and the [[Celestial Sea]].

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], large lobsters could be found in [[Blibdoolpoolp]]'s realm in the [[Elemental Plane of Water]]. In the [[Astral Plane]], lobsters could be found in the [[Living Sea]].

===Relationships===
Lobsters in [[Ser√¥s]] often had antagonistic relationships with [[moray eel]]s and [[octopus|octopi]].

Large lobsters could typically be found inside the temple complexes of Blibdoolpoolp,
===Usages===
Lobsters were fished for as a source of food by a variety of people, such as the inhabitants of [[Ravens Bluff]], [[Velen]], and the [[giant]]s of [[Maelstrom (fortress)|Maelstrom]]. Fishermen from [[Miyama Province]] were known to fish for them around the island of [[Marujima]].

The fishing for lobsters was so common that there were traps specifically designed for capturing them, known as [[lobster trap]]s. ''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold these for around 5 [[gold piece]]s.

Restaurants in the Realms that were known to serve lobsters included [[The Painted Boat]] near Ravens Bluff{{Cite polyhedron/79/The Living City: The Painted Boat Restaurant|15,17}} and the [[Stonecutter's Solace]] in [[Port Llast]].

Aquatic creatures known to prey upon lobsters included [[merfolk]] and [[tako]].

In the land of [[Chult]], legends claimed that a tribe of [[human]] fishermen named the [[Aldani]] overfished a river until no lobsters remained and as punishment [[Ubtao]] transformed them into lobster-like creatures.

==Trivia==
The ''[[apparatus of Kwalish]]'' resembled a lobster.
