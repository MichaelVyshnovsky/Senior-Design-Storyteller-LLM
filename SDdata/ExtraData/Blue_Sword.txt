The Blue Sword was a title within the government of Archendale, one of the three anonymous Swords of Archendale. The Blue Sword was the battle-mage of the Archenriders. 
In the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, the Blue Sword was Alduvar Snowbrand, a veteran mage of the army. In his public life, Alduvar was the proprietor of Jandalars Fine Fruits, a trading coster representing Archendales vast produce and orchard exports. Like all the Swords, he protected his identity with a number of illusion spells and a pair of bracers of misdirection.
