He was expected to rule wisely in the best interests of the people of Rashemen. His duties included keeping travel between settlements relatively safe, securing the frontier lands, controlling raiding monsters from the wilder parts of Rashemen, and serving as supreme warlord during times of war. \n\nAt a local level, each settlement was ruled over by a ''[[fyrra]]'' who only controlled the armed forces under his command. A ''fyrra'''s rule could be compared to that of a mayor. Each ''fyrra'' reported to the Iron Lord. \n\nThe real power, however, lay with the [[Wychlaran]]. They picked the Iron Lord and could change him whenever they felt it necessary.",
