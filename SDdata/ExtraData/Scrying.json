        "Magical sensor": "Many [[divination]] spells of the scrying subschool created a magical sensor that sent the caster information. The sensor had the sensory acuity of the caster and acted as though it were a separate, independent organ. Any intelligent creature could notice an active magical sensor. The sensor could be dispelled.",
        "Limits": "Scrying could not penetrate [[lead]], with lead sheeting or high concentrations in natural rock being effective barriers. Some buildings such as the [[House of the Moon]] had a lead lining in their outer walls for this purpose.<ref>\n\nSeveral magic spells, ''[[antimagic field]]'', ''[[mind blank]]'', ''[[nondetection]]'', The [[semi-precious stones|semi-precious stone]] [[tchazar]] could blur the scrying of anything close to it.",
        "Aids": "A [[chrysoberyl]] gem (''aka'' \"cat's eye\") could be used for short-range but very detailed scrying.",
