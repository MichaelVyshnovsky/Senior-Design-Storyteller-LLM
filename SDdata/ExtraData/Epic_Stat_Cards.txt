'''Epic Stat Cards''' were special promotional trading cards released through retailers for use in [[D&D Miniatures]] tournaments sponsored by [[DCI]] (formerly Duelists' Convocation International). The cards had statistics for one NPC or creature miniature that boosted the capabilities of that piece in the tournament. On the reverse of the card was an artist's drawing of the subject of the card.{{Cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mit/20060406b| title=Epic Stat Cards| accessdate=2020-03-03| format=HTML| work=D&D Miniatures Tournaments| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623231403/http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mit/20060406b| archivedate=2011-06-23}}

One card was released each month from January 2006 until July 2008 and were eligible for tournament play from the time of release. Some popular cards were released more than once. The only way to acquire a physical card was to attend an event at a participating retailer. Each card image became available as a PDF download from the Wizards of the Coast web site in the month following its release.
