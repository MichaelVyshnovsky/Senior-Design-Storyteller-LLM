'''Druid circles''' were organizations of [[druid]]s sharing certain common beliefs and abilities, fulfilling the same function as temple hierarchies did for [[priest]]s.<ref group="note">The term ''druid circle'' is also, much more rarely, used to designate ritual places such as circles of [[menhir]] or the [[Redwood Ring]]. ([[Serpent Kingdoms]], page 108)

==Organization==
While druid circles were obviously populated by druids, they also often included other nature-friendly allies such as [[wood elves]], [[ranger]]s, and [[fey]] creatures such as [[dryad]]s. Generally all members of a circle were deemed equal, including non-druids, with an unofficial hierarchy based on age and individual accomplishments. Though in some groups, druids were revered by the non-druids who worked in their circle.

A typical circle included up to a dozen druids plus their allies, although some larger ones existed. Members could be worshipers of various nature [[deities]] or all could be devoted to the same power, such as [[Chauntea]], [[Eldath]], [[Mielikki]], [[Silvanus]], or even the [[Elemental Lords]], with [[Grumbar]] and [[Kossuth]] being the most commonly revered of the Lords.

==Activities==
Druid circles gathered to honor nature and its cycles, to protect sacred places, or to ensure the balance of nature wasn't threatened by civilization. This included fighting diseases affecting living beings, ensuring beasts could feed and breed in peace, slowing woodcutting and burning of trees, as well as making sure roads were built sparingly.

It was usual for the population of settlements established near wild places to seek the local circle's blessing before hunting or farming in their territory.

Gathering of circles often took places in clearings, or in sacred places such as the [[Dancing Place]], [[moonwell]]s or [[menhir]] circles. In urban environments such as [[Waterdeep]], circles would meet in [[:category:parks|parks]], or sometimes in cellars which contained a natural pool, running water, or earthen floor.

==Society==
===Children of the circle===
As circles were not only composed of druids but also their allies, some included whole families. Children raised in a circle developed a strong understanding of the wilderness, and if raised in the vicinity of a large town often became liaison between their organization and more civilized folks.

===Volodni society===
The [[Volodni|pine folk]] of [[Northeast Faerûn]] were really close to nature, and organized in tribes led by druid circles.

==Relationships==
===The Harpers===
[[Harpers]] were notable allies of many circles active in [[North Faerûn]], especially the [[High Dance]]. Their rangers and [[bard]]s served as connection between the organizations, were offered [[:Category:Food and drink|food]] and shelter, and were allowed to attend and speak during gatherings. This wasn't true for all circles, though, some considering those who harp as dangerous for the natural balance as the evils they fought.

== Notable Circles==

===Circle of Dreams===
[[File:Circle_of_Dreams.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''An [[elven]] druid of the Circle of Dreams.'']]
{{Quote|The realms protected by druids of the Circle of Dreams are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and the weary can find rest.|Anonymous.{{Cite MTG|AFR|176|Circle of Dreams Druid|[[Sam Guay]]}}}}
{{Main|Circle of Dreams}}
Druids of the Circle of Dreams maintained a strong bond with the [[Feywild]] and counted themselves among the allies of the benevolent [[fey]] creatures of the Realms. They protected the bountiful, often dreamlike locales in the wild, instilling in those they encountered a sense of wonder and dreamlike fantasy that could uplift even  the most downtrodden.

Drawing from their benefactors of the [[Summer Court]], these druids could offer additional healing to others by means of their naturalistic balms. More experienced Circle of Dreams druids could even draw upon powers of the [[Gloaming Court]] to form shadowy refuges, within which they could rest without worry of harm or intrusion. The most skilled of this order could readily travel through [[fey crossroad]]s and venture into the dreamscapes of others, by means of ''[[dream|illusion]]'' or ''[[Scrying (spell)|divination]]''. Several times a day they could even ''[[teleportation circle|teleport]]'' to any location upon which they last slept.

===Circle of the Land===
[[File:Circle of the Land Druid.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''A [[gnome|gnomish]] druid of the Circle of the Land.'']]
{{Main|Circle of the Land}}
Those belonging to the Circle of the Land were among the most knowledgeable and sociable of druids, meeting frequently in sacred spaces to discuss and pass on mystic lore through the oral tradition. These druids often served as kind of liaison between the rest of druidic society and the civilized world, serving as advisers and priests to local communities that remained true to the Old Faith. Members of the Circle of the Land were generally more magically adept than other druids, gaining access to a number of extra spells as well as the ability to restore their expended magic through meditation. Their affinity for magic also gave them immunity to certain forms of elemental or fey magic, as well as to virtually all forms of disease or poison.

Druids from the Circle of the Land were often deeply entwined with the land and the people they served, and their primal magic frequently took on a form which reflected the local landscape. For example, a Druid of the Land living in an arctic climate could cast ''[[sleet storm]] ''or ''[[cone of cold]]'' while one living in the [[Underdark]] could instead cast ''[[gaseous form]]'' or ''[[insect plague]]''. Likewise, druids with a moderate degree of training in the Circle were able to move through nonmagical difficult terrain such as thorns or spines with relative ease and even possessed some resistance to magical forms, such as the vines created by an ''[[entangle]]'' spell. The close connection between Druids of the Land and the wilderness they served also helped them in encounters with wild beasts or plants, who instinctively hesitated when attacking experienced members of the Circle.

===Circle of the Moon===
[[File:Circle of the Moon Druid AFR.jpg|thumb|270px|''A [[half-elf]] druid of the Circle of the Moon.'']]
{{Main|Circle of the Moon}}
Favored by those who preferred a more solitary path, the Circle of the Moon was an ancient association of druids devoted to the mastery of the Wild Shape. Gathering only occasionally under the cloak of darkness to discuss news or pass on warnings, Druids of the Moon often went weeks without seeing another druid or even simply another humanoid. Enjoying the flexibility their Wild Shape ability offered them, druids from the Circle of the Moon were prone to employing a wide variety of shapes, as the situation required, or the druid's own whims decided; the same druid might go one day as a great cat and the following as an eagle.{{cite book/Player's Handbook 5th edition|69}}

The effort Druids of the Moon put into mastering their Wild Shape ability had many benefits. Even neophyte members of the Circle could shapeshift more quickly than other druids, and with additional training they could employ far more powerful beast forms than those available to other Circles. With experience, more advanced aspects of Wild Shape became available, such as the ability to overcome magical resistance or to transform into an [[elemental]]. The most experienced Druids of the Moon could control their shapeshifting ability to such a subtle degree so as to emulate the effects of the ''[[alter self]]'' spell at will.

===Circle of the Shepherd===
{{Main|Circle of the Shepherd}}
Circle of the Shepherd druids called upon the [[nature spirit|spirits]] of the natural world, along with those of animals and even creatures from the Feywild. Like most other druids they felt most at home in the wilderness, far away from the trappings of civilization. They protected wildlife and fey beasts by turning away monstrous predators and hunters alike, and often took to adventuring in order to pacify the most dangerous threats of the Realms.

As befitting their charge, these druids learned to commune with animals and fey early in their calling. They developed the power to summon forth [[spirit totem]]s, spirits of once-living animals. These spirit totems grew in power over time, themselves learning to protect innocent animals and guard their bonded druid from any mortal threat they faced.

===Circle of Stars===
{{Main|Circle of Stars}}
The Circle of Stars was a former druidic circle from the [[Dalelands]] whose members drew upon the power of the stars and other [[:Category:celestial bodies|celestial bodies]]. They believed they could wield the powers of the [[cosmology|cosmos]] by tracking the movement of these bodies across the night sky and recording them in magnificent megaliths, such as the [[Standing Stone]].

Novice druids of this circle learned to create miniature star maps, which they then used as their [[spell focus]]. As they strengthened their bond to the stars, they utilized it to seek omens from the skies above. Circle of Stars druids also learned how ''[[wild shape]]'' into new luminescent forms, which resembled constellations come to life. The starry forms of the most powerful druids allowed their bodies to become temporarily incorporeal, protecting them from the perils of [[Prime Material plane|the Prime]].
