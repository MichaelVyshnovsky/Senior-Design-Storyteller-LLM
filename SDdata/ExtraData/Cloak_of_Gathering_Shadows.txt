The '''Cloak of Gathering Shadows''' was a ritual used by [[sha'ir]]s to grant their [[gen]] the ability to hide within shadows with ease.

==Preparation==
This ritual required a [[spider]] web found beneath the shadow of a rock. The web needed to at least be large enough to cover the upper body of the gen. Additionally, the ritual needed the hair of a stealthy individual, typically a [[holy slayer]] or skilled thief.

The spider web was fixed to the gen's back during the 18 hour ritual, granting the gen the ability to hide in the shadows like a skilled thief. The chance of hiding was increased if a more skilled sha'ir completed the ritual.
