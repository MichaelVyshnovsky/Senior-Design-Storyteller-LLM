        "Description": "The ''takht'' consisted of an esemble of a ''[[qanun of the spirits]]'', a ''[[riqq of the efreet]]'', a ''[[rababah of the dao]]'', an ''[['Ud of the marids|'ud of the marids]]'', and a ''[[nay of the djinn]]''.",
        "Powers": "Though each instrument of the jann was a powerful [[enchanted|magic item]], the true power of these instruments was unleashed when combined and played together. A group of [[bard]]s or ''[[rawunin]]'' playing these instruments under the direction of a skilled [[sha'ir]] was capable of summoning an army of [[genie]]s. This army encompassed four genie units—one for each of the major genie races—each measuring 100 strong. Each of these units was under the command of a powerful [[noble genie]]. In order to summon the genie army, the musicians needed to play their instruments uninterrupted for a full hour. If the music were interrupted in any way, then the genies who had already arrived would not be under control.\n\nA successful summons granted the sha'ir complete command of the genie army for 25 hours. The genies returned to their native planes when this time expired. All genies serving within this army would not be able to harm the sha'ir for the next 101 years.\n\nGiven the power the ''takht'' had over genie-kind, most genies and genie servitors were on the constant lookout for anyone attempting to assemble a complete collection of the magical instruments required. These collectors were known to disappear or meet otherwise unfortunate ends.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Historically, only the Amir of the [[High Desert]] was granted possession of a complete set of instruments needed for a ''takht of the jann,'' but the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Caliph]] in [[Huzuz]] was rumored to own a set as well.",
