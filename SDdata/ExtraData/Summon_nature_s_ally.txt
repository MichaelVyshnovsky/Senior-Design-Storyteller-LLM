'''''Summon Nature's Ally I&ndash;IX''''' was a series of increasingly powerful [[druid]] spells, some of which were also available to [[rangers]] and those [[divine magic|divine]] spellcasters which were granted the [[animal domain]]. Some druids could cast these spells without preparation by sacrificing a different spell to channel its energy into the summoning.

Each spell summoned one or more natural creatures, including [[animal]]s, [[elemental]]s, [[fey]], and [[magical beasts]]. The caster was not able to summon a creature into an environment that could not support it (for example, water-breathing creatures could not be summoned outside of water). When used to summon elemental, [[chaotic]], [[lawful]], [[evil]], or [[good]] creatures, the spell itself adopted the same type as the creature.

The spells included:
* [[Summon nature's ally I]]
* [[Summon nature's ally II]]
* [[Summon nature's ally III]]
* [[Summon nature's ally IV]]
* [[Summon nature's ally V]]
* [[Summon nature's ally VI]]
* [[Summon nature's ally VII]]
* [[Summon nature's ally VIII]]
* [[Summon nature's ally IX]]
