'''Cejor''' was probably a [[metallic dragon]] who was caught by the silver dragon [[Azhaq]] in the act of brewing some useless potion as part of her experiments in mitigating the [[Rage of Dragons]]. She gave up [[Karasendrieth]]'s name once questioned on her experiments, which led to [[Lareth]] ordering she be caught, per [[Llimark]]'s reckoning, on [[Hammer 6]] in {{yearlink|1373}}.{{cite book/The Rage||10}}
