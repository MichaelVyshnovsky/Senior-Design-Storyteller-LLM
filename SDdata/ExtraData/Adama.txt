The '''Adama''' was a spiritual belief held by almost all [[Durpari]].<ref name=S116>

After [[Mulhorand]] invaded Durpar and wiped out the barbarian clans, a simple trader emerged to lead the remnants of his people. His name was [[Satama]] and he claimed to have experienced a divine revelation, which he turned into the philosophy of the Adama.<ref name=T54>

The core principle of the Adama was that everything ''is'' the Adama. The gods, the world and everything in it were just aspects of the Adama.<ref name=T59>

To become one with the Adama, a person must have been born many times. As each reincarnation of that person was believed to reflect their previous life, believers in the Adama strove to improve themselves and their lives.<ref name=T59/> Crime was as dangerous to oneself as it was to the victim as it grievously jeopardized a person's chance of being reincarnated as anything better than an animal.<ref name=T59/> Therefore, not only did followers of the Adama make very hard workers at whatever they chose to do,<ref name=S8> but crime levels were low over the [[Shining Lands]].<ref name=S115>

Killing was frowned upon, even in self-defense. Therefore, most Durparians who used [[arcane]] [[magic]] specialized in [[illusion]]s since, for one to die from magic from that school, one must have believed in the illusion. This was seen as fate killing the aggressor and thus a lesser offense against the Adama.<ref name=T59/>

Believers viewed the Adama as a unifying world-spirit and worshiped its aspects, the gods, rather than the spirit itself. Therefore, no temples to the Adama were built.<ref name=T59/> This led to massive religious diversity in the Shining Lands.<ref name=T59/> Only gods who demanded human sacrifice had their faiths suppressed along with [[Mask]], the god of thieves, for obvious reasons.<ref name=T59/> Gods most associated with the Adama were [[Zionil]] ([[Gond]]), [[Curna]] ([[Oghma]]), [[Lucha]] ([[Sel√ªne]]), [[Torm]], and [[Waukeen]].<ref name=S116/>

Just like the gods were aspects of the Adama, so too were the various species of the world. No follower of the Adama would turn away anyone based on their race alone.<ref name=T57>
