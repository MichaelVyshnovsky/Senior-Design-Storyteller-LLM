'''Zor''' (feminine form '''Zora''') was a general noble title of unknown rank in [[Mulmaster]].

==Description==
Zor was the male form for this title, and the female form was Zora. They were equivalent to "Syl", as used in [[Calimshan]], and "Saer", as used elsewhere in [[Faer√ªn]]. The heads of the noble families of Mulmaster were always known as lords, even if they were female. If these lords were dejected or killed, the zors and zoras would lose their rank and become commoners.
