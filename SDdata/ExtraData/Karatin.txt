'''Karatin''' was a seaport city at the mouth of the [[Hungtse River]]. It was built on a swamp, but partly settled on a cleared-out jungle. 

==History==
It was founded during the [[Hai Dynasty]] in 830. It was one of the first cities to have a unified architectural theme. It had northern facing buildings and wide paved stone streets with the [[Great Palace of the Sea Lords]] in the center of the city.

==Notable locations==
Karatin also had the [[Temple of the Jade Empress]], a beautiful temple erected by the Sea Lords around a statue of the Empress [[Ti Hai Chin]], wife of the Hai DynastyÂ’'s founder.

The harbor was deep and well dredged. Ships constantly came here for [[silk]], rice and to learn advanced sciences. It was a busy port, where people could acquire almost any type of goods, and meet folk from all over [[Kara-Tur]]. This was also the port to which most foreigners came when they visited [[Kara-Tur]].
