[pronounced /sɛˈluːneɪ/ \"seh-LOON-ay\"]\n\nSelûne was the goddess of the moon, the mysterious power that governed the tides and reproductive cycles, caused were-creatures to shift, and brought a being to the brink of madness and back again. She shone a light in the darkness, guiding those who were lost.\n* [[:File:Selune symbol.jpg]]\n\nShe oversaw the moon, stars, and navigation; looked out for navigators, wanderers, and seekers; and was the patron of were-creatures of good heart.\n\nShe was believed to be the moon itself, with the same name. The lights that trailed behind it were her Tears, shed in joy and sorrow.\n* [[:File:Selûne and her Tears.jpg]]\n\nLike the moon's phases, her aspect changed with time. She might be an ethereal young girl, a beautiful dusky-skinned lady, or a plump matronly old woman, always blooming to youthfulness or ageing and fading away, like the waxing and waning of the moon.\n* [[:File:Selune.jpg]]\n\nThe Moonmaiden could be vivacious and majestic, full of joy and dance. Or she could be subdued and tranquil, motherly and embracing. Or she was distant, worn down by old defeats and sadness. Though peaceful, when pressed she could be coldly aggressive and fiercely protective.\n* [[:File:Luna scrying.jpg]]\n\nBut Selûne was always caring and accepting, forgiving of faults, and generous with blessings while asking little of her faithful. Sometimes she lived among mortals, and once ran an inn in Waterdeep, aiding adventurers there.\n\nShe appealed to all kinds of folk: sailors and seamstresses, alewives and astrologers, laundresses and lycanthropes, mystics and mages, expectant mothers and eccentric outsiders, fortune-tellers and freaks—all found friends under the light of the moon. Her clergy provided healing of body and mind, told fortunes, and fought evil were-creatures.\n* [[:File:Silverstar.jpg]]\n\nSelûne fought an eternal war with her sister Shar, goddess of the night, seen in the night sky every month. Shar's darkness devoured the moonlight until the new moon when Shar killed Selûne, before she was replenished and restored to radiance.\n* [[:File:Selûne vs Shar.jpg]]\n* [[:File:Selune v Shar DC Comics.jpg]]\n* [[:File:Shar vs Selune.jpeg]]\n\nTo learn more about Selûne and her church, visit the Forgotten Realms Wiki on FANDOM.\n\n[[Category:Video transcripts]]\nezj17kgrcb08o2iyebz0bdej5v87que"
