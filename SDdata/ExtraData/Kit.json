Each kit provided a specific role and a set of requirements, limitations and benefits to give a character its own twist. Usually, these kits where specific to a character class.\nThe variation from the standard class a kit provided ranged from slight to very profound.\nThe Al-Qadim campaign required a kit for every character."
