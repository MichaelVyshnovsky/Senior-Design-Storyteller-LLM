        "mainbody": "'''school of incantation''' contained spells that targeted magic itself and the way of casting it. Like other [[schools of effect]], it thus grouped spells not like the traditional nine [[schools of magic]] based on their philosophy, but on what they affected.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Cult of the Dragon (sourcebook)|Cult of the Dragon]]'' does not call incantation a \"school of effect\", a term from ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'', but it fits the definition there.\n\nSpecialists in this school, called [[incantatrix]]es (or incantatars), were exceedingly rare. None were known outside of western [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Subschools": "Incantation spells could be divided into four groups:\n*'''Banishment''': These spells were meant to send back magically summoned creatures.\n*'''Disruptive''': Spells of this kind targeted magic already in place or the ability of another magic-user to cast spells.\n*'''[[Metamagic]]''': These were spells that influenced the effectiveness of other spells, e.g. by changing their reach, area or intensity.<ref> \n*'''Shielding''': These were spells intended to protect a caster from another's magic."
