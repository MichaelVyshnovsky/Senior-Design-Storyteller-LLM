Druids who took up the cause of nature in such a region had an affinity for this circle and the suite of spells that came to them without cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).\nSwamp circle druids were granted the ability to cast darkness and Melfs acid arrow. Advanced druids of such a circle could cast water walk, stinking cloud, freedom of movement, and locate creature. Greater druids of the swamp circle could cast both insect plague and scrying.\nCategoryDruid circles\ndhee3xdx386s1uqnlqjz3adjgtdmgwo"
