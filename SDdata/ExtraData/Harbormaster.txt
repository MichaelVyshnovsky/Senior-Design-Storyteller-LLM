The Harbormaster of Baldurs Gate was a crucial seat of power within the citys bureaucracy. As the Gate was an invaluable trading port in the economy of the Sword Coast, the office held great importance. The Harbormasters responsibilities included overseeing Gray Harbor, maintaining its manifest and setting taxes for goods imported into the city. 
They were headquartered in the eponymous Harbormasters Office in the Eastway district of the Lower City.
The Harbormaster of the city during the midâ€“14 century DR saved the life of Duke Eltan after he was poisoned by his personal healer, Rashad.
Erl Namorann served as the Harbormaster during 1482 DR. About a decade later, Darus Kelinoth had taken the role of Harbormaster.
