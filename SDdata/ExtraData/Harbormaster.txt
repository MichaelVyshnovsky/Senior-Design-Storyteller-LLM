The '''Harbormaster''' of [[Baldur's Gate]] was a crucial seat of power within the city's bureaucracy. As the Gate was an invaluable trading port in the economy of the [[Sword Coast]], the office held great importance. The Harbormaster's responsibilities included overseeing [[Gray Harbor]], maintaining its manifest and setting taxes for goods imported into the city. 

They were headquartered in the eponymous [[Harbormaster's Office]] in the [[Eastway (Baldur's Gate)|Eastway]] district of the [[Lower City]].
