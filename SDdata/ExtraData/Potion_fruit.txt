'''''Potion fruit''''' was a general term for [[enchanted]] fruits and berries on the desert world of [[Athas]], which took the place of [[potion]]s and magical [[oil]]s as water was too rare and valuable a resource there to waste on such usages.

==Effects==
The magical effects of a ''potion fruit'' were contained within its juices, which had to be ingested or allowed to run over the user's body in the case of oil-type ''potion fruit''. This had to be done within one minute of breaking the fruit's skin, beyond which these magical properties were lost, and they lasted for a period equivalent to a potion or oil on other worlds.

''Potion fruit'' had a greater shelf-life than their base fruit, remaining ripe for strictly 99 years before rotting normally. Enchantment did not cause any change in taste from the base fruit, though ''potion fruits'' and the trees they grew upon could be identified with ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[identify]]'', and similar [[spell]]s.

==Varieties==
There existed ''potion fruit'' equivalents for all manner of potions that were common across the [[Multiverse]], such as [[apple]]s that acted as ''[[potion of healing|potions of healing]]'', [[cherry|cherries]] that acted as ''[[potion of bull's strength|potions of bull's strength]]'', [[pear]]s that acted as ''[[potion of restoration|potions of restoration]]'', or [[persimmon]]s that acted as ''[[potion of levitation|potions of levitation]]''.

==Creation==
A ''potion fruit'' could be created by a [[cleric]], [[druid]], or [[wizard]] by enchanting mundane fruit in much the same way they would create potions and magical oils. [[Alchemist]]s could achieve similar results through strange forms of [[herbalism]].<ref> Alternatively, they could be grown by clerics, druids, wizards, or [[ranger]]s by planting a whole ''potion fruit'' in the ground and then tending to the tree it grew within a period of one to six weeks. Once ''potion fruit'' was picked from a tree it would produce no more, though such trees could be made to produce more by casting ''[[permanency]]'' on them. However, a potion fruit tree subjected to ''permanency'' had a maximum lifespan of 99 years.

The type of fruit enchanted had no effect on magical properties. Though fruits that were drier and thus lacking in ample juices, such as [[date]]s, couldn't be made into ''potion fruit''.

==History==
In The Year of Despair, Malatran calendar, late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent from the [[Malatran Plateau]] through an elemental ''[[portal|gate]]'' to the far-away world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by [[Athasian elf]] slavers,{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|9}} Subsequently, the heroes escaped when the elven caravan was attacked by a hungry [[sink worm]]. They seized the opportunity and freed Ka'cha, fleeing from their pursuers across the desert.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|13}}

After two days of travel across the hot sands, guided by Ka'cha, the group stumbled across his tribe, the [[Windrunners]], and their leader, [[Ki'rik'ku]]. Ka'cha convinced them that the strange adventurers were friends, not food. Happy with one of their number returned, chief Ki'rik'ku gifted the aliens four large [[erdlu]] [[egg]]s (an invaluable source of nourishment in the Athasian desert) and two ''apples of healing''. The thri-kreen then explained to the Malatran heroes how to reach their destination—the [[Ringing Forest]]—the way back to [[Toril]].{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|14}}

While on the way to this forest the adventurers came across a [[mul]] village built around an oasis. There they were offered a number of trade goods, including ''potion fruit'' such as ''cherries of bull's strength'', ''pears of restoration'', and a ''persimmon of levitation''.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|18}}
