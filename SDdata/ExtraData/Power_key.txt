'''''Power keys''''' were incredibly rare to allow [[divine spellcaster]]s to circumvent the planar restrictions on [[divine magic]] that existed in the [[Great Wheel cosmology]].

==Description==
The forms that ''power keys'' could take were nearly limitless, from physical objects to even gestures or rituals. However, the form was usually representative of the deity that created it.

==Powers==
A ''power key'' was imbued with part of the divine strength of the deity that made it, This was speculated by sages to create a link to the very source of a deity, allowing one to draw directly on their energy of existence.

Under normal circumstances, ''power keys'' didn't just restore normal functionality to clerical spells, but made them work even better than before and reach their maximum potential. However, many worked only for limited durations, especially those made by [[chaos|chaotic]] deities, having been intentionally designed that way as a safe guard against loss or theft.

They could be divided into three types: specific, general, and greater.
;Specific: The weakest kind of ''power key'', these were tied to only a single spell and were the most likely to have no limited duration.
;General: These ''power keys'' improved all spells of a single [[sphere|sphere of influence]].
;Greater: The most powerful and rarest of ''power keys''. These allowed for far less loss of clerical power due to planar distance from a given deity's home plane. The strongest of these were usually reserved for [[proxy|proxies]] on urgent missions.

Additionally some evil deities, usually [[chaotic evil]] ones, delighted in making false ''power keys''. These altered spells in undesirable ways, perverted them, or outright canceled them. Sometimes even without the caster's knowledge.

==Varieties==
* Among the powers of [[Arcadia]], ''power keys'' were usually highly regulated. [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] gave out ''power keys'' that were [[gold]]en [[battleaxe]]s, [[mithral]] hammers, and miniature replicas of [[anvil]]s. The [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi powers]] [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], and [[Ra]] gave out ''power keys'' made of [[silver]] or petrified wood and in the shape of an [[ankh]] or [[scarab]].<ref>
* The ''power keys'' of the [[Gnome pantheon]]'s members varied in what spheres they granted access to, but virtually all granted access to the [[Elemental sphere|Elemental]] and [[Protection sphere|Protection]] spheres.
* Ilmater was generous with ''power keys''. He usually granted access to the [[All sphere|All]], [[Healing sphere|Healing]], and Protection spheres.
* [[Laduguer]], being a god of crafts, gave out ''power keys'' that were items that had been forged by the recipient and blessed by a [[duergar]] priest. These keys only functioned for their crafters.<ref>
* [[Malar]], being a god of the hunt, gave out ''power keys'' that were animal claws or fangs.<ref>
* Among the powers of the [[Norse pantheon]] ''power keys'' were most often gifted out by [[Frigga]], [[Heimdall]], [[Loki]], [[Odin]], and [[Thor]]. These five typically gave keys out only to priests that they deemed worthy, though as a god of [[thieves]] Loki notably allowed any ''power keys'' that were stolen from him to function. The various other powers of [[Ysgard]] gave out their ''power keys'' on a whim, with the most freely awarded granting access to the [[Combat sphere|Combat]] and [[Guardian sphere|Guardian]] spheres. The ''power keys'' of Odin governed mental spells, such as the various ''[[extension]]'' spells and ''[[Rary's mnemonic enhancer]]''. Loki's ''power keys'' were all related to [[illusion]]s and deceptive [[alteration]]s, such as ''[[alter self]]'', ''[[delude]]'', ''[[mirage arcane]]'', and ''[[vacancy]]''.

==Availability==
''Power keys'' were passed out by deities to those who were their most favored, faithful servants, having earned them through years of service. And usually this gifting was done through a [[proxy]]. However, there were cases in which deities would gift them to receive a servant's aid in direct and dire services, such as the quest to liberate [[Waukeen]] from imprisonment in the Abyss. 

They usually could not be bought or traded for, And on the wartorn plane of [[Acheron]], some military officers were willing to sell theirs for a proper bribe, usually a minimum of 1000 [[gp]], though unscrupulous officers were likely to sell keys close to expiring.

==Notable Users==
* [[Annia Graystockings]], a [[paladin]] of Ilmater, carried a ''power key'' in the form of a wooden carving of two bound hands.
* [[Khamallan Teren]], a proxy of Malar.
