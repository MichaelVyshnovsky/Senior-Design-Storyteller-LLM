        "mainbody": "'''Cities of the Seabreeze''' was a name given to a series of cities lying along the southern shore of the [[Shining Sea]] on the [[Chultan Peninsula]] by the 14th century [[DR]]. The name was sometimes mistakenly applied to only the cities of the [[Lapal League]], but it actually included a few other realms and independent city-states. The area was also known as '''Tashtan'''.{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|35}}\n\nThe Cities of the Seabreeze, from west to east, were:\n* [[Narubel]], part of the realm of [[Thindol]];\n* [[Tashluta]], the capital of the [[Tashalar]]; \n* [[Procalith]], a city-state destroyed in 1142 DR;\n* [[Sammaresh]], [[Untisczer]] (destroyed in 285 DR), [[Uzurr]], [[Ithmong (Lapaliiya)|Ithmong]], [[Lushpool]], [[Sheirlantar]], and [[Sheirtalar]], the cities of [[Lapaliiya]]; and\n* [[Ormpur]], an independent city-state.",
        "History": "The Cities of the Seabreeze had a shared history and culture, having been settled and conquered together by various forces, from the [[yuan-ti]] to the [[Shoon Imperium]].\n\nThe land was once a subject of the yuan-ti empire of [[Serpentes]], but the empire fell into decline and infighting when its emperor [[Sseth]] vanished in the [[10 DR|Year of Dreams, 10 DR]]. After a successful revolt, the humans of the Tashalar marched east, liberating the Cities of the Seabreeze one by one and driving out the yuan-ti. In the [[34 DR|Year of Purloined Power, 34 DR]], the new [[Confederation of Tashtan]] claimed all the southern Shining Sea coastlands, and all the various [[human]]s living there came to be called [[Tashalan]]s (an admixture of Lapaliiyans, Calishites, [[Chultan]]s, and Tashtan-dwelling [[Shaaran]]s). This began a time of prosperity for the Tashtan cities.\n\nThe slayings of a dozen Tashalaran merchant lords by the rogue [[Magister]] [[Ergith Klavulgrun|Ergith \"the Kingslayer\" Klavulgrun]] ([[276 DR|276]]–[[278 DR]]) left Tashtan in a leadership crisis and ill-equipped to resist the demands of [[Qysara]] [[Shoon V]] ([[281 DR|281]]–[[300 DR]]) of the [[Shoon Imperium]] that the Cities of the Seabreeze host garrisons of imperial soldiers. In the [[285 DR|Year of Wasteful Pride, 285 DR]], the Shoon Imperium snatched control of Lapaliiya, but its cities remained effectively independent. The Lapaliiyan city of Untisczer rebelled and, though it was quashed, Shoon V had cause to launch the [[Tashalar Campaigns]]. Untisczer was obliterated as a show of force and the remaining Tashtan cities were captured and installed with military governors, all possessions of the Shoon Imperium.\n\nIn the [[326 DR|Year of Secret Slaughters, 326 DR]], the [[Magister]] [[Onsilur Maerdrathom]] forced the satraps who governed the cities of the Tashtan Coast in the name of the [[Shoon Imperium]] to give all arcane magic-users legal protection and standing, and also quelled conflicts between battling mages. However, [[Qysar]] [[Shoon VII]] had his satraps hire other mages to kill the Magister, so that the Cities of the Seabreeze would remain disunited and feuding, and no threat to the empire.\n\nThe Shoon Imperium finally fell in the [[450 DR|Year of the Corrie Fist, 450 DR]]. The imperial garrisons were driven out of Lapaliiya and the viceroy killed in the Tashalar by the close of the [[451 DR|Year of Unleashed Fears, 451 DR]]. The Tashtan cities broke up into separate nations and independent city-states.\n\nIn the [[1142 DR|Year of the Sword's Oath, 1142 DR]], the [[Coiled Cabal]], a group of [[yuan-ti pureblood]] mages, attempted to reconquer the Cities of the Seabreeze. They were opposed by over two dozen [[archmage]]s of Lapaliiya and Tashluta, who fought first the yuan-ti, then each other as they vied for their own power. For a full season, in a conflict called the [[Rage of Wizards]], they waged wild [[spell]] battles up and down the Tashtan Coast. By its end, the cities of Lapaliiya and the Tashalar had suffered gratuitous destruction, but not one wizard or yuan-ti had won a single crown."
