The Faithless were mortal souls who had died without having chosen a patron deity or who did not have one to take them to their place in the afterlife.
A soul was considered Faithless if, in life, the mortal had resolutely refused any faith or belief or had given no more than empty words of worship to the gods for much of their time and never truly believed.
Rather than wander the Fugue Plane until called by their patron deity or their servant, the souls of the Faithless and the False were compelled to go into the City of Judgment, where they were judged by Kelemvor. The Faithless received only one sentence the Wall of the Faithless. The souls were said to writhe there for eternity. Over time, the mold caused the soul and its consciousness to dissolve into the very substance of the wall.
All folk in Faer√ªn knew and feared that the Faithless would go into the Wall, or else be taken by devils into the Nine Hells or by demons into the Abyss.
Occasionally, a leading demon would open a portal from the Abyss to the Fugue Plane and launch a raid on the City of Judgment. At these times, dozens of lesser demons clawed holes in the Wall of the Faithless, stealing Faithless souls, while others raided the city and seized the False, before retreating with them back to the Abyss.
