A time gate was a permanent physical portal through time.
There were only a handful on Faer√ªn and their locations were unknown to all except certain elven high mages. The gates exact ages were unknown, but they predated even the coming of the dwarves. The gates had the power to transport an individual to any point in the past, according to the wishes of the individual walking through. If no particular period in time was thought of, then the individual was transported to a random point in the past.
