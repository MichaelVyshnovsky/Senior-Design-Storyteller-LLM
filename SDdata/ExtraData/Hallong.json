        "mainbody": "The Hallong was a rite of passage for young male yikarians of the World Pillar Mountains.\nHallong translated literally as \"begging bowl\" in the yikarian language.\nOnce a male yikarian reached adulthood, typically between the ages of 12–14, they were required to undertake the Hallong—a special reconnaissance journey into the lands of the enemies of the Yikarian Empire. A yikarian undertaking their Hallong was not permitted to return home until theyd stolen a powerful magical item, or replaced a member of an enemy society by using their unique magic jar ability. When replacing a member of an enemy society, the yikarian was tasked with learning useful secrets of that society and reporting them back to the Empire. Male yikarians made use of their innate shapechange ability to aid them on their Hallong."
