Ultravision was a type of vision possessed by many creatures in the Realms that allowed them to see in some instances of darkness.
Ultravision allowed a creature to see radiation in the ultraviolet spectrum, above what was possible by normal eyesight.
Creatures that possessed ultravision could see normally in outdoor, night time darkness as if they were in twilight. Capable of distinguishing colors, shapes, and even the relative position of objects. This was because Toril and many other planets were continually bombarded by ultraviolet radiation from stars and other celestial objects. In these conditions, creatures could see clearly out to . Beyond that and up to  away a creature could see things only dimly. On particularly cloudy nights, this visible range was reduced by half. 
As earth and stone screened out that radiation, this vision was of little use inside subterranean locations unless there were some form of ultravisual emanation. but would function in the Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane.
When underwater, the visible range for a creature with ultravision was typically half that of their land range. At ocean depths below  nothing could be seen, for ultraviolet light did not penetrate beyond that depth in sufficient quantities.
Spells and enchanted weapons that shed illumination typically would hamper this vision.
Several creatures were either known or believed to have the ability of seeing the world through ultravision. Some notable ones were
* The angels known as planetars and solars.
* The sprites known as atomies and grigs.

* The modrons known as pentadrones, quadrones, and tridrones.
