The '''Iltarch''' was one of the seats on the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]], and later the [[Council of Five (Amn)|Council of Five]], the ruling bodies that governed the nation of [[Amn]] during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. By [[1479 DR]], [[Ophal|House Ophal]] of [[Crimmor]] held this seat on the council.

==Responsibilities==
The Iltarch of Amn acted as the nation's main information-gathering officer. They kept a wide network of spies and freelance counter-intelligence agents to both gather details about the nation's rivals and obscure council activities to others. Thanks to the influence of [[Rhinnom Dannihyr|Grandmaster Rhinnom Dannihyr]], they had strong ties to the [[Shadow Thieves]], though in the 15{{th}} century this bond was kept with [[Dannihyr|House Dannihyr]] who had ascended to hold the seat of [[Tessarch]].

==Members==
* [[Curkon Gheldieg]] ([[1333 DR]] – [[1345 DR]])
* [[Phaan Colwyvv]] (1345 DR – [[1362 DR]])
* [[Rhinnom Dannihyr]] (1362 - ?)
