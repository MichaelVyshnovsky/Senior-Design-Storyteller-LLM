The '''Mulhorandi pantheon''' consisted of the [[Deity|deities]] worshiped in [[Mulhorand]]. Their domain was [[Heliopolis]].

==History==
When the [[Imaskar]]i captured the [[Mulan]] people and brought them to [[Toril]], the slaves also brought the worship of their deities. With help from [[Ao]], these deities were able to follow their worshipers and end their servitude.

After the destruction of [[Mulhorand]] by the [[Spellplague]], the Mulhorandi pantheon disappeared. In the wake of the [[Second Sundering]], and hearing again the plea of their people, the Mulhorandi gods returned to Toril and sent their [[Chosen]] to overthrow [[High Imaskar]] and to restore Mulhorand.

==Deities==
*[[Anhur]], god of war and weather; often associated with animals used for combat and hunting.
*[[Sharess|Bast]], goddess of hedonism, festhalls, love, and cats. She is called Sharess and is worshiped by that name outside of Mulhorand.
*[[Bes]], god of chance and luck.
*[[Geb]], god of the earth, minerals, and mining.
