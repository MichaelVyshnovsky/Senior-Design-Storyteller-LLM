The Mulhorandi pantheon consisted of the deities worshiped in Mulhorand. Their domain was Heliopolis.
When the Imaskari captured the Mulan people and brought them to Toril, the slaves also brought the worship of their deities. With help from Ao, these deities were able to follow their worshipers and end their servitude.
After the destruction of Mulhorand by the Spellplague, the Mulhorandi pantheon disappeared. In the wake of the Second Sundering, and hearing again the plea of their people, the Mulhorandi gods returned to Toril and sent their Chosen to overthrow High Imaskar and to restore Mulhorand.
