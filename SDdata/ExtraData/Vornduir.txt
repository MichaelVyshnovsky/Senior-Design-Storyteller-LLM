'''Vornduir''' was a powdered [[drug]] that was found in [[Faer√ªn]]. When inhaled it provided a variety of effects to the user, ranging from very mild to severe, annoying or even pleasureful.

==Description==
The drug vornduir was made from a mixture of 'essences' of certain animals and select [[herb]]s.

==Effects==
The primary effect of vornduir was a lack of physiological response to the effects of cold, even in extreme cases. Many users felt warm, content, and alert, even in near-freezing rain or snow. While they wouldn't go into shock or suffer lower internal body temperature, it was still possible for them to outright freeze solid in extreme cold.

Some of the side-effects caused were:
* No effect whatsoever,
* Mild itching and rashes, and
* Pain and pleasure stimuli being reversed for an hour (a cut gave pleasure where a tender caress brought agony).
