        "mainbody": "Antimagic was a type of spell effect that cancelled magic altogether. It was considered very powerful, being the supreme defense against magic, though it was itself the product of magic.\nUnlike dispel magic, it did not abort an active spell or magical effect, but merely suppressed it while it was in the antimagic-affected area.\nAntimagic was primarily produced by the antimagic field spell or by the beholders antimagic cone, which replicated the effects of antimagic field. Scalamagdrions were also known to have antimagic powers."
