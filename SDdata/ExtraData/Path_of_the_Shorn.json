Saib had a vision where the Gods of the Pantheon led him to believe that all of the hair on his body was excrement keeping him from attaining a higher spiritual state. From that day forward Saib begun practicing the \"Path of the Shorn\" by ritualistically shaving all of the hair from his body with a razor. Years later, Saib and the Shorn, settled in the ruins of Moradask where they discovered Ishistu, a living idol whom they worshiped as a rat god by covering his altar with their shorn hair.\nCategoryMiscellaneous pages\nCategoryYear of Miracles\ndf3jf1mm245gob46dqw9pv40jlaqjvo"
