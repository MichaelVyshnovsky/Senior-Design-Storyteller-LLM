        "History": "The Path of the Shorn was first realized by a [[Mystic (Zakhara)|mystic]] named [[Sa'ib al-Banu]] while adventuring in the jungles of the [[Cities of the Ancients]]. Sa'ib had a vision where the [[Gods of the Pantheon]] led him to believe that all of the hair on his body was excrement keeping him from attaining a higher spiritual state. From that day forward Sa'ib begun practicing the \"Path of the Shorn\" by ritualistically shaving all of the hair from his body with a razor. Years later, Sa'ib and the Shorn, settled in the ruins of Moradask where they discovered [[Ishistu]], a [[living idol]] whom they worshiped as a rat god by covering his altar with their shorn hair.",
