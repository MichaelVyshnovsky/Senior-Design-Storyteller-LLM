Page princes were not deemed nobles until they had completed the training required of them. It was the task of the house elderboy to train the page prince in manners.\n\nWhen a noble drow male was ten years of age and his [[weanmother]] had finished with him, he became a page prince. He was treated as such until deemed ready to become a noble by the noble females of the house.",
