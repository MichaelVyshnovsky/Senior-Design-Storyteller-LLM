Although most frequently used as an offensive ability, mind flayers used low-energy versions of ''mind blasts'' to slowly erode their victims' personality in order to produce more docile thralls.",
        "Effect": "A typical ''mind blast'' affected all sentient creatures within a {{SIAdj|60|ft}} cone emanating from the mind flayer. Anyone unable to resist suffered damage and was rendered stunned and unable to act for one minute. Mind flayers could also use a version of ''mind blast'' specifically designed to drain the psionic powers of a single target.\n\nA low-power version of ''mind blast'' could be applied to a victim over a period of 24 hours. The effect was the complete destruction of the victim's personality, leaving only a partially empty shell behind that could be easily trained into a perfectly docile thrall to serve the illithid colony's purpose.",
        "History": "Mind flayers typically used ''mind blasts'' to hunt, dragging off their stunned victims in order to feed on their brains. [[Cerebral hood]]s sometimes lingered around their lairs to overpower the stunned victims of their ''mind blasts'', forcing the creature to be a host, though otherwise cerebral hoods would rely upon their own comparatively weaker ''mind blasts''.<ref name=\"FF-p216>",
