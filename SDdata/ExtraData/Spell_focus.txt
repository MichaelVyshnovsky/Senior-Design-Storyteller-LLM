A spell focus or focus was a basic tool used in spellcasting.
A focus was simply an item of some kind that was necessary for successful casting of certain spells. Unlike material components, spell foci were not consumed by the casting of the spell and could be reused. Like material components, spell foci were usually small enough to store in a spell component pouch and were very cheap, but there were notable exceptions to this.
*Divine focus
*Material component
*Somatic component
*Verbal component
