{{otheruses|Focus (disambiguation)}}
A '''spell focus''' or '''focus''' was a basic tool used in spellcasting.

A focus was simply an item of some kind that was necessary for successful casting of certain spells. Unlike [[material component]]s, spell foci were not consumed by the casting of the spell and could be reused. Like material components, spell foci were usually small enough to store in a [[spell component pouch]] and were very cheap, but there were notable exceptions to this.
