        "mainbody": "eng shui (meaning wind and water) was the traditional Shou practice of divination.\nA master of feng shui could determine the ideal location for carrying out certain tasks like casting spells, making magical items, and building secure camps and fortifications. Feng shui was a part of Shou life in every way. A wise Shou citizen would always seek advice from the local feng shui master before setting up a home, creating a compound, or even moving the furniture. The master would give him advice on where to put his front entrance, how to arrange his furniture, and how to avoid bad locations when building. By carrying out these actions, bad luck or evil would be prevented.\nSome things encourage either good or bad feng shui. For instance\n* Good feng shui round doors and windows, red colors, a site near water, front gates with elaborate designs to frighten away evil, and windows and doors facing north.\n* Bad feng shui triangular doors and windows, black colors, doors facing the street, and windows and doors facing west."
