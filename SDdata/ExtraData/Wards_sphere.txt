The Wards sphere was a group of spells granted to crusaders and shamans to help protect items and geographical areas from harm or encroachment.
Many spells were available to those who had chosen this sphere.
Beginner spellcasters of this sphere could cast
* antivermin barrierThis is spelled "anti-vermin barrier" in the Tome of Magic 2nd edition (page 51) but the Players Option Spells & Magic sourcebook corrects this to "antivermin barrier".
* weighty chest
* ethereal barrier
Novice divine spellcasters were able to cast
* frisky chest
* zone of truth
Somewhat skilled spellcasters were able to cast
* efficacious monster ward
* invisibility purge
* squeaking floorsThis spell is listed as "squeaking floor" on page 188 of the Players Option Spells & Magic sourcebook, but the spell description on page 70 of Tome of Magic 2nd edition uses the plural form.
* thiefs lament
* zone of sweet air
Intermediate divine casters had the ability to use
* fire purge
* weather stasis
Those with a high level of skill had access to
* barrier of retention
* elemental forbiddanceThis spell was removed from the elemental sphere in the Players Option Spells & Magic sourcebook. See pages 186-187. This spell was added in the Tome of Magic 2nd edition as a wards sphere spell, but was listed in the elemental sphere on page 152. The Players Option Spells & Magic appears to have corrected this oversight.
* grounding
* shrieking walls
* undead ward
