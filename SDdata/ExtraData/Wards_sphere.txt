The '''Wards sphere''' was a group of spells granted to [[crusader]]s and [[shaman]]s to help protect items and geographical areas from harm or encroachment.

==Spells in the Sphere of Wards==
Many spells were available to those who had chosen this sphere.

Beginner spellcasters of this sphere could cast:
* ''[[antivermin barrier]]''<ref group="note">This is spelled "anti-vermin barrier" in the ''[[Tome of Magic 2nd edition]]'' (page 51) but the ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'' sourcebook corrects this to "antivermin barrier".
* ''[[weighty chest]]''
* ''[[ethereal barrier]]''
Novice divine spellcasters were able to cast:
* ''[[frisky chest]]''
* ''[[zone of truth]]''
Somewhat skilled spellcasters were able to cast:
* ''[[efficacious monster ward]]''
* ''[[invisibility purge]]''
* ''[[squeaking floors]]''<ref group="note">This spell is listed as "squeaking floor" on page 188 of the ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'' sourcebook, but the spell description on page 70 of ''[[Tome of Magic 2nd edition]]'' uses the plural form.
* ''[[thief's lament]]''
* ''[[zone of sweet air]]''
Intermediate divine casters had the ability to use:
* ''[[fire purge]]''
* ''[[weather stasis]]''
Those with a high level of skill had access to:
* ''[[barrier of retention]]''
* ''[[elemental forbiddance]]''<ref group="note">This spell was removed from the [[elemental sphere]] in the ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'' sourcebook. See pages 186-187. This spell was added in the ''[[Tome of Magic 2nd edition]]'' as a ''wards sphere'' spell, but was listed in the elemental sphere on page 152. The ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'' appears to have corrected this oversight.
* ''[[grounding]]''
* ''[[shrieking walls]]''
* ''[[undead ward]]''
Powerful spellcasters of such a sphere were able to cast:
* ''[[crushing walls]]''
* ''[[dragonbane]]''
* ''[[land of stability]]''
Divine spellcasters who had mastered this sphere could cast:
* ''[[tentacle walls]]''
