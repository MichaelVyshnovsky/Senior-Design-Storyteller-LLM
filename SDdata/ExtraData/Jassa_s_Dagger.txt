'''Jassa's Dagger''' was a [[dagger]]-shaped [[constellation]].

==Description==
This constellation consisted of a line of six stars, going from the large pink star known as the '''Pommel''' down to the handle and southwest-pointing blade of the dagger, intersected through the third star from the top by a line of four stars known as the '''Guards'''.

==Observation==
The constellation could be observed from [[Twilight Tor]] around the same time as the [[Simril]] festivities.

==Significance==
It was thought that people born under Jassa's Dagger tended to have great personal pride, as well as a tendency to hold grudges. Especially ambitious people and vendettists were often linked to this constellation.

==History==
Legend had it that this constellation was once the dagger of Queen [[Jassa]], ruler of the [[Jhaamdath]]an city [[Lirremar]]. When her reign came to an end due to her impalement on the end of a spear at the [[Battle of the Biting Serpent]], the queen threw her dagger into the night sky, where it remained as a constellation.
