Jassas Dagger was a dagger-shaped constellation.
This constellation consisted of a line of six stars, going from the large pink star known as the Pommel down to the handle and southwest-pointing blade of the dagger, intersected through the third star from the top by a line of four stars known as the Guards.
The constellation could be observed from Twilight Tor around the same time as the Simril festivities.
It was thought that people born under Jassas Dagger tended to have great personal pride, as well as a tendency to hold grudges. Especially ambitious people and vendettists were often linked to this constellation.
Legend had it that this constellation was once the dagger of Queen Jassa, ruler of the Jhaamdathan city Lirremar. When her reign came to an end due to her impalement on the end of a spear at the Battle of the Biting Serpent, the queen threw her dagger into the night sky, where it remained as a constellation.
