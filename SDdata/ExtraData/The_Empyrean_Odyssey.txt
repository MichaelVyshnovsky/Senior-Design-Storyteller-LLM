{{DEFAULTSORT:Empyrean Odyssey, The}}
'''The Empyrean Odyssey''' was a trilogy of novels written by [[Thomas M. Reid]]. The trilogy was initially published as separate novels; in 2011, the trilogy was published as an omnibus.

==Synopsis==
{{quote|''[[Aliisza]] and [[Kaanyr Vhok]] have returned from their attempted invasion of Menzoberranzan and set their sights on [[Sundabar]]. But before she can complete a mission in that besieged city, Aliisza finds herself in the one place a [[demon]] would never want to go, no matter how sure she is of her wits and cunning: the very heart of [[Celestia]].''<br/>

''But Aliisza soon discovers that being held captive in Celestia is just a distraction for a far deeper and more deadly scheme. One that threatens all of the [[Forgotten Realms]] world. One that, as much as she hates to admit it, the angels of Celestia really should know about. But how is she going to convince the [[angel]]s that she, a demon, could have more in mind than destruction?''<br/>

''The Empyrean Odyssey features the return of popular characters Aliisza and Kaanyr Vhok, from Thomas Reid's ''[[Insurrection]]'', the second book in the New York Times best-selling series, [[R.A. Salvatore]]'s [[War of the Spider Queen]]. Forgotten Realms fans won't want to miss this epic tale of two fiends struggling to escape the heart of a deeply troubled Celestia.''}}
