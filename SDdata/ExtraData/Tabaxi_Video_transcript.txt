Who were the tabaxi?
Who were the tabaxi? [/tɑːˈbæksi/ ta-BÆK-see]
The tabaxi were an elusive race of feline humanoids originally from the continent of Maztica [/mɑːzˈtikɑː/ mahz-TEE-ka], far to the west of Faerûn [/feɪˈruːn/ fay-ROON]. They also had a notable population in the deep jungles of Chult.
Most tabaxi were taller than humans, with slender and lithe bodies. They were skilled at both climbing and swimming, with a keen sense of balance. Some called the tabaxi "jaguar people" or "leopard men" because of the spots or stripes found in their yellow-to-red-colored fur. Others called them "cat-men". Like most cats, tabaxi had slit-pupilled eyes long, flexible tails and retractable claws, which they sometimes used in combat.
However, tabaxi were just as likely to use weapons in battle, such as bolas, slings, macas, javelins, or atlatls. They were exceptional hunters with a keen sense of smell. Combined with their speed, agility, stealth, and natural camouflage, they made for challenging foes. Nevertheless, they had few enemies and would not attack unless they had strong reason to do so.
The tabaxi were a reclusive people who often avoided other intelligent races, so meeting one was uncommon. They lived in small clans led by elders, who were aided by shamans. Some clans were nomadic others lived in small villages of ramadas made from wooden poles with grass roofs.
The tabaxi of Maztica spoke an ancient form of the Payit [/ˈpajɪt/ PIE-yit] language, and most clans worshiped Tezca, Nula, or Azul.
