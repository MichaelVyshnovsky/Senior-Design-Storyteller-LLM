The mystical energies used in his attempt brought back many demons that infested what was thereafter called the Dunwood. They slew the blightlords, followers of the Rotting man, and eventually the Rotting Man himself died, leaving future Nentyarchs to battle the demons.\nCategoryTitles\n4a4kp14c0kkgcqg49gbulw8ygj1gl4k"
