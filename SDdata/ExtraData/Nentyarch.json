        "History": "The first Nentyarch, [[Thargaun Crell]], created [[Dun-Tharos]] in the [[Rawlinswood]] in {{Yearlink|-970}} and forged the [[Crown of Narfell]] the same year, before uniting the various [[Nar]] realms under his rule.\n\nThe last true Nentyarch was [[Rheligaun Darakh|Rheligaun \"the Horned\"]], but he disappeared after the fall of the empire.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|722}}, the leader of the druid circle of [[Circle of Leth|Leth]] claimed the title of Nentyarch when he occupied Dun-Tharos in the Rawlinswood and erected a tree-fortress around it.\n\nWhen the [[Rotting Man]] came to the Rawlinswood in the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, it sparked a conflict that ended in the {{YearlinkName|1371}} when the Rotting Man and his forces overran Dun-Tharos and the Nentyarch and his circle had to flee the blighted forest and go south into the [[Forest of Lethyr]] to [[Yeshelmaar]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the Rotting Man became trapped in Dun-Tharos after he failed to create a divine abomination. The mystical energies used in his attempt brought back many [[demon]]s that infested what was thereafter called the [[Dunwood]]. They slew the [[blightlord]]s, followers of the Rotting man, and eventually the Rotting Man himself died, leaving future Nentyarchs to battle the demons.<ref>",
