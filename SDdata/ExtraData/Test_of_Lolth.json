        "Society": "Lolth urged her drow to work and fight against each other and she wanted to determine whether her followers were worthy&mdash;in this case, loyal and strong&mdash;enough to be supported by her. These two aspects were examined together in the Test of Lolth. Drow who grew to an exceptional degree of power were subjected to it.",
        "Procedure": {
            "Result": "There were several possible outcomes for this test and each had a different effect.\n;The subject won and killed the enemy\n:In this scenario, the test subject could take anything from the defeated foe's corpse and was empowered for a month.\n;The subject died\n:In this scenario, the test subject's soul was drained by Lolth.\n;Any other scenario\n:In any scenario where the subject did not win and/or kill the enemy, the test subject was turned into a [[drider]].\n\nThe enemy could be rewarded with a similar power boost if she or he won, but it could also happen that the enemy suffered a loss of memory regarding the entire event, or Lolth might expose her or him for the murder, which usually resulted in their execution for open murder, or to be more precise being discovered for murder, which was a crime in drow society."
