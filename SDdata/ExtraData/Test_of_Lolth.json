These two aspects were examined together in the Test of Lolth. Drow who grew to an exceptional degree of power were subjected to it.\nAs mentioned above, the Test of Lolth existed to determine the loyalty and strength of a given drow. The strength part was fulfilled by the test being essentially a battle to the death between the test subject and another, slightly stronger person. The loyalty part was fulfilled by Lolth relaying a false message to the other combatant&mdashsomeone close to the test subject such as a friend, family member, or ally&mdashclaiming that they would be chosen for the Spider Queens favor if she or he would kill the test subject. If no suitable person existed, then a cleric of Lolth who was not particularly devout was chosen.\nThere were several possible outcomes for this test and each had a different effect.\nThe subject won and killed the enemy\nIn this scenario, the test subject could take anything from the defeated foes corpse and was empowered for a month.\nThe subject died\nIn this scenario, the test subjects soul was drained by Lolth.\nAny other scenario\nIn any scenario where the subject did not win and/or kill the enemy, the test subject was turned into a drider.\nThe enemy could be rewarded with a similar power boost if she or he won, but it could also happen that the enemy suffered a loss of memory regarding the entire event, or Lolth might expose her or him for the murder, which usually resulted in their execution for open murder, or to be more precise being discovered for murder, which was a crime in drow society.\nCategoryRituals\nt0sf7lss58dsrmg5zhygin9hqtfnz6j"
