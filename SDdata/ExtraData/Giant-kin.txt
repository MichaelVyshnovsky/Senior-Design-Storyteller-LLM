'''Giant-kin''' were large [[humanoid]]s related to the true [[giant]]s. Any race that could trace its lineage back to [[Othea]]'s relationship with [[Ulutiu]] could be considered giant-kin. The mother of all giants, Othea, cheated on her husband [[Annam All-Father]], the father of giants, with Ulutiu, producing the [[firbolg]]s, [[fomorian]]s, [[verbeeg]]s, and the [[voadkyn]]. All true giants considered these types of giant-kin [[Giant dictionary#M|''maug'']] because of this act of unfaithfulness.

==History==
Despite the usual reluctance of giant-kin to interact with other giant-kin species, the coming of the [[Twilight Spirit]] increased the activity of [[giant|true giant]] tribes in the [[Ice Spires]], leading to concerns among giant-kin for their own protection, and some resulting cooperation between the species.

==Ecology==
A typical giant-kin pregnancy was nine months, and the offspring took around eighteen years to reach maturity.<ref name=GC-p24">

==Society==
Giant-kin did not generally associate with different types of giant-kin. Within their own tribes, they were bound by the [[ordning (social structure)|ordning]] (except [[firbolg]]s), and when they did interact with other giant species, they were ranked below all others, except [[ogre]]s. Most giant-kin were under the impression that one day, they would be accepted back into "true giant" society and be accepted by their half-brothers.

==Main types of giant-kin==
* [[Firbolg]]s 
* [[Verbeeg]]s 
* [[Voadkyn]]
* [[Fomorian]]s

==Other types==
The [[ogre]]s were created during Othea's affair with [[Vaprak]], and as a result were despised as giant-kin by true giants. [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]] and [[cyclopskin]] were of unknown descent but were believed to be the product of another of Othea's affairs.
