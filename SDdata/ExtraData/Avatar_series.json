        "mainbody": "'''Avatar series''', originally the '''Avatar trilogy''', is a series of novels detailing the events of the [[Time of Troubles]]. \n\nThe original three books were set from [[Kythorn]] 1 to [[Marpenoth]] 15.\n\nThe books are:\n\n# ''[[Shadowdale (novel)|Shadowdale]]'' by [[Scott Ciencin]], originally under the pen-name 'Richard Awlinson' (April 1989)\n# ''[[Tantras (novel)|Tantras]]'' by [[Scott Ciencin]], originally under the pen-name 'Richard Awlinson' (June 1989)\n# ''[[Waterdeep (novel)|Waterdeep]]'' by [[Troy Denning]], originally under the pen-name 'Richard Awlinson' (August 1989)\n# ''[[Prince of Lies (novel)|Prince of Lies]]'' by [[James Lowder]] (August 1993)\n# ''[[Crucible: The Trial of Cyric the Mad]]'' by Troy Denning (February 1998)\n\nThe artwork for the covers of the books were provided by [[Brom]].\n\nThe first three works center around [[Kelemvor]], [[Adon]] of [[Sune]], [[Midnight]], and [[Cyric]], and their search for the [[Tablets of Fate]], divine tablets that hold a listing of the Gods and their roles in the balance of Law and Chaos, during the Time of Troubles. The theft of these tablets was the actual cause of the Time of Troubles as all the gods with the exception of [[Helm]] were cast to Toril and faiths and magic ran wild.\n\nThe last two books in the series account for what occurred after the Tablets were returned to [[Ao]], including the aftermath of the ascension of several Company members to godhood (Midnight took the mantle of [[Mystra]], Kelemvor became god of the dead, and Cyric took several vile deities' portfolios and went mad).\n[[Category:Novel series]]\nc8xvtbl9oi7r0yeanoykdo8kwsruvsu"
