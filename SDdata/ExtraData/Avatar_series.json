The theft of these tablets was the actual cause of the Time of Troubles as all the gods with the exception of Helm were cast to Toril and faiths and magic ran wild.\nThe last two books in the series account for what occurred after the Tablets were returned to Ao, including the aftermath of the ascension of several Company members to godhood (Midnight took the mantle of Mystra, Kelemvor became god of the dead, and Cyric took several vile deities portfolios and went mad).\nCategoryNovel series\nc8xvtbl9oi7r0yeanoykdo8kwsruvsu"
