The '''Empires of the Alamber Sea''' was a collective term used in the late 14th century and through most of the 15th century [[DR]] to describe the empires of [[High Imaskar]] and [[Okoth]]. Although not technically an empire, people also usually associated the nation of [[Tymanther]] with this term as well.
