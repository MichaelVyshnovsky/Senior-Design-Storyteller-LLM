Al-Qadim is set in the land of Zakhara, called the “Land of Fate.” Thematically, the land of Zakhara is a blend of the historical Arabian Empire and stories of legend.\nZakhara is a peninsula on the continent of Faerûn in the world of Toril, the locale of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, although Al-Qadim is designed to stand on its own or be added to any existing campaign setting. The basic campaign setting was divided between two game products Al-Qadim Arabian Adventures, a sourcebook describing character creation rules, equipment, and spells unique to the setting, and Al-Qadim Land of Fate, a boxed set describing the land of Zakhara, with separate sourcebooks for the players and the Dungeon Master.\nThere are a number of important concepts to the Zakharan culture including honor, family, social station, purity, piety, and hospitality.\nZakharan society is broken into two main divisions\n* Al-Badia The nomadic desert people.\n* Al-Hadhar The city people.\nZakharas society is made up mainly of humans, but demihumans such as elves and dwarves are present in the setting also, as well as humanoids such as orcs, goblinoids, and ogres. Unlike most settings, there is practically no racial disharmony in Zakhara humans, elves, and orcs alike share the same culture, lifestyle, and social status, and races traditionally considered evil savages, such as goblins, are instead valued members of society. The nomadic Al-Badia are predominantly human, whereas the Al-Hadhar possess greater diversity. The nomads and city-dwellers, humans and non-humans alike, are all united as a single culture under a single religion (a polytheistic pastiche of Islam) and as subjects of the Grand Caliph the entire continent is effectively a single empire, although different regions, city-states, and tribes have unique local cultures.\nNot all inhabitants of Zakhara belong to the shared culture, however there are many tribes of pagan human barbarians who reject the Law of the Loregiver and the worship of the Pantheon, and certain monstrous races—including the yuan-ti, the vile yak-men (or yikaria, as they call themselves), and most giants—dwell apart in their own societies.\nThe people of Zakhara speak and write a common language called Midani (represented by Arabic).\nZakhara has a wide variety of gods, but all recognize the power of Fate. Fate may cast down the mightiest sultan or raise up the meanest beggar. None can agree on her nature, whether the mother of the gods or an elemental force. All acknowledge her power, however. In Dungeons & Dragons game terms, Fate is not given statistics, spells, or priesthoods as are most deities.\nIn the distant past, a woman known only as the Loregiver penned the scrolls that clearly laid out the laws of the land, some say guided by the hand of Fate. The wisdom of this Lore was immediately recognized and became the basis of law in Zakhara. The vast majority of Al-Hadhar and most Al-Badia are Enlightened in the way of the Loregiver.\nPlayer characters in the Al-Qadim setting can choose from any of a number of character types. Al-Qadim makes use of the concept of character kits, a more rigid layer atop the traditional Dungeons & Dragons character classes. These kits are generally available to all characters, with certain restrictions based on the race of the character.\nAll races are present, including humans, elves, dwarves, half-elves, gnomes, and halflings, although they do not suffer many of the racial prejudices traditional to most Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings. Non-human characters are rarer than they are in other traditional Dungeons & Dragons settings, including the rest of Abeir-Toril.\nKits described in the core campaign setting are as follows\n* Askar a kind of citizen warrior.\n* Corsair Sea-born warriors your typical swashbuckler.\n* Desert rider Nomadic fighters who ride horses and camels across the desert.\n* Faris Holy warriors fighting for their faith and their people.\n* Mamluk A slave warrior noted for the special tattoos they wear.\n* Mercenary barbarian Warriors from abroad who come to fight for money, fame, or power.\n* Outland warrior A fighter truly foreign to the land of Zakhara.\n* Elemental mage A master of one of the four elements sand (earth), sea (water), flame (fire), or wind (air).\n* Shair A wizard whose magic centers on genies and is aided by its familiar, a gen (minor genie).\n* Sorcerer A wizard who deals with two elemental forces. They are the most common mages in Zakhara.\n* Ajami Any outland wizard from beyond the Land of Fate.\n* Jackal A wizard who steals spells from other wizards.\n* Astrologer A wizard who studied the stars and used the constellations to augment their powers.\n* Clockwork mage (Mechanician) A wizard who created mechanical constructs possessing spell-like abilities.\n* Digitalogist A wizard specializing in the special connection between numbers and magic.\n* Ghul Lord A wizard using the Negative Energy plane to power their magic.\n* Mageweaver A wizard who wove magical power into artistic creations.\n* Mystic of Nog A wizard who channeled and contained magical power through their flesh.\n* Spellslayer A wizard who directly attacked the magic of another wizard.\n* Baule diviner A diviner who gets insight from Fate throught the elements.\n* Saluk A free man or woman who follows his or her own path.\n* Barber Experts in the ways of the bazaar and the city.\n* Beggar-thief Often overlooked by others, beggar thieves can go places others would be noticed.\n* Holy slayer An assassin working for a secretive order.\n* Matrud Cast out of their tribes, these individuals make their own way in the Land of Fate.\n* Merchant-rogue Masters of the mercantile arts, these individuals carry their trade from town to town.\n* Rawun The story-tellers and bards of Zakharan society.\n* Pragmatist The most liberal and common of all priests, the pragmatist tries to adapt their faith to the everyday world.\n* Ethoist Conservative priests who promote a particular path.\n* Moralist The most conservative and intolerant among the priests.\n* Hakima Wise women who serve as valuable advisors to the outer tribes.\n* Kahin These are the idol-priests of Zakhara, and often champions of nature.\n* Mystic Hermitic priests who tend to visit populous centers to deliver prophetic pronouncements.\n* Outland priest A priest who follows a faith foreign to the Land of Fate.\nAl-Qadim had a number of support products released before the line came to an end.
