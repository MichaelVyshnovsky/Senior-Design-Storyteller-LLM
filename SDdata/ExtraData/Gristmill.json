Across the Dragon Reach and Sword Coast, most millers charged one bag for every seven, though some took only one for every eight bags when dealing with long-standing customers. In the Dalelands, local lords made sure that the mills in their land operated at a fair price.\nthumb|200px|A common mill.\nAcross the Realms there were four types of gristmills, each named for the manner by which their millstones were powered.\nMagicmill The most atypical type of mill, these were powered by various magical means and usually created when no other motive force was an option. This could include such things as millstones powered by golems or stones enspelled with a permanent animate object effect. These were most commonly found in Halruaa and Thay.\nWatermill Mills whose millstones were moved by waterwheels, which turned by means of water passing beneath it or flowing over its top. This usually required the mill to be located at a waterfall or river, though some managed to run off a diverted flow from nearby rivers.\nWheelmill Mills whose millstones were powered by means of humans (typically slaves) or animals, which dragged or pushed large beams affixed to the upper stone. or oxen. The limitations of living motive forces restricted this type of mill to small operations.\nWindmill Mills whose millstones were powered similarly to waterwheels, but by means of wind catching in great vanes. These were typically found in areas with strong and steady breezes, such as along coastlines.\nthumb|275px|An overview of Ilmurk Jongraths horse-driven wheelmill as an example.\n* Chasler Belvrost owned a flourmill along the River Reddan.\n* Deltars Mill, a haunted gristmill in Eveningstar operated by Deltar Tummarlin.\n* The Eastern Farmlands of Daggerford had a gristmill that acted as one of the major sources of food for the town.
