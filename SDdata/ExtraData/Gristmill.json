        "Description": "The cereal grains that were ground up in gristmills included such crops as [[barley]],{{ Cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)/Shadowdale|16}} [[wheat]],\n\nMills operated by having farmers pay their operator, known as a \"miller,\" a percentage of their ground grains in return for the use of their mill. Across the [[Dragon Reach]] and [[Sword Coast]], most millers charged one bag for every seven, though some took only one for every eight bags when dealing with long-standing customers. In [[the Dalelands]], local lords made sure that the mills in their land operated at a fair price.<ref><ref>",
        "Types of Mills": {
            "Magicmill": "The most atypical type of mill, these were powered by various [[magic]]al means and usually created when no other motive force was an option. This could include such things as millstones powered by [[golem]]s or stones enspelled with a [[permanency|permanent]] ''[[animate object]]'' effect. These were most commonly found in [[Halruaa]] and [[Thay]].",
            "Watermill": "Mills whose millstones were moved by waterwheels, which turned by means of water passing beneath it or flowing over its top. This usually required the mill to be located at a waterfall or river, though some managed to run off a diverted flow from nearby rivers.",
            "Wheelmill": "Mills whose millstones were powered by means of [[human]]s (typically slaves) or [[animal]]s, which dragged or pushed large beams affixed to the upper stone.{{Cite dragon/304/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Jongrath's Mill|78}} or [[oxen]]. The limitations of living motive forces restricted this type of mill to small operations.",
            "Windmill": "Mills whose millstones were powered similarly to waterwheels, but by means of wind catching in great vanes. These were typically found in areas with strong and steady breezes, such as along coastlines."
