        "mainbody": "ey mounds were hidden burial barrows of wild fey, which often contained treasures buried with the fey. The soil from fey mounds was thought to be magical, hallowed as if effected by the hallow spell, and displayed additional effects such as confusion or hallucinatory terrain. Because of this, individuals highly attuned to magic could sometimes sense a mounds presence and some used them in rituals to increase the fertility of fields.\nMounds were often protected by illusionary magic which could charm trespassers or cause them to fall asleep.  Living fey zealously guarded mounds and punished those who disturbed their kinsmens eternal rest."
