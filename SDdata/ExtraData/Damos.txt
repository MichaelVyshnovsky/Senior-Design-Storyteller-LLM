The '''Damos''' was a powerful artifact of [[Imaskari]] origin.  It appeared as a round, [[silver]] disk with a reservoir holding black fluid in the center.  Anyone drinking the liquid was able to see the future with certainty.  An unfortunate side effect was that the liquid was a deadly poison.  As of [[1479 DR]] one of the Damos was in the possession of the [[Rakshasa]] [[Kalkan]].

As of {{yearlink|1374}}, there were 21 Damos in [[Deep Imaskar]]. Each of the Damos was in the possession of a [[imaskari vengeance taker|Vengeance Taker]], who needed to acclimate themselves to their poison in order to draw out their full power: the Damos not only allowed them to see the future, but also granted them many other powers.{{cite book/Darkvision|7-9}}
