'''Sancitified magic''' was a type of magic.

Sanctified magic required the caster to be completely and utterly devoted to good. Sanctified spells were incredibly powerful. However, they could only be cast with a significant sacrifice from the caster. Evil spellcasters were unable to cast any sanctified spell.

Sanctified spells were prepared just as normal spells. Unprepared sanctified spells could only be used from a scroll. Sanctified spells usually required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components but rarely a [[material component]]. Some also required a [[divine focus]]. All sanctified spells were temporary and expired.

All sanctified spells required a sacrifice from the caster. The sacrifice required varied, from a temporary draining of the caster's strength to their life itself. The sacrifice occured when the spell expired.

A sanctified spell could be made into an item, such as a potion, scroll or wand. Any individual of good-alignment could use said item, and the required sacrifice was taken from them instead of the individual who created the item.

Sanctified spells were unique in that they were neither an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] nor a [[divine magic|divine]] spell. Good-aligned [[druid]]s, [[paladin]]s, [[ranger]]s, [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s could all cast a sanctified spell, but [[cleric]]s can spontaneously cast any sanctified spell.
