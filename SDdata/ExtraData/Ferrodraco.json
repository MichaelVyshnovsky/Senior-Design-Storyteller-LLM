        "mainbody": "''Ferrodraco''''' was a genus of prehistoric [[proto-dragon]]s.",
        "History": "Scholars from [[Candlekeep]] believed that ferrodracos were an evolved and more intelligent species of the ''[[Ignidraco]]'' genus. It was theorized that, unlike the ferocious [[inficedraco]]s, ''Ferrodraco'' species favored an intellectual and more social behavior, developing a level of intelligence superior to that of the inficedracos.\n\nSupporters of the proto-dragon theory believed that metallic dragons mentioned in historical documents written before that period of time, such as the ''[[Parwiccan Cycle]]'' and other similar documents, were in fact members of the ''Ferrodraco'' genus."
