Once the parties agreed on enclave construction, the terms of the deal were discussed. All enclaves required that the local government agree to the Three Laws of the Enclave as follows:\n* The Law of Sovereignty: The enclave was treated as Thayan soil much like an embassy.\n* The Law of Trade: Merchandise and services were priced at 10% below normal retail cost.\n* The Law of Crafting: This dictated what Thayans would and would not sell to the general public.\n\nThe enclave benefited the local rulers since the Thayans agreed to donate 1% of the profits to the local government. Most enclave contracts also required that [[wizard]]s serve in the reserves of the local military for brief and recurring periods, which increased the number of spellcasters available to the government.[[File:3e Faerûn thayanenclaves.jpg|border|right|frameless|379x379px]]",
        "Trivia": "''Circa'' [[1372 DR]], the ruling priestesses of [[Dambrath]] considered copying the idea of the enclave from the Red Wizards of Thay, by combining a trade outpost and a worship center for [[Loviatar]].",
        "Known Enclaves": "The following cities had large Thayan enclaves around [[1372 DR]]:\n* [[Athkatla]]\n* [[Baldur's Gate]]\n* [[Calaunt]]\n* [[Calimport]]\n* [[Cimbar]]\n* [[Hillsfar]]\n* [[Hlath]]\n* [[Hlondeth]]\n* [[Innarlith]]\n* [[Iriaebor]]\n* [[Marsember]]\n* [[Messemprar]]\n* [[Mulmaster]]\n* [[Procampur]]\n* [[Proskur]]: The [[Thayan enclave (Proskur)|enclave]] of Proskur brought significant wealth to the leaders of the [[Dragon Coast]] city.\n* [[Ravens Bluff]]\n* [[Saerloon]]\n* [[Scardale]]: Despite their reputation elsewhere, the Red Wizards of the [[Thayan enclave (Scardale)|enclave]] in [[Scardale Town]] were rather trusted by the local Dalesfolk.\n* [[Scornubel]]\n* [[Soorenar]]\n* [[Telflamm]]\n*[[Rose Keep|Veltalar]]: (founded later)\n* [[Waterdeep]]: Technically placed in [[Skullport]] and connected to their mundane offices in the city proper.[<nowiki/>[[citation needed]]]\n* [[Westgate]]\n* [[Yhaunn]]",
