'''''Reindeer hooves''''' was a unique [[magic]]al ability used by [[ice hunter shaman]]s, who were [[specialty priest]]s of [[Ulutiu]], of the [[Great Glacier]] whose totem animal was [[Pindalpau-pau|Pindalpau-pau the Reindeer Mother]].

==Powers==
''Reindeer hooves'' bestowed a greatly enhanced movement rate for the ice hunter shaman. Additionally, the power granted them secure footing on any type of ice.

The ice hunter shaman could use this ability on themselves or convey it to another person. ''Reindeer hooves'' could be called upon once per day and lasted for up to one full hour.
