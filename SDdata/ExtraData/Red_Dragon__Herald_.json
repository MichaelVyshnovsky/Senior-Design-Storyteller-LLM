The sign of this office was a rampant metallic-red dragon with wings unfurled and mouth open with teeth bared. Traditionally, this office was given to a young Herald Pursuivant who was a bit more radical and had fresh ideas for the future. Youthful enthusiasm led to Red Dragon playing the role of diplomat and matchmaker, arranging marriages between the hundreds of noble houses and helping create the coat-of-arms for their marriage shield and those of any children.The source does not explicitly state this, but on page 102 of Power of Faerûn it says that most realms in Faerûn follow the \"classic\" rules of real-world British heraldry as administered by the College of Arms, which means marriages resulted in modifications to the arms of both houses by the techniques of dimidiation, impalement, or quartering. Another tradition was that Red Dragon escorted supplicants, heirs, and honorees to ceremonies pertaining to the transfer or attainment of titles, positions, or awards of honor. The residence given to this office was a fortification called Dragonrise, located south of Easting near the headwaters of the southern tributary of the River Chionthar.\nDuring the tenures of Lady Anaethe and Lady Bluthba, this office gained a reputation of decadence and ardent self-indulgence, but a successor (Bellym Glarsh) struck a different tone by being either less licentious or more cautious.\nThe wooden rod of office had an exquisite carving of a dragons head on top that could generate flaming spheres. The rod itself was enchanted to be impervious to fire.\n* Lady Anaethe (unknown)\n* Lady Bluthba (unknown)\n* Bellym Glarsh (circa 1368 DR)\n__NOTOC__\nCategoryHigh Heralds\nCategoryTitles\np358o7kb27p0kdokd6mozrcedcoxsu6"
