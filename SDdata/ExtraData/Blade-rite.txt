The ritual of '''Blade-rite''' was an [[elf|elven]] [[ritual]] that involved the drawing of a magical sword to determine the worthiness of its wielder for a given assignment or position among the hierarchy of the elves. It was most closely associated with the drawing of the famous [[Elfblade]]s, used to determine the [[Coronal]] of [[Cormanthyr]], and his two Defenders, the [[Arms-Major]] and the [[Spell-Major]].

==Nature of the Rite==
The potent and ancient Blade-rite was always attended and closely governed by two elven [[Elven High Magic|High Mages]]. During the ritual, the sword's magic was enhanced by High Magic, creating a powerful test for any potential ruler. The testing challenged the would-be wielder's practical skills, their reasoning, and their character, and these tests occurred completely within the imagination of the candidate, privy only to himself and the two High Mages. Should the elf pass all three tests, he or she rose to the rank befitting the blade. Should they fail, however, certain consequences would befall him or her as befitting the blade he or she had drawn.
