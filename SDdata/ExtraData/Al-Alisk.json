        "mainbody": "he Al-Alisk clan were desert dwellers living close to the southern end of Raurin. They eventually died off to the Curse of Amun-Re, and a blood feud with the people of Akhir and Pazar however, they continued to rise nightly upon death to do battle with these enemies.\nAt some point in the late 3 century DR, Sithal Al-Husn, a princess of Pazar, was kidnapped from the streets of Akhir on her wedding night by a man named Habrauk Al-Nirin, of the Al-Alisk clan. This set off a blood feud which, combined with the Curse of Amun-Re, completely wiped out the bloodlines of the Al-Alisk clan, the city of Akhir, and the royal line of Pazar within five generations.\nThe Al-Alisk Clan buried their dead in the Crypt of Al-Alisk, which was approximately  east by northeast of Akhir. Even after the destruction of the clan, they rose nightly to guard the crypt against the Lancers of Death until the year , when adventurers released the frozen princess of Pazar."
