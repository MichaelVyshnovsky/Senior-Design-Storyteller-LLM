        "mainbody": "ile:Baneblades.jpg|thumb|The Baneblades.]]The '''Baneblades of Demron''' were six powerful magic [[sword]]s forged for the defenders of [[Myth Drannor]] before its fall. The  archmage [[Demron]] was credited with their creation over some three centuries, but they were cooperative efforts among all the races that dwelled in Myth Drannor.\n\nEach was designed for a member of a particular race or profession, and their magic ceased to function for anyone else, leaving only a nonmagical weapon of otherwise fine quality. They were imbued with holy energy and were particularly effective against [[outsider]]s (those from planes other than the [[Prime Material Plane]]) and [[undead]], and glowed with the light of a [[torch]] on command. Each also had their own unique powers.\n\n;[[Faervian]]: \n: This [[longsword]] shone with a deep purple shimmer.\n;[[Mhaorathil]]: \n: Wieldable by [[dwarves]], this [[short sword]] glowed with an orange hue.\n;[[Evaelathil]]: \n: This green-glowing blade could only be used by [[halfling]]s.\n;[[Morvian]]: \n: Shining with a yellow, sun-like light, this [[greatsword]] was intended to be held by [[human]]s.\n;[[Dragathil]]: \n: A medium-sized [[rapier]], this blade glowed red and also held creatures in place.\n; [[Keryvian]]: \n: This [[broadsword]] was once wielded by [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]], Captain of Myth Drannor.",
        "Creation and History": "In [[346 DR]], several senior and junior officers were exiled from Myth Drannor after it was revealed that they had subjected their non-elven troops to horrendous treatment and for willingly sacrificing them in favor of elven troops, especially in the [[Darkwoods Massacre]].\n\nMajor [[Pirphal Faerondaryl]] offered his resignation for his failure to notice the problem, but [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]] refused it and instructed him to work to remedy the issue. Major Pirphal then commissioned the first three of the Baneblades as weapons for his new lieutenants: one is a [[halfling]], the other a [[dwarf]], and the third a [[human]]. These blades were dwarven-forged, the hilts were of elven make, and the human archmage [[Demron]] was asked to enchant them.\n\nTwelve years later in [[358 DR]]. Demron completed the enchanting of the first three baneblades. By [[398 DR]], the baneblade ''Morvian'' was held by Lady [[Ahskahala Durothil]], the previous owner having been killed in the ''Night Dragon's Attack'' skirmish earlier that year.\n\nBy [[460 DR]], the archmage Demron was asked to complete another baneblade, though this one was for the [[Akh'Faer|Spell-Major]], since the traditional sword for that post, the ''[[Artblade|Ary'Faern'Kerym]]'', was lost 10 years earlier by [[Zaos Durothil]] when he attempted to fight off the red dragon [[Edallisufanxar]]. This blade was known as ''Faervian'', and was completed only two years later in [[462 DR]]. This was the only one created for the [[Akh'Faer]], the arcane branch of the army.\n\nIn [[574 DR]], Demron was asked once again to craft another baneblade, a fifth one, to serve as the blade for the [[Akh'Velahr|Arms-Major]] of the [[Akh'Velahr]] (the normal standing army of Cormanthyr). It was completed later that year and named ''Dragathil''.\n\nThe last of the baneblades, ''Keryvian'', was completed by Demron in [[633 DR]] for the Arms-Major position once again, since the previous baneblade ''Dragathil'' was lost in [[590 DR]] when Arms-Major Pirphal died fighting the black dragon Mrinabnahor. ''Keryvian'' was said to be the most powerful of the baneblades. Exhausted by its creation, Demron died only two days later.",
