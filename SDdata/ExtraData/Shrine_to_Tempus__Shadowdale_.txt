In Shadowdale, the Shrine to Tempus is an altar of black basalt framed by two iron pillars. 
The front of the altar bears a golden symbol of Tempus. Flowers are often left here in remembrance of fallen warriors. 
The Shrine to Tempus is located north of Druids Grove, and is on the east side of the Shadowdale Trail. 
The Shrine to Tempus was originally built to commemorate the Second Battle of Shadowdale, and honor those who have perished throughout the years defending Shadowdale.
