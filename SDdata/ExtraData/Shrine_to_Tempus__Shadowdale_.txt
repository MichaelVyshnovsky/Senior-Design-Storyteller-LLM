In [[Shadowdale]], the '''Shrine to Tempus''' is an altar of black [[basalt]] framed by two [[iron]] pillars. 

The front of the altar bears a golden symbol of [[Tempus]]. Flowers are often left here in remembrance of fallen warriors. 

The Shrine to Tempus is located north of [[Druid's Grove]], and is on the east side of the [[Shadowdale Trail]]. 

==History==
The Shrine to Tempus was originally built to commemorate the Second [[Battle of Shadowdale]], and honor those who have perished throughout the years defending Shadowdale.
