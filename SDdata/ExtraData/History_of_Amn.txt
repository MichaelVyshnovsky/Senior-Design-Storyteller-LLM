The '''history of [[Amn]]''' dates back to its independence from the [[Shoon Imperium]], following that realm's collapse in [[450 DR]].

==Pre-history==
[[Human]] habitation of the lands that would become Amn dated all the way back to the emigration of [[elves]] from [[Faerie]]. Primitive human tribes were native to the region and lived under the boughs of the elven realm of [[Keltormir]]. [[Dragon]] fires eventually burned down the forests<ref> and the humans (as well as some [[wemic]]s<ref>) settled the cleared plains.

During the [[History of Calimshan#Third Age|Third Age of Calimshan]], these plains were alternately known as the Lake Lands among the Mountains, or, more commonly, the [[Calishar Emirates]],<ref> and were home to a rare few villages, hunting lodges and [[Calishite]] garrisons, populated by both native humans and immigrants from [[Calimshan]].

During the time of the Shoon Imperium, three cities were founded in what was, at the time, called the Emirate of Amin between the {{YearlinkName|100}} and the {{YearlinkName|212}}. The founding of [[Athkatla]], [[Crimmor]], and [[Murann]] prompted a huge emigration of Calishites to the region. Over a century after the founding of Athkatla, [[halfling]]s, forced from their homes in the [[Purple Hills]] by the Imperium, founded the nation of [[Meiritin]] in the {{YearlinkName|227}} in and around the [[Tejarn Hills]]. Another small nation, this one a theocracy named [[Minsorran]], was founded on the shores of [[Lake Weng]] in the {{YearlinkName|300}}.{{Valashar dates}} The city-state of [[Myth Lharast]] was then founded southeast of Minsorran in the {{YearlinkName|390}} after its founders decided that they'd had enough of the orthodoxy of the pantheists of that realm, and desired a "purer", monotheistic home dedicated solely to [[Sel√ªne]].

After the Imperium fell following its war with [[Tethyr]], the Emirate of Amin stood as a region full of small independent countries and city-states. Those still loyal to the Imperium migrated north and struggled amongst themselves and the already-established Shoonite garrisons in the region to try and carve out a new empire for themselves over the next decade. Despite the chaos resulting from the fall of the Imperium within its own borders, Calimshan still managed to exert enough control over the Emirate to maintain it as a center of Calishite commerce.

==Founding Time==
The Shoon Imperium only had one general at the time of it's fall who was native to the Emirate of Amin and not a Calishite. This general was named [[Esmel Torlath]]. His was the most successful campaign of all the former Shoonites to rule over the region. Though General Torlath only managed to exert his rule over the western half of the Emirate, this meant that he controlled the biggest, and most well-established cities in the region - Athkatla, Crimmor, and Murann Setting himself up as '''King Esmel I''', he named his kingdom Amn.

A noble family from Calimshan, looking to restore the Imperium to it's former glory, successfully took over the eastern Emirate of Amin, pushing out the majority of Meiritin's halflings and abusing those who remained. The rivalry between Amn and this eastern realm named [[Cortryn]] would last well over two centuries, resulting in the death of King Esmel's grandson and heir, as well as the complete dissolution of Meiritin. Otherwise, the next century was a period of great construction for Amn, seeing the establishment of [[Citadel Amnur]], [[Esmeltaran]], [[Keczulla]], and [[Purskul]].

The 7th century Dalereckoning saw the destruction of Minsorran, yet more conflicts with the ogres of the Small Teeth, and the expansion of Amn's borders. King [[Brinnaq I]] established Amn as a nation of powerful merchants and absorbed a lot of territory, including the purchase of a large swathe of Tethyr's northern lands. Unfortunately, after King Brinnaq died, his son-in-law [[Arbas Torlath|Arbas]] murdered every male relative of Brinnaq who was present in the nation at the time. Brinnaq's sixth son, [[Jhanos Torlath|Jhanos]], who was a [[wizard]], returned home and slew the usurper within twelve months. This began the rule of Amn's six Wizard-Kings.<ref> It was during the reign of Wizard-King [[Imnel III]] that Cortryn was destroyed, but it's destroyers, the [[Ring of Eyes]] - a [[beholder cult]] - prevented Amn from absorbing Cortryn's territories for the next twenty nine years until Amn finally took those lands as it's own in the {{YearlinkName|760}}.

It was during the reign of the last Wizard-King, [[Imnel IV]], that a financially-struggling and monster-beset Amn had to return the majority of the lands that it had previously bought from Tethyr back to their original owners. Amn did however, manage to maintain control of the trading post of [[Riatavin]], which had been built ninety years before and stood right on the border of the lands that the [[Imnel Concession]] ceded back to Tethyr. After Imnel IV's death four years later, Amn descended into strife as no less than three kings rose to and lost the throne over the course of [[1094 DR|1094]] and [[1095 DR]] due to the deadly machinations of [[Thieves' guild|thieves guilds]] and merchant families.

A new dynasty of monarchs, descended from a different branch of Imnel I's line were installed to bring stability back to Amn. The [[Wavegold]] dynasty's legacy was the construction of the [[Trade Way]] between Tethyr and [[Waterdeep]] via Amn, [[Baldur's Gate]], and [[Dragonspear Castle]] which was finished in the {{YearlinkName|1182}}. The last of the Wavegold kings, [[Belhinn II]], was killed in battle with the [[Black Horde]] in the {{YearlinkName|1237}}.

King Belhinn's son-in-law, [[Malek Parhek]], founded Amn's third and final royal dynasty. Plagued by poor leadership, a trade war, and multiple assassinations sponsored by Amnian merchant families, the [[Parhek]] dynasty failed to last even four decades. For the ensuing fifty seven years after the last Parhek king died in [[1276 DR]] the merchants of Amn tried to install the scions of that dynasty as puppet kings, but none of them were successful. This culminated in the [[Great Amnian Trade War]] of [[1333 DR]], which resulted in the dissolution of Amn's monarchy and [[Thayze Selemchant]] establishing the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] (with himself at it's head).

==Modern Amn==
The first of the early challenges facing the new Council of Six was the [[Murann Spice War]] in the {{YearlinkName|1338}} between the bitter rival families of [[Ophal]] and [[Ulvax]], but the conflict was successfully suppressed. Worse came seven years later when the [[Coast Plague]] killed a full 20% of those living in Amn's greatest cities. Amn then sent troops to secure [[Greenfields]] during the [[First Dragonspear War]] and was successful in routing the enemy. A couple of years later, the disappearance of [[Waukeen]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]] shook the faith of the Amnian people, who had tended to revere the Merchant's Friend over other deities.<ref> A more difficult challenge arose with the discovery of [[Maztica]] and the establishment of the colony of [[New Amn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}.

While this did put a stop to the slayings, it brought to light a conspiracy over the next several months wherein the Council's [[Pommarch]], [[Wulver Xornnag]], was revealed to have broken the council's new law by organizing his own personal expedition, the wealth and prestige of which would allow him to install himself as governor of New Amn and destroy the Council. By [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, the Pommarch, [[Namarch]], and [[Meisarch]] had all killed each other in an event historians would refer to as the [[Council Schism]]. Before the surviving three Council members could pick replacements for those they had lost, they were approached by the Grandmaster of the [[Shadow Thieves]] who informed them that he knew exactly who they were, how to hurt them the most, and that it was his guild who had engineered the Council Schism. In exchange for a seat on the Council, he would keep those details a secret. They agreed, and [[Rhinnom Dannihyr]] was given the position of [[Iltarch]]. A few years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the [[Iron Crisis]] almost started a war between Amn and Baldur's Gate.<ref><ref><ref>

The colonization of Maztica enriched Amn with plundered gold, as well as all the trade goods from the new continent that flooded the nation. This influx of money caused economic strife. The price of a bushel of [[maize]] skyrocketed to fifty gold coins. The inflation was caused by more money in circulation than actual goods that the money was supposed to represent. This conclusion was confirmed by some sages who formulated the economic theory explaining the inflation.<ref>

In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, following the end of the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]] and [[Reclamation Wars]], Amn saw large numbers of Tethyrian exiles and expatriate Amnian families arriving in [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]] of that year. Two months later, the towns of Riatavin and [[Trailstone]] defected to Tethyr, to the surprise of all of Amn's intelligence assets. The two towns had not seen a share of any of the profits from Maztica and additionally claimed to have been suffering poor treatment socially. Diplomacy between Amn and Tethyr failed spectacularly over the following month, resulting in [[Zaranda Star|Queen Zaranda]] accepting Riatavin and Trailstone's petitions to become Tethyrian and additionally, demanding the lands north of Trailstone. In retaliation, Amn ceased all overland and sea trade with Tethyr.<ref> Some merchant families even demanded that Amn go to war with Riatavin after they bought out all of the trade caravans from the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and [[Vilhon Reach]]. Over the following month, the Council hired a 10,000-strong army of mercenaries to march there and Shadow Thief assassins made several failed attempts on Riatavin's leadership. However, while the mercenaries and Amnian army were marching, word reached them that several Amnian forts and towns had fallen to monstrous invaders under the command of an [[ogre mage]] named [[Sothillis]]. Thus began the [[Sothillisian War]]. Further complicating things was a government conspiracy launched between Iltarch Dannihyr, Pommarch [[Tyrda Q'Helvor|Q'Helvor]] and Lord [[Pehllus Tanislove]] of the [[Knights of the Shield]] to restore Amn's monarchy.<ref>

Immediately following the [[Trade Way Truce]] in [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, which marked the end of the Sothillisian War and recognition of Kingdom of [[Muranndin]], the [[Stinger War]] began, pitting the now-allied forces of both Amn and Muranndin against the [[tlincalli]]s of [[Oaxaptupa]].<ref>

When the [[Spellplague]] hit in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Amn lost all of it's Maztican colonies as Maztica was swapped with its [[Abeir]]an counterpart, [[Laerakond]]. The Council of Six reconstituted into a [[Council of Five (Amn)|Council of Five]], dropping the seat of the [[Dahaunarch]], which was the lowest seat, and purely a military role, to concentrate on mercantile affairs.

At the turn of the 15{{th}} century DR, Amn worked to undermine [[House Kendrick]], the rulers of the human realms of the Moonshae Isles. They actively courted and worked to subvert the realm of [[Westphal]] while stoking civil war across the isles,{{Cite dungeon/196/Backdrop: Moonshae Isles|12}} and in {{YearlinkName|1404}},{{AmnInSnowdown}} they annexed the island of [[Snowdown]] and rebuffed the Kendricks' efforts to dislodge them.{{Cite dragon/405/Heroes of the Moonshaes|5}} They retained ownership over the island, stripping it of its resources, through the end of the century.

Amn grew to be a much disliked nation, where everything could be bought. The truce between Amn and Muranndin soon fell apart as well.<ref> Throughout the Spellplague era, and even after the [[Second Sundering]], Amn remained a realm dominated by the five merchant houses whose lords sat on the Council of Five, but beyond trade, had very little influence on foreign nations due to disunity among the councillors.
