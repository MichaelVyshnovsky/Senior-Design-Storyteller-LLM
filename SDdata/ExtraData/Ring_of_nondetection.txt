A '''ring of nondetection''' made it impossible to detect the whereabouts of a person, i.e. via [[nondetection]], who wore the ring.

==Appearance==
Rings of nondetection were normally made of plain [[gold]]. Such rings could be found for sale in [[Ravens Bluff]]. 

==History==
[[Alusair Obarskyr]] wore a ring of nondetection for years, to avoid being found by the wizard [[Vangerdahast]].
