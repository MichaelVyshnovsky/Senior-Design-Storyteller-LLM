A '''miscellaneous manifestation''' was a minor manifestation of a [[deity]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|9}}

==Description==
Deities could show their powers through major manifestations and minor manifestations. A miscellaneous manifestation fell into the latter category.

As "miscellaneous" manifestation suggested, the term was a catch-all term for manifestations that did not fall in other categories. These smells, sounds, auras, and even [[possession]]s but also unique manifestations of a deity.

Miscellaneous manifestations were used by deities used to convey information, but due to their often-vague nature and reliance on interpretation, they were sometimes misunderstood.

==Mortals' Reaction==
When a follower received a unique miscellaneous manifestation, their standing among other followers of his or her faith might improve. In fact, there was a high chance for that.
