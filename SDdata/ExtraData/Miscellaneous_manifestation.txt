A miscellaneous manifestation was a minor manifestation of a deity.
Deities could show their powers through major manifestations and minor manifestations. A miscellaneous manifestation fell into the latter category.
As "miscellaneous" manifestation suggested, the term was a catch-all term for manifestations that did not fall in other categories. These smells, sounds, auras, and even possessions but also unique manifestations of a deity.
Miscellaneous manifestations were used by deities used to convey information, but due to their often-vague nature and reliance on interpretation, they were sometimes misunderstood.
When a follower received a unique miscellaneous manifestation, their standing among other followers of his or her faith might improve. In fact, there was a high chance for that.
