==History==
Sometime in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a Waterdhavian citizen came into the offices of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]], wishing for them to absolve him of a bet he had made at a gambling table to a [[spellcaster]] that he believed to be [[Khelben Arunsun]], despite popular consensus among Waterdhavians being that the [[Blackstaff]] was dead. The man claimed that the victor of the bet demanded he provide one of two impossible things by the next night: either an [[elemental]] of chocolate syrup or "a [[mermaid]] [[succubus]] who's [[human]] from the waist down." If he failed to provide either, the man would be [[polymorph]]ed into either a [[garden gnome|lawn gnome]] or a [[myconid]] fountain forced to hold a selection of vegetables. The exasperated magist on staff that day, [[Maerlus|Maerlus the Magnificent]], assured the man that the Watchful Order could provide him a short-term semblance of either in return for the appropriate fees.{{Cite dragon/425/Spin a Yarn: The Night Thelva Clovenaxe Flew|43}}
