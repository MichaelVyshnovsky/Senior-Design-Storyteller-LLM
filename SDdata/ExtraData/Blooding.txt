The Blooding was a drow coming-of-age ritual in which a maturing drow must hunt down and kill an intelligent or dangerous creature from the surface. Much of the time the ritual was fulfilled during a surface raid, the preferred target being surface elves, but captives may sometimes be placed in the Underdark for the purposes of slaughter.
