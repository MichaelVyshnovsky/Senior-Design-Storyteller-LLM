Waterdhavian guard patrols got involved when they spotted what they thought was a group of evil will-o-wisps in the blaze. They engaged the wisps but did not realize that the group also contained some similar-looking nyths, which explosively reproduced in fire. The Waterdhavians killed the wisps but two guards were lost when the nyths began to reproduce.\nThe nyths went on to inhabit the Rat Hills and, as the Retreat of the moon elves from Ardeep meant that the monster population in the abandoned realm was left unchecked, they infested the Ardeep Forest as well.\n* \n* \n* \nCategoryEvents in Waterdeep\nCategoryEvents on the Sword Coast North\nCategoryEvents in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryEvents in Faerûn\nCategoryEvents on Toril\nCategoryEvents\nkso5r5f02aeeh0a16qqqytcpgjoytue"
