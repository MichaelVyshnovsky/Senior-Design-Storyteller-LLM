Waterdhavian guard patrols got involved when they spotted what they thought was a group of evil [[will-o'-wisp]]s in the blaze. They engaged the wisps but did not realize that the group also contained some similar-looking [[Nyth (creature)|nyths]], which explosively reproduced in fire. The Waterdhavians killed the wisps but two guards were lost when the nyths began to reproduce.\n\nThe nyths went on to inhabit the [[Rat Hills]] and, as the [[Retreat]] of the [[Moon elf|moon elves]] from [[Ardeep]] meant that the monster population in the abandoned realm was left unchecked, they infested the [[Ardeep Forest]] as well.",
