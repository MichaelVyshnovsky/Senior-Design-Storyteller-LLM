        "mainbody": "The Weave was also linked to fate, and a rare few individuals could manipulate such connection to alter the future to their advantage. However, usually the Weave punished those who used \"her\" in such a way.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stir Not the World's Doom|6}}\n\nSome textbooks deliberately falsified the nature of the Weave, as an attempt to limit the knowledge associated with spellcasting. One book that correctly outlined the nature of the Weave was ''[[Magic of the Weave]]''.\n\nThe Weave did not exist on [[Abeir]], making casting magic in that world more difficult than in [[Toril]].\n\n[[Spellfire]] was the raw magical energy of the Weave. Some people had the rare talent for manipulate this underlying energy directly, producing many magical effects. [[Silver fire]] was a similar ability granted by Mystra only to the [[Chosen of Mystra]] that enabled its users to envelop themselves in silvery white flames that bestowed many potent magical powers.\n\n===Special Practitioners===\n[[Elves]] of the Realms were born with a natural and special bond to the Weave.",

            "Spellplague": "Because Mystra (and formerly [[Mystryl]]) was inextricably bound to the Weave (one cannot exist without the other),{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Spellplague: The Wailing Years}} With the death of Mystra, Shar was unable to maintain the Shadow Weave and it collapsed as well.  \n\nIn [[1479 DR]] it was revealed that Mystra foresaw her own fall and let it happen because the Weave was growing more and more unstable, and needed to be renewed as part of a cycle fated to repeat again and again.{{Cite digital book/Elminster Enraged/Kindle|458}} In [[1487 DR]] the Weave was almost repaired to its former state.\n\n{{sectstub}}"

        "Anomalies": {
            "Dead Magic Zones": "{{Main|Dead-magic zone}}\nDead magic zones were places where the Weave was no longer in existence. Both it and its boundaries could be detected in the same way a wild magic zone could, but from outside the zone. Unlike wild magic zones, most casters innately knew when they've stepped into a dead magic zone. A dead magic zone could only be fixed with a ''wish'' spell or silver fire.",
            "Everywhere but Evermeet": "{{Main|Evermeet}}\nWhen the [[elf|elves]] caused the [[First Sundering]], they did almost destroy everything, which the timely intervention of the Seldarine limited to the destruction of a continent. \n\nAlongside sundering the continent of [[Faerûn]], they ripped the Weave in an irrecoverable manner beyond its self-repairing capabilities with the parts in Evermeet being the only whole parts of it, turning it into the only normal Weave to exist, and thus causing no abnormalities to exist on that island. \n\nAccording to [[Corellon Larethian]], the elves robbed themselves of the ability to cast true [[elven high magic]] outside of Evermeet and people such as the Grand Master [[Laeroth Runemaster]] suspected in the 13th century DR, that their ancestors did indeed destroy the entire elven race's special connection to the Weave when they caused the disaster.",
            "Shadow Magic": "{{Main|Shadowshell}}\nCertain practitioners of [[shadow magic]] could create a form of \"dimensional twisting\" from [[shadowstuff]]. By creating a barrier in this manner, a shadow mage could prevent anyone from passing through a designated area, and cut off access to the Weave for anyone within.",
            "Wild Magic Zones": "{{main|Wild magic}}\nIn wild magic zones, a spell could backfire upon its caster, target the wrong location, be dramatically increased in power, or many other things. A wild magic zone and its parameters could be detected using a ''[[detect magic]]'' spell. A caster could temporarily fix a wild magic zone with any dispel or permanently fix it using a ''[[wish]]'' spell.\n\nCosmic disasters like the [[Time of Troubles]] caused the emergence of severe wild magic zones after the Weave was heavily damaged. After the Time of Troubles, most wild magic zone disappeared but some remained.\n\nAnother source of wild magic zones were the artificial distortions of the Weave called [[mythal]]s. events such as the [[Fall of Netheril]] or the Time of Troubles damaged them. The damage turned these corrupted mythals into - even by wild magic standards - unpredictable wild magic zones."
