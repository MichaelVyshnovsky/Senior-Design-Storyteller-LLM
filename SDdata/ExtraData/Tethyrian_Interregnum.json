        "Background": "In [[1333 DR]], a number of [[wizard]]s and their mercenary armies invaded Tethyr in an attempt to create a new nation, which they would call \"[[Mulsparkh]]\". Unknown to them, they were sponsored by [[Calimshan]]'s [[syl-pasha]] [[Rashid el Djenispool|Rashid yn Yusef el Djenispool]] and the King of Tethyr, Alemander IV. The two regents acted in concert with the goal of killing the king's brother, the [[paladin]]-prince [[Rythan]].\n\nUnbeknownst to either ruler, they were both doing the dirty work of the [[Twisted Rune]] who wanted revenge against Prince Rythan for killing the [[lich]] [[Jhaniloth Puiral]]. Successful in their scheme, syl-pasha Rashid and the Rune ceased their covert support of Mulsparkh, whose armies quickly deserted. Troops from [[Memnon]] annihilated any who remained and put an end to the short-lived realm.\n\nNow that his brother was dead, King Alemander could rule without any familial interference. He implemented draconian laws that soon inspired dissent in the citizenry. and the increasingly greedy crown prince [[Alemander V]] was taking advice from minor nobles that contradicted his fathers wishes, in a seemingly petty attempt of antagonization.\n\nSince at least [[1340 DR]], Rashid plotted with Tethyr's General [[Nashram Sharboneth]] to supplant King Alemander and deliver Tethyr into [[Calishite]] hands, as the lands existed during the years of the [[Shoon Imperium]]. They sought to incite riots against Tethyr's nobility and manipulate crown prince Alemander into starting a coup against the king, with the aim that the forces of Calimshan could cross the border and have its army act as \"peacekeepers\". Prince Alemander V was easily convinced and began setting up his coup for early in the summer of [[1347 DR]].\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = \n| text   = For daring to presume that you might control the Maid of Misrule or her servants, you and yours shall never see yourselves on Tethyr's throne either.

        "Death of the Royal Family": {
            "[[Ten Black Days of Eleint]]": "With no ruler, Tethyrians continued their riotous behavior, directed the nobles who the viewed as having mistreated them over the last 13 years. In [[1347 DR]], the [[Eleint 12|Eleint 12{{th}}]] through the [[Eleint 22|22{{nd}}]] was a [[tenday]] of pure chaos in Tethyr. Mobs of peasants roamed the countryside, hunting down and murdering nobles as well as anyone with a connection to them. When all was said and done, nearly 150 lesser and landed nobles had lost their lives, along with 500-plus extended family members and over 1700 commoners. \n\nAmong the few survivors was the honorable [[Valon Morkann|Duke Morkann]], whose duchy would secede during the king-less years and form the kingdom of [[Erlkazar]]."
        },
        "Interregnum years": "The fallout left by the Black Days heralded mass emigrations, disease, numerous monster attacks and, of course, near constant warring among the various factions that emerged to try and fill the power vacuum. Over the next twenty years nearly a thousand individuals attempted to claim parts, if not all of Tethyr, for themselves. Northern nobles, wealthy merchants, mercenaries and adventurers were allowed to purchase land and titles in exchange for defending them from more despotic would-be rulers and roaming bands of monsters.\n\nIn [[1356 DR]], any missing persons and mysterious deaths were often blamed on the [[fiend]]ish battles that centered around [[Dragonspear Castle]] in the [[Western Heartlands]]. \n\nThe near constant fighting was only interrupted by events that impacted all of [[Faer没n]] such as the [[Time of Troubles]]. During the Avatar Crisis, armies allegedly led by the [[Red Knight]] were very effective at putting down a growing monster horde in the [[Forest of Tethir]]. The invasion of the [[Tuigan Horde]] saw many mercenaries leave the nation to join the wealthier army of [[Cormyr]], providing a little peace for the peasantry of Tethyr. The discovery of [[Maztica]] caused most of the warring factions to put aside their conflicts and rush to build boats so that they could plunder the riches of the New World. None of these expeditions actually made it to [[New Amn]] however and all the effort and manpower put into them was wasted.\n\nGoodly adventuring companies and the elves of [[Forest of Tethir|Tethir]] played major roles in restoring a modicum of peace and justice to the land. The [[Company of Eight]] played the biggest role, it was they who successfully ended the siege on the Duke of Dusk's castle, they who stopped the evil [[Nivedann Illehhune|Duke Nivedann Illehhune]] and his son from claiming the crown of Tethyr. Others, such as the [[Knights of the Unicorn]], [[Lathander's Lanterns]], the [[Magis Mir]], the [[Treantborn]], [[Sune's Smile]] and the [[Knights Kuldar]] all strived to do what they could to solve the worst of Tethyr's problems. \n\nBy the [[1362 DR]], the purchase of titles and holdings was once again possible in the lands of Tethyr. However their protection could not be secured by any governing body, and individual landowners were responsible for the safety of their lands. By this time, life in cities such as [[Zazesspur]], [[Myratma]] and [[Saradush]] began to return to somewhat normalcy whereas [[Ithmong]] and the outlying settlements were still plagued by dissent and conflict. \n\nIn the [[Year of the Helm]], the [[Chaos Curse]] killed nearly all the scholars within the [[Edificant Library]] while the monastery itself was destroyed in a months-long siege by the forces of [[Talona]].\n\nIn [[1364 DR]], the mercenary [[Bunlap]] ran a logging operation in the eastern part of Forest of Tethir, during which his loggers enslaved and killed many elves. His crimes were stopped by the [[Harper]] agent [[Arilyn Moonblade]] of [[Evereska]],<ref group=\"note\">Although her name was not listed in [[Lands of Intrigue (boxed set)|Lands of Intrigue: Tethyr]], the description clearly describes Arilyn Moonblade. in an series of battles that came to be known as the [[Tethir Conflicts]]. These conflicts drew the attention and ire of the elves of [[Evermeet]], which had become the ''de facto'' authority for [[Faer没n]]ian elves during the [[Retreat]]. A stern letter from Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] of Evermeet effectively ended Tethyr's persecution of the elves of the [[Wealdath]].",
        "Aftermath": "The ''Interregnum'' lasted until the end of the [[Reclamation Wars]], a series of conflicts that culminated with the coronation of [[Zaranda Star]] as the Queen of Tethyr. She ushered in a new era of royal leadership within the realm, from the new capital city of [[Darromar]]. The [[Year of the Gauntlet]] would see some lasting peace come over Tethyr for the first time in over 20 years.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Unbeknownst to most, some of the events leading up to and during the Tethyrian Interregnum were heavily influenced by the [[Vellurith]], a game of manipulation played by [[beholder]]s across [[Toril]]. One of the goals of the Vellurith was toppling and then restoring a ruling human dynasty. The elder eye tyrant [[Xithallowthlan]] accomplished this by indirectly causing the fire that claimed the lives of King Alemander IV and his family, and then covertly aiding Zaranda Star on numerous occasions during the Reclamation Wars. Xithallowthlan received a magical boon from the [[Great Mother]] for his subtle actions, indicating her approval.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/The Vellurith, Part One}}",
