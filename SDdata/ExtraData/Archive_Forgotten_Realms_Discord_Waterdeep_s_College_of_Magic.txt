{{SC
| query      = So does Waterdeep have a college of magic?
| questioner = ninjaturtwig
| answer     = In the Deep, magic is taught by Watchful Order magists (or secretly and privately). Either way, tutoring is at a place of the tutor's choice. So, no formal college; want to learn arcane magic? Show up at the Watchful Order HQ and ask.
