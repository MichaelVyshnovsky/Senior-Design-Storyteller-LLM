On page 175 of the ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'', where this spell is defined, it says it is a ''[[war sphere]]'' spell. However, in the appendix on page 186, it is listed in the ''combat sphere'' instead. Since the war sphere is mainly concerned with BATTLESYSTEM&trade; campaigns and entire units of NPCs, it seems more likely that this spell belongs in the combat sphere.
Powerful spellcasters of such a sphere were able to cast:
* ''[[spiritual wrath]]''
* ''[[word of recall]]''
Divine spellcasters who had mastered this sphere could cast:
* ''[[holy word|holy/unholy word]]''
