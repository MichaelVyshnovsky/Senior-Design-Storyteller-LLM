"'''Polygot'''" was a term used for someone who worshiped an entire [[pantheon]] instead of having a [[patron deity]]. A polygot [[cleric]] could receive [[Divine magic|divine power]] from any of the deities in the entire pantheon.

Polygot religions were common in [[wildspace]] cultures and rare in groundling ones. Since not all deities of any given pantheon had a reach that extended beyond their [[crystal sphere]]s, a [[spelljamming]] cleric was more likely to find at least one of that pantheon's deities in a foreign sphere than to find one specific deity. As long as one of the deities in the pantheon had power in a new sphere, the cleric would still be able to receive and cast spells.

For example, the god [[Tyr]] was a member of both the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] and [[Norse pantheon]]s, and as such, he was able to grant spells to any visitor to [[Realmspace]] who was a polygot cleric of the Norse pantheon.

Polygot faiths were not limited to spelljammers, however. Even among common [[human]] folk of [[Faerûn]], it was easy to find examples of people who worshiped a wide variety of gods rather than focusing on one.

On the other hand, most ground-based clerics did not show much respect for the polygot faiths, because of the intra-pantheon politics involved. A polygot priest of the Faerûnian pantheon would not go over well in Faerûn. Did the priest support or reject the dogma of [[Bane]]? Was the priest a follower of [[law]] or of [[chaos]]?
