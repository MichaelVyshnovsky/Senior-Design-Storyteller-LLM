The celestial planes were generally associated with the good deities whereas the fiendish planes were generally associated with the evil ones. The celestial planes were\n# Arvandor\n# Brightwater\n# Dwarfhome\n# Dweomerheart\n# The Gates of the Moon\n# Golden Hills\n# Green Fields\n# The House of Knowledge\n# The House of the Triad\nAll of these planes were connected to the World Tree which could be used to travel directly between planes without having to pass through the Prime Material Plane, but this mode of travel was often dangerous."
