Novice manifesters were only able to transport themselves, and went off-course about one in five times. With more progress, they became more adept, being able to bring first two people with themselves, and ultimately eight at the peak of their psionic practice.\nThe earliest records also asserted that, when used at the moment when one was struck by a sphere of annihilation, this science allowed the manifester to destroy the sphere harmlessly and gain an additional powerâ€”if they survived.\nThe power could also be used to arrive in the astral plane bodily, and find ones way to alternate Prime Material planes that had color pools in the astral plane. As there was no projection, no silver cord was manifested, and the risks were commensurate.\nRecords post-dating the Time of Troubles referred to powers such as this as unable to access the ethereal plane.\n* Wild talents sometimes allowed people to employ this science.\n* A staff of the magi was said to use similar powers, per some early sources.\nThe illithid that attacked the Emerald Dragon in the  planned to escape with probability travel if things got too dicey for it.\nThe following creatures were able to use probability travel\n* Githzerai\n* Shedu\n* Yochlol\n* Opinicus\n* Phoenixes\n* Mind flayers and Alhoon\n* Nabassu had no psionic powers otherwise but were able to use the power somehow, in a form that also allowed them to bring companions (or victims).\nThe following unique entities were also known to be able to use it\n* Charon\n* Lolth\nCategoryPsychoportation powers\nbdz93lp27u9or2mpp2zmlkvof65clu8"
