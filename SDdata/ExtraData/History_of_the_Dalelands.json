        "Early History": "The early [[human]]s found within the [[Dalelands]] were known to be of [[Chondathan]] and [[Damaran]] descent, and settled in small hamlets and farmsteads around Cormanthor around {{Yearlink|-200}}.{{Cite dragon/188/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A set of special swords from the FORGOTTEN REALMS}} In contrast, the Great Forest was well defended by the renowned [[Elven]] empire of [[Cormanthyr]], and any significant forestry endeavors were hampered by the elves.\n\nNonetheless, a land wealthy in natural resources, with a burgeoning human population soon attracted more settlers of their kind. The Dalelands opened up to a swell of migrations from all over [[Faerûn]], but most notably the growing countries of Cormyr and Sembia. This new presence was judiciously considered by [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]]. To prevent what would surely be bloody war with a rapidly expanding new populace, he arranged for the elves and [[wizard]]s of the fledgling human society to come together in agreement.",
