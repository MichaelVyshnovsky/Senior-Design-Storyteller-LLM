The '''History of the Zhentarim''' dated back to its founding in the mid-13{{th}} century [[DR]], and a reformation shortly before the [[Second Sundering]].

==Background==
;[[1229 DR]]:
:[[Manshoon]] was born to the mighty warrior [[Harlshoon]], commander of the [[Zhentilar]] and First Lord of [[Zhentil Keep]]. He had a brother, [[Asmuth]].

;[[1258 DR]]:
:Three months after they sent their respective sons out on adventure throughout the Realms, Lord [[Calkontor]], father of [[Chess]], poisoned his political rival Harlshoon. While Calkontor was busy mocking the dying warrior, Lord Harlshoon managed to muster his strength enough to throw a chair at his fellow lord and stun him before knocking him out the window of the tower. Their seats on the [[Council of Lords (Zhentil Keep)|Zhentil Keep]] became vacant and were taken by [[Theilon Greencloak]] and the [[priest]] of [[Bane]], [[Ulsan Baneservant]], in a sense usurping them from the absent lord-princes.

:In their travels, Manshoon, Asmuth and Chess got into battle with three members of the [[Harpers]] while exploring an old tomb. The group escaped the fight after suffering ghastly injuries, Asmuth lost his sight and Manshoon a hand, which disintegrated when he reached for the [[magic]]al [[sword]] for which both groups were competing. 

:The three young men continued on until they came upon a company of sleeping adventurers. Despite their injuries, they overcame the group's night watchman and slew the remaining people in cold blood. Among their possessions, Manshoon discovered a magical [[wand]], which he would subsequently trade for a magical replacement of his hand, and an [[arcane]] [[spellbook]]. He kept the [[book|tome]] and began his studies of [[the Art]], amazed by the power had seen within the subterranean crypt. According to the Zhentarim he received his calling for magic from the gods themselves.

:The [[Masked Wizards of Ankhalus]] assaulted several [[Zhent]] outposts near [[Phlan]] and the newly-appointed Lord Ulsan led an army to meet them on the plains of [[Thar]].

;[[1259 DR]]:
:On their way back home to the [[Moonsea]], the three lord-princes learned of the deaths of their fathers while in the [[Dalelands]]. Livid that his father was killed, moreso that his rightful seat on the council was taken, Manshoon formulated a plot to retake his birthright. He easily convince Asmuth their fathers died due to the machinations of Lords Theilon and Ulsan in an attempt to usurp their titles, and arranged for his now-blinded brother to "accidentally" fall from a narrow bridge that spanned a rocky chasm. Official records said he was unable to prevent Asmuth's tragic death, which was the result of a plot enacted by Lords Ulsan and Theilon.

:The Zhentilar and the Masked Wizards fought on the plains of Thar in the cataclysmic [[Battle of the Masks]]. Wizards on both sides used magic they had long prepared, specifically for that battle, and nearly annihilated one another in a fury of fire and arcane power. The Wizards of Ankhalus even released a lightning-spewing beast that burst forth from black whirlwinds and tore through the Zhent lines. The leaders of both armies perished in battle, including Lord Theilon, and [[Citadel Ankhalus]] was left in ruin.

:Ulsan Baneservant, the newest Lord of the Council and head of Zhentil Keep's [[church of Bane]], was left as the sole true power within the city-state.

;[[1260 DR]]:
:Manshoon and Chess returned to Zhentil Keep and were almost immediately beset by assassins sent by Lord Ulsan. The burgeoning mage killed the assailants with a silent ''[[fireball]]'' that leveled the manse of [[Vyalshar|Lord Vyalshar]] and the adjacent [[Spitted Man Alehouse]]. [[Zhent]] records stated that Manshoon returned from his journey with proof that Lord Ulsan betrayed his former conspirator Theilon during the Battle of the Masks and refused to recognize Harlshoon's son as a rightful member of the Council of Lords.

;[[1261 DR]]:
:In a scheme thought up by Manshoon, Lord-Prince Chess feigned an alliance with Lord Ulsan, for what would have been Lord Theilon's seat on the Council of Lords, and arranged to draw his former friend out for a meeting where he could be assassinated by Ulsan's agents. Overconfident in the plan he arranged with his new "ally", Ulsan and his allies were overcome by Chess, Manshoon and his childhood friend, and power-hungry High Priest of Bane, [[Fzoul Chembryl]]. Manshoon "exposed" the treachery of Lord Ulsan and the secret ties he had to the nation of [[Cormyr]]. Ulsan Baneservant was publicly executed, Lord Manshoon claimed his rightful seat on the council. For the safety of the Zhent people, Manshoon formed the [[Zhentarim]].

==Early Years==
:Soon after the formation of the Zhentarim Manshoon invited the Fzoul Chembryl to a meeting in the [[Tower High]] within Zhentil Keep. Manshoon offered him a position within the network's inner circle, alongside his apprentice [[Sememmon]]. Fzoul's involvement would bring the backing of the Zhent faithful of Bane and allow the priest to quickly take over the position formerly held by Ulsan Baneservant, and allow him to strike at the 8{{th}} [[High Imperceptor of Bane|High Imperceptor]] of [[Mulmaster]], [[Szchulan Darkoon]]. After praying to the Black Lord, Fzoul accepted Manshoon's offer.

:Manshoon continued his arcane studies, using the Zhentarim to constantly scout the Realms for magical lore and [[artifact]]s. He furthered his skills of manipulation, playing Zhent wizards against one another, ensuring that he possessed the most arcane power within the organization.

;[[1263 DR]]:
:With the backing of the Zhentarim quickly came to lead the Banites of Zhentil Keep, and renamed the city's temple to the [[Black Altar]], an act of dissent to the Mulmaster temple, called the [[Black Lord's Altar]]. This was a symbol to all Banites that they should renounce the High Imperceptor and the orthodox branch of the church of Mulmaster, and keep their allegiance with Fzoul and Zhentil Keep.

;[[1265 DR]]:
:After Zhentarim scouts reported a floating hollow rock over [[Teshendale]], Manshoon personally set out to investigate the anomaly, as he suspected it may have have been a source of arcane power. Within the flying boulder Manshoon met [[Xantriph]], a particularly cunning [[beholder]]. The two felt a mutually beneficial relationship could be formed and Manshoon proclaimed the locale as the [[Temple in the Sky]]. When worshipers of Bane and Zhentilar came flocking to the site on their [[hippogriff]]s, Xantriph spoke to them as the "Voice of Bane", commanding that they follow Manshoon's bidding. Bane was particularly amused by this deception and allowed it to play out.

:The aerial temple became a holy site to the Banites and a meeting point for patrolling Zhentilar soldiers and a waypoint for spies who reported on activities and developments in Zhentil Keep and the greater Moonsea. In addition, the "Voice of Bane" encouraged his followers to confess their sins at the holy site. Much of this information was reported back to Manshoon, while some of it was kept to further the eye tyrant's own personal schemes. In the meetings between Xantriph and Manshoon, the "Voice of Bane" would often offer "recommendations" that furthered its own aims.

==Growth across the Realms==
;[[1270 DR]]:
:Word of the Zhentarim spread around Faerûn by means of the foes they had encountered. Hundreds of people across the Realms traveled to the city of Zhentil Keep to join the new organization. Historians and [[sage]]s of Faerûn marked this date as the founding of the Zhentarim.

;[[1276 DR]]:
:At the behest of Manshoon, Lords [[Halaster (Zhentil Keep)|Halaster]] and [[Taradril Aumraven|Aumraven]] gathered the rulers of the Moonsea together, including those from [[Hillsfar]], [[Phlan]], Mulmaster, [[Voonlar]], [[Melvaunt]], [[Thentia]], [[Sulasspryn]] and [[Yûlash]], for a meeting in the neutral town of [[Elmwood]]. The two lesser lords convinced the leaders of the north that it was in their collective interest to refortify the [[Citadel of the Raven]]. As a gesture of good faith, the Zhentilar who had recently withdrawn from the recently-liberated Yûlash would spearhead the operation and clear out the fortress in the [[Dragonspine Mountains]].

:The stronghold would serve as a bulwark against the orc and [[ogre]] hordes in the northern lands of [[Thar]] and [[the Ride]]. Every city-state would send a small contingent of their forces, so as not to be weakened, but Zhentil Keep ensured that their soldiers outnumbered those of their neighboring nations. They were diligent in their efforts to not appear as if they were dominating control within the Citadel. The Zhentarim rigged the election for the citadel's captain in favor of [[Galauntar Hawkhelm]] of Hillsfar, a longtime-dissenter to the actions of Zhentil Keep. This was done in an effort lessen suspicians about Zhentarim control over the new site of power in the Moonsea.

;[[1306 DR]]:
:The combined forces of Zhentil Keep, Melvaunt, Hillsfar, Phlan and [[Sembia]] banded together to stop the imperialistic Mulmaster during the battles of the [[Moonsea War]].

;[[1334 DR]]:
:First Lord of Zhentil Keep [[Iorltar]] died under suspicious circumstances and designated Manshoon as his replacement as the head of the Council of Lords. After his appointment, a number of Manshoon's political rivals experienced mysterious illnesses. The First Lord called for increased military powers in order to deal with the emerging treachery within the city and impending dangers from outside its walls.

;[[1355 DR]]:
:The Zhentarim enthralled the village of [[Snowmantle]], transforming it into a labor camp to support their logging efforts in the [[Border Forest]].

==Time of Troubles==
;[[1358 DR]]:
:After Bane and [[Myrkul]] attempted to steal the [[Tablets of Fate]] from [[Ao|Lord Ao]], the gods were struck down from the heavens and forced to walk Toril in their [[avatar]] forms. Bane arrived in the Black Altar, his dedicated temple in Zhentil Keep, in an event known to the keep's people as ''the Arrival''. After having his Zhent begin work on the creation of a new colossal body, made from [[arcane]] magic and black glass, he had the Banite priest Fzoul Chembryl and Manshoon's apprentice Sememmon work together, to their mutual displeasure, to assault the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] in [[Shadowdale]] so that he could could enter [[Morningdawn Hall]]. Although the avatar of the Dark God was destroyed, Bane would briefly possess his devoted follower Fzoul before inhabiting the gargantuan body built by his followers. 

:[[Eleasis 13]]: The colossal avatar of Bane was destroyed in an epic battle with [[Torm]] over the city of [[Tantras]].

:[[Eleint 16]]: [[Bhaal]] was slain by the mortal [[Cyric]] with the [[sword]] ''[[Godsbane]]'', which was an avatar of the god [[Mask]].<ref>

:These events, along with few other developments would cause great changes within the Zhentarim. [[Iyachtu Xvim]], the divine son of Bane, and the newly-ascended deity Cyric, who took on his divine portfolio, became the focus of worship for a great number of the members of the Zhentarim. The [[church of Cyric|Cyricist]] temple, called the [[Circle of Darkness]] was formed in Zhentil Keep. The spirit of Iyachtu, which was released from his avatar upon its destruction, was sealed beneath the Keep, full of anger that it was Cyric, not himself, who claimed his father's divine power. Many of Bane's followers converted to the worship of Cyric, though worship among the [[Risen Cult of Bane|orthodox-sect]] was still strong throughout the [[Moonshaes]] and Moonsea, particularly within the [[Dark Shrine]] of Zhentil Keep. A small group began to venerate Xvim, who they believed to be the Bane's true heir.

===First and Second [[Banedeath]]s===
;[[1361 DR]]:
:A huge column of flame shot down from a dark cloud hanging over the Moonsea and ignited the Black Altar. This was considered a divine sign from among the followers of Cyric.

:[[Ches]]: Iyachtu Xvim is freed from his prison beneath Zhentil Keep, and ascends as a [[lesser deity]].

A few days later, the ''Godson'' possessed Fzoul Chembryl and directed him to take control of the Moonsea in his name.
:[[Tarsakh]]: Along with the [[beholder]] [[Manxam]], with whom he formed a temporary alliance, Fzoul Chembryl uncovered the alliance between the [[High Imperceptor of Bane]] in [[Mulmaster]] and another beholder [[Orox]]. The forces of each side get into a battle, but neither side claimed victory nor suffered any losses.

:[[Eleint]]: A plague broke out within Zhentil Keep, likely brought on by the risen undead.

:[[Highharvestide]]: Fzoul Chembryl returned to the keep in secret and began to take control of the [[church of Iyachtu Xvim|church of Xvim]].

Sememmon, Ashemmi and their forces were held up for three days while they dealt with the invasion.

:[[Marpenoth 24]]: [[Khelben Arunsun|Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun]] discreetly met with Fzoul in the city of [[Voonlar]] and struck a tenuous alliance. Khelben informed Fzoul that Lord Orgauth had been supplanted by the [[pit fiend]] [[Abarax]], and Fzoul pledged not to expand the Zhentarim west of the [[Thunder Peaks]] for 10,000 days.
:[[Marpenoth 29]]: [[Nimbaud]] and Fzoul bound the [[pit fiend]] who was impersonating Orgauth, having promised the wizard they would soon inform Manshoon of their discovery. Instead, Fzoul and Abarax slew Nimbaud, established Orgauth/Abarax on the Council of Lords and appointed him as Lord of Zhentil Keep. Nimbaud was replaces by a [[baatzu]], to prevent from disturbing day-to-day operations within the keep.
:[[Uktar 18]]: Fzoul and his forces, aided by [[Desmonda]] and the beholder [[Manxam]], attack Mulmaster killing more than half of the city's Cyricists including the High Imperceptor of Cyric. The [[High Imperceptor of Bane]], the former head of the Mulmastran Orthodox church of Bane, was brought back to Zhentil Keep in chains, tortured and imprisoned beneath the [[Keep at the Heart of the Hand]].
:[[Uktar 20]]: Iyachtu Xvim possessed Fzoul Chembryl and left him with a vision and the task of converting all the remaining Cyricists to Xvimism.
:[[Nightal]]: Manshoon prepared to retake Zhentil Keep from the newly-ascended Lord Orgauth and restore Zhentarim control to the city.
:[[Nightal 7]]: By means of the ''[[stone walk]]'' spell, Fzoul Chembryl quickly traveled to [[Mintar]] in the [[Lake of Steam (region)|Lake of Steam]] and received much fanfare from the city's Banites, who saw him as the avatar of Bane.

;[[1370 DR]]:
:[[Hammer 8]]: Agents of Fzoul Chembryl delivered the ''[[scepter of the Sorcerer Kings]]'' to the dark priest, which they uncovered from ruins beneath the [[Gulthmere Forest]]. Unable to wield the [[artifact]], but protected from its effects by his possession by Iyachtu Xvim, he hid it within the subterranean [[Temple of Iyachtu Xvim (Zhentil Keep)|Xvimlar temple]] located beneath Zhentil Keep.
:[[Hammer 11]]-[[Hammer 20|20]]: Manshoon discovered that his beholder allies had been working with Fzoul. Rather than confronting his former ally, he sent spies to appraise him of the activities of Fzoul and High Blade Uoumdolphin.
