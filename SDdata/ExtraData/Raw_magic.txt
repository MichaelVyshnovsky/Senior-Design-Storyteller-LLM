'''Raw magic''' was the basic essence of [[magic]].

==Description==
It was described as the frozen stuff of creation or as the mute and mindless will of being. All kinds of energy and all kinds of matter everywhere in [[Toril]]—every stone, river, creature, and the very air—were suffused or infused with raw magic and its potential energy.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Incarnum}}

Raw magic was manifested in the form of the [[Weave]], but it was present even in [[dead-magic zone]]s where the Weave was absent.

==Usage==
Mortal beings were unable to directly use or shape raw magic—it was locked away in matter and almost inaccessible to them.

The Weave, thus, served as a barrier or gate between raw magic and the world, and as an interface between raw magic and a [[spellcaster]]'s will, allowing them to tap into the refined energy of raw magic and shielding them from its injurious effects, making magic relatively controlled and relatively safe. Thus, the majority of spellcasters used the Weave to cast spells.

==Varieties==
Nevertheless, raw magic came in various forms that could in some way be wielded by mortals:
* [[Spellfire]], and its lesser form [[Silver fire|silver fire]], was pure raw magic refined and controlled and was the raw energy of the Weave. A rare few people could wield spellfire. When used in battle, it was a radiant blue-white jet; when used to aid, it was a pure silver font.
* [[Mana]], also called "spell power", was a form of raw magic utilized by [[bloodforge]]s and mages of the [[Utter East]] to create [[basal golem|golem]]s and fuel their powers. It appeared as a golden light and was gathered through meditation.{{Cite document

* [[Incarnum]] was another form of raw magic, appearing as a misty and radiant blue energy. [[Meldshaper]]s used the Weave to craft incarnum into physical objects.The [http://web.archive.org/web/20150520003526/http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/frcc/20070808 Class Chronicles: Incarnum] article by [[Eytan Bernstein]] changes incarnum from the soul energy it is in ''[[Magic of Incarnum]]'' to raw magic. The article states "In the Realms, incarnum is raw magic", implying they are one and the same. However, for clarity, and because incarnum has limited applicability while the Realms' raw magic is more widely defined, this article treats incarnum as a distinct form of raw magic.
* Through the study of [[wild magic]] zones, wild mages learnt to tap into raw magic independent of location, but their spells always included elements of randomness.<ref><ref>
* All spellcasters on Toril who learned (or relearned) how to use magic after the [[Wailing Years]]{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Magic in the Forgotten Realms}} and until the full restoration of the Weave in [[1487 DR]], learned how to use raw magic to cast their spells.
* As there was no Weave on [[Abeir]], raw magic was the only way to use magic on that world. Only [[magic item]]s, or beings who could produce magic on their own (such as [[dragon]]s or [[sorcerer]]s) were able to easily tap into raw magic, however.<ref group="note">The ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide]]'' and other 4th-edition sources state that some individuals from Abeir have arcane practices like those of Toril, such as those of the [[Anarch of Shyr|Anarchs of Shyr]] or the magic used by the dragon overlords of [[Laerakond]] while on Abeir. As ''[[The Devil You Know]]'' specifies that there is no Weave on Abeir, we can assume the Abeiran spellcasters are able to use raw magic.
