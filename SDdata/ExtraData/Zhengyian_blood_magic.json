This contamination generally came about after a persons exposure to a Zhengyian relic, but it could also be inherited from a contaminated parent. It was akin to a form of sorcerer origin.\nAs of 1479 DR, Zhengyian blood mages were most common among the half-orcs of Palischuk. The Warlock Knight Mansard Kanaoth was a Zhengyian blood mage. \nCategoryMagic\nCategorySchools of magic\nCategoryBlood magic\n62j2wf04xuwves7qcizccczmp3e8yah"
