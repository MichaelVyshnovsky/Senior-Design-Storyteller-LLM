The '''Test''' was a ritual of passage [[drow]] [[mage]]s were subjected to.

==Society==
Drow who wanted to change the society under [[Lolth]] and her clergy were considered a danger, especially if they challenged the authority of the goddess and her [[cleric]]s. Drow mages were generally suspected of belonging to this group and were subjected to the Test.

Non-mages were also often subjected to this test if they reached a sufficient degree of strength. Priestesses could also be subjected to it but they could hope for an immediate reward in the form of promotion on passing.

==Procedure==
Drow mages who reached a certain level of power were abducted and then mind-probed while under a test of loyalty. Sometimes, the test was done by Lolth herself in the [[Demonweb Pits]] after the subject was transported to the [[abyss]]al layer.

===Results===
Mages could die from the Test before the result was known. Those who failed were turned into [[drider]]s.
