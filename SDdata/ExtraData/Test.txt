The Test was a ritual of passage drow mages were subjected to.
Drow who wanted to change the society under Lolth and her clergy were considered a danger, especially if they challenged the authority of the goddess and her clerics. Drow mages were generally suspected of belonging to this group and were subjected to the Test.
Non-mages were also often subjected to this test if they reached a sufficient degree of strength. Priestesses could also be subjected to it but they could hope for an immediate reward in the form of promotion on passing.
Drow mages who reached a certain level of power were abducted and then mind-probed while under a test of loyalty. Sometimes, the test was done by Lolth herself in the Demonweb Pits after the subject was transported to the abyssal layer.
Mages could die from the Test before the result was known. Those who failed were turned into driders.
