'''Gem magic''', also called '''gem-magic''' or '''gemstone magic''', was an application of [[magic]] involving the use of [[gemstone]]s. There were two broad types of gem magic: the first type involved attuning gemstones to store or affix [[spell]]s for subsequent use, and the second type involved tapping into the natural magical properties of different types of gemstones.

==Gem Attunement==
This form of gem magic was meant to affix a spell to a gemstone for later use. The gem could only be activated&mdash;and the spell released&mdash;based on some trigger specified by the creator at the time of the gem’s attunement. The trigger could be that the gem was touched, that a certain amount of time had passed since its attunement, or that a certain manner of creature was present or came near the gem. An attuned gem could detect and trigger based on a creature’s type, [[alignment]], race, or appearance, but generally could not detect the relative skillsets or strength of a creature. Regardless of the prespecified trigger, the crafter of the attuned gem could freely handle the stone or even cause the spell to release prematurely if so desired. 

These gems could also be attached to other items, in which case their triggering could cause the stored spell to affect or empower that item. When affixed to doors or other large objects, the gems could serve as [[trap]]s. When affixed to weapons or other pieces of equipment, the gems could provide instant enhancements to the item or protections to its wielder. A common application was to create a ''[[gem ward]]'' which provided emergency protective spells in response to a nearby enemy. Common ''wards'' were empowered with ''[[protection from evil]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[protection from arrows]]'', or ''[[stoneskin]]''.

A practitioner of this kind of gem magic generally had to be trained in both gemcutting and [[Arcane magic|arcane]] spellcasting. To attune a gem, the creator had to spend at least an hour casting the spell with all necessary [[material component]]s. More powerful spells required bigger and more valuable gems, with the weakest spells needing a stone with a value of at least 50 [[gold pieces]] while the most powerful spells could require a gem valued at 450 gold pieces. Alternatively, [[wizard]]s with the proper ability to modify their spells could produce a similar effect simply by casting the spell into a [[malacon]] gemstone, while [[cleric]]s could store ''healing'' spells in [[topaz]] gemstones to be released upon contact with an injury.

As a general rule, gems could only be attuned with arcane spells, 

===History===
This form of gem magic was practiced in ancient [[Netheril]], where so-called "gem masters" created attuned gems and would sometimes embed them as traps in tombs and the like.

By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the secrets of the creation of attuned gems had been lost. When such gems were recovered from ancient treasure vaults, they would often release their stored spells unexpectedly before crumbling to dust in treasure hunters’ hands.

In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the practice of attuning gems and creating ''gem wards'' had been rediscovered, and some gods were known to grant the power of gem attunement to their more free-spirited followers.

As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the [[deep gnome]]s practiced a similar form of magic in which they created ''[[spell gem]]s'' that could store a single spell and then release that spell at the command of the gem's wielder. These items were known to be used by the [[Stoneheart  Enclave]] of [[Blingdenstone]], and the means behind their creation was a closely guarded secret.

==Natural Gem Magic==
Many gems&mdash;whether [[Precious stones|precious]], [[Semi-precious stones|semi-precious]], or otherwise&mdash;were known to have potent magical abilities, either on their own or when used properly in the casting of spells or creation of magic items, [[potion]]s, etc. Furthermore, harnessing natural gem magic was known to be imprecise, and would often yield "flawed" results&mdash;in much the same ways that gemstones themselves could be flawed.

===History===
The ancient Netherese used [[chrysoberyl]] to make audio recordings of everything from warnings to instructions to motivational speeches. They also made use of [[azurite]] charms to protect themselves from burns in their kitchens (a practice that was also held by folk from [[Halruaa]], [[Myth Drannor]], and [[Calimshan]]).

Many folk across [[Faerûn]] were known to make use of innate gem magic. Folk from as far and wide as [[Waterdeep]], [[Sembia]], and [[Chessenta]] would wear [[tremair]] stones sown into their clothes, offering them protection from [[curse]]s. Calishite and Sembian furniture was sometimes trapped by inlaying [[boakhar]], which could shoot bursts of fire. In [[Rashemen]], the [[wychlaran]] used [[Laeral's tears]] to bolster the toughness of their [[Rashemaar berserkers|berserkers]], while their enemies, the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], experimented with [[thuparlial]] to try to empower their fire-based spells. In [[Impiltur]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, [[Pelathyon Hawkryn]] came to be known for wielding "moonstone magic" in which he substituted [[moonstone]] for most of his material components. 

Other gems were wrongly believed to have properties that they did not, such as [[amber]], and [[Tiger eye agate]].

A form of this gem magic was practiced in ancient [[Mulhorand]], where the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|god-kings]] were the first to create mighty [[gemstone golem]]s which leveraged the natural magics of [[Ruby golem|rubies]], [[Emerald golem|emeralds]], and [[Diamond golem|diamonds]] to imbue the constructs with potent abilities. However, the secrets of their creation were lost as the god-kings dwindled, and were only rediscovered in the 1360s DR by [[Zulkir]] [[Aznar Thrul]] of the Red Wizards, however his understanding of gem magic was incomplete, When he built an army of [[golem]]s to attack on Rashemen, they proved to be unpredictable and often required a dozen wizards to control. Ultimately, his whole army had broken away from his control by {{Yearlink|1372}}.
