The Vanquisher was also the leader of the Adjudicators, Tymanthers secret police. A Vanquisher governed for a period of ten years, after which a new Vanquisher was elected.\nThe Vanquisher was always a dragonborn who had been determined to be fit to rule by rising in the ranks of the Lance Defenders over a period of twenty years. Dragonborn who became the patriarchs or matriarchs of a clan lose their right to be elegible as the Vanquisher. The power of the Vanquisher was not absolute, however, as he or she served most of the time as a arbiter for the conclave of elders, made up by all the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Tymantheran clans.\nAlthough Thymari rarely chose to became spellcasters, the Vanquisher had a few dragonborn spellcasters under his or her direct command.\nVanquishers used piercings different to those of the clans of Thymari society. Theirs were square bits of gold under their eyes like teardrops.\nAround 1446 DR, it was necessary to chose an interim Vanquisher.\nIn the 1458-1468 DR decade, the position of Vanquisher was held by Ophinshtalajiir Shaushka, who won the elections over Verthisathurgiesh Pandjed thanks to her successful military campaigns against the ash giants.\nIn the 1468-1478 DR decade, the position was held by Churirajachi Versengethor. The military won great prominence during his period.\nKepeshkmolik Tarhun held the position of from 1478 DR until his death in 1486 DR.\nAs Tarhun was killed before its mandate ended, and the need of a new Vanquisher became urgent when Gilgeam began to led the Untherite forces against Tymanther, in 1487 DR Yrjixtilex Kallan was elected as the interim Vanquisher until the next official elections, that were expected to be held in Kythorn of 1488 DR.\nCategoryTitles\nCategoryVanquishers\nj5oov25z4kmswcdvpej4ntfu5e7damk"
