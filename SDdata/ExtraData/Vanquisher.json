The Vanquisher was also the leader of the [[Adjudicators]], Tymanther's secret police. A Vanquisher governed for a period of ten years, after which a new Vanquisher was elected.",
        "Background": "The Vanquisher was always a dragonborn who had been determined to be fit to rule by rising in the ranks of the [[Lance Defenders]] over a period of twenty years. Dragonborn who became the patriarchs or matriarchs of a clan lose their right to be elegible as the Vanquisher. The power of the Vanquisher was not absolute, however, as he or she served most of the time as a arbiter for the conclave of elders, made up by all the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Tymantheran [[Thymari#Clans|clans]].\n\nAlthough [[Thymari]] rarely chose to became [[spellcaster]]s, the Vanquisher had a few dragonborn spellcasters under his or her direct command.\n\nVanquishers used piercings different to those of the clans of Thymari society. Theirs were square bits of [[gold]] under their eyes like teardrops.",
        "History": "Around [[1446 DR]], it was necessary to chose an interim Vanquisher.\n\nIn the [[1458 DR|1458]]-[[1468 DR]] decade, the position of Vanquisher was held by [[Ophinshtalajiir Shaushka]], who won the elections over [[Verthisathurgiesh Pandjed]] thanks to her successful military campaigns against the [[ash giant]]s.\n\nIn the [[1468 DR|1468]]-[[1478 DR]] decade, the position was held by [[Churirajachi Versengethor]]. The military won great prominence during his period.\n\n[[Kepeshkmolik Tarhun]] held the position of from [[1478 DR]] until his death in 1486 DR.\n\nAs Tarhun was killed before its mandate ended, and the need of a new Vanquisher became urgent when [[Gilgeam]] began to led the [[Unther]]ite [[First Tymanther-Unther War|forces against Tymanther]], in [[1487 DR]] [[Yrjixtilex Kallan]] was elected as the interim Vanquisher until the next official elections, that were expected to be held in [[Calendar of Harptos|Kythorn]] of [[1488 DR]].",
