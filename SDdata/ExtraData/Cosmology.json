        "mainbody": "Cosmology''' was the study of the cosmos&mdash;the structure, organization and composition of all that existed. What most people would call the \"known universe\" was labeled the [[Prime Material Plane]]. It held the world of [[Toril]], the [[Selûne (moon)|moon]], the [[the sun|sun]], and extended out into space to the stars. ''How far'' out into space was a question of cosmology, and the answer might depend on which cosmological model was used to describe the Prime Material plane. But there were many other planes of existence, some very much like the Prime and some so alien that they almost defied description. Like other dimensions, these other planes might overlap, surround, or penetrate the Prime Material plane, or they might be connected by some mystic avenue, often requiring [[magic]] to explore. Together, all the various planes were usually referred to as the \"multiverse\"<ref name=DMG1e-57\"> and they were the focus of cosmologists as they tried to map, measure, and understand the planes and their relationship to life, to death, and to each other.",
        "Cosmological Models": "There have been numerous theories on the structure of the multiverse over the ages. The three major ones are as follows:\n* [[World Axis cosmology]]: The post-[[Spellplague]] model.\n* [[World Tree cosmology]]: The most commonly accepted pre-Spellplague Multiversal structure.\n* [[Great Wheel cosmology]]: A popular alternative to the World Tree theory.\n\nThese models are simply that—models. They were theoretical ideas to make sense of the strange reality of the multiverse by mortal sages.",
        "The Prime Material Plane": {
            "[[Abeiran Material Plane]]": "Although [[Abeir]] once existed in the same cosmology as Toril, [[Ao]] split it into a cosmological twin of the local multiverse at the time, with its own separate parallel and fundamental planes. Other than the fact that it existed and that it occasionally interacted with the Prime, little was known of it.",
            "[[Oerth Material Plane]]": "A distant world visited by [[Khelben Arunsun the Younger]], Oerth differed enormously from Toril, being a geocentric world around which its sun and planets rotated.",
            "[[Terran Material Plane]]": "A world called [[Earth]] was located there, of which little was known, but which was once visited by [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince]], wherein he met with a scholar there named [[Ed Greenwood|Ed of the Greenwood]].\n\nHowever, by the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], it was generally accepted that there was only one material plane (called the Prime Material plane), which contained the [[crystal sphere]]s of many different worlds separated by the [[phlogiston]]."
        },
        "Anomalous Planes": "Though most planes were described by one or more of the cosmological models, there were some exceptions that did not have a clear place in any known cosmology. These planes existed in unknown, nigh unreachable places and only a few well-informed scholars even knew of their existence. These planes might drift distantly in one of the fundamental planes or lie entirely outside of the World Axis or any of the other models. These planes often did not follow the same physical laws as did the other planes and were immensely inhospitable.\n\nThe known anomalous planes were as follows, though undoubtedly more existed:\n;[[Far Realm]]\n:The Far Realm was a distant and terrifying plane that lay \"outside\" of the rest of creation. This maddening realm was feared for its power to twist unfortunate visitors into gruesome monsters and it was from here that [[aberration]]s came."
