Their balloon ended up crashing near the caves of the Othrysian dodecahydra,{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|12}} which emerged from behind a huge outcropping of rock in an agitated mood. The adventurers were forced to slay the hydra in order to continue their quest to meet Cronus.\n\nWhen the Ravenians eventually returned back to their city on the [[Prime Material]], some of the [[knight]]ed members of the group received honors for having vanquished such a beast.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|22}}",
