Some druids could cast these spells without preparation by sacrificing a different spell to channel its energy into the summoning.\n\nEach spell summoned one or more natural creatures, including [[animal]]s, [[elemental]]s, [[fey]], and [[magical beasts]]. The caster was not able to summon a creature into an environment that could not support it (for example, water-breathing creatures could not be summoned outside of water). When used to summon elemental, [[chaotic]], [[lawful]], [[evil]], or [[good]] creatures, the spell itself adopted the same type as the creature.\n\nThe spells included:\n* [[Summon nature's ally I]]\n* [[Summon nature's ally II]]\n* [[Summon nature's ally III]]\n* [[Summon nature's ally IV]]\n* [[Summon nature's ally V]]\n* [[Summon nature's ally VI]]\n* [[Summon nature's ally VII]]\n* [[Summon nature's ally VIII]]\n* [[Summon nature's ally IX]]",
