Some druids could cast these spells without preparation by sacrificing a different spell to channel its energy into the summoning.\nEach spell summoned one or more natural creatures, including animals, elementals, fey, and magical beasts. The caster was not able to summon a creature into an environment that could not support it (for example, water-breathing creatures could not be summoned outside of water). When used to summon elemental, chaotic, lawful, evil, or good creatures, the spell itself adopted the same type as the creature.\nThe spells included\n* Summon natures ally I\n* Summon natures ally II\n* Summon natures ally III\n* Summon natures ally IV\n* Summon natures ally V\n* Summon natures ally VI\n* Summon natures ally VII\n* Summon natures ally VIII\n* Summon natures ally IX\n* Animal summoning\n* Conjure animals\no35yzmomnfb0fys9jz7fwmlw3vx34ph"
