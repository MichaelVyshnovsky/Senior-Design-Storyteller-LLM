        "mainbody": "'''Chosen of Lolth''' were, like other [[Chosen]], mortals who were favored or otherwise \"blessed\" by a god or goddess, in this case [[Lolth]]. There were two known types of Chosen of Lolth: '''''Zedriniset''''' and '''''Yor'thae'''''.",
        "''Zedriniset''": "The first and less notable was known as ''Zedriniset''. The ''Zedriniset'' became a favored vessel for the powers and wrath of the goddess. For a short time in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, Lolth made [[Liriel Baenre]] a ''Zedriniset'' and helped her in battle on [[Ruathym]] against the priestess [[Shakti Hunzrin]]. Being chaotic and cruel, the goddess did this against the will of Liriel.",
        "''Yor'thae''": "The other type of Chosen was known as ''Yor'thae'' ([[Drow language|High Drow]] for \"Chosen One\"; lit. ''yorn'' \"servant of the goddess\" + ''orthae'' \"sacred\"). In the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, at the end of the [[Silence of Lolth]], Lolth summoned three priestesses to her in the [[Demonweb Pits]] to compete for the title of ''Yor'thae'': [[Quenthel Baenre]], [[Danifae Yauntyrr]], and [[Halisstra Melarn]]. Danifae became the ''Yor'thae'', consumed and literally turned into the eighth spider manifestation of Lolth. Halisstra was turned into the [[Lady Penitent]], and Quenthel returned to [[Menzoberranzan]] as the Mistress of [[Arach-Tinilith]]."
