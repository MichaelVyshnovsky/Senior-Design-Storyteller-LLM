Several of the books were originally part of the loosely-connected Harpers series, but as the story of Arilyn Moonblade became more fleshed out and the books became more popular, they were joined together as their own series.\nThe final book of the series, to be called Reclamation, was cancelled. Reclamation planned to address who Princess Amnestrias child was, unravel the mystery of the moonblades, and to chronicle the royal matters of Evermeet.https//candlekeep.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=10898\n# Elfshadow (September 1991)\n# Elfsong (January 1994)\n# Silver Shadows (June 1996)\n# Thornhold (August 1998)\n# The Dream Spheres (May 1999)\n# Reclamation (planned for early 2008, but cancelled)\nCategoryNovel series\nCategoryWorks by Elaine Cunningham\n7jje2gmxk4f04hlslq1jx9vvlutmvyx"
