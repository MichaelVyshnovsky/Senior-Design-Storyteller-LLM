'''Gauntlet''' was a local title used in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was comparable to a baron or lord and different communities used it in different ways.

The village of [[Shining Falls (village)|Shining Falls]] was ruled by a gauntlet.

The city of [[Loudwater]], meanwhile, had two gauntlets: the Gauntlet of the Western Marches and the Gauntlet of the Eastern Marches. They were senior warriors responsible for the defense of the city from their respective halves of Loudwater's lands. In times of war, they might be joined by a third gauntlet. The gauntlets directly reported to the reigning High Lord of Loudwater. ''Circa'' 1372 DR, the two gauntlets were [[Harazos Thelbrimm]], Gauntlet of the Western Marches, and [[Jaida Zerezeal]], Gauntlet of the Eastern Marches.
