        "mainbody": "'''archwizard''' was an [[arcane]] [[spellcaster]] of extremely high power who successfully claimed a floating enclave.",
        "Requirements": "In order to become an archwizard during the times of [[Netheril]], the arcanist had to:\n* Create a ''[[mythallar]]''\n* Carve an enclave from a mountain\n* Construct a city on top of the enclave\n* Claim the enclave\n\nSome arcanists skipped the first steps and gained archwizard status by taking over the city of a floating enclave. Most arcanists, however, followed the course laid out by their peers, going through all four steps.",
        "History": "[[Ioulaum]] of [[Netheril]] invented the first [[mythallar]] in {{YearlinkConvert|845|NY}}. He achieved archwizard status when he created the first flying city in [[Faer√ªn]], [[Xinlenal]] in {{YearlinkConvert|866|NY}}. After Xinlenal was afloat, many arcanists of sufficient power strove to make their own floating enclave.\n\nIn {{YearlinkConvert|3163|NY}}, the great [[Karsus]] was born. 22 years later, he became the youngest archwizard ever known.",
        "Notable Archwizards": ":''For a list of archwizards, see [[:Category:Archwizards|here]].''\n* Ioulaum, the first archwizard.\n* Karsus, the youngest archwizard who would become known as \"The Archwizard\".\n* [[Buoyance]], an archwizard who killed many of his archwizard rivals."
