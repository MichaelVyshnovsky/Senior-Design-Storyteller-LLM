By 1479 DR, the noble Alibakkar family of Athkatla held control over the rank of Namarch within the council.\nThe Namarch was responsible for overseeing the imports of Amn, with a particular focus on the goods brought in from foreign lands such as those from the nations holdings in Maztica. They determined what kingdoms, city-states and independent nation-states could enjoy favored trading conditions, and thus lower tariffs, when dealing with Amn. Along with the Pommarch, they levied trade tariffs, domestic taxes, set trade lines and established currency exchange and interest rates within the Merchants Domain.\n* Erlranther Alibakkar (1333 DR – 1345 DR)\n* Curkon Gheldieg (1345 DR – 1362 DR)\n* Qar Jysstev (1362 DR - ?)\nCategoryTitles\nCategoryAmnian titles\nfw585fmsi14scfyzhnonz01ckgnnz8a"
