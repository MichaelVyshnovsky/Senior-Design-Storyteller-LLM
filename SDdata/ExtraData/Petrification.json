        "Description": {
            "Forms": "There were several forms of petrification, though most were from [[spell]]s or the supernatural abilities of creatures. However, some forms were also embodied in [[magic]]al items, or [[curse]]d [[scroll]]s. The influence of the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Minerals]] could also turn visitors to stone in a process called ''fossilization''.<ref><ref><ref>",
            "Protection": "",
            "Usage": "Apart from the obvious uses, such as disabling foes, petrification was used for other purposes. [[Beholder]]s of the [[Underdark]] were known to keep petrified statues of ambassadors of other races, either for artistic value or for later consumption.",
            "Reversal": "It was possible to reverse petrification, such as via the ''[[stone to flesh]]'' spell, or the complicated [[mandrake|mandrake root]] extract brewed by [[fensir]]. If parts of the statue had broken off, they could be joined together before the spell was cast. Otherwise, an adventurer may have come back with a missing limb, or find something else missing."

        "Notable Petrification Spells": "[[File:FleshToStone.png|thumb|width|300px|''A humanoid's flesh turning to stone via the ''flesh to stone'' spell.'']]\nThere were several spells that could petrify beings, such as ''[[faerie sword]]'', or ''[[prismatic spray]]''.\nThe most notable ones were:\n* ''[[Flesh to stone]]'', which turned a being of flesh into a mindless statue. Its reverse could turn a petrified creature back to their normal selves.<ref> It was invented by the [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]], [[Mavin]], in {{YearlinkConvert|3394|NY}}.\n\n* ''[[Statue]]'', which turned someone into a statue, though they could still hear, think, and see. It was invented by the great [[archwizard]], [[Quantoul]], in {{YearlinkConvert|1839|NY}}.\n\n* ''[[Cast in stone]]'', a rare and powerful spell that gave a [[druid]] a petrifying gaze. If the druid so chose, their gaze could reverse the effects of petrification.\n\n* ''[[Meld into stone]]'', which if used incorrectly, could cause petrification, i.e., if the spell expired before the caster exited the stone, their gear had a chance of turning into stone.",
        "Notable Petrifying Creatures": "Several creatures were notable for their ability to petrify others, such as [[stone spider]]s, [[gravecrawler]]s,<ref> [[dust wight]]s, and [[drakestone golem]]s.{{cite book/Draconomicon|164-165}} The most notable creatures with this ability in the Realms were:\n{{Quote|Just as a basilisk's eye can turn men to stone, their bones can petrify a man's fate.\n|[[Elusina]] the Grey<ref>\n}}\n* [[Basilisk]]s, which could petrify via a deadly gaze.

        "History": "In {{YearlinkConvert|1839|NY}}, Quantoul developed the first petrification spell, ''statue''. A millennium and a half later, Mavin developed the common and more-easily accessible spell, ''flesh to stone''.\n\nDuring the [[Karsus' Folly|Fall of Netheril]], [[Mystryl]] sacrificed herself and broke [[Karsus]]' link to the [[Weave]]. Karsus became petrified and fell from [[Eileanar|his floating enclave]], and plummeted to the ground. His stony corpse was seen as a dying god by some travellers, who erected the city of [[Karse]] around it.\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Ko Ho San]] of [[Kara-Tur]] learned about the terrorizing effects of a [[gorgon]]. Since then, he sought to turn petrified beings back to flesh, including those who had shattered whilst in the state of statues. Around this time, a {{SI|12|ft}} petrified [[myconid]] king was situated in the [[Oasis of the Stone King]], after he had faced a basilisk. [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] slew the basilisk, whilst his father [[Zaknafein]], under [[zin-carla]], slew the myconids. [[Ch'Chitl]]'s emissary, [[Ilserv]] of the Illithids, was petrified by the infamous beholder, [[Xanathar]].\n\nIn the [[Anauroch]] desert in [[1367 DR]], [[Ibn Al'Arif]] was quickly elevated to the sheikh of his people after his predecessor was petrified.\n\n{{Quote\n|At a tender 16 years, Ibn Al'Arif became sheikh of this powerful people when his father was turned to stone by the fearsome gaze of a basilisk.
