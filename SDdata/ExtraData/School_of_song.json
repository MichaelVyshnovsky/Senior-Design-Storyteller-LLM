It was considered a [[school of thaumaturgy]], a system of grouping spells not by the philosophies of the traditional [[schools of magic]], but by the method that was used to access magical energy.\n\nThe school of song was in opposition to the schools of [[necromancy]], [[divination]], and [[invocation/evocation]].\n\nSpecialists in the school of song were called [[spellsinger]]s or song mages.",
