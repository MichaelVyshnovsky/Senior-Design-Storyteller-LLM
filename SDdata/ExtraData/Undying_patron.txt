An '''undying patron''' was one possible sponsor for a [[warlock]]. If a bargain was made between a warlock and a mortal being who had conquered death in some fashion, the warlock's patron gave them access to certain powers, including a suite of [[spell]]s that expanded their choices of available spells.
