}}'''Dunwood''', known as '''The Rawlinswood''' prior to [[1479 DR]], was a large forest in the north of the [[Great Dale]] that also encroached on south-eastern [[Damara]].

==Geography==
[[Merchant's Run]] passed along the forest's western edge. [[Impiltur]] lay to its southwest, while Damara, the [[Giantspire Mountains]], and [[Narfell]] were to the north. The [[Cold Road]] and [[Firward Mountains]] were to its east, the [[Great Road]] and [[Easting Reach]] to its south.

The [[River Lench]] flowed west from the Rawlinswood into the [[Great Imphras River]]. The [[Rawlin River]] and the [[Forest Blood River]] flowed south through the Rawlinswood from the Giantspire Mountains to the Easting Reach.

The Rawlinswood was larger than the [[Forest of Lethyr]] and together they covered 70,000 square miles. Winters were bitterly cold, while summers were cool with abundant [[mosquito]]s when the permafrost thawed.
===Flora & Fauna===
The woods were dense with [[fir]]s, [[oak]]s, and [[pine]]s thinning to taiga and muskeg in the north.

A diverse assortment of forest creatures, magical beasts, the undead, and demons including [[Green abishai]], [[banedead]], [[baneguard]]s, [[barghest|greater barghests]], [[bheur]]s, [[blightspawned]], [[darkenbeast]]s, [[dire bear]]s, [[dire rat]]s, [[dire tiger]]s, adult [[white dragon]]s, young adult [[green dragon]]s, [[fell troll]]s, [[giant stag beetle]]s, [[gray render]]s, [[hell hound]]s, [[Hellcat]]s, [[juju zombie]]s, [[mur-zhagul]]s, [[myrlochar]]s, [[night hag]]s, [[night hunter]]s, [[phase spider]]s, [[shadow]]s, [[sinister]]s, [[spectre]]s, [[troll]]s, [[black unicorn]]s, [[uthraki]], [[vampire]]s, [[werebat]]s, [[werebear]]s, [[wereboar]]s, [[werewolf|werewolves]], [[wight]]s, [[winter wolf|winter wolves]], [[wolf|wolves]], [[worg]]s, and [[wraith]]s all could be encountered there.
===Notable Locations===
* [[Denderdale]] was north of the forest's narrowest point and travelers sometimes used the area as a shortcut.
* [[Tellerth]] was on the forest's northwestern edge in Damara.
* [[Dun-Tharos]] was in the central portion of the forest.
* [[Clymph Tower]] and [[Tower Threespires]] were a pair of towers in the eastern forest linked by ''[[portal]]s''.
* [[Nighthawk Tower]] was at the edge of the forest near its eastern end.
* [[Zantmere]] was a short-lived meltwater lake in the eastern Rawlinswood circa [[1372 DR]]{{cite web

==History==
===Settlement by Elves===
Clan [[Sethomiir]] [[dark elf|dark elves]] constructed [[Narathmault]] in [[-10400 DR]] beneath what would become Dun-Tharos.
[[sun elf|Sun elves]] and [[moon elf|moon elves]] from [[Shantel Othreier]] settled the forest as part of [[Lethyr]] in [[-9750 DR]].
===The Rise and Fall of Narfell===
In [[-1020 DR]], raids by the [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nars]] caused the [[elf|elves]] of Lethyr to abandon the portion of the [[Riildath]] that became the Rawlinswood and an arm of the [[Great Glacier]] began separating it from the Forest of Lethyr.
In [[-970 DR]], the [[Nentyarch]] built Dun-Tharos near the [[Soleine River]] headwaters and began uniting the Nar kingdoms.
The [[Great Conflagration (event)|Great Conflagration]] between Narfell and [[Raumathar]] took place in the area from [[-160 DR]] to [[-150 DR]].
The [[Great Druid]] of [[Circle of Leth|Leth]], claiming the title Nentyarch, raised a living tree-fortress over Dun-Tharos in [[722 DR]].
===Conflicts with Impiltur===
In [[726 DR]], demons of the [[Scaled Horde]] from the western Rawlinswood and Forest of Lethyr overran Impiltur.
Impiltur slew and dispersed the western Rawlinswood's demon survivors of the [[Fiend Wars of Impiltur|Fiend Wars]] and the [[Battle of Moaning Gorge]] in the [[Scouring]] in [[850 DR]], driving the remainder to Narfell.
[[Soneillon]] took refuge in abandoned [[gnome]] mining tunnels beneath the Rawlinswood circa [[940 DR]] and began recruiting [[hobgoblin]]s in the Giantspire Mountains who used the tunnels to attack Impiltur in [[1095 DR]].

==Rumors & Legends==
* Sentient [[tree]]s from a past age took up residence in the Rawlinswood and the Forest of Lethyr in response to deforestation elsewhere.
* Legend in the Great Dale suggested a [[dragon]] cleared the valley between the Rawlinswood and Forest of Lethyr with fire.

==Inhabitants==
* The forest was known to be haunted by [[demons]] who dwelt in the ruins of Dun-Tharos. The defeat of the Rotting Man released demons into the Dunwood that the Empire of Narfell had bound underground.
* The [[Dag Nost]] tribe of Nars inhabited the northern edge of the forest in Narfell. The [[Qu'encesta]] tribe sometimes ranged that far south as well.
* [[Centaur]]s led by the [[Prancer]] inhabited the forest's northwestern edge. They were known to tolerate a group of [[druid]]s who worshiped [[Silvanus]] in the northwestern forest outside Tellerth. The druids prevented the inhabitants of Tellerth from encroaching on the forest.
* A tribe of [[wild elf|green elves]] lived in the Rawlinswood and cooperated with the Nentyarch, though they enjoyed spreading rumors about him.<ref name=DrMag222-p44>{{Cite dragon/222/Roaming the Realms: The Green Elves of Faerûn|44}}
* [[Volodni]] pine folk, native to the Forest of Lethyr, also lived in the Rawlinswood, though they rarely interacted with the surrounding communities.
* Small bands of individuals descended from [[fiend]]s could be found in the Dunwood.
* In relation to the [[Rotting Man|Rotting Man's]] activities, [[Talontar blightlord]]s, blightspawned, druids of the Circle of Leth, [[Witches of Rashemen]], and [[human]] and volodni [[ranger]]s all were active in the area.
===Notable Individuals===
* [[Lothchas]] operated out of the forest in Impiltur.
* Princess [[Rheárma Talltree]] led the Rawlinswood green elves.<ref name=DrMag222-p44 />
* The Nentyarch lived at Dun-Tharos in the central forest until being driven to [[Yeshelmaar]] by the Rotting Man in [[1371 DR]].
* The Rotting Man appeared in the Rawlinswood in [[1362 DR]] and was subsequently driven out by a [[glorious servitor|servitor]] of [[Lurue]] in [[1373 DR]].
* [[Hensoi]] lived at Nighthawk Tower.
