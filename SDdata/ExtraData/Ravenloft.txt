'''Ravenloft''' was a campaign setting released by [[TSR, Inc.]] It was a Gothic horror setting that took place in an extradimensional space known as the [[Demiplane of Dread]].

Ravenloft was linked to the [[Forgotten Realms]] by way of the [[Ethereal Plane]], and several crossovers between the two settings have officially been noted. [[Harkon Lukas]], one of the Darklords of the Demiplane of Dread was born in [[Cormyr]]. [[Gondegal]], the Lost King, was transported there, as was [[Jander Sunstar]], a [[gold elf]] from [[Evermeet]], and the entire [[Castle Spulzeer]], along with [[Chardath]] and [[Kartak Spellseer]]. In addition, there was said to be a gate to Ravenloft in the [[Glorming Pass]], the [[Greycloak Hills]], and an unnamed island south of [[Wa]].

At an unspecified time, a [[Vistani]] camp was settled near [[Daggerford]] and Duchess [[Morwen Daggerford]] asked a group of adventurers to scare them away. The Vistani were in fact trying to lure the adventurers into the realm of [[Barovia]] in order to rid the land of the vampire [[Strahd von Zarovich]].
