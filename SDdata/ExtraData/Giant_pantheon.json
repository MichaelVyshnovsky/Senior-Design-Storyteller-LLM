        "mainbody": "'''giant pantheon''' (or '''Ordning''' when used with an initial capital) was the group of [[deities]] worshiped by [[giant]]s and [[giant-kin]]. While some referred to these deities as titans, they were not descendants of [[Lanaxis]], progenitor of the [[titan]] race, and were primarily the divine children of Annam born by his consort(s), mostly before his marriage to Othea.<ref> They primarily dwelt in [[Jotunheim]] prior to the [[Spellplague]],<ref> with some maintaining realms in the Elemental Chaos afterwards.",

            "Stormazîn": "{{Main|stormazîn}}\nThe stormazîn was the Great Priest of Annam and represented the peak of the religious hierarchy. The stormazîn was always a male priest of great power and held the title for life. They were required to tend Annam's grand temple in the [[Ice Spires]] but also regularly traveled to attend various ceremonies and to sort out disputes between clergy members. The position was highly respected in giant society, but they held no official sway over non-religious matters despite their opinion being valued on the rare occasion they gave it."
        },
        "Worship": "Giants held no common view of their gods. Religious beliefs differed between giants of different races and tribes, even if they worshiped the same god, to the point that internecine squabbles could be equally as violent as those between worshipers of different gods. Festivals and practices of each tribe were based in general beliefs held by all giants, but the details were unique to the priest presiding over it.'' ''It was rare for a tribe to have more than two priests at a time.\n\nWhile the specifics of worship and religious views vary, all giants recognize [[Annam All-Father]], the father of the giant races, as the supreme deity. Giants acknowledged and revered the entire pantheon, but most tribes restricted their actual worship to one or two patron gods. The worship of any legitimate giant deity was acceptable in the temple of another giant deity.\n\nAnother foundational tenet of giant religious creed was that the taller the giant, the closer they were to the throne of Annam, and therefore ranked higher in the ordning. This was in part why [[Hartkiller]]'s was not widely accepted by the giants as an acceptable giant king, but was by no means a strict factor in ranking, since a cloud giant known as [[Xephras]] who was of notably small stature served as stormazîn in [[1366 DR]]. {{Giantcraft date}}\n\nGiants believed that if they died in battle, the servants of Annam known as [[Muspel]] and [[Muznir]] would carry their spirits to [[Jotunheim]] to fight for the Ordning and pursue whatever they considered to be the highest virtue for eternity. Giant priests also believed that shortly before the death of particularly pious clergymen that priest would be invited to dine with the Ordning in [[Gudheim]], the home of Annam All-Father himself.",
        "Deities": "The primary gods of the Ordning were:\n*[[Annam All-Father]], greater god of magic, fertility, learning, and philosophy and the chief deity of the giant pantheon, hailed as the creator of the giant races.\n*[[Othea]], a lesser demigoddess who was the wife of Annam All-Father and mother to the races of giants and giant-kin.\n*[[Stronmaus]], greater god of [[The sun|sun]], sky, weather, seas, and joy.
