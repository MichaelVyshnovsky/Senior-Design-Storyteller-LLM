{{Main|Lost Temple of the Fey Gods}}
{{Quote|''Faeries, sprites, nymphs, and dryads&mdash;the fey creatures of Faer√ªn's wild places are often dismissed as nuisances and pranksters. Those who truly understand the fey know that as with all things natural, there is a darker side to these creatures of fancy. Could a rash of stolen food and sleep dust traps point to a more sinister threat lurking on the wild side of reality? A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in Aglarond for characters levels 1&ndash;4.''}}
