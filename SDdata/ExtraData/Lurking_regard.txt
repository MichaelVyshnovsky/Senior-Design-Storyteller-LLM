The '''lurking regard''' was a theory supported by a few [[spellcaster]]s and scholars. According to this theory, some [[spell]]s were self-aware, with consciousness granted by unknown entities. This theory was used to "explain" why some spells sometimes seemed to either aid or thwart certain spellcasters or other creatures that used those spells.{{Cite dragon/427/The Sundering: To Rule Two Worlds|36}}

==Background==
According to [[Elminster Aumar]], this theory was based on truth, although it had been exaggerated. The "consciousnesses" that were classified as the "lurking regard" were in fact the same ones that existed within [[intelligent item]]s and the so-called [[living spell]]s.{{Cite dragon/427/The Sundering: To Rule Two Worlds|38}}

It was believed by some scholars that an individual named [[Estel Orvraunt]] was able to detect and talk to the "lurking regard" of some spells.{{Cite dragon/427/The Sundering: To Rule Two Worlds|37}}
