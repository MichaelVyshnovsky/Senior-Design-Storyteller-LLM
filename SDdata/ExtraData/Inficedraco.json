        "mainbody": "he Inficedraco was a genus of prehistoric proto-dragons.\nScholars from Candlekeep believed that inficedracos were an evolved and more intelligent species of the ignidraco genus. It was theorized that inficedraco had ferocious personalities and acted like solitary predators. Inficedracos continued to undergo a series of rapid evolution process until they eventually evolved into the true chromatic dragons species\nSupporters of the proto-dragon theory believed that chromatic dragons mentioned in historical documents written before that period of time, such as the Parwiccan Cycle and other similar documents, were in fact members of the inficedraco species."
