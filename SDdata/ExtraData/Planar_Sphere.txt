The '''Planar Sphere''' was created by the [[wizard]] [[Lavok Corthala]], putting many resources and much wealth into its creation. Near the time it was finished, it and Lavok disappeared for 500 years until it suddenly returned, re-appearing in the Slums District of [[Athkatla]], vaporizing whatever matter existed where it appeared.

A massive sphere, it was conceived and used as a vessel for [[planes|planar]] travel. The sphere had complex engines, powered by the heart of a mighty [[demon]] (a [[tanar'ri]]). Inside, there were several rooms, among them a laboratory that contained a machine able to create a [[golem]].

Several [[athasian halfling]]s occupied the sphere.
