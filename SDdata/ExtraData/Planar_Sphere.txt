The Planar Sphere was created by the wizard Lavok Corthala, putting many resources and much wealth into its creation. Near the time it was finished, it and Lavok disappeared for 500 years until it suddenly returned, re-appearing in the Slums District of Athkatla, vaporizing whatever matter existed where it appeared.
A massive sphere, it was conceived and used as a vessel for planar travel. The sphere had complex engines, powered by the heart of a mighty demon (a tanarri). Inside, there were several rooms, among them a laboratory that contained a machine able to create a golem.
Several athasian halflings occupied the sphere.
