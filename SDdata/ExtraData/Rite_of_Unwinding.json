In the second battle for Shadowdale between the [[Army of Darkhope]] and [[Shadowdale]]'s defenders, Sharran allies of the [[Zhentarim]] began the ritual and sealed the defenders' fate. Without full access to the Weave, the defenders were even more easily outmatched. Eventually, however, adventurers disrupted the ritual and [[Sylun√© Silverhand]] expended all of her energy to reverse the process, destroying herself as a result.<ref>",
