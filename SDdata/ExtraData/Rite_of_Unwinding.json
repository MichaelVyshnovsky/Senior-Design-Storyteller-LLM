In the second battle for Shadowdale between the Army of Darkhope and Shadowdales defenders, Sharran allies of the Zhentarim began the ritual and sealed the defenders fate. Without full access to the Weave, the defenders were even more easily outmatched. Eventually, however, adventurers disrupted the ritual and Sylun√© Silverhand expended all of her energy to reverse the process, destroying herself as a result.\nCategoryRituals\nso30m9i0bqvfptmrwf42yk9ohj0p3j6"
