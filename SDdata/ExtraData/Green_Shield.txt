In the [[Heralds of Faer√ªn]] organization, the office of '''Green Shield''' was one of two unique positions ([[Gauntlet (Herald)|Gauntlet]] being the other one) that were temporary. While most Herald offices were a lifetime appointment, Green Shield was given a four-year term that began and ended just before consecutive [[Shieldmeet]]s. Green Shield presided over the particular quadrennial festival at which was convened the [[Heralds' Round]]&mdash;an open court wherein the [[High Heralds]] publicly spoke and voted on various aspects of Herald business. Green Shield was responsible for the docket of the Round as well as most other aspects of the Shieldmeet: seeing the rituals were properly performed, the organization, logistics, and scheduling of events were carried out, security provided for the distinguished attendees, proper precedence observed, and all of it done with diplomacy.

This office was usually filled from the ranks of the [[Heralds Pursuivant]] and never by a sitting High Herald. New appointees were trained by, and generally took their direction from, [[Old Night]]. Good performance frequently resulted in the term of office being renewed for another four years. The residence of this office was a fortification known as [[Shield House]] located in northern [[Cormyr]], northeast of [[Castle Crag]] on the west side of the [[Immerflow]] tributary.

==Possessions==
Green Shield and Gauntlet were collectively known as the Tabards, short for the Sun and Moon Tabards, referring to the [[wikipedia:en:Tabard|heraldic overgarments]] they wore. The shield of the office was a forest green field with no division, devices, or ordinaries. The rod of office was a metal shaft that bore two miniature shields, one at each end. The rod could operate as a ''[[rod of splendor]]'' and a ''[[wand of negation]]''.

==Office Holders==
