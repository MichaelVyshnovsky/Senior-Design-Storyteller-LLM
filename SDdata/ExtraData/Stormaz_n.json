        "Selection": "A ''stormazîn'' was the Great Priest of Annam for life; a new ''stormazîn'' was elected by all of the giant tribes upon the death of the previous holder of the title. The ''stormazîn'' was always a male, and upon taking the title, he would advance to become the most powerful [[cleric]] of any giant.",
        "Duties": "The duties of the ''stormazîn'' included taking care of Annam's grand temple, located in the [[Ice Spires]] northeast of [[Hartsvale]]; training lesser priests, even those of [[Giant pantheon|the other giant deities]]; traveling to various giant steadings to perform ritual ceremonies; determining new religious laws; and acting as a judge when disputes arose amongst priests. The ''stormazîn's'' power was limited to the religious sphere, but he was respected by giants from all societies. Most [[Giant|''Jotunbrud'']] chieftains, no matter their race, would heed the ''stormazîn's'' advice. Traditionally, the ''stormazîn'' offered it only rarely.\n\nEvery two years, the ''stormazîn'' held a special ceremony to appoint new clergy. One a month, he led a prayer vigil to seek guidance from the All-Father.",
