Hills were also used.\nKhans were always buried with some of their most prized possessions since it was believed that they would use them in the afterlife. The favorite mount of a khan was slain and buried with him as well. On some occasions, valued servants were also slain and interred as well.\nA khan was buried sitting up with his possessions placed around him. The entire tomb was covered and remained unmarked to keep the location hidden. Curses were placed upon the tomb to dissuade robbers. Any slaves used to construct the tomb were slain upon its completion.\nCategoryLocations in Ejen Horo\nCategoryLocations in the Hordelands\nCategoryLocations in Northeast Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\ndprdd4yvzvkcwvh53l40xma7o23ff9a"
