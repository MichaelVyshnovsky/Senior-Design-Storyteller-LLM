        "Weaponology": "Siege engines were typically used in offenses against walled cities or fortified towns, castles, or other kinds of fortresses. Because of this they were rare to non-existent in areas of [[Toril]] that lacked such structures, such as [[Chult]].<ref> Beyond land, weaponry derived from siege engines were mounted on ships and used in naval combat.<ref><ref> And beyond Toril itself, many [[spelljammer]]s utilized weapons that were derived from siege engines.<ref>\n\nThose skilled in the building and maintenance of siege engines were known as siege [[engineering|engineers]].<ref> It was common for them to supervise the operation of siege engines. Soldiers primarily skilled in their operation were known by some as [[artillerist (profession)|artillerist]]s.<ref>",
        "Siege Engines in the Realms": {
            "Bombardment Engines": "[[File:SiegeEngines HoB.jpg|thumb|273px|''From left to right, clockwise: a ballista, a scorpion, a trebuchet, and a mangonel.'']]\n'''Bombardment engine''' was a term for any siege engine that was designed to hurl large missiles. Some had little to no accuracy, firing their projectiles indirectly high into the air, and thus had to be pointed in general directions rather than at specific targets.\n* [[Ballista]]: A stationary form of siege weapon that resembled an oversized [[crossbow]], They typically fired heavy, [[spear]]-like missiles, though could be made to fire round shots of metal or stone. Of the bombardment engines they were fairly accurate and had a trajectory that was relatively flat.\n* [[Bombard]]: A large pipe of wrought [[iron]] or [[bronze]] that shot large, but relatively light weight, stone balls They could also be found used on ships on [[Toril]], being one of the largest [[firearm|weapons]] on the planet to require [[smokepowder]] charges. However, they were quite rare, expensive, and dangerous to use.<ref> Even more rare were the ''[[Thayan bombard]]s'', a distinct [[magic]]al form of bombard that was developed by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]].\n* [[Catapult]]: A massive variety of siege engine, usually consisting of a lever made from a flexible material mounted on a sturdy frame. They were capable of hurling rocks and other heavy objects high into the air at long distances, deriving this power from tension. They could be further separated into heavy and light catapults, which were different in size and had different limits to what they could hurl.\n* [[Goblin hucker]]: A trebuchet-like device that was developed by [[hobgoblin]]s. Rather than a traditional platform, these were designed to be worn upon the back and shoulders of [[ogre]]s by means of an elaborate leather harness that took around 10 minutes to attach. Though designed specifically for use by ogres, they could theoretically be worn by any similarly large creature. Goblin huckers were also designed with the intent of hurling [[goblin]]s as missiles, typically adorned with a spiked [[helmet]], though they could just as easily launch similarly sized projectiles like rocks or flaming [[cask]]s of [[pitch]].<ref>\n[[File:Crossbow Great.png|thumb|250px|''The great crossbow of DaRoni.'']]\n* [[Great crossbow]]: A siege engine resembling a gigantic crossbow, far larger than a ballista, that was developed by the [[gnome]] inventor [[Nadul DaRoni]]. Originally developed for King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], copies of the invention were later sold within [[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|''Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue'']].<ref>\n* [[Hurler]]: A simple rock throwing siege engine developed by Nadul DaRoni that was far smaller in size than similar engines, like the catapult and mangonel.\n* [[Mangonel]]: Another torsion powered siege engine, related to and often confused with the catapult.\n* '''Scorpion:''' A [[bolt]] throwing siege engine similar to, but lighter than, ballistae.<ref> Scorpions were once used in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] by the forces of Baron [[Krelas Ugarak]] to defend the [[Molten Vault]].{{Cite adventurers league/The Iron Baron|9-10}}\n* [[Trebuchet]]: A massive variety of siege engine similar to catapults. They relied upon gravity and the potential energy of their heavy missile loads, a lever and counterpoise system, to fire from great distances.",
            "Crushing Engines": {
                "Battering ram": "A battering ram engine or \"suspended ram\" consisted of a heavy, sturdy pole that was supported by and suspended within a wheeled gallery, either by [[rope]]s or chains that were slung around the scaffolding's roof beams. This allowed its crew to swing the ram back and forth against objects with ease, requiring less energy than battering rams that weren't suspended in a frame. These poles were also often capped with a heavy, reinforced metal head.",
                "'''Bore'''": "also known as a '''sow''', was a siege engine designed for use against stonework. They were similar in design to a suspended battering ram, consisting of a wheeled gallery with a central mechanism (usually a log), capped with a large metal screw bit, that was suspended from its roof beams with slings. This manner of suspension allowed the mechanism to turn about its axis. It was operated by pulling back the mechanism and letting it swing into the target, much like a wheeled battering ram. Some bores instead had stakes of metal or wood driven into the mechanism along their length, which acted as handles for operators to manually rotate it against the target. The weight of bores varied from {{SIrange|100|600|lb|k}}."

            "Miscellaneous": "* '''Arcane''': a variety of magical siege engines in the 15{{th}} century DR that were used by [[Thay]], They were designed to hurl various type of arcane energy, such as [[fire]], force, and lightning.\n* '''Flame cannon:''' A siege engine that was designed to hurl casks of [[alchemist's fire]].<ref>\n* [[Greek fire projector]]: A metal tube that was designed to fire [[everburning oil]].\n* '''Siege tower:''' Massive mobile wooden towers. They were typically built as a beam frame standing {{SIrange|30|40|ft}} tall , with a ladder on its back or interior, with wheels or atop rollers. Some were built with drawbridges and a partially enclosed deck at their top. They were designed to be moved up against an enemy structure and allow troops to scale over while under the cover of the tower.\n\n==Notable Siege Engines<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Notable\">This section only encompasses instances in which the wording of the source material leaves the type of siege engine '''ambiguous''', rather than instances where the type is '''specified'''.
