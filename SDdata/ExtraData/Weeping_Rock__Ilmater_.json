The holy war had broken out around [[1265 DR]] when Archsufferer [[Bloirt Waelarn]] of the [[House of the Broken God]] in [[Keltar]] had denounced his fellow Ilmatari priests of the [[House of Holy Suffering]] in [[Mussum]] for refusing to relinquish the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', the holiest book of the faith. On one side were the Mussum priests and the [[Companions of the Noble Heart]] paladin order, and on the other were Waelarn, his followers, the [[Holy Warriors of Suffering]], and the [[Knights of the Bleeding Shield]].",

            "Notes": "* Another [[Weeping Rock]] appears in the [[Marching Mountains]] of [[Archendale]] in the [[Dalelands]]. However, it is located very far away from both Keltar and Mussum and the description does not suggest a battle took place there. Therefore, this article assumes that they are different locations.",
