{{Quote|Contrary to the barbarians of the northern lands, we of Calimshan take great pride in our families and clan. A person is worthless without the identity gained by his name and that of his family.|[[Pasha]] Amid yn Bhalar el Mjoal yi [[Manshaka]]<ref name=EotSS-p53>}}
Names and titles were a matter of pride and honor to a typical [[Calishite]]. This article describes the conventions and traditions of Calishite naming.

==General Format==
For a free individual, a Calishite would first list his or her titles, followed by given name, followed by his or her parent's name, followed by family name, followed by hometown.<ref name=EotSS-p54>

For a slave, the individual's given name was followed by the particle ''adh'' and his or her owner or owning family.<ref name=EotSS-p54/>

===Titles===
A Calishite noble often had many titles. Formally, all of them would be listed in order of importance with the least important title first.<ref name=EotSS-pp58-60>

If one was the highest rank of a given title, the prefix ''syl-'' was added to the title name.<ref name=EotSS-pp58-60/>

===Patronym/Matronym===
Male Calishite names indicated the father with the particle ''yn'', meaning "son of", followed by the father's given name. Female Calishites used the word ''yr'', "daughter of", followed by their mother's name. Occasionally, a man might refer to himself as the son of his mother, or a woman as the daughter of her father, if the parent was particularly famous or if the other parent was particularly infamous.<ref name=EotSS-p54/>

As a sign of true respect, one might additionally include the names of grandparents when addressing another.<ref name=EotSS-pp58-60/>

===Surnames===
A Calishite individual's family or clan name followed the patronym/matronym, prefixed with the article ''el'' or less commonly ''al''.<ref name=EotSS-p54/><ref group=note>If there was a subtle distinction between the meanings of the articles ''el'' and ''al'', it is not at all clear from any of the sourcebooks.

A woman would take the family name of her husband when marrying, but she would maintain a link to her family of origin through her matronym (mother's name).<ref group=note>This is not directly stated in any source but is clear from all examples given.

Religious devotees often replaced their family name with the name of their god, going by the surname ''el [[Ilmater]]'' for example. This was not considered disrespectful to their family but was seen as a sign of respect to their patron deity.<ref name=EotSS-p54/>

===Hometown===
Sometimes, a Calishite would proudly indicate his or her place of birth or residence with the preposition ''yi'', meaning "from", followed by the name of the town or city. If a person had rejected his or her family or been disowned, this would commonly substitute for the surname.<ref name=EotSS-p54/>

==Examples==
; Oma yr Asfora el Tenassar yi Almraiven: Oma daughter of Asfora of the Tenassar family from [[Almraiven]]
; Pasha of Gemcutters, Druzir of Emerald Drudach Bollus yn Kalil el Erispar : Guildmaster of Gemcutters, Leader of Emerald Precinct Bollus son of Kalil of House Erispar
; Kwalu adh Erispar : Kwalu, slave of House Erispar
; Buttercup adh Oma : Buttercup, personal maid for Oma el Tenassar
; Brother Faruk el Anachtyr : Brother Faruk, priest of [[Tyr|Anachtyr]]

==Exceptions==
Due to the influence of other cultures, some Calishites dropped the article ''el'' or ''al'' in their surnames.<ref name=EotSS-p54/> For example, the sultan of [[Keltar]], [[Duncan el Ashnarti]], often went by "Duncan Ashnarti".<ref name=EotS-p56><ref name=EotSS-p108>

In other cases, if one wished to hide his or her background or did not know it, the usual naming traditions were abandoned. This was often the case among the many [[rogue]]s of [[Calimshan]].<ref name=EotSS-p54/>

==Address==
To formally address a Calishite, one used as complete a name as possible. If one had many titles, the ''[[annuv]]'', a hand motion in speech or a marking in writing, could be used for the sake of brevity to indicate that not all titles had been spoken or written.<ref name=EotSS-pp58-60/>

If the status and name of the person were unknown, the terms ''tabarif'' and ''tabarifa'' were used for males and females respectively, which translated as "honorable stranger". When addressing those of higher status, the terms were ''rafayam'' and ''rafayar''.<ref name=EotSS-pp58-60/>
