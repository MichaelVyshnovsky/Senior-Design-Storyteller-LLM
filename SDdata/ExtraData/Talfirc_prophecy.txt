The Talfirc prophecy was an ancient prophecy of the Talfirc people.
According to the witch Isela, in ancient times, there was an oracle who was the leader of a Talfirc tribe. The oracle went to a certain location and said that a child marked with magic would save the Talfirc. The child would go on a quest to defeat a darkness like no other. However, someone had to help the child when he came, and thus the Talfirc built the city of Talis on the spot and waited for the child to come.
But the child never came and the Talfirc disappeared, Talis was ruined, and the prophecy forgotten by all but the the witch Isela, who dwelled there in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Then, in the , the reformed Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon, accompanied by Cormik and Jewel Talondim arrived in Talis after they escaped the hands of the shadevar. Kellen Caldorien was the child wizard of the prophecy, and his father, Caledan Caldorien, was becoming the next Shadowking, the darkness that the child must defeat.
