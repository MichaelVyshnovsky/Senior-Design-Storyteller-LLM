The Celestial Hebdomad was the name given to the seven celestial paragons that ruled Mount Celestia and the celestial archons that lived there. These archon paragons were also called tome archons.
The Hebdomad were subservient to the deities of the Triad and Helm.
In the late 14 century DR,
* Barachiel the Messenger ruler of Lunia and coordinator of Mount Celestias defenses should it ever be attacked.
* Domiel the Mercy-bringer ruler of Mercuria.
* Erathaol the Seer ruler of Venya and patron of seers and prophets.
* Pistis Sophia the Ascetic ruler of Solania.
* Raziel the Crusader ruler of Mertion and patron of paladins.
* Sealtiel the Defender ruler of Jovar and charged with protecting Chronias.
* Zaphkiel the Watcher ruler of Chronias and the Celestial Hebdomad.
In the early days of creation, seven martyrs who died for the cause of law and goodness appeared on Mount Celestia as the first tome archons. They became Mount Celestias rulers, leaders of the armies of righteousness.
Only Zaphkiel remained of the original seven martyrs the other six had long since been killed and replaced. When one tome archon died, another archon was promoted, instantly taking on the form and powers of their predecessor.
