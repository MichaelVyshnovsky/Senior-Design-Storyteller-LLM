Dew-worms, also known as whiteworms, were a large species of earthworm found in the Realms.
These creatures were similar in size to bookworms and rot grubs.
Particularly large dew-worms could be found in Tashalar. 
Dew-worms preserved in rose-wine jelly was a regional delicacy of Tashalar, though many found this tradition to be disgusting. And the Copper Coronet, a tavern in Athkatla, often had dew-worms in its stews.
