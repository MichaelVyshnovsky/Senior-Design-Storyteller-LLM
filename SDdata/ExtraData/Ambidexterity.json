        "mainbody": "Ambidexterity was the mundane ability or trait to proficiently use both hands in any given task, having equal amounts of coordination and skill with either, rather than having a primary left or right hand. Those who possessed the trait were referred to as ambidextrous.\nSome considered it possible for the trait to be \"learned\" later in life through regularly training someone to use their less dominant hand. Possession of this trait was considered by many to be essential for fighting in a dual-weapon style,\nAmbidexterity could be artificially obtained by certain magic items, such as wearing the gloves of the balanced hands, the Nightthiefs Nimbleknife, or wielding both of the silver sickles of Soranth. However, when these magic items ceased to be worn or wielded, the user would cease to be ambidextrous.\nAmbidexterity was most commonly exhibited among rogues and warriors. Some particular types of rogues or warriors known for exhibiting this trait included acrobats, assassins, duelists, sharpshooters, and swashbucklers, and weapon masters. And many of the fighter-rogue slavers of the Xanathars Thieves Guild were known to be ambidextrous.\nOther types of adventurers in the Realms that were commonly seen to exhibit this trait included blades, bladesingers, and breachgnomes.\nBeyond humans and demihumans, for whom ambidexterity was not an innate trait to all members of a given race malenti, and thri-kreen. For some races ambidexterity was quite common, but not an absolute certainty, such as being exhibited by most tieflings and wang-liang. Some undead were gifted with this trait regardless of whether or not the person they were in life was ambidextrous, such as deathbringers.\nWhen Nymorah, an annual peace festival and tournament in Ravens Bluff that was enacted by Lord Mayor Sirrus Melandor, was first held one of the teams that competed was Pure and Passionate, a group of Tormtar women from Tantras. Among their numbers were three half-elf rangers that were all ambidextrous.\nthumb|200px|A fierce ambidextrous battle is waged by Drizzt DoUrden and Artemis Entreri on the cover of Neverwinter.\n* Aldamair Galashar.\n* Ambron Larksong.\n* Amraith, a moon elf fighter adventurer.\n* Artemis Entreri.\n* Berden Akavian.\n* Blade, a Night Parader fighter.\n* Boridin, a Zhent rogue that operated in Thesk.\n* Cesna, a blackguard Night Parader.\n* Douglas Fairbanks, a man who was known for his extreme ambidexterity.
