        "mainbody": "Ambidexterity''' was the mundane ability or trait to proficiently use both hands in any given task,<ref> having equal amounts of coordination and skill with either, rather than having a primary left or right hand. Those who possessed the trait were referred to as '''ambidextrous'''.\n\nSome considered it possible for the trait to be \"learned\" later in life through regularly training someone to use their less dominant hand. Possession of this trait was considered by many to be essential for fighting in a dual-weapon style,{{Cite web/Drow Fighting Styles}}",
        "Magic": "Ambidexterity could be artificially obtained by certain [[magic item]]s, such as wearing the ''[[gloves of the balanced hands]]'', ''[[the Nightthief's Nimbleknife]]'', or wielding both of the ''[[Silver sickle of Soranth|silver sickles of Soranth]]''.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 10}} However, when these magic items ceased to be worn or wielded, the user would cease to be ambidextrous.",
        "Society": "Ambidexterity was most commonly exhibited among [[rogue]]s and [[warrior]]s. Some particular types of rogues or warriors known for exhibiting this trait included [[acrobat]]s,<ref><ref> [[assassin]]s,<ref> [[duelist]]s, [[sharpshooter]]s, and [[swashbuckler]]s,<ref> and [[weapon master]]s. And many of the fighter-rogue slavers of the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]] were known to be ambidextrous.<ref>\n\nOther types of adventurers in the Realms that were commonly seen to exhibit this trait included [[Blade (class)|blades]],<ref> [[bladesinger]]s, and [[breachgnome]]s.<ref>\n\nBeyond [[human]]s and [[demihuman]]s, for whom ambidexterity was not an innate trait to all members of a given race [[malenti]],{{Cite organized play/LC/Pirates of Yore|17}}<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/News of the World|9-12,24-27,29}} and [[thri-kreen]].<ref> For some races ambidexterity was quite common, but not an absolute certainty, such as being exhibited by most [[tiefling]]s and [[wang-liang]]. Some [[undead]] were gifted with this trait regardless of whether or not the person they were in life was ambidextrous, such as [[deathbringer (creature)|deathbringers]].<ref>",
        "History": "When [[Nymorah]], an annual peace festival and tournament in [[Ravens Bluff]] that was enacted by Lord Mayor [[Sirrus Melandor]],<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Glory of the Game|4}} was first held one of the teams that competed was [[Pure and Passionate]], a group of [[Tormtar]] women from [[Tantras]].
