The '''Shandril's Saga''' trilogy by [[Ed Greenwood]] covers the adventures of [[Shandril Shessair]]. The second book was originally part of the loosely-connected [[The Harpers series|Harpers series]], but as the story of Shandril Shessair became more fleshed out and the books became more popular they were joined together as a separate series.
