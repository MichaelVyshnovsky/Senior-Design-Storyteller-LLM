An Ethrans rate of advancement often depended on their personal relationship with her superiors. Most Ethrans were clerics or sorcerers. Thousands of Ethrans were spread across Rashemen, usually serving as village healers or spirit-talkers.\nBefore partaking of their maiden journey outside of Rashemen, all ethrans were ordained within the Urlingwood."
