As they advanced, they could summon swarms of spiders to attack at their command with ''[[summon swarm]]'', ''[[insect plague]]'', and ''[[creeping doom]]''. They could also create a spider mount with ''[[phantom steed]]''; enlarge spiders, [[centipede]]s, and [[scorpion]]s with ''[[giant vermin]]''; and turn rocks into spiders ''[[stone spiders]]''. Finally, they could forcibly transform other people into spiders, with ''[[spider curse]]'' turning another being into an obedient [[drider]]-like creature, and ''[[spider shapes]]'' turning multiple willing beings into [[monstrous spider]]s.",
