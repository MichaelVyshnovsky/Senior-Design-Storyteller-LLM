'''Farforevermore''' was a rebellious subculture among nobles and the youth of wannabe-noble, rising merchant houses, in both the cities of [[Athkatla]] and [[Waterdeep]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Those who were part of the subculture were referred to as "Forevers".{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/Noble Subcultures}}

This subculture involved adopting a persona in which one dressed and acted in the ways that a city's nobility had done a century prior, such as old-fashioned courting or the keeping (and even flogging) of [[slavery|slaves]]. When accused of playacting, most Forevers would hotly deny the accusation and insist that they were improving both themselves and their city, referring to the nobiltiy of the prior century as having "better" ways of life.

Forevers often maintained hidden rooms or private attic spaces, using them to change from their everyday clothes to that of their persona. They also tended to pool funds together with other Forevers in order to host revels or rent out mansions where they could carry out their playacting.
