Orbyn (the Edge of Justice) was a longsword crafted for Duar Obarskyr by Amedahast, and one of the Cormyrean Swords of State. It had a soft glow, similar in intensity to the full moon, and was covered in faint runes that, to the wielder, seem to move.
Orbyn was also known as Orblyn.  The alternative pronounciation originated from a speech impediment of a former king of Cormyr. 
The sword was used to slay both the dragon Thauglorimorgorus and Magrath the Minotaur.
As of 1479 DR the sword resided in the Shrine of the Four Swords in Cormyrs Royal Court, and was used both as a means of swearing oaths in the Royal Court and as a weapon to execute nobility found to be guilty of capital crimes.
