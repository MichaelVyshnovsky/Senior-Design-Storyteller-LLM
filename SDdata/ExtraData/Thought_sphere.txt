The '''Thought sphere''' was a group of spells granted to [[monk]]s that followed deities of knowledge and learning. These spells treated thoughts as objects to be discovered and manipulated, even altering reality.

==Spells in the Sphere of Thought==
Many spells were available to those who had chosen this sphere.

Beginner spellcasters of this sphere could cast:
* ''[[emotion read]]''
* ''[[thought capture]]''
Novice divine spellcasters were able to cast:
* ''[[idea]]''
* ''[[mind read]]''
Somewhat skilled spellcasters were able to cast:
* ''[[emotion control]]''
* ''[[memory read]]''
* ''[[telepathy]]''
Intermediate divine casters had the ability to use:
* ''[[genius]]''
* ''[[mental domination]]''
* ''[[modify memory]]''<ref group="note">This was classified as a ''[[time sphere]]'' spell in the ''[[Tome of Magic 2nd edition]]'' (page 83) and probably should have been in the thought sphere instead.
* ''[[rapport]]''
* ''[[solipsism]]''
* ''[[thought broadcast]]''
Those with a high level of skill had access to:
* ''[[impregnable mind]]''
* ''[[memory wrack]]''
* ''[[mindshatter]]''
* ''[[thoughtwave]]''
Powerful monks of such a sphere were able to cast:
* ''[[disbelief]]''
* ''[[group mind]]''
Divine spellcasters who had mastered this sphere could cast:
* ''[[divine inspiration]]''<ref group="note">This spell was removed from the thought sphere in the ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'' sourcebook. See page 188. It was probably misclassified as being in both spheres of divinity and thought on page 106 of the ''[[Tome of Magic 2nd edition]]'' sourcebook
* ''[[impervious sanctity of mind]]''
* ''[[mind tracker]]''<ref group="note">This spell is incorrectly called "mindkiller" in the list of thought spells on page 154 of ''[[Tome of Magic 2nd edition]]''. It was probably misclassified as being in another sphere on page 107. It is included in the list of thought spells on page 188 of ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'', which is a more recent publication.
