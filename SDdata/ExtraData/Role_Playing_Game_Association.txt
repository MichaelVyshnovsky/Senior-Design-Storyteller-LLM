The '''Role Playing Game Association''', also known as '''RPGA''', was an organized play association founded in 1980, most notably known for it's [[Living City]] program.

==History==
RPGA was originally founded by [[TSR, Inc.]] as a way to promote their products by creating a "club for role-playing gamers". The person assigned to this task and the eventual founder of the association, was [[Frank Mentzer]], one of TSR's first full-time employees. Among the systems used in the first organized plays was [[AD&D]].

The plays proved to be a very popular concept with the RPG community. The longest running one was [[Living City]] (originally started in 1987), while the one that attracted the largest amount of players over it's lifespan was [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Greyhawk Living Greyhawk].

The "living campaigns" organized by the association were the first of its kind, and the format of the universe being shared between all the players in different sessions became the main inspiration for MMORPG games.

In 2010, RPGA began to run the D&D Encounters program, which later was continued by the [[Adventurers League]], which effectively replaced the Role Playing Game Association in 2014.

==List of Programs==
The following programs ran by RPGA took place in the [[Realms]]:

* [[Living City]]

* [[Sarbreenar the Living City]]
