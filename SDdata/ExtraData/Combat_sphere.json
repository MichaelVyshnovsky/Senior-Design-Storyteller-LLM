On page 175 of the Players Option Spells & Magic, where this spell is defined, it says it is a war sphere spell. However, in the appendix on page 186, it is listed in the combat sphere instead. Since the war sphere is mainly concerned with BATTLESYSTEM&trade campaigns and entire units of NPCs, it seems more likely that this spell belongs in the combat sphere.\nPowerful spellcasters of such a sphere were able to cast\n* spiritual wrath\n* word of recall\nDivine spellcasters who had mastered this sphere could cast\n* holy/unholy word"
