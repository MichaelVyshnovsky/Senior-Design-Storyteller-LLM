        "Spells in the Sphere of Combat": "Junior casters of this sphere could use:\n* ''[[command]]''\n* ''[[magical stone]]''\n* ''[[shillelagh]]''\nNovice divine spellcasters were able to cast:\n* ''[[aid]]''\n* ''[[chant]]''\n* ''[[spiritual hammer]]''\nSomewhat skilled spellcasters were able to cast:\n* ''[[prayer (spell)|prayer]]''\n* ''[[unearthly choir]]''\nIntermediate clerics and druids had the ability to cast:\n* ''[[recitation]]''\nThose with a high level of skill had access to:\n* ''[[flame strike]]''\n* ''[[insect plague]]''\n* ''[[righteous wrath of the faithful]]''<ref group=\"note\">There is some confusion about the sphere to which this spell belongs. On page 175 of the ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'', where this spell is defined, it says it is a ''[[war sphere]]'' spell. However, in the appendix on page 186, it is listed in the ''combat sphere'' instead. Since the war sphere is mainly concerned with BATTLESYSTEM&trade; campaigns and entire units of NPCs, it seems more likely that this spell belongs in the combat sphere.\nPowerful spellcasters of such a sphere were able to cast:\n* ''[[spiritual wrath]]''\n* ''[[word of recall]]''\nDivine spellcasters who had mastered this sphere could cast:\n* ''[[holy word|holy/unholy word]]''"
