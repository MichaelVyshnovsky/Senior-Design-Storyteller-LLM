        "mainbody": "'''divine focus''' was a basic part of casting [[Divine magic|divine]] spells.\n\nA divine focus was an item or object of spiritual significance for the caster. For [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s it was often a [[holy symbol]] associated with their [[deity]] or religious order. For [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s was often a piece of a plant such as a sprig of holly or mistletoe. Evil-aligned clerics also used a divine focus in their spellcasting, which was usually their unholy symbol."
