        "Description": "[[File:Ceremorphosis-drow-3e.jpg|thumb|300px|''A mind flayer bringing a tadpole to its future drow host.'']]\nUpon securing a suitable host, mind flayers began the procedure by rendering the candidate docile with a ''[[mind blast]]''. was then inserted in the host's cranium through a nostril, ear canal, or eye socket. It then burrowed into the brain and quickly devoured the gray matter, growing in the process as it replaced the brain with its own tissue and attached itself to the brain stem like a parasite. This initial process, which happened over a period of a few hours, effectively completely replaced the victim's personality with the tadpole's, while still keeping the body alive for the second stage of the transformation.\n\nIt was only possible to interrupt ceremorphosis and save the host before this initial stage was completed, and even so it was only possible to do so by killing the tadpole, which was complicated by its location. The safest way was to incinerate or crush the host's head and then use [[spell]]s such as ''[[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]]'', or ''[[true resurrection]]''. Destroyed parts of the victim's personality could then be reconstructed via ''[[restoration]]'' and ''[[heal]]'' spells, as long as the damage was not complete.\n\nAfter the initial stage was completed, the original creature was beyond help, their psychic essence destroyed and replaced by the tadpole's burgeoning min, lost save for a ''[[miracle]]''. Past the point of no return, the victim's [[spirit]] would have to seek its fate on the [[Outer Planes]]. Over a period of approximately one week, the host's body underwent extensive morphological and tissue changes, completely transforming into a mind flayer. Internal organs were reshaped, but retained their original purpose. Until ceremorphosis was completed, the emerging mind flayer remained helpless.\n\nThe newly formed mind flayer, despite being fully grown, was equivalent to an infant, and had to undergo a period of instruction and experience that lasted approximately twenty years, usually within the confines of a secure illithid city.\n\nThe physiological changes caused by ceremorphosis played a key role in the illithids' dietary habits. Since the tadpole acted more like a parasite of its host's body than a proper brain, it did not produce the enzymes and psychic energy necessary to keep it alive. These essential nutrients needed to be acquired through consumed brains for the body to survive.\n\nAn illithid tadpole that survived but was not submitted to ceremorphosis grew out of control into an enormous rampaging predator called a [[neothelid]].",

        "History": "As late as the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], some scholars believed that illithids reproduced by experimenting or tampering with the reproductive systems of other creatures rather than via ceremorphosis.\n\nSome sages believed that ceremorphosis had been a late development in the evolution of the mind flayer species. Evidence of this was found in the shape of their two-toed webbed feet, which suggested a pre-ceremorphic race of water dwellers."
