The tadpole ate away the victims brain matter and essentially replaced the brain, erasing all of the subjects personality and memory, but leaving the physical body alive and under the tadpoles control. After this, morphological transformations occurred and after a week a new illithid was created.\nIt was common for the newly formed illithid to retain a few memories of its former host. Those memories were merely vestigial and rarely affected the new individuals personality.\nthumb|300px|A mind flayer bringing a tadpole to its future drow host.\nUpon securing a suitable host, mind flayers began the procedure by rendering the candidate docile with a mind blast. was then inserted in the hosts cranium through a nostril, ear canal, or eye socket. It then burrowed into the brain and quickly devoured the gray matter, growing in the process as it replaced the brain with its own tissue and attached itself to the brain stem like a parasite. This initial process, which happened over a period of a few hours, effectively completely replaced the victims personality with the tadpoles, while still keeping the body alive for the second stage of the transformation.\nIt was only possible to interrupt ceremorphosis and save the host before this initial stage was completed, and even so it was only possible to do so by killing the tadpole, which was complicated by its location. The safest way was to incinerate or crush the hosts head and then use spells such as resurrection, or true resurrection. Destroyed parts of the victims personality could then be reconstructed via restoration and heal spells, as long as the damage was not complete.\nAfter the initial stage was completed, the original creature was beyond help, their psychic essence destroyed and replaced by the tadpoles burgeoning min, lost save for a miracle. Past the point of no return, the victims spirit would have to seek its fate on the Outer Planes. Over a period of approximately one week, the hosts body underwent extensive morphological and tissue changes, completely transforming into a mind flayer. Internal organs were reshaped, but retained their original purpose. Until ceremorphosis was completed, the emerging mind flayer remained helpless.\nThe newly formed mind flayer, despite being fully grown, was equivalent to an infant, and had to undergo a period of instruction and experience that lasted approximately twenty years, usually within the confines of a secure illithid city.\nThe physiological changes caused by ceremorphosis played a key role in the illithids dietary habits. Since the tadpole acted more like a parasite of its hosts body than a proper brain, it did not produce the enzymes and psychic energy necessary to keep it alive. These essential nutrients needed to be acquired through consumed brains for the body to survive.\nAn illithid tadpole that survived but was not submitted to ceremorphosis grew out of control into an enormous rampaging predator called a neothelid.\nThe success of ceremorphosis was only guaranteed with a few humanoid races. In particular, only humans, elves, drow, githyanki, githzerai, grimlocks, gnolls, human-sized goblinoids, and orcs produced viable mind flayers. In addition, the candidates height and weight also played a role in the process, since body mass was a factor in the tadpoles growth rate. Only humanoids weighing between  and with heights between  were considered acceptable. Creatures outside that range caused the tadpoles evolution to proceed either too fast or too slowly, and both cases resulted in both the hosts and the tadpoles death.\nSome creatures were always considered unacceptable for ceremorphosis. Those included centaurs, derro, duergar, dwarves, giants, halflings, and kuo-toa. Any attempt to conduct ceremorphosis in one of those races invariably resulted in death for the host and the tadpole. Most non-mammalian species were also considered incompatible in principle.\nWhile gnomes were also normally considered unacceptable candidates to ceremorphosis,\nSince the height and weight ranges were a more determinant factor than species in the success of ceremorphosis, in principle even other races that fell within those ranges could still be compatible. For that reason, mind flayers constantly conducted experiments with newly found creatures.\n cellspacing=0\n+ style=\"font-sizelargerfont-familyGeorgia,seriffont-weightboldtext-aligncenter\"  Ceremorphs\n-\n!

If successful, the new creature retained parts of its old personality and some of its memories. If the attempt was unsuccessful, a deformed creature known as a gnome squidling resulted.\nIllithiderro\n The result of a bizarre illthid breeding program with derro. Alternatively known as \"madminds\" and notable for their high reproduction rate.\nMindwitness\n The result of implanting a tadpole in a captured beholder, these creatures were used as telepathic amplifiers to improve communication within the colony.\nMozgriken\n The result of a tadpole being inserted into a deep gnome and then subjected to psychic surgery that channeled energy from the Shadowfell.\nTzakandi\n The result of illithid tadpoles being inserted into lizardfolk. They were used as personal guards and slave laborers.\nUchuulon\n Sometimes known as a slime chuul, it resulted from a chuul being implanted with an illithid tadpole.\nUrophion\n Created to serve as guardians for a mind flayer community. An urophion was a roper that had survived the tadpole implantation process. They were usually treated as second-class citizens but were permitted to join with the elder brain upon death.\nYuan-tillithid\nAn illithid/yuan-ti hybrid. They had viper heads and scaly tentacles. Located in Sszuraassnee.\nMany other creatures, such as greater doppelgangers, were subject to becoming half-illithids but did not necessarily have unique names as in the preceding examples. Such transformations tended to involve the creature developing psionic abilities, sprouting illithid-like tentacles&mdashassuming the creature did not already have tentacles&mdashand acquiring a taste for eating brains.\nAs late as the 14 century DR, some scholars believed that illithids reproduced by experimenting or tampering with the reproductive systems of other creatures rather than via ceremorphosis.\nSome sages believed that ceremorphosis had been a late development in the evolution of the mind flayer species. Evidence of this was found in the shape of their two-toed webbed feet, which suggested a pre-ceremorphic race of water dwellers."
