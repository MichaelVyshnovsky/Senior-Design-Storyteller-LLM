        "mainbody": "he Curse of Amun-Re was the name given to the curse called down by the pharaoh Amun-Re of Bakar upon his death, around the year .\nAround the year , a riot broke out in Terbakar due to the pharaoh Amun-Res tax policies and warmongering. The Pharaoh threatened that, were his heart to stop beating, so would the magical fountain of the River Athis. This he called down in the name of Osiris, his staff of ruling, and the Star of Mo-Pelar. Immediately, he was struck by a spear, killing him. In death, Osiris was bound to grant his curse, as it was called down in his name, but the Pharaoh would also be denied access to Heaven Westward, where the souls of his lineage went after death. The curse was not to be removed until the implements by which the curse was called down were removed from his tomb.\nThe drying of the river meant a slow death for Bakar and for all of the cities along its banks, including Pazar, Akhir, Phoenix, and even as far north as Medinat Muskawoon, which depended indirectly on the fountain of Athis to replenish its underground aquifers.\nThe pharaoh would become an apparition that attempted to draw adventurers to ransack the tomb throughout the quickly desertified lands of Bakar one such group of adventurers, which accidentally released the efreeti Pasha Khalitharius, finally succeeded at this task in  therefore restoring the fountain of the River Athis."
