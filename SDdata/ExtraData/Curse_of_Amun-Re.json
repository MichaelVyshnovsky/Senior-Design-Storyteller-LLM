        "Overview": "Around the year {{yearlink|300}}, a riot broke out in [[Terbakar]] due to the pharaoh Amun-Re's tax policies and warmongering. The Pharaoh threatened that, were his heart to stop beating, so would the magical fountain of the River Athis. This he called down in the name of [[Osiris]], his [[staff of ruling]], and the [[Star of Mo-Pelar]]. Immediately, he was struck by a spear, killing him. In death, Osiris was bound to grant his curse, as it was called down in his name, but the Pharaoh would also be denied access to Heaven Westward, where the souls of his lineage went after death. The curse was not to be removed until the implements by which the curse was called down were removed from his tomb.\n\nThe drying of the river meant a slow death for Bakar and for all of the cities along its banks, including [[Pazar]], [[Akhir]], [[Phoenix]],{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|4-5}} and even as far north as [[Medinat Muskawoon]], which depended indirectly on the fountain of Athis to replenish its underground aquifers.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|94}}\n\nThe pharaoh would become an apparition that attempted to draw adventurers to ransack the tomb throughout the quickly desertified lands of Bakar; one such group of adventurers, which accidentally released the [[efreeti]] Pasha [[Khalitharius]],{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|30}} finally succeeded at this task in {{yearlink|1356}} therefore restoring the fountain of the River Athis.{{Cite dragon/424/Martek and the Desert of Desolation|17}}"
