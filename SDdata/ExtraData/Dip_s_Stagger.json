        "mainbody": "Dips Stagger was a violent game of sorts enjoyed in the Cutters Dip tavern in Yhaunn, Sembia, in the late 14 century DR.\nIn the game, the patrons of the tavern would seize upon a vulnerable visitor who had earned their ire, and proceed to shove, hurl, and slam them about the tavern, cheering \"Dip!\" and \"Stagger!\" with each heave. The victim would be left bruised, dazed, confused, and soaked in cheap alcohol, unable to mount any sort of resistance to the constant strikes that bounced them across the room. The game would continue until the patrons grew bored, the victim escaped, or something else interrupted it.\nA notable instance of the game was held in the , when the werewolf and priestess of Selûne Feena Archwood investigated the tavern for clues regarding the local cult of Shar. She had the misfortune to be recognized by the bandits Stag and Drik, who proceeded to assault her and drag her into a game of Dips Stagger. Despite being an experienced champion of Selûne, Feena was left reeling and unable to raise any sort of defense, and couldnt even muster her will towards shapeshifting into a werewolf. She avoided whatever fate awaited her at the end of the game by chance, when the final \"Dip!\" sent her tumbling into the lap of the dissolute Sharran acolyte Keph Thingoleir, who proceeded to rescue her mostly out of idle contrarian opposition to her enemies."
