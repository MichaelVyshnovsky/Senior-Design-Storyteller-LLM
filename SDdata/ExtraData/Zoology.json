These included amorphous monsters (such as slimes and jellies), amphibians, aquatic monsters, birds, fish, hybrid monsters (such as griffons or perytons), mundane insects, insectoid monsters, mundane mammals, mammalian monsters, mundane reptiles, and reptilian monsters.\n* Entomology the study of arachnids and insects, both mundane and giant.\n* Herpetology the study of amphibians and/or reptiles.\n* Ichthyology the study of fish and fish-like creatures.\n* Ornithology the study of birds and bird-like creatures.\n* Some sages studied a class of monsters that was known as \"aberrant zoology\". These sages focused their efforts on capturing, documenting, and explaining aberrations.\nScrolls were often used by zoologists to collect, preserve, and communicate the knowledge they obtained to other zoologists and lay persons. This knowledge typically regarded the anatomy, diet, and behaviors of an animal.\nThe value of these scrolls varied depending upon the animal discussed and a buyers profession, though almost all types were of interest to sages. They were often of interest to professions that handled animals, such as farmers, furriers, hunters, ranchers, shepherds, and swineherds. Entomology scrolls were often valued by beekeepers, druids, and farmers. Herpetology scrolls were often valued by hunters and druids that dwelled in marshes, jungles, or swamps. Ornithological scrolls were often valued by artists, bird-watchers, falconers, fletchers, and fowlers. And finally, ichthyological scrolls were often valued by fishermen as well as druids that dwelled along the coast or shore.\nBesides scrolls, some wrote books regarding their findings, such as Volos Guide to Monsters, Tyms Monstrous Book, or the more narrowly focused Entomology Encyclopedia.\nIn the city of Huzuz, the university Al-Bidir Sallahs \"College of the Sciences\" offered courses in zoology.\nThe third through fifth floors of the Vault of the Sages contained study rooms for topics of learning, including zoology.\nIn any decent-sized city, a sage specialized in zoology could be found with a 20% chance, or 30% in Sembia, around 1358 DR.\n* Ainsbrith\n* Bremaerel\n* Elmdaerle\n* Raash\n* Ramazith Flamesinger was a sage who specialized in the study of intelligent marine life.\n* Tym, an evoker who authored Tyms Monstrous Book. He devoted much of his life to documenting the strengths, weaknesses, and ecology of various monsters found in Faer√ªn, being especially fascinated by those of a magical nature.\nCategoryFields of study\ngbfbdn4mqfpkzbi17oc9k4etxgxv12r"
