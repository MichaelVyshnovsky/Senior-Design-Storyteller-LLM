The psionicist entered a different reality where no one could detect him in any way. The psionicist could not interact with anything but could position himself wherever he wished, appearing to real time people that he vanished and reappeared several minutes later. The psionicist did not exist in the traditional sense while waiting for time to catch up to them, therefore they were not affected by anything that happened during that time.\n* Vhondryl, a psionicist in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor\nCategoryPsychoportation powers\nesq64sao3r6sccn2egjzxa0j86f4t3n"
