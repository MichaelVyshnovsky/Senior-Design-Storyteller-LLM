See pages 186-187. This spell was added in the ''[[Tome of Magic 2nd edition]]'' as a ''wards sphere'' spell, but was listed in the elemental sphere on page 152. The ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'' appears to have corrected this oversight.\n* ''[[grounding]]''\n* ''[[shrieking walls]]''\n* ''[[undead ward]]''\nPowerful spellcasters of such a sphere were able to cast:\n* ''[[crushing walls]]''\n* ''[[dragonbane]]''\n* ''[[land of stability]]''\nDivine spellcasters who had mastered this sphere could cast:\n* ''[[tentacle walls]]''",
