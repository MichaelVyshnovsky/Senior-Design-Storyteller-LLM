However, the original owned by the Asmodeus main body was made from a shard of evil and merely tipped with a ruby.\nThese  rods had an opaline tip looking like a clawed fist clutching a skull and a jagged bottom that looked like the rod was actually part of something bigger and snapped off from that bigger something. They were covered with good deities and celestials names, all spelled in reverse and sullied with black blood.\nThese rods gave off a soft red light. Upon shooting energy blasts, the rods gave off beams of light in every direction.\nOne of the easiest ways to use a Ruby Rod of Asmodeus in combat was to use it as a bludgeon. Used like that, a Ruby Rod worked like a +6 unholy greatclub or inflict light wounds in the +1 morningstar version. Having Asmodeus permission to wield a Ruby Rod allowed a person to wield it without getting hurt.\nAs mentioned above, Ruby Rods could shoot energy beams. To be more precise, there were three versions—a 150-foot (45-meter) beam of electricity, a beam of acid that was the same length, or a 75-foot (23-meters) cone of intense cold. The abilities could be used as often as he wanted by Asmodeus but only once per day by other people.\nThe Ruby Rod had three protective abilities. One forced people to bow down before the wielder, thereby making it impossible for them to attack the wielder. The second one was about creating a wall of force around the wielder as well as a 50-foot (15-meter) radius antimagic field that magically repaired the wielder, first by making away with detrimental enchantment effects, then with mundane detriments like lost body parts that grow back, diseases, and poison-induced effects, and at last with a full recovery of the wielders physical health and magical energy. The last ability could be activated intentionally but did so automatically whenever the wielder fell victim to an enchantment effect. The abilities could be used as often as he wanted by Asmodeus, but only once per day by other people. Third, it could protect the wielder from spells by absorbing them into the rod. However, this use of the rod was not unlimited.\nThe original Ruby Rod of Asmodeus was created by Asmodeus from the shard of evil, which he broke off from the bottom of the Abyss and killed He Who Was, his superior at the time. The crafting of the rod required the shard of evil and He Who Was death at the hand of Asmodeus who used the Ruby Rod for the deed.\nAccording to the play The Trial of Asmodeus, which was allegedly based on facts, Asmodeus was obliged to always carry the Ruby Rod of Asmodeus by Primus. The rod would act both as a symbol for him and his devils right to forge pacts with mortals and as a punishment device for all devils that do not respect the strictures of their bargains.\nEvery avatar of Asmodeus carried a Ruby Rod of Asmodeus as a symbol of the office Asmodeus held, which was the one as overlord of Baator and as the one to whom all devils had to obey.\nAll avatars of Asmodeus owned a Ruby Rod of Asmodeus, as did aspects of his—at least they owned some downgraded version of it.\nSometimes, Asmodeus gave a Ruby Rod to somebody else. However, it was never known if what he gave was a replica or the genuine thing.\nCategoryGreater artifacts\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryRods\nCategoryPlus-6 items\nr28qzl4287eeil83xlxzlgc1qiouajj"
