The portals would remain as long as the psionicist expended psychic energy. The portals could only be used from a single side, allowing up to five individuals to step through at a time.\nStepping through a dimensional door was disorienting, dazing travelers and preventing them from performing complex tasks for a minute after traveling.\n* Vhondryl, a psionicist in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor"
