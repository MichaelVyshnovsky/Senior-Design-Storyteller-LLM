        "mainbody": "Faerie fire was a evocation or alteration spell that outlined a target.\nFaerie fire caused a glowing lining around targets in a selected area.\nAll versions of the spell made a target easier to hit, but the post-Spellplague version also caused radiant damage and slowed the target. The pre-Spellplague version negated the effects of spells like blur or darkness.\nOther than the usual vocal and somatic components one version needed foxfire.\nDrow had the innate ability to cast faerie fire. This ability was granted to them by Faerzress. The drow used the ability in combat as well as to decorate their cities.\nExperienced knights of the Blue Moon gained the ability to cast faerie fire up to three times per day."
