'''''Nakhuda''''' (pl. '''''nawakhid''''') was the term used to describe someone who owned a sailing vessel in [[Zakhara]].

==Activities==
These individuals did not have to be the captain of a ship, but the person who held the papers of ownership for the vessel. ''Nakhuda'' typically did not issue orders regarding the daily activities, but determined the ultimate goals of the ship and its passengers or crew. Most of their work was typically done while in port.
