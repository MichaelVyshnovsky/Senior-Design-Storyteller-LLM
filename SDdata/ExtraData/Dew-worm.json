        "mainbody": "ew-worms, also known as whiteworms, were a large species of earthworm found in the Realms.\nThese creatures were similar in size to bookworms and rot grubs.\nParticularly large dew-worms could be found in Tashalar. \nDew-worms preserved in rose-wine jelly was a regional delicacy of Tashalar, though many found this tradition to be disgusting. And the Copper Coronet, a tavern in Athkatla, often had dew-worms in its stews."
