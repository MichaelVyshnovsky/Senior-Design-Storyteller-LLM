|''[[Hillsfar (game)|Hillsfar]]''<ref group="note">Though not in the same style as the other games of the series, ''[[Hillsfar (game)|Hillsfar]]'' is indeed part of the plot tying together ''[[Pool of Radiance (game)|Pool of Radiance]]'' and ''[[Curse of the Azure Bonds (game)|Curse of the Azure Bonds]]''. Transferring a character from ''Hillsfar'' to ''Curse of the Azure Bonds'' unlocks extra content in the latter. Furthermore, the manual for the latter game states that the party ventures to Phlan (''Pool of Radiance''), then Hillsfar (''Hillsfar''), and then to Tilverton (''Curse of the Azure Bonds''): "Like most heroes, however, the adventurers who freed Phlan did not stay around. It is known that they took a boat from Phlan to the City of Hillsfar across the Moonsea. From there it is rumored that they traveled south and west in search of further adventure". Thus, for lore-based reasons, ''Hillsfar'' is grouped within this series.

|''[[Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor]]''<ref group="note">This game, which came a decade later, is not connected to the previous games by being a typical sequel, and uses a much newer engine. It is connected to the first game in terms of location, setting, and name. It is also licensed to be part of this series. For this reason, ''[[Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor]]'' is included as part of the series.

|''[[Dungeons & Dragons: Eye of the Beholder]]''<ref group="note">This Game Boy Advance game is not a direct port of the original game. Only some features are very similar, such as the story. However, the combat system is much more like the classic ''Gold Box'' games, instead of first-person dungeon combat. Due to licensing and the name, it is thus classed as part of this series.

It is also not connected to the plot in the ''[[Neverwinter Nights series]]'', but it shares the name. Due to this, and potential licensing reasons, it is classed as part of this series.
