'''Pluma''' or '''feathermagic''' was a form of [[divine magic]] practiced by priests of [[Qotal]] in [[Maztica]]. Feathermagic took its name from the colorful feathers required to work the magic. Feathermagic was used primarily to [[enchantment|enchant]] objects such as [[feather armor]] and to create useful magical items such as elevator-like lifts or [[Plumalitter|floating litters]] to carry a person. Feathermagic was the magic of feathers and air.<ref>
