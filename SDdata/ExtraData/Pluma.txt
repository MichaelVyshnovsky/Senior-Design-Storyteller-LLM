Pluma or feathermagic was a form of divine magic practiced by priests of Qotal in Maztica. Feathermagic took its name from the colorful feathers required to work the magic. Feathermagic was used primarily to enchant objects such as feather armor and to create useful magical items such as elevator-like lifts or floating litters to carry a person. Feathermagic was the magic of feathers and air.
