        "mainbody": "Dlurn paste was a type of fish paste for which the city of Derlusk was known for in the 14 century DR, derived from the salted dlurn fish that was endemic to its waters.\nDlurn paste had a green coloration of a nauseating hue, but a pleasant smell. It had a long shelf life and was highly salty, requiring many who partook in it to drink.\nThis fish paste was commonly used as a condiment, with many spreading it thickly across biscuits."
