False piety was considered a sin, but being prejudiced against others on the quality of their faith was disapproved of in the Creed.The Creeds view on \"false piety\" is actually ambiguous. For reference, the text on page 81 of Sword Coast Adventurers Guide says \"…a few bad apples in their midst have given Berduskans a reputation for the sin of false piety—pretending to a stronger faith than one actually possesses. Though this attitude is disapproved of by the Creed, it has given rise in other parts of Elturgard to the expression as holy as a Berduskan priest—which is to say, not very.\" This may be interpreted as the Creed disapproving of false piety, of judging others for the quality of their piety, or of being prejudiced against a people. This article adopts an interpretation that seems to best fit the apparent intent and depictions in Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide and Sword Coast Adventurers Guide.\nIf one of the Companions or Hellriders overstepped the limits of law or proper behavior, or even questioned the policies of the realm (such as exactly why there was a temple to Bane in Soubar), their comrades would admonish them to \"recall the Creed\" and the matter was resolved, or at least forgotten.\nElturian citizens who were old enough to read were required to put a hand on the Tome of the Creed Resolute and recite the oath. Once done, their name magically appeared in the book, thus recording all those whod sworn to follow the Creed.\nThe Creed Resolute, the Companions, and the Hellriders were held in the highest regard in Elturgard. Disrespecting the Creed would incur the rage of the common folk before even those whod sworn it.\nFollowing the coming of the Companion, the second sun that appeared over Elturel and blasted to ash the vampires and other undead that plagued the city in the , many pilgrims journeyed to see it, including many paladins. The best of the paladins was appointed ruler of Elturel, titled the High Observer. However, with none knowing which god had brought the Companion, the first High Observer then established the Order of the Companion and created the Creed Resolute to keep the paladins of different faiths in order.\nAlthough originally intended to quell arguments among the Companions, the Creed Resolute was later adopted by the Hellriders of Elturel.\nAfter 1489 DR, Thavius made all Elturians swear to follow the Creed Resolute, making them oathbound to defend Elturel, but in the process binding the whole population to the city and to his deal with the archdevil Zariel, which included the citys \"oathbound defenders\". After the deal was concluded and Elturel was transported to Avernus, first layer of the Nine Hells, in the , those whod sworn by the Creed Resolute, like Reya Mantlemorn, felt compelled to go to the city.In Sword Coast Adventurers Guide, the Creed Resolute was originally followed by the Companions, and later the Hellriders. Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus has all citizens sworn to follow the Creed Resolute. Assuming this is not a contradiction, it appears the Creed was instituted city-wide over 1489–1494 DR, perhaps as part of Kreegs plot to betray the city and its whole populace. Notably, the Creed Resolute is not mentioned in the text of Kreegs pact, suggesting it was originally unrelated. Ultimately, the Creed would bind the Elturians to fight and even die for Zariel in her eternal wars in the Hells, even after Kreegs death."
