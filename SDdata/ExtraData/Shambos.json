An adult sea turtle carapace would yield thirty-seven plates if cut by a skilled craftsman who knew how to regulate the heat required to separate them without ruining the color.  The thirteen inner plates, known as \"blades\", were valued for artistic ornamentation. The twenty-four remaining edge-plates were of little value because they were usually damaged at some time in the turtle's life. Shambos plates were valued from 1 gp to 5 gp each depending on size and quality.",
