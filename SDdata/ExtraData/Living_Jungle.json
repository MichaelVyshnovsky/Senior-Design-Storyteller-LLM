        "mainbody": "he Living Jungle (LJ) was an organized play program run by the Role-Playing Group Association (RPGA) for the 2 and 3 editions of Dungeons & Dragons set in the rainforests of Malatra.\n|\nIt was a spin-off of the Living City campaign and was coordinated by Kevin Melka and Dave Gross. The campaign was later taken over by Tom Prusa, who was joined by Stephen H. Jay, who went on to become Story Arc Coordinator.\nLike other Living campaigns, the actions of the players affected the entire campaign. It differed from others, however, owing to the low-magic nature of the campaign and by emphasizing roleplaying over combat.\nThe Living Jungle survived briefly during the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons but mostly used the 2nd edition ruleset. A total of eighty modules were published in all between February 1995 and August 2003.\n* Designer(s) Kevin Melka\n* Released February 1995\n* Designer(s) Tom Prusa\n* Released February 1995\n* Designer(s) Dave Gross\n* Released February 1995\n* Designer(s) David W.
