        "Description": "It was a spin-off of the [[Living City]] campaign and was coordinated by [[Kevin Melka]] and [[Dave Gross]]. The campaign was later taken over by [[Tom Prusa]], who was joined by [[Stephen H. Jay]], who went on to become Story Arc Coordinator.",
        "Gameplay": "Like other Living campaigns, the actions of the players affected the entire campaign. It differed from others, however, owing to the low-magic nature of the campaign and by emphasizing roleplaying over combat.",
        "History": "The Living Jungle survived briefly during the 3rd edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' but mostly used the 2nd edition ruleset. A total of eighty modules were published in all between February 1995 and August 2003.",
