Sarghelgg, meaning "valor in slaying", was a fighting style taught among poor drow. It made use of their natural agility and was used in conjunction with light weapons.
The style was very simple but required extensive training to become a master.
It focused on striking with a light weapon, for example the rapier, and maximizing a drows effectiveness with it.
The style exploited the natural dexterity of a drow by learning to use a light weapon with finesse,
"Valor in slaying" was a name given to bolster the confidence of the user, who otherwise had to make do with poor training.
While drow society was famous for the intrigue and strife among its high society, the common majoritys life was marked first and foremost by poverty, oppression, desperation, and accompanying lack of education and training opportunities, making this style the only choice for most common and low-ranked guards and soldiers.
Nevertheless, clerics of Kiaransalee, Lolth, and Vhaeraun also used this style because these deities all used light weapons as their favored weapon, and Lolth and the short sword for Vhaeraun. Wizards and sorcerers of martial inclination also practiced the basics of the style.
This style is based on the Improved Critical, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus feats of 3rd-edition Dungeons & Dragons the latter was generally given to drow warrior NPCs, such as in Monster Manual 3.5.
