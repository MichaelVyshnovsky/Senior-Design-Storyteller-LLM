A '''''ring ward''''' was a type of magical protection used in the kingdom of [[Cormyr]]. It was the weakest of three standard types of [[ward]]s employed by the king. Like each of the three standard wards, the actual [[spell]] to prepare the ward was a carefully guarded state secret, though it was similar to the spell known as ''[[wardmist]]''.

==Description==
A '''ring ward''' would apply a weak [[Electricity|electrical shock]] to any person not bearing a [[Purple Dragon ring]]. The shock was strong enough to turn away various [[animal]]s as well. In addition, any such unauthorized creature would trigger a light or sound alarm.

The ward also inhibited the casting of weaker spells in the vicinity.

==History==
The [[Arabellan Palace|palace]] in the city of [[Arabel]] had several floors protected by ''ring wards'', as did the gates of [[Oldstone Hall]] in [[Wheloon]].
