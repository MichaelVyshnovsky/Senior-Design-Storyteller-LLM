Trollspeak,
Rather than possessing a single racial language like many creatures on Toril, trolls spoke a variety of different mixed languages. Typified by a rather guttural speech, these tongues were mishmashes of corrupted loan words and phrases from other languages. The languages that Trollspeak typically loaned from were Common, Daraktan, Ghukliak, Hobgoblin, and Jotun. Trollspeak was also highly transient or regional, thus trolls from one area only had a one-in-fourth chance of understanding the Trollspeak of trolls from another area, such as the Trollspeak of the Troll Hills versus the Trollspeak of Thar.
Snow Troll The language spoken by snow trolls had a high-pitched, sing-song like quality to it. It was said to have over twenty different words for "prey", reflecting the subraces hunting culture.
Troll Hills For many in the Heartlands, saying that one "spoke Troll" referred exclusively to the shared language of trolls in the High Moor and Troll Hills.Though it is not specified within the text itself that "speaking troll" in this context is unique to the Heartlands, this can inferred due to the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting box-set being focused primarily on that region of Faer√ªn and both locations being within that region.The original text referred to the "High Moors", rather than the "High Moor". Due to the highly transient nature of Trollspeak and the High Moor being in far closer proximity to the Troll Hills, this is assumed to be an misspelling.
