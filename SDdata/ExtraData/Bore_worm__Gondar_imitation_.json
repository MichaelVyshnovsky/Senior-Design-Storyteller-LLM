        "Usage": "These constructs were considered by Gondsmen to be suitable for use as [[mount]]s.",
        "History": "Gondar [[cleric]]s delved deep into the bowels of [[Undermountain]] in the 15{{th}} century DR, bringing back with them parts from [[Trobriand's Graveyard]] that allowed members of their church to make smaller imitations of the bore worm."
