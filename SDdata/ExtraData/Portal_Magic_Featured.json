Creatures who are struck by the sphere have a slim chance of surviving, but will most likely be disintegrated, along with any non-living matter. Upon striking a creature, the sphere will stop moving and wait to be directed to a new target by its caster. If the sphere moves beyond the range of the spell, it winks out of existence."
