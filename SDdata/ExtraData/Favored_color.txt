A favored color was a minor manifestation of a deity.
Deities could show their powers through major manifestations and minor manifestations. A favored color fell into the latter category.
Most deities had some kind of color as their favored color. It was considered a minor and subtle manifestation but it was also the most frequent. For example, Silvanus could turn a tree brilliant green to inform a fugitive follower of a good escape route.
Followers of a particular deity often dressed in the favored color, particularly the clerics.
