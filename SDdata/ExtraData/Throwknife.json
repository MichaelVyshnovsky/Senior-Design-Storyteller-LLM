Contestants took turns standing in a circle drawn on the floor and throwing a knife (or dagger, or whatever pointed weapon was agreed upon) at a target drawn on a nearby wall. A \"best strike\" game was a quick contest to see who could hit closest to the center of the target. If portions of the target were assigned point values, then a game of \"forty-four\" was played to earn a total of exactly 44 points by hitting areas with designated point values and summing. A strike that pushed a persons total over 44 was ignored.\nthumb|center|450px|An escort at the Roaring Dragon House pretends to be inexperienced at throwknife in order to get attention from a patron.\nThrowknife was one of the few games of pure skill at the Roaring Dragon House outside Waterdeep. House rules dictated that weapons could only be drawn while standing inside a throwknife circle.\nCategorySports\nqcmeh2rnv6hvccdl7yi95zk0fe8g8lg"
