During the Darkwalker War, the Pack was taken over by the werewolf Erian, a servant of Kazgoroth, who killed the previous leader and led them on a rampage against the Ffolk. The Earthmother then guided the hound Canthus, companion of Prince Tristan Kendrick, to kill Erian and lead the Pack in the defense of the Ffolk once more. Under Canthuss leadership, the Pack turned the tide of battle at Caer Corwell, killing many of the Northlander invaders so the Ffolk could rally their defense.\nCategoryOrganizations\nCategoryWolves\nCategoryOrganizations in the Moonshae Isles\nCategoryChauntean organizations\nCategoryOrganizations in the Sea of Swords\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\n2phthbh2z5axm50xe3bhz96w48204g1"
