The '''Drygully Tunnel''' was an entrance to the [[Underdark]] at the edge of the [[High Forest]], less than two-days' marches away from the small village [[Trollbridge]].

While the humans in the area did not know much about the tunnel, the [[drow]] used it regularly for raiding attacks upon the inhabitants of the World Above. The [[human]] berserker [[Fyodor]] used it to escape the Underdark after he learned from [[Liriel Baenre]] of its existence.
