        "mainbody": "The Alignment languages, also known as the Alignment tongues, were nine distinct manners of speaking that each corresponded to each of the nine alignments. Despite the name, they were not full languages, but rather shorthand codes of various words, phrases,\nThe nine alignment languages could only communicate basic things. These included expressing acceptance or disagreement, expressing emotions,\nMost creatures innately possessed one of these alignment tongues, but for most this knowledge was only on a subconscious level. Unusually, alignment tongues were completely absent in the land of Zakhara and they were completely unknown to the korobokuru of Kara-Tur. Those who were conscious of their alignment tongue had at some point \"unlocked\" that self-awareness by recognizing congruity in the speech of those with a like-minded alignment.\nUsually, only those of the corresponding alignment knew and understood alignment tongues,\n* Albruin, a sentient broadsword, was chaotic neutral and knew its associated alignment language.\n* The Cat Lord, while in his human form, was capable of conversing in all of the neutral alignment tongues.\n* All of the original members of the Company of Eight knew an alignment tongue.\n* Deepchill, another sentient broadsword, was lawful neutral and knew its associated alignment language. However, Deepchill would only speak it if absolutely necessary.\n* Sir Emelyn the Gray, a human wizard of lawful good alignment.\n* All of the original members of the Knights of Myth Drannor knew an alignment tongue. This included Dove Falconhand, Florin Falconhand, Islif Lurelake, Jhessail Silvertree, Lanseril Snowmantle, Merith Strongbow, Rathan Thentraver, Sharantyr, and Torm.\n* Li Po, a human cleric or shukenja of lawful good alignment.\n* Lirana, a human cleric of lawful good alignment.\n* Mervic, a human mage of lawful neutral alignment.\n* Niatara, a high elf mage and thief of neutral good alignment.\n* Pwyll Greatshout, the Duke of Daggerford, wielded a sentient flame tongue that knew the lawful tongue.\n* Rairun Blackbrow, a human druid of Silvanus of neutral alignment.\n* The Scales of Justice, a sentient +3 longsword, was neutral good and knew its associated alignment language.\n* Shazzelim, a sentient scimitar, was neutral evil and knew its associated alignment language.\n* Shazzelurt, a sentient dagger, was neutral evil and knew its associated alignment language.\n* Silverleaf, a moon elf mage and thief of chaotic neutral alignment who operated in the city of Ravens Bluff in the 14 century DR.\n* Sylabra, a sentient +3 longsword belonging to Merith Strongbow, was chaotic good and knew its associated alignment language.\n* Thorym, a human fighter of neutral good alignment."
