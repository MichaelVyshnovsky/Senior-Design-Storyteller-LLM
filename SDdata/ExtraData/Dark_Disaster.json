        "mainbody": "'''Dark Disaster''', or the '''Killing Storms''', was a tragedy in {{Yearlink|-10500}} that totally turned the territory of the [[elf|elven]] kingdom of [[Miyeritar]] into a barren wasteland.",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|-11800}}, the largely dark- and wild-[[elf|elven]] nation of [[Miyeritar]] was annexed by the sun-elven nation [[Aryvandaar]] and pacified by {{Yearlink|-11300}}. The Dark Disaster struck {{Yearlink|-10500}} and killed many innocents, though a large number of Miyeritar’s original inhabitants already left for other places.",
        "Culprits": "The Killing Storms weren’t a natural disaster but an artificial one. It is said that [[elven high mage|elven high mages]] on Miyeritar's side accidentally caused the Disaster when they broke a taboo and tried to harness corrupt magic for resistance reasons, which is what the victors in [[Aryvandaar]] wrote in the historical records.<ref> It was actually caused by the high mages from [[Aryvandaar]], who had had [[Miyeritar|Miyeritar’s]] high mages assassinated to drop the nation’s defences against the Killing Storms.",
        "Effects": "The Killing Storms reduced the entire forest and realm into barren wastelands in three months. The scoured land later became known as the [[High Moor]].\n\nFour decades of uneasy peace followed."
