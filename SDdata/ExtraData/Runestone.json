They varied in shape and size, depending on the creator and time they were made. Some runestones even had magic enchantments placed on them.\nThe ancient civilization known as the Adamant Kingdom of Xothaer was home to numerous dwarven scholars. They recorded vast amounts of information on runestones. These records could still be found underneath the Cloud Peaks in various conditions, most shattered, in the 14 century DR.\nAround 1370 DR, the dwarves of Iltkazar were famous makers of runestones.\nRunestones were large slabs of durable stone, usually about an inch thick. They had stories, instructions, and accounts of events carved into one or both of their faces. Runestones were sometimes carved with images or runes in relief, and thus could be used as seals or temporary path markers when pressed into wet mud. Although extremely rare, there were also runestones made of precious metals.\nDwarven runestones were written in the Dethek script. They usually came in diamond or circular shapes. The text started at the edge and spiraled into the center, where an illustration (such as a clan symbol) was usually carved. Due to this, they were read from the outside edge to the center.\nDwarven runestones were also used to mark graves, where an illustration of the dwarf in question would be carved into the center of the stone. Most dwarven runestones were used as maps and clues to hidden hordes of treasure. These stones were some of the most sought-after by greedy adventurers.\n* Delzoun Runestone This runestone was said to explain the whereabouts of the legendary Hammer of Thunderbolts.\n* Thunderholme Runestones These runestones granted access to the ancient city of Thunderholme. Although some were recovered, many were still lost or hidden.\n* Spawn Wars Runestone A fragment of this runestone was discovered several hundred years after it was made. It detailed the events of the Spawn Wars.\n* Rockfire Disaster Runestones In 1374 DR, Cragwarden Samiel Tussin discovered two runestones southwest of Trythosford at Itzcala. The two stones described the events of the Rockfire Disaster of 987 DR.\n* Duergar Runestones This series of runestones explained the history of Clan Duergar. They were discovered in 1383 DR by the crusaders of the Great Rift.\n* Axemarch Stone This huge runestone stood  tall and  wide. It rested on the highest peak of the Marching Mountains, commemorating the dwarven king Aldir Velms leading the dwarves to the mountain range as well as the founding of High High Shanatar. The rune dated this event as \"day 75 of the 492nd year of the founding of House Axemarch\".\nthumb|right|The runestone outside Angelhead Mine.\n* Angelhead Runestone A runestone inscribed with writing of an unknown script and language was found lying amongst the rocks outside the main entrance of Angelhead Mine, wherein ancient ruins were found in 1479 DR.\nCategoryItems\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryDwarven items\nCategoryStone items\nfgtj7x12ts0v1u533dcthr4ftvgtie5"
