The '''Huntsman'''&mdash;as it was called in [[the North]]&mdash;was a constellation visible in [[Faer√ªn]] in the spring. It was known as the '''Hourglass''' in the [[Lands of Intrigue]]. To the [[Tuigan]] of the [[Endless Wastes]], it was the '''Horse-Bowman'''. The group of stars making up the constellation looked something like a lopsided [[hourglass]] with three bright stars at the middle.
