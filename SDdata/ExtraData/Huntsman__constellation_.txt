The Huntsman&mdashas it was called in the North&mdashwas a constellation visible in Faer√ªn in the spring. It was known as the Hourglass in the Lands of Intrigue. To the Tuigan of the Endless Wastes, it was the Horse-Bowman. The group of stars making up the constellation looked something like a lopsided hourglass with three bright stars at the middle.
