        "mainbody": "'''attunement''' was a ritual [[drow]] high ranked within their Houses underwent.",
        "Society": "Drow Houses built defensive wards and traps into their headquarters like ''[[house defense glyph]]s''. The ritual provided a means to safely circumvent these while at the same time ensuring the loyalty of the recipient via a threat.",
        "Procedure": {
            "Curse": "As mentioned above, the recipient of the ritual was the target of a ''bestow curse'' spell. This ritual prevented the recipient from damaging, handing over, or destroying the ''drow house insignia''. On doing one of these thing, the recipient was cursed, usually in the form of a ''[[continual light]]'' effect on the recipient for a number of days depending on the wizard's skill. The ''continual light'' made it difficult for the drow to function properly and made it impossible to hide from detection."
