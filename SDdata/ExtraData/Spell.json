Creatures that had innate supernatural abilities, even those that were related to the Weave, were not spells. Generally, magic-users manipulated the Weave directly to cast arcane spells, whilst priests relied on their deities to cast divine spells.\nSpells, however, could be cast by using magic items, such wands, and could be copied onto scrolls or into spellbooks.\nSomeone who could cast a spell of any kind was known as a spellcaster.\nthumb|right|300px|Yvonnel the Eternal, a skilled spellcaster, glides around Menzoberranzan.\n* Magic missile a very well known basic spell that was developed by General Matick in .\n* Extension I, developed in , was the first Netherese spell ever invented.\n* Karsuss avatar, a spell of immense power that momentarily made a mortal a god.
