'''''Probability travel''''' was a [[psionic]] power of the [[psychoportation]] [[discipline]] that allowed the manifester to travel to other [[plane]]s of reality.

==Effects==
Early records suggested that users of ''probability travel'' were able to cross into other realities, some of them alternative, and some reachable through the [[ethereal plane]]. Novice manifesters were only able to transport themselves, and went off-course about one in five times. With more progress, they became more adept, being able to bring first two people with themselves, and ultimately eight at the peak of their psionic practice.

The earliest records also asserted that, when used at the moment when one was struck by a ''[[sphere of annihilation]]'', this science allowed the manifester to destroy the sphere harmlessly and gain an additional powerâ€”if they survived.

The power could also be used to arrive in the [[astral plane]] bodily, and find one's way to alternate [[Prime Material plane]]s that had color pools in the astral plane.{{cite book/Manual of the Planes 1st edition|61-62}} As there was no projection, no silver cord was manifested, and the risks were commensurate.{{cite dragon/67/The Astral Plane|30}}

Records post-dating the [[Time of Troubles]] referred to powers such as this as unable to access the ethereal plane.{{cite book/A Guide to the Ethereal Plane|36}}

==History==
