This power only worked on willing targets, instantly transferring them to the location with a slight audible pop of sound. Up to three targets could be teleported in this manner at a time. A greater expenditure of psychic energy was needed to teleport targets over greater distances.\n* Vhondryl, a psionicist in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor\nCategoryPsychoportation powers\n9xgcicl3roue95ohnrrckpg9c01c07t"
