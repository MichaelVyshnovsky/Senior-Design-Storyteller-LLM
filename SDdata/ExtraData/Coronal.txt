Coronal was the title of a Faerûnian elven monarch who ruled over a singular elven realm such as ancient Jhyrennstar or Aryvandaar, or an empire such as Cormanthyr. The reign of a Coronal was called a rysar, which began and ended with the rule of the coronal.
A Coronals reign was monarchical and ruled over all. The word of a Coronal was the word of law. Among the elves, a Coronal was considered "speaker among the trees with Corellons voice and bidding". Unlike other monarchs, the inheritance of the position of Coronal was not automatically hereditary, but through chosen heirs. Many saw the position as Coronal as primarily responsible for keeping the people of the realm together and maintaining unity.
The following elven realms were (or may have been) ruled by a Coronal. Those marked as "unknown" lack historical reference for a Coronal, though given their time of existence, it is likely they had such a ruler as all the elven kingdoms of the time and area did.
