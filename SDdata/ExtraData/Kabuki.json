        "mainbody": "abuki was one of the two prevalent forms of theater in the island nation of Wa.\nKabuki productions tended to be vigorous and exciting performances with elaborate song and dance.While not stated directly in the source, in the real world, kabuki plays were usually accompanied by samisen, a stringed instrument. It was forbidden for women to participate in the shows all actors were male.\nKabuki plays tended to be less serious than noh plays, which were the other common theatrical form of Wa. Unlike the epicly long noh performances, a typical kabuki show might only last a couple hours.\nSome of the nobles of Wa found kabuki shows unbecoming or even obscene, such as daimyo Matasuuri Ieysuna, eldest son of the shogun Matasuuri Nagahide. On the other hand, daimyo Matasuuri Unteki, the shoguns brother, not only enjoyed kabuki but also cast himself in the major roles!\nLarge theaters where kabuki shows might be performed included the cities of Uwaji,\n* The Wise Carp by famed playwright Mika Zorrui.\n* The Vulgar Maiden, also by Mika Zorrui."
