It was forbidden for women to participate in the shows; all actors were male.\n\nKabuki plays tended to be less serious than [[noh]] plays, which were the other common theatrical form of Wa. Unlike the epicly long noh performances, a typical kabuki show might only last a couple hours.",

On the other hand, daimyo [[Matasuuri Unteki]], the shogun's brother, not only enjoyed kabuki but also cast himself in the major roles!",
