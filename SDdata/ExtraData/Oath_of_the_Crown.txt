The '''Oath of the Crown''' was one of the sacred vows that [[paladin]]s could choose to take when they reached a milestone in their journey of faith. When they dedicated themselves to the tenets of this oath, they also were granted access to a set of [[spell]]s that they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance.

==Oath of the Crown Spells==
Paladins that had recently taken such as oath could cast ''[[command]]'', ''[[compelled duel]]'', ''[[warding bond]]'', and ''[[zone of truth]]''. Those of more experienced had access to ''[[aura of vitality]]'', ''[[spirit guardians]]'', ''[[banishment]]'', and ''[[guardian of faith]]''. Much more advanced paladins could cast ''[[circle of power]]'' and ''[[geas]]''.
