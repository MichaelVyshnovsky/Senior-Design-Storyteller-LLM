The Oath of the Crown was one of the sacred vows that paladins could choose to take when they reached a milestone in their journey of faith. When they dedicated themselves to the tenets of this oath, they also were granted access to a set of spells that they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance.
Paladins that had recently taken such as oath could cast command, compelled duel, warding bond, and zone of truth. Those of more experienced had access to aura of vitality, spirit guardians, banishment, and guardian of faith. Much more advanced paladins could cast circle of power and geas.
