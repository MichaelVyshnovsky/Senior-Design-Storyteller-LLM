An '''evil node''' was a node that could be magically harnessed by means of [[node magic]].


==Desription==
An evil node generated a magical field that could be harnessed by users of node magic. This field was invisible, but such a location provided a peculiar sight. The area might be enshrouded in a shadowy aura or non-evil people might find the air stale.

The shape of such an energy field had no limitation to it, for example it ignored every kind of physical barrier. This lack of limitation had one exception, the size. An evil node of a particular strength could have only a size within a particular limit. People who wanted to benefit from such a node might put effort in excavation or construction work.

==Reputation==
Evil nodes enjoyed an excellent reputation among evil spellcasters for it allowed them to enhance their [[magic]]. Evil [[outsider]]s and fought from time to time with occupants to wrest away control over one.

==Uses==
An evil node could be used to enhance magic and to gain spells. The spells of an evil node were different from node to node, but followed a pattern. For example, one node granted spells connected to darkness while another one to undeath and so on. Evil people had an easier time to detect an evil node.

A special use of an evil node was the one to imprison people. The stronger the person to be imprisoned was, the stronger the node needed to be. The person to be imprisoned needed to be convinced to be imprisoned. The method by which this agreement was coaxed did not matter. Bribery or even magical charming were viable methods. When imprisoned, the person disappeared and was in a timeless state in which it did not require food or drink and did not age. The person who imprisoned the person could free that person from any evil node, while another person wanting to free the imprisoned needed to go to the exact evil node the person was imprisoned in.
