The Kingdom of Bakar ruled over the valley of the River Athis in the Raurin though all of Raurin was already a desert, the valley was greened by the waters of the magical fountain of Athis. After the fall of the Imaskari, it became ruled by pharaohs, and their people worshiped the Mulhorandi pantheon\nAs the Curse of Amun-Re took effect, the river Athis dried. This slowly led to the depopulation of Terbakar itself, and the other cities along its bed, including Akhir, Pazar, and Phoenix. though they were not within the Lands of Bakar. The curse was lifted in  when adventurers took the Star of Mo-Pelar and the Staff of Ruling from the Pyramid of Amun-Re, though the waters needed years to restore the river to its former level."
