        "History": "Bakar was originally a survivor state of the Imaskari empire. The Kingdom of Bakar ruled over the valley of the [[River Athis]] in the [[Raurin]]; though all of Raurin was already a desert,{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|22}} the valley was greened by the waters of the magical fountain of Athis.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|41}} After the fall of the Imaskari, it became ruled by pharaohs, and their people worshiped the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]]{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|30}}\n\nAs the Curse of Amun-Re took effect, the river Athis dried. This slowly led to the depopulation of Terbakar itself, and the other cities along its bed, including [[Akhir]],{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|109}} [[Pazar]], and [[Phoenix]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|94}} though they were not within the Lands of Bakar.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation/Map}} The curse was lifted in {{yearlink|1356}} when adventurers took the [[Star of Mo-Pelar]] and the [[Staff of Ruling]] from the [[Pyramid of Amun-Re]],<ref name=DoD-p127>{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|127}} though the waters needed years to restore the river to its former level.{{Cite dragon/424/Martek and the Desert of Desolation|17}}"
