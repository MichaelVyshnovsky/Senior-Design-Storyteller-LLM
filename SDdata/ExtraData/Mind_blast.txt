[[File:Mind_blast-5e.jpg|thumb|230px|''A mind flayer using its ''mind blast'' to stun an opponent.'']]
The '''''mind blast''''' was a [[psionic]] ability possessed by [[mind flayer]]s, [[ulitharid]]s, and [[elder brain]]s to neutralize the cognitive abilities and psionic powers of other creatures. Although most frequently used as an offensive ability, mind flayers used low-energy versions of ''mind blasts'' to slowly erode their victims' personality in order to produce more docile thralls.

==Effect==
A typical ''mind blast'' affected all sentient creatures within a {{SIAdj|60|ft}} cone emanating from the mind flayer. Anyone unable to resist suffered damage and was rendered stunned and unable to act for one minute. Mind flayers could also use a version of ''mind blast'' specifically designed to drain the psionic powers of a single target.

A low-power version of ''mind blast'' could be applied to a victim over a period of 24 hours. The effect was the complete destruction of the victim's personality, leaving only a partially empty shell behind that could be easily trained into a perfectly docile thrall to serve the illithid colony's purpose.

==History==
Mind flayers typically used ''mind blasts'' to hunt, dragging off their stunned victims in order to feed on their brains. [[Cerebral hood]]s sometimes lingered around their lairs to overpower the stunned victims of their ''mind blasts'', forcing the creature to be a host, though otherwise cerebral hoods would rely upon their own comparatively weaker ''mind blasts''.<ref name="FF-p216>
