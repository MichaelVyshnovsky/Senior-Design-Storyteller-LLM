        "mainbody": "The Iltarch was one of the seats on the Council of Six, and later the Council of Five, the ruling bodies that governed the nation of Amn during the 14 and 15 centuries DR. By 1479 DR, House Ophal of Crimmor held this seat on the council.\nThe Iltarch of Amn acted as the nations main information-gathering officer. They kept a wide network of spies and freelance counter-intelligence agents to both gather details about the nations rivals and obscure council activities to others. Thanks to the influence of Grandmaster Rhinnom Dannihyr, they had strong ties to the Shadow Thieves, though in the 15 century this bond was kept with House Dannihyr who had ascended to hold the seat of Tessarch.\n* Curkon Gheldieg (1333 DR – 1345 DR)\n* Phaan Colwyvv (1345 DR – 1362 DR)\n* Rhinnom Dannihyr (1362 - ?)"
