Those of such an alignment either disregard any commitment to [[good]], [[evil]], [[law]] and [[chaos]], or believe a balance is needed between these forces in the world.In 4th edition mechanics for ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', neutral is found under the umbrella of the [[unaligned]] alignment.[[File:Lizardfolkkitchen.png|thumb|[[Lizardfolk]], a commonly neutral race.]]",
        "Neutrality": "A neutral person did what seems to be natural to them, without strong feelings with regard to good versus evil or order versus chaos. They were not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.\n\nBeing neutral was the most common alignment of sentient creatures of [[Faer√ªn]] and beyond, as well as the alignment of almost all animals and other creatures of very low intelligence.\n\nSeveral deities that had influence over [[Realmspace]] were of purely neutral alignment. Many of these divine powers focused on either nature or scholarly pursuits. Some examples were [[Silvanus]], [[Oghma]], and [[Dumathoin]].",
        "True Neutrality": "Some that were said to be neutral committed themselves philosophically to neutrality. They were of the ''true neutral'' alignment. They saw good, evil, law and chaos as dangerous, extreme prejudices. They advocated balanced life, carefully maintaining neutrality in the long run.\n\nSome of such an alignment, particularly [[druid]]s, actively supported balance in the world, and sought to avoid being either evil or good. They did not wish that one side would become more powerful over them or anyone else, and would work against whichever side was the most powerful. Those of neutral alignment tended to side with the underdog in any situation, and they were often opportunistic in their actions.",
        "Druids": "Nearly all druids were true neutral. This alignment is central to the philosophy of balance that druids seek. Those that druids sought to protect plants, animals, and the ecological health of [[Toril]], essentially lacked alignment or ethos, and felt free to use almost any means in their protection.\n\nDruidic orders often worked to maintain the natural balance among the alignments. However, many druids realized that most individuals' actions (including their own) will prove significant to the cosmic balance. Druids saw the friction between alignments as the driving force in the world.\n\nSome druidic [[spell]]s of the Realms, such as ''[[word of balance]]'', were able to paralyze or even kill those who were not of neutral alignment.",
