It was the synchronized movement of thousands of dolphins that gave the appearance of a dance.\nthumb|273px\nThe dance occurred at dusk when tens of thousands of dolphins would gather and play a complicated game that onlookers interpreted as a dance.\nSages believe that the dolphins might be communicating with the deity of dolphins, or that they are simply performing some kind of unknown ritual.\nMany believed that viewing the dance on a nightly basis warded off depression and other sicknesses of the mind."
