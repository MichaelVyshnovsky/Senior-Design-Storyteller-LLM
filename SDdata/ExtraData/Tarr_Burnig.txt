Lord Tarr Burnig was a member of the Burnig Cormyrean noble family.
Tarr was a large, musclebound man with a bushy red beard.
Tarr and five other noblemen were part of an informal group who secretly debated the Obarskyr succession and who they should support until they were killed by an unknown assassin in a seedy tavern in Suzail.
