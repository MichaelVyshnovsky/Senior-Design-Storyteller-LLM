A '''huuk''', or "'''singdown'''", was a competition held by [[Iulutiun]]s to settle disagreements.

==Description==
A huuk was a battle of wits; it was essentially an exchange of sung insults between two parties.

==Rules==
An insult was only "valid" if it followed these three "rules":
* It must be sung;
* It must begin with the phrase, "My friend," either in second or third person; and
* It must either compare the opponent to bad food or comment on the opponent's temper.

The competition was played in rounds, with each opponent taking a turn to offer an insult, while the audience listened. A game was played for at least three or four rounds but could go much longer if the two competitors were equally matched.

==Result==
The reaction of the audience determined the winner, and particularly creative or witty insults were preferred. Singdowns were used to resolve minor disputes, so that violence could be avoided.
