A huuk, or "singdown", was a competition held by Iulutiuns to settle disagreements.
A huuk was a battle of wits it was essentially an exchange of sung insults between two parties.
An insult was only "valid" if it followed these three "rules"
* It must be sung
* It must begin with the phrase, "My friend," either in second or third person and
* It must either compare the opponent to bad food or comment on the opponents temper.
The competition was played in rounds, with each opponent taking a turn to offer an insult, while the audience listened. A game was played for at least three or four rounds but could go much longer if the two competitors were equally matched.
The reaction of the audience determined the winner, and particularly creative or witty insults were preferred. Singdowns were used to resolve minor disputes, so that violence could be avoided.
