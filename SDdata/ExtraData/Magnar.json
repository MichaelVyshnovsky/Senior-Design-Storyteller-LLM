        "History": "An ancient spirit of Yuirwood, Magnar was revered by the primitive [[human]] inhabitants of the forest. When the [[wild elves]] settled in Yuirwood in {{Yearlink|-9800}},<ref> the spirits of the forest merged with the [[Seldarine]] and Magnar became an aspect of [[Rillifane Rallathil]] and was almost totally subsumed. Overtime the [[half-elves]] of Yuirwood began referring to Magnar as being in a centuries long state of hibernation, \"Magnar's Great Sleep\". And some would mistakenly conflate Magnar with the primeval spirit [[Bear (spirit)|Bear]] that served Rillifane.<ref>",
        "Trivia": "The [[Temple of the Yuir Gods]] featured a wooden statue of Magnar,<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/Lost Temple of the Fey Gods|21}} and one of the menhirs in the [[Sunglade]] was dedicated to him.<ref>"
