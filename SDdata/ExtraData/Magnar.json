        "mainbody": "agnar the Bear was a primal spirit of the Yuirwood.\nAn ancient spirit of Yuirwood, Magnar was revered by the primitive human inhabitants of the forest. When the wild elves settled in Yuirwood in , the spirits of the forest merged with the Seldarine and Magnar became an aspect of Rillifane Rallathil and was almost totally subsumed. Overtime the half-elves of Yuirwood began referring to Magnar as being in a centuries long state of hibernation, \"Magnars Great Sleep\". And some would mistakenly conflate Magnar with the primeval spirit Bear that served Rillifane.\nThe Temple of the Yuir Gods featured a wooden statue of Magnar, and one of the menhirs in the Sunglade was dedicated to him."
