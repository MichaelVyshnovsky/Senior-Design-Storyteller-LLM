In The Year of Tigers Curse (1374 DR), after the heroic death of Big Chief Bagoomba, witch-doctor Bengoukee sent a group of heroes of the Living Jungle to a shu village of the Jengi tribe. The shu became stricken with a strange hunger disease the tribe needed immediate aid. With help from Blu and Buster, the adventurers met the "Great Spirit" who knew how to concoct a cure. In reality, the "Spirit" was one of a group of jungle doppelganger who wanted to cure the shu for their own reasons. The heroes traveled to the Yaku Plains in search of a special luminescent moss for the cure while being trailed and watched by the doppelgängers in their jungle creatures shape. There, they met a baboon jungle spirit named Rafiki who left the heroes with veiled foreshadowing of the Living Jungles future and guidance to retrieve the moss. Subsequently, the moss was made into a cure that saved the lives of the Jengi tribe.
