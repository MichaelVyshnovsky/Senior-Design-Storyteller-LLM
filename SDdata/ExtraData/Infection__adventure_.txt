{{Quote|''A shu tribe is stricken by a strange disease. The shu are convinced only the healing spirits of the jungle can save them and ask your help in retrieving some rare ingredients. Who knew you would stumble upon a darker secret - one that could mean the death of all shu, everywhere. An adventure for heroes of all levels.''|}}

==Summary==
In The Year of Tigers Curse ([[1374 DR]]), after the heroic death of [[Big Chief Bagoomba]], [[witch-doctor]] [[Bengoukee]] sent a group of heroes of the Living Jungle to a [[shu]] village of the [[Jengi]] tribe. The shu became stricken with a strange hunger disease; the tribe needed immediate aid. With help from [[Blu]] and [[Buster]], the adventurers met the "[[Great Spirit]]" who knew how to concoct a cure. In reality, the "Spirit" was one of a group of [[jungle doppelganger]] who wanted to cure the shu for their own reasons. The heroes traveled to the [[Yaku Plains]] in search of a special luminescent [[moss]] for the cure while being trailed and watched by the doppelgängers in their jungle creatures' shape. There, they met a [[baboon]] jungle spirit named [[Rafiki]] who left the heroes with veiled foreshadowing of the Living Jungle's future and guidance to retrieve the moss. Subsequently, the moss was made into a cure that saved the lives of the Jengi tribe.
