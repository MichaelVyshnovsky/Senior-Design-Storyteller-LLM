[[File:Ruby Rod of Asmodeus.png|thumb|''The Ruby Rod of Asmodeus.'']]
The '''''Ruby Rod of Asmodeus''''' was an [[artifact]].

==Description==
As the name implied, the ''Ruby Rods'' owned by the avatars and aspects looked like a big solid [[ruby]] that was formed into the shape of a [[rod]].{{Cite web enhancement/Fiendish Aspects II|23}} However, the original owned by the Asmodeus' main body was made from a ''[[shard of evil]]'' and merely tipped with a ruby.

These {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} rods had an opaline tip looking like a clawed fist clutching a skull and a jagged bottom that looked like the rod was actually part of something bigger and snapped off from that bigger something. They were covered with good deities' and celestials' names, all spelled in reverse and sullied with black blood.

These rods gave off a soft red light. Upon shooting energy blasts, the rods gave off beams of light in every direction.

==Powers==
One of the easiest ways to use a ''Ruby Rod of Asmodeus'' in combat was to use it as a bludgeon. Used like that, a ''Ruby Rod'' worked like a ''+6 [[unholy]] [[greatclub]]''; or ''[[inflict light wounds]]'' in the ''+1 morningstar'' version. Having Asmodeus' permission to wield a ''Ruby Rod'' allowed a person to wield it without getting hurt.

As mentioned above, ''Ruby Rods'' could shoot energy beams. To be more precise, there were three versions—a 150-foot (45-meter) beam of electricity, a beam of acid that was the same length, or a 75-foot (23-meters) cone of intense cold. The abilities could be used as often as he wanted by Asmodeus but only once per day by other people.

The ''Ruby Rod'' had three protective abilities. One forced people to bow down before the wielder, thereby making it impossible for them to attack the wielder. The second one was about creating a ''[[wall of force]]'' around the wielder as well as a 50-foot (15-meter) radius ''[[antimagic field]]'' that magically repaired the wielder, first by making away with detrimental [[enchantment]] effects, then with mundane detriments like lost body parts that grow back, [[disease]]s, and [[poison]]-induced effects, and at last with a full recovery of the wielder's physical health and magical energy. The last ability could be activated intentionally but did so automatically whenever the wielder fell victim to an enchantment effect. The abilities could be used as often as he wanted by Asmodeus, but only once per day by other people. Third, it could protect the wielder from [[spell]]s by absorbing them into the rod. However, this use of the rod was not unlimited.

==History==
The original ''Ruby Rod of Asmodeus'' was created by Asmodeus from the ''shard of evil'', which he broke off from the bottom of the [[Abyss]] and killed He Who Was, his superior at the time. The crafting of the rod required the ''shard of evil'' and He Who Was' death at the hand of Asmodeus who used the ''Ruby Rod'' for the deed.

According to the play ''[[The Trial of Asmodeus]]'', which was allegedly based on facts, Asmodeus was obliged to always carry the ''Ruby Rod of Asmodeus'' by [[Primus]]. The rod would act both as a symbol for him and his [[devil]]s' right to forge pacts with mortals and as a punishment device for all devils that do not respect the strictures of their bargains.

==Reputation==
Every avatar of Asmodeus carried a ''Ruby Rod of Asmodeus'' as a symbol of the office Asmodeus held, which was the one as overlord of [[Baator]] and as the one to whom all devils had to obey.

==Notable Owners==
All [[avatar]]s of [[Asmodeus]] owned a ''Ruby Rod of Asmodeus,'' as did [[aspect]]s of [[aspect of Asmodeus|his]]—at least they owned some downgraded version of it.{{Cite web enhancement/Fiendish Aspects II}}

Sometimes, Asmodeus gave a ''Ruby Rod'' to somebody else. However, it was never known if what he gave was a replica or the genuine thing.
