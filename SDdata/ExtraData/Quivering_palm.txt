'''Quivering palm''' was an ability possessed by [[monk]]s.<ref>

It was a spell or incantation used by [[Kane]] for dominating enemies. The spell was enhanced by a magical item, such as a ring, and activated through meditative incantation. A spectral hand would appear next to the subject, lightly brushing him or her. Though the subject didn't feel different, the monk could then control the subject's body and emit pain and paralysis at will.

Its effect were not permanent and wore away after a certain amount of time but the spells effects could be released on will by the enacting monk as well.
