        "mainbody": "'''High Mage of Silverymoon''', or '''High Lady Mage''' in its feminine form, was the title afforded to the ruler of the [[Northwest Faerûn|northern]] city of [[Silverymoon]]. The capable [[wizard]] chosen for the position was, in most cases, either elected by the Silvaeren themselves or named by the preceding High Mage as their chosen successor, and customarily carried with them a unique ''[[staff of Silverymoon]]'' as proof of their sovereignty.\n{{Quote|All that I ask you to understand is that, as leader of my city, I am forced at times to act for the overall good, whatever the cost to [[Drizzt Do'Urden|an individual]].|Alustriel Silverhand, one High Mage of Silverymoon, apologizing to a humble [[drow]] [[ranger]] for the difficult decision she made.}}",
        "Home": "Traditionally, the High Mage ruled from the [[High Palace]], to the city's eastern front. This magically warded fortress held their chambers, the [[Silver Throne]], and, later, [[Moon Seat]], upon which they sat, as well as much more at their disposal. This included, for those High Mages who died with the Silvaeren's respects (and did not leave or disappear upon retirement), the [[Crypt of the High Mages]], where they would be interred by having their bodies turned to stone whilst still clutching their staves.",
        "The High Mages": {
            "[[637 DR]] – [[712 DR]]": ": [[Ecamane Truesilver]]: The first of Silverymoon's elected High Mages, and the first to start it on the path to becoming a sister city to fabled [[Myth Drannor]].",
            "712 DR – [[719 DR]]": ": [[Aglanthol|Aglanthol the Red]]: Given the position by his great-uncle and teacher, he created the first ''staff of Silverymoon'' and ruled through the culmination of [[Weeping War|Myth Drannor's fall]].",
            "719 DR – [[784 DR]]": ": [[Ederan Nharimlur]]: Known as Catseye, his reign was mostly peaceful—the only notable exception being the theft of [[Staff of Silverymoon#Notable Staffs of Silverymoon|his ''staff'']] by [[Brotherhood of the Black Hand|Brothers of the Black Hand]].",
            "784 DR – [[857 DR]]": ": [[Amaara Nharimlur]]: The daughter of her predecessor, she oversaw the creation of some of Silverymoon's most famous landmarks, including the [[Moonbridge]].",
            "857 DR – [[876 DR]]": ": [[Alustriel Silverhand#Time as Elué Dualen|Elué Dualen]]: Given the title by Amaara Nharimlur after decades of friendship, her sudden disappearance marked the first disruption in the rule of Silverymoon's High Mages.",
            "[[877 DR]] – [[882 DR]]": ": [[Tanalanthara Mytersaal]]: Commended as the Protectress, she put an end to Lashtor's life and to Silverymoon's darkest year, living to see the creation of foul [[Hellgate Keep]], until she gave the ultimate sacrifice for her city.",
            "[[883 DR]] – [[920 DR]]": ": [[Tanisell|Tanisell the Cloaked]]: Many refugees escaped to Silverymoon during the Cloaked Lord's years, forcing him to expand the city, for the first time, onto the [[River Rauvin]]'s southern bank.",
            "920 DR – [[1050 DR]]": ": [[Nunivytt Threskaal]]: Friend and confidant to his predecessor, his rulership was longer than that of any High Mage prior, coming to be known as a learned and peaceful golden age.",
            "1050 DR – [[1230 DR]]": ": [[Orjalun]]: Taught magic by Threskaal since childhood, he was a natural choice as successor, seeing Silverymoon through further southern expansion and a terrible plague.",
            "1230 DR – [[1232 DR]]": ": [[Sepur]]: The tenth High Mage, though named directly by Orjalun, soon deserted the city. The ensuing power vacuum caused [[Spellsfall]], the destructive fighting of 25 of the city's wizards, and the subsequent election of [[Silvermayor]] [[Theomel Scalson]].",
            "[[1235 DR]] – 1235 DR": ": [[Shaloss Ethenfrost]]: The only High Mage to steal the title, after wresting control of Silverymoon from [[Khallos Shieldsunder|another tyrannical Warlord]], he ruled over the city, as it was besieged by [[orc]]s, for only two months.",
            "1235 DR – [[1369 DR]]": ": [[Alustriel Silverhand]]: The first High Mage to be elected by the Silvaeren unanimously, for her rescue of the city, she would also become the first to retire from the position into a higher one: ruler of [[Luruar|an entire confederation of cities]].",
            "1369 DR – 1480s [[DR]]": ": [[Taern Hornblade]]: Named High Mage in Alustriel's wake, sometime soon before [[1489 DR]].",
            "1480s DR –": ": [[Methrammar Aerasumé]]: One of Alustriel's [[Tall Ones|twelve sons]], he only received the right to rule his home city after the dissolution of Luruar."
