Teleport was a psionic science of the psychoportation discipline that allowed the psionicist to instantly travel to a safe location.
The safe location needed to be a place the psionicist knew and was familiar with. This could work even with a place the psionicist had only seen with their mind by using other psionic powers. A psionicist was able to teleport even if gagged or restrained, so long as they were conscious. A slight audible popping noise occurred when the psionicist disappeared and reappeared during the teleportation. The psionicist could choose to expend more psychic energy in order to teleport their equipment, or any companions they can grab, up to three times their body mass. Longer distances also required an expenditure of more psychic energy.
