This species was endemic to the lands of Chult and Tashalar\n Piranha ant  A species of  long ants that could group together in thousands in order to strip flesh from living beings.\n Red ant  Otherwise known as fire ants, this species could be found in the rimwood area of the forest of Cormanthor and in the Raurin desert.\nLarge swarms of ants could be found in the Crowded Sea region, on the island of Djinnis Claws.\nLike most mundane animals, ants could be found in the Beastlands.\nThe humans and wild dwarves that inhabited the lands of Chult and Tashlar were known to harvest and eat honey ants, except for during the winter season.\nIn the land of Semphar, people were known to harvest large quantities of ants, douse them in herbed oils, and then fry them into a sort of cake. The oil made it so that the ants would stick together into an easily movable mass. This custom was practiced during all but the winter season."
