        "mainbody": "Geomancy was a system of magic based upon the study of the element of earth. This magic was used almost exclusively in Zakhara, the Land of Fate, specifically in the ancient kingdom of Kadar.\nThis form of magic was used specifically by special wizards and priests of Grumbar in Zakhara, specifically the Cities of the Ancients region, called Geomancers. Geomancers could be individuals who strictly practiced either arcane or divine magic, but the most powerful geomancers known to history were those who practiced both forms of magic.\nThe Geomancers used their magic to understand and interpret Fate. Their unique holistic philosophy combined both arcane and divine magic to create extremely powerful runes called geoglyphs."
