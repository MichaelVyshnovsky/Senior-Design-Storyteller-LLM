Spellsong was the ability to invoke various magical effects through song and music.
Practitioners of spellsong were known as spellsingers and were individuals who had the innate ability to use their voice to produce melodies with magical properties. Training could only refine this ability. Spellsingers were mostly female humans and half-elves.
The process of using this art consisted of singing and dancing alone or with other spellsingers, usually around a focus or a creature intended to receive the effects of the magic.
Spellsingers could use their art to work a variety of magical effects, but the song of a single caster was not very powerful and could create magic whose power was comparable to cantrips or orisons. Multiple spellsingers could dance and sing in coordination to perform rituals capable of working more powerful magic, like healing wounded or ill creatures located near the casters (albeit generally not with the same power of major healing spells) sending simple messages, visions or indications to individuals known to the majority of the casters repelling undead or evil creatures and making magic items glow, activate or levitate.
Particularly powerful spellsingers had the ability to use their song to call upon the Weave, invoking spells similar in power to those of a wizard or sorcerer.
