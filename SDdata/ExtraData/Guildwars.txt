The '''Guildwars''' were a series of conflicts within the city of [[Waterdeep]], between the years [[1256 DR]] and [[1262 DR]]. These years would see the deaths of all the known [[Lords of Waterdeep|Lords of the city]], and the emergence of the [[Council of Guildmasters]] rise to power, which lasted until [[1273 DR|1273]].

With an unsteady truce, the fighting and selfish bickering continued for six years of shared rule. However, in [[1262 DR]], the troubles brewing beneath the surface came to a boil in the form of total bloodshed. All but two of the guildmasters were killed; only [[Ehlemm Zoar]] of the [[Gemcutters guild (Waterdeep)|Gemcutters guild]] and [[Lhorar Gildeggh]] of the [[Shipwrights guild (Waterdeep)|Shipwrights guild]] were left alive. Exhausted from years of backstabbing, violence and death, the two remaining guildmasters agreed to rule together as Lords Magister,
