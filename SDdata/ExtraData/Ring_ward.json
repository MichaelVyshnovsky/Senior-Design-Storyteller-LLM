It was the weakest of three standard types of wards employed by the king. Like each of the three standard wards, the actual spell to prepare the ward was a carefully guarded state secret, though it was similar to the spell known as wardmist.\nA ring ward would apply a weak electrical shock to any person not bearing a Purple Dragon ring. The shock was strong enough to turn away various animals as well. In addition, any such unauthorized creature would trigger a light or sound alarm.\nThe ward also inhibited the casting of weaker spells in the vicinity.\nThe palace in the city of Arabel had several floors protected by ring wards, as did the gates of Oldstone Hall in Wheloon.\n* Cloak ward\n* Dragon ward\n* Full ward\nCategoryMagic wards\nCategoryMagic\nCategoryYear of Metropolises\nil5vfqrsmz21kvmecglfiosrywhhdee"
