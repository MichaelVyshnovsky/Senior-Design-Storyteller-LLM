        "Description": "Blades were specifically used to cut and slice. Such items were hand-held slashing weapons made of [[metal]] or other rigid material. Specifically for blades, the cutting edge made up most of the length of the weapon, unlike [[axe]]s and [[pole arm]]s, where the cutting edge was much shorter than the overall length. As such, examples of blades were [[sword]]s ([[shortsword|short]] or [[longsword|long]]), [[dagger]]s (very short, double edged), and [[knife|knives]] (very short, single edged)."
