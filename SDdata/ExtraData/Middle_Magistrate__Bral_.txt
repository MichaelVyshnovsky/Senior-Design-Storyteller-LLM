The '''Middle Magistrate''' was one of the three magistrates of the city of [[Bral]] on the [[Rock of Bral]] in [[Realmspace]].

Whenever a serious crime occurred in Middle City—most minor crime in Bral was either ignored or tolerated—one would report to the Middle Magistrate or a representative, who would then decide if an investigation and/or arrest were warranted. In general, the magistrates did not like to be bothered.

==Base of Operations==
The Middle Magistrate was based out of a [[Offices of the Middle Magistrate|complex of buildings]] in the Middle City.

==Notable Middle Magistrates==
During the reign of Prince [[Andru]], toward the end of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Middle Magistrate was Lady [[Terissa Ketal]], who was thought of as a "jettisoning judge" because of her tendency to sentence criminals to execution.
