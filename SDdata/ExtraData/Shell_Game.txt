The '''shell game''' was a standard con practiced by [[thieves]], most often those who specialized as being [[swindler]]s, that was passed off as being a game of chance that relied upon a user's power of observation.

==Description==
This con involved three shells, with one covering a small object, such as a [[clay]] [[pea]]. The small object would be covered in front of the player, then the shells would have their positions quickly shifted around. Once the shifting was done, the player had to identify which of the shells was the one covering the small object. Guessing correctly would win one [[coin]]s, while guessing wrong would lose that money to the operator of the shell game. The trick of this game was that thieves would use their skills in sleight-of-hand to remove the small object during the shifting process, thus ensuring that it was impossible for a player to guess correctly.

Sometimes players would be allowed to win on their first go, so as to build up their confidence, while at other times the shell man would have an accomplice in the crowd that would be allowed to win so as to draw victims in.

==Availability==
''[[Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue (in-universe)|Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue]]'' sold shells with roller pockets within its "Thieves' Corner" section for the price of 3 [[gp]].<ref>

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], outside of the streets, one could find the shell game being offered in [[Ravens Bluff]] among various other games of chance in the [[House of Thud]] gambling hall.{{Cite organized play/LC/Luck Takes a Vacation|6}} And beyond [[Toril]], in the city of [[Bral]] one could find many booths offering the shell game within its [[Thieves' Market]].<ref>
