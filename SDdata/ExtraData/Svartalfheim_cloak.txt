Svartalfheim cloaks were magical cloaks from the realm of Svartalfheim.
These cloaks were black and blue in coloration, made of a light material, and had a fur collar.
These cloaks granted their wearers increased powers of stealth, on par with that of a cloak of elvenkind, and granted the power to cast wraithform once per day.
In the , a group of adventurers from the city of Ravens Bluff on the world of Toril traveled to Ysgard in search of the legendary Well of Mimir. While on their journey they came into the possession of one of these cloaks. Other sources told of the Ravenians having broken into Brimirs hall and stolen the cloak from his bedroom or having won a Svartalfheim cloak from Queen Titania for having competed against fey of the Seelie Court in a series of challenges.
