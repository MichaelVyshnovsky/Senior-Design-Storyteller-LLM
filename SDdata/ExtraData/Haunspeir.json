        "mainbody": "Haunspeir''' was a [[drug]] that served as a mental stimulant. It was popular among [[mage]]s and other [[ arcane spellcaster]]s, and was in fact named after a [[wizard]] from [[Neverwinter]].",
        "Description": "In its consumable form, haunspeir was processed into a paste that resembled [[tobacco]] or, on occasion, dried and pressed into a swallowable tablet.",
        "Effects": "When taken, the drug significantly increased the intellect of the user for a short duration, a matter of minutes. It had the side effect of making an individual more prone to harm from physical attacks that pierced or cut open the flesh.\n\nIf more than one dose was taken within 24 hours, the user was immediately harmed and became twice as susceptible to further damaging effects."
