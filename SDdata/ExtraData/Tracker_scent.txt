The '''tracker scent''' ritual was used by [[sha'ir]]s to enhance the sense of smell of their [[gen]].

==Preparation==
A concoction of rare [[herb]]s costing 600 [[dinar]]s was needed to complete the tracker scent ritual. This ritual took 16 hours to complete.

Gens with tracker scent were able to track any creature by their scent providing the creature traveled by land.
