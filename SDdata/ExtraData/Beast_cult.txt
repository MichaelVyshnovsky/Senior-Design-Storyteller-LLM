Beast cult was a term used to refer to a variety of different, less organized or "primitive" belief systems in the Realms. A more archaic term for referring to such groups in the plural was Cults of the Beast.
Some beast cults worshiped certain animal-related deities, typically on the level of demipowers or lesser powers, such as Lurue the Unicorn Queen and Nobanion the King of Beasts. Such groups could be divided into benevolent and malevolent cults.
Others worshiped living monsters or mundane animals, considering them to be emissaries of the gods, the embodiments of divine wrath, or a "perfect form" of their species. Some for example worshiped dragons, especially in the ancient days of Toril, considering them to be truly divine creatures. Those who believed the creature they worshiped was the "perfect form" of their species, viewed it as the leader or master of all others in their species.
The dress and practices of beast cults varied significantly from location to location and from the beast or deity worshiped. Though in northwest Faerûn, totems were a typical aspect of beast cults.
Benevolent beast cults tended to try living in harmony with nature, cherishing and praising the nobility of their patron, while malevolent cults tended to revel in bloodlust, brutality, and savagery.
The type of powers that a beast cult cleric received varied with the cult, but there were some commonalities. Such clerics typically received access to the animal sphere, as well as either the charm, combat, plant, or weather sphere. They also could shapechange into the type of creature they worshiped and had access to spells that would summon creatures of that type.
Besides clerics, beast cults that venerated magical beasts were known to harbor totemists, shamans who learned to shape the spiritual energy associated with their beast into magical effects.
Beast cults often attracted nomads, evil humanoids, and individuals that were removed from the normal circles of civilized society. Such people typically did their best to keep their activities and cult a secret, especially in urban areas. Performing their religious rites and sacrifices covertly.
Beast cults were also quite common in tribal cultures.
