The game was said to be similar to [[Chess (game)|chess]], where dragons schemed against their fellow players through their minions and even unwilling agents to advance their goals and earn prestige.",
        "Background": "As dragons were usually solitary creatures, ''xorvintaal'' was one of the few ways an individual dragon could earn prestige among their kind. Those who mastered ''xorvintaal'' were regarded as among the finest minds dragonkind had to offer. Despite this, only few dragons devoted their lives to the game as it demanded a great commitment from its players. Most of those who became interested in ''xorvintaal'' did so when they were young, attracted by the allure of besting their fellows and the promise of vast treasure. \n\nUsually, the new players were introduced to the game and tutored by older, more experienced players, giving the game a feudal element. These older players earned a share of their younger protégées' hoard as well as renown if these new players became successful\n\nOnly dragons could understand the finer points of the rules of ''xorvintaal'', \n\nBecause of that draconic point of view, the rules were difficult to grasp for non-dragon creatures, such as [[human]]s. The knowledge humans had from the ''xorvintaal'' was usually contradictory and not even close to the actual rules of the game. At least one book, ''[[A History of Draconic Interactions]]'', made the ''xorvintaal'' look as if was a game of dragons trying to outwit their rivals and kill each other, and that the governments of many nations, the priesthoods of many [[god]]s, and even shadowy organizations were all involved somehow with the dragon players. According to [[Clytemorrenestrix]], the book not only was wrong about the rules, but it actually made the game look illogical, at least from the perspective of dragons.",
        "History": {
            "Ancient History": "During the [[Time of Dragons]], wyrms of the age feared that if dragons continued battling each other, as they had since their race was born, they would eventually face extinction. In time, they came up with a solution: Instead of battling each other, dominance among them would be established by status. To determine this, they developed the ''xorvintaal''. After the first [[Rage of Dragons]], however, dragons lost knowledge of the game.\n\nIn the world of [[Abeir]], the ''xorvintaal'' was also known and played by the dragons native to that world. The city of [[Xorvintroth]] was named after the game.{{Cite adventurers league/Volatile Thoughts|2}}",
            "Modern History": "The [[vampire|vampiric]] [[smoke drake]] Brimstone claimed that he rediscovered the game's rules in the ruins where [[Sammaster]] was killed after the last Rage of Dragons, in [[1373 DR]].\n\nBrimstone brought the rules of ''xorvintaal'' to [[Dracowyr]] in [[Murghôm]] in [[1478 DR]], convincing many [[chromatic dragon]]s and a few [[gem dragon|gem]] and [[metallic dragon|metallic dragons]] to participate. Setting himself up as the referee and scorekeeper, [[Brimstone's Xorvintaal|Brimstone's ''xorvintaal'']] was dedicated to the goddess [[Tiamat]]. To ensure the dragons would play, Brimstone bound them with a powerful [[spell]], although the participants were unaware of this.\n\nThe ultimate goals of Brimstone's ''xorvintaal'' were to determine who became the emperor of dragonkind and to dominate all the nations in the [[Alamber Sea]] vicinity. [[Tymanther]], due to its hatred of dragons, was considered the most dangerous nation in the game, and many players aimed to either subjugate or destroy it in order to quickly rack up massive amounts of points.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Luthcheq]], [[Tchazzar]]'s death and Alasklerbanbastos' destruction, the leaders of the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]], as well as several dragon [[princes of Murghôm]] and [[dragonborn]] knights from Tymanther, traveled to Dracowyr, on [[Nightal]] of [[1479 DR]], to confront Brimstone and forced him to cancel the magic that bound wyrms to the game. Brimstone claimed that the game was just a ruse to allow him to eliminate the most powerful dragons around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Even after Brimstone canceled the spell, nobody could be sure if the ''taaldaraxi'' would stop playing.\n\nThat same year, the [[green dragon]] [[Andareunarthex]] was playing its own ''xorvintaal'' game in [[Waterdeep]], but his schemes were stopped by the former-[[blue dragon]] Clytemorrenestrix and her companion [[Tennora Hedare]]."
