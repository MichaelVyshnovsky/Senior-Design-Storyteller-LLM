Capable of distinguishing colors, shapes, and even the relative position of objects. This was because Toril and many other planets were continually bombarded by ultraviolet radiation from stars and other celestial objects. In these conditions, creatures could see clearly out to . Beyond that and up to  away a creature could see things only dimly. On particularly cloudy nights, this visible range was reduced by half. \nAs earth and stone screened out that radiation, this vision was of little use inside subterranean locations unless there were some form of ultravisual emanation. but would function in the Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane.\nWhen underwater, the visible range for a creature with ultravision was typically half that of their land range. At ocean depths below  nothing could be seen, for ultraviolet light did not penetrate beyond that depth in sufficient quantities.\nSpells and enchanted weapons that shed illumination typically would hamper this vision.\nSeveral creatures were either known or believed to have the ability of seeing the world through ultravision. Some notable ones were\n* The angels known as planetars and solars.\n* The sprites known as atomies and grigs.\n* Daemons.\n* Derros.\n* Dragon horses.\n* Green hags.\n* Gripplis.\n* Gulguthras.\n* Hordlings.\n* Kuo-toas.\n* The modrons known as pentadrones, quadrones, and tridrones.\n* Peches.\n* Phoenixes.\n* Owls.\n* Vargouilles.\n* There were a variety of magical items that could bestow ultravision upon a creature. These included the Eye of Vecna, the robe of eyes, the lens of ultravision, the staff of night, the dark crown, the magemask, and the catstaff.\n* Darkvision\nCategoryCreature special abilities\ndyg9neyuhbzbsu1apernrpo4yn5bolx"
