In the [[Zakhara]]n view of [[magic]], the '''universal province''' encompassed a number of spells that were not specific to the four elemental provinces of [[sand (province)|sand]], [[sea (province)|sea]], [[wind (province)|wind]], and [[flame (province)|flame]]. Universal spells could be learned by all Zakharan [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]] and [[elemental mage]]s, no matter their specialization. The universal province is not to be confused with the much narrower range of [[universal spell]]s that were not considered part of any of the nine (or eight) [[schools of magic]] distinguished by [[Faer√ªn]]ian magic-users.
