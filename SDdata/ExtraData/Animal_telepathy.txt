Animal telepathy was a minor psionic devotion that allowed a psionicist to telepathically communicate with various broad ranges of living creatures. Some might refer to it as being a more limited version of mindlink.Though this power was never formally updated for 2 edition AD&D, it was sporadically mentioned in some sources. Encyclopedia Magica Volume IIs description of discipline requirements for an item originally published in Dragon #91 (page 540), Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Fours entry on the brain coral creature that was originally published in Dragon #116, and in Polyhedron #49s "The Living City The For-Rest Inn" (page 29). Of these three, Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Four addresses the power in relation to 2 edition psionics, referring to it as a limitation on the brain corals use of the devotion mindlink.
The types of living things that could be communicated with through animal telepathy, as well as powers operational range and the range at which creatures could be searched for, depended upon the possessing psionicists degree of mastery with the devotion and their psionic powers as a whole. It offered psionicists no greater ability to command or influence the minds of such creatures. The devotion operated as follows
* Gypsy psionicists often learned this devotion.
* Baku, a powerful psionic race, innately possessed a 12 degree mastery of animal telepathy.
* Brain coral, an intelligent and psionic range of coral, innately possessed a 9 degree mastery of animal telepathy.
* Planetars, one of the orders of angels in the multiverse, innately possessed a 14 degree mastery of animal telepathy.
* Solars, another order of angels in the multiverse, innately possessed a 4 degree mastery of animal telepathy.
* Elrem the Wise, a powerful Uthgar shaman of the Great Worm tribe.The North Guide to the Savage Frontier and Powers & Pantheons both state that the "great worm" form an Uthgar shaman can shapechange into confers a number of psionic powers. The powers listed are nearly the same as those that were originally detailed for Elrem back in The Savage Frontier, thus it can be inferred that Elrems psionic powers are not unique to him. The only power absent in both sources is animal telepathy. This is presumably due to it not having made the transition from 1 to 2 edition AD&D, rather than it being unique to Elrem in any way. Therefore, it can be further inferred that animal telepathy is likewise a power this "great worm" form confers.
