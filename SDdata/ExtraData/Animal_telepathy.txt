'''''Animal telepathy''''' was a minor [[psionic]] devotion that allowed a [[psionicist]] to telepathically communicate with various broad ranges of living creatures. Some might refer to it as being a more limited version of ''[[mindlink]]''.<ref group="note" name="power">Though this power was never formally updated for 2{{nd}} edition [[AD&D]], it was sporadically mentioned in some sources. ''[[Encyclopedia Magica Volume II]]'s'' description of discipline requirements for an item originally published in [[Dragon magazine 91|''Dragon'' #91]] (page 540), ''[[Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Four]]'''s entry on the brain coral creature that was originally published in [[Dragon magazine 116|''Dragon'' #116]], and in [[Polyhedron 49|''Polyhedron'' #49]]'s "The Living City: The For-Rest Inn" (page 29). Of these three, ''Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Four'' addresses the power in relation to 2{{nd}} edition psionics, referring to it as a limitation on the brain corals' use of the devotion ''[[mindlink]]''.

==Effects==
The types of living things that could be communicated with through ''animal telepathy'', as well as power's operational range and the range at which creatures could be searched for, depended upon the possessing psionicist's degree of mastery with the devotion and their psionic powers as a whole. It offered psionicists no greater ability to command or influence the minds of such creatures. The devotion operated as follows:

===Individuals===
* [[Elrem|Elrem the Wise]], a powerful [[Uthgar]] [[shaman]] of the [[Great Worm tribe]].<ref group="note" name="shaman">''[[The North: Guide to the Savage Frontier]]'' and ''[[Powers & Pantheons]]'' both state that the "great worm" form an Uthgar shaman can [[wild shape|shapechange]] into confers a number of psionic powers. The powers listed are nearly the same as those that were originally detailed for Elrem back in ''[[The Savage Frontier]]'', thus it can be inferred that Elrem's psionic powers are not unique to him. The only power absent in both sources is ''animal telepathy''. This is presumably due to it not having made the transition from 1{{st}} to 2{{nd}} edition AD&D, rather than it being unique to Elrem in any way. Therefore, it can be further inferred that ''animal telepathy'' is likewise a power this "great worm" form confers.
