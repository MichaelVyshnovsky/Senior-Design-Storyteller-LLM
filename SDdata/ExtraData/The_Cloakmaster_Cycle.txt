{{DEFAULTSORT:Cloakmaster Cycle, The}}
'''The Cloakmaster Cycle''' is a series of six novels written by multiple authors and published by [[TSR, Inc.]] between 1991 and 1993. The novels are part of the [[Spelljammer Campaign Setting]], but several of them feature settings and characters from the [[Forgotten Realms]] setting, and the second book in the series, ''[[Into the Void]]'', was officially considered a crossover novel and included the Forgotten Realms logo.

The series tells the story of a farmer from the planet [[Krynn]], [[Teldin Moore]], who obtains a [[Cloak of the First Pilot]] of the [[Spelljammer (spelljammer)|''Spelljammer'']] and seeks to understand its powers and find the great ship of legend. The novels take place during the [[Second Unhuman War]] during the early 1360s [[DR]].
