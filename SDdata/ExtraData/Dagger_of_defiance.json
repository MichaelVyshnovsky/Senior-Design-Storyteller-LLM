        "mainbody": "dagger of defiance is a magical dagger, first created in Myth Drannor, that grants the wielder an immunity to fear and repulsion, and enables the wielder to more easily resist the effects of enchantments, charms, polymorphs and petrification.\nSuch a weapon requires a standard dagger, doppelganger blood, distilled essence of xorn flesh, and the casting of fear and repulsion spells.\nAs of 1368 DR, the value of such a dagger was around 1,000 gold pieces. By 1372 DR, this was around 12,000 gold pieces.\nFRDague de d√©fiance\nCategoryDaggers\nCategoryItems from Myth Drannor\nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryPlus-1 items\nCategory1000-1499 gold pieces\nCategory10000-14999 gold pieces\nCategoryMagic weapons\nCategoryLight weapons\nCategoryLight blades\nCategorySimple weapons\nCategoryPiercing weapons\nCategorySlashing weapons\nCategoryThrown weapons\nCategoryRanged weapons\n90gkxrj8bdy3yyvchp04i38eo79o2s2"
