            "Bounty Hunters": "{{fq\n| text = Adventuring! A fine and glorious pastime that passes time like no other! To seek the rights and lows of the depths and heights; to follow in the footsteps leading down paths never trod upon; to plumb the furthest reaches of oneself while exploring the very world just outside your door. Such a life is a grand one indeed, though simple in its complexity!\n| source = [[Reginald \"Longtooth\" Worthington III]]\n| float =\n| width =\n}}\nAn alternative for adventurers looking for making a name for themselves was to work as [[bounty hunter]]s, dealing with bandits, wanted criminals and adventurers declared outlaws by local authorities. Bounty hunters always attempted to bring back criminals or stolen property to the authorities and the wronged people, or at least eliminate the outlaws and so \"repay the debt in blood before the gods.\"\n\nAlthough initially people mistrusted bounty hunters, this public attitude toward them began to change in [[1400 DR]], when the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] issued a decree known as the [[Tarnsmoke Proclamation]], by which it became legal in Waterdeep and its patrolled environs to hire bounty hunters (most of them usually adventurers) to go after wanted outlaws. This practice became very popular over the next decade, and by [[1480 DR]] it was legal in most places along the [[Sword Coast]], though frowned upon by many faiths.",
            "Self-styled Nobility": "Many ambitious adventurers usually set themselves up as nobility by conquering a region and declaring it a realm. This was something common in places like the [[Border Kingdoms]]. This was the usual sort of way that adventurers become noble, aside from marrying someone from nobility. This was a dangerous course of action, however, as many of those would-be nobles usually ended up dead, killed by legitimate nobles who wanted them out of the way (usually, their spouses).",
            "Odd Jobs": "[[File:Treasure Chest AFR.jpg|thumb|left|A team of adventurers and a treasure chest.]]\nAdventurers were usually hired to fulfill certain \"odd jobs\". Such odd jobs included grave-digging (or grave-robbing), animal training and monster capturing, working in sewers (a popular unpleasant yet well-paid job in places like Waterdeep,), and stonemasonry concerned with fortifications and manors (such as repairs, painting and decoration, among other similar activities). In places such as Cormyr and [[Amn]], government agents also paid adventurers to dispose off of garbage, dung and other disposable stuff.\n\nIn [[Calimshan]], as satraps wanted to avoid civil war, they hired adventurers to be their \"staff adventurers\". \"Staff adventurers\" were pitted against the \"staff adventurers\" of another satraps when two or more satraps wanted to resolve a disagreement. Likewise, some nobles and wealthy merchants liked to hire [[bard]]s to script pretend disputes, which adventurers on both sides acting specific roles complete with moonlit raids, swordplay along balconies, thrilling chases, and grand confrontations. It was a lucrative workâ€”and a few adventurers even liked it.\n[[File:Shovel and pouch.png|thumb|''Adventurers' best friends: a shovel for digging treasures up, and a pouch to carry them.'']]\nAnother lesser-known line of work that was popular among adventurers was to sell their services as scribes that posed as their patrons, writing on their behalf and keeping both the writing task and the contents of what was written utterly secret. Such adventurers were hired to write love letters, job applications, and delicate apologies on behalf of wealthy patrons. Bards and nobles liked to hire such adventurers to compose jokes, speeches and songs they could later claim as their own.\n\nA variant on this kind of work (believed to have been originated in Cormyr) was to write \"heartwarms\" (flowery romance) and \"lust tales\" (mature-rated tales), intended for the eyes of the patron only and sometimes written to order, using real individuals as characters.\n\nA few adventurers (usually those disabled by age or injury in ways that limited the professions\nthey could undertake) became so desperate or uncaring enough as to went as far as to sell their own bodies to [[wizard]]s and [[alchemist]]s to be experimented upon.",
            "Adventuring Companies": "[[File:Wp1char 1024x768.jpg|thumb|right|330px|''Adventurers planning their next move.'']]\nAdventuring companies, also known as adventuring bands,\n\nAdventuring bands could forge an interesting career as \"finders and disposers\" for [[archmage]]s, a royal court, or wealthy individuals. Some people hired adventuring bands, especially well-known and/or veteran bands, to find works of written word (such as [[:Category:Books (in-universe)|books]] and [[scroll]]s), a job that in the Realms was very expensive, while followers of [[Mystra]] usually used such bands to \"uncover\" the [[magic item]]s they had left behind in ruins, caves and other such places, following the edicts of their goddess.\n\nSome adventuring bands also become independent [[Moneylending|moneylenders]].",
            "Older adventurers": "[[File:Dead adventurer.png|thumb|''An unlucky adventurer who did not survive a [[descent to Undermountain]].'']]\nFew adventurers survived to see old age, because of the risks of their profession as well as for some of them it was like an unspoken tradition to chose to not reach to such an age. Adventurers who respected this traditions usually went to dangerous places searching for an heroic death or started random fights they knew they could not win.\n\nThose few adventurers that survived to see retirement usually sold their services training younger adventurers or giving them advise and information (such as old maps and rumors about places with potential treasure). Such adventurers also frequented taverns to tell their stories, usually for a fee. Others retained enough skill to become expert weapon sharpeners, or spies for rulers or certain organizations."
