The spells involved the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. The conjuration school had five subschools calling, summoning, teleportation, healing, and creation. A wizard who specialized in conjurations spells was called a conjurer.\nCalling\n Spells of this type took creatures from their natural plane and brought them to the caster. They had one chance to return to their home plane but the spell usually restricted the circumstances that would allow it to do so.\n Creation\n These spells manipulated matter itself to create an object or creature. Most, but not all, of these spells required more magic to hold the creation together after it had been made and when the magic of the spell wore off, the creation simply disappeared and the matter returned to its original form, whatever that may have been. Those that didnt rely on magic to hold it together lasted indefinitely.\n Healing\n These spells channeled positive energy that healed the wounds of creatures and damaged undead. More powerful spells of this type could even call the soul of a dead creature back from the Fugue Plane or its afterlife, should it wish to return.\n Summoning\n Summoning spells brought a creature or object from wherever it currently was to the caster of the spell. When the spell expired, creatures were instantly sent back to wherever they came from, although objects did not unless the spell used to summon them was designed to. If a creature was killed while under the effects of a summoning spell, they instantly disappeared and reformed at the point that they were summoned from.\n Teleportation\n These spells transported the subjects of the spell over great distances, usually via the Astral Plane. The most powerful of these spells could teleport the subject to a destination in another plane entirely. Teleportation spells were often one-way and required another teleportation spell to return."
