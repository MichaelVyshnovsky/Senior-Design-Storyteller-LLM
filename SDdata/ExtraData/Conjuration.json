The [[spell]]s involved the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. The conjuration school had five subschools: '''calling''', '''summoning''', '''teleportation''', '''healing''', and '''creation'''. A [[wizard]] who specialized in conjurations spells was called a ''[[conjurer]]''."
