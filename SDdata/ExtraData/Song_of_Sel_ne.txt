[[File:Imgig Zu and Luna 1.jpg|thumb|right|Aided by the wand of power, the goddess Selûne and a disguised Imgig Zu ride on winged beasts to Toril, with the rest of Imgig's people.]]The '''Song of Selûne''' was a legend about the goddess [[Selûne]] the Moonmaiden.{{Cite comic/The Secret of Selûne's Eye|7-9, 25}}<br/>{{Cite comic/Dungeons & Dragons Classics, Vol. 1|63–65, 81}}

==The story==
The story began with Selûne as a youthful and beautiful goddess, residing in a mystic realm populated by deities. Turning aside from a life of ease, she was impulsive and grew tired of life in her own plane. Thus, she "borrowed" a [[wand of power]] from a god known only as "her father" and used the wand to fly away in a bubble of force, so that she might experience life in other realms. <ref group="note">The idea that Selûne has a father seems rather at odds with other depictions of the goddess and the conventional creation myth of the Realms, in which she is said to have coalesced out of the primordial essence of [[Realmspace]] (''e.g.'', ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' page 141 and ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]'' page 260) and no "father" is mentioned. However, since these sources also say Lord [[Ao]] created Realmspace, it is possible that this "father" is Ao. On the other hand, it is possible that this father is strictly the father of [[Luna]], Selûne's [[avatar]] within the comics.

In time, she traveled to a [[plane]] with a forbidding blood moon palely glowing over a barren land. There, Selûne was smitten by a mysterious and attractive warrior, a lord of his people. The stranger persuaded her to use the wand to transport him and his followers to [[Toril]], riding upon winged beasts, where they planned to settle.

[[File:Imgig Zu and Luna 2.jpg|thumb|right|Imgig Zu reveals himself and seizes the wand of power from Selûne, meaning to slay her with it.]]However, once they landed, he revealed his true form and intentions—he was the monstrous [[Imgig Zu]]. He and his people were hideous shapechanging monsters, set on conquest and ruin. He seized her father's wand of power and intended to kill the deceived goddess. <ref group="note">It seems unlikely that a being like Imgig Zu could so easily kill a goddess. It may be that the wand of power gave him this ability.

Fortunately, help arrived in the form of [[Ostus Agrivar|a brave young wizard]] riding by on horseback and racing to her rescue. Although the wizard was not powerful enough to defeat the monsters, he was capable of causing enough confusion and chaos that Selûne could escape. The goddess, now freed from her subjugation, used the only thing she had left: her own life force. Draining her life force away, she imprisoned the monsters inside a pocket dimension within a gigantic [[moonstone]], which should contain them for all time. She reduced the gem, now known as ''[[Selûne's Eye]]'', in size and gave it to the young mage who'd rescued her for safe keeping.

However, the price of victory had been great. By using her life force, Selûne had weakened herself and sacrificed her immortal youthful vitality and beauty, aging thousands of years. This was a fact she kept hidden from the young wizard.

The story had a few alternate endings, depending on locale and the point the storyteller wished to make. In some, Selûne learned her lesson and went back to her home, and brought the young mage with her. In others, Selûne died because of her sacrifice, but was resurrected come the next full moon. Still others told that the young mage loved her, but she rejected his advances because she was no longer young or beautiful.

It was a classic tale, sad but oft-told, and one most folk of [[Faerûn]] had heard.

==History==
[[Luna]], proprietress of the [[Selûne's Smile]] inn in [[Waterdeep]], and in truth an avatar of the goddess Selûne herself, told the tale as a bedtime story for the young [[kittenlord]] in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]]. His guardian, [[Conner]], overheard and remarked upon how poignantly she told it.

Events proved the tale to be almost entirely true, however, as [[Imgig Zu]] somehow escaped the ''[[Selûne's Eye]]'' gem and sought to release the rest of his people from it.
