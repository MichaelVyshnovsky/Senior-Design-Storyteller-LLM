        "mainbody": "'''Dauntrael''' were a magically powerful clan known in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|79-80}}",
        "History": "During his reign as the [[Magister]] between {{yearlink|1322}} and {{yearlink|1328}}, [[Maxiladanarr Torstren]] fostered marriages for this family with the aim of producing many more children who would be suited to [[the Art]].{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|77}}\n\nThe Dauntraels had numbered strongly in the court of King [[Alemander IV]] of [[Tethyr]], but much of their ranks had been thinned by the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]]. As of {{yearlink|1370}}, two branches survived and served King [[Haedrak]], while other Dauntrael were in [[Westphal]], [[Kingsbay]], and in the [[Moonshaes]].",
        "Appearance": "Members of the family were generally tall and slender, with flowing brown hair that appeared purple or blue under certain lighting. Dauntrael tended to have large, liquid brown or blue eyes, with comely appearances, and a great singing voice.",
        "Abilities": "Only about half of the Dauntrael had the power to rise in the Art, but they rose swiftly, showing great creativity and affinity.",
        "Structure": "About seventy Dauntrael mages existed around {{yearlink|1370}}, and fifty of them were wizards in every sense of the word. The clan was growing eastwards, with members settling in [[Iriaebor]], [[Priapurl]], [[Suzail]] and [[Yhaunn]].\n\nThe patriarch and matriarch of the clan as of {{yearlink|1370}} were [[Thurlad Dauntrael]] and [[Deluma Dauntrael]].",
        "Reputation & Legends": "The Dauntraels had grown to become quite skilled diplomats, and were largely regarded as great neighbors, generous and capable. However, they made an effort not to have too high a profile.\n\nThe Dauntraels believed themselves to have a purpose yet to be revealed by [[Mystra]], and thus saw it as their duty to rise in power. They mostly passed down legends of clever spell use to save the day by their own family, but the most important legend was that of [[Shalima Dauntrael]], whose spirit was seen as the family's ideal.",
        "Notable Dauntraels": "* [[Aelbronter Dauntrael]]\n* [[Deluma Dauntrael]]\n* [[Hemtor Dauntrael]]\n* [[Immrult Dauntrael]]\n* [[Shalima Dauntrael]]\n* [[Tabast Dauntrael]]\n* [[Tethlae Dauntrael]]\n* [[Thurlad Dauntrael]]"
