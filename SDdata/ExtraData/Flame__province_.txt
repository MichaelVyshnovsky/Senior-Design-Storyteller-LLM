The province of flame in the Zakharan view of magic was a group of spells related to the element of fire.
The four elemental provinces played a very similar role for Zakharan magic-users as the eight (or nine) schools of magic did for Faer√ªnian ones.
Zakharan sages speculated that many of the spells from the province of flame were invented by the Geomancers of ancient Kadar.
Elemental mages in Zakhara specialized exclusively in one province, like flame, while sorcerers took spells from two provinces, shunning the other two. Unlike elementalists, magic-users from the Land of Fate recognized no opposition between flame and sea.
The flame was associated with wrath and other burning emotions in Zakharan culture, and most flame mages showed a disposition towards evil.
Zakharan practicioners of path magic recognized four paths of power within the province of flamePaths to power are an alternative system of rules for the spell progression and learning of spells by wizards for 2nd edition Dungeons & Dragons. They could therefore be considered non-canon.
*The Brotherhoods Road, specializing in fiery attack spells
*Flame Dancers Path, shaping and directing fire
*Firesight Path, using fire and light to affect sight and provide insight
*Road of the Efreeti, comprising spells to protect one against the elements and affect elemental fire creatures
