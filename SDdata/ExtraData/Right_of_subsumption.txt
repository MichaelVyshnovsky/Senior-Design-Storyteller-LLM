The '''Right of Subsumption''' was a possibility in [[spell duel]]s within [[Spelldown Hall]].{{cite book/Elminster in Hell/Hardcover 2001|134-135|8}}

==Use==
Right of Subsumption had to be claimed before [[Mystra]] and the [[Mages Arcane]] prior to a spell battle in [[Spelldown Hall]]. If right of subsumption was claimed in a duel, all of the loser's powers were to be granted to the winner.

==History==
At least one [[lich]] claimed the right of subsumption when dueling [[Elminster Aumar]] in Spelldown Hall at an unknown date prior to {{yearlink|1372}}. As other creatures were parties to the duel, that right may or may not have been granted, but some of Elminster's memories were from the perspective of that lich, which strongly implied that Elminster had received the lich's memories since, whether then or at a later date.
