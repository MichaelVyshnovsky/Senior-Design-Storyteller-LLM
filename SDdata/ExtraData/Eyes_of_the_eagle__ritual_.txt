The eyes of the eagle was a special ritual that allowed shairs to enhance the acuity of their gens vision.
A pair of rubies worth at least 300 dinars each was needed to perform the eyes of the eagle. This ritual took 24 hours to complete.
A gen with the eyes of the eagle had far superior vision compared to other "normal" gen, allowing them to spot items and creatures at a much farther distance. These gen were even more keen at noticing hidden doors or spotting individuals attempting to hide themselves within shadows.
