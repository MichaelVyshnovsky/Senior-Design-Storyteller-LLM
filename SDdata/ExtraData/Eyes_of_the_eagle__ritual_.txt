The '''eyes of the eagle''' was a special ritual that allowed [[sha'ir]]s to enhance the acuity of their [[gen]]'s vision.

==Preparation==
A pair of [[ruby|rubies]] worth at least 300 [[dinar]]s each was needed to perform the eyes of the eagle. This ritual took 24 hours to complete.

A gen with the eyes of the eagle had far superior vision compared to other "normal" gen, allowing them to spot items and creatures at a much farther distance. These gen were even more keen at noticing hidden doors or spotting individuals attempting to hide themselves within shadows.
