A '''magocracy''' was a form of government where only those with ability in [[magic]] could wield executive power. Magocracies were commonly also [[Wikipedia:Oligarchy|oligarchies]] or feudal systems, or else democracies or bureaucracies.

{{Quote|One thing I have noticed while traveling across the multiverse: a magocracy, a government led by magi, is rarely a good idea.<br/><br/>Wizards, despite our superior intellectual acumen, are not the best at governing large numbers of people. We wizards can be good administrators, excellent bookkeepers, and advisers par excellence, and we pay exceptional attention to detail (at least the details that interest us). But we have proven time and time again not to be the most compassionate or nurturing when it comes to caring for the masses.|[[Mordenkainen]], ruminating on the magocratic principalities of [[Mystara]].}}
