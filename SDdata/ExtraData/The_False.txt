The False were the souls of those individuals who intentionally betrayed their deities after making a commitment to them during their lifetimes. If judged and found guilty by Kelemvor, they were punished for all eternity. The punishment varied depending on the severity of the crime. The punishment could be anything from escorting visitors to the City of Judgment, to unspeakable tortures.
