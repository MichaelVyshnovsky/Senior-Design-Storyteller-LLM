The '''Valostar''' was an award bestowed by the city of [[Waterdeep]] for acts of service to the city.  It was more of a lifetime achievement award rather than one given for single acts of service.  The award was never given to members of the [[cleric|clergy]] as they were expected to serve without the expectation of reward.{{Cite dungeon/189/Eye on the Realms: A Deadly Civic Honor}}  

==Description==
Made of [[adamantine]], the beautiful medallion was a pin set with a [[sapphire]].
