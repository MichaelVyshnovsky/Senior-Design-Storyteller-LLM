This three-fold curse could result in weakening, loss of intelligence, or the appearance of a glowing apparition of Azuth boldly exclaiming that the writing of the symbol was \"falsely done!\" This apparation could sometimes remain for days, pointing out the offender. Alternatively, some reported the loss of the abilitiy to cast the usual number of spells in a given day, a punishment that last for one month. Modern scholars rejected the idea of the Curse of Mystra as a silly folktale, insisting that such bogus claims were only made by wizards to scare others.\n{{-}}"
