'''Chaunsel''' was a [[drug]] that was used in [[Faer√ªn]].

==Effects==
When applied upon bare skin, chaunsel increased the tactile sensations and touch sensitivity of that area.

Overuse of the drug caused the area of the body to go numb, for a period of several days.

==Uses==
Chaunsel was often used by [[thief|thieves]] or other individuals who had to work in near-complete darkness. It allowed their fingertips to feel even the slightest detail or change in whatever they manipulated.
