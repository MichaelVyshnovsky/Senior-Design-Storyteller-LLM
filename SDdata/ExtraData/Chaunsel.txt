Chaunsel was a drug that was used in Faer√ªn.
When applied upon bare skin, chaunsel increased the tactile sensations and touch sensitivity of that area.
Overuse of the drug caused the area of the body to go numb, for a period of several days.
Chaunsel was often used by thieves or other individuals who had to work in near-complete darkness. It allowed their fingertips to feel even the slightest detail or change in whatever they manipulated.
