The '''province of wind''' in the [[Zakhara]]n view of [[magic]] was a group of spells related to the element of [[air]], felt most clearly in the free-roaming winds in the Land of Fate.

The four elemental provinces played a very similar role for Zakharan magic-users as the eight (or nine) [[schools of magic]] did for [[Faer√ªn]]ian ones.

==History==
Zakharan sages speculated that many of the spells from the province of wind were invented by the [[Geomancer]]s of ancient [[Kadar]].

==Users==
[[Elemental mage]]s in Zakhara specialized exclusively in one province, like wind, while [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]] took spells from two provinces, shunning the other two. Unlike [[elementalist]]s,<ref> magic-users from the Land of Fate recognized no opposition between wind and [[Sand (province)|sand]].

==Paths of power==
Zakharan practicioners of [[path magic]] recognized four paths of power within the province of wind:{{Cite dragon/216/Paths of Power}}<ref group="note">Paths to power are an alternative system of rules for the spell progression and learning of spells by [[wizards]] for [[2nd edition]] [[Dungeons & Dragons]]. They could therefore be considered non-canon.
*[[Wind mage|Wind Mage]]'s Road, containing a variety of spells manipulating winds, air, sound and visibility
*Windwielder's Path, using air to distract and attack
*The Skyrider's Path, mainly allowing easy travel and flight
*The [[Djinni]]'s Greater Path, comprising spells to protect one against the elements and affect elemental air creatures
