The province of wind in the Zakharan view of magic was a group of spells related to the element of air, felt most clearly in the free-roaming winds in the Land of Fate.
The four elemental provinces played a very similar role for Zakharan magic-users as the eight (or nine) schools of magic did for Faer√ªnian ones.
Zakharan sages speculated that many of the spells from the province of wind were invented by the Geomancers of ancient Kadar.
Elemental mages in Zakhara specialized exclusively in one province, like wind, while sorcerers took spells from two provinces, shunning the other two. Unlike elementalists, magic-users from the Land of Fate recognized no opposition between wind and sand.
Zakharan practicioners of path magic recognized four paths of power within the province of windPaths to power are an alternative system of rules for the spell progression and learning of spells by wizards for 2nd edition Dungeons & Dragons. They could therefore be considered non-canon.
*Wind Mages Road, containing a variety of spells manipulating winds, air, sound and visibility
*Windwielders Path, using air to distract and attack
*The Skyriders Path, mainly allowing easy travel and flight
*The Djinnis Greater Path, comprising spells to protect one against the elements and affect elemental air creatures
*Spells in the province of wind
