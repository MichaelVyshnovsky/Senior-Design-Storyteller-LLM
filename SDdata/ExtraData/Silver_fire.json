Thus, the clashing of silver fire with pure shadow magic could tear the fabric of the multiverse, causing huge dimensional rifts between the planes.\nLess than once an hour, a Chosen of Mystra could unleash a beam of whitish magical flame known as silver fire. These beams were  wide and could be made to extend as far as  if desired. No magical or physical barrier had been discovered that could stand up against silver fire, and the beam inflicted tremendous damage on all beings struck. Any non-living objects touched by the beams were utterly destroyed. An individual was able to expel silver fire in the shape of a cloud that filled a cone-shaped area  in diameter at its base, up to  long, and up to  across at its widest. This silver cloud caused no damage, but banished dead magic areas forever, instantly restoring such an areas connection with the Goddess of All Magic. This use of the silver fire was extremely rare, since Mystra considered its usage an emergency action only.\nSilver fire could be activated within the body of a Chosen to purge all external magical and psionic compulsions from that person. Once per day, an individual could teleport without error to the last location where it used its silver fire in any manner.\nA portion of a Chosens silver fire could be used to hold the knowledge of how to cast a particular spell within a Chosens mind. While held in this way, these spells could be cast by silent force of will alone, without the need for verbal, somatic, or material components.\nIn Shadowdale in the Year of Wild Magic (1372 DR), Elminster fended off several invading Shadow Princes, who were actually shadow-mattered creatures. His silver fire vaporized one of them, but also created a rift between Toril and the Nine Hells. Elminster jumped into the Nine Hells and sealed the rift from there, but such an act also burned all his magical energy and left him entirely helpless in the Hells. Only with the help of the Simbul did the archmage finally escape.\nNovels\nReturn of the Archwizards (The Summoning) • Elminster series (Elminster in Hell • Elminster Enraged) • The Herald\nCategoryMagic\n2u6xvgphyer4h9x02rppp0volxiq2yt"
