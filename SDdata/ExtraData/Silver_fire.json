        "Description": {
            "Usage": "Less than once an hour, a Chosen of Mystra could unleash a beam of whitish magical flame known as silver fire. These beams were {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} wide and could be made to extend as far as {{SI|70|ft|long=yes}} if desired. No magical or physical barrier had been discovered that could stand up against silver fire, and the beam inflicted tremendous damage on all beings struck. Any non-living objects touched by the beams were utterly destroyed. An individual was able to expel silver fire in the shape of a cloud that filled a cone-shaped area {{SI|5|ft|long=yes}} in diameter at its base, up to {{SI|70|ft|long=yes}} long, and up to {{SI|70|ft|long=yes}} across at its widest. This silver cloud caused no damage, but banished [[dead magic]] areas forever, instantly restoring such an area's connection with the Goddess of All Magic. This use of the silver fire was extremely rare, since Mystra considered its usage an emergency action only.\n\nSilver fire could be activated within the body of a Chosen to purge all external magical and [[psionic]] compulsions from that person. Once per day, an individual could ''[[teleport without error]]'' to the last location where it used its silver fire in any manner.\n\nA portion of a Chosen's silver fire could be used to hold the knowledge of how to cast a particular [[spell]] within a Chosen's mind. While held in this way, these spells could be cast by silent force of will alone, without the need for [[verbal]], [[somatic]], or [[material component]]s.{{Cite digital book/Elminster Enraged/Kindle|508}}"

        "History": "In [[Shadowdale]] in the Year of Wild Magic ([[1372 DR]]), [[Elminster]] fended off several invading [[Princes of Shade|Shadow Princes]], who were actually shadow-mattered creatures. His silver fire vaporized one of them, but also created a rift between [[Toril]] and the [[Nine Hells]]. Elminster jumped into the Nine Hells and sealed the rift from there, but such an act also burned all his magical energy and left him entirely helpless in the Hells. Only with the help of the [[Simbul]] did the [[archmage]] finally escape.",
