The Tales From the Yawning Portal season provides introductory adventures for all of the modules included in the hardcover, framing them to take place in the Forgotten Realms if they were originally designed to take place on worlds other than Toril. There are also Epics for each module so higher-level characters can enjoy adventuring at these sites without being too powerful. It is thematically linked to Tales from the Yawning Portal.
