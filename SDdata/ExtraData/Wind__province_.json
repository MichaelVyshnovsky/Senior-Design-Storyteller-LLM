        "History": "Zakharan sages speculated that many of the spells from the province of wind were invented by the [[Geomancer]]s of ancient [[Kadar]].",
        "Users": "[[Elemental mage]]s in Zakhara specialized exclusively in one province, like wind, while [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]] took spells from two provinces, shunning the other two. Unlike [[elementalist]]s,<ref> magic-users from the Land of Fate recognized no opposition between wind and [[Sand (province)|sand]].",
        "Paths of power": "Zakharan practicioners of [[path magic]] recognized four paths of power within the province of wind:{{Cite dragon/216/Paths of Power}}<ref group=\"note\">Paths to power are an alternative system of rules for the spell progression and learning of spells by [[wizards]] for [[2nd edition]] [[Dungeons & Dragons]]. They could therefore be considered non-canon.\n*[[Wind mage|Wind Mage]]'s Road, containing a variety of spells manipulating winds, air, sound and visibility\n*Windwielder's Path, using air to distract and attack\n*The Skyrider's Path, mainly allowing easy travel and flight\n*The [[Djinni]]'s Greater Path, comprising spells to protect one against the elements and affect elemental air creatures",
