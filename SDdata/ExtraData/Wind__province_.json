Unlike elementalists, magic-users from the Land of Fate recognized no opposition between wind and sand.\nZakharan practicioners of path magic recognized four paths of power within the province of windPaths to power are an alternative system of rules for the spell progression and learning of spells by wizards for 2nd edition Dungeons & Dragons. They could therefore be considered non-canon.\n*Wind Mages Road, containing a variety of spells manipulating winds, air, sound and visibility\n*Windwielders Path, using air to distract and attack\n*The Skyriders Path, mainly allowing easy travel and flight\n*The Djinnis Greater Path, comprising spells to protect one against the elements and affect elemental air creatures\n*Spells in the province of wind\n__NOTOC__\nCategorySchools of magic\nCategorySchools of effect\nCategoryMagic\nif4vsaroqvude1d5pevb605bthavbrx"
