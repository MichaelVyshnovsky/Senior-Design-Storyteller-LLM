They were worshiped as quasi-divine beings by the people of the [[Bedine]] tribes.",
        "Description": "While they were rarely encountered by mortals, place spirits were entirely real and substantive on [[Toril]]. They each inhabited a different landmark each―such as an [[:category:oases|oasis]], [[:Category:Mountains|mountain]], or [[:category:mesas|mesa]]―and did not travel beyond their place of power.\n\nPlace spirits could be slain just like any [[demipower]]. If the spirit of any place was destroyed, a whole calendar year would have to pass before a new one could reform.",

            "Magic": "While they were highly resistant to [[magic]], place spirits could imbue anyone within their territory limited [[spellcaster|spellcasting]] power up to a certain level. Additionally, they could perform wondrous feats for their worshipers once or several times per day as they so decided. Place spirits were capable of ''[[regenerate|healing wounds]]'', ''[[restoration|restoring a person's life essence]]'', ''[[raise dead|brining the dead back to life]]'', and even ''[[limited wish|grant wishes]]'' to their faithful."

        "Relationships": "The Bedine tribes of Anauroch were well-versed in the lore of the desert's place spirits and respected the power they held. The spirits themselves appreciated the respect and worship the Bedine offered and were tolerant of non-violent outlanders.",
