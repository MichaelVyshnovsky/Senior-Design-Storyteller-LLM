They were worshiped as quasi-divine beings by the people of the Bedine tribes.\nWhile they were rarely encountered by mortals, place spirits were entirely real and substantive on Toril. They each inhabited a different landmark each―such as an oasis, mountain, or mesa―and did not travel beyond their place of power.\nPlace spirits could be slain just like any demipower. If the spirit of any place was destroyed, a whole calendar year would have to pass before a new one could reform. \nPlace spirits held strong prescience over all activity that occurred on or around their landmark up to  away. They could communicate verbally or telpathically with anyone upon their land, appear as manifestations, or create focal points in the heart of their place of power. Some spirits could only manifest in a single instance at once while others could form two manifestations. \nThe spirits could also transfer between their places on the Prime Material plane to their corresponding locations within the ethereal plane. \nWhile they were highly resistant to magic, place spirits could imbue anyone within their territory limited spellcasting power up to a certain level. Additionally, they could perform wondrous feats for their worshipers once or several times per day as they so decided. Place spirits were capable of healing wounds, restoring a persons life essence, brining the dead back to life, and even grant wishes to their faithful.\nThe Bedine tribes of Anauroch were well-versed in the lore of the deserts place spirits and respected the power they held. The spirits themselves appreciated the respect and worship the Bedine offered and were tolerant of non-violent outlanders.\n* El Mara Dat-ur Ojhogo, the \"tall god who lets men sit upon his head\" of the El Mara oasis and mesa.\n* Rahalat, the Bedine sorceress whose spirit resided within an oasis after she was murdered by her own people.\n* Nature spirit\nNovels\nThe Parched Sea\nPlace spirits\nCategoryDeities by power\nCategoryDeities\nCategoryYear of Miracles\noanw9x0wklown31xr69vh1bmkqdpmlm"
