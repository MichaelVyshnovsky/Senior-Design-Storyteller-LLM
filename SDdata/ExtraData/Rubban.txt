'''''Rubban''''' was the term used to describe the captain of a sailing vessel in [[Zakhara]].

==Activities==
Sometimes, the ''rubban'' and ''[[nakhuda]]'', or owner, were the same person. A rubban was in charge of overseeing the safety and daily operation of the ship and her crew. While at sea, a rubban had full authority, deferring to the ''nakhuda'' only while in port.
