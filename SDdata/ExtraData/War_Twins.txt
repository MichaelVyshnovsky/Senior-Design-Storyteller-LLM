The '''War Twins''' were gods of the [[Azuposi]] civilization in [[Maztica]].

==Matsailema==
[[Matsailema]] was one of the War Twins. According to Azuposi legend, he went on a rampage through the world, but became tired and laid down to rest on the banks of the [[Pasocada River]], where a local man and woman took pity on him and provided food and drink. As a reward for their kindness, he pledged to provide prosperity for the Azuposi people, creating the settlement of [[Yapoza]] at the location where he took his rest, and put into place a matrilineal society to keep some degree of control over the Azuposi.
