        "Society": "Drow who wanted to change the society under [[Lolth]] and her clergy were considered a danger, especially if they challenged the authority of the goddess and her [[cleric]]s. Drow mages were generally suspected of belonging to this group and were subjected to the Test.\n\nNon-mages were also often subjected to this test if they reached a sufficient degree of strength. Priestesses could also be subjected to it but they could hope for an immediate reward in the form of promotion on passing.",
