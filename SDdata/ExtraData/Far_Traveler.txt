The Far Traveler was a constellation in the sky above Sildëyuir. Its name originated from a lovelorn character in Sildëyuiran mythology an elder elf whose love for the Bright Star was parted by events for centuries, but in the end they found the way back to each other. 
Circa the mid–14 century DR, Kiril Duskmourn used the pet name Far Traveler for his love, Nangulis, in honor of the constellation.
