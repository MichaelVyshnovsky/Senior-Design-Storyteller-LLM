This could be an item, a place, or specific person, as the manifester chose. Consumed with hatred or disgust, the target was driven to completely destroy it as soon as they could. However, if this was entirely against their basic nature (for example, a cleric made to find a shrine to their god repugnant), they might shake it off.\nIt could require contact and mindlink to learn.\nRepugnance was known by hauns, whod use it to disrupt foes as they escaped.\nIn psionics terms, repugnance could be known by yuan-ti, whod use it to make targets find snakes repugnant.\nCategoryTelepathy powers\n8wv5ataj2umgjjlthl8peh3syccle8w"
