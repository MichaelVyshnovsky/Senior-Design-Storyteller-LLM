        "Practitioners": "Practitioners of spellsong were known as [[spellsinger]]s and were individuals who had the innate ability to use their voice to produce melodies with magical properties. Training could only refine this ability. Spellsingers were mostly female [[humans]] and [[half-elves]].",
        "Powers": "The process of using this art consisted of singing and dancing alone or with other spellsingers, usually around a focus or a creature intended to receive the effects of the magic.\n\nSpellsingers could use their art to work a variety of magical effects, but the song of a single caster was not very powerful and could create magic whose power was comparable to [[cantrip]]s or [[orison]]s. Multiple spellsingers could dance and sing in coordination to perform rituals capable of working more powerful magic, like healing wounded or ill creatures located near the casters (albeit generally not with the same power of major healing spells); sending simple messages, visions or indications to individuals known to the majority of the casters; repelling [[undead]] or [[evil]] creatures; and making [[magic item]]s glow, activate or levitate.\n\nParticularly powerful spellsingers had the ability to use their song to call upon the [[Weave]], invoking spells similar in power to those of a [[wizard]] or [[sorcerer]].",
