Mystras Choice was an offer that Mystra made upon a Magister, and a few others amongst her servants, upon death. Almost nothing was known of it.
Mystras Choice was only offered to Magisters who had created at least one new spell.
Those who failed to create at least one spell were counted as failures. They could ask to be annihilated utterly, or they could become creatures such as wizshades, will o wisps, wingless wonders or tarsardar. Other magisters could reincarnate into creatures such as dragons, weredragons, beholders or unicorns, save for the additional powers they gained they gained one spell of their choice, useable once a day, and they became immune to nine spells of different levels of power. However, they lost any and all memory of why they had such powers, with only a bit of it to be regained in old age.
The body of one who had been the subject of Mystras Choice would not respond to speak with dead, rendering the topic especially obscure. Though some lived beyond Mystras Choice, none did so unchanged, even those whose bodies were put back together and left to go on their way.
Those who had served Mystra well could choose to become shadowstaves, reborn, or could bargain for a unique fate, most often becoming a major artifact.
