'''Dimensional planes''' were pseudo-realities that permeated all the known [[planes of existence]]. Some considered them to be building blocks of reality that allowed for the coexistence of all the planes. The concept of these planes was typically beyond what the minds of most [[humanoid]]s could fathom.

==Description==
The known dimensional planes included the [[Temporal Prime]] and '''spatial dimensions''', with potentially others existing.

==Types of Dimension Planes==
===Temporal Prime===
The Temporal Prime was a dimension in which the various '''timestreams''' of the multiverse could be observed and used to move through time, ''i.e.'', [[time travel]]. Many sages on the [[Prime Material]] and even some [[chronomancer]]s believed it to be a kind of [[demiplane]] trying to make fit it into their pre-existing notions and theories on the multiverse. However, many chronomancers swore that "dimensional plane" was the more technically correct term for the Temporal Prime.

===Spatial Dimensions===
The first three spatial dimensions were referred to as '''length''', '''width''',

The majority of lifeforms, such as [[human]]s and humanoids, existed in three-dimensional space and could only perceive the first three spatial dimensions. Some life forms could be found in higher dimensional spaces, such as the [[w:c:spelljammer:misi|misi]], which existed solely on the fourth through sixth spatial dimensions. Creatures of higher dimensional planes were often noted as not being able to see or interact with creatures of the lower dimensional planes.

With the right tools, powerful [[mage]]s could open their perceptions to higher dimensional planes, such as [[Szass Tam]], who created a nine-dimensional [[map]] of all then-surviving [[Dread Ring]]s in [[Faer√ªn]] whilst wielding the crystal [[staff]] of the [[Zulkir]] [[Yaphyll]] in [[1478 DR]]. However, this was an incredibly strenuous endeavor for even the most powerful of living or [[undead]] mages like Szass Tam, who collapsed from exhaustion shortly after dispelling his ninth-dimensional map.{{Cite organized play/LC/Whistling in the Dark|16}}
