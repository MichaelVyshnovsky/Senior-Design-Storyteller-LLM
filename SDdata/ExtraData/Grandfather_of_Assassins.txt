'''Grandfather of Assassins''' was the title of the leader of the [[Citadel of Assassins]] in the [[Galena Mountains]] in [[Damara]].

==Description==
The Grandfather always concealed his face with a mask and was said to be immortal. In truth, once a Grandfather got old and died, a new one was chosen to take his place. This superstition that the Grandfather could not die was one of the guild's many terror weapons. Parents in [[Vaasa]] and Damara often threatened naughty children by telling them that the Grandfather would come take them away if they didn't behave.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1357}}, an [[unnamed Grandfather of Assassins]], in league with the Witch-King [[Zhengyi]], and priests of [[Orcus]], attacked [[Bloodstone Village]] with an army of mainly [[human]] brigands and [[orcs]], but also with [[wyvern]]s, [[giant]]s, and other monsters. This attack was thwarted by the [[paladin]] [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and his party of adventurers and the Grandfather was killed by the monk [[Kane]].

The next Grandfather of Assassins was [[Timoshenko]], who played the political face of the organization. His chief lieutenant, the wizard [[Knellict]], carried out the dirty work.<ref>
