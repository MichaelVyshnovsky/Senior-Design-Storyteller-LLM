        "Organization": "They were held every two years on the [[Fields of Pryollus]] at the foot of [[Mount Thulbane]] in [[Threskel]]. They lasted for one week and during this time, all wars in Chessenta were put on hold.\n\nTheir purpose was to discover the very best athletes of Chessenta. Winners were considered heroes in their home cities, and even slaves were treated like nobility if they did well.",
        "History": "King [[Theris]] of [[Mourktar]] held his own games on the site in the [[1357 DR|Year of the Prince, 1357 DR]] in order to choose his successor. The attempt failed, however.Theris's games are not stated to be the Thulbanian Games themselves, only a similar event held on the same site.\n\nAfter the [[dragon]]s [[Alasklerbanbastos]] and [[Jaxanaedegor]] took over Threskel in the [[1365 DR|Year of the Sword, 1365 DR]], the Games remained on hold. By [[1374 DR]], organizers were considering relocating the games well out of Jaxanaedegor's domain.",
        "Events": "In keeping with traditional Chessentan sports, all the competitions were individual events, not team sports. Popular events were chariot-racing over an obstacle course, running, long jumping, throwing [[javelin]]s and discuses, and boxing, but the most popular were wrestling and [[pankration]].\n\nAll athletes competed nude.\n\nEvening entertainment consisted of big feasts and poets and theater troupes performing for the crowds.",
