        "Usage": "Each stone needed to have a smooth side and a rough side to be suitable. The stone's color symbolized different aspects: black for land, blue for sea, white for woman, red for man, brown for camel. The ''[[evil eye]]'' could be cast by crushing a white or red stone while saying a person's name. Many other effects could be produced by combining different stones and uttering appropriate phrases. Casting the stone like dice allowed the practitioner to read the future. These predictions could be extremely accurate depending on the skill of the user.",
        "Practitioners": "This magic was used exclusively by female [[dwarves]] inhabiting the village of [[Yarrat]] in the High Desert of Zakhara.",
