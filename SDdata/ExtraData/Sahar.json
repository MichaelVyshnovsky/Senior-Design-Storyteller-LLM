The stones color symbolized different aspects black for land, blue for sea, white for woman, red for man, brown for camel. The evil eye could be cast by crushing a white or red stone while saying a persons name. Many other effects could be produced by combining different stones and uttering appropriate phrases. Casting the stone like dice allowed the practitioner to read the future. These predictions could be extremely accurate depending on the skill of the user.\nThis magic was used exclusively by female dwarves inhabiting the village of Yarrat in the High Desert of Zakhara.\nCategoryMagic\n0ljlbydyxmxrq0286nrk3npckd3i2n9"
