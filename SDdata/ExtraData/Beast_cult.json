        "mainbody": "Beast cult''' was a term used to refer to a variety of different, less organized or \"primitive\" belief systems in the Realms. A more archaic term for referring to such groups in the plural was '''Cults of the Beast'''.",
        "Types of Beast Cults": "Some beast cults worshiped certain animal-related [[deities]], typically on the level of [[demipower]]s or [[lesser power]]s, such as [[Lurue|Lurue the Unicorn Queen]]{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Incarnates, Soulborn, Totemists}} and [[Nobanion|Nobanion the King of Beasts]]. Such groups could be divided into benevolent and malevolent cults.\n\nOthers worshiped living monsters or mundane animals, considering them to be emissaries of the gods, the embodiments of divine wrath,{{Cite dragon/373/The Dragon's Bestiary: The Brood of Alloces|39}} or a \"perfect form\" of their species. Some for example worshiped [[dragon]]s, especially in the ancient days of [[Toril]], considering them to be truly divine creatures. Those who believed the creature they worshiped was the \"perfect form\" of their species, viewed it as the leader or master of all others in their species.",
        "Activities": "The dress and practices of beast cults varied significantly from location to location and from the beast or deity worshiped. Though in [[northwest Faerûn]], [[totem]]s were a typical aspect of beast cults.<ref><ref>\n\nBenevolent beast cults tended to try living in harmony with nature, cherishing and praising the nobility of their patron, while malevolent cults tended to revel in bloodlust, brutality, and savagery.",
        "Equipment, Spells, and Relics": "The type of powers that a beast cult [[cleric]] received varied with the cult, but there were some commonalities. Such clerics typically received access to the [[animal sphere]], as well as either the [[charm sphere|charm]], [[combat sphere|combat]], [[plant sphere|plant]], or [[weather sphere]]. They also could [[shapechange]] into the type of creature they worshiped and had access to [[spell]]s that would [[summon]] creatures of that type.\n\nBesides clerics, beast cults that venerated [[magical beast]]s were known to harbor [[totemist]]s, [[shaman]]s who learned to shape the spiritual energy associated with their beast into magical effects.",
        "Practitioners": "Beast cults often attracted nomads, [[evil]] [[humanoid]]s, and individuals that were removed from the normal circles of civilized society. Such people typically did their best to keep their activities and cult a secret, especially in urban areas. Performing their religious rites and sacrifices covertly.\n\nBeast cults were also quite common in tribal cultures.",
