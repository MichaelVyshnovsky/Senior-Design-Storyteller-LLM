        "mainbody": "oreball was a dangerous competitive team sport played in Faer√ªn.\nGoreball was played between two teams, each of which had eight members. The central piece of the game was a gibbering mouther that was shaped into a ball. The playing field was a long and narrow grass-covered pitch, which had lines at each end representing a teams goal. The aim of the game was to maneuver the mouther across the opposing goal line. The first team to reach 13 goals won the game. A game of goreball could also result in a tie, which resulted in Endless Sudden Death. Under this rule, the game continued until a final point was scored or none of the players could play anymore. The sport was made difficult due to the mouthers spittle and gibbering.\nThe game had a number of different positions, each associated with different tactics\n* Wranglers were tasked with moving the mouther towards the goal.\n* Smashers acted aggressively to push other players around and towards the mouther.\n* Shield-bearers defended their team against the dangerous mouther.\n* Each team also had one Fresh Meat, who lured the mouther towards the goal themselves. This position was the most desired but also the most dangerous.\nImportant to the play of goreball were formations, which were planned out in advance and had names. One formation, the Statue of Cyric maneuver, was popularized by the Luskan Giants team. It involved using the spell polymorph to transform a player into something fearsome to distract the opposing team.  \nPlayers typically wore colored spiked jerkins, while earmuffs were banned items. \nThe Dungeon Academy Flumphs was a goreball team that represented the Dungeon Academy. Their rivals were the more successful Waterdeep Dragons. Another team was the Luskan Giants. \n* Kifin Stormclash was the minotaur coach who trained the Dungeon Academy Flumphs. \n* A slender green dragon was the coach for the Waterdeep Dragons. \n* Hugo and Snabla of the Danger Club were fans of goreball, \nGoreball was played as part of the Tourney of Terror, a grand competition between the Dungeon Academy Flumphs and the Waterdeep Dragons. It had been held every 50 years, for about 300 years. In one match, 150 years prior to the Tourney of Terror that the Danger Club attended, a period of Endless Sudden Death continued for nearly three days."
