{{main|World_Tree_cosmology#Celestial_Planes}}
'''Celestial planes''' is a collective term used to describe a subset of the [[Outer Planes]] in the [[World Tree cosmology]] model. The celestial planes were generally associated with the [[good]] deities whereas the [[fiendish planes]] were generally associated with the [[evil]] ones. The celestial planes were:
# [[Arvandor]]
# [[Brightwater]]
# [[Dwarfhome]]
# [[Dweomerheart]]
# The [[Gates of the Moon]]
# [[Golden Hills]]
# [[Green Fields]]
# The [[House of Knowledge (plane)|House of Knowledge]]
# The [[House of the Triad]]
All of these planes were connected to the [[World Tree]] which could be used to travel directly between planes without having to pass through the [[Prime Material Plane]], but this mode of travel was often dangerous.
