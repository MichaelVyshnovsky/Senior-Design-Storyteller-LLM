The '''Songs & Swords''' series by [[Elaine Cunningham]] covers the adventures of [[Arilyn Moonblade]] and [[Danilo Thann]]. Several of the books were originally part of the loosely-connected [[The Harpers series|Harpers series]], but as the story of Arilyn Moonblade became more fleshed out and the books became more popular, they were joined together as their own series.

The final book of the series, to be called ''Reclamation'', was cancelled. ''Reclamation'' planned to address who Princess [[Amnestria]]'s child was, unravel the mystery of the [[moonblade]]s, and to chronicle the royal matters of [[Evermeet]].<ref>https://candlekeep.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=10898
