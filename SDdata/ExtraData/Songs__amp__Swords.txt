The Songs & Swords series by Elaine Cunningham covers the adventures of Arilyn Moonblade and Danilo Thann. Several of the books were originally part of the loosely-connected Harpers series, but as the story of Arilyn Moonblade became more fleshed out and the books became more popular, they were joined together as their own series.
The final book of the series, to be called Reclamation, was cancelled. Reclamation planned to address who Princess Amnestrias child was, unravel the mystery of the moonblades, and to chronicle the royal matters of Evermeet.https//candlekeep.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=10898
