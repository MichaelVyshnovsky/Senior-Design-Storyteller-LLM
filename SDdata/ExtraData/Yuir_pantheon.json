These gods came to be associated with the [[Yuir]] elves when they established homes within those woodlands after the [[Crown Wars]]. After the formation of the Kingdom of Aglarond, the [[half-elf|half-elven]] descendants of the Yuir elves had abandoned these gods in favor of more common human or elvish gods and it was assumed that without worshipers, the deities in this pantheon had ceased to exist. Half of these deities however had long ago been subsumed by various members of the [[Seldarine]].",

        "Rumors & Legends": "Around 1368 DR, some of the half-elves who'd begun worshiping the Yuir pantheon would even go so far as to claim that those deities were \"stirring from their slumber\" and would return soon; some also said that these returning deities would be hostile to humans and would seek to drive the interlopers from Aglarond. In the same year, the explorer [[Talyssa]] reported feeling a presence in the Sunglade when she visited and entered the circle of menhirs.\n\n{{Quote|In that moment, I felt a presence in the stone circle of the Sunglade – ancient and far away, but very much alive. And the most disturbing thing was the distinct sensation of hostility which washed over me. It was old, and it still slept, but it most assuredly did not like me.|From Talyssa's report}}",
