        "mainbody": "he Grandmaster of Shadows was the highest authority of the Shadow Thieves of Amn, the most powerful thieves guilds in all of Faer√ªn. The Grandmaster oversaw the Shadow Council, the 8-person governing body that oversaw the six sects that comprised the guilds area of influence and their foreign information-gathering endeavors.\n*Carzakh Halandir (~1300 DR-1358 DR)\nA former assassin known as \"Deepshadow\", Carzakh was one of the founding agents of the original Shadow Thieves of Waterdeep, and the only one who survived the infiltration and culling of the guild by the \"Masked Lady\", Lhestyn Arunsun. He kept the Shadow Thieves alive by resettling them in Amn, restructuring their hierarchy and diversifying their membership to focus less on assassins and thieves by recruiting more arcane and divine spellcasters.\n*Rhinnom Dannihyr (1358 DR-?)\nRhinnom Dannihyr was an adept agent of the Shadow Thieves during his early years within the guild, quickly ascending to the rank of Guildmaster of Spies within Athkatla. When Deepshadow and the Shades of the council died during the culling of Bhaal-worshiping assassins by the clergies of Myrkul and Bane during the Time of Troubles, Rhinnom ascended to the rank of Grandmaster, in order to stabilize the power vacuum that arose.\nUnbeknownst to many, Grandmaster Dannihyr was also the Iltarch of the Council of Six, a rank he achieved in 1362 DR following the Council Schism. By the 15 century House Dannihyr continued to have control over the Shadow Thieves as well as the Tessarch seat on the Council of Five."
