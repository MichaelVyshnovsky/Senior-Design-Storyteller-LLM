        "Properties": "Meteors and meteorites ranged in size considerably, from microscopically small<ref> to incredibly large.{{Cite organized play/LC/Hammer of Fire|2}}\n\nMeteors were known to contain a variety of different materials that they distributed to planets through their crashing. The most notable of these was [[star metal]],<ref>{{Cite dragon/72/Gems Galore|22}}<ref><ref> which could be used to make various [[enchanted]] [[armor]] and weaponry,<ref><ref> and [[meteorite iron]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/123/Fire for Effect!|35}}{{Cite dragon/148/Always Wear Your Best Suit|17}} Other materials that could potentially be found in meteors included [[adamantine]],<ref> [[agni mani]], [[skydrop]], and allegedly the metal [[hellthorn]].\n\nSome meteors, referred to as [[star-spore]]s, were infested with strange [[fungi]].\n\nWhile meteors could potentially land anywhere on Toril, they had a propensity for landing within its deserts, such as the [[Anauroch]] and the [[Raurin Desert]]. This led to the creation and distribution of [[wikipedia:en:tektite|tektites]]&mdash;glass-like objects formed from the heat of meteors meeting [[sand]] &mdash; such as Agni mani and skydrop, across the sands of Anauroch and other Faerunian deserts. Additionally, the impact of meteors with deserts could transform the sand around their impact point into [[slipsand]].<ref>",
        "Usage": "* Some kept meteorites purely as decorative display pieces, as was the case with [[Sibonseni]], who kept a handful in her private villa.<ref>{{Cite organized play/AL/Peril at the Port|36}}\n* Making a ''[[ring of shooting stars]]'' could require pieces of meteorites.<ref><ref>",
        "Reputation": "Some cultures in the Realms tied religious significance to meteors or meteor showers. In the [[Moonshae Isles]], this natural phenomenon was one of many that was believed to be a sign that one of the [[Earthmother]]'s children had passed away. Among the [[Elven pantheon]], the deities [[Corellon]] and [[Sehanine Moonbow]] sometimes displayed their favor to worshipers by manifesting a meteor. Sehanine was also known to show her favor through meteor showers, while Corellon sometimes displayed his disfavor with someone by manifesting a shooting star that would look to those below as if it had fallen from between the tips of a crescent moon like some kind of heavenly tear.\n\nWithin the [[Maztican pantheon]], meteors were associated with the god [[Kukul]]. Among the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]], a shooting star was said to indicate the presence of [[Horus-Re]] at night.<ref>",
        "Notable Meteors": "* Sometime in Toril's distant past, a cataclysmic meteor strike in the [[Frozenfar]] left an unusual rift exposing rich veins of [[copper]] and [[silver]], which later became the site of the mining town [[Fireshear]].<ref>\n* Sometime around [[Midsummer]] in [[-5000 DR]], a meteor fell upon the central settlements of [[elf|elven]] realm of [[Uvaeren]]. In the wake of that fallen star came a widespread meteor shower, whose stars all set aflame trees across western [[Arcorar]] for a period of twelve days. These fires cleared a wide gash into the forest along the direction of the first meteor, decimating the Lorelands of Uvaeren<ref> and separating [[Rystall Wood]] from the rest of the [[Cormanthor]].\n* The [[Hammer of Fire (meteor)|Hammer of Fire]] was a massive fiery meteor that was on a collision course with Toril sometime in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It had the potential to be the most cataclysmic event in the planet's history,{{Cite organized play/LC/Hammer of Fire|27}} they borrowed the [[galleon|space galleon]] ''[[Mooney's Marauder]]'' and took off into [[Realmspace]] with twenty [[powderkeg]]s of [[blast powder]], gifted to them by Iggy's associate, the [[giff]] Major [[Plunker Big-Boom]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Hammer of Fire|31-32}} Though they were delayed by the efforts of [[Talosian]]s, the adventurers managed to destroy the Hammer of Fire before it could reach the planet.{{Cite organized play/LC/Hammer of Fire|38}}\n* A meteorite that fell into the [[Elven Woods]] on Toril thousands of years before the Time of Troubles was responsible for shaping the land into what would later be known as [[Mistledale]].\n* A meteor that fell to Toril in primeval times was widely believed to be the source of hellthorn. Many rumors surrounded the meteorite, with some speculating it housed a diabolic entity or a fragment of [[Asmodeus]]'s original divinity. In early [[1479 DR]], the priests among the [[devil]]-worshiping [[duergar]] that took control of [[Gauntlgrym]] believed that the meteorite was somewhere beneath that ancient [[dwarf|dwarven]] city.\n* The Great Rift in the city of [[Omu]] was created by a meteorite that was carrying [[russet mold]] spores, leading to the creation of [[vegepygmies]] in the surrounding area.<ref>\n* The eldritch [[Star Worm]] was brought to Toril in ''circa'' [[400 DR]] by a meteorite twice the size of a temple that fell near [[Ixtzul Valley]] in [[Maztica]]'s [[Far Payit]] region.<ref><ref>\n* The ''[[Tear of Selûne]]'', a [[diamond]] approximately the size of an [[ogre]]'s fist that fell to the cold lands of [[Thar]] on Toril during the [[Time of Troubles]].<ref>\n* A great meteorite containing star metal struck the island of [[Tuern]] in [[1358 DR]]. Its starmetal quickly became of great interest to both the [[Kraken Society]] and local [[fire giant]]s. The [[Heroes of Ascore]] managed to recover some of this starmetal, bringing to [[Allis Lhyssich's Hand Crafted Weapons and Magical Weapons for Noble Causes]] to be forged into the ''[[sword of stonecutting]]''.{{SavageGateway-time}}",
        "History": "Over a hundred myths across Faerûn claimed that the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] was created by a massive meteor that fell from the [[Tears of Selûne]], or from even further beyond the moon [[Selûne]]. According to the ''[[Parwiccan Cycle]]'', it was more of a shower of meteors that fell in {{Yearlink|-31000}}, creating a series of natural catastrophes across Toril that destroyed whole continents in earthquakes, fires, and windstorms, rearranging even the positions of the four inner seas. Ancient [[sarrukh]] accounts called this event the \"changing of the stars\",<ref> while other people referred to it as the [[Tearfall]].\n\nThe founder of the [[S'tung Monastery]] in [[T'u Lung]], known posthumously by the title [[Sky Father]], had a keen interest in [[astronomy]] and left behind numerous records of comets and shooting stars that flew across the skies of [[Kara-Tur]].\n\nThe [[Starmetal Hills]] in the [[Sword Coast North]] were the subject of numerous meteor showers from the 13{{th}} to 14{{th}} centuries DR, eventually making themselves the namesake of that range of knolls.<ref>\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century DR, some sages speculated that the three large shallow basins on [[Falx]] were evidence of gigantic meteorites having struck the planet in the distant past. These same sages further speculated that such cataclysmic impacts could have altered the climate of Falx, causing the extinction of most life forms on the planet's surface.<ref>\n\nIn {{YearlinkConvert|1763|WY}}, a meteor crashed into the merchant's district of [[Uwaji]] on the island nation of [[Wa]], killing two hundred people. A [[wu jen]] by the name of [[Shiz-ti]] was later apprehended under suspicion of having caused the fallen star.\n\nSometime in the mid-14{{th}} century DR, a meteor containing a rich deposit of [[platinum]] fell into the [[Dragon Reach]] and was claimed by a group of [[aquatic dwarves]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/The Stroke of Midnight|5}}\n\nAround [[1367 DR]],{{AQ-time}} on the night that [[Adil al-Muluki]] stole the [[Seal of Suhail min Zann]] from a rotund priest outside the [[Mosque of a Thousand Fountains]] in the city of [[Muluk]], nine meteors streaked across the night sky.<ref>{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Adventure Book|3,5}}\n\nAroyund the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, across the continent of Faerûn lands far and wide were beset by tremendous lightning strikes, some of which would mark the impact points of a year long rain of meteors. Each of these meteors held within them some form of [[dragon]] egg. Worshipers of [[Bahamut]] and [[Tiamat]] received visions from their respective draconic god regarding these meteor strikes, instructing them to seek out the fallen stars.<ref>",
