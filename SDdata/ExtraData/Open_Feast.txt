'''Open Feast''' was a revelry held on the 26th of [[Mirtul]] each year by the King of [[Cormyr]]. It was known as the "open" feast because by tradition no members of the royal family attended the festival, and allowed the attendees to speak openly. Many nobles would attend such a gathering for this reason, being able to state their opinions without consequences.
