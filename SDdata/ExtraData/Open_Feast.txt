Open Feast was a revelry held on the 26th of Mirtul each year by the King of Cormyr. It was known as the "open" feast because by tradition no members of the royal family attended the festival, and allowed the attendees to speak openly. Many nobles would attend such a gathering for this reason, being able to state their opinions without consequences.
