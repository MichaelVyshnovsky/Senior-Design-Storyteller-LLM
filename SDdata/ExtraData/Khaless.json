        "mainbody": "haless was a game played by the drow of House Oblodra in Menzoberranzan.\nAround 1358 DR, the members of House Oblodra used this game to test courage.\nIn the game, Khaless, two drow would cast darkness and silence over the chasm known as Clawrift. The twin challengers would cast levitation and enter the globes. The drow who exited first would be the loser and in many cases both drow would fall to their deaths when their spells ran out.\nThe name of the game derives from the drow word, Khaless which means trust."
