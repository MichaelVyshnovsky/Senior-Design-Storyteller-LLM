A '''''spell-web''''', '''''spell web''''', or '''''spellweb''''' was one of a number of different practices, most of which involved linking multiple "hanging" [[spell]]s together, so that they would be released upon various triggers.

==Varieties==
===Cormathan Spell-Webs===
[[Cormanthyr|Cormathan]] ''spell-webs'' held spells in abeyance, waiting for a trigger.{{Cite dragon annual/1997/The magic of Myth Drannor|90-91}}{{cite book/Elminster in Myth Drannor|17-18|318-328}}

By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, [[Deluma Dauntrael]], the matriarch of the [[Dauntrael]] clan, was close enough to developing her own version of the ancient Cormathan ''spell-web''.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|79}}

''[[Arcanaweave]]s'' were self-aware ''spell-webs'' – an offshoot of Cormathan ''spell-webs'', devised by [[Jhesiyra Kestellharp]], one of [[Halaster Blackcloak]]'s many apprentices.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|47}} She eventually became an ''[[arcanaweave]]'' herself.{{cite book/Expedition to Undermountain|18}}

===Lantanna Spell-Webs===
''Spell-webs'' devised in [[Lantan]] were said to feed on the magic of [[enchanted]] objects, [[spell]]s as they were cast, and even the minds of nearby [[wizard]]s, ''[[feeblemind]]ing'' them and removing, perhaps for years, perhaps permanently, their ability to employ any magic. The ''spell-webs'' then employed the stolen sorcery to power a variety of effects; such practices were said to be amongst the many defenses that Lantan had against pirates.{{Cite polyhedron/64/The Everwinking Eye: Daily Life in Mulmaster|21}}

===Other Spell-Webs===
Other so-called ''spell-webs'' were used to protect the [[Warlock's Crypt]] where the [[Netherese]] [[lich]] [[Larloch]] dwelt: they were constructions that could spring to unleash magic upon intruders. Another Netherese lich, [[Saharel]], kept up a bespoke ''spellweb'' which handled the defenses at [[Spellgard]]. The ''spell-web'' was stable enough to endure with little trouble the [[Time of Troubles]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028235842/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_040506-06.htm| title = So Saith Ed Apr – Jun 2006| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

The two sorcerous brothers ruling [[Adaerglast]] were reputed to have looted magic from all over [[Faerûn]], and to use ''spell-webs'' to protect their castle. Those spell-webs were constructions such that triggering one spell led to a number of others to be activated in unison.{{Cite polyhedron/135/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|9}}

Two of the [[Seven Sisters]] were known to have used ''spell-webs''. Ever-grander ''spellwebs'' were woven under [[Alustriel Silverhand]]'s rule in the [[Tower of Balance]], within [[Silverymoon]], but nothing was said of their functions.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210902234545/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_020304-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Feb – Apr 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}} [[The Simbul]] kept her study copy of the ''[[Simbul's spell trigger]]'' concealed within a series of wards that included a ''spell-web''.

[[Eirhaun Sooundaeril]], a [[Zhentarim]] mage, had a functioning ''spellweb'' as of the {{YearlinkName|1357}}.{{cite web/How Wisdom Came to the Maimed Wizard}}
