        "Description": "Rather than possessing a single racial language like many creatures on [[Toril]], trolls spoke a variety of different mixed languages.{{Cite organized play/LC/Monster Mash|23}}{{Cite organized play/LC/The Quest for Fire|15}} Typified by a rather guttural speech, these tongues were mishmashes of corrupted loan words and phrases from other languages. The languages that Trollspeak typically loaned from were [[Common]], [[Daraktan]], [[Ghukliak]], [[Hobgoblin language|Hobgoblin]], and [[Giant language|Jotun]]. Trollspeak was also highly transient or regional, thus trolls from one area only had a one-in-fourth chance of understanding the Trollspeak of trolls from another area, such as the Trollspeak of the [[Troll Hills]] versus the Trollspeak of [[Thar]].",
        "Related Languages": {
            "Snow Troll": "The language spoken by [[snow troll]]s had a high-pitched, sing-song like quality to it. It was said to have over twenty different words for \"prey\", reflecting the subrace's hunting culture.",
            "Troll Hills": "For many in the [[Heartlands]], saying that one \"spoke Troll\" referred exclusively to the shared language of trolls in the [[High Moor]] and Troll Hills.Though it is not specified within the text itself that \"speaking troll\" in this context is unique to the Heartlands, this can inferred due to the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)|Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting]]'' box-set being focused primarily on that region of [[Faer√ªn]] and both locations being within that region.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"high moors\">The original text referred to the \"[[High Moors]]\", rather than the \"High Moor\". Due to the highly transient nature of Trollspeak and the High Moor being in far closer proximity to the Troll Hills, this is assumed to be an misspelling."
