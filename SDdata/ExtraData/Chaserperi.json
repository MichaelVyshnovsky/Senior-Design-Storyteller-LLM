        "mainbody": "he Chaserperi was a family of mages fostered by the Magister Maxiladanarr Torstren.\nMost Chaserperi were small, dark-haired and agile, restless, but efficient about their movements. The family in Amn had members growing somewhat broader, but none of them had become especially tall.\nPrior to Maxiladanarrs Torstren fostering during his reign as the Magister, which spanned from  to , the Chaserperi were weavers and cloth sellers of southern Amn. By , they had become \"port rats\" sellers of various things, spread across the Sword Coast and all lands north of the Calim Desert.\nAs of 1370, the most recent generation had begun to pursue broader interests, moving their business inland. \nA few Chaserperi lived instead lives of quiet study, working as scriveners in Candlekeep and in several cities of the Sword Coast. There were also some members that were fineweavers or potters.\nAll Chaserperi could smell the \"tang\" of magic, or rather, feel it somehow. Almost all of them knew some cantrips, and many of them knew more magic.\nThere were close to a hundred and seventy mages capable at least of launching a fireball, and twenty to thirty quite worthy of the name of a wizard. There were maybe a hundred children in the clan ready to learn magic by .\nThe clans heads as of  were its patriarch and matriarch, Faereldan Chaserperi and Chancereene Chaserperi. The two of them lived in an unremarkable house in Athkatla.\nChaserperi took care to become regarded as honest merchants, given the danger for a \"port rat\" that was seen as dishonest. They also avoided raising their profile, leaving themselves known mostly for being \"old, trusted money\", and a family of able people, in the know.\nThe family shared surprisingly few tales of magic internally, which included the fabled exploits of Auldo Chaserperi and Melegor Chaserperi.\n* Auldo Chaserperi\n* Chancereene Chaserperi\n* Elvrado Chaserperi\n* Faereldan Chaserperi\n* Llandur Chaserperi\n* Melegor Chaserperi\n* Ondraer Chaserperi\n* Tlaverlt Chaserperi"
