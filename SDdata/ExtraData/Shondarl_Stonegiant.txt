'''Shondarl Stonegiant''' was a [[merchant]] who lived in [[the Vast]] and worked as a locksmith and a supplier of trained dancers.

Stonegiant maintained a country house in the town of [[Maerstar]], and fled there following the chaos and disaster in his home city during the [[Time of Troubles]], [[1358 DR]], along with a number of other merchants from [[Procampur]] and [[Tsurlagol]]. However, they were harassed by looting mobs of refugees from [[Tantras]], [[Calaunt]] and even [[Mulmaster]], who'd also come through Maerstar. Stonegiant buried a hoard of coins and trade-bars in one of Maerstar's [[horse]] paddocks to protect them from the looters, but did not survive to retrieve them afterwards. The hoard was reputed to still be buried in Maerstar by [[1370 DR]].

===Notes===
* It should be noted that Shondarl was not necessarily a [[stone giant]], and more likely that Shondarl or their family was named after one. By the context of Maerstar's description, Shondarl Stonegiant likely came from either Procampur or Tsurlagol.
