The '''Master of Cobbles''' was an officer position within the government of [[Baldur's Gate]]. They were responsible for the construction and maintenance of all the city's roads and along with any other stonework that composed public buildings, save for drains, pipes and other waterways.

This officer was often the target of bribes by city contractors, making it one of the more lucrative government titles.
