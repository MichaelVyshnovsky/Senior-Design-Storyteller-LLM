        "mainbody": "''khanduq''' was a walled enclosure found within many [[Calimshan|Calishite]] towns and cities. It served as a central trade center for the marketplaces that sprung up around it. Khanduqs often included bars, inns, warehouses, guild halls, guard houses, moneychangers, or other such amenities.<ref name=EotSS-p95>",
        "Description": "Every [[sabban]] in a Calishite city had a khanduq. While basic markets surrounded the outside of a khanduq, more expensive wares such as furs and [[silk]]  were stored and sold within the khanduq's walls.<ref name=Calimport-p8>\n\nMost khanduqs had gates on opposite ends with a road between them to increase traffic through them.<ref name=EotSS-p95/> The gates were heavily guarded and would be open from sunrise till sunset.<ref name=Calimport-p75>\n\nA typical khanduq had two floors. It would have a square courtyard with a public well and troughs for animals. Roofs covered the rooms along the outer walls. There were several stalls for holding animals and several warehouse rooms for rent to merchants. The khanduq owner's house would be within the confines of the complex.<ref name=Calimport-p75/>\n\nThe second floor would have a covered balcony where guildmasters and [[pasha]]s would discuss business and overlook the shopping below. Most of the business and guild offices would be found on the second floor as well.<ref name=Calimport-p75/>",
        "History": "During the [[First Age of Calimshan]], [[caravanserai]]s were scattered over the [[Shining Sea]] region as trade between [[human]] tribes multiplied. Cities developed around these enclosed \"rest stops\". Within an urban environment, the functions of these sites evolved. For example, strong defenses were no longer needed and stabling was less important, but many of the other amenities of caravanserais &mdash; central markets, warehouses, money-changing, ''etc.'' &mdash; remained. These \"urban caravanserais\" became known as ''khanduqs''.<ref name=EotSS-p95/>",
