A '''forge priest''' was a [[dwarf]] who gained special powers from keeping alive traditions of the forge.<ref name="Dr-245-p30>{{cite dragon/245/The Heart of the Forge|30}}

==Activities==
Forge priests were charged with the traditions of the forge and blacksmithing.

==Powers==
Their traditions granted them the power to use [[forge chant]]s, a special kind of cooperative spell that could be used by any dwarf, even if they were not spellcasters at all. They also gained a slight resistance to fire.

==Structure==
All forge priests had to be inducted by another forge priest in a ''[[tempering]]'' ritual, which required a vigil at a temple to [[Moradin]]. Obviously, they were all dwarves.

==Restrictions==
It was taboo for a forge priest to casually destroy metalwork for any reason.
