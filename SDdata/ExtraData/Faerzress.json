        "mainbody": "ile:Faerzress_Infused_Minotaur.jpg|thumb|right|270px|''A [[minotaur]] using ''faerzress''.'']]\n'''''Faerzress''''' was a [[magic]]al radiation only found in the [[Underdark]], a remnant of [[High Magic]] that helped shape  the Underdark itself.<ref><ref><ref name=FRCG-p218\"> It interfered with the casting of teleportation and divination spells.\n\nAreas of high ''faerzress'' concentration would manifest physical signals, ranging from subtle shifts in temperature to visibly glowing rock formations.<ref name=FRCG-p218\"/>",
        "Etymology": "The word ''faerzress'' is composed of ''faer'' (magic) and ''Z'ress'' (to hold dominance or to remain in force), which together mean ''magic that remained''. However, its original term had ''faer'' and ''Z'ress'' inverted, which rendered the term as ''dominating magic''. That older composition was much more telling about the primary task of these emanations: to keep the [[drow]] in the Underdark.",
        "Faerzress and drow culture": "''Faerzress'' was a [[Drow language|Drow]] word, and it played a major role in [[drow]] city planning. Drow sought out areas with strong ''faerzress'' to build their cities and outposts in order to keep others from [[scrying]] their doings or teleporting inside the city. Drow also used faerzress to create magical artifacts.\n\nAfter [[1375 DR]], drow [[wizards]] and [[clerics]] noticed sparks of [[Faerie fire]] when casting a [[divination]] spell. After some investigation, the combined efforts of the wizards of [[Sshamath]] and the priestesses of [[Eilistraee]] uncovered the plan of the clerics of [[Kiaransalee]] to open a [[gate]] to the [[Negative Energy plane]] by agglutinating a massive amount of [[Voidstone]], which was augmenting the ''faerzress''. However, it was deduced that it was only affecting drow spellcasters because they had ''faerzress'' in them, which was augmented and rendered unstable by the actions of the clerics of Kiaransalee. Thus, when they used divination, they expunged part of this excess of ''faerzress'' to the point where using divination would only render a vision of faerie fire.\n\nThrough the use of a [[Selu'Kiira]],  [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] was led to believe that, in ancient times, the forces of [[Aryvandaar]] not only wiped out [[Miyeritar]], but also changed the bodies of the [[Ilythiir|Ilythiiri]], and created the ''faerzress'' to imprison them under the earth (both by preventing them from escaping by magical means, and by making them less willing to return to the surface, as the ''faerzress'' appeared to exert a calling effect on the [[drow]]).",
        "Effects on magic": "''Faerzress'' could affect magic and spellcasting in unpredictable ways, in some ways like [[wild magic]]. Although the knowledge of ''faerzress'' among surface-dwellers was sparse, it was known to mainly affect [[divination]] and [[conjuration]] spells, making [[teleport]]ing by magic in the Underdark a risky effort.\n\nSome areas in the Underdark had stronger ''faerzress'' emanations than others. For example, [[Zz'Pzora's Lair]] outside of [[Menzoberranzan]] had very strong emanations which [[Liriel Baenre]] was able to capture in the [[Windwalker (artifact)|Windwalker amulet]] to carry drow magic to the surface.\n\nIt was possible to enact rituals to alter the concentration of ''faerzress'' in an area or to affect a pocket of it, although such spells often attracted unwanted attention from denizens of the Underdark attuned to the ''faerzress''.<ref name=FRCG-p218\"/>",
        "Effects on plantlife": "Since the Underdark lacked food or light for plant life and [[fungi]], many plants and fungi that are found underground found ways to live on a diet of ''faerzress''. It was the sole food source of a plant-like life form called [[magivore]]s, which could serve as a foodsource for Underdark settlements.<ref name=FRCG-p218\"/>"
