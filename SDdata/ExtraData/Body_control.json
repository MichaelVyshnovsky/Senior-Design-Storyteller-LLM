        "mainbody": "ody control was a psionic devotion of the psychometabolism discipline that allowed the psionicist to adapt their body to hostile environments.\nThe psionicist could use this devotion to not only survive, but interact as a native life form for any environment that was hostile to their inherent form, allowing them to move unhindered within the environment without being physically harmed. Magical attacks that mimicked the harsh effects of some environments would still harm the psionicist as normal. An example would be a psionicist being harmed by a cone of cold even though they were using body control to ignore the frigid temperature of a glacier.\n* Vhondryl, a psionicist in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor"
