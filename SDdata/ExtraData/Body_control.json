        "mainbody": "'''''Body control''''' was a [[psionic]] devotion of the [[psychometabolism]] [[discipline]] that allowed the [[psionicist]] to adapt their body to hostile environments.",
        "Effects": "The psionicist could use this devotion to not only survive, but interact as a native life form for any environment that was hostile to their inherent form, allowing them to move unhindered within the environment without being physically harmed. Magical attacks that mimicked the harsh effects of some environments would still harm the psionicist as normal. An example would be a psionicist being harmed by a ''[[cone of cold]]'' even though they were using ''body control'' to ignore the frigid temperature of a glacier.",
