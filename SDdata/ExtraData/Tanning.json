Though a vital part of producing tough clothing and the fittings for all sorts of finished products, it was an intensive and rather unpleasant process.{{Cite dragon/98/Knowing what's in store|31,32}} A person that worked in the tanning industry was known as a tanner.",
        "Production": "From the raw hides sourced from a wide variety of animals (or even people), they would be scraped free of hair and flesh with specialized [[knives]] to produce a smooth uniform material. The thinner the animal's skin, the more delicate the work would become, with [[rabbit]]s requiring a wooden \"knife\" to gently prepare it. Beyond this, the cleaning and preservation of leather required the extensive use of large amounts of noxious chemicals, like [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[tannic acid]], and [[vinegar]]. The hides were soaked in [[barrel]]s full of these substances for weeks or months, with varying concentrations depending on the stage of work.\n\nMany tanneries had attached leatherworking shops, which turned the leather into finished goods like [[boots]] and [[riding tack]]. Others simply sold their product for artisans to use elsewhere.",
        "Practice": "In some areas, the professions of skinners, tanners, and leatherworkers were controlled or regulated by trade [[guild]]s, like the [[League of Skinners and Tanners]] in [[Waterdeep]], which supplied the bulk of leather used by artisans of other guilds such as the [[Saddlers' and Harness-makers' Guild]], [[Order of Cobblers and Corvisers]], and [[Order of Master Tailors, Glovers, and Mercers]].\n\nBecause of the foul smell and toxic waste produced by tanning and tawing, tanneries were almost always kept on the outskirts of towns, downriver, or entirely separated.",
        "Materials": "Materials used in the production of leather included:\n* [[Salt]], for preserving unworked hides while in storage.\n* [[Tannic acid]], for tanning, derived from woodchips, bark, and leaves, such as [[senna]].\n* [[Alum]] and [[tincal]], for tawing.\n* [[Lime (material)|Lime]], for removing hair and neutralizing [[acid]]s.\n* [[Vinegar]], or \"tanner's liquor\", for neutralizing [[alkaline]]s.\n* [[Fat]], [[fish oil]], [[beeswax]] and [[pitch]], for lubricating, sealing, and preserving.\n* [[Dye]]s, for coloring the material.\n* [[Grain alcohol]], for cleaning.",
        "Notable Tanneries": "* [[Falthryn and Daughters Tannery]], a tannery in [[Lannort]].{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Thaelon Morgyr's Map}}\n* [[Lhuin's Fine Leathers]], a tannery and leatherwork shop in [[Ashabenford]].\n* [[Old Dulwar's Leatherworks]], a tannery and leatherwork shop outside of [[Dagger Falls]].\n* [[Torpus's Tannery]], in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].\n* [[Whelanxdryn's of Elturel]], a tannery and metalworking shop that specialized in scabbards.\n* Several large tanneries were located in [[Calaunt]], contributing to the city's foul odor.<ref><ref><ref>",
