Viakoo was the capital city of an aearee empire. It was located south-west of Phwiukree, although where this corresponds to in modern times is unknown.
*  While the primordials and gods were engaged in war, the aearee founded Viakoo.
*  The lammasu massacre a thousand of the Viakoo aearee. In reaction they begin experiments on land-bound wyrms, creating the first  of the wyvern. With this new weapon the empire expands rapidly.
