'''Dead-magic zones''', collectively known as the '''legacy of [[Helm]]''', were areas of space in which [[magic]] ceased to function. They were one of the lasting effects of the [[Time of Troubles]].

==Creation==
Most dead magic zones were found where [[The Weave]] had torn apart and left a hole. The [[Church of Shar]] also developed several rituals such as the [[Rite of Unwinding]], that could artificially create dead-magic zones, some of which would continue to allow [[Shadow Weave]] magic to function.

[[Mystra]] or the [[Silver fire]] of her [[Chosen of Mystra|Chosen]] could heal the damage in the Weave caused by a dead-magic zone, though this usage of Silver Fire was draining on the Weave. As such, the act was discouraged by the goddess except in emergency situations. A ''[[wish]]'' or ''[[miracle]]'' could patch a {{SI|30|ft}} area of the damage as well.

==Effects==
Dead-magic zones were areas of anti-magic or null-magic that disabled enchantments or prevented spells from being maintained or cast. 

In [[1369 DR|the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], [[Calispar Delgorth]], working at the [[Vipers' Nest]] zone, discovered that plants grown within a dead-magic zone had magic-resistant properties. He hypothesized that such plants "soaked up" the essence of the dead-magic zone.{{Cite dungeon/75/Into the Nest of Vipers|66}}

Dead-magic zones did not seem to have an effect on [[spelljamming helm]]s, provided they were already in use when the zone was entered.

==Notable zones==

The northern quarter of the city of [[Tantras]] was a single, huge dead-magic zone of some 400 acres. It was the site of a battle between the avatars of [[Bane]] and [[Torm]] during the Time of Troubles. It became a haven to those who had offended vengeful mages.<ref>

The entire [[Anauroch|Anauroch Desert]] was covered in a dead-magic zone when the Church of [[Shar]] taught the [[Shade]]s one of their rituals for creating them. Using the ''[[Mythallar]]'' of [[Thultanthar]] to empower the ritual allowed them to create such a vast area, though the Shadow Weave and [[Psionics]] functioned normally, crippling the [[Zhentarim]] travelling the [[Black Road]] as well as the [[Phaerimm]]. The field did not extend into the [[Buried Realms]] however, so magic continued to function normally underground. Several artficial oases dried up, most Weave-powered magic items became worthless and the ecology of magical creatures (e.g. [[dragon]]s) living in the desert was drastically altered.

==Dead-magic items==
A certain [[sapphire]] radiated an anti-magic field similar to a dead-magic zone. It was kept in a specially shielded box to block its effects. [[Errtu]] gave this sapphire to a [[demon]] summoned by [[Matron Mother]] [[Yvonnel Baenre]]. When exposed, the spells protecting Yvonnel disappeared and [[Drizzt]]'s magical items temporarily lost their enchantments.<ref>

The same sapphire was again employed by Errtu when the powerful artifact, [[Crenshinibon]], was exposed to the sapphire and was damaged, at least temporarily.<ref>

Using ingredients from plants grown with a dead-magic zone in 1369 DR, Calispar Delgorth was able to concoct [[poison]]s that were resistant or immune to magical cures.
