        "mainbody": "'''avatar''' was a physical manifestation of a [[deity]] on [[Toril]].",
        "Powers": "An avatar was significantly less powerful than the deity it represented, The loss of an avatar usually did no permanent damage to a deity, as could be recorded for [[Mystra]]<ref> and [[Tiamat]]. It could, however, mean a set-back for divine plans and was always seen as an affront.<ref>\n\nDepending on a [[Deity#Types by Rank|deity's rank]], it could possibly have a number of avatars at once. Divine power also determined how long it would take a god to reform an avatar destroyed on the [[Prime Material plane|Prime]].",
        "Incarnation": "An incarnation was a mortal, lesser form of avatar derived from a manifestation. Their general temperament was the same, though they were not under their deity's direct control and could be affected by mortal weaknesses. They were also less powerful than a normal avatar, possessing only minor divine powers.\n\nBlood relatives sired by an incarnation would possess exceptional abilities, but lack any divine power. If an incarnation was ever slain, the divine spirit of a manifestation would always reform or \"reincarnate\" it within the physical body of one of these descendants.\n\nOn Toril, it was primarily the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] and [[Untheric pantheon]]s that had incarnations, Their incarnations all had innate abilities that replicated the [[spell]]s ''[[command]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[detect evil]]'', ''[[detect good]]'', ''[[detect lie]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[know alignment]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[summon minion]]'', ''[[teleport without error]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', and ''[[true seeing]]''.",
        "Relationships": "Many avatars employed in the Realms were mightier than those found in other [[crystal sphere]]s,<ref> as befitted a world with many powerful mortal individuals.<ref><ref><ref>",
        "History": "The [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]] marked an exception to many rules concerning avatars: [[Ao]] forced the full persons of all deities to walk Toril in the form of their avatars, which lead to many extraordinary events and the demise of several gods.<ref> One such event was the various incarnations of the Mulhorandi and Untheric deities falling into comas, as the god-kings attempted to regain some of their lost power by absorbing the divine fragments held by those bodies.\n\nIn the years following this Avatar Crisis, many deities invested their manifestations with increased power.<ref><ref><ref><ref><ref><ref><ref><ref group=\"note\" name=\"note1\">In 2nd edition, the ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' accessory from 1996 introduced rules for avatars up to 40th level. These were also used by its companion volumes ''[[Powers & Pantheons]]'' and ''[[Demihuman Deities]]''. Both Forgotten Realms and Core books published earlier restricted avatars to 20th or (rarely) 25th level. This lead to discrepancies for avatars appearing both before and since ''Faiths & Avatars'', and to comparatively low power for avatars appearing only before that accessory. No such development has been reported for most [[Template:Monster deities|monster deities]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note1\"/> As for the Mulhorandi deities, following the Avatar Crisis their manifestations on the Prime reunited with their divine essence in the [[Outer Planes]], for Ao had dispersed the Imaskari planar barrier that had long separated them.<ref> As a result of this reunion, [[Pharaoh]] [[Horustep III]] and all other incarnations lost the fragments of divinity that were within them, reducing them to mere mortals with divine lineage."
