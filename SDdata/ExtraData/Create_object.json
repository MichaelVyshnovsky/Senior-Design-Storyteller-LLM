        "mainbody": "'''''Create object''''' was a minor [[psionic]] devotion of the [[psychokinesis]] [[discipline]] that allowed a [[psionicist]] to assemble, to a limited degree, a material object from the air and potentially other material around them.",
        "Effects": "Items formed by ''create object'' could be of any color, shape, and texture that the psionicist desired. However, the minor devotion had certain limitations to size and weight that an object could take. An object couldn't weigh any more than {{SI|10|lb|long=yes}} and had to be able to fit within either a sphere no more than {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} in diameter, within a cylinder no more than {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} in length and {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in diameter, or a cylinder no more than {{SI|2|ft|long=yes}} in height and {{SI|6|ft|long=yes}} in diameter.\n\nA psionicist could only draw from material within a {{SI|20|yard|long=yes}} radius of them when using ''create object'', though the materials they chose for the construction of their object could be rearranged or restructured if they so happened to have ''[[molecular rearrangement]]''. For example, the combination of these two powers could allow a psionicist to form [[diamond]]s out of [[coal]] dust or a [[sword]] from mere [[iron]] ore.\n\nAny matter formed from ''create object'' was usually temporary, existing so long as the psionicist focused upon it. When a psionicist ceased to put mental energy towards maintaining an object, it would fall apart into its constituent parts.\n\nOn the rare instance when a psionicist botched using ''create object'', the item they created would contain some sort of flaw. If the use of ''create object'' outright backfired, one of the psionicist's personal belongings would be disintegrated.",
        "Prerequisite Powers": "In order to learn this power, a psion first had to possess the minor devotion ''[[telekinesis (psionic)|telekinesis]]''.",
