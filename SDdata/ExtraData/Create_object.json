        "mainbody": "Create object was a minor psionic devotion of the psychokinesis discipline that allowed a psionicist to assemble, to a limited degree, a material object from the air and potentially other material around them.\nItems formed by create object could be of any color, shape, and texture that the psionicist desired. However, the minor devotion had certain limitations to size and weight that an object could take. An object couldnt weigh any more than  and had to be able to fit within either a sphere no more than  in diameter, within a cylinder no more than  in length and  in diameter, or a cylinder no more than  in height and  in diameter.\nA psionicist could only draw from material within a  radius of them when using create object, though the materials they chose for the construction of their object could be rearranged or restructured if they so happened to have molecular rearrangement. For example, the combination of these two powers could allow a psionicist to form diamonds out of coal dust or a sword from mere iron ore.\nAny matter formed from create object was usually temporary, existing so long as the psionicist focused upon it. When a psionicist ceased to put mental energy towards maintaining an object, it would fall apart into its constituent parts.\nOn the rare instance when a psionicist botched using create object, the item they created would contain some sort of flaw. If the use of create object outright backfired, one of the psionicists personal belongings would be disintegrated.\nIn order to learn this power, a psion first had to possess the minor devotion telekinesis.\n* Ki-rin, a race of celestial creatures with psionic powers.\n* Lythlyx, a strange psionic race of eel-like creatures."
