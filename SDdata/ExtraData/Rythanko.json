It was carried by a [[Githyanki]] aboard a merchant ship on the [[Moonsea]] when the ship was captured by the [[Orcsblood]] in [[1460 DR]]. A young pirate named [[Gareth Jadaren]] took the Rythanko from the Gith and carried it to [[Mulmaster]] after he deserted his ship.\n\nGareth paid a [[mage]] to [[identify]] the Rythanko but the mage claimed it was worthless even though he knew it was very powerful. Later, [[Jandi M'baren]] used the Rythanko to create the wards on [[Jadaren Hold]].",
        "Powers": "The full extent of the Rythanko's powers are unknown but it seemed to control the pocket plane that the entity [[Fandour]] was imprisoned in and some of Fandour's power seemed to be linked to the Rythanko.  The bracelet appeared to be semi-sentient and could alter its shape to avoid detection.",
        "Appearance": "The Rythanko appears as a linked metallic bracelet with three red stones, possibly [[garnet (gem)|garnet]]s.",
