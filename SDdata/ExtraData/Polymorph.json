These effects included the Alter self spell, polymorph spells (polymorph, baleful polymorph, and polymorph any object), the shapechange spell, the wild shape druidic ability, and the alternate form special quality. Magic could cause creatures and characters to change their shapes&mdashsometimes against their will but usually to gain an advantage. Polymorphed creatures retained their own minds but had new physical forms.\nThe polymorph spell defined the general polymorph effect.\nIn common speech polymorphing was sometimes known as a \"spell-guise\".\n* Baleful polymorph\n* Polymorph other\n* Polymorph self\n* Flesh to stone\n* Stone to flesh\n* Transmute mud to rock\n* Transmute rock to mud\n* Transmute water to dust\nCategoryMagic\nCategoryTransmutation effects\non54jyspq7wxn78knxchquon5ap2kns"
