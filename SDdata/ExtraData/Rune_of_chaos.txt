[[File:Chamber of Twin Burnings.jpg|thumb|250px|''The demon prince Eltab sitting on ''Thakorsil's Seat'', surrounded by the ''runes of chaos'' created by the ''ritual of twin burnings''.'']]
A '''rune of chaos''' was a magical symbol representing [[chaos]]. There were at least nine runes of chaos.

The runes of chaos were a key part of the operation of the dread [[artifact]] ''[[Thakorsil's Seat]]''. The horrid ''[[ritual of twin burnings]]''—which involved the sacrifice, body and soul, of a good [[mage]]—created a crystal pane bearing one of the runes of chaos around the ''Seat''. With all nine runes of chaos in place, a victim trapped in the chair was eternally bound to it and enslaved to the will of its owner.
