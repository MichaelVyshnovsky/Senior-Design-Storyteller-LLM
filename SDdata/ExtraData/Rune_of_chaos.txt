thumb|250px|The demon prince Eltab sitting on Thakorsils Seat, surrounded by the runes of chaos created by the ritual of twin burnings.
A rune of chaos was a magical symbol representing chaos. There were at least nine runes of chaos.
The runes of chaos were a key part of the operation of the dread artifact Thakorsils Seat. The horrid ritual of twin burnings—which involved the sacrifice, body and soul, of a good mage—created a crystal pane bearing one of the runes of chaos around the Seat. With all nine runes of chaos in place, a victim trapped in the chair was eternally bound to it and enslaved to the will of its owner.
