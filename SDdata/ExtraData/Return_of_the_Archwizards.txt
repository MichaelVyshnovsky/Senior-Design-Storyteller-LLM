The '''Return of the Archwizards''' is a trilogy of novels by [[Troy Denning]] centered around the [[elf]] [[Galaeron Nihmedu]], an [[Evereskan tomb guardian]].

==The Summoning==

{{Main|The Summoning}}
Time Frame: [[1371 DR]] - [[1372 DR]]
{{quote|From the depths of the [[Demiplane of Shadow]] comes a new magic so mysterious it confounds even the [[Chosen of Mystra]]. 

From beneath the dune seas of [[Anauroch]] escapes one of [[Toril]]'s most powerful and ancient evils - the [[phaerimm]]. 

From [[Evereska]], the last elven refuge on Faerûn, comes word of invasion. 

From nowhere appears a group of enigmatic sorcerers determined to destroy the phaerimm and save Evereska... for purposes known only to themselves. 

}}
The floating city of [[Shade (city)|Shade]] escaped the fall of the mighty Empire of [[Netheril]]. The city and the powerful archwizards who rule it have been hiding in the frightening and mysterious demiplane of shadow for centuries. In The Summoning, the time has come for the floating city to return to the world of Faerûn and for the evil archwizards to begin an invasion that could enslave the free citizens of the Realms world! 

==The Siege==

{{Main|The Siege (Return of the Archwizards)}}
Time Frame: 1372 DR
{{quote|For Evereska, the last elven refuge on Faerûn, its battle for survival. 

For the Chosen of Mystra, its potent rival for their goddess's dominion over magic. 

For the human realms of Faerûn, its permanent shift in the balance of power. 

For the lost race of powerful archwizards, it's a flying mountain they call home. 

}}
The world-spanning schemes of Shade begin to take shape, along with a new empire in the heart of the Great Desert. 

The second book highlights one of the most intriguing developments in the Forgotten Realms setting: the return of powerful and mysterious villains who will affect the entire balance of power on Toril.

==The Sorcerer==

{{Main|The Sorcerer}}
Time Frame: 1372 DR
{{quote|In the blasted ruins of Tilverton, demons stalk the shadows. 

In Evereska and Cormyr, alliances crumble. 

In the sun-baked desert of Anauroch, an empire of darkness is established. 

In the soul of a tortured elf, the future is decided. 

}}
[[Tilverton]] is no more. Phaerimm surround Evereska. The [[High Ice]] is melting. Floods sweep through Anauroch. [[Elminster]] is still nowhere to be found. The greatest heroes of Faerûn are held at bay, and a flying city has taken up permanent residence in a world on the brink of destruction.
