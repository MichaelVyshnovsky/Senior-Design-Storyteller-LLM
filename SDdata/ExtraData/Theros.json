        "Cosmography": {
            "Calendar": "The major calendar system of Theros, the '''Meletian calendar''', marked each day with the beginning of a new moon. Under this calendar, the people of Theros separated each year into twelve months that alternated between consisting of twenty-nine to thirty days, though once every three years the calendar would include a thirteen month.<ref>"
        },
        "History": "History was a complex thing on Theros as, compared to other worlds, history became a matter of myth far more quickly, with details distilling into generalities, vagueness, and morals. It was often impossible for mortals to distinguish between the historical facts and myths surrounding the activities of their deities on the mortal world.\n\nIn the late 1480s [[DR]], a channeling of power from across the planes occurred in the [[Icewind Dale]] region of [[Toril]], potentially due to the [[Everlasting Rime]] or some other meddling on the goddess [[Auril]]'s part. This meddling with planar magic caused some creatures from other worlds to be dragged into Icewind Dale. This included a [[leonin]] known as [[Yanna]], who was watching her plane's sun set over Oreskos when she was transported. While chasing after a pack of [[satyr]]s in that region, she ran into the [[cleric]] [[Celeste]] and explained her situation.<ref>",
        "Locations": {
            "Oreskos": "A vast dry, grassland valley nestled between two mountains. It was the homeland of the leonins."
        },
        "Inhabitants": "Some multiversal creatures that could be found on this plane included [[amphisbaena]], [[basilisk]]s (but only with four legs), [[catoblepas]], [[cyclopes]], [[blue dragon|blue]] and [[red dragon]]s, [[medusa]]e, [[night hag]]s, [[sphinx]]es, [[unicorn]]s,<ref> [[harpies]], and [[hippocampi]].<ref> There also existed satyrs on this plane that, unlike other satyrs found throughout the multiverse, were a species that exhibited both males and females.\n\nOne of the uniquely distinct creatures of this plane were leonins, a race of [[lion]]-like [[humanoid]]s that inhabited the golden plain of Oreskos, living there in either cave dens or mobile [[tent]] cities. They lived in Oreskos alongside [[gazelle]]s, [[griffin]]s, and lean lions.\n\nMuch like on the plane of Olympus,<ref> this world was noted for having [[adventurer]]s who went above and beyond to become legendary heroes, risking everything for glory and not fading into the background.",
        "Trivia": "*Elminster was one of the few (perhaps even only) [[Faer√ªn]]ians to be aware of Theros's existence and knew a great deal about the plane.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-02-27 - Elminster and Other Settings}}",
