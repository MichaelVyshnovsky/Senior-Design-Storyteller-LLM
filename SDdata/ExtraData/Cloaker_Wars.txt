The Cloaker Wars occurred around  when Taark Shanats dwarves (migrating west from Bhaerynden) engaged the inhabitants of Rringlor Noroth. This included four blue dragons occupying the Rift of Dhalnadar who were all slain by Taark, bringing a victory for the dwarves. Alatorin and its famous Brightaxe Hall was established on this site. The founding of Alatorin is regarded by shield dwarves as the start of the First Great Age of Shanatar.
The skulls of the four dragons were brought together with a throne that emerged from the floor of the cavern (which was by then Brightaxe Hall), by a deity who was probably Dumathoin, and this created the Wyrmskull Throne.
