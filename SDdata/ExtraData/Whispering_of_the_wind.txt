The '''whispering of the wind''' was a special ritual used by [[sha'ir]]s to enhance their [[gen]]'s hearing ability.

==Preparation==
All rituals that enhanced a gen's hearing required a set of earrings studded with valuable gems worth at least 500 [[dinar]]s. This ritual lasted for 16 hours.

Once the ritual was complete the gen was able to hear any conversation that they could see taking place, including those were the participants used magic to mask their voices.
