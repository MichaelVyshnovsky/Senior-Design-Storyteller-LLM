The kiss of Isis was a special magical power that could be bestowed by Isis, the Lady of All Love within the Mulhorandi pantheon.
Isis would sometimes appear to brave heroes and heroines who faced terrible danger while performing quests for her. She would kiss the recipient on the cheek during the heat of fierce battle, bestowing special powers upon her champion. The recipient was completely immune to physical harm from whatever type of weapon posed the greatest risk to them for the next forty minutes. Once the blessing expired a permanent mark showing Isis symbol would remain where the recipient was kissed.
