The Neverwinter Saga is a tetralogy of novels written by R.A. Salvatore that feature Drizzt DoUrden as the main protagonist. They are set around the fourth-edition events involving Neverwinter. The tetralogy begins with Gauntlgrym, which begins twenty-four years after the events of The Ghost King and covers the time period until 1462 DR. (Gauntlgrym is also the twentieth book concerning  Drizzt DoUrden.) The saga continues with Neverwinter, Charons Claw, and The Last Threshold. This tetralogy is preceded by the Transitions series. The first novel in The Sundering series, The Companions, picks up immediately where The Last Threshold ends.
