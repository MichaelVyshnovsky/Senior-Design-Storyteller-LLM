'''Hire-coaches''' were two-seat coaches with drivers that were used as hired transportation of small groups of passengers to customized locations. They were part of the public transportation system of [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
Waterdhavian hire-coaches were comfortable, two-wheeled black vehicles. They could seat two passengers comfortably, but could hold a maximum of four. The driver sat on an elevated seat located at the carriage's rear, commanding the [[horse]] through long reigns and a short [[whip]] mounted on a [[rod]].

Fares were always negotiated and paid in advance, rarely exceeding 6 [[Shard (coin)|shard]]s.

During winter, fewer hire-coaches remained in service, but the [[Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen]], the [[Wheelwrights' Guild]], and the [[Wagon-makers' and Coach Builders' Guild]] worked together to convert some hire-coaches into [[sledge]]s, so that they remained fully operational throughout the harshest parts of the season.

==Rumors & Legends==
Hire-coach drivers occasionally found amusement when tourists, unaccustomed to the ease of travel between wards of Waterdeep, asked for rides across adjacent wards that could be accessed by simply crossing the street.
