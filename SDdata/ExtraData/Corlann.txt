"Corlann" was an official title of the nation of Tethyr. A corlann maintained the quarters of her or his lord. For example, the king and queen of Tethyr had a corlann for themselves and a separate corlann for the prince and princesses. Lesser corlanns were put in charge of other rooms in the palace, such as the court corlann, who maintained the throne room and other ceremonial chambers.
Corlanns were always chosen from among the young nobles of the land. They were subservient to farsanns.
