        "mainbody": "'''Dawn Age''', also known as the '''Age of Dawn''', the '''Time of Dragons''', or the '''Time of Giants''', was a period lasting from {{Yearlink|-30000}} to {{Yearlink|-24000}}, when the powerful empires of the [[creator race]]s disappeared from the face of [[Toril]] and their land was occupied by [[giant]]s and [[dragons]] far more powerful than those of the [[Present Age]]. It was a time of constant war for land in [[Faerûn]], that led to the creation of great kingdoms and empires.\n\nScholars believe the Dawn Age began circa −30,000 DR, when dragons launched devastating attacks against the dominant [[Aearee]] Empires throughout the land, air, and underground, creating the first [[flight of dragons]], destroying those nations completely. They also battled against giants over territory, forcing giantkind to yield their lands and flee to the north. Individual dragons and dragon clans came to rule large swaths of territory and battled with their rivals not only for dominion of those lands, Those wars, known as the [[Draco Holy Wars]], led the race to near extinction.\n\nDuring that time, the \"lesser\" races (those of primitive [[human]]s and other [[demihuman]]s) were enslaved by the dragon lords. Although some believe the [[metallic dragon]]s were less brutal masters than the [[chromatic dragon|chromatics]], a few metallics believe this was not the case.\n\nThe Dawn Age came to an end after the first [[Rage of Dragons]] had devastated the dragons' civilizations, and [[Elf|elves]] began to build their first empires in Faerûn, starting the age known as the [[First Flowering]].",
        "Timeline": ";c. {{Yearlink|-30000}}\n* '''The Time of Dragons:''' The first dragons begin spreading across Faerûn. They soon establish the realms of [[Argissthilliax]], [[Caesinmalsvir]], [[Darastriverthicha]] and [[Tharkrixghontix]].\n* Fall of the [[Aearee]] Empires. Led by the powerful dragon general [[Nagamat]], the dragons destroyed the empires of the avians.\n* The great giant [[god]] [[Annam All-Father]] marries [[Othea]], a lesser [[demigod]]dess of [[Toril]]. Their union produces eight terrestrial children. The giant realms of [[Ostoria]], [[Darchar]], [[Grunfesting]], [[Helligheim]], [[Nedeheim]] and [[Rangfjell]] are founded by Annam and his sons.\n*[[Araushnee]] is banished from the [[elven pantheon]] and cast into the [[Abyss]]. Her son [[Vhaeraun]] (who was also banished) and daughter [[Eilistraee]] (who chose exile) start wandering on Toril. Araushnee makes a new home for herself named the [[Demonweb Pits]] and becomes the demon-goddess [[Lolth]].\n\n;c. {{Yearlink|-29500}}\n* Within a few centuries of their arrival on Faerûn, after some of the dragons reached maturity, the giants recognized the great reptiles as powerful and cunning interlopers who threatened their very existence. Soon open warfare rages between giant and dragonkind with the rich resources of Faerûn awaiting the victor.\n* The [[Draco Holy Wars]] begin when religious factions among dragons began to fight over their different philosophies. The most violent conflicts were those fought among the followers of [[Asgorath]].\n*The [[Dragonfall War]] begins when followers of [[Bahamut|Xymor]] kill [[Nagamat]], sparking the war between the followers Bahamut and [[Tiamat]] which continues unabated in the present day.\n* While dragons and giants battled, members of the smaller humanoid races began to carve out their own civilizations.\n\n;c. {{Yearlink|-28000}}\n* [[Ostoria|The Colossal Kingdom]] reaches its height, stretching across [[Faerûn]] from the [[Cold Lands]] to the [[Vilhon Reach]].\n\n;c. {{Yearlink|-27000}}\n* Trying to undermine dragon rule, the [[Fey]] opened [[Gate|planar gates]] to allow the first [[elves]] to immigrate to Toril. Although most elves were content to remain in small scattered tribes, one group of [[Dark elf|dark elves]] known as the [[Ilythiiri]] negotiated with dragons to allow them to carve out a small kingdom in the south.\n\n;{{Yearlink|-26000}} to {{Yearlink|-25000}}\n* '''[[The Thousand Year War]]:''' An avatar of [[Garyx]] led [[red dragon]]s to invade Ostoria. Eventually all of dragonkind was drawn into the conflict.\n\n;c. {{Yearlink|-26000}}\n* Othea, mother of giantkind, pursues a series of unsatisfying affairs with various powers such as [[Vaprak]], father of the ogre race.\n* Draconic philosophers came to the conclusion that religious fighting was wasteful and that gods who allowed such behavior were not worthy of their worship. This started the dragon's apathy toward their gods, which lasted for thousands of years.\n\n;c. {{Yearlink|-25500}}\n* Othea begins an affair with [[Ulutiu]], a minor sea god of the Savage Frontier. The union of Othea and Ulutiu ultimately produces four races: [[firbolg]], [[verbeeg]], [[voadkyn]], and [[fomorian]].\n\n;c. {{Yearlink|-25100}}\n* [[Durothil (prince)|Durothil]] took a [[silver dragon]] mount and became the first known dragonrider.\n* Elf survivors of the Kingdom of [[Tintageer]] (a realm of [[Feywild|Faerie]]) summon the power of elvish [[High Magic]] and escape from Faerie to Toril, and found the first elven nation on Faerûn.\n* The elves from Tintageer defeat the great [[red dragon|red wyrm]] [[Mahatnartorian]], Master of the Mountains, although Durothil also died in the battle.\n\n;c. {{Yearlink|-25000}}\n* [[Ostoria]] reaches a truce with dragonkind and the Reign of Giants comes to an end. Ostoria has shrunk to only a shadow of its former self. The Colossal Kingdom now occupies only the northernmost edge of Faerûn (present day [[Great Glacier]] and the [[Cold Lands]]).\n* Draconic legends first speak of [[Ironfang Keep]], a stronghold built on the cliffs of the White River, overlooking the [[Moonsea|Dragons’ Sea]].\n* '''First [[Rage of Dragons]]:''' Elves created the ''[[Dracorage mythal]]'' in a citadel in the northernmost reaches of Toril, tying it to the appearance of the [[King-Killer Star]]. This powerful magic incited dragons across Faerûn to madness and mindless destruction, turning them against each other and even against their offspring.\n\n;c. {{Yearlink|-24500}}\n* Legends tell that either, Tiamat or the [[green dragon]] [[Caesinsjach]], created the first of the [[dragonspawn]], [[Kurtulmak]]. Soon afterwards, new kinds of dragonspawn began to appear, among them the [[kobold]]s and the [[urd]]s.\n* Kobolds from [[Darastrixhurthi]] discovered [[Garl Glittergold]]'s gem caves, where the god had stored the soul-gems that contained the souls of the [[gnome|gnomish]] race. The kobolds enslaved the gnomes.\n* '''Destruction of Darastriverthicha:''' Dragons affected by a Rage destroyed the dragon realm of Darastriverthicha.\n* '''Destruction of Darastrixhurti:''' Garl Glittergold rescued the gnomes while the dragons attacked Darastriverthicha, and then destroyed Darastrixhurti, killing all the kobolds living there and creating the [[Hidden Lake]]. Seeking to compensate and protect the kobold and urd races, Asgorath elevated Kurtulmak and [[Kuraulyek]] to godhood.\n\n;c. {{Yearlink|-24000}}\n*'''End of the Time of Dragons:''' Desperate, a few of the remaining dragon lords try to destroy the ''Dracorage mythal''. Brave [[avariel]] defenders sacrifice their lives to protect it, and the dragons are unable to stop the magic fueling the Rage. The avariel race is almost wiped out during this battle.\n* The [[great wyrm]]s of the southern lands continuously assault the cities of [[Mhairshaulk]], causing the [[yuan-ti]] realm to fall.\n*[[Lolth]]'s attention is drawn to [[Toril]] for the first time in history, due to the elf [[Kethryllia Amarillis]] fighting the demon [[Haeshkarr]] in the [[Demonweb Pits]]. The Spider Queen begins to seduce [[dark elves]] and takes [[Ka'Narlist]] as her consort.\n* [[Occidian]] is sacked by a horde of [[orc]]s led by Haeshkarr, which then attacks [[Sharlarion]]. The invaders are defeated by the elves at great cost."
