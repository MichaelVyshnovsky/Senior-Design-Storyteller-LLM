        "mainbody": "'''Code of Crimmor''' described the various rules and laws that determined which activities were permitted or forbidden in the [[Amn]]ian city of [[Crimmor]].{{Cite dragon/334/Crimmor: City of Caravans|22-34}}\n\n{{quote|''Crimmor's laws are whatever the mayor says they are, and he speaks differently when the accused is wealthy than he does when a prisoner has few coins.''|\nCrimman rumor}}",
        "Law Enforcement": "Several organizations made sure the Code was respected and the inhabitants were kept safe:\n* The '''[[Crimmor Guard]]''', strong of 500 combatants, whose patrols watched over the streets of the city.\n* The '''Bargemen''', who patrolled the [[Alandor River]], the westbound [[River Road (Amn)|River Road]], and the docks.\n* The '''[[Shadow Thieves]]''' guild, which regulated criminal activities in the city and enforced a strict no-theft policy.",
        "Judgement": "[[File:Crimmor forgery symbol.png|thumb|130px|''The symbol used to brand criminals convicted of forgery.'']]\nThere where no jury in Crimmor, but six ''Suziers'' ({{Pronounce|SOO|zeer}}) of the [[Thaeldorn]] who served as judges. Upon breaching the code, an offender would be brought before a Suzier or before the Mayor, who would decide of their punishment. This process was swift: an offender would usually be brought before a magistrate on the same day they were apprehended, or before noon if they were caught at night. On the rare occasion where more information was necessary, such as finding witnesses, the Suzier could decide to keep a prisoner in custody up to three days. \n\nAll trials were held publicly, and accused persons could speak freely to plead their cause.",
        "Reputation": "Some Suziers were known to have more patience than others, thus pleading offenders had to be careful not to hurt their cause. The mayor was said to be more lenient towards wealthy accused&mdash;which was sometimes true&mdash;but was overall recognized as a fair-minded and well-meaning individual, who truly wanted the best for the town and its inhabitants.",
        "Citizenship": "Some crimes were punished differently if they impacted a citizen or a visitor. In Crimmor, someone was considered a ''citizen'' if they owned land, paid rent, or resided in the city since at least one season.",
        "Punishment": {
            "Branding": "Branding with a hot iron was usually combined with other punishment, and was reserved for very specific crimes.",
            "Edicts": "An edict was a public decree published by the Mayor, which was posted on all the city gates and on the doors of the Thaeldorn. Those decrees were proclaimed aloud when posted, and usually forbade a convicted person from doing something specific&mdash;such as repeating their crime. Some decree had more impact, and could for example forbid someone from taking part in a line of business. Violating an edict would result in further punishment, such as paying a fine and doing manual work.",
            "Fines and damages": "Fines were paid to the Thaeldorn, as opposed to damages which were paid to the victim or their family. In the convicted criminal was unable to pay a fine or damages, their property would be seized and the remaining amount would be converted to hard labor until the value of the work satisfied the court debt.",
            "Flogging": "Flogging was always done using a drover's [[whip]] on the prisoner's back, with the convicted stripped to the waist and wrist-manacled to restraints. To add to the humiliation, it was usually done in taverns as a form of entertainment. A patrol from the [[Crimmor Guard]] was always present during flogging to ensure the prisoner wouldn't be mistreated by the spectators.",
            "Hard Labor": "During hard labor prisoners wore leg-shackles and had to perform physically exhausting tasks such as repairing the streets and city walls, or dredging the river.",
            "Manual Work": "Prisoners sentenced to manual work didn't have to wear shackles. They would be required to perform simple tasks such as replacing wall-mortar, mending roofs and chimneys, clearing snow and ice during winter, or emptying chamberpots."

        "Laws": {
            "Spellcasting": "Crimmor had a set of laws regarding the practice of [[magic|the Art]]. The laws specifically defined \"harmful spellcasting\" as any magic that would cause damage to a person or property, cause an immediate accident, or push a person to suicide. The cause could be indirect, such as a [[fear]] spell causing a [[horse]] to run down a street and trample a bystander, or some [[enchantment]] magic causing a victim to believe themselves afflicted by a painful and inescapable condition and consequently ending their life .\n*'''Harmful public spellcasting''' was usually punished by a fine and damages to be paid to the victim, then manual work for up to a [[tenday]]. If the convicted wasn't a citizen, they would also be banned from the city for one year.\n*'''Harmful spellcasting targeting law enforcement''' such as members of the Guard, Bargemen, the Mayor, or any Thaeldorn official was punishable by death on the spot, without requiring a judgement. Exception could be made with prior permission from a high-ranking official.\n*'''Spellcasting in court'''&mdash;harmful or otherwise,&mdash; was punished by a fine and flogging, a tenday of imprisonment in the dungeon, and damages if applicable. An exception was made if the spellcasting was explicitly authorized by the Mayor or the presiding Suzier."
        },
        "Rumors": "According to [[Volothamp Geddarm]], a punishment called '''hookfingers''' was reserved for artists, forgers, scribes, and clerks who had offended prominent families."
