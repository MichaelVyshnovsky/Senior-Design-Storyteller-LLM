        "History": "During the 1340s [[DR]], the position was held by [[Szchulan Darkoon]], who was in open conflict with the transformed branch of the faith based in [[Zhentil Keep]], headed by [[Fzoul Chembryl]].\n\nThe two outlooks in faith clashed over the saturation of the church with [[mage]]s, although dogma and the rivalry between Zhentil Keep and Mulmaster played a part as well. Similar to the clash with [[Hillsfar]], this did much to keep the [[Moonsea]] area free from tyranny.\n\nFor a time, there was an orthodox temple in Zhentil Keep, known as the [[Dark Shrine]], headed by a High Inquisitor. However, post-[[Godswar]], it was a splinter church openly worshiping [[Cyric]].\n\nAfter the [[Time of Troubles]], the High Imperceptor was preparing to convert the church to the open worship of Cyric."
