Similar to the clash with Hillsfar, this did much to keep the Moonsea area free from tyranny.\nFor a time, there was an orthodox temple in Zhentil Keep, known as the Dark Shrine, headed by a High Inquisitor. However, post-Godswar, it was a splinter church openly worshiping Cyric.\nAfter the Time of Troubles, the High Imperceptor was preparing to convert the church to the open worship of Cyric."
