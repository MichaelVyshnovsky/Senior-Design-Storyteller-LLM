==Description==
Halruaan children capable of casting basic spells would attempt to mimic each other when casting the ''[[dancing lights]]'' spell. One participant would create dancing lights, and another would attempt to mimic the movements of the first set of lights.

It was a common site in many Halruaan towns to see children running down the streets playing this game.
