Subterranean spiders were spiders that dwelt underground.
 Flying spider A large species of spider that uniquely had translucent, cobweb-like wings.
 Hairy spider  A vicious spider that tended to swarm on attackers.
 Hunting spider A giant species of spider that was related to flying spiders, exhibiting the same sort of gossamer wings.
 Sword spider  A large, dangerous spider with blade-like legs.
Subterranean spiders were particularly common in drow areas of the Underdark, where they dwelt in relative safety due to many drows reverence for spiders as creatures sacred to their goddess Lolth.
