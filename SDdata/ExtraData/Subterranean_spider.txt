'''Subterranean spiders''' were [[spider]]s that dwelt underground.

==Varieties==
; [[Flying spider]]: A large species of spider that uniquely had translucent, cobweb-like wings.
; [[Hairy spider]] : A vicious spider that tended to swarm on attackers.
; [[Hunting spider]]: A giant species of spider that was related to flying spiders, exhibiting the same sort of gossamer wings.
; [[Sword spider]] : A large, dangerous spider with blade-like legs.

==Locations==
Subterranean spiders were particularly common in [[drow]] areas of the [[Underdark]], where they dwelt in relative safety due to many drow's reverence for spiders as creatures sacred to their goddess [[Lolth]].
