| query      = This is from Elminster in Myth Drannor, and correct me if I’m wrong but Waterdeep didn’t exist during this time. I believe this is 240 DR, or about there. Waterdeep didn’t become known as such for several centuries and at the time only Halastar’s Hold was in the area I believe

| answer     = That scene is set in 242 DR. The deepwater harbor was already known as "Waterdeep" and ship captains used it and its beach (now the shores of Dock Ward) for careening and repairing their damaged ships in the lee of Mount Waterdeep (which already bore that name in Common). The permanent settlement of the Hold, which went through various names (Nimoar's Hold is the best-known one, but that particular moniker came along about 600 years later) wasn't known as Waterdeep, but the careening beach (used by sailors to trade with each other and shore traders selling them food, as they made their repairs, which could often take several tendays) WAS known as Waterdeep. That's where the name the later city was given came from. All of this is in my original turnover documents, but TSR only published relevant bits and pieces of them, not a coherent "everything."
