'''Constructs''' were either animated objects or any type of artificially constructed creatures. Most constructs were non-intelligent automatons with neither a soul nor a purpose beyond service to their creator.

Because few constructs were truly alive, usually operated only by a "spark" of life, most were immune to attacks that targeted the living. These "dead" constructs possessed [[low-light vision]] and [[darkvision]] and were immune to mind-altering, [[poison]], sleep, [[paralysis]], stunning, [[disease]]-related, and death effects. Nor did these constructs require sleep or have any metabolic activities, such as eating or breathing. The major exception to this rule were [[living construct]]s, which included [[warforged]].
