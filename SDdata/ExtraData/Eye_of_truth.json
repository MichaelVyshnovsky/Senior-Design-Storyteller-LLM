        "mainbody": "he eye of truth was a special ritual used by shairs to enhance their gens vision.\nThe shair needed to provide a pair of rubies worth at least 300 dinars each. The eye of truth ritual took 24 hours to complete.\nIf successful this ritual granted the gen the permanent ability to see through magical illusions. The chance of a gen being able to see through an illusion increased based upon how powerful their shair was during the ritual."
