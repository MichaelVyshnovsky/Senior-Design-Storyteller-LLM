'''Helligbror''' (meaning "'''Holy Brother'''" in [[Giant language|Jotun]]) was a [[firbolg]] clan in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Like many firbolg clans, Helligbror required its members to carry a written form of "the code" (the guiding principles of the firbolgs) on their person. What made Helligbror stand out from other clans that required this, was their tradition of having this writing take the form of a [[tattoo]] made on their members' chests using red [[dye]].
