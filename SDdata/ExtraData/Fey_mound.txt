'''Fey mounds''' were hidden burial barrows of wild [[fey]], which often contained treasures buried with the fey. The soil from fey mounds was thought to be [[magical]], hallowed as if effected by the ''[[hallow]]'' [[spell]], and displayed additional effects such as ''[[confusion]]'' or ''[[hallucinatory terrain]]''. Because of this, individuals highly attuned to magic could sometimes sense a mound's presence and some used them in [[ritual]]s to increase the fertility of fields.

Mounds were often protected by [[Illusion domain|illusionary]] magic which could [[Charm person|charm]] trespassers or cause them to fall [[Sleep|asleep]].  Living fey zealously guarded mounds and punished those who disturbed their kinsmens' eternal rest.
