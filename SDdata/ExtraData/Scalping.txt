* One of the minor [[matron mother]]s of [[Menzoberranzan]] was said to have routinely scalped her patrons when she tired of them. She came to accumulate a collection of scalps, whose hair was woven and flesh was tanned & sewn together, until they became a macabre decorative wall hanging.
* Some committed this heinous act against [[hybsil]]s in order to obtain their antlers, due to their alleged magical properties and the difficulty of obtaining naturally shed hybsil antlers.
* Some [[quaggoth]]s would commit this act against their sworn enemy, [[drow]], as there were instances of war leaders hanging a collection of them from their [[greataxe]]s.
* [[Renal Bloodscalp]], a master [[thief]] and member of the [[Shadow Thieves]], received his nickname as a result of his habit of scalping his [[assassin]]ation targets and leaving them behind at the scene of the crime.<ref>

==History==
The act of scalping was known on [[Toril]] as far back as the [[Netherese Empire]], as the [[Rengarth]] [[barbarian]]s would commit the act upon their enemies.<ref>

In the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], this tortuous act was committed by some in the [[Sword Coast]] upon [[bandit]]s, such as members of the [[mercenary]] company [[Chill]]. Some [[half-ogre]]s in the [[Calim Desert]] committed scalping, stringing their victims' scalps around the heads of their [[spear]]s.<ref> And some [[alchemist]]s within [[Zhentil Keep]] around this time were known to exclusively pay for hybsil antlers that were still attached to their scalp, believing this assured their magical efficacy.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, officer [[Jessa Vai]] of the [[Flaming Fist]] offered to pay the [[adventurer]] [[Gorion's Ward]] a bounty of 50 [[gold piece]]s per bandit scalp they gave to her while she stayed in [[Beregost]].

Around the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, in the land of [[Turmish]] a group of mercenaries lead by [[Druz Talimsir]] traveled into the forest near [[Evenstar Lake]] and scalped a number of [[wolves]] for a bounty. Their corpses were soon after discovered by the [[druid]] [[Haarn Brightoak]], who tracked down and confronted the mercenaries, demanding they hand over their bag of scalps.
