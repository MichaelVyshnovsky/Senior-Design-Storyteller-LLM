        "mainbody": "The evocation school of magic included spells that manipulated energy or tapped an unseen source of power in order to produce a desired end. In effect, they created something out of nothing. Many of these spells produced spectacular effects, and evocation spells could deal large amounts of damage. Many iconic offensive spells such as magic missile, lightning bolt and  fireball were of the evocation school. The evocation school had no subschools. Other spells were channel energy such as positive energy to heal wounds. A wizard who specialized in evocation was known as an evoker."
