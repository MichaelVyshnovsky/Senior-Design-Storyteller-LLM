Bore worms were a small number of large constructs developed in the late-15 century DR by master artificers of the Church of Gond in imitation of the famous bore worm, a far more gargantuan construct that was created long ago by the "Metal Mage" Trobriand.
These constructs were considered by Gondsmen to be suitable for use as mounts.
Gondar clerics delved deep into the bowels of Undermountain in the 15 century DR, bringing back with them parts from Trobriands Graveyard that allowed members of their church to make smaller imitations of the bore worm.
