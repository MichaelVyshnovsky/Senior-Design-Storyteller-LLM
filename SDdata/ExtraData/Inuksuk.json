        "mainbody": "Inuksuk''' was a technique for hunting [[caribou]] employed by the [[Angulutiun]] and the [[Iulutiun]] of the [[Great Glacier]].",
        "Description": "Upon discovering a grazing herd, the hunting party quietly constructed an inuksuk. An inuksuk was a series of snowmen standing at approximately {{SI|2|ft|c|long=yes}} in height and spaced roughly {{SI|3|ft|c|long=yes}} apart. Once assembled, the inuksuk took on the form of a V-shape, with each arm of the V extending approximately {{SI|100|yd|long=yes}}.\n\nThe majority of the hunters positioned themselves at the convergence point of the V, while a select few stealthily maneuvered to the open end of the formation. With everyone in their designated spots, the hunters positioned at the open end unleashed piercing shrieks and screams, propelling the caribou towards the converging point of the V. There, they are greeted with a relentless barrage of [[arrow]]s.",
        "Usage": "The inuksuk technique for hunting caribou was originally developed by the Angulutiuns, although they seldom employed it themselves. However, it was frequently used by the Iulutiuns."
