A Shield of the High One was an honorary title granted to worshipers of Azuth who served the church by either destroying a magical monstrosity or imbalance.
These individuals were given a minor magic item as a reward as well as a secret pass phrase that would grant them magical healing, small loans, and other forms of aid from any shrine or temple dedicated to Azuth.
