The earliest mythals were created by a circle of [[elf|elven]]{{fact}} [[High Mage]]s. Mythals could permanently alter the [[Weave]] to create an area wherein the normal rules of magic no longer applied. A typical mythal prevented certain [[Magic#Schools|schools of magic]] from being employed while empowering others. It could restrict access to the warded area to certain classes of beings. For example, [[Silverymoon]]'s mythal excluded evil [[dragons]]. Creation of a mythal sometimes required the willing sacrifice of the lead caster's life, a result that led to the first mythal being named after its creator. In addition, many mythal spells corroded over time, and if not maintained could become corrupted. This occurred in [[Myth Drannor]] and resulted in the state of that city until [[1374 DR]].{{Fact}}\n\n{{quote|The Mythal was woven in the Year of Soaring Stars. The city's greatest wizards, most of them elves, came together to lay the Mythal. Working cooperatively, they wove a spell greater than the sum of its casters. Each chose a special power to infuse into the mantle, and each gave some of his or her life to engender it.|''[[Anorrweyn Evensong]] speaks of the creation of the mythal of Myth Drannor''}}",
        "History": {
            "Mythal Definitions": "While any [[epic magic]] \"field or ward\" could be considered a ''mythal'' the differences were often in semantics or traditions, but scholars often used the following distinctions to describe various ''mythals'':\n* '''High Mythal''' or '''True Mythal''': The first, great elven mythals.\n* '''Wizard Mythal'''<ref>: Those mythals created later but with similar power and often by/including non-elves.\n* '''House Mythal''': A minor mythal that covered a building.{{Cite dragon/275/The New Adventures of Volo: The Crumbling Stair|93}}\n\nPart of the confusion came from the fact that, prior to [[Mystra's Ban]], mythals could be created by both high-level spells and [[epic magic]]. After Mystra's Ban, only the epic magic option remained."
