Essentially, in it, he claimed that, as shown on Mystras holy symbol, magic was born between the stars, with the stars themselves being the known points or schools of magic, and that the space between contained far more secret magical knowledge that Mystra would only reveal to the most promising.\nFull of religious iconography and symbology, the book was very difficult to follow, even incomprehensible, being as it was written by a madman. In fact, Starweaver Fembrys was a false priest, a cleric of Shar who employed the Shadow Weave.\nIt was a large tome bound in black leather, with the cover bearing an illustration of seven stars.\nCategoryBooks (in-universe)\nCategoryReligious works\nCategoryItems from the Temple of Mystra\nCategoryItems from Wheloon\nCategoryItems from Cormyr\nCategoryItems from Interior Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nCategoryItems from the Eastern Heartlands\nrwgww1fvy8v9fnh8nr5ng4t9d5b1fk3"
