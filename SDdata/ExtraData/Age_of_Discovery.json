        "mainbody": "The Age of Discovery was a period of the history of Netheril lasting from  to .\nThe age started with the discovery of chardalyns. Elorian, an arcanist of Netheril, found these crystals while examining some rocks. After the discovery, the Netherese Empire started excessive mining operations in almost every mountain as it was believed that there was greater power in these rocks.\nThe second part of the Age of Discovery was the discovery of spelljammers. The arcanists of Netheril created only one outpost, Yeomans Loft and conducted many \"experiments\" on anything they encountered. This behavior gave them a very bad reputation, resulting in their separation from the spelljamming community. A lone arcanist, Oberon, tried his best to repair their reputation but to no effect. As a result, the Netherese could not trade and so most spelljamming explorations were abandoned, because they were too expensive.\nThe end of the Age of Discovery is marked by the birth of Karsus."
