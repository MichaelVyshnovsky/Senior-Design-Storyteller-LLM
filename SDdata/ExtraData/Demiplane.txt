{{Otheruses4|the [[plane]]|other uses|Demiplane (disambiguation)}}
'''Demiplanes''' were ill-defined [[plane]]s of unusually small size that lay either within other planes or outside the known planes depending on which [[cosmology|cosmological]] model one used. Demiplanes were typically, if not always, of finite size.{{cite book/Dungeon Master's Guide 5th edition|68}}{{Cite polyhedron/124/Islands Campaigns Part 3: Speaking (demi-)planely|24}}

==Characteristics==
According to earlier sources, demiplanes were planes still in the formation process, unfinished somehow{{cite book/Manual of the Planes 3rd edition|7}} for planes of generally measurable size and limited access,{{cite book/Dungeon Master's Guide v.3.5|147}} sometimes limited sufficiently that not even the [[ethereal plane]] or the [[astral plane]] were accessible, save from specific spots in other planes. They had great variety of possible conditions within.{{cite book/Manual of the Planes 3rd edition|153-155}} They were always extradimensional spaces.

Demiplanes could be naturally occurring, but most were created by deities or by wielders of magic,{{cite book/A Guide to the Ethereal Plane|42-43}}{{cite book/Epic Level Handbook|117}} [[Zagyg]] of [[Oerth]] was notorious for creating demiplanes.{{cite book/A Guide to the Ethereal Plane|20}}

==Position in Cosmic Models==
* In the [[Great Wheel cosmology]], demiplanes were found in the [[Ethereal plane]] because they were formed from the swirling proto-matter that made up the Ethereal, though they lacked a set place in the Planes. The [[Demiplane of Shadow]] was the best known example.
* In the [[World Tree cosmology]], there were a few demiplanes that were part of astral dominions such as the demiplane of [[Sildëyuir]].
* In the [[World Axis cosmology]], demiplanes could exist within other planes or outside of either the parallel planes or the fundamental planes. There were undoubtedly several of them, but most were unknown. Aside from those that lay within the dominions of the gods, the best known was [[Sigil]], also called the City of Doors, which acted as a strange interplanar nexus with hidden doors to every known plane—and many that remained largely unknown.
