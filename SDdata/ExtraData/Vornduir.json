When inhaled it provided a variety of effects to the user, ranging from very mild to severe, annoying or even pleasureful.\nThe drug vornduir was made from a mixture of essences of certain animals and select herbs.\nThe primary effect of vornduir was a lack of physiological response to the effects of cold, even in extreme cases. Many users felt warm, content, and alert, even in near-freezing rain or snow. While they wouldnt go into shock or suffer lower internal body temperature, it was still possible for them to outright freeze solid in extreme cold.\nSome of the side-effects caused were\n* No effect whatsoever,\n* Mild itching and rashes, and\n* Pain and pleasure stimuli being reversed for an hour (a cut gave pleasure where a tender caress brought agony).\nCategoryDrugs\nk59gxsljolsm3q1yeob90br68lhadm1"
