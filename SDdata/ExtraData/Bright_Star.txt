The '''Bright Star''' was a lovelorn character from a myth in [[Sildëyuir]], an elder elf whose love for the [[Far Traveler]] was parted by events for centuries, but in the end they found the way back to each other. A constellation in Sildëyuir's sky was named after her. [[Nangulis]] called [[Kiril Duskmourn]], his love, by the pet name of Bright Star.{{cite book/Stardeep|290|28}}{{cite book/Stardeep|70|6}}
