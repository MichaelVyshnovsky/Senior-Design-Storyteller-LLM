        "mainbody": "'''''Banishment''''' was a [[psionic]] science of the [[psychoportation]] [[discipline]] that allowed the [[psionicist]] to ''[[teleport (psionics)|teleport]]'' a creature against their will.",
        "Effects": "The psionicist ''teleported'' the target creature into a pocket dimension and held it there for as long as they continued to expend psychic energy. For this power to work the creature needed to be within {{SI|30|feet|long=yes}} of the psionicist when ''banished''. The creature would return to the same spot where it was standing when the ''banishment'' ended. Creatures capable of traveling to the [[astral plane|astral]] or [[ethereal plane]] had a chance to escape the pocket dimension on their own.",
