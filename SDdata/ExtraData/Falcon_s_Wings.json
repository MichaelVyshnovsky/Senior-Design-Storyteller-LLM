        "mainbody": "The Falcon's Wings''' was a ritual used by [[sha'ir]]s to grant the permanent ability of flight to their [[gen]]s.",
        "Preparation": "The sha'ir needed to collect the feathers of a [[falcon]] taken directly from the falcon's aerie. It was vital to the success of the ritual that the sha'ir collect the feathers themselves. Once collected, the feathers were glued to the gen using a special unguent. The associated materials needed to create the unguent cost 1,000 [[dinar]]s.\n\nThe actual ritual lasted for 36 hours. If the ritual succeeded, the gen would be granted the permanent ability of flight with exceptional control and maneuverability. A gen could fly for up to one hour before exhaustion set in."
