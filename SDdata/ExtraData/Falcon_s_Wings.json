        "mainbody": "The Falcons Wings was a ritual used by shairs to grant the permanent ability of flight to their gens.\nThe shair needed to collect the feathers of a falcon taken directly from the falcons aerie. It was vital to the success of the ritual that the shair collect the feathers themselves. Once collected, the feathers were glued to the gen using a special unguent. The associated materials needed to create the unguent cost 1,000 dinars.\nThe actual ritual lasted for 36 hours. If the ritual succeeded, the gen would be granted the permanent ability of flight with exceptional control and maneuverability. A gen could fly for up to one hour before exhaustion set in."
