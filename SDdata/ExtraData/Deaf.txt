'''Deafness''' was a condition characterized by partial or complete inability to hear.

==Causes==
An injury to one's ear could cause partial deafness, while a serious injury to both could cause total deafness,<ref> Injuries included a broken ear drum and a burn, electric shock, or vibration to the head.<ref> Some forms of magically induced madness could also make a creature deaf.<ref> Commonly, deafness was also associated with old age.<ref>

Loud noises could cause temporary or permanent deafness, such as those emitted by [[Thunderstone (item)|thunderstones]],<ref> various loud spells like ''shout'',<ref><ref> and a ''[[staff of thunder and lightning]]''.<ref><ref><ref> The incessant screaming winds of [[Pandemonium]] deafened all creatures there; less than a minute of exposure was enough to cause temporary deafness for up to an hour after escaping, but a full day caused permanent deafness. Naturally, a high percentage of the residents of the Madhouse in [[Pandesmos]] were deaf.

Some [[spell]]s might also make a creature deaf, with the spell ''[[deafness]]'' an obvious example that directly caused complete and permanent hearing loss.<ref> Similar spells were ''[[dictum]]'' (only non-[[lawful]] beings),<ref> ''[[word of chaos]]'' (only non-[[chaotic]] beings),<ref> ''[[holy word]]'' (only non-[[good]] beings),<ref> and ''[[unholy word]]'', as well as ''[[storm of vengeance]]''.<ref><ref> Finally, by nullifying all sound, a ''[[silence]]'' spell made beings effectively deaf while within its effect.<ref><ref>

Finally, spells and magical effects that let one [[scry]] on another location or borrow another creature's senses could leave the caster oblivious to their own surroundings, including rendering them effectively deaf, for the duration.<ref><ref> Conversely, a [[scrying]] sensor could still function even for a deafened caster.<ref>

==Effects==
Being deaf limited one's awareness, so a deaf creature could be slower to react to surprises and the start of battle and was vulnerable to ambush. Moreover, a deaf spellcaster might mispronounce their [[verbal component]]s, causing their spells to miscast and fail. Similarly, a deaf bard might be unable to play their magical music.<ref> 

On the other hand, a deaf creature could be resistant or immune to spells that must be heard to take effect, such as ''[[dissonant whispers]]'' and the ''power word'' line of spells, as well as the entrancing songs of [[harpies]] and the deafening roars of monsters like the [[androsphinx]]. In fact, the ''[[staff of silence]]'' could invoke magical ''deafness'' on its bearer specifically for this purpose, protecting them against permanent physical deafness.<ref>

==Treatment==
Some forms of deafness could be cured with spells like ''cure deafness'' or ''[[remove deafness]]'', which restored the ability but did not heal or regrow diseased or lost ears and other auditory organs.<ref><ref> Healing spells like ''[[lesser restoration]]'' and ''[[heal]]'' could also have this effect.<ref><ref>

A [[potion]] that cured deafness required powdered [[brandeen]] (a [[gem]]) mixed with fresh hardwood sap and a ''[[message]]'' spell cast upon it, the message being made up of only vowel sounds. The potion could not be exposed to sunlight and had to be consumed within twenty-four hours or it spoiled.<ref>

An [[ear horn]] could aid in hearing when put to one's ear.<ref> The magical ''[[ear horn of hearing]]'' eliminated deafness while used.

It was also possible to have a hearing-ear animal, which would warn its deaf owner of dangers and alert them to audible signals and other events around them. [[Marigold's Menagerie]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] trained service animals for this and similar purposes.

People with long-term hearing loss could learn to adapt, and might get used to or even overcome some of the disadvantages. After becoming comfortable with the condition, a deaf person might object to being unwillingly cured of their deafness. For example, they might not like the noise they'd then have to endure. However, long-term and life-long deafness could also lead to difficulties in speaking and even muteness.

To prevent damage to hearing caused by loud noises, ear plugs and the like could be used, but did themselves hinder hearing.

==Society==
Especially when alongside muteness, deaf people could struggle to communicate and express their needs. while the deaf Waterdhavian street urchin [[Nat]] devised her own sign language to communicate with her friends. Non-deaf people speaking to them might raise their voice or even shout to be heard.

People born with disabilities such as deafness, muteness, and others were viewed by a number of faiths in Faer√ªn as "godstruck", that is, as holy people sent by the gods to test others by how they treated them. If true, this was a test that many failed. Those parents who were unwilling to raise a godstruck child would leave them at a monastery, where the priests were rarely likely to be cruel. They raised the child, taught them the faith, and had them do chores. Beyond these areas, many unfortunate disabled folk did fall into begging, drudgery, freak shows, and [[prostitution]].<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/Stone Bridge and Disabilities}}

In the [[Elfsong Tavern]] in [[Baldur's Gate]], deaf people were advised not to make noises when the haunting elven song was heard, a time when other patrons fell silent to listen to it.<ref>

A [[drow]]-run bathhouse and massage parlor called the [[Silken Rack]] in [[Menzoberranzan]] kept deaf-mute human [[slave]]s.<ref>

==History==
The [[Netherese]] [[arcanist]] [[Cragh]] was born deaf in {{YearlinkConvert|1759|NY}} and was unable to speak as a result, communicating instead via a sign language. Nevertheless, he studied to become a gifted [[mentalist]] and the greatest [[archwizard]] of [[Northreach]], well respected by his peers and named "dwarf-friend" by the [[dwarves]] of [[Ascore]]. He learned to cast most spells without [[verbal component]]s, and spoke only rarely for those that he could not. He developed the ''deafness'' spell in {{YearlinkConvert|1860|NY}}, then known as  ''Cragh's deafness''.<ref>

The infant [[Tira]] was abandoned at the [[Hand of Mercy Children's Hospital and Orphanage]] in [[Ravens Bluff]] around [[1362 DR]], after being found to have born deaf. Because of her special needs, people looking to adopt always passed over her in favor of other, easier children. She learned simple signs to express basic needs, but had no way to communicate more complex information. Fortunately, by age 8, the renegade [[drow]] [[Valandrin Telenna]], nicknamed "Dusk", had begun tutoring her in Drow Sign Language. She also received a hearing-ear dog, named [[Bounder]], from Marigold's Menagerie.

A [[medusa]] without ears, and therefore potentially deaf, dwelling in a cave in the [[Storm Horns]] foothills was reported to have been sighted by a [[mushroom]] hunter of [[Minroe]], [[Cormyr]], in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. As the people of Minroe had [[shrieker]]s guarding their village, they feared the medusa would slip past their defenses, and so sought someone to slay the deaf medusa.<ref>

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, [[Elminster]] appeared unannounced at the [[Midwinter]] meeting of the [[Dales Council]] and complained that if the people of [[Archendale]] were not even going to hear envoys bringing criticisms of their mass logging activities, then he should turn all Arkhenfolk wholly deaf. When a minor Arkhen mage disputed the possibility, Elminster used his Art to deafen the man, only restoring his hearing after protests from the representative [[Swords of Archendale|Sword of Archendale]].<ref>
