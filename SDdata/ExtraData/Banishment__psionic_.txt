Banishment was a psionic science of the psychoportation discipline that allowed the psionicist to teleport a creature against their will.
The psionicist teleported the target creature into a pocket dimension and held it there for as long as they continued to expend psychic energy. For this power to work the creature needed to be within  of the psionicist when banished. The creature would return to the same spot where it was standing when the banishment ended. Creatures capable of traveling to the astral or ethereal plane had a chance to escape the pocket dimension on their own.
