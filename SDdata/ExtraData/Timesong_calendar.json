That year it would be first used among some merfolk groups and by the shalarin, becoming tied to the Third Passing of the shalarin.\nThe Timesong calendar was split into ten months, referred to as \"songs\", with each lasting three \"currents\". Each current was twelve days in length, making for a total of thirty-six days per song. There was also an additional five days in the midyear that fell between two months, bringing the total number of days in most \"cycles\" (years) to 365. Much like the Calendar of Harptos, days were simply referred to by their number within a song or current, rather than having a distinct name.\nYears were referred to in the Timesong system as \"cycles\". Some cycles were given names based on historical events, myths, or stories so as to better remember them. which became widely known as the \"Timesong of Iakhovas the Ravager\", marking it as the time of the Twelfth Serôs War. Though for most years it was more common to simply refer to them by a number, followed by the word \"Timesong\" or its acronym \"TS\", such as \"652 Timesong\" or .\nFive of the songs within the Timesong calendar were named for an activity in Serôs that the song was primarily associated with, while five of the others were named in reverence to major deities of the ocean. The names and aliases of these songs, the activity associated with them, and their relationship to the months of the Calendar of Harptos were as followed\n* Icesong (\"The Seas Cloak\") This song was named for the winter season.

This song was also marked by minor kelp harvests.\n** From Eleint 15 to Marpenoth 19\n* Roamsong (\"The Journey\") This songs name, as well the nickname it shared with Homesong, was derived from it being the time during each cycle when the migratory races of Serôs began making their annual journey to the southern waters of the Inner Sea in light of the coming winter. These migratory journeys were often harassed along the way by sahuagin.\n** Marpenoth 20 to Uktar 25\n* Umbersong (\"Umberlees Threat\") This song was named for the deity Umberlee.
