 Metapsionics
Receptacle was a psionic devotion used by psionicists to store power in objects.
The power could be used on gemstones, with an ability to store energy that was directly proportional to their value, or on vessels that had been prepared through the empower psionic science.
Through the use of this devotion, these could be gradually filled with power over time. Though there was no limit to the receptacles a given psionicist could create, they couldnt more than double their available potential energy by means of that psionic devotion the total power stored in all of their receptacles could not exceed their personal full power. Investing that amount of power took roughly a couple hours for many psionicists, while particularly powerful ones required twice or more that time.
A psionicist who held a receptacle could call on its stored power for as long as the vessel held potential and was in contact with their skin, allowing them to manifest powers for longer, or more often than they would on their own potential alone. However, damage to the vessel would drain an amount of the psionicists potential equivalent to the vessels power currently available for manifesting. It also halved the recovery of their energies until they recovered completely.
