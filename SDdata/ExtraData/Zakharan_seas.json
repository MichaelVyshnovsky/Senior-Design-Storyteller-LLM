Zakharas central Cities of the Heart stretched along its shores, from Golden Huzuz, \"the heart of the heart\", in the south, to industrious Hiyal in the north. Its narrowest part, located at the height of Wasat in the middle, separated Suq Bay into a Southern and a Northern Quarter.\n*From Hiyal to the west, the Al-Tariq Channel (\"The Passage\") connected Suq Bay to the inland Sea of Caravans. \nTogether, these interior bodies of water separated the west of Zakhara almost completely from its central and eastern portion, with only a relatively narrow strip of land between Qudra and Liham connecting the regions of the High Desert and the Haunted Lands.\nZakharan seas\nZakharan seas\nZakharan seas\nZakharan seas\nCategoryBodies of water\nh2hshij54hgdfkspqt99da2mjm6q5cy"
