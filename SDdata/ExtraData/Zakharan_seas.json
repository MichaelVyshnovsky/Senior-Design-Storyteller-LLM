        "Surrounding seas": "The Land of Fate was surrounded by three major seas:<br />\n*The [[Great Sea]], or \"Bahr al-Kibar\", stretched to the north and west, separating Zakhara and [[Faerûn]].\n*To the east daring sailors crossed the [[Foreigners' Sea]], or \"Bahr al-Ajami\", to the distant lands of [[Kara-Tur]].\n*To the south Zakhara was bounded by the so-called [[Crowded Sea]], or \"Bahr al-Izdiham\", characterized by a large number of inhabited as well as unknown islands and crossed by many trading ships.<ref><ref>",
        "Interior seas": "*Between the cities of [[Jumlat]] and [[I'tiraf]], the Crowded Sea narrowed to form the [[Golden Gulf]] that separated the [[League of the Pantheon]] to the east from its ideological counterpart, the [[Pearl Cities]], to the west.<ref>\n*To the north, the gulf narrowed again into long and narrow [[Suq Bay]]. Zakhara's central [[Cities of the Heart]] stretched along its shores, from [[Huzuz|Golden Huzuz]], \"the heart of the heart\", in the south,<ref> to industrious [[Hiyal]] in the north<ref>.<ref> Its narrowest part, located at the height of [[Wasat]] in the middle, separated Suq Bay into a Southern and a Northern Quarter.\n*From Hiyal to the west, the [[Al-Tariq Channel]] (\"The Passage\") connected Suq Bay to the inland [[Sea of Caravans]].<ref><br /> \nTogether, these interior bodies of water separated the west of Zakhara almost completely from its central and eastern portion, with only a relatively narrow strip of land between [[Qudra]] and [[Liham]] connecting the regions of the [[High Desert]] and the [[Haunted Lands]].",
