'''''Repugnance''''' was a [[psionic]] power of the [[telepathy]] [[discipline]] that made a target utterly loathe something or someone and seek to destroy it.

==Effects==
After making [[contact]], the manifester caused the target to find something to be absolutely repugnant to them. This could be an item, a place, or specific person, as the manifester chose. Consumed with hatred or disgust, the target was driven to completely destroy it as soon as they could. However, if this was entirely against their basic nature (for example, a [[cleric]] made to find a shrine to their god repugnant), they might shake it off.

==Prerequisite Powers==
It could require ''[[contact]]'' and ''[[mindlink]]'' to learn.

==Users==
''Repugnance'' was known by [[haun]]s, who'd use it to disrupt foes as they escaped.

In psionics terms, ''repugnance'' could be known by [[yuan-ti]], who'd use it to make targets find [[snake]]s repugnant.<ref>
