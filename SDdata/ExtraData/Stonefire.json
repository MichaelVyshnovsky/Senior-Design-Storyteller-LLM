Stonefire bombs, called '''firepots''', could be lobbed at structures and enemies to cause great damage.",
        "History": "Stonefire was used extensively in the [[drow]] cities of [[Menzoberranzan]] and [[Ched Nasad]] during the [[Silence of Lolth]] ([[1372]]–[[1373 DR]]). Drow rebels and slaves led by [[Syrzan]] used it during the uprising in Menzoberranzan. [[Clan Xornbane]] used them on the attack on [[House Melarn (Ched Nasad)|House Melarn]] and later upon Ched Nasad itself, causing the complete destruction of the city when the stonefire brought down the cities calcified web layers, creating a cascading effect as the city's structures plummeted to the bottom of the chasm. The [[duergar]] army of [[Gracklstugh]] also used firepots during the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]], damaging parts of [[Tier Breche]]. It was revealed that the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] had secretly been providing the firepots in order to weaken drow society.",
