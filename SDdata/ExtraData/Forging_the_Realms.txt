Forging the Realms, or Forging the Forgotten Realms, was a weekly series of web articles written by Ed Greenwood on the [https//dnd.wizards.com/ Dungeons & Dragons] website from September 2012 to October 2014, with 102 articles in total. In them, Greenwood discussed aspects of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, in and out of universe, with no particular theme. Due to redevelopments of the D&D website, approximately half are no longer available there, and while most were recorded on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, the remaining three were luckily archived at the Candlekeep website.
