        "mainbody": "The Fives Shires were a lush and tranquil halfling nation on the world of Mystara, that ran northeast along the base of a mountain range called the Black Spires. It was also known as Hinhome, for the halflings of Mystara referred to themselves as hin, Beyond the name similarity, the hin of these two worlds were said to have much in common.\nHidden deep beneath the Black Spires was a circle of Blackflame, a magical fire-like substance, and it acted as a portal to the halfling nations of Luiren on Toril and Green Fields on Oerth. More specifically, this portal would dump one out somewhere in the northeastern reaches of Luiren. In the Present Age, it was unknown if the portal still existed as of the late 1400s DR.\nDuring a time of pestilence and savage warfare against orcs, the hin were forced to go into hiding underground for protection and in the process broke into tunnels that predated their own, wherein they discovered the Blackflame. The Blackflame served as a rallying point for the hin, igniting newfound hope for the future.\nIn later centuries, the Blackflame would become a cornerstone of the Shires clans and their sacred mysteries faith, with each clan stronghold keeping a crucible of Blackflame within a sacred place and two to three \"back-ups\" hidden underground. The hin were very secretive regarding the substance and its many powers,\nThus, most of what travel there was between Toril and Mystara was by halfling merchants traversing between Luiren and the Five Shires. The Minstrelwishes, a mercantile family of Torilian halflings that collected lore on portals and were interested in planewalking, were also found in Mystara and the Five Shires."
