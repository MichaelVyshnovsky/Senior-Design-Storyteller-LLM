Menhirs were a type of stone formation typically used for portals or outdoor religious shrines.
In ancient times, the Yuir folk of Aglarond used menhir stones that were infused with crystals to create monumental circles that they performed mystical ceremonies in and used as portals. These menhirs all bore inscriptions that were carved in their ancient Elven dialect. Over time the power of these menhirs faded and they became buried within the undergrowth of Yuirwood, overgrown with grass or moss. Those that retained their old magic glowed unearthly colors under the light of the full moon. Some became used as meeting places by fey creatures, such as pixies and sprites.
The menhir circles that remained known of within the Yuirwood formed a portal network that the Masters of the Yuirwood, an elite group of half-elven druids and rangers, used to rapidly move across the woods to respond to any growing threats. Beyond the forest, they could even travel to the realm of Sildëyuir.
In 1359 DR, Zembrath Klun discovered a menhir on Mezeketh Isle that was inscribed in an ancient Jhaamdathan script.
During the Spellplague, many of the menhir circles of Yuirwood seemed to attract active pockets of the eponymous plague.
In 1479 DR,The date for all Year 1 RPGA sanctioned adventures is considered to be 1479 DR for the purposes of this wiki. the Festering Wound tribe conducted a mining operation within the Tannath Mountains on behalf of a mage known as the Saffron Devil, harvesting within its depths the same menhir stones that were once used by the Yuir folk. They attached the mined stones to sledges, which they then had pulled by giant ants.
