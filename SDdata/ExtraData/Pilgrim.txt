'''Pilgrims''' were pious individuals who traveled to destinations that were considered holy to their faith, often in groups, in order to receive inspiration or some form of blessing. Such ventures were referred to as '''pilgrimages'''.

==Culture==
The types of pious people that conducted pilgrimages spanned all [[alignment]]s. Though [[human]]s were the race most known to make pilgrimages, In the [[Shining South]] and [[Unapproachable East]], pilgrims were typically humans, [[half-elves]], or [[half-orc]]s.

For many cities, pilgrims tended to come from the lower or middle class. Depending upon how pious a pilgrim was, they were willing to travel great distances and even risk their life in order to reach a pilgrimage site.

Usually a pilgrimage was done by foot, though some traveled upon a [[mount]]. These groups almost always had [[cleric]]s, [[druid]]s, or [[monk]]s traveling with them. Such individuals were either pilgrims themselves or acting as a pilgrimage band's leader or guards. This duty of protection was also performed by [[divine champion]]s.

Some religions had deities that were patrons specifically of pilgrims. One such example was the [[Padhran religion]] of the [[Hordelands]], which had the [[Padhrasattva of Pilgrims]].<ref group="note">The name of the Padhrasattva of Pilgrims is unknown.

==Possessions==
On occasion, pilgrim groups carried a religious relic. These were carefully hidden and heavily guarded by a variety of traps and/or magical devices,

==History==
In [[1209 DR]], a large train of pilgrims traveling to the [[Wa]] town of [[Aru]]'s [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]] were slaughtered in a mountain pass by a gang of bandits aided by supernatural monsters. The land's [[daimyo]], [[Arata Matsumoto]], was reprimanded by Wa's shogun over this event and thus the following year Arata sent a group of [[samurai]] to guard the annual train of pilgrims. However, just like last time, everyone was slaughtered by the bandits in [[1210 DR]]. The bandit attacks on pilgrim trains in Wa would continue for many years.

In [[1361 DR]], a group of pilgrims and soldiers of the [[Church of Helm]] announced having discovered a rich land far to the west of the [[Moonshae Isles]] and [[Evermeet]].

In the 1360s, many [[Mielikki]]an pilgrimages were made to the [[Green Door]] inn. Around that same time, [[The Belt]] often received pilgrims, likely there to see the shrines dedicated to [[Chauntea]] or [[Silvanus]], who behaved in a similar manner to the lawless brigands that could be occasionally encountered in the area.

Some time prior to [[1367 DR]], on the [[Pilgrims' Route]] of [[Zakhara]] a man named [[Komar al-Anni]] sacrificed his life to save a band of pilgrims from some [[jann]].

In [[1368 DR]], during [[Highharvestide]], a wave of [[Church of Tyr|Tyrran]] pilgrims and [[warrior]]s descended upon the [[Fortress Faithful]] in [[Tethyr]] to aid the cause of [[Zaranda Star]] in what came to be known as the First Siege of [[Myratma]].

While touring the [[Dalelands]] in [[1370 DR]], the famous travel writer [[Volothamp Geddarm]] managed to obtain approval for entering the [[Shrine of Swords]]. However, he was ushered out by his escorts after asking about the [[iron golem]] that stood behind the shrine. He then later paid a pilgrim to query the [[Swordmaster]] [[Sakaria]] about it.

==Trade==
Businesses in areas that experienced high pilgrimage traffic would often try to capitalize on it. Such an area was the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] in [[Waterdeep]]&mdash;in particular, its inn called the [[Pilgrim’s Rest]]. In [[Ravens Bluff]], [[Burnhardt's Outfitting]] carried religious goods for passing pilgrims to purchase.{{Cite polyhedron/47/The Living City: Burnhart's Outfitting|28}}

In the [[Huzuz/People's Quarter|People's Quarter]] of the Zakharan city of [[Huzuz]], pilgrimages were so annually frequent that its temple district was called the [[Pilgrims' District]] and almost every business therein tried to cater to them.

==Pilgrimage Sites==
Throughout the Realms, there were a variety of landmarks, some even being churches, deemed religiously significant because of something that had occurred at the spot.

For those traveling to such sites, there were often sleeping quarters and aid provided by temples either nearby or along the route to it. These included the [[Temple of the Harvest Moon]], the [[Mosque of the Thirsty Jann]], and the cloisters that were scattered throughout Tethyr to ease the burden of [[Ilmater|Ilmatari]] pilgrims. Kuo-toan cities had apartment buildings reserved for pilgrims to stay in.

What inciting incident for a locale becoming a pilgrimage site was widely varied. It could be because of a famous battle, a miracle, being a hero's birthplace or the site of their death, the site of a great evil's defeat, or other fantastical events. Sometimes there were even holidays related to the event that made the location into a landmark.
