        "mainbody": "Arambar was a kind of ambient energy that enveloped the atmosphere of the world of Abeir, changing the color of the sky from blue to steel-colored. Abeirans called this phenomenon the Steelsky.\nSince ancient times, the arambar was used by the Steelsky Liberators, a group of rebels dedicated to free Abeir of draconic oppression, as a source to power certain spells and abilities of divine nature to combat dragons and other monsters that oppressed the people of Abeir.\nLikewise, a few Abeiran dragons inhaled arambar in a complicated ritual before their sleep in hopes of gaining insights into current or past events in a specific area of knowledge. This process was not reliable, however, and most of the time the dragons who performed the ritual learned nothing. In a few and rare instances, dragons failed to wake up again, and in time faded to a wraith-like form called rathrea, gaining the ability to predict the future.\nAs of 1479 DR, the Empress Dragon Gauwervyndhal was known for forcing her suzerains to perform the ritual on her behalf.\nArambar had other uses as well, such as its ability to grant temporary precognitive powers.\nThe arambar began to exist on Abeir not long after the death of the primordial Arambar, and many believed this energy came from its corpse, hence the name. The arambar was blessed by an unknown entity or god who opposed the rule of dragons, and this blessing was strengthened by the souls of those who died under draconic oppression ever since.\nIn 1385 DR, when the Spellplague sent the continent of Laerakond to the world of Toril, the arambar suffusing the land was so strong that it changed the portion of the Torilian sky over Laerakond from blue to steel-colored. The Steelsky persisted even a century after, as in 1479 DR the sky above Laerakond was still the color of steel.\nfrArambar\nCategoryEnergies\nCategoryItems from Laerakond\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems from Abeir\nrr2hrik4nl7ctwp22dd8ivkjly1p6n0"
