'''''Molecular agitation''''' was a minor [[psionic]] devotion of the [[psychokinesis]] [[discipline]] that allowed a [[psion]] to rapidly excite the molecules within an object so as to generate heat within the target.<ref group="note" name="power">In 1{{st}} edition, it was stated within the "Area of Effect" for ''molecular agitation'' that the target could be either an item or a '''creature''', though its description made mention of only items. When the power was updated for 2{{nd}} edition [[AD&D]], its "Area of Effect" was updated to mention only items, even specifying a target weight of {{SI|1|lb}}, though the mentions of skin and hair in the effects section implies that it might be possible to target creatures.

==Effects==
This power could be used to target one item, weighing no more than {{SI|1|lb|long=yes}}, within {{SI|40|yard|long=yes}} of the psion. Early instances of this power found that all effects occurred after a period of ten minutes. Later documentation found that ''molecular agitation's'' were actually evident as early as one minute, but that their severity increased the longer the power was active for.

For the first minute of active use: readily flammable material would ignite and burn brightly, such as [[paper]], [[parchment]], straw, dry [[grass]], etc. Skin would become red and tender. And wood would darken.

After two minutes of active use: wood would begin to smoke and smolder, metal would become hot to the touch (an effect some described as being similar to the spell ''[[heat metal]]''), skin would begin to blister, hair would begin to smolder, and [[paint]] would shrivel.

After three minutes of active use: wood would properly become aflame, metal would be scorching, skin would be burning away, water would be boiling, and [[lead]] would melt.

After four minutes, ''molecular agitation'' would cause even [[steel]] to grow soft, and after five minutes of active use steel would melt.

==Significance==
This power was one of the prerequisites for learning the psychokinesis discipline ''[[detonate]]''.
