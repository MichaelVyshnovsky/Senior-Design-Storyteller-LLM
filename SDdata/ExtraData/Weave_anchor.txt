A '''weave anchor''' was a mortal being, object, or a place{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-02-24 - Weave Anchors}} that was invested with part of the divine essence of [[Mystra]]. Such entities served to stabilize the [[Weave]] should anything happen to the goddess.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-08-15 - Creation of the Weave anchors}}

==History==
Creation of the anchors was imposed upon Mystra by [[Ao]] the overgod, in order to keep the goddess's power in check and to increase the stability of the world.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-06-19 - Origin of the Weave anchors}}

In the {{yearlinkName|1487}}, High Prince [[Telamont Tanthul]] began a campaign to seek out the weave anchors of [[Faer√ªn]], in order to drain their energy and aid [[Shar]] with her efforts to destroy the Weave.

That same year, [[Storm Silverhand]], [[Elminster Aumar]], and his granddaughter [[Amarune Whitewave]] traveled across the [[Western Heartlands]] seeking out lingering magical [[ward]]s, so that they could help create new ones and strengthen the Weave. Ultimately, Elminster joined [[Laeral Silverhand|Laeral]] and [[Alustriel Silverhand]], along with the [[Srinshee]] to destroy the anchor at [[Myth Drannor]] to prevent it from being corrupted and keep safe the city's people.

==Abilities==
Weave anchors stabilized the Weave around them, causing [[antimagic field]]s, [[dead-magic zone]]s, and disjunction effects (like ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction]]'') to fail around them.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-05-29 - Effects of the Spellplague}}{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-08-30 - Accessing magic without the Weave}}

Weave anchors kept a connection to the Weave even when they left [[Realmspace]],{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-04 - Elminster accessing magic on Earth}} allowing Mystra to communicate with them and to see through them. They also had a tendency to live longer than the usual lifespan of their kin, and to escape death against the odds.

It was possible to create new weave anchors at locations that had been magically [[ward]]ed.
