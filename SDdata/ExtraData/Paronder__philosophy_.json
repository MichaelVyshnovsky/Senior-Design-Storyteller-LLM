For instance, if someone did something good, the cosmos would do something good for them, but if they did something evil, they would be repaid with evil, and so on.\nAccording to Elminster Aumar, the term was named for a human sage named Paronder, who first promoted the belief that the practice of magic had its own tenets and principles, and that studying magical theory would be something useful to those who sought to wield and understand magic.\nOne of the main practitioners of this philosophy was the archdevil Klaskornus, although Elminster believed that his motives were far from selfless.\nCategoryMagic\nl215dqdiehy3l3hmksco5mc28o50vun"
