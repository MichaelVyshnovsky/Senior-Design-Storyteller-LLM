In truth, once a Grandfather got old and died, a new one was chosen to take his place. This superstition that the Grandfather could not die was one of the guilds many terror weapons. Parents in Vaasa and Damara often threatened naughty children by telling them that the Grandfather would come take them away if they didnt behave.\nIn the , an unnamed Grandfather of Assassins, in league with the Witch-King Zhengyi, and priests of Orcus, attacked Bloodstone Village with an army of mainly human brigands and orcs, but also with wyverns, giants, and other monsters. This attack was thwarted by the paladin Gareth Dragonsbane and his party of adventurers and the Grandfather was killed by the monk Kane.\nThe next Grandfather of Assassins was Timoshenko, who played the political face of the organization. His chief lieutenant, the wizard Knellict, carried out the dirty work."
