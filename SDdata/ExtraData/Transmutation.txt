The transmutation school of magic consisted of spells that changed the physical properties of some creature, thing, or condition. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the casters command, or enhance a creatures innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injuries. The school was previously known as alteration. The transmutation school had no subschools. A wizard who specialized in transmutation was known as a transmuter.
Transmutation spells included bulls strength, cats grace, bears endurance, foxs cunning, owls wisdom, eagles splendor, and the various polymorph spells.
