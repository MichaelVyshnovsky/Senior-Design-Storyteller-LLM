The '''transmutation''' school of magic consisted of [[spell]]s that changed the physical properties of some creature, thing, or condition. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injuries. The school was previously known as '''alteration'''. The transmutation school had no subschools. A [[wizard]] who specialized in transmutation was known as a ''[[transmuter]]''.

Transmutation spells included ''[[bull's strength]]'', [[Cat's grace|''cat's grace'']], [[Bear's endurance|''bear's endurance'']], ''[[fox's cunning]]'', [[Owl's wisdom|''owl's wisdom'']], ''[[eagle's splendor]]'', and the various polymorph spells.
