A '''Scornubrian sandglass''' was a miniature [[hourglass]] made in [[Scornubel]] that took two minutes and two seconds to empty its contents. It was often used to time moves in games or it could be used to limit the time taken to make a decision or to choose a partner during certain festivals.{{Cite dragon/421/Abyssal Trade Goods: Not a Bad Thing}}
