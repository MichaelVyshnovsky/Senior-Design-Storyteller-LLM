The '''Twin Visages''' were located on the north coast of [[Payit]]. The 'visages' were a pair of faces (one of a man, the other a woman) carved into the cliffside on either side of the ocean harbor where the god [[Qotal]] set sail from. Both faced east, supposedly watching for Qotal's return. On top of the cliff stood a crumbling pyramid.<ref>
