==Description==
[[File:LostOne.png|thumb|273px|''A lost one looks forward with a catatonic stare.'']]
A lost one was typically denoted by the terrified, tortured expressions bared by their faces, their catatonic movements, and the lifeless, blankness of their eyes. They rarely spoke with others, save to utter warnings or periodically fly into fits of hysteria. They often confined themselves to a place they felt safe within, losing interest in the outside world at large.

A lost one was normally averse to fighting and wouldn't make any effort to defend themselves, but when confronted with the type of evil that had shattered their mind a lost one would fly into a berserk rage and attack it with whatever was nearby.

==Notable Lost Ones==
* [[Tatyana|Anna]], a fragment of the soul of [[Tatyana]] of [[Barovia]] that had escaped the Domains of Dread and found its way to the [[Prime Material]] world of [[Toril]], reborn as a woman with madness that was eventually committed to an insane asylum in [[Waterdeep]]. [[Jander Sunstar]] later learned that she was considered a lost one.<ref>

==History==
Sometime in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], on a day when [[The Veil]] rolled into [[Ravens Bluff]] a bloodthirsty [[inquisitor (disambiguation)|inquisitor]] arrived to the city on a pirate ship. Over the next several days he committed a series of bizarre murders in the city's seediest sections, often upon the homeless, mutilating their bodies. The city's chief constable, [[Rolf Sunriver]], hired a group of [[adventurer]]s to investigate these serial killings.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/To Live and Die in Ravens Bluff|1-3}} While waiting for him in the [[Bloating Mermaid Inn]] the adventurers fell asleep and woke up to find themselves in a strange abandoned version of the inn, having been dragged by the mists of Ravenloft into the city of [[Touraine]] in the domain of [[Nidala]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/To Live and Die in Ravens Bluff|5}}

While walking around the city adventurers met a group of five female lost ones. [[Gwendolyn (Nidala)|Gwendolyn]], who had been traumatized by [[ghoul]]s; [[Linda (Nidala)|Linda]], who had been traumatized by a [[lich]]; [[Monica (Nidala)|Monica]], who had been traumatized by a [[mummy]]; [[Veronica (Nidala)|Veronica]], who had been traumatized by a [[vampire]]; and [[Wanda (Nidala)|Wanda]], who had been traumatized by a [[werewolf]]. The five frantically pulled them to their nearby compatriot [[Ilsa]], lying in a pool of her own blood, who had been assaulted by the inquisitor just moments before. The adventurers possibly healed Ilsa and spent time with each of the woman until their escort [[Agnetha Corbett]] arrived, who explained that the women were all Asylum patients she was taking on a walk. Before the two groups departed, Gwendolyn gifted the adventurers a rare antique [[coin]] as thanks for saving Ilsa's life.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/To Live and Die in Ravens Bluff|6-7}}
