The Cracked Jewel Saga (or Procampur series) is a series of tournament adventures in the Living City campaign of organized play for 2-edition Dungeons & Dragons. Unlike most Living City adventures, these are all set in or around the city of Procampur, Jewel of the Vast.
The Procampur expansion project for Living City was announced in 1997. The project was overseen by the Universe Construction Company (a group of Living City designers), led by Jay Fisher and Daniel Cooper. They were split into a City Development Team (responsible for the design of the city and its lore) and a Tournament Development Team (responsible for creating the tournament adventures). The initial plan was for a 10-part (later 11-part
In A Vial Secret, the players attempt to intercept a philter of love. Unbeknownst to everyone, the philter is then used on Rendeth, Thultyrl of Procampur, causing him to fall in love with Constantine Grimm. The couple immediately announce their engagement. The noble Lady Alissa Wyndsong, who also had her eyes on marrying the thultyrl, secretly dispatches a number of thugs to threaten Constantine in the hopes that she will back off. Constantine refuses. A third party, Kiandra Gallastan, learns of Alissas jealous plot and, sensing an opportunity to restore her family to the nobility, decides to exploit the situation. She hires a Calishite mage, Kadir Altair, to covertly heighten tensions between Constantine and Alissa. Her true plan is to have Constantine killed, and to pin the murder on her rival, Lord Zinzann Allison. With the Allison family disgraced, House Gallastan is sure to rise again.
