The mountain circle was a druid circle associated with grand terrain that reached for the sky. Druids who took up the cause of nature in such a region had an affinity for this circle and the suite of spells that came to them without cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).
Novice druids of such a domain learned how to cast spider climb and spike growth. Those who had become more skilled and wise in the ways of the circle could cast lightning bolt, meld into stone, stone shape, and stoneskin. Druids who had become very versed in the mountain circle could cast passwall and wall of stone.
