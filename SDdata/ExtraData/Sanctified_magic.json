(Sanctified*, as*)\n931192\nwikitext\ntext/x-wiki\n'''Sancitified magic''' was a type of magic.\n\nSanctified magic required the caster to be completely and utterly devoted to good. Sanctified spells were incredibly powerful. However, they could only be cast with a significant sacrifice from the caster. Evil spellcasters were unable to cast any sanctified spell.\n\nSanctified spells were prepared just as normal spells. Unprepared sanctified spells could only be used from a scroll. Sanctified spells usually required [[Verbal component|verbal]] and [[somatic component|somatic]] components but rarely a [[material component]]. Some also required a [[divine focus]]. All sanctified spells were temporary and expired.\n\nAll sanctified spells required a sacrifice from the caster. The sacrifice required varied, from a temporary draining of the caster's strength to their life itself. The sacrifice occured when the spell expired.\n\nA sanctified spell could be made into an item, such as a potion, scroll or wand. Any individual of good-alignment could use said item, and the required sacrifice was taken from them instead of the individual who created the item.\n\nSanctified spells were unique in that they were neither an [[Arcane magic|arcane]] nor a [[divine magic|divine]] spell. Good-aligned [[druid]]s, [[paladin]]s, [[ranger]]s, [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s could all cast a sanctified spell, but [[cleric]]s can spontaneously cast any sanctified spell.",
