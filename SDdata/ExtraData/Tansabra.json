Any internal wounds or bleeding were stopped as was its need for oxygen.\nWhen in the \"tansabra sleep\" the mammal didnt naturally heal and couldnt be affected by curative or healing magic. The duration of this state was different for each individual affected. Any means to reverse its effects, such as rare gem powders and herbs, were a matter of rumor and speculation.\nRepeated use of tansabra could prove to be lethal. This variable was only determined by the bodys tolerance for the number of times it could withstand entering tansabra sleep.\nCategoryDrugs\n8xrrfh53neb6duvaklj2f2x926jicye"
