        "Description": "Tansabra was formulated from the venom of several specific creatures.",
        "Usage": "To have its intended effect, tansabra had to be introduced into the user's bloodstream, by injection or other means.",
        "Effects": "When injected, the drug induced a systemic shutdown in the body of a mammal, temporarily ceasing all physiological processes along with the need for them to maintain the creature's life. Any internal wounds or bleeding were stopped as was its need for oxygen.\n\nWhen in the \"tansabra sleep\" the mammal didn't naturally heal and couldn't be affected by curative or healing magic. The duration of this state was different for each individual affected. Any means to reverse its effects, such as rare [[gem]] powders and [[herb]]s, were a matter of rumor and speculation.\n\nRepeated use of tansabra could prove to be lethal. This variable was only determined by the body's tolerance for the number of times it could withstand entering tansabra sleep.",
