The '''Calimshan Businessman's Embassy''' was a trade embassy for the nation of [[Calimshan]] in the city of [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
At some point, the embassy decided to commission a series of [[kukri]]s with minor [[enchantment]]s, later referred to as  ''[[Neverwinter kukri]]s''. These were meant to be given away by the embassy as gifts to people that the embassy viewed as culturally representing Calimshan in [[northwest Faer√ªn]].
