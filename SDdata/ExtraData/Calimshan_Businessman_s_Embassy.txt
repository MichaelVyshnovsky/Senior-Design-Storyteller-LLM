The Calimshan Businessmans Embassy was a trade embassy for the nation of Calimshan in the city of Neverwinter in the late 14 century DR.
At some point, the embassy decided to commission a series of kukris with minor enchantments, later referred to as  Neverwinter kukris. These were meant to be given away by the embassy as gifts to people that the embassy viewed as culturally representing Calimshan in northwest Faer√ªn.
