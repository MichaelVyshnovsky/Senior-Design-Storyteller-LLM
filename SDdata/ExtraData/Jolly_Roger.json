Some alternatively used the term skull and crossbones or, if feeling whimsical, pirates referred to it as \"the old flaggy waggy\".\nA Jolly Roger flag was traditionally black, with a depiction of a human skull and two crossed leg bones done in white.\nthumb|273px|These Inner Sea pirates fly their flag proudly.\nThis style of flag was used by pirates across much of the Sea of Fallen Stars, including those of the Pirate Isles.\n* Bartholomew Blackdagger, a notorious pirate king, wore a hat bearing the saber variant of the Jolly Roger.\n* Captain Morgan, a pirate captain that was infamous in Ravens Bluff, flew the skull and crossbones on his ship.\n* Nishan of the Nine Wonders, a pirate in the Sea of Fallen Stars, flew the Jolly Roger on his ship.\nThe origins of this style of flag and the name attributed to it were both a mystery, though many suggested that the term Jolly Roger may have derived from a corruption of Jhalanrojir, a Turmic word meaning \"mark of the rogue\" and the name of the legendary Pirateshield. This shield was fashioned from the shell of a blackback turtle that had apparently naturally formed the image of a skull and crossed bones on it."
