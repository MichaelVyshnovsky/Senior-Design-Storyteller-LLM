Wishing to combat these rumors, Vlard Bluegill hired a group of adventurers to investigate and determine what truly caused the sinking of the ship.Presented as a storyhook, Port of Ravens Bluff gives multiple potential actual causes for the sinking of the SS Stareyes. These ranged from it being caused by something that the ship was carrying, a pirate ship attacking it for the merchandise it was hauling, a rival ship getting rid of competition, and a rival maintenance wanting to discredit Vlard. In the case of the last possibility, the most likely culprit is said to be the Coker Wharf Company.\nCategoryShips and vehicles\nCategoryWatercraft\nCategoryShips\nCategoryItems from Ravens Bluff\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems\nCategoryShipwrecks\nCategoryLocations in the Dragon Reach\nCategoryLocations in the Sea of Swords\nCategoryLocations on Toril\noc5xrvi5ttlebru2qb7x6r6vavzrzcp"
