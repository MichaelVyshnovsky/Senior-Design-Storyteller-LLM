        "History": "Much speculation surrounded the sinking of the ''SS Stareyes'', with a common accusation being put on poor maintenance from the last dry dock to work on it, [[Vlard's Maintenance Yard]]. Wishing to combat these rumors, [[Vlard Bluegill]] hired a group of [[adventurer]]s to investigate and determine what truly caused the sinking of the ship.Presented as a storyhook, ''Port of Ravens Bluff'' gives multiple potential actual causes for the sinking of the ''SS Stareyes''. These ranged from it being caused by something that the ship was carrying, a pirate ship attacking it for the merchandise it was hauling, a rival ship getting rid of competition, and a rival maintenance wanting to discredit Vlard. In the case of the last possibility, the most likely culprit is said to be the [[Coker Wharf Company]].",
