Throwknife was a tavern game popular in northwest Faer√ªn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. Contestants took turns standing in a circle drawn on the floor and throwing a knife (or dagger, or whatever pointed weapon was agreed upon) at a target drawn on a nearby wall. A "best strike" game was a quick contest to see who could hit closest to the center of the target. If portions of the target were assigned point values, then a game of "forty-four" was played to earn a total of exactly 44 points by hitting areas with designated point values and summing. A strike that pushed a persons total over 44 was ignored.

Throwknife was one of the few games of pure skill at the Roaring Dragon House outside Waterdeep. House rules dictated that weapons could only be drawn while standing inside a throwknife circle.
