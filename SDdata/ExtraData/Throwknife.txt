'''Throwknife''' was a tavern game popular in [[northwest Faer√ªn]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. Contestants took turns standing in a circle drawn on the floor and throwing a knife (or [[dagger]], or whatever pointed weapon was agreed upon) at a target drawn on a nearby wall. A "best strike" game was a quick contest to see who could hit closest to the center of the target. If portions of the target were assigned point values, then a game of "forty-four" was played to earn a total of exactly 44 points by hitting areas with designated point values and summing. A strike that pushed a person's total over 44 was ignored.{{Cite dragon/320/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Roaring Dragon House|73}}

Throwknife was one of the few games of pure skill at the [[Roaring Dragon House]] outside [[Waterdeep]]. House rules dictated that weapons could only be drawn while standing inside a throwknife circle.
