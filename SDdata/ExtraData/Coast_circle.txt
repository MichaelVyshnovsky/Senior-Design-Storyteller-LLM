The coast circle was a druid circle associated with the transitional region between sea and land, teeming with life of infinite variety, beating with the pulse of waves crashing ashore. Druids who took up the cause of nature in such a region had an affinity for this circle and the suite of spells that came to them without cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).
Those new to the coast circle could cast the mirror image and misty step spells.
Druids who had more experience in this circle could cast water breathing, water walk,
control water, and freedom of movement. Druids that were very skilled in the coast circle could cast both conjure elemental and scrying.
