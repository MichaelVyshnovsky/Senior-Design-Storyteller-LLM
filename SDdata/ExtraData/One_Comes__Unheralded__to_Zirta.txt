"One Comes, Unheralded, to Zirta" by Ed Greenwood is a short story printed in The Best of the Realms II. It is, according to Greenwood, the very first tale of the Forgotten Realms, originally written in 1967.
The merchant Mirt and the warrior Durnan check in at an inn called The Banshee Laid Bare in Zirta, but trigger a lethal brawl. When it is over, several surprising visitors are revealed, all there for their own purposes.
