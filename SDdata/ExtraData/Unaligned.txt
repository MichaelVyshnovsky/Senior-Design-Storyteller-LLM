Being '''unaligned''' was the state of a lack of capacity for making moral decisions, whether that be due to reticence,<ref group="note">In 4{{th}} edition, "unaligned" replaced the [[neutral]] alignment of previous editions, though it was not technically the same.{{cite web | author = [[Bruce Cordell]] | title = Excerpts: Alignment. 4th Edition Player's Handbook  | url = http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ex/20080602a | quote = Being unaligned is ''not'' the neutral alignment of previous editions.}} or the natural inability to make such choices.

|You adventurin' cutters have a sayin' that sometimes it's 'Kill or be killed.'<br/>Well, the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] have their own sayin', 'Eat or be eaten.'<br/>It ain't good, it ain't evil, it's just how it is. Deal with it, berk.

|You are a mindless golem. I shall find no answers from you.
|An adventurer confronts a golem, who cannot think for itself.

Creatures lacking intelligence (or those who had [[animal]]-like intelligence) or sentience were unaligned. Even though some were savage, such as [[shark]]s, such creatures were only this way due to their bestial nature and predatory instincts.

In terms of reticence, unaligned individuals were ones who did not take a stand for either good, evil, or [[neutral|neutrality]]. Being unaligned indicated that someone may have been benign or undecided about their morality.{{cite web | author = [[Bruce Cordell]] | title = Excerpts: Alignment. 4th Edition Player's Handbook  | url = http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4ex/20080602a | quote = (...) unaligned is benign.}}

Objects, except those which were sentient, were unaligned. As such, a ''[[know alignment]]'' spell would reveal nothing about them.

==Notable Unaligned Creatures==
* [[Golem]]s and other [[construct]]s that lacked the ability to think for themselves.
* Typical [[animal]]s, from [[bat]]s to [[wolves]].
* Animal-like monstrosities, such as [[owlbear]]s and [[sea lion]]s.
* Some [[elemental]]s, such as [[flail snail]]s.
* [[Ooze]]s and other beings that resembled great supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies.
* Plants and plant-like creatures lacked sentience, and thus were unaligned.
