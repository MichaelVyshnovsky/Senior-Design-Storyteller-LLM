The Heralds of Faer√ªn had members in most cities of significant size or in locations where their services were in demand. Each local Herald was responsible for their city and usually the surrounding countryside as well. Each office had a unique name which the Herald used on official business, rather than their real name. In Cormyr, where the Heralds were an integral part of the government, the crown decided that Herald offices should be the same as the city in which they were based. Below is a table of the known local heralds. Location is usually the name of their city, but some Heralds wander about or ride a circuit. Sorting by Region will group them geographically.
