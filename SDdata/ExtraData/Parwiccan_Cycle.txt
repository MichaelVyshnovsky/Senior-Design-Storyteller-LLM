The '''''Parwiccan Cycle''''' was a compilation of ancient [[elven]] myths regarding the origins of [[dragon]]kind and the first interactions of elves and dragons.

The myths compiled in the ''Parwiccan Cycle'' told of the [[Tearfall]], among other events.

Many respected scholars, such as most of the sages of [[Candlekeep]], dismissed the ''Parwiccan Cycle'' as just a compilation of fancy elven mythology with no relationship with actual historical facts.
