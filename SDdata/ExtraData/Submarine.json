        "Description": "[[File:Scarlet marpenoth-5e.jpg|thumb|380x380px|''A [[mermaid]] observes a pair of [[drow]] on the Scarlet Marpenoth through one of its portholes.'']]\nSubmersibles were described by some as looking like strange [[galley]]s,{{Cite organized play/LC/A Kind of Magic|6}}<ref> whilst others had designs inspired by marine life.{{Cite organized play/LC/Eye of the Storm|6}} Though some also had a second hatch to allow for diving into the water or entering from the water.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Eye of the Storm|7,25}} Submarines tended to be able to accommodate most [[demihuman]]s, though their dimensions were typically designed with gnomes in mind.<ref>\n\nBeing enclosed watercraft designed for underwater traversal, submarines were pressurized in order to keep water from leaking in and flooding them.{{Cite organized play/LC/Eye of the Storm|7}} or by extending a metal tube above the water's surface to retrieve air.The other submarines discussed in this article did not have any details about interior lighting provided for them, though they likewise lacked any mention of players having trouble seeing whilst inside them.\n\nThese vessels were powered by a collection of complex and noisy machinery, sometimes quasi-[[magic]]al in nature and typically kept within a room separate from the main command room. These machines were what allowed for submarines to ascend, descend, change their direction, and be propelled through the watery depths. With these engines being in separate rooms from the command deck, metal speaking tubes were put in place to allow for swift communication between the two. Consequently, such machinery necessitated having one or more [[engineer]]s on a crew.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Eye of the Storm|25}}\n\nBesides the command room and engine room, submarines were typically large enough to have a handful of other rooms or quarters for the crew members.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Eye of the Storm|24}} For viewing the watery depths outside a submarine, there might be portholes, circular or dome-like windows fashioned from [[glass]] or [[glassteel]], typically within the command room. These rooms might also sport a \"periscope\", metal tubes that functioned similarly to [[spyglass]]es and could be raised or lowered at any time.",
        "History": "At some point a gnomish submarine operating in the [[Trackless Sea]] had a run-in with the [[storm giant]]s of [[Maelstrom (fortress)|Maelstrom]]. Pieces of the wreckage were kept by the giants in the fortress's study, while an ''[[apparatus of Kwalish]]'' that was recovered from the vessel's pressurized hold was placed within the royal treasury.",
        "Notable Submersibles": "[[File:BlueGlaucus.png|thumb|''The Blue Glaucus from the [[Moonshae Isles]].''|350x350px]]\n*''[[Blue Glaucus]]'': A submarine in the late 15{{th}} century DR that was captained by the [[fallen aasimar]] [[Aiden]] and a crew of [[goblin]]s.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 4|14-15}}\n*''The [[Great Fish]]'': a [[fish]]-shaped [[steel]] submarine designed by a gnome in [[the Vast]] known only as \"[[the Professor]]\". The hatch to enter it was only big enough for gnomes or [[halfling]]s to enter, rendering most of its crew to be gnomes. Sometime shortly after the [[War with Myrkyssa Jelan]], the Professor showed up to Ravens Bluff and loaned it to a group of adventurers in their efforts to reach the [[beholder mage]] [[XAXANTHRAXIS]] before he could destroy their city.\n*''[[RBNS Nautilus]]'': one of two submersibles that were owned by the reformed [[Ravens Bluff Naval Militia]] long after the War.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Kind of Magic|7}}\n*''[[Sea Voyager]]'': another [[fish]]-shaped submarine. Made of [[brass]] and steel, it was designed by [[Leapold Manfeld]], a gnome engineer in the Vast in the 14{{th}} century DR, who maintained a crew of halflings. During the War with Myrkyssa Jelan, the ''Sea Voyager'' was used by the [[Ravens Bluff Army]] to retrieve a group that had been sent behind enemy lines on an infiltration mission.\n*The ''[[underwater boat]]'', a small submersible developed by [[Nadul DaRoni]] that was self-propelled and could only seat a single individual.\n*'''unnamed precursor to the ''Sea Voyager''''': Sometime prior to the War with Myrkyssa Jelan, Leapold had designed another steel submarine.{{Cite organized play/LC/One Thing...|20-21}} This one was built to utilize a steam engine, what his home village called the \"Grand Design\". Early tests with this machinery caused him and his crew to pass out, as the [[coal]] burnt by the engine would use up all oxygen inside the enclosed space. Though this effect was observed, the only thing Leapold understood of the process was that fire was somehow involved. Seeking a new source of heat, he returned to his mountain village in hopes that they might help him explore a nearby hot cave, but the villagers were reluctant to aid him. A group of [[adventurer]]s visiting at the time agreed to do the exploration for him, in return for helping clear the [[Ravens Bluff Harbor]] of a recent shipwreck.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/One Thing...|6}} This submarine was later lost, along with all of its crew except for Leapold himself.\n*''[[Scarlet Marpenoth]]'', a submarine shaped like a [[manta ray]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. A miniature model of it was kept on display in the [[House of Inspired Hands]]. The vessel later fell into the possession of the [[mercenary]] [[Jarlaxle]], who maintained a crew of [[rock gnome]]s that were very knowledgeable about submarines.\n* '''Unnamed submersible of the Absolute''': Sometime in the late 15{{th}} century DR, a clan of [[svirfneblin]] enslaved by [[Enver Gortash]] were forced to construct a submersible for the purpose of accessing [[Iron Throne headquarters]] that laid sunken beneath the depths of [[Gray Harbor]]. Wanting to use the discrete location as a hidden prison for the [[Cult of the Absolute]], Enver had the abandoned building retrofitted with a metallic, cross-shaped structure atop its tower with a hatch that allowed for entrance from his submersible. This submersible featured interior lighting, a manta ray-like design, and utilized [[oil]]. During the time in which it operated the submersible was leaking oil into Gray Harbor, causing local [[fish]] to die, and in [[1492 DR]] the [[Umberlant]] [[Holli Dylford]] died from being rammed into by the submersible.",
