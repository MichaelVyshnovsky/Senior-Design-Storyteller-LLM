Runemeet was a holy day of Uthgar, held on the autumn equinox when the Uthgardt tribes traveled to their respective ancestor mounds (or to Beorunnas Well, the holiest of all) for rites, pacts, and communing with ancestors.
This day was when juveniles who sought recognition as full tribe members proved themselves by hunting their tribes ritual enemies.
Although Uthgardt ceremonies could be performed anywhere, the Thunderbeast tribe believed it could not stay strong without an ancestor mound.
