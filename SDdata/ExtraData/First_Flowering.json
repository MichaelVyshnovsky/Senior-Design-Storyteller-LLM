At the start of this period, the [[elf|elves]] had split into five major realms: [[Aryvandaar]], [[Illefarn]], [[Keltormir]], [[Miyeritar]] and [[Shantel Othreier]], as well as several smaller ones such as [[Eiellûr]], [[Ilythiir]], [[Orishaar]], [[Syòrpiir]] and [[Thearnytaar]]. During the First Flowering, the last of the winged elven race of the [[avariel]] are believed to have left Faerûn.",
        "Timeline": "; Around {{Yearlink|-24000}}\n: Yuan-ti ruled [[Mhairshaulk]] has all but collapsed, thanks to repeated assaults on its cities by the great wyrms of the south.\n: Called into service by the god [[Ubtao]], an army of winged serpents known as couatls arrive in the [[Chult|Jungles of Chult]] from an unknown continent to the west. For centuries the couatl and the yuan-ti battle each other for control of the Chultan Peninsula. Time and again the yuan-ti are forced to concede their westernmost holdings to the couatl, until the war ends in a stalemate with the Hazur Mountains as the dividing line. \n: '''End of the Time of Dragons.''' Following the first [[Rage of Dragons]], the surviving elves establish the [[Dracorage mythal|Dracorage Mythal]] in the far north of Faerûn to prevent the dragons from again taking control of Faerûn and enslaving the other races.\n: '''The First Flowering.''' Following the destruction of the First Sundering, the elven people begin to settle into five major civilizations across [[Faerûn]]. With the elves' success against the orcs, dragons and giants, the other races thrive in safety and also begin the slow climb on civilization.\n\n; {{Yearlink|-23900}}\n: The forest community of [[Sharlarion]] survived the First Sundering nearly intact. As the elves multiplied, they migrated into neighboring forests, hills, and lowland regions. Soon the gold elf kingdom of [[Aryvandaar]], in the present day [[High Forest]] is established.\n\n; {{Yearlink|-23600}}\n: Establishment of the first settlements of the gold elf and moon elf kingdom of [[Shantel Othreier]] in the Green Fields.\n: An outpost of [[Shantel Othreier]] is established in the [[Ardeep Forest]] by the moon elves.\n\n; {{Yearlink|-23200}}\n: Establishment of the first settlements of [[Ilythiir]] in the [[Shaar]] and [[Forest of Amtar]].\n\n; {{Yearlink|-23100}}\n: Establishment of the settlements of [[Syòrpiir]] in what will become the [[Ankhwood]] and [[Chondalwood]].\n\n; {{Yearlink|-22900}}\n: First settlements of the kingdom of [[Illefarn]] are founded in Ardeep and Kryptgarden Forests, and parts of the [[River Dessarin|Dessarin valley]].

Hundreds of [[High Magi]] gathered in the heartland of [[Faerûn]] at the Gathering Place. Ignoring the lesson learned from the destruction of Tintageer centuries earlier, the High Magi cast a spell designed to create a glorious elven homeland. As the Day of Birthing dawned, the spell reached its apex. The unbridled force of the spell sundered Faerûn, the one land, apart. As a result, hundreds of cities were washed away, thousands of elves lay dead, and the face of Abeir-Toril was changed forever. The name Faerûn, no longer the one land, was given to largest continent and [[Evermeet]], Island of Elves, was created.\n* The [[Tree of Souls]] is given to the elves.\n\n; {{Yearlink|-17500}}\n: The independent sylvan realms of [[Thearnytaar]], [[Eiellûr]], and [[Syòrpiir]] open discussions of unifying the elves of the [[Satyrwood]].\n\n; {{Yearlink|-17100}}\n* Start Of The [[War Of Three Leaves]]. The unification of the [[Satyrwood]] is thwarted by dark elven Ilythiiri spies and assassins, killing their leaders and framing opposing heirs, driving the three realms to a multi-front war. Ilythiir's influence is not discovered for centuries.\n\n; {{Yearlink|-16900}}\n: Numerous elves abandon the surface realms of [[Eiellûr]] and [[Syòrpiir]] during the War of Three Leaves to settle in the [[Selmal Basin]] ([[Vilhon Reach]]). This begins the elven migrations, which continue for seven millennia.\n\n; {{Yearlink|-16800}}\n: End Of The War Of Three Leaves. [[Thearnytaar]], [[Eiellûr]], and [[Syòrpiir]] remain separate realms after peace is restored, though each of the three continue skirmishes among themselves and with [[Ilythiir]] for centuries.\n\n; {{Yearlink|-15300}}\n: The [[Vyshaan]] clan rises to power in [[Aryvandaar]] under [[Coronal]] [[Ivósaar Vyshaan]].\n\n; {{Yearlink|-14700}}\n: [[Aryvandaar]]'s rulers begin attempts to diplomatically and peacefully annex [[Miyeritar]] into their realm and under their control.\n\n; Circa [[-14,000 DR]]\n: Tribal barbarian clans of humans, known as the [[Talfir]], roam [[Keltormir]], hiding and hunting in the great forests and avoiding the greater races of elves, giants, and dragons.<ref>\n: The Second Epoch (Time of the Elves). The Second Epoch of [[Serôs]] officially begins with the building of the undersea capital of [[Aryselmalyr]], and ends with forty years of war between the sea elves and other undersea races. It is also during this Epoch that the first land-dwellers began exploration of the waters, the initial migrations of shalarin into the Inner Sea, and the trapping of the sahuagin behind the [[Sharksbane Wall]].\n\n; {{Yearlink|-13900}}\n: [[Miyeritar]] becomes the center for elven Art and [[High Magic]] on [[Faerûn]].\n\n; {{Yearlink|-13200}}\n: Skirmishing and trade interference starts between [[Aryvandaar]] and [[Miyeritar]]."
