        "mainbody": "aeqeshel was a bardic art known to very few drow. Wielders of baeqeshel were known as the \"dark minstrels.\" The song was keening and magical.\nUnlike divine magic, dark minstrels tapped into the Weave, and did not require a connection with a deity to wield it. However, according to Halisstra, it was sung in honor to Lolth.\nThe songs had a wide range of effects, often involving compulsion and other enchantments, but they also had more reality-altering abilities such as healing grievous wounds, creating dimension doors, and producing sonic blasts capable of stripping bark off of trees, as shown by Halisstra.\n* Halisstra Melarn She was one of the few learned in baeqeshel, as it was a secret tradition for chosen female drow in House Melarn in Ched Nasad until the houses destruction."
