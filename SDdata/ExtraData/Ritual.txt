A '''ritual''' was a complex ceremony that created magical effects. 

==History==
Rituals were as old as [[magic]] use itself.

===Days of Thunder===
The [[sarrukh]] used one of the first rituals to create large numbers of reptilian creatures during the [[Days of Thunder]].

===Age of Humanity===

In the 12{{th}} century [[DR]], some time before the [[Time of Troubles]],{{ShatteredStatue-pasttime}} the [[adept]]s of the [[College of Rune Magics]] practiced a form of [[rune magic]] that heavily revolved around the use of ''[[runestick]]s'' in casting a wide variety of rituals.

===Era of Upheaval===
Following the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], magic use changed the way rituals functioned. Rituals were now set forth in writing and followed specific guidelines.
