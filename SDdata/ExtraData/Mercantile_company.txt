'''Mercantile companies''' were organizations primarily focused on trade between the cities and nations of [[Faerûn]] and greater [[Toril]]. For this purpose, mercantile companies often ran caravans over trade routes and/or had one or more [[:Category:Ships|ships]] to carry goods over water. Depending on their size, they might also own warehouses and stables, and employ their own guards. In general, there were two types of mercantile companies: the priakos and the coster. By the late 1400s DR, the term "priakos" was used less and less while "coster" was becoming more common.

==Priakos==
A priakos was a mercantile company formed from a conglomeration of smaller caravan companies under one banner. They usually dominated or strongly competed for dominance of a trade route because of their size. Some notable priakos in history were:
* [[Crimson Sea Maritime Priakos]]: Actually a front for smuggling that dominated [[Chessenta]]'s sea trade for a time.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|72}}
* [[Iron Throne]]: Enigmatic trading company used questionable tactics and manipulated markets for political and financial gain.
* [[Merchant's League]]: Based in [[Baldur's Gate]] and dealt in weapons. Rival of the Iron Throne.
* [[Six Coffers Market Priakos]]: Operated in [[northwest Faerûn]] through the [[Dragon Coast]] and [[Sembia]].
* [[Trueshield Trading Priakos]]: Operated out of [[Tilpur]] around [[interior Faerûn]].
* [[Zhentarim]]: A mercenary company that became a mercantile power in the [[Western Heartlands]], driven by religious zealots with a goal of tyranny over all of Faerûn.

==Costers==
Costers were companies that gathered smaller merchants together to form temporary or permanent alliances focused on safety and protection while traveling. Typical services provided included wagons, beasts of burden, guards, guides, and warehouse space. A few of the many notable costers in history were:
* [[Dragoneye Dealing Coster]]: Founded in the [[Vilhon Reach]], this coster expanded to [[Iriaebor]] and [[Elturel]].
* [[Firehands Group]]: Operated out of [[Daerlun]], focused primarily on trade between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Sembia]].
* [[Highmoon Trading Coster]]: Based in [[Scornubel]] and Waterdeep, this coster cornered the [[Sword Coast]] market on [[kaorph]] wine and some [[spices]].
* [[Red Shields]]: Both a mercenary and mercantile company, also based in Scornubel.
* [[Seven Suns Trading Coster]]: A cut-rate operation that connected many corners of Faerûn.
* [[Thousandheads Trading Coster]]: Specialized in trade between Waterdeep and [[Hillsfar]]. Based near [[Riatavin]].
