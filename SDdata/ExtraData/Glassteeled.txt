A glassteeled item was any object granted steel-like durability by the glassteel spell.
While a material known as glassteel existed, there were numerous examples of objects that rather than having been created out of glassteel, had been treated with a hardening spell known as glassteel (or even Trobriands glassteel) glassteel-treated creations were explicitly only as strong as steel.
While glass itself was the most common obvious of glassteel spells, it was not the only material susceptible to such reinforcement. Crystals, too, could be affected by the spellAs most minerals are glass or crystal, there are few apparent limits on the spell. and obscure versions, such as Trobriands glassteel may have lacked even those limitations.See spell article. In fact, even the metal adamant was affected by the magic, and equipment made of such had been enchanted successfully.
*Chalcedony statues present in Vanrakdoom had been treated with Trobriands glassteel to attain ferrous durability.
*A ruby used as the phylactery of Greshrukk after treatment, and the shield of the Red Knight was made in the same way. 
*Emerald-colored marble had been glassteeled in the Emerald Canopy of the Cathedral of Emerald Scales.
*A rogue stone was treated for use as the phylactery of Dretchroyaster.
*The Diamond Staff of Chomylla had been reinforced with the spell. 
*The Moonstone Shard in the House of the Moon was reinforced moonstone.
A very specific case, tinted glassteel was created by the arcane and sold to spacefaring drow. The spell was modified so that the object, rather than transparent, was only partially transparent from one side, and resembled steel from the other. A helmet of light-seeing, which made light bearable to drow eyes, required this material.
