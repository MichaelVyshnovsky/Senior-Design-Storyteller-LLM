A '''glassteeled''' item was any object granted steel-like durability by the ''[[glassteel (spell)|glassteel]]'' spell.

==Differences with Glassteel==
While a material known as [[glassteel]] existed,{{cite book/Races of Faerun|158}} there were numerous examples of objects that rather than having been created out of glassteel, had been treated with a hardening spell known as ''[[glassteel (spell)|glassteel]]'' (or even ''[[Trobriand's glassteel]]''){{cite book/Champions of Valor|65}} ''glassteel''-treated creations were explicitly only as strong as steel.

==Applicable Materials==
While glass itself was the most common obvious of ''glassteel'' spells, it was not the only material susceptible to such reinforcement. Crystals, too, could be affected by the spellAs most minerals are glass or crystal, there are few apparent limits on the spell. and obscure versions, such as ''Trobriand's glassteel'' may have lacked even those limitations.See spell article. In fact, even the metal [[adamant]] was affected by the magic, and equipment made of such had been enchanted successfully.{{Cite dragon/71/Greyhawk's World|22}}

==Notable Examples in the Realms==
*[[Chalcedony]] statues present in [[Vanrakdoom]] had been treated with ''[[Trobriand's glassteel]]'' to attain ferrous durability.{{Cite web enhancement/Vanrakdoom|15}}
*A [[ruby]] used as the [[phylactery]] of [[Greshrukk]] after treatment,{{cite book/Cult of the Dragon|55}} and the shield of the [[Red Knight]] was made in the same way.{{cite book/Powers and Pantheons|45}} 
*[[Emerald]]-colored [[marble]] had been glassteeled in the [[Emerald Canopy]] of the [[Cathedral of Emerald Scales]].{{cite book/Powers and Pantheons|87, 141}}
*A ''[[rogue stone]]'' was treated for use as the phylactery of [[Dretchroyaster]].{{cite book/Cult of the Dragon|51}}
*The ''[[Diamond Staff of Chomylla]]'' had been reinforced with the spell.{{cite book/Cult of the Dragon|50}} 
*The [[Moonstone Shard]] in the [[House of the Moon]] was reinforced [[moonstone]].{{cite book/Powers and Pantheons|163}}

==Tinted Glassteel==
A very specific case, ''tinted glassteel'' was created by the [[arcane (race)|arcane]] and sold to spacefaring [[drow]]. The spell was modified so that the object, rather than transparent, was only partially transparent from one side, and resembled steel from the other. A ''[[helmet of light-seeing]]'', which made light bearable to drow eyes, required this material.{{Cite dungeon/45/An Artist's Errand|11}}
