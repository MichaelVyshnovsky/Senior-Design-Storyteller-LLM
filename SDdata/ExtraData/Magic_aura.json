        "mainbody": "magic aura or magical aura was a type of aura, an invisible property that indicated the strength and nature of the magic possessed by a magical item or a spell, and by certain mages.\nThe detect magic spell allowed a spellcaster to examine magical auras in their vicinity.\nArcane spellcasters could also possess a magic aura, and this revealed their nature and make-up to other mages. Such auras could also be passed down through family lines. For example, the wizard Kyriani Agrivar bore the magic aura of her father, the renowned wizard Ostus Agrivar. This allowed Kyriani to control the Great Door that Ostus had created and only he and co-creator Parwyyd Hanifar could control. Parwyyd described Kyrianis magic aura as \"odd\", owing to her complex origin as a re-merger of the divided being Cybriana and Kilili.\nCategoryMagic\ncr3fwbi12qsddjru7mzg3ss70bojziu"
