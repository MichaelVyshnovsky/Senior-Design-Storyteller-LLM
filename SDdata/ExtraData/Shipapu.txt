Shipapu was a prominent location within the folklore and myth of the Azuposi people of the Pasocada Basin of northern Maztica.
Shipapu was a passage that connected the underworld with the "True World." The bird  Motsni used Shipapu to leave the underworld in search for a new land suitable for the Azuposi to live. The Azuposi also believed that when they died Masauwu would guide their spirit to the underworld through Shipapu.
