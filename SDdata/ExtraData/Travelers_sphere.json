These spells eased the burdens of traveling and helped promote safety.\nAs they advanced, the spellcaster learned spells that aided in navigation, such as know direction and helping hand, and made travel easier, like aura of comfort, lighten load, and easy march. Know customs let them understand the areas they passed through. They also acquired spells that assisted in camping, such as create campsite/break camp and circle of privacy. They could also gain mounts with tree steed and monster mount.
