'''''Tower of iron will''''' was a [[psionic]] science of the [[telepathy]] [[discipline]] that allowed the [[psionicist]] to utterly protect their mind.

==Effects==
The ''tower of iron will power'' was perhaps the best psionic defense a psionicist could deploy against psionic attacks. The best attack that had a chance of penetrating it was the ''[[id insinuation]]''.
