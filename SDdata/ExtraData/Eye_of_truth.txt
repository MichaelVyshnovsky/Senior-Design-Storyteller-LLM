The '''eye of truth''' was a special ritual used by [[sha'ir]]s to enhance their [[gen]]'s vision.

==Preparation==
The sha'ir needed to provide a pair of [[ruby|rubies]] worth at least 300 [[dinar]]s each. The eye of truth ritual took 24 hours to complete.

If successful this ritual granted the gen the permanent ability to see through magical illusions. The chance of a gen being able to see through an illusion increased based upon how powerful their sha'ir was during the ritual.
