The '''Golden Age of Netheril''' was the era of [[Netheril]] when that empire was at the peak of its power. It was counted by most sages as the fifth age.

==Description==
The Age was said to have begun with the birth of [[Jeriah Chronos]] in [[Netheril Year]] 1652, which corresponds to {{Yearlink|-2207}} in the [[Dalereckoning]]. It extended for a millennium until 2654 NY/{{Yearlink|-1206}}, the year before ''[[chardalyn]]'' was first discovered, ushering in the [[Age of Discovery]].

During this time, Netheril was at its most powerful. There was even a stretch of time where one city was being raised into the sky as a flying enclave every year until there was a total of dozens of them moving around the empire on air currents.

As this Age progressed, citizens of [[High Netheril]] had less and less say in their lives, being governed solely by the whims of the [[archwizard]] who had raised their city.

For their part, it was during this age that many archwizards began to use their magic to explore the [[planes of existence]], particularly the [[Inner Planes]].
