The Golden Age of Netheril was the era of Netheril when that empire was at the peak of its power. It was counted by most sages as the fifth age.
The Age was said to have begun with the birth of Jeriah Chronos in Netheril Year 1652, which corresponds to  in the Dalereckoning. It extended for a millennium until 2654 NY/, the year before chardalyn was first discovered, ushering in the Age of Discovery.
During this time, Netheril was at its most powerful. There was even a stretch of time where one city was being raised into the sky as a flying enclave every year until there was a total of dozens of them moving around the empire on air currents.
As this Age progressed, citizens of High Netheril had less and less say in their lives, being governed solely by the whims of the archwizard who had raised their city.
For their part, it was during this age that many archwizards began to use their magic to explore the planes of existence, particularly the Inner Planes.
