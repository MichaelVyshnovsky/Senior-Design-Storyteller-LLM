The '''Aryselmalyn calendar''' is an example of how all elven nations marked the passage of time (and still do in [[Evereska]] and [[Evermeet]]). It was used by the ancient and fallen [[Aquatic elf]] nation of [[Aryselmalyr]].

Four years marked one ''aeloulaev'' ("when peaces meet" in [[elven (language)|elven]]) which ended during the celebration of ''Cinnaelos'Cor'' ("The Day of Corellon's Peace") and started a new one. The elves also marked time by the length of the reign of their rulers, known as a ''rysar'' which encompassed the entire reign of a single ruler of Aryselmalyr.

When Aryselmalyr fell over 1500 years ago{{timescale}}, the calendar had reached the 71st ''aeloulaeva'' of its 197th ''rysar'', which sages later agreed added up to over 11000 years.<ref>
