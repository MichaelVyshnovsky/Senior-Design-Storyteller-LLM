A monastery was a type of religious community consisting of a building or complex of buildings.
Monasteries with a solely female clergy were referred to as a nunnery. The mixed clergy exceptions to this were the Church of Sharess and Church of Sune.
Monasteries always incorporated a temple and living quarters as part of their design. They were often walled in and usually had some means of sustaining themselves, such as a farm, sheep pastures, or by cultivating mushrooms in caverns. They also typically had some means of supporting themselves monetarily, such as a mill or tannery, producing goods they could sell to generate income.
These communities were places of learning and strength, offering inhabitants peace and isolation from the outside world To this end, inhabitants could receive religious instruction and in some cases harsh training in martial arts, learning how to be skilled at fighting without the use of armor and weapons.
