A '''monastery''' was a type of religious community consisting of a building or complex of buildings.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/Definitions of Religious Buildings}}

==Etymology==
Monasteries with a solely female clergy were referred to as a '''nunnery'''. The mixed clergy exceptions to this were the [[Church of Sharess]] and [[Church of Sune]].

==Description==
Monasteries always incorporated a temple and living quarters as part of their design. They were often walled in and usually had some means of sustaining themselves, such as a farm, [[sheep]] pastures, or by cultivating [[mushroom]]s in caverns. They also typically had some means of supporting themselves monetarily, such as a [[gristmill|mill]] or tannery, producing goods they could sell to generate income.

==Monastic Life==
These communities were places of learning and strength, offering inhabitants peace and isolation from the outside world To this end, inhabitants could receive religious instruction and in some cases harsh training in [[:Category:martial arts|martial arts]], learning how to be skilled at fighting without the use of [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s.

Those who dwelled in monasteries were [[avenger]]s,{{cite book/Player's Handbook 2|32}} [[shugenja]], [[sohei]],{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades}} and most typically [[monk]]s or monastic [[priest]]s. They would live on site for years at a time or for the rest of their lives. However, monasteries were also open to anyone who required advice, assistance, or shelter. And in [[Kozakura]] particularly, monasteries in peaceful areas were often seen as a fashionable place of retirement by emperors, nobles, noble widows, and [[samurai]]. The number of people who lived at a monastery varied, but it could go as high as over three thousand people.

Those who lived in monasteries did so under a strict regimen of routine rituals and prayer. They also worked to advance the influence and wealth of their faith's priesthood. Though monasteries devoted to [[evil]] [[deities]] would often selfishly hoard knowledge and wealth for their own order's use.

In some nations that had theocratic governments, such as the [[Kuong Kingdom]] and [[Ra-Khati]], monasteries served as administrative centers.

===Faiths===
Faiths in [[Faer√ªn]] that were noted as having monasteries included the [[Church of Amaunator]], [[Church of Deneir]], [[Church of Helm]], [[Church of Ilmater]], [[Church of Loviatar]], [[Church of Oghma]],<ref> Church of Sharess, and Church of Sune.

In the continent of [[Kara-Tur]], faiths that were noted as having monasteries included the [[Eight Million Gods]], the [[Path of Enlightenment]], and [[the Way]].

==Monastery Sites==
Monasteries were generally built in secluded or remote locations,

They could be found throughout all of [[Toril]], though most commonly in [[Amn]], [[Calimshan]], [[Damara]], Kara-Tur, the [[Lake of Steam (region)|Lake of Steam]] region, [[Mulhorand]], and [[Silverymoon]].

In the continent of Kara-Tur monasteries could particularly be found in [[Khazari]], Kozakura, [[Laothan]],{{Cite dragon/315/Kara-Tur: Ancestor Feats and Martial Arts Styles|62-63}} in each major town of Ra-Khati (dedicated to the Padhran faith), [[Tabot]], and [[Wa]].<ref>

Beyond the [[Prime Material plane]], [[githzerai]] built monasteries in the [[plane]]s of [[Limbo]] and [[Warrior's Rest]].<ref> And on the [[Solania]] layer of [[Mount Celestia]], one could find monasteries that were under the control of [[demigod]]s.
