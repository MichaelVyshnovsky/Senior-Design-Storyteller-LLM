The Hindhorn Hills was a rolling area of scrub woodlands, small cliffs and deep ravines northwest of Secomber. It was not marked on many maps. The area contained many deer, hares and hawks, but also dangerous wolves, gnolls and orcs. It was notable for being the site of the planned village of New Dawn.
