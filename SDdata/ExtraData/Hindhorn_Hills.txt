The '''Hindhorn Hills''' was a rolling area of scrub woodlands, small cliffs and deep ravines northwest of [[Secomber]]. It was not marked on many maps. The area contained many [[deer]], [[hare]]s and [[hawk]]s, but also dangerous [[wolves]], [[gnoll]]s and [[orc]]s. It was notable for being the site of the planned village of [[New Dawn]].
