'''Place spirits''', also known as the '''spirits of the earth''' or '''little gods''', were [[nature spirit]]s that inhabited the natural landmarks and locales of the [[Anauroch]] desert known as 'places of power'. They were worshiped as quasi-divine beings by the people of the [[Bedine]] tribes.

==Description==
While they were rarely encountered by mortals, place spirits were entirely real and substantive on [[Toril]]. They each inhabited a different landmark each―such as an [[:category:oases|oasis]], [[:Category:Mountains|mountain]], or [[:category:mesas|mesa]]―and did not travel beyond their place of power.

Place spirits could be slain just like any [[demipower]]. If the spirit of any place was destroyed, a whole calendar year would have to pass before a new one could reform. 

==Powers==
Place spirits held strong prescience over all activity that occurred on or around their landmark up to {{SI|1|mi}} away. They could communicate verbally or ''[[telepathy|telpathically]]'' with anyone upon their land, appear as manifestations, or create 'focal point's in the heart of their place of power. Some spirits could only manifest in a single instance at once while others could form two manifestations. 

The spirits could also transfer between their places on the [[Prime Material plane]] to their corresponding locations within the [[ethereal plane]]. 

===Magic===
While they were highly resistant to [[magic]], place spirits could imbue anyone within their territory limited [[spellcaster|spellcasting]] power up to a certain level. Additionally, they could perform wondrous feats for their worshipers once or several times per day as they so decided. Place spirits were capable of ''[[regenerate|healing wounds]]'', ''[[restoration|restoring a person's life essence]]'', ''[[raise dead|brining the dead back to life]]'', and even ''[[limited wish|grant wishes]]'' to their faithful.

==Relationships==
The Bedine tribes of Anauroch were well-versed in the lore of the desert's place spirits and respected the power they held. The spirits themselves appreciated the respect and worship the Bedine offered and were tolerant of non-violent outlanders.

==Notable Place Spirits==
* [[El Ma'ra Dat-ur Ojhogo]], the "tall god who let's men sit upon his head" of the [[El Ma'ra]] oasis and mesa.
* [[Rahalat]], the Bedine [[sorceress]] whose spirit resided within an oasis after she was murdered by her own people.
