The Tomb of Annihilation season is set in Chult, with the added difficulty that until Acererak is defeated, any characters who die while playing cannot be raised from the dead, and if they had been before the season started, they would lose health every in-game day until they died or Acererak was defeated. It is thematically linked to Tomb of Annihilation.
