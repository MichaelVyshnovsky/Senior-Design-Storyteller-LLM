[[File:Tomb of Annihilation Logo.jpg|thumb]]
The ''Tomb of Annihilation'' season is set in [[Chult]], with the added difficulty that until [[Acererak]] is defeated, any characters who die while playing cannot be raised from the dead, and if they had been before the season started, they would lose health every in-game day until they died or Acererak was defeated. It is thematically linked to ''[[Tomb of Annihilation]]''.
