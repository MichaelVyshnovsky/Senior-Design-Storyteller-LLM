        "Divinity": "Up until the [[Time of Troubles]], the pharaohs of Mulhorand were physical incarnations of [[Horus-Re]], the solar [[deity]] who bore the title of \"Pharaoh of the Gods\".

They would also be an incarnation of Horus-Re, such that the title of pharaoh could be passed down to him.",
        "Requirements": "All of Mulhorand's pharaohs were required to be male. They were also expected to be members of the [[House of Helcaliant]], the priestly House of Horus-Re, and thus descendants of an incarnation of the god.",

        "Burial": "In both the nations of Bakar and Mulhorand, pharaohs were buried in elaborate tombs.\n\nIn Mulhorand, a pharaoh's family was traditionally buried with them and their tombs were situated in the [[Land of the Dead]], part of the valley [[Great Vale|Asanibis]] on the edge of the [[Dragonsword Mountains]],",
        "History": "Long after the kingdom of Bakar had fallen to ruin, legends of its pharaohs still circulated in the Raurin Desert. According to some, the pharaohs of Bakar were evil, while others claimed they were largely benevolent rulers.\n\nThe only pharaohs in the history of Mulhorand who were not an incarnation of Horus-Re were two incarnations of [[Thoth]] who ruled for a short time after the loss of [[Thay]].
