The title was also used in the land of Raurin for the leaders of Bakar.\nUp until the Time of Troubles, the pharaohs of Mulhorand were physical incarnations of Horus-Re, the solar deity who bore the title of \"Pharaoh of the Gods\".  The pharaohs family members were also considered incarnations, though of the other deities of the Mulhorandi pantheon. The exception to this was the firstborn son. They would also be an incarnation of Horus-Re, such that the title of pharaoh could be passed down to him.\nAll of Mulhorands pharaohs were required to be male. They were also expected to be members of the House of Helcaliant, the priestly House of Horus-Re, and thus descendants of an incarnation of the god.\nThe pharaoh of Mulhorand ruled from his throne in the city of Skuld. While the most powerful individual in Mulhorand in name, most pharaohs allowed the priests to determine most of its policies, The official second-in-command under the pharaoh was the vizier, who was the highest-ranking cleric in the Church of Horus-Re.\nWhen a new pharaoh took the throne, typically, a census would be his first act.\nIn both the nations of Bakar and Mulhorand, pharaohs were buried in elaborate tombs.\nIn Mulhorand, a pharaohs family was traditionally buried with them and their tombs were situated in the Land of the Dead, part of the valley Asanibis on the edge of the Dragonsword Mountains,\nLong after the kingdom of Bakar had fallen to ruin, legends of its pharaohs still circulated in the Raurin Desert. According to some, the pharaohs of Bakar were evil, while others claimed they were largely benevolent rulers.\nThe only pharaohs in the history of Mulhorand who were not an incarnation of Horus-Re were two incarnations of Thoth who ruled for a short time after the loss of Thay. This period of Mulhorands history lasted from 922 DR to 955 DR.\nFollowing the Time of Troubles, the overgod Ao finally dispersed the Imaskari planar barrier that separated the Mulhorandi gods manifestations from their divine essences in the Outer Planes. As a result of their reunion, the then-pharaoh Horustep III and all his family members lost the fragments of divinity that were previously within them, reducing them to mere mortals with divine lineage.\n* Amun-Re, the last pharaoh of Bakar.\n* Horusret I, the first pharaoh of Mulhorand. His reign lasted from -1045 DR to -926 DR.\n* Akonhorus II, pharaoh in 1320 DR\n* Horuseres II, the fifth pharaoh\n* Horustep III, the sixteenth pharaoh of Mulhorand and the first to be a mortal rather than an incarnation of a god.\n* Ramenhorus III, the twelfth pharaoh of Mulhorand. His reign lasted from 955 DR to 1098 DR, dying from the forces of Thay in their first attempted invasion.\n* Thothibistep I, the ninth pharaoh of Mulhorand and the first to be the physical incarnation of a god other than Horus-Re.\n* Thothibistep II, the tenth pharaoh of Mulhorand and the second to last pharaoh to be an incarnation of the god Thoth.\n* \nCategoryTitles\nCategoryMulhorandi titles\ntalqztxhxorchjvp05oi34r7r3xzns8"
