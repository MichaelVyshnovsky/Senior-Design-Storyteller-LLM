He proceeded to offer the proprietress, famed madam Nauloene Tharantra, a commission of twenty dragons for each girl who agreed to marry one of the seadogs. Each bride was to receive ten thousand dragons as a dowry in reverse. Only two of the ladies of the evening turned down the offer and a wild celebration with drinking and dancing ensued.\nAt some point in the revels, Starankh set fire to the festhall and it burned beyond the point of salvation. The relatively fancy Arrowsar Apartments were eventually built on the site of the former festhall.\nCategoryEvents on Snail Street\nCategoryEvents in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep\nCategoryEvents in Waterdeep\nCategoryEvents in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryEvents on the Sword Coast North\nCategoryEvents in Faerûn\nCategoryEvents on Toril\nCategoryEvents\nntwd7l81bh842sbwglpry01ai720412"
