He proceeded to offer the proprietress, famed madam [[Nauloene Tharantra]], a commission of twenty [[Dragon (coin)|dragons]] for each girl who agreed to marry one of the seadogs. Each bride was to receive ten thousand dragons as a dowry in reverse. Only two of the ladies of the evening turned down the offer and a wild celebration with drinking and dancing ensued.\n\nAt some point in the revels, Starankh set fire to the festhall and it burned beyond the point of salvation. The relatively fancy [[Arrowsar Apartments]] were eventually built on the site of the former festhall.{{Cite web/Waterdeep News/Tharantra Husband-Hunting Again}}",
