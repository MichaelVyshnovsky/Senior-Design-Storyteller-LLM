        "Early History": {
            "Prehistory": "Thousands of years before the founding of [[Neverwinter]], Queen [[Morag]] and some of her followers built a [[magic]]al device known as the [[Source Stone]] to flee to another dimension as an ice age was devastating the world and their race was all but wiped out.",
            "The Founding": "The first settlement in the [[Savage Frontier]] was an [[elven]] city known as [[Illefarn]]. In time, Illefarn became a bustling nation after the time of the [[Crown Wars]], and lasted long enough to see the founding of the [[dwarf|dwarven]] nation of [[Delzoun]], the rise of [[Netheril]], the founding of the original [[Gauntlgrym]], and the harnessing of the [[primordial]] [[Maegera the Inferno]] beneath its lands. Eventually, Illefarn was divided into three nations, of which [[Iliyanbruen]] was the most prominent. Iliyanbruen frequently fought with the city of [[Illusk]], which was a legacy of the [[Netherese]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|-10}}, Lord [[Halueth Never]], a [[sun elf]] hero, led the elves of Iliyanbruen to victory over Illusk.<ref name=tGHotR-p59> In the site of his victory he commissioned the building of [[Castle Never]].\n\nWith the fall of Netheril, Iliyanbruen was weakened by the [[orc]] invasions known as the [[Orc Marches]], which paved the way for [[human]] settlers from [[Ruathym]] to spread to the North. One of the first settlements founded by them, in the [[87 DR|Year of the Hoar Frost, 87 DR]],<ref name=tGHotR-p61> was ''Eigersstor'', a small settlement built around Castle Never, that eventually grew in importance. Unknowingly to the founders, the city was built above the caves that housed the Source Stone.\n\nA century later, in the {{YearlinkName|187}}, the now large settlement was renamed Neverwinter, \n\nThe orc invasions became more dangerous over time, and Neverwinter was besieged at least twice, in the {{YearlinkName|306}}<ref name=tGHotR-p69> and in the {{YearlinkName|611}}.<ref name=tGHotR-p92> Luckily for the Neverwintians, they counted with the aid of the [[gold dragon]] [[Palarandusk]], who protected the city from the orc hordes and from raiders from the [[Moonshae Isles]]. This would not last, however, as, at some point before the [[940 DR|Year of the Cold Claws, 940 DR]], a group of [[adventurer]]s attacked Palarandusk's house in Neverwinter and forced the dragon to flee from the city.{{Cite dragon/252/Wyrms of the North: Palarandusk}}",
            "Orcgates Affair": "To put an end to the orc threat, a group of [[wizard]]s known as [[the Covenant]] founded the [[School of Wizardry]] in Neverwinter, in the {{YearlinkName|457}}.<ref name=tGHotR-p88> The wizards then rallied the human nations of the North against the orcs, and were able to stem the tide for a time. However, victory against the orcs that could have ended the threat for good was stolen from the human host when, in the {{YearlinkName|955}},<ref name=tGHotR-p113> the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] transported the orc horde to lands farther south. \n\nThat event, known as the [[Orcgates Affair]], triggered a long feud between the Covenant and Thay that erupted in Neverwinter over a century later. in the {{YearlinkName|1081}}, starting a wizardwar of titanic proportions.<ref name=tGHotR-p118> For the next twenty years, the Red Wizards and members of the Covenant battled each other throughout the North and Thay. The conflict ended when the leaders of the Covenant either left [[Faerûn]] or went underground.\n\nThe loss of the Covenant proved deadly when the largest orc horde in history swept down from northern lands to attack settlements as far south as [[Waterdeep]]. After a long and gruesome campaign, humanity eventually won the war in the {{YearlinkName|1301}},<ref name=tGHotR-p132> when the allied armies of Waterdeep, Neverwinter and [[Port Llast]] retook the city of [[Luskan]], that was in power of the orcs, crushing the horde at last. But the North had paid a heavy toll and recovery was slow.\n\nWithout the orc horde threatening its existence, Neverwinter became a center of civilization, peace and culture and was widely viewed as a marvel by visitors."

        "Modern History": {
            "Alagondar Dynasty": "Around the {{YearlinkName|1329}}, the popular adventurer [[Nasher Alagondar]] became ruler of the city of Neverwinter. His rule brought prosperity to the city, and he was much beloved. \n\nThe city weathered a riot known as the [[Five Fires Rising]] during the 1350s DR, and as of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, criminals and monsters had become prevalent enough in the city's older and innermost districts that many residents were moving to the outskirts. This led to an effort to revitalize the old city by converting some buildings to indoor gardens. In autumn of that same year, the whole city went on lockdown after ambassadors of the [[Lords' Alliance]] vanished. Their disappearance would be revealed to have been caused by the [[Kraken Society]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, a disease known as the [[Wailing Death]], that resisted even magical healing, killed much of the population of Neverwinter.<ref name=tGHotR-p153> The cure was eventually found but the casualties by that time were catastrophic. It was soon discovered that the Wailing Death was merely the precursor of war between Neverwinter and its longtime rival, the city of Luskan. Although it was the Queen Morag who sponsored the war, as part of her plot to return to [[Toril]], rather than the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]], the fighting (which ended in a stalemate, thanks to a plucky adventurer known only as the [[Hero of Neverwinter]]) soured the relationship between the two cities even more.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Lord Nasher was targeted in an assassination attempt by agents of the [[King of Shadows]]. This provoked an armed conflict against the King of Shadows known as the [[Shadow War]]. Lord Nasher suffered a wound during the battle at [[Highcliff]], prompting concern about what would happen to Neverwinter's rulership should he perish. Once the Shadow War was over, Neverwinter and [[Northwest Faerûn]]'s trade suffered greatly. Lord Alagondar extended a personal invitation to the [[Church of Waukeen]] to establish a temple in the City of Skilled Hands and aid in its financial recovery. The [[Temple of Waukeen (Neverwinter)|Temple of Waukeen]] was built at the site of Neverwintran mages' academy in the area of [[Tyr's Eye]] The school and several other building burned downed during a fire shortly after the Shadow War. Along with the temple, new [[Thayan enclave (Neverwinter)|Thayan enclave]] was established. During that time, access to the most of the city was restricted for non citizens. The Blacklake district was the only area open to guests but only through a pass purchase.\n\nThen, in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the [[Spellplague]] struck. Neverwinter was not hit as hard as other settlements in the [[Sword Coast]], and when Lord Nasher died, his son, [[Bann Alagondar]], founded the [[Alagondar]] royal family that ruled Neverwinter fair and well, allowing to city to prosper in the hard times after the Spellplague. Unknown to the citizens of Neverwinter, however, was the fact that a small [[plagueland]] was formed in the [[Underdark]] below the city.\n\nThe Alagondar line of kings and queens ruled their city fairly and well",
            "The Ruining": "{{see also|Ruining}}\n[[File:RuinedNeverwinter.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Neverwinter after the The Ruining, ''circa'' [[1451 DR]]]]\nIn the summer of 1451 DR, a small adventuring party rediscovered ancient Gauntlgrym beneath the nearby [[Mount Hotenow]], and as part of a Red Wizard plot, briefly awoke the primordial Maegera. In a fit of rage, the primordial released a burst of energy so powerful that it forced the eruption of the dormant volcano.\n\nThe resultant [[Cataclysm (Neverwinter)|cataclysm]]&mdash;a massive earthquake and combination of pyroclastic flow and lava&mdash;destroyed much of Neverwinter. A great rift known as the [[Chasm]] ripped apart the southeastern quarter of the city, and strange [[ash zombie]]s and [[plaguechanged]] horrors haunted the ruins, being released from the plagueland below Neverwinter. Thousands of citizens died during the cataclysm, including the Alagondar royal family, while many others fled to other cities, leaving only a desperate few to carve out an ill existence among the ruins. \n\nThe remaining Neverwintians were determined to survive in spite of the tragedy, however, and put a brave resistance against the plaguechanged horrors. They eventually built [[The Wall (Neverwinter)|the Wall]], using debris and other materials, sacrificing the southeastern quadrant but securing the rest of the city. The [[Blacklake District]] endured the cataclysm almost unscathed, and for a time it became the center of the city. These survivors were led by [[Jelvus Grinch]], who came to be known by the title of \"First Citizen\".\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1463}}, Thayans and their [[Ashmadai]] allies attacked Neverwinter, hoping to cause enough deaths to fuel a [[Dread Ring]], but their plans were foiled with the help of adventurers and some Netherese agents. Due to the help given by the Netherese, the [[shadovar]] attempted a power grab in the city but were driven out when Herzgo Alegni was defeated in combat by [[Artemis Entreri]] and Dahlia Sin'felle, which inspired the citizens to revolt against Herzgo's Netherese 'Shadow Guard' and to evict the Netherese from their city.\n\nIn the late 1470s DR, a contingent of orcs from [[Many-Arrows]] led by [[Vansi Bloodscar]] invaded the [[River District (Neverwinter)|River District]]. Although her orders were to explore the ruined city and report back, Vansi defied [[Obould XVII]]'s orders, seeing an opportunity to take power in Neverwinter as part of a future plan to annex the city to Many-Arrows. Her forces eventually were able to subjugate the entire district.",
            "New Neverwinter Movement": "{{see also|New Neverwinter}}\n[[File:Neverwinter cityscape.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''A rebuilt Neverwinter, ''circa'' 1479 DR.'']]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1468}},{{NeveremberInNeverwinter}} [[Open Lord]] [[Dagult Neverember]] of Waterdeep, seeing an opportunity to add to his financial empire, proclaimed to be a descendant of Neverwinter's former rulers and thus the rightful \"Lord Protector\" of the city, starting the [[New Neverwinter]] movement. Lord Neverember invested a great deal of his own personal fortune to hire workers to help to rebuild the city's infrastructure, and [[Mintarn]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] to protect it from monsters and bandits; he also began a strong campaign to buy the interest of merchants to send their caravans again to Neverwinter, and even ensured Neverwintian survivors had enough food and gold in hand. Unable to deal with the orc forces from Many-Arrows, Lord Neverember signed a peace treaty with them, declaring [[The Fallen Tower]] neutral grounds and the River District off-limits to his forces.\n\nAt some point, Lord Neverember banned the [[High Sun Games]] that were being held in the city, which he considered overly brutal.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}<ref group=\"note\">The date of Neverember's banning of the High Sun Games is unknown; it was when [[Edgin Darvis]] was young.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1474}}, the [[Sons of Alagondar]] emerged as an insurgent group that opposed the rule of Lord Neverember.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, the [[Harpers]] cell in Neverwinter suffered a devastating blow. One of their high-ranking members, [[Cymril]], was helping the Sons of Alagondar to oppose the rule of Lord Neverember. However, an ambush by Mintarn mercenaries resulted in her death, and in the revelation that she was also working for Neverember. After her treachery was revealed, the reputation of the ''Harpers of Neverwinter'' was greatly damaged in the region, at least for a time, and this led to a schism in the Sons of Alagondar into the more conservative [[Graycloaks]] and the more violent [[Nashers]].\n\nA cell of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] was also on the move, investing their efforts to thwart the New Neverwinter movement or to use it to advance their own agenda. Using the Chasm, the [[aboleth]]s kidnapped many inhabitants of Neverwinter and nearby settlements for their ambitious experiments to improve the dreaded [[Symphony of Madness]].\n\nLikewise, merchants from the \"new\" continent of [[Laerakond]] began to trade with the Faerûrian cities of the Sword Coast. In Neverwinter, a [[Tarmalune Trade House|group of traders]] from [[Tarmalune]], one of the [[Windrise Ports]] of Laerakond, approached Lord Neverember in hopes to establish permanent trade routes between the two continents.\n\nDespaired while seeing the evil forces surrounding Neverwinter, the [[god]]dess [[Selûne]] sent three [[Shards of Selûne|shards]] to the city to warn her priesthood. Lady [[Jasmine (priest)|Jasmine]], the head [[priest]]ess, recognized the portents and asked a group of adventurers for help. The adventurers were able to retrieve the gems, exposing the evil forces in the city and recovering the [[Shard of Night]] in the process.{{Cite dungeon/193/Shards of Selûne|21-42}}\n\nTaking advantage of the chaos, Valindra Shadowmantle and her forces launched an all-out attack on Neverwinter while soldiers and workers were on the fields outside the city as part of the rebuilding efforts. Valindra's actions sparked the [[siege of Neverwinter]]. Several adventurers were thrust into battle as well—while trying to reach the relative safety of Neverwinter's walls, their ship was sunk by a [[dracolich]] controlled by Valindra and the survivors joined forces with the defenders. Adventurers and heroes were able to defeat Valindra's undead minions and force her to retreat. Afterward, to celebrate Neverwinter's successes, Lord Neverember declared the Protector's Jubilee. The event drew merchants from up and down the Sword Coast and even [[Elminster]] himself came to see the city's renewal for himself. A guest of honor at the Protector's Enclave, Elminster bade adventurers who sought him out to escort merchants through the hostile territory of Blacklake, Ebon Downs, and Whispering Caverns and perform other quests on his behalf.\n\nWhen presumed heir of the Alagondar royal family showed up and helped the defenders of the city to deal with an attack of plaguechanged creatures in the [[Protector's Enclave]], it caused caused civil unrest. The Sons of Alagondar and those who opposed Neverember's rule wanted the Lord Protector to dismiss his claim to the rulership of Neverwinter in favor of the self-proclaimed heir. Lord Neverember hired a group of adventurers to track down the so-called heir and discover his true intentions. The investigation uncovered a plot devised by [[Seldra Tylmarande]] to unseat Lord Neverember. The adventurers were able to foil the plot and dealt with Seldra and the ''[[Crown of Neverwinter#False Crown|Crown of Neverwinter]]'' as they saw fit.\n\nWhen [[Mordai Vell]], an influential noble and a high ranking member of the Ashmadai, began to extort the wizard [[Elden Vargas]], Elden started to kidnap people from Neverwinter in order to conduct experiments on them to find a cure for his wife, [[Karis]], who had lost her sanity and was interned in [[Helm's Hold]] years before. At the same time, Elden tried to frame Mordai's Ashmadai for the kidnappings. When the Ashmadai identified him, they sent a team to kill him, but Elden was unexpectedly saved by an adventuring party that was investigating the kidnapping incidents. Elden eventually found a potential cure for his wife and invaded Helm's Hold with his mind-thrall minions, including the [[green dragon]] [[Chartilifax]], to rescue her. Elden performed a ritual on top of [[Helm's Cathedral]] in order to cure Karis, but he was tracked down and defeated by the adventurers. For their services, the adventurers were publicly declared the \"heroes of Neverwinter.\"",
            "Rebirth": "Around the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, Neverember's efforts to rebuild the city began to bear fruit, although reconstruction would continue for at least another decade.{{AI-time}} He ordered the use of magical means to seal the Chasm, although at a huge expense to the city's coffers that other parts of the city were neglected for years.\n\nNeverember was expelled from his position as [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, and turned his full attention to Neverwinter. During this time, he also imposed a steep \"devastation tax\" on essential goods like [[food]] and [[alcohol]]. By the {{YearlinkName|1496}}, he had begun levying hefty taxes specifically against wealthy merchants and adventuring companies in order to fund further rebuilding efforts.\n\nAt some point, Neverember was taken ill through the machinations of the conman [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] with the backing of [[Sofina]], a Red Wizard. Forge then assumed the role of Lord of Neverwinter, revived the High Sun Games, and made every effort to enrich himself while plotting the deaths of many of the city's inhabitants. He ruled for only about one year before his nefarious intentions and his alliance with the Red Wizards were revealed, at which point Neverember was restored as ruler of the city.{{HAT-time}}"
