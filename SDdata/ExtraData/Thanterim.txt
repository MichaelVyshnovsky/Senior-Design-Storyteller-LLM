The '''''Thanterim''''' family were an [[Urmlaspyr|Urmlaspyran]] merchant family that were closely aligned with the Church of [[Tymora]]. The Thanterims were quite successful, owning deeds, shares and loans in companies. However this all ended when [[Urmlaspyr]] rebelled against the [[Shadovar]] in 1409 DR for banning all religions except [[Shar]]. Amidst the fighting the family fled to [[Suzail]].

By 1479 their fortunes had dwindled to nothing with the only member of the family still alive being [[Deskyr Thanterim]]. His father, [[Hersir Thanterim]] had died only recently, leaving his son with a massive debt. At this time [[Deskyr Thanteirm]] does have the key to his family's ancestral vaults, but he lacks the funds to mount such a dangerous expedition to recover the family's fortunes.<ref>{{Cite book

==Family Estate==
The Estate was located in [[Urmlaspyr]]. It contained a family crypt with the entrance to the family vaults located nearby. Near the crypt was also a shrine to [[Tymora]] which included a statue of the goddess.<ref>{{Cite book

The passageways leading to the vault included a variety of traps and guardians. These protective measures included pit traps, magical crossbow turrets along with such homonculi as clay scouts and iron cobras. However the vaults also included statues of previous Thanterim lords and ladies, garbed in expensive clothing. Many of these were destroyed during the rebellions and by 1479 DR only a handful of the traps and guardians remained in working order.<ref>{{Cite book

Once inside the vault itself there were no traps or guardians. Twenty feet by twenty feet, the vault contained a variety of items in 1479 DR including crates with packing straw containing porcelain tableware, porcelain vases and silver chandeliers. In addition there are paintings of rich merchants with the occasional adventurer while high quality tapestries mostly depicted hunting and naval scenes. Furthermore the vault included a beautifully decoated suit of magical armour that secretly bore the holy symbol of Tymora, skillfully hidden amidst the decorations of the armour. Finally the vault included a spellbook, beautifully decorated religious scriptures to Tymora, a detailed map of a Tymoran church with the text written in code to obscure the location of the church as well as the various deeds, shares and loans the Thanterim family owned in numerous companies.<ref>{{Cite book

In 1479 the ruins of the Thanterim mansion are haunted by skeletons and undead spirits.<ref>{{Cite book
