Because of the [[Calishite naming conventions#Titles|Calishite convention]] of placing one's least important title first in his list of titles and the use of the ''[[annuv]]'', to most outsiders, it would be hard to know the true power or class of a pasha from his<ref group=\"note\">While not stated explicitly, it is strongly implied on p. 60 of ''[[Empires of the Shining Sea]]'' that a female pasha would violate Calimshan's rigid patriarchal society. This is confirmed by the use of only masculine pronouns throughout the \"Titles and Sovereignty\" section beginning on p. 63. Note, however, that there were two [[Alzhedo dictionary#Q|qysaras]] (empresses) in the [[Shoon Imperium]]. name alone, unless all of his titles were listed.\n\nFor example, the [[Alzhedo dictionary#C|caleph]] of Calimshan, its king, was referred to as pasha, since he was indeed the guildmaster of all guildmasters of [[Calimport]] and all Calimshan. To avoid insult, most Calishites would use the term \"[[syl-pasha]]\" (chief of pashas), but outsiders to Calimshan often did not know any better.\n\nBecause pashas controlled the businesses and the flow of money through Calimshan, they wielded a great deal of control over the country, even beyond the official rulers.\n\nPashas were often rich enough to maintain their own small armies of mercenaries to enforce their desires. It was also not rare for them to have connections to the underworld or even run criminal organizations themselves.\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], it was estimated that there were more than 5,000 pashas in Calimshan.\n\nAs of [[1492 DR]], a Calishite gang based in [[Little Calimshan]] in [[Baldur's Gate]] called themselves the [[Right Pashas]]. They saw [[the Guild]] as an outsider group, and fought to force the Guild out of what they saw as their territory.",

            "Background": "\"[[Wikipedia:Pasha|Pasha]]\" was a Turkish title used in the Ottoman Empire, and from there spreading to the Arabic language and to Egypt. It was used for generals, governors, and dignitaries, and meant roughly \"sir\".\n\nThe character of Pasha [[Abon Duum]] was originally called \"Baron\" in the [[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (comic series)|''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons'']] comics series, suggesting this is an equivalent title. Alternatively, one could argue that Pasha Abon Duum was both a pasha and a [[Alzhedo dictionary#M|''massatyr'']], the Alzhedo term for \"baron\", a lesser Calishite noble, as pashas very often had multiple titles.",
