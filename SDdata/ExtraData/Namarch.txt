The '''Namarch''' was one of the seats on the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]], and later the [[Council of Five (Amn)|Council of Five]], the ruling bodies that governed the nation of [[Amn]] during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. By [[1479 DR]], the noble [[Alibakkar]] family of [[Athkatla]] held control over the rank of Namarch within the council.

==Responsibilities==
The Namarch was responsible for overseeing the imports of Amn, with a particular focus on the goods brought in from foreign lands such as those from the nation's holdings in [[Maztica]]. They determined what kingdoms, city-states and independent nation-states could enjoy favored trading conditions, and thus lower tariffs, when dealing with Amn. Along with the [[Pommarch]], they levied trade tariffs, domestic taxes, set trade lines and established currency exchange and interest rates within the ''Merchant's Domain''.

==Members==
* [[Erlranther Alibakkar]] ([[1333 DR]] – [[1345 DR]])
* [[Curkon Gheldieg]] (1345 DR – [[1362 DR]])
* [[Qar Jysstev]] (1362 DR - ?)
