The Namarch was one of the seats on the Council of Six, and later the Council of Five, the ruling bodies that governed the nation of Amn during the 14 and 15 centuries DR. By 1479 DR, the noble Alibakkar family of Athkatla held control over the rank of Namarch within the council.
The Namarch was responsible for overseeing the imports of Amn, with a particular focus on the goods brought in from foreign lands such as those from the nations holdings in Maztica. They determined what kingdoms, city-states and independent nation-states could enjoy favored trading conditions, and thus lower tariffs, when dealing with Amn. Along with the Pommarch, they levied trade tariffs, domestic taxes, set trade lines and established currency exchange and interest rates within the Merchants Domain.
