        "mainbody": "ile:WaterdeepFoodMerchant.png|thumb|''Magical ingredients are as important as mundane one.'']]\n'''Foodomancy''' was a [[school of magic]] that tapped into ''[[the Art]]'' found in everyday objects. In this school's case, it tapped into magics contained in various exotic food ingredients that, when brought together in a specific manner, resulted in [[enchanted]] wondrous dishes. A person who specialized in foodomancy was called a '''foodomancer'''.{{Cite polyhedron/133/The Gentle Art of Foodomancy|20}}\n\n{{quote|''This is the first of my written tomes which discloses my findings on the school of \"Foodomancy.\" Not a terribly sharp title, I suppose, but it will have to suffice until I think up something wittier.''|[[Jonathan Greenleaf]], a disciple of foodomancy}}",

            "Magic Recipes": "Some of the recipes shared by Jonathan Greenleaf in his book included ''[[dragonblood soup]]'', which required [[wineskin]]s-full of [[red dragon]]'s blood, dragonflesh, shredded heart of a dragon, and a bunch of more mundane ingredients. If the dish was made correctly, following its detailed cooking times, it made the eater protected from fire, their skin thickened and became as hard as that of a red dragon, and they received the ability to breathe fire. Presumably, similar effects could be achieved by using other dragon types, but the precise instructions were not yet developed at the time the book of Jonathan Greenleaf's was printed. Another dish described was ''[[basilisk and bread]]'', a \"sand witch,\" as the author described it, chopped with an [[enchanted]] blade that was made out of two [[basilisk]]'s eyes, [[Death Cheese]], and cooked on magical flames. If the recipe was followed precisely and the ingredients were authentic, the eater received the benefits of the ''[[stoneskin]]'' [[spell]] and gaze abilities of a basilisk. Failing at the recipe could earn the imbiber food poisoning. Similar dishes existed in the school of foodomancy."

        "Practitioners": "{{quote|''I'd hate to oversimplify, but the process can be described in three words: we eat it!''|Jonathan Greenleaf}}<br/>\nNot all who practiced foodomancy had to be experienced [[mage]]s as the preparation needed specific tools, incantations, and ingredients and could be performed by any skilled individual. Following the recipes was integral to the magic's successes. Despite that, cooks who had a knack for magic were more likely to succeed and master this school of magic.\n\nTypical individuals who could master this magic were mages, [[cleric]]s, [[thieves]], [[paladin]]s, [[ranger]]s, and [[bard]]s. Practice made perfect, so foodomancers who practiced often had a lower chance of failing the recipe. More experienced foodomancers learned to identify magic in potential cooking ingredients and identify the origin of an ingredient in front of them. The most talented and experienced foodomancers learned enough of the theories and got enough practice to create their own new magical dishes. With each failure, they quickly identified what part of the formula was flawed and knew how to fix that on the next attempt to create a new magic dish. Master foodomancers were exceedingly rare.",
        "History": "{{quote|''In any case, I wish you [[Tymora]]'s [[bless]]ing in creating these recipes (even more so in acquiring the actual ingredients!)''|Jonathan Greenleaf}}<br/>\nIt was believed that the person who re-discovered the foodomancy magic was Jonathan Greenleaf, a magic practitioner and an extraordinary chef of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] from the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]]. His works were compiled into at least one tome,{{Cite polyhedron/133/The Gentle Art of Foodomancy|21}}\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century DR, Lord [[Raventree]] of Waterdeep got his hands on Jonathan Greenleaf's handwritten [[leather]]-bound works. The noble read the book while sipping on [[Undermountain Alurlyath]]. After completing the work, Lord Raventree set out to find and hire Jonathan Greenleaf as one of his cooks."
