Even political tasks could be asked of one so touched.\nThe touched were never quite sure what their powers were, and sometimes learned those only in the moment, as a surprise realization that something they thought impossible became possible.\n* The ability to notice hostile magic working within \n* A single-use spell appearing in their mind, sometimes even beyond their own power\n* The maximization of a spells power, when cast in battle\n* Instant recovery of a spell, without memorization involved\n* The ability to hurl a spell by an act of pure will, with no components\n* Instant spell reflection of any three spells, though never dispel magic\n* dimension door thrice a day.\nAfter completion, though the powers vanished, they usually kept some minor magic, such as a light or feather fall spell useable at will, or a strong resistance to one school of magic. Those who missed the power overmuch could petition to become a Pursuivant Arcane, or even a weavespinner.\nCategoryTitles\nCategoryMagic\nCategoryYear of Miracles\ng8jn7bsq70a8rf9uytk7tgssabdph2e"
