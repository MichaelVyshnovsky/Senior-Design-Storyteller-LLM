        "Commission": "When [[Mystra]] liked a mage's character, she sometimes appeared to them in private as a blue radiance and offered them power in exchange for a service.",
        "Tasks": "The tasks of the Touched could be small indeed, such as casting spells of [[wild magic]] into a [[dead magic]] zone, or they could be more major, such as destroying an [[enchanted]] object at a particular, dangerous location. Even political tasks could be asked of one so touched.",
        "Powers": "The touched were never quite sure what their powers were, and sometimes learned those only in the moment, as a surprise realization that something they thought impossible became possible.\n* The ability to notice hostile magic working within {{SI|100|feet|long=yes}}\n* A single-use spell appearing in their mind, sometimes even beyond their own power;\n* The maximization of a spell's power, when cast in battle;\n* Instant recovery of a spell, without memorization involved;\n* The ability to hurl a spell by an act of pure will, with no components;\n* Instant spell reflection of any three spells, though never ''[[dispel magic]]'';\n* ''[[dimension door]]'' thrice a day.",
        "Completion": "After completion, though the powers vanished, they usually kept some minor magic, such as a ''[[light]]'' or ''[[feather fall]]'' spell useable at will, or a strong resistance to one school of magic. Those who missed the power overmuch could petition to become a [[Pursuivant Arcane]], or even a ''[[weavespinner]]''.",
