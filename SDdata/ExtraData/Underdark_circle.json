Druids who took up the cause of nature in such a region had an affinity for this circle and the suite of spells that came to them without cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).\nDruids who had recently chosen the Underdark circle gained abilities similar to spiders, such as spider climb and web. Underdark circle druids with more experience could cast gaseous form, stinking cloud, greater invisibility, and stone shape. Those that had a great wealth of experience and wisdom could cast both insect plague and cloudkill.\nCategoryDruid circles\n2331vjsas6or6710e6xqtathej3jehg"
