Druids who took up the cause of nature in such a region had an affinity for this circle and the suite of [[spell]]s that came to them without cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).",
        "Underdark circle spells": "Druids who had recently chosen the Underdark circle gained abilities similar to [[spider]]s, such as ''[[spider climb]]'' and ''[[web]]''. Underdark circle druids with more experience could cast ''[[gaseous form]]'', ''[[stinking cloud]]'', ''[[greater invisibility]]'', and ''[[stone shape]]''. Those that had a great wealth of experience and wisdom could cast both ''[[insect plague]]'' and ''[[cloudkill]]''.",
