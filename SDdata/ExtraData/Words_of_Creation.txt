The '''Words of Creation''' were fragments of the precursor of the [[Celestial language]]. This precursor language, A very few [[celestial]]s remembered even some of the Words of Creation, and even fewer mortals had access to so much as one or two.

{{Quote|Music is the fruit of the divine tree that vibrates with the Words of Creation. But the question I ask you is, can a bard go to the root of this tree? Can one tap into the source of that power? Ah, then what manner of music they would bring to this world!|Fletcher Danairia, master [[bard]].}}
==History==
[[Bard]]s claimed that the multiverse was spoken into existence and shaped by the words of the gods, which resounded throughout reality even eons later. By this interpretation, bardic music was an attempt to harness the echoes of the primordial Words of Creation and subtly weave them into magical powers.

==Words of Power==
No mortal mind could comprehend more than three or four of these Words of Creation in their true form. and even if they were capable of using them, they could not bear to speak or hear the Words.

==Dictionary==
Ironically for a language, it was difficult to communicate solely using the Words of Creation. Though it had an astonishing level of subtlety in its terminology for concepts like beauty, mercy, and kindness, there were no words for those such as betrayal, misery, and hate.

==Script==
The Words of Creation had no written form, and written transliterations lost not only all power but all meaning. 

==Usages==
===Creation===
When used in accordance to their original purpose, trained application of the Words of Creation had no adverse side-effects, even for mortal users. This greatly enhanced any process of creation, improving mundane attempts at craftsmanship and increasing the longevity of magical [[conjuration]]s.

===Exalted Empowerment===
[[Good]]-aligned magic was energized by the Words of Creation. Such spells with [[verbal component]]s were more potent, as was the creation of good-aligned magic items. This usage of the words was also relatively safe; so long as spellcasters stuck to very basic spells, they would not be drained, and their use in enhancing items was measured out over such a long period of time that the user was not at risk.

===Bards===
By weaving Words of Creation into a song, music could be created that surpassed all earthly melodies and echoed the grandeur of the heavens' music. Appropriately trained bards could, in an extremely draining usage of the words, enhance the potency of their bardic music. This made their music far more inspiring, compelling, and liberating than it otherwise would be.

===True Names===
Perhaps the most dangerous use of the Words of Creation was in conjunction with [[true name]]s. Every creature had a unique true name among the Words of Creation.
