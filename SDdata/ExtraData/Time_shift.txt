Time shift was a psionic devotion of the psychoportation discipline that allowed the psionicist to travel into the near future.
This power allowed the psionicist to travel up to three minutes into the future and observe events until time caught up with them. The psionicist entered a different reality where no one could detect him in any way. The psionicist could not interact with anything but could position himself wherever he wished, appearing to real time people that he vanished and reappeared several minutes later. The psionicist did not exist in the traditional sense while waiting for time to catch up to them, therefore they were not affected by anything that happened during that time.
* Vhondryl, a psionicist in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor
