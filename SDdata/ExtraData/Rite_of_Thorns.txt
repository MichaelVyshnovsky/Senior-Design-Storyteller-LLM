The Rite of Thorns was a rarely seen Silvanite ritual used to protect and seal away a specific area.
The ritual required a number of druids to enter into a trance for some time, until the final recitations are completed. Once it was complete, the "Great Vine" would come out of the ground and surround an area with thorns and brambles, shielding it from intruders and harm.
In at least one instance, the casting of the ritual required an idol of Silvanus in order to be completed.
By the , the Rite of Thorns was considered a rare practice that was banned across most druidic circles due to consensus that the ritual caused more harm than good.
The same year, First Druid Kagha had the druids of the Emerald Grove begin casting the Rite of Thorns, in order to shield the grove from goblin cultists.
