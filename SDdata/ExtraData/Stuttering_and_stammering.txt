A '''stutter''' or '''stammer''' was a speech impediment involving involuntary repetition of sounds, as well as pauses, the use of incorrect words, changes in volume, and excessive corrections.

==Causes==
While it could occur randomly or constantly in sufferers, inherent stuttering could become noticeable or exacerbated when under stress, such as in social situations, such as when speaking to large groups and in states of nervousness.

People normally without the impediment might stutter when surprised, shocked, or frightened<ref><ref>{{Cite dragon/78/Ecology of the Mind Flayer|67}}<ref><ref>{{Cite dungeon/155/Keep on the Shadowfell: Forgotten Realms Conversion|6}}<ref> or when nervous.<ref> Severe cold could also cause an effect similar to stuttering, via chattering teeth.

Stuttering and stammering could also be induced by the cursed ''[[philter of stammering and stuttering]]'' (though a jester [[bard]] might turn this to their advantage)<ref><ref> or as a potential side-effect in the user of a ''[[wand of wonder IV]]'', when it produced an effect similar to the ''philter''.<ref>

The magical condition called ''[[mindshadow madness]]'' had as its initial stage a brief period of stuttering or babbling nonsense words.<ref> Similarly, [[kobold]] [[wild mage]]s had a tendency to stutter, as well as suffer random spasms and seizures in addition to spontaneous displays of [[magic]].<ref>

==Effects==
By inhibiting speech, a stutter or stammer might disrupt diplomacy, the uttering of [[verbal component]]s to [[spell]]s, or the recitation of a magical [[scroll]]. Others might react poorly to the speaker, by thinking what they said was nonsense, or getting impatient with them.<ref> Overall, a stutterer might speak slowly and carefully in order to lessen the condition, whereas speaking quickly could make it worse. Hence, it could be difficult for them to get a word in with someone who talked too much.

==History==

The year [[314 DR]] was called the Year of the Stammering Apprentice.<ref name=tGHotR-p69>

In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, [[Giogioni Wyvernspur]] was shocked into a bout of stuttering when he discovered a [[red dragon]] devouring his [[horse]], [[Daisyeye (horse)|Daisyeye]]. The dragon in question, [[Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco]], suggested he try to relax. Shortly after, he stuttered again when King [[Azoun IV]] ordered him to do an impression of him. Vangerdahast attributed his response to shock.
