The '''Companions Codex''' is a series of novels by [[R.A. Salvatore]] featuring [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and the reborn [[Companions of the Hall]]. The series follows the [[Neverwinter Saga]] and ''[[The Companions]]''. ''The Companions'' sets up the rebirth of the Companions of the Hall and leads directly into the first book of the Companions Codex series and thus could be considered "book zero" of the series. This series is followed by the [[Homecoming]] trilogy.
