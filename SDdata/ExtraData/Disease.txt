A '''disease''' was a detrimental medical condition that was not an injury.

==Description==
[[File:Swamp Fever.png|thumb|right|250px|''Disease-bearing [[mosquito]]s.'']]
A disease could be transmitted in various ways: injury (e.g., a bite from an infected creature), ingestion (e.g., of contaminated substances or the flesh of an infected creature), inhalation (e.g., of an infected creature's breath or of spores), mere contact (e.g., with an infected creature, especially with an open wound), etc.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/The Trail of Tears: Plague Bearers}} Some were also caused by [[:Category:Parasites|parasites]]. Creatures exposed to a disease ran the risk of becoming infected{{Cite dragon/40/Believe it or not, Fantasy has reality|54}}), and in some cases, creatures might spread a disease to which they themselves were immune.{{Cite polyhedron/132/City Stories: Mother's Cupboard|14}}

Both ordinary disease as well as parasitic infections were generally more common in hotter and wetter climates, in places close to [[:Category:Marshes|marshes]] or [[:Category:Swamps|swamps]], and in filthy or crowded conditions.&mdash;as well as along heavily trafficked trade routes. When new or unknown diseases arose, most often this happened in rural or frontier settlements where the people encountered previously unknown afflictions while interacting with remote [[:Category:Insects|insects]], [[beast]]s, and [[:Category:Plants|plants]]. This was especially a concern in terrains which acted as breeding grounds for disease carriers (namely wetlands) as well as anywhere in proximity to ''[[portal]]s'' to the [[Lower Planes]] or areas in which [[necromancy]] had ever been used to spread plague (e.g., the [[Fields of Nun]] in [[Chondath]]).

There was a generally important distinction between diseases which were "[[:Category:Natural diseases|natural]]" and those which were "[[:Category:Supernatural diseases|supernatural]]" or otherwise [[magic]]al in origin. Natural diseases were acquired by mundane means, so even the most exotic of them could be treated (although perhaps not cured) with traditional or nonmagical care. Mundane fevers could usually be cured if treatment was provided in a timely manner, although the role of ordinary medicine in the case of many diseases or parasitic infections was simply to slow the course of the malady to allow for the body to recover naturally or to buy time until magical healing could be obtained. Meanwhile, supernatural diseases were generally incurable or untreatable with natural or normal medical efforts. Such magical diseases were often spread by magical creatures, such as [[lycanthrope]]s or [[mummies]].

==Diseases in Society==
People feared disease, especially if they lived in areas where people were concentrated together. A common practice was to drip three drops of blood or tears&mdash;in homage to her holy symbol of three droplets in a triangle pattern&mdash;into or onto something or someone that was diseased, such as the mouth of a sick person, a tainted well, or blighted crops. The [[Church of Talona]] had a tenuous relationship with most other folk of Faerûn: on one hand, they were blessed with an immunity to disease, which made them valued doctors and healers in times of sickness. On the other hand, they were known to spread sickness themselves, especially to those they felt had disrespected their goddess, and this made them generally feared and disliked. Open worship of Talona was even banned in some places, such as in [[Waterdeep]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

The most well-known diseases in Faerûn included the so-called [[Five Fevers]] and [[Three Plagues]].

===Prevention and Treatment===
[[File:Blacktongue Claims Another Victim - Warren Mahy.jpg|thumb|300px|''The corpse of a victim of [[blacktongue fever]] is burned.'']]When it came to practical means of preventing or treating diseases, most people in Faerûn had no real medical knowledge and therefore relied on past experience, either re-using methods that had helped themselves or close associates in the past or seeking the counsel of elders and the like. In general, folk had at least some shared understanding about how certain diseases were transmitted, In regions where there existed a risk of insect-borne diseases, folk made use of a variety of [[insect repellent]]s to prevent illness. The importance of caregiving was also widely accepted, especially in regards to keeping the ill covered (or at least out of direct sunlight), treating them gently, keeping them hydrated, and administering [[herb]]al medicines and [[potion]]s. Beyond this, however, there were many disagreements about treatment methods, which was the case for at least two main reasons: first, there was the aforementioned reliance on personal experience&mdash;which could differ between individuals or groups&mdash;and second, there was false information that was intentionally spread. While some falsehoods were spread by [[evil]] factions with the goal of causing strife&mdash;such as by followers of Talona&mdash;other times they were spread by otherwise benevolent factions or churches&mdash;such as the [[Guild of Apothecaries and Physicians]] of Waterdeep&mdash;in an effort to exert political influence or to secure more coin for healing services.

While magic was perhaps the most reliable way to treat mundane diseases&mdash;such as with the spells ''[[remove disease]]'', ''[[lesser restoration]]'', or ''[[greater restoration]]''&mdash;it was possible to treat even serious illnesses by nonmagical means, although such treatment took many days and could cost as much as 50 [[gp]] per day as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Folk often sought out such treatment not only if they feared that they could not afford magical services, but also if they did not have an affiliation with a [[deity]]. For milder ailments&mdash;such as headaches, upset stomach, or the [[common cold]]&mdash;nonmagical care was sometimes the only option because priestly spellcasters saw these as too trivial to treat.

Most medicines were nonmagical, even if they were called "potions" by common folk (mundane bottled medicines were more appropriately called "[[physic]]s"), and most of these were made from herbs. Almost all folk in Faerûn had some basic familiarity with at least a few herbal remedies passed down through family, and many folk kept herbs in their homes (both fresh and dried, for there was generally little medicinal difference). In addition, even very small settlements often had an herbalist with knowledge about herbal remedies, and larger settlements tended to have at least one [[apothecary]] and perhaps a [[hedge wizard]] or a local priest who could provide similar knowledge even if they could not provide magical aid. Some claimed that [[chives]] and [[leek]]s were useful for treating disease.

===Plagues===
[[File:Plague priest - CBoN.png|thumb|300px|''A priest collects victims of plague.'']]
Plagues on Toril could arise from natural, [[arcane]], or [[divine]] causes, and tended to occur during times of deprivation, such as following a war or famine. Diseases generally turned into widespread plagues only when a population had never encountered them before. While terrible plagues periodically ravaged Faerûn, such widespread disease was largely a problem of the past by the 14{{th}} century DR because most people were the descendants of survivors of plagues&mdash;and had inherited immunities from their ancestors&mdash;or had been exposed to various diseases since childhood and therefore developed immunities. Toril also had a long history of interspecies intermingling and crossbreeding, which boosted the population's resistance to disease.

Another reason why plagues were contained was that preventive measures were taken by [[priest]]hoods and rulers. This was done either through official enforcement, by secretly mixing medical substances into food and water, or collective action to contain outbreaks. People who were obviously afflicted with a terrible disease might also simply be killed as a precaution, at least in frontier regions. Along the [[Sword Coast]], ships raised a black flag to signal the presence of plague when coming into port so that they would be quarantined and clerics would be sent to aid the crew.{{Cite adventurers league/Chaos in the City of Splendors|13}}

The exception to the rule that plagues were no longer a problem was the goddess Talona. Whenever she felt that her power or faith was waning, she was prone to inflict a plague on the land
