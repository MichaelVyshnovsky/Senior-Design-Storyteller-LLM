The Second Age of Shou Lung was a period of ancient history in Kara-Tur in the 2 millennium before Dale Reckoning. It was a time of Shou legends and a time in which various states were unified into the precursors of Shou Lung.
The Second Age was determined by scholars to commence with the unification of warring states along the Ching Tung River, ruled by the mortal Chan Cheng from the Imperial City of Ten Mor Shou in Chuta Te.
