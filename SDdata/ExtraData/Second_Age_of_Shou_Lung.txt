The '''Second Age of Shou Lung''' was a period of ancient history in [[Kara-Tur]] in the 2{{nd}} millennium before [[Dale Reckoning]]. It was a time of [[Shou]] legends and a time in which various states were unified into the precursors of [[Shou Lung]].

The Second Age was determined by scholars to commence with the unification of warring states along the [[Ch'ing Tung River]], ruled by the mortal [[Chan Cheng]] from the Imperial City of [[Kuo Meilan|Ten Mor Shou]] in [[Chu'ta Te]].
