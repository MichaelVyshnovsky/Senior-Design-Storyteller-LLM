Severe cold could also cause an effect similar to stuttering, via chattering teeth.\nStuttering and stammering could also be induced by the cursed philter of stammering and stuttering (though a jester bard might turn this to their advantage) or as a potential side-effect in the user of a wand of wonder IV, when it produced an effect similar to the philter.\nThe magical condition called mindshadow madness had as its initial stage a brief period of stuttering or babbling nonsense words. Similarly, kobold wild mages had a tendency to stutter, as well as suffer random spasms and seizures in addition to spontaneous displays of magic.\nBy inhibiting speech, a stutter or stammer might disrupt diplomacy, the uttering of verbal components to spells, or the recitation of a magical scroll. Others might react poorly to the speaker, by thinking what they said was nonsense, or getting impatient with them. Overall, a stutterer might speak slowly and carefully in order to lessen the condition, whereas speaking quickly could make it worse. Hence, it could be difficult for them to get a word in with someone who talked too much.\nThe year 314 DR was called the Year of the Stammering Apprentice.\nIn the , Giogioni Wyvernspur was shocked into a bout of stuttering when he discovered a red dragon devouring his horse, Daisyeye. The dragon in question, Mistinarperadnacles Hai Draco, suggested he try to relax. Shortly after, he stuttered again when King Azoun IV ordered him to do an impression of him. Vangerdahast attributed his response to shock.\nThe following people had persistent stutters or stammers\n* Luckbringer Adam, a priest of Tymora in Ravens Bluff, had an occasional stutter.\n* Clacker, a pech turned into a hook horror with a recurring stutter\n* Delitar the Slow, a historian of Westgate named for his slow, stuttering speech\n* Khalid, a half-elf fighter and Harper who had a recurring strong stutter\n* Maddgoth, a mage and killer based in Maddgoths Castle in Undermountain, who had a strong stammer\n* Shulgi, a vampire thief operating in Unther with a stutter\n* Spernik, a Dragon Cultist who stammered when nervous\n* Yazilliclick, a wood sprite of the Moonshae Isles who stuttered and repeated words often.\n* Ellis Adarbrent, a noble and cartographer of Waterdeep, who stuttered when nervous\n* Zo Hillmover, a dwarf warrior of the Vast, stuttered when nervous\n* Brian Robbinton, a shepherd of the Vast, stuttered and spoke slowly\n* Tym Doeskin, a leatherworker of Ravens Bluff, who stammered and stuttered because of his shyness\n* Taspar Hatchhill, a wereraven who stuttered often, especially when agitated\n* Kalib bin Jabir a would-be tomb robber of Tajar, who stuttered in social situations\n* Ko La Ko, a wu jen or Shou Lung, who stuttered when speaking to large groups\n* Chanczlatha Luruin, a cleric of Lathander at the Bargewright Inn, who had a recurring stammer and\n* Marvin Morris, a.k.a.
