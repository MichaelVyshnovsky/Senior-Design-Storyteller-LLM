The scent of danger ritual was used by shairs to charge their gens sense of smell with supernatural ability.
A concoction of rare herbs costing 600 dinars was needed to complete scent-related rituals. This ritual took 16 hours to complete.
This ritual allowed the gen to literally smell the threat of approaching malicious intent so long as it was directed precisely at their shair. The gen was not able to determine the direction or nature of the danger, only that it was present in the general area.
It should be noted that this ability did nothing to warn of regular dangerous occurences such as falling trees, mudslides, etc.
