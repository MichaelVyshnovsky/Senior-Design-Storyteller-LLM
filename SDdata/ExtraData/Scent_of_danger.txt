The '''scent of danger''' ritual was used by [[sha'ir]]s to charge their [[gen]]'s sense of smell with supernatural ability.

==Preparation==
A concoction of rare [[herb]]s costing 600 [[dinar]]s was needed to complete scent-related rituals. This ritual took 16 hours to complete.

This ritual allowed the gen to literally smell the threat of approaching malicious intent so long as it was directed precisely at their sha'ir. The gen was not able to determine the direction or nature of the danger, only that it was present in the general area.

It should be noted that this ability did nothing to warn of regular dangerous occurences such as falling trees, mudslides, etc.
