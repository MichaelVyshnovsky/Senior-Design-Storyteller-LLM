'''Smashcastle''' was a card game for two players enjoyed in [[northwest Faer√ªn]] ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. It was a casual game used to pass the time while visiting, gossiping, or discussing business. At the [[High Flagon]] gambling hall and inn, just outside [[Waterdeep]], patrons sometimes played this game (and bet on the outcome) while waiting to join another game.{{Cite dragon/302/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The High Flagon|77}}

==Set-Up and Play==
Smashcastle was played with two [[High Dragon#Set-Up|High Dragon decks]] with identical backs. A type of solitaire<ref group="note">Typically games like [[Wikipedia:en:Klondike (solitaire)|Klondike or Patience]]. was chosen and then both players shuffled their cards and played a game of solitaire in synchronicity with the other player. That is, players drew, played, and discarded at the same time. The difference was that the discards went to the opposing player's discard pile.

==Reputation==
This game was often played by well-to-do Waterdhavian matrons with their servants or with friends that came to call. The younger generation tended to scoff at the slow nature of the game.
