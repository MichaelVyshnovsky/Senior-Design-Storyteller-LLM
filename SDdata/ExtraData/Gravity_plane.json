        "mainbody": "Gravity planes had two sides; that is, they attracted objects from both the bottom and the top. It was thus possible for someone to walk on the bottom of a spelljamming vessel \"upside-down\".\n\nSome vessels took advantage of these two sides in their craft designs, but most sentient creatures preferred to have only a single \"up\" and did not build inhabitable decks on the \"bottom\" side.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this \"single-side\" preference, was the fact that the force from a larger object's gravity plane would overcome and negate a smaller object's plane. Entering a planet's gravity well, for example, would cancel the effects of a spelljammer's gravity plane so that only the planet's gravity could be felt. Anyone walking on the bottom of a spelljammer when nearing a planet would thus plummet to the ground.\n\nThe same issue occurred when a smaller spelljammer entered the gravity plane of a larger vessel. Crew and cargo might find themselves hurled sideways or toward the ceiling if the larger ship's force of gravity took over.\n\nProper diplomatic etiquette—and the safest operating procedure—when approaching another vessel was for the smaller vessel to first align itself to the larger one, such that the gravity planes were parallel. This avoided any issues once the two ships were close enough for the larger one's gravity plane to take over. It was considered an insulting breach of conduct to align one's ship parallel but upside down.\n\nSimilarly, a ship docking on an asteroid city, such as the [[Rock of Bral]], would have to approach carefully to orient the ship parallel to the asteroid's gravity plane. Docks were typically built at the level of the gravity plane so that vessels could \"land\" and \"float\" upon the plane and dock while the helm remained unmanned.\n\nProjectile weapons were often fired from at the level of the gravity plane, because objects here could \"float\" upon the plane."
