'''Necrology''' was the in-depth field of study of [[undead]] creatures.

==Knowledge==
A necrologist could generally identify what type of undead a creature was, potentially even their weaknesses or natural defenses. They were also knowledgeable in the history of different undead, their dining habits, and where they were likely to lair. When describing substances from undead or their physiological processes, the word "necrological" would be used instead.<ref>

==Education==
The [[Chantry of St. Sammaster]], a temple run by the [[Cult of the Dragon]], had a library that contained many [[book]]s and [[scroll]]s on the topic of necrology.<ref>
