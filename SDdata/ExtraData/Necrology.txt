Necrology was the in-depth field of study of undead creatures.
A necrologist could generally identify what type of undead a creature was, potentially even their weaknesses or natural defenses. They were also knowledgeable in the history of different undead, their dining habits, and where they were likely to lair. When describing substances from undead or their physiological processes, the word "necrological" would be used instead.
The Chantry of St. Sammaster, a temple run by the Cult of the Dragon, had a library that contained many books and scrolls on the topic of necrology.
This field of study dated as far back as the Netherese Empire, where it was studied by the doomscribes of Jergal.
* Kazerabet, a powerful Zakharan necromancer of the philosopher variety that trained under Vermissa.
* Pizentios, a reclusive archetypal necromancer.
* Sammaster, a powerful mage who discovered the process of dracolichdom, was quite a skilled necrologist.
* Sarzec, a Zakharan necromancer of the undead master variety and former apprentice to Pizentios.
* Talib, a Zakharan necromancer of the deathslayer variety and former husband of Kazerabet.
* Vermissa, an ancient Zakharan lich.
