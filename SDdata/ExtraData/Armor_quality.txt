An '''armor quality''', sometimes called an '''armor special ability''', was the name of an [[enchantment]] that could be placed on a piece of [[armor]]. Pieces of armor enchanted in such a way usually made them more resistant to certain types of damage, enhanced the wearer's abilities, or allowed them to hide or creep easier.

==Enchantment==
In order to enchant an existing piece of equipment, a versed [[enchanter]] had to use a powerful spell during the process. However, not all pieces of armor could be enchanted. Some specific enchantments were limited to the type of material the armor was made from.

==List of Armor Qualities==
''For an extensive list, see [[:Category:Armor qualities]]''

===Any Armor===
* ''[[Negative energy protection (armor quality)|Negative energy protection]]'': made the wearer more resistant to attacks associated with energy from the [[Negative Material plane]].
* ''[[Nimbleness]]'': made the armor less restrictive, and reduced its weight.
* ''[[Proof against transmutation]]'': made it so the wearer's form could not be changed ([[polymorph]]ed or [[petrify|petrified]]).
* ''[[Magic eating]]'': gave the wearer a degree of resistance to [[magic]].

===Metal Armor===
* ''[[Blueshine]]'': gave the armor immunity to [[acid]] and rusting, and allowed the wearer to hide more efficiently.
* ''[[Everbright]]'': made the armor incredibly bright, as well as providing the wielder with resistance to acid.
