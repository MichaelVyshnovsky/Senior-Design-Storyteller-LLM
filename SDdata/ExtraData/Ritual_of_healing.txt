Ritual of healing was a type of restoration ritual that was taught by the College of Rune Magics.Disclaimer The Shattered Statue was written to be cross-compatible with the tabletop role-playing game DragonQuest and this ritual was detailed in a section of expanded magic rules for use with DragonQuest.
During the process of casting this ritual, those inside its warded area had the same protection as those within a ritual of warding with runesticks. Once completed this ritual would completely restore any loss of endurance and fatigue &mdash  as well cure any non&mdashmagical diseases, fevers, or infections &mdash of entities of the casters choice that are standing within the casting zone.
This ritual took a total of seven hours to complete. If anyone inside of the warded area exited during the ritual, its ward would be broken. At which point the ritual had to be started from scratch. Besides that, there was a small chance of the ritual backfiring and killing the entities within the warded area.
Casting this ritual first required warding an area with the ritual of warding with runesticks, setting it up in a roughly circular configuration around the entity to be healed, and doing so with a total of seven runesticks. Each of these runesticks had to be inscribed with the rune for warding and made from either If the runesticks were made of either elm or walnut wood, then the casting time of the ritual would be reduced by five hours.
