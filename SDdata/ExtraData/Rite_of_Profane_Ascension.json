As of {{Yearlink|1492}}, the only being to know the details of it was the [[archdevil]] [[Mephistopheles]], who, in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]], brokered an [[infernal contract]] with the [[vampire lord]] [[Cazador Szarr]]. Likewise, Cazador was the only vampire known by name to attempt performing the ritual."
