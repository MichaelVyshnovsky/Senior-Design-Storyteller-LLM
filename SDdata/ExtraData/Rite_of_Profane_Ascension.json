Once it had been carried out, the person leading it would become the Vampire Ascendant. In their new form, they would no longer be affected by the usual curses afflicting vampires, such as sensitivity to sunlight or running water. Additionally, all the powers previously lent to them by their vampire form would grow even more powerful.\nThe origins of the rite were lost in time. As of , the only being to know the details of it was the archdevil Mephistopheles, who, in the 13 century DR, brokered an infernal contract with the vampire lord Cazador Szarr. Likewise, Cazador was the only vampire known by name to attempt performing the ritual.\nVideo Games\nBaldurs Gate III\nCategoryMagic\nCategoryRituals\n0y90pibladna5mr4bhsaak9qkxi7wls"
