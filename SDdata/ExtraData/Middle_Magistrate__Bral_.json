This position tended to be a busier one than that of the High Magistrate of Bral. He or she controlled a small watch of 20 well-armed guards and several mages.\nWhenever a serious crime occurred in Middle City—most minor crime in Bral was either ignored or tolerated—one would report to the Middle Magistrate or a representative, who would then decide if an investigation and/or arrest were warranted. In general, the magistrates did not like to be bothered.\nThe Middle Magistrate was based out of a complex of buildings in the Middle City.\nDuring the reign of Prince Andru, toward the end of the 14 century DR, the Middle Magistrate was Lady Terissa Ketal, who was thought of as a \"jettisoning judge\" because of her tendency to sentence criminals to execution.\nCategoryTitles\n0w9rvq7xjx1mhhs4432x724lsay15kl"
