        "mainbody": "he history of Myth Drannor was long and tumultuous, fraught with rises to power and falls to ruin. It spans the timeline  of the original city of Cormanthor, along with that of Myth Drannor into the 15 century DR.\n The city of Cormanthor was founded by Coronal Kahvoerm Irithyl as the capital city of Cormanthyr, the empire that united the elven lands of Semberholme, Elven Court and Jhyrennstar. Coronal Kahvoerm summoned the Rule Tower with the elfblade known as the Rulers Blade, a ritual that was soon repeated with the Warblade and the Artblade, forming the three towers of Castle Cormanthor.\n The lovers referred to as the \"Guardian Paramours\" underwent the process to become the first baelnorns, dedicating their existence to the protect the city and its coronal.\n By this year the city enjoyed four thousand years of prosperity. It passed into its sixth rysar as Eltargrim Irithyl emerged as the newest Coronal. Due to the increasing threat of regular orc raids and the greater influence held by other races of Faerûn, Coronal Eltagrim declared that a mythal would be built around the city and allowed the first human visitor to set foot within. \n With the completion of the mythal,\n The five leading elven houses of Myth Drannor left the city and began to formally document the \"crimes\" of humanity. Among these were Starym, Bharaclaiev, Hyshaanth, Rhaevaern, and Tellynnan families.\n The rebellion was brought to the Court of Cormanthor by Lord Speaker Llombaerth Starym and many nobles lost their lives before the conflict was ended by the Coronal, the Srinshee and Elminster Aumar.\n Eight humans were murdered by poison, and the killings are attributed to a servant of House Ammath, who actually spied for for House Symbeam.\n Dwarves from Ammarindar and Citadel Felbarr relocated from their ancestral homes to Myth Drannor.\n Scores and scores of halflings traveled east from their homes in far to the west in Tethyr and Meiritin in order to relocate to the city. Several portals are established in order to better facilitate this migration.\n A record number of babies were born within the city during the year. The number of elven births that year was greater than those born in the entirety of the previous decade.\n Elves and non-elves engaged in their first cooperative dragon-hunt and slayed the white dragon Arkhenthus.\n The first groups of gnomes made their home in Myth Drannor.\n Over 500 humans and dwarves joined the ranks of the AkhVelahrn, which had never before had non-elves among its members.\n The Crown Against the Scepter Wars came to an end with a Cormanthyrian victory over the city-state Hlondath.\n The red dragon Garnetallisar was granted permission to live within the city, due to its unique benevolent nature.\n Seven powerful mages formed the first wizard school that was open to all races whose teachers were not exclusively elves, known as the Incanistaeum. These mages came to be known as the Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor outside the city.\n The citys mythal was assaulted by a contingent of five black dragons and two green dragons. They were ultimately destroyed by Itham, commander of the dragonriders, though at the cost of his life, that of a bronze dragon, along with fifty hippogriffs and their riders.\n The coronal placed moratorium on the creation of new homes and no more non-elves were permitted to make their residence in Myth Drannor.\n The Starym clan of elves returned from Eaerlann and Illefarn to reclaim their familys holdings and restore theirs honor. This was not the case unfortunately, as Illitran Starym formed a pact with Moander. \n The Guild of Naturalists formed their order and spent the next two years building the Halls of the Beast-Tamers.\n The surviving dwarves of Roldilar fled to Myth Drannor after their home was destroyed during the Battle of Deepfires.\n This was the year considered by many to be the apex of Myth Drannors cultural influence and power within the region. \n Content with the completion of his dream of \"unifying the tribes of this great land\", Eltargrim died and passed on to Arvandor. Eltargrims heir and the citys high mages declared a five-year mourning period.\n Eltargrims only heir, Aravae Irithyl was murdered by Illitran Starym, leaving no apparent ruler for the end of the mourning period.\n Following the end of the Mourning Days, it was declared the city would hold a Claiming Ceremony. The deaths of forty elves follow with no individual declared worthy to rule. The Srinshee took the Crownblade on her own accord and fled Myth Drannor, vowing only to return once the elves had remembered the lost dream of Cormanthyr.\n With no single person to serve as coronal, the Arms-Major and Spell-Major of Myth Drannor met with two mages of the High Court along with the spirits of the trees. Guided by the message \"if one star cannot guide you in your travel, look to them all for guidance\", they formed the Council of Twelve. \n Many dwarves left the city for the region of the Moonsea, settling in hills of Sarphil.\n The spellcasting group known as the Seven Wizards of Myth Drannor was disbanded. Many other talented mages, artists, and craftspeople left the city soon after. Those who came into the city only sought power derived from the citys mythal.\n After tunneling beneath the city, dwarves of Clan Tarynstone were exiled from Myth Drannor.\n As it became more apparent that a civil war would break out between the citys noble houses, many individuals joined the AkhVelahr. This highly-trained force served under the command of the council.\n Mages from the High Court formed the Eternal Srinnala, the group of spellcasters who dedicated themselves to the final wishes of Cormanthys last coronal and the Srinshee.\n As of this time, many guilds and establishments in the city segregated themselves from others by race or occupation. The citys priests united in defense of their own interests, over those of their fellow Myth Drannans.\n The Incanistaerum was disbanded by the last of the Seven Wizards.\n Darcassan, great diviner of Windsong Tower shared his visions about the fall of Myth Drannor with the elders, but was directed to inform no one else. Members of the Circle of Flames began to discreetly removed magic items and tomes out of the City of Song.\n By this year the noble members of the Council of Twelve had fallen to divisive in-fighting and dedicated themselves to the interests of their own houses over those of Myth Drannor. The empire of Cormanthyr had become a collection of city-state.\n300px|right|thumb|Ruins of Myth Drannor, by Jason A. Engle\n The long-imprisoned group of nycaloths known as the Trio Nefarious were released from an extra-dimensional prison high above the city. Aulmpiter, Gaulguth and Malimshaer escaped to the North where they began raise an army that came to be known as the Army of Darkness.\n Within 18 months they had amassed a great host of orcs, gnolls, trolls, goblins and other lesser fiends and monsters, some 3,000 strong.. \n Intent on seeking revenge against the elves that had imprisoned them, the nycaloths and their army entered the northern woods of Cormanthor, attacking some elven outposts and moving closer to the capital of Myth Drannor. These initial hostilities began what came to be known as the Weeping War. \n After three years of war, the city of Myth Drannor was finally overrun by the Army of Darkness. Despite fierce resistance from the elven defenders and the deaths of the three nycaloths, the demonic hordes were far too numerous to prevent the fall of the city. In an operation lasting almost a month, the city was set alight and pillaged, and the elves were almost all slain. \n About 200 survivors managed to escape the onslaught.\n The self-exiled elven leaders that left some five hundred years earlier formed the Eldreth Veluuthra, or the \"Victorious Blade of the People\".\nThe fall marked the beginning of the Retreat – the six-hundred year period when the elves of Faerûn gradually left the Realms for the fabled isle of Evermeet.\nFor over six centuries, the citys ruins were home to many lethal predators including alhoons, devils, dragons, the Cult of the Dark Naga and phaerimms. Parts of it were protected by baelnorns and it was frequented by adventuring parties and raiders looking for treasure and magic. The elves kept the place hidden and sealed for the most part, and the city became a legend, one of the most dangerous adventuring sites in all of Faerûn. It remained as such for many years, even through the Retreat when the elves abandoned Cormanthor and left the city to its own fate.\n The scrying stones of Myth Drannor were recovered by Princess Ilmara of Impiltur.\n Malkizid returned to Faerûn and takes leadership over the fiends infesting the city.\n Kaedthis, the leader of one of the cults of the moon, sought to recapture the city and take control of its mythal.\n The army of Seiveril Miritar, leading a return to Faerûn, recaptured Myth Drannor and its new Coronal, Ilsevele Miritar, began restoring the city to its former glory. As of 1479 DR, the city occupied a smaller area than it once did, and some parts of the ruins of the older city were still present, the forest having regrown to cover them. Myth Drannors mythal was repaired and was active in 1479 DR, preventing access to the city from other planes.\n After over 100 years of war against Netheril, the Netherese enclave of Thultanthar fell from the sky upon Myth Drannor, destroying both cities. Ilsevele and her surviving subjects fled to Semberholme."
