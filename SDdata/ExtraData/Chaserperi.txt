The '''Chaserperi''' was a family of mages fostered by the [[Magister]] [[Maxiladanarr Torstren]].{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|77-79}}

==Physical Characteristics==
Most Chaserperi were small, dark-haired and agile, restless, but efficient about their movements. The family in [[Amn]] had members growing somewhat broader, but none of them had become especially tall.

==History==
Prior to Maxiladanarr's Torstren fostering during his reign as the [[Magister]], which spanned from {{yearlink|1322}} to {{yearlink|1328}}, the Chaserperi were weavers and cloth sellers of southern [[Amn]]. By {{yearlink|1370}}, they had become "port rats" sellers of various things, spread across the [[Sword Coast]] and all lands north of the [[Calim Desert]].

As of 1370, the most recent generation had begun to pursue broader interests, moving their business inland. 

A few Chaserperi lived instead lives of quiet study, working as scriveners in [[Candlekeep]] and in several cities of the Sword Coast. There were also some members that were fineweavers or potters.

==Abilities==
All Chaserperi could smell the "tang" of magic, or rather, feel it somehow. Almost all of them knew some cantrips, and many of them knew more magic.

==Structure==
There were close to a hundred and seventy mages capable at least of launching a ''[[fireball]]'', and twenty to thirty quite worthy of the name of a wizard. There were maybe a hundred children in the clan ready to learn magic by {{yearlink|1370}}.

The clan's heads as of {{yearlink|1370}} were its patriarch and matriarch, [[Faereldan Chaserperi]] and [[Chancereene Chaserperi]]. The two of them lived in an unremarkable house in [[Athkatla]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Chaserperi took care to become regarded as honest merchants, given the danger for a "port rat" that was seen as dishonest. They also avoided raising their profile, leaving themselves known mostly for being "old, trusted money", and a family of able people, in the know.

The family shared surprisingly few tales of magic internally, which included the fabled exploits of [[Auldo Chaserperi]] and [[Melegor Chaserperi]].
