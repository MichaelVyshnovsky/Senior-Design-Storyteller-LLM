'''''Dimension walk''''' was a [[psionic]] devotion of the [[psychoportation]] [[discipline]] that allowed the [[psionicist]] to travel through a portal to another dimension.

==Effects==
The portal opened with this power pierced other dimensions at right angles, making it better than the ''[[dimensional door]]'' power in several ways. Perhaps the most important was that traveling by ''dimension walk'' was not disorienting in any way. Secondly, the range of ''dimension walking'' was much greater, allowing the psionicist to travel up to {{SI|21|mi|k|long=yes}} every ten minutes. The one drawback, aside from the travel not being instantaneous, was that only the psionicist was able to travel by this method since the portal closed right behind him, leaving any companions stranded.

Intense concentration was required on the psionicist's part while navigating the murky gray of the dimension. Slight distractions could mean that they would find themselves several miles off target when exiting the dimension at their destination.

Though the psionicist could bring their equipment with them, any [[magic item]]s that held their own dimensions, such as a ''[[bag of holding]]'', would spill their contents once they were within the dimension.
