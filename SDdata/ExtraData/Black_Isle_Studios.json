        "mainbody": "lack Isle Studios was a division of the PC and video game developer and publisher Interplay Entertainment, created specifically for the development of PC role-playing games. The division was formed during 1996, adopting the name \"Black Isle Studios\" during 1998. The idea for the divisions name came from the Black Isle in Scotland - founder Feargus Urquharts native country. Black Isle Studios was most famous for working on the Fallout, Icewind Dale and Baldurs Gate series of PC role-playing games, though it only published the Baldurs Gate series.\nIn 1998, several key members responsible for the divisions first title, Fallout, left Interplay to form Troika Games. On December 8, 2003, in the midst of serious financial difficulties, Interplay laid off the entire Black Isle Studios staff., filing bankruptcy on June 2, 2004. By then, most members had moved on to found Obsidian Entertainment.\nUntil last, Black Isle Studios worked on new innovative games, such as Fallout 3 (Codename Van Buren) and Black Isles Torn.\n*Fallout (1997)\n*Fallout 2 (1998)\n*Planescape Torment (1999)\n*Icewind Dale (2000)\n*Icewind Dale Heart of Winter (2001)\n*Icewind Dale Heart of Winter - Trials of the Luremaster (2001)\n*Icewind Dale II (2002)\n*Baldurs Gate Dark Alliance II (2004)\nAmong the products whose development Black Isle assisted are\n*Baldurs Gate (1998)\n*Baldurs Gate Tales of the Sword Coast (1999)\n*Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn (2000)\n*Baldurs Gate II Throne of Bhaal (2001)\n*Lionheart Legacy of the Crusader (2003)\nTwo compilations bearing their name were also released\n*Black Isle Compilation (2002)\n*Black Isle Compilation Part Two (2004)\n*[http//www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/fallout3/news_6085243.html GameSpot \"Interplay shuts down Black Isle Studios\" (8 December 2003)]\n*[http//www.mobygames.com/company/black-isle-studios Black Isle Studios] profile on MobyGames\ndeBlack Isle Studios\nenBlack Isle Studios\nCategoryVideo game developers\ns64znvvjuykpoqqiubpa6sdm64uha7s"
