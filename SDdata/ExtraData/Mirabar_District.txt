The Mirabar District (also known as the Mirabar Shield) was a district on the north bank of the city of Luskan, and was dedicated to the warehouses used by Mirabarran merchants operating in the city. As of 1370 DR, companies such as Anvilfist Banner, the Golden Hand, and Thalorins Manymetals traded in this district. These companies operated up to 90 guards to prevent "accidental" injuries from the Luskan militia, who were known to fire into the district for "blood money".
