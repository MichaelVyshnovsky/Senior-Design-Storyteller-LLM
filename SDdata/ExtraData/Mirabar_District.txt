The '''Mirabar District''' (also known as the '''Mirabar Shield''') was a district on the north bank of the city of [[Luskan]], and was dedicated to the warehouses used by Mirabarran merchants operating in the city. As of [[1370 DR]], companies such as [[Anvilfist Banner]], the [[Golden Hand]], and [[Thalorin's Manymetals]] traded in this district. These companies operated up to 90 guards to prevent "accidental" injuries from the Luskan militia, who were known to fire into the district for "blood money".
