        "mainbody": "Gauntlet was a local title used in the Delimbiyr Vale by the midâ€“14 century DR. It was comparable to a baron or lord and different communities used it in different ways.\nThe village of Shining Falls was ruled by a gauntlet.\nThe city of Loudwater, meanwhile, had two gauntlets the Gauntlet of the Western Marches and the Gauntlet of the Eastern Marches. They were senior warriors responsible for the defense of the city from their respective halves of Loudwaters lands. In times of war, they might be joined by a third gauntlet. The gauntlets directly reported to the reigning High Lord of Loudwater. Circa 1372 DR, the two gauntlets were Harazos Thelbrimm, Gauntlet of the Western Marches, and Jaida Zerezeal, Gauntlet of the Eastern Marches."
