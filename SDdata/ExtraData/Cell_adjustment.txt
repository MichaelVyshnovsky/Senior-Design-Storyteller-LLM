Cell adjustment was a restorative psionic power of the psychometabolism discipline.
If successful, those touched by the user would have their wounds healed and any non-magical diseases cured, though it could only do one or the other. In addition, unnatural diseases such as mummy rot and lycanthropy would not be cured.
