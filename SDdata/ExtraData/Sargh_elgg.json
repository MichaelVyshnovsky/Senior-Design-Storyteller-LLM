        "Description": "The style was very simple but required extensive training to become a master.\n\nIt focused on striking with a light weapon, for example the [[rapier]], and maximizing a drow's effectiveness with it.",
        "Training": "The style exploited the natural dexterity of a [[drow]] by learning to use a light weapon with finesse,",
        "Reputation": "\"Valor in slaying\" was a name given to bolster the confidence of the user, who otherwise had to make do with poor training.\n\nWhile drow society was famous for the intrigue and strife among its high society, the common majority's life was marked first and foremost by poverty, oppression, desperation, and accompanying lack of education and training opportunities, making this style the only choice for most common and low-ranked guards and soldiers.\n\nNevertheless, [[cleric]]s of [[Kiaransalee]], [[Lolth]], and [[Vhaeraun]] also used this style because these deities all used light weapons as their favored weapon, and Lolth and the short sword for Vhaeraun. [[Wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s of martial inclination also practiced the basics of the style.",
        "Appendix": {
            "Background": "This style is based on the Improved Critical, Weapon Finesse, and Weapon Focus feats of 3rd-edition ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''; the latter was generally given to drow warrior NPCs, such as in ''[[Monster Manual 3.5]]''.",
