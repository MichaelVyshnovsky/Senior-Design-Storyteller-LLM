The '''Pommarch''' was one of the seats on the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]], and later the lowest-ranking member of the [[Council of Five (Amn)|Council of Five]], the governing bodies of [[Amn]] throughout the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. By [[1492 DR]], the [[Cyricist]] [[Nashivaar]] family of [[Esmeltaran]] maintained the seat of Pommarch within the council.

==Responsibilities==
The Pommarch was responsible for managing Amn's vast amount of exported goods, perhaps the most time-consuming responsibility held by any members of the council. They fashioned trade agreements with other nations and maintained the safety of Amn's trade routes. Along with the [[Namarch]], the Pommarch established trade tariffs and set tax and exchange rates throughout the country.

==Members==
* [[Phaan Colwyvv]] ([[1333 DR]] - [[1345 DR]])
* [[Wulver Xornnag]] (1345 DR - [[1362 DR]])
* [[Tyrda Q'Helvor]] (1362 DR - ?)
