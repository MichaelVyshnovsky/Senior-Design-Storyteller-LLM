The Pommarch was one of the seats on the Council of Six, and later the lowest-ranking member of the Council of Five, the governing bodies of Amn throughout the 14 and 15 centuries DR. By 1492 DR, the Cyricist Nashivaar family of Esmeltaran maintained the seat of Pommarch within the council.
The Pommarch was responsible for managing Amns vast amount of exported goods, perhaps the most time-consuming responsibility held by any members of the council. They fashioned trade agreements with other nations and maintained the safety of Amns trade routes. Along with the Namarch, the Pommarch established trade tariffs and set tax and exchange rates throughout the country.
