        "mainbody": "he Endless Chant was a recitation that was continually repeated by a select few monks of the Avowed. It echoed through the courtyard of Candlekeep throughout all hours of the day. It covered all of the prophecies of the famous seer Alaundo, who inscribed his visions in the keep during the 1 century DR.\nIt was performed in a resounding yet monotone voice,\nThe chant was not truly \"endless\". As time went on, more and more of the prophecies came true and were removed from the monks recitation.\nSome excerpts from the Endless Chant circa 1367 DR included\n* \"A golden unicorn will travel unmolested through the length of Waterdeep.\"\n* \"White birds shall vanish from the North, and great evil shall die and be reborn.\"\n* \"The Wyrm shall wander the earth and such a pestilence will follow in his wake that all that know of his passing shall be struck down by the plague.\"This may relate to the dragon-spread Plague of Dragons in the Year of the Wandering Wyrm, 1317 DR.\n* \"When conflict sweeps across the Dales, the great lizards of the north shall descend with fire and fury.\"\n* \"When shadows descend upon the lands, our divine lords will walk alongside us as equals.\"\n* \"The Lord of Murder shall perish, but in his doom he will spawn a score of mortal progeny. Chaos will be sewn from their passage.\"In Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn, this line was changed to \"The Lord of Murder shall perish, but in his death he shall spawn a score of mortal progeny. Chaos shall be sown in from their footsteps.\n* \"In the Year of the Turret, a great host will come from the east like a plague of locusts.\""
