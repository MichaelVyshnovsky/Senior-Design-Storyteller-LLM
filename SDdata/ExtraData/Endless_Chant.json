        "mainbody": "'''Endless Chant''' was a recitation that was continually repeated by a select few [[monk]]s of the [[Avowed]]. It echoed through the courtyard of [[Candlekeep]] throughout all hours of the day. It covered all of the prophecies of the famous [[:category:seers|seer]] [[Alaundo]], who inscribed his visions in the keep during the 1{{st}} century [[DR]].",
        "Performance": "It was performed in a resounding yet monotone voice,\n\nThe chant was not truly \"endless\". As time went on, more and more of the prophecies came true and were removed from the monks' recitation.",
        "Excerpts": "Some excerpts from the Endless Chant ''circa'' [[1367 DR]] included:\n* \"A golden [[unicorn]] will travel unmolested through the length of [[Waterdeep]].\"\n* \"White birds shall vanish from the North, and great evil shall die and be reborn.\"\n* \"The Wyrm shall wander the earth and such a pestilence will follow in his wake that all that know of his passing shall be struck down by the plague.\"This may relate to the dragon-spread [[Plague of Dragons]] in the [[1317 DR|Year of the Wandering Wyrm, 1317 DR]].\n* \"When [[Second inter-dale war|conflict]] sweeps across [[Dalelands|the Dales]], the [[dragon|great lizards]] of the north shall [[1356 DR|descend with fire and fury]].\"\n* \"When [[1358 DR|shadows descend upon the lands]], our [[Faer√ªnian pantheon|divine lords]] will [[Time of Troubles|walk alongside us as equals]].\"\n* \"The [[Bhaal|Lord of Murder]] shall perish, but in his doom he will spawn a score of [[Bhaalspawn|mortal progeny]]. Chaos will be sewn from their passage.\"In ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn]]'', this line was changed to ''\"The Lord of Murder shall perish, but in his death he shall spawn a score of mortal progeny. Chaos shall be sown in from their footsteps.''\n* \"In the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret]], a [[Grand Army of the Tuigan|great host]] will come from [[Hordelands|the east]] like a plague of locusts.\""
