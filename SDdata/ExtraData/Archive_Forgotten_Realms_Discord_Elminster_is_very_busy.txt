| query      = I feel like 99% of the time, Elminster probably would understand he doesn't actually need to interfere. Heroes are remarkably capable; even in their most dire moments, he'd probably have the wisdom to recognize that 'this too shall pass'.
| questioner = kryptius
| answer     = Indeed. He's so busy he barely has time for what he deems crucial, and most matters of violence that adventurers can handle aren't "crucial" in his view. He's busy serving Mystra by spreading magic, curbing (hopefully WITHOUT fighting or destroying) those who use magic to oppress others, and putting out the sort of fires that might doom the world, or rile gods, or make magic wild and unstable across an entire continent. I crafted him as an unreliable narrator mouthpiece for the Realms, and TSR kept trying to turn him into an iconic action hero. And he HATES capes and spandex.
