Bronze golems were humanoid shaped constructs constructed out of bronze that were similar to iron golems in some respects.
On average these golems stood .
These golems could only be harmed by weapons with a +3 or greater enchantment. Magical lightning could slow a bronze golem down, whilst magical fire could heal them. And because their bodies were constructed of bronze these golems were not subject to rust.
Much like iron golems, some bronze golems could breath noxious gas, whilst other bronze golems lacked this functionality.
In the month of Hammer, in the , a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff found themselves transported to the plane of Carceri after defending the githzerai fortress of TahDarr from a tanarri incursion. At the urgings of the fallen paladin Elendil, the adventurers sought out Mount Othrys and Cronus for a way back to Toril. When they entered the crumbling palace they found Cronus to be deep into some kind of Cosmic Game with the marilith Cucathne, who was entertaining him with the game in hopes of negotiating the use of Othrys as a tanarri staging ground against TahDarr. Cronus was unwilling to answer any questions that the mortals posed, but offered to gate them home if they would fight as part of his forces in the game.
As part of this "game of the gods" the adventurers each had their bodies and minds temporarily merged with a powerful fiend somewhere in the multiverse, then were placed in a combat arena. There they did battle with bronze golems and a weak child of the hecatoncheires, unintentionally slighting Cronus as they were creatures of his own realm. After the adventurers earned their trip home they found that the battle had actually occurred in Ravens Bluff, discovering the Ministry of Art to be in ruins.
A year later in 1374 DR, bronze golems were one of many varieties of golems used as guardians inside the Onyx Tower.
