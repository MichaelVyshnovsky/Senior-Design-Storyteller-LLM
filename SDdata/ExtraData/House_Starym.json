        "mainbody": "se '''Starym''' was an ultraconservative and powerful elven noble family that once inhabited the city of Cormanthor (later [[Myth Drannor]]) in the elven empire of [[Cormanthyr]]. Comprised chiefly of [[Gold elf | Gold elves]] but with some [[Moon elf | Moon elves]] as well, they became discontent when Coronal [[Eltargrim Irithyl]] allowed races such as [[gnome | gnomes]], [[halfling | halflings]] and [[dwarf | dwarves]] to inhabit the city. Their reputation as a trusted influential house was destroyed after they attacked the [[Elven Court]], subsequently most of the [[Gold elf | gold elves]] emigrated from [[Myth Drannor]].",
        "History": "The Starym Clan of elves had been in the city of Cormanthor for quite sometime, as a member of the 12 First Houses of Cormanthyr, (in fact, even their rivals admit to Starym being the First house, pinnacle of all that is noble and fine among the elves) but their notable history begins after the [[Dalereckoning]].  Starym, along with other old noble houses, put forward much resistance to the forward-thinking Coronal [[Eltargrim Irithyl]], and vehemently opposed his liberal ideas of opening the capital city to the N'Tel'Quess (the \"Not-People\"; anyone not an elf), where formerly it was barred against all but the elves. Despite their misgivings and participation in a rebellious attack on the Court (including the archmage and patriarch [[Aulathar Orbryn]]), the Coronal's wishes eventually passed with the [[Opening]] in [[261 DR]], when the city became [[Myth Drannor]].\n\nAngered by this, Starym, along with other minor families and four major houses ([[Bharaclaiev]], [[Hyshaanth]], [[Rhaevaem]], [[Telynnan]]) quit the city in [[262 DR]], leaving behind only small numbers of their people (mostly [[Gold elf | gold elves]]), bound for other more \"elven\" settlements throughout [[Cormanthyr]] and elsewhere beyond the woods.  Starym, as the only \"senior\" noble house to do so, fell under the law that their lands and properties would remain vacant for three hundred years, at which time, if not reclaimed, would default to the Coronal. Some of the family emigrated to [[Eaerlann]], [[Illefarn]] and the [[Thunder Peaks]]. Many of the clan's women and children moved south to [[Semberholme]].\n\nIn the decades that followed, the Starym clan had to rebuild its honour in the city, and those who stayed behind laboured to do so. They found resolve in both [[Josidiah Starym]] and [[Taleisin Starym]], both of great prestige. However, in [[500 DR]], the house heir [[Josidiah Starym]] embarked on a quest to recover the lost Ary'Velahr'Kerym (elfblade) to prove his worthiness to marry [[Aravae Irithyl]], the Coronal's daughter, heir to the throne, and Josidiah's true love. He vowed to return in a century's time.\n\nThe three hundred year right to their lands was restored in [[523 DR]] when younger [[Moon elf]] members of the clan returned to [[Myth Drannor]] and returned the clan to social power. These younger members were an off-shoot of the line tracing back to the Fourth [[Rysar]]. The current heir, [[Josidiah Starym]], having left on his famous quest 23 years earlier, left uncertainty about the house lordship, to the dismay of Coronal [[Eltargrim Irithyl | Eltargrim]], who thought [[Josidiah Starym | Josidiah]] an honourable [[Elf | elf]]. As a stalling measure, the Coronal demanded that the current lord draw his family's [[Moonblade | moonblade]] and prove the clan's loyalty to [[Myth Drannor]].{{fact}}\n\nThe lord at the time, [[Illitran Starym]] indeed would draw the blade, but not before he forged a pact with [[Moander]], disguised as a cleansing ritual, to gain the power to fool the [[Moonblade | moonblade]] and thus his family and the Coronal. The Starym Moonblade, later called ''Darkmoon'', was forged for him and its character-judging abilities were corrupted by Moander. The surrounding Mythal filled the void in the sword's power with a trace of Illitran's spirit and sentience. Illitran easily drew the blade. The blade passed on to Venali, Illitran's son, later (see below).\n\n[[Josidiah Starym]] returned to [[Myth Drannor]] in [[674 DR]] bringing not the lost [[Warblade]] but the [[Artblade]] instead. Dismayed as he learned that the Coronal and [[Aravae Irithyl]], his love, had passed, he declined his ascension to Lord Speaker of the house and instead took over the [[Akh'Faer]], becoming [[Spell-Major]] and joining the [[Council of Twelve]] by virtue of drawing the [[Artblade]]. Disgruntled by his replacement, the former [[Spell-Major]] [[Paeris Haladar]] attempted to slay [[Josidiah Starym | Josidiah]] in [[689 DR]], but failed.",
        "The Starym Moonblade": "During the assault by the [[Army of Darkness]] in [[714 DR]], Venali Starym hid the Moonblade in the family crypts, more concerned about his wealth than the city's fate.  He was discovered by [[Fiend | fiends]], and was forced to imbue within the sword a teleportation ability, which was again corrupted by the Mythal.  A piece of Venali's spirit, a cowardice and sense of self-preservation, accompanied the magic.  Venali escape to safety, but the sword could never teleport into the Mythal again. Venali took the blade with him from Cormanthyr to the [[Hullack Forest]], where he died of a strange wasting disease.\n\nThe moonblade passed on to Venali's niece, Seldanna, where it was used for many decades in Seldanna's raids on human and dwarven cities in the approaching Kingdom of [[Cormyr]].  She rebuilt much of the clan's fortunes in this way, and in the sword was imbued her insatiable greed and ability to locate precious metals and gems infallibly.\n\nWhen Seldanna's family group was eventually tracked down and slain for punishment by a half-elf descended from the [[Llundlar]] clan of Myth Drannor, the sword passed to Seldanna's only surviving son, who is known to history only as \"the Scourge\". The Scourge took his fanatical followers to the [[Stonelands]] where he founded the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]], the Victorious Blade of the People.  It was a secret organization of racial hatred that lasted many years beyond the life of the Scourge, who was eventually poisoned by his only child, a daughter known only as \"Black Lotus\", but not before a strong hatred of non-elves was instilled into the blade.\n\nBlack Lotus spent decades fighting madness in attempts to control the intelligent weapon, and eventually succeeded, but not before going insane and completing her family's fall into depravity.  She  terrorized the [[Inner Sea]] lands for years before making her return to Myth Drannor, where she would claim her \"rightful inheritance\".  She was crushed in an abandoned crypt after plundering significant amounts of treasure, and her spirit was entirely consumed in her moonblade, which would later possess the ability to project an image of her that could wail as a banshee. The blade quickly teleported itself from Myth Drannor and sought a new wielder.",

            "Haladar Clan": "The [[Haladar]] family fell from grace due to the vengeful attitude of its clan archmage, [[Paeris Haladar]], who, angered by his replacement as [[Spell-Major]] by [[Josidiah Starym]], tried to kill him and draw the [[Artblade]].
