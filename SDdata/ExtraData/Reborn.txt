The Reborn were servants of Mystra, usually Magisters, who were granted a new life for their service.
Those who underwent Mystras Choice and became Reborn retained their prior intelligence, but were put in a new, whole and healthy body. They kept, however, a reverence for magic no matter what it was possible for some to face Mystras Choice again, sometimes for as little as praying in a consecrated altar to her.
Blind reborn were deprived of any memories of their prior lives, but had the power to cast a spell this power was passed on to their offspring. However, casting this spell cost them some of their vitality.
Example spells they could cast included slightly modified invisibility, levitate, change self, blindness, strength, minor creation, locate object or obscure object, dispel magic, affect normal fires, dancing lights, feather fall, mending, light, shield, spider climb, darkness, ESP, wraithform, sleep, or flaming sphere.
Wise reborn kept their memories, but could only cast the spells they could use or were immune to as Magisters, once per day each. Never able to become magicians again, some found this to be a torment. They also gained the ability to, at will, turn themselves into wingless wonders, though they could not shift back at will they only had the option to do this when touched by magic.
Noum√©a Drathchuld was an exception, neither blind nor wise, to the general rules for the Reborn.
A few Reborn became Masters of Doors at Mystran temples. Others became spell component merchants, and patrons of adventurers, who sought old magic. Others became sages per the Heralds, there were two that entered Candlekeep, and at least one retired to Highmoon in Deepingdale. A rare few became "sorcerer-slayers" (bounty hunters) or "magic hunters" (adventurers).
