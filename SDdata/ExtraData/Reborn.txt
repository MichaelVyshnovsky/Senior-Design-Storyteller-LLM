The '''Reborn''' were servants of [[Mystra]], usually [[Magister]]s, who were granted a new life for their service.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|20-22}}

==Rebirth==
Those who underwent [[Mystra's Choice]] and became Reborn retained their prior intelligence, but were put in a new, whole and healthy body. They kept, however, a reverence for magic no matter what; it was possible for some to face [[Mystra's Choice]] again, sometimes for as little as praying in a consecrated altar to her.

===Blind Reborn===
Blind reborn were deprived of any memories of their prior lives, but had the power to cast a spell; this power was passed on to their offspring. However, casting this spell cost them some of their vitality.

Example spells they could cast included slightly modified ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[change self]]'', ''[[blindness]]'', ''[[strength]]'', ''[[minor creation]]'', ''[[locate object]]'' or ''[[obscure object]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[affect normal fires]]'', ''[[dancing lights]]'', ''[[feather fall]]'', ''[[mending]]'', ''[[light]]'', ''[[shield]]'', ''[[spider climb]]'', ''[[darkness]]'', ''[[ESP]]'', ''[[wraithform]]'', ''[[sleep]]'', or ''[[flaming sphere]]''.

===Wise Reborn===
Wise reborn kept their memories, but could only cast the spells they could use or were immune to as [[Magister]]s, once per day each. Never able to become magicians again, some found this to be a torment. They also gained the ability to, at will, turn themselves into [[wingless wonder]]s, though they could not shift back at will; they only had the option to do this when touched by magic.

==Known Reborn==
[[Noum√©a Drathchuld]] was an exception, neither blind nor wise, to the general rules for the Reborn.

==Rumors & Legends==
A few Reborn became Masters of Doors at [[Mystra]]n temples. Others became spell component merchants, and patrons of adventurers, who sought old magic. Others became sages; per the [[Heralds]], there were two that entered [[Candlekeep]], and at least one retired to [[Highmoon]] in [[Deepingdale]]. A rare few became "sorcerer-slayers" (bounty hunters) or "magic hunters" (adventurers).
