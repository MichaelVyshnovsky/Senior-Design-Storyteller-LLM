Jolly Roger was the name for a style of flag associated with piracy across much of the Realms, dating as far back as the 1160s DR. Some alternatively used the term skull and crossbones or, if feeling whimsical, pirates referred to it as "the old flaggy waggy".
A Jolly Roger flag was traditionally black, with a depiction of a human skull and two crossed leg bones done in white.

This style of flag was used by pirates across much of the Sea of Fallen Stars, including those of the Pirate Isles.
* Bartholomew Blackdagger, a notorious pirate king, wore a hat bearing the saber variant of the Jolly Roger.
* Captain Morgan, a pirate captain that was infamous in Ravens Bluff, flew the skull and crossbones on his ship.
* Nishan of the Nine Wonders, a pirate in the Sea of Fallen Stars, flew the Jolly Roger on his ship.
The origins of this style of flag and the name attributed to it were both a mystery, though many suggested that the term Jolly Roger may have derived from a corruption of Jhalanrojir, a Turmic word meaning "mark of the rogue" and the name of the legendary Pirateshield. This shield was fashioned from the shell of a blackback turtle that had apparently naturally formed the image of a skull and crossed bones on it.
