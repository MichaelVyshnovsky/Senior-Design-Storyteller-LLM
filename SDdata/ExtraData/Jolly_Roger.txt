'''Jolly Roger''' was the name for a style of flag associated with piracy across much of the Realms,{{Cite organized play/LC/Sea Dog Stories|25}} dating as far back as the 1160s [[DR]]. Some alternatively used the term '''skull and crossbones''' or, if feeling whimsical, pirates referred to it as "the old flaggy waggy".

==Description==
A Jolly Roger flag was traditionally black, with a depiction of a [[human]] skull and two crossed leg bones done in white.

==History==
The origins of this style of flag and the name attributed to it were both a mystery, though many suggested that the term Jolly Roger may have derived from a corruption of ''Jhalanrojir'', a [[Turmic]] word meaning "mark of the rogue" and the name of the legendary ''[[Jhalanrojir|Pirateshield]]''. This shield was fashioned from the shell of a [[turtle|blackback turtle]] that had apparently naturally formed the image of a skull and crossed bones on it.
