'''Death magic''' was an effect that guaranteed death, usually immediately, though it was possible to resist it.<ref group="note">Note that death magic was not specifically linked to [[necromancy]]. Several schools of magic utilized death magic, such as [[evocation]], [[conjuration]], [[abjuration]], etc.

==Description==
===Main Forms===
Death magic came in many forms, the most common of which were [[spell]]s, such as ''[[finger of death]]'', and supernatural creature abilities, such as a [[beholder]]'s death ray. some involving transportation to other planes, or otherwise. Most of these effects could specifically cause instant-death to an inhabitant if they failed to resist it. Death magic was not dependent on the amount of damage a spell or effect could deal. As such, a highly powerful ''[[fireball]]'' was not a form a death magic, even though it could kill most beings outright.

===Other Forms===
Almost all death magic caused instantaneous death. However, some forms, such as the effect of ''[[breath of death]]'' spell, instead instantly infected a being with a fatal [[disease]]. The infected beings were unable to heal naturally or via [[magic]]al [[cure wounds|curing]], meaning they would certainly die, unless they somehow found a way around it. 

Another form of death magic was noted to exist in [[Constabulary Branch One]] of [[Karsus Enclave]] in [[Netheril]]. A net of interwoven spells within this maze-like building could cause a refraction effect, causing the being to instantly undergo ''[[reincarnation]]''.

When travelling to the [[Ethereal plane]], i.e., via ''[[blink]]'' or ''[[ethereal jaunt]]'', it was possible to reappear inside of a solid object. Failing to resist this form of death magic would cause instant death, though managing to resist it would cause the affected being to plummet into the Deep Ethereal.

==Notable Death Magic Spells==
There were several spells that utilized death magic, such as ''finger of death'', ''[[implosion]]'', ''[[death spell]]'', ''[[power word, kill]]'', and ''[[black blade of disaster]]''. Some of these spells drew magic from either the [[Negative Energy plane|Negative]] (or [[Positive Energy plane|positive]]) [[Negative Energy plane|energy plane]] in order to harm [[good]] (or [[evil]]) creatures. Spells that involved death magic could be resisted by the ''[[death ward]]'' spell, as long as it was cast on the target beforehand. 

Some notable spells were:
* ''[[Slay living]]'', the reverse of ''[[raise dead]]'', would instantly kill a target if they could not save themselves against its death magic.

* ''[[The great circle]]'' spell, a very powerful spell that could only be cast by a group of of four or more [[priest]]s. It instantly destroyed all lesser [[undead]] within a huge radius, though it was possible for other [[evil]] beings to resist the death magic. The opposite of this spell, ''the black circle'', had a similar effect on goodly creatures, especially if they were [[paladin]]s or good-aligned priests.

==Notable Death Magic-using Beings==

===Creatures===
* [[Nabassu]], known as death stealers, were able to "steal the death" of their victims via a deadly gaze. As such, the victims would not experience death at such a moment, but instead would become a [[ghast]] or a [[ghoul]] as soon as they were actually killed. The ghoul or ghast would become controllable by the nabassu. As the nabassu had already "stolen death", it was able to bestow the stolen death upon a victim, instantly killing them.

* [[Ochimo]], [[evil]] spirit warriors from [[Kara-Tur]], whose gaze could capture the entire spirit of a being.

===Inhabitants===
* [[Tyranthraxus]], the possessing spirit, was known to literally transfer his life force into anothers body.

==Notable Death Magic-immune Beings==
===Creatures===
* [[Monadic deva|Modanic]] and [[movanic deva]]s, and [[solars]], goodly outsiders that were immune to death magic in all forms.

===Inhabitants===
* [[Kamerynn]], a highly intelligent, powerful, and death magic-immune [[unicorn]] that lived on the [[Moonshae Isles]].
