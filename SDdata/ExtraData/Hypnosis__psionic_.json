        "mainbody": "'''''Hypnosis''''', also known as '''''post-hypnotic suggestion''''', was a minor [[psionic]] devotion of the [[telepathic]] discipline that allowed one to implant a command into another creature.",
        "Effects": "This power was described by some as being similar to the [[spell]]s ''[[charm person]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', or ''[[suggestion]]'' Older variants of the power allowed one to outright instruct a creature to undertake a reasonable course of action&mdash;this meant one could not instruct a creature to do things such as killing themselves or their friends&mdash;as well as implant a post-hypnotic suggestion within their subconscious. This post-hypnotic suggestion had a small chance of wearing off with every proceeding day.\n\nIn later years, this minor devotion only allowed a psionicist to implant a post-hypnotic suggestion, as well as what situation would trigger the action. This suggestion likewise had to be a reasonable course of action, that being something that would not go against the creature's [[alignment]].\n\nEither version of this power could only affect creatures that were semi-intelligent or exceptionally intelligent. Anything less than or greater than this, creatures that were very dim or brilliant, were not susceptible. If the power back-fired on the psionicist, the victim would be made aware of the ''post-hypnotic suggestion''.",
        "Prerequisite Powers": "In order to learn this power, a psionicist first had to possess the powers ''[[contact]]'' and ''[[mindlink]]''.",
        "Known Users": "* [[Greater shedu]].<ref><ref>\n* [[Mind flayer]]s<ref><ref> as well as [[illithilich]]es.<ref>\n* Some psionic [[yuan-ti]] possessed this power.<ref><ref>",
        "Notable Users": "* [[Lugribossk]], a [[proxy]] of the god [[Ilsensine]].\n* [[Ralayan]], an infamous illithilich.<ref>"
