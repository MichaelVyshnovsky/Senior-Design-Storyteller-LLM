A '''jack-in-the-box''' was a type of children's toy that could be found in both the Realms particularly in the domains of [[Barovia]] and [[w:c:ravenloft:Odiare|Odiare]].

==Description==
This toy outwardly consisted of a [[music box]] with a [[hinge]]d lid and a crank that, when wound, would produce a distinctive melody. Once this crank was turned a sufficient number of times an internal mechanism would be triggered, causing the lid to pop open and some type of figure to spring out.<ref>

==Availability==
* In the Domain of Barovia, the toysmith [[Gadof Blinsky]] of [[Vallaki]] sold macabre jack-in-the-boxes shaped like [[coffin]]s that contained a [[puppet]] modeled after [[Strahd von Zarovich]].

==Notable Owners==
* The [[Cassalanter]] family owned and kept a jack-in-the-box within their [[Cassalanter villa|villa]]'s playroom in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
