A jack-in-the-box was a type of childrens toy that could be found in both the Realms particularly in the domains of Barovia and Odiare.
This toy outwardly consisted of a music box with a hinged lid and a crank that, when wound, would produce a distinctive melody. Once this crank was turned a sufficient number of times an internal mechanism would be triggered, causing the lid to pop open and some type of figure to spring out.
* In the Domain of Barovia, the toysmith Gadof Blinsky of Vallaki sold macabre jack-in-the-boxes shaped like coffins that contained a puppet modeled after Strahd von Zarovich.
* The Cassalanter family owned and kept a jack-in-the-box within their villas playroom in the late 15 century DR.
