        "mainbody": "theruses4|an obscure group of Umberlant drow|the [[sea elf]] subrace that worshiped Umberlee and were sometimes referred to as \"sea drow\"|Marel}}\nThe '''aquatic drow''' were a group of [[drow]] in [[the Vast]], [[Waveservant]]s in the [[Church of Umberlee]], that were blessed by the goddess [[Umberlee]] with aquatic traits in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Descent into the Deep|2}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"aquatic\">How exactly these drow differ from normal drow is never elaborated upon in ''Descent into the Deep'', beyond the fact that they can seemingly breathe in water. Some of the drow encountered in the adventure on pages 10 and 11 are not given a swim speed, though that may just be an oversight or an indication that they are normal drow.",
        "Description": "In addition to having the dark skin typical of drow, these offshoot drow had green eyes and light green hair.{{Cite organized play/LC/Descent into the Deep|19}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"green\">It is unclear if these traits are common to all of the aquatic drow or just unique to Khara.",
        "History": "Sometime after being transformed by Umberlee the aquatic drow were approached by an [[avatar]] of her, who told them that she was enraged that the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] didn't name the Church of Umberlee as one of the faiths that made up their civic religion and ordered them to disrupt the city's naval commerce as retribution. This was all a clever ruse though, as Umberlee merely wanted to test the devotion, cunning, and capabilities of the aquatic drow.\n\nAround [[1370 DR]], the drow constructed a temple within the [[sewers of Ravens Bluff]], beneath the district of [[Crow's End]]. They then sent out a [[human]] [[priest]] to both capture maritime merchants and convert sailors to their faith. However, their temple was eventually discovered and destroyed. Fearful that their incompetence might incur Umberlee's wrath, the aquatic drow scrambled to redouble their efforts to disrupt Ravenian shipping lanes.{{Cite organized play/LC/Descent into the Deep|7}}\n\nTheir plans began in earnest sometime around the winter season, not long after the end of the [[War with Myrkyssa Jelan]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Descent into the Deep|3}} The drow allied themselves with [[kuo-toa]]ns and [[sahuagin]]s, some of them fellow Umberlants, to attack Ravenian ships. They also hired various [[spellcaster]]s, [[charm]]ed pirates, and utilized a number of human servitors. The Ravenians eventually requested help from their neighbor [[Procampur]], who agreed to send a naval relief force to defend the [[Ravens Bluff Harbor]]. Having caught wind of this, the drow assembled a force of kuo-toans and [[merfolk]] to intercept the relief fleet. Unaffiliated merfolk would inturn report of their whereabouts to the Ravenians. In response the Regent of the Harbor, Lord [[Calvin Longbottle]], would sent out one group of adventurers to scout out and possibly destroy the headquarters and another to establish a new treaty with a nearby kingdom of merfolk to protect the relief fleet.\n\nHitching a ride on the ''[[Blackmantleâ€™s Revenge]]'' and using a special variant of ''[[Potion of water breathing|potions of water breathing]]'', discovered by agents of the [[Guild of Magical Arts]] during the war, the first group of adventurers made their way into the depths of the Inner Sea and found the sinkhole leading into the lair of the aquatic drow. Inside they fought an [[eye of the deep]],{{Cite organized play/LC/Descent into the Deep|8}} Eventually they made their way up into an air-filled chamber housing caged victims of the many ships attacked by the drow and the main temple complex.{{Cite organized play/LC/Descent into the Deep|9}} There they faced off against the leader of the drow [[Kiana]] along with her present allies. These included a male human wizard, a female human Waveservant, a kuo-toa, a [[Sahuagin#Mutations|sahuagin baron]], and a [[morkoth]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Descent into the Deep|9-11}}\n\nBy the time the adventurers returned to Ravens Bluff their victory had already been reported upon by merfolk to Lord Calvin Longbottle and Lord Chancellor [[Arvin Kothonos]]. The two greeted the adventurers at the docks, promising to hold a grand ball in their honor later that evening at the [[Blacktree Manor]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Descent into the Deep|11-12}}",
        "Notable Aquatic Drow": "* [[Khara]], an aquatic drow that worked with the Captain of the Guard of a merfolk village in the Inner Sea to undermine it so that her people would be free to attack the relief fleet being sent from Procampur.\n* Kiana, a leader among the aquatic drow."
