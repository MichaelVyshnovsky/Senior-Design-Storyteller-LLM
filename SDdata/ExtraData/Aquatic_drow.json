        "mainbody": "The aquatic drow were a group of drow in the Vast, Waveservants in the Church of Umberlee, that were blessed by the goddess Umberlee with aquatic traits in the late 14 century DR.How exactly these drow differ from normal drow is never elaborated upon in Descent into the Deep, beyond the fact that they can seemingly breathe in water. Some of the drow encountered in the adventure on pages 10 and 11 are not given a swim speed, though that may just be an oversight or an indication that they are normal drow.\nIn addition to having the dark skin typical of drow, these offshoot drow had green eyes and light green hair.It is unclear if these traits are common to all of the aquatic drow or just unique to Khara.\nSometime after being transformed by Umberlee the aquatic drow were approached by an avatar of her, who told them that she was enraged that the city of Ravens Bluff didnt name the Church of Umberlee as one of the faiths that made up their civic religion and ordered them to disrupt the citys naval commerce as retribution. This was all a clever ruse though, as Umberlee merely wanted to test the devotion, cunning, and capabilities of the aquatic drow.\nAround 1370 DR, the drow constructed a temple within the sewers of Ravens Bluff, beneath the district of Crows End. They then sent out a human priest to both capture maritime merchants and convert sailors to their faith. However, their temple was eventually discovered and destroyed. Fearful that their incompetence might incur Umberlees wrath, the aquatic drow scrambled to redouble their efforts to disrupt Ravenian shipping lanes.\nTheir plans began in earnest sometime around the winter season, not long after the end of the War with Myrkyssa Jelan. The drow allied themselves with kuo-toans and sahuagins, some of them fellow Umberlants, to attack Ravenian ships. They also hired various spellcasters, charmed pirates, and utilized a number of human servitors. The Ravenians eventually requested help from their neighbor Procampur, who agreed to send a naval relief force to defend the Ravens Bluff Harbor. Having caught wind of this, the drow assembled a force of kuo-toans and merfolk to intercept the relief fleet. Unaffiliated merfolk would inturn report of their whereabouts to the Ravenians. In response the Regent of the Harbor, Lord Calvin Longbottle, would sent out one group of adventurers to scout out and possibly destroy the headquarters and another to establish a new treaty with a nearby kingdom of merfolk to protect the relief fleet.\nHitching a ride on the Blackmantleâ€™s Revenge and using a special variant of potions of water breathing, discovered by agents of the Guild of Magical Arts during the war, the first group of adventurers made their way into the depths of the Inner Sea and found the sinkhole leading into the lair of the aquatic drow. Inside they fought an eye of the deep, Eventually they made their way up into an air-filled chamber housing caged victims of the many ships attacked by the drow and the main temple complex. There they faced off against the leader of the drow Kiana along with her present allies. These included a male human wizard, a female human Waveservant, a kuo-toa, a sahuagin baron, and a morkoth.\nBy the time the adventurers returned to Ravens Bluff their victory had already been reported upon by merfolk to Lord Calvin Longbottle and Lord Chancellor Arvin Kothonos. The two greeted the adventurers at the docks, promising to hold a grand ball in their honor later that evening at the Blacktree Manor.\n* Khara, an aquatic drow that worked with the Captain of the Guard of a merfolk village in the Inner Sea to undermine it so that her people would be free to attack the relief fleet being sent from Procampur.\n* Kiana, a leader among the aquatic drow."
