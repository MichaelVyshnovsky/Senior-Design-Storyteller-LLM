The '''Sandvoyagers Track''', also known as the '''Sandvoyagers Trail''', was a trail of footprints that cut across the [[Raurin]]. The [[Sandvoyagers Guild]] both created those tracks in their passage and used them to orient themselves.
==Structure==
Its sharp turns were announced by guideposts from which hung [[silver]] bangles stamped with the symbol of the [[Sandvoyagers Guild]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|26}}
==Path==
The trail began on the south at [[Northknife Pass]] amongst the [[Dustwall Mountains]]; it continued northwest across the desert towards the [[Gates of Sule]], then went north towards a guidepost pointing the way to [[Terbakar]] and [[Pazar]] before joining with the bed of the dry [[River Athis]] for some time, crossing through both the [[Oasis of Akhir]] and the [[Oasis of the White Palm]]. The track briefly split from the river past this point; it rejoined the dry riverbed closer to [[Medinat Muskawoon]].
