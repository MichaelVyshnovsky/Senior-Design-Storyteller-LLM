thumb|right|300px|Some mortals carried with them constant reminders of the infernal contracts they entered into.
An infernal contract was a binding agreement between one individual and a devil of the Nine Hells. It typically involved the devil granting a significant boon or gift to an individual, and the contractee owing a specific debt to the fiend.
Contracts varied in form and appearance, but were often presented with grand theatricality, such as appearing within a cloud of smoke or delivered by an imp. Some of the more common forms contracts could take included written in blood on a scroll of vellum, inscribed upon stone formed by rapidly cooling lava,
While infernal contracts were always written in the Infernal script, they could be endorsed by several means. A devil might only require the bound party to sign upon a parchment while others might dictate an act of depravity be performed.
Once the devil and the agreeing party each entered into the contract willfully, the devils boon was bestowed and its beneficiary was indebted to pay a pre-specified price.
If the contractee was unwilling or became otherwise unable to fulfill their end of the bargain, they suffered one or more penalties as outlined by the contract. Customary penalties included the forfeiture of all owned material wealth, the unwilling adoption of one or more fiendish physical characteristics, or transference of ones mortal soul to the offended party.
Infernal contracts could be voided so long as both parties agreed. Under these circumstances, the devil and the contractee each continued on with their existences as if the contract never existed to begin with. Devils often requested significant compensation before agreeing to nullify an infernal contract. Compensation for nullification often included endowment of great personal wealth, one or more soul coins, or extremely powerful artifacts.
Contracts that were not fully ratified could be broken by other supernatural means, though the exact specifications of this were unclear. A devil talisman crafted from the blood of an empyrean and powered by the soul of a mortal was one known method.
