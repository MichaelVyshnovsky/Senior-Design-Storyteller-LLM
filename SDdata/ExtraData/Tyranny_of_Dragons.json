        "Description": "The [[Wizards of the Coast]] provided the following introduction to the Tyranny of Dragons: \n{{Quote|''For years, the evil [[Cult of the Dragon]] has devoted itself to creating [[undead]] dragons in a vain attempt to fulfill an ancient prophecy. However, the cultists were misguided. They misunderstood. But now, under new leadership, the cult believes that the prophecy does not speak of undead dragons, but of a dragon empire that's been extinct for 25,000 years. [[Tiamat]], the queen of evil dragons, has languished in the [[Nine Hells]] for millennia. The cult believes that the time of her return is at hand.''\n\n''The cult has a new face and a new mission. It seeks to free Tiamat from the Nine Hells and bring her into the [[Forgotten Realms]]. To accomplish its goal, the cult needs five ancient dragon masks and the support of evil dragons everywhere. The cult leaders—each one a \"dragon whisperer\"—have reached out to the evil dragons of the [[Sword Coast]] and earned their allegiance.''\n\n''Meanwhile, evil dragons in partnership with the cult seek to amass a treasure hoard worthy of their dark queen, not by plundering their own hoards (of course) but by stealing money from cities, caravans, good-aligned dragons, merchant ships, and other sources. Their ravenous hunt for treasure throws the Sword Coast into upheaval. [[Neverwinter]], [[Waterdeep]], [[Baldur's Gate]]—no city is safe from their depredations.''\n\n''The situation is dire. However, the Sword Coast is far from defenseless. Powerful factions are ready to rise up and put an end to the tyranny of dragons. Adventurers throughout the Realms must join forces to face Tiamat, destroy the Cult of the Dragon, and prevent the rise of a new dragon empire. The [[Harpers]] have since shared their intelligence with the remaining factions. To combat the Cult of the Dragon, Lord [[Dagult Neverember]] of Neverwinter proposes that adventurers representing each of the five factions be sent north to investigate—and to report back with haste.''\n\n''In their hands, the future lies.''|Tyranny of Dragons storyline\n{{cite web |url= http://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/story/tyrannyofdragons|title=Tyranny of Dragons |accessdate=2015-08-27 |format= |work=Wizards.com}}}}",
