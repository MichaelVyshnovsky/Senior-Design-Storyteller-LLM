'''Bardic colleges''' were organizations specialized in the training of [[bard]]s, as well as the name given to loose associations of bards that followed similar particular styles as they pursued their studies. As a way of learning, they were considered an alternative to the traditional method of apprenticeship under a single master.

==History==
===The Seven Elder Bardic Colleges===
The tradition of bardic colleges started with [[Falataer]], a bard from the [[Moonshaes]] who established a college divided into seven levels of skill. In time, those individual levels became known as separate colleges in their own right, referred to as the elder bardic colleges.

The elder bardic colleges were ranked by their original levels and strictly respected that hierarchy. Bardic students who wanted to progress in their knowledge traditionally attended all seven colleges, in that order. A bard who attended all seven colleges then acquired the title of [[Magna Alumnae]].

The seven elder colleges were:

;[[Fochlucan]]:
:Located in [[Silverymoon]], it represented the first level of skill. Before its decline, bards graduating in the Fochlucan college were awarded a ''[[Fochlucan bandore]]''.

;[[Mac-Fuirmidh]]:
:Located in the northern [[Moonshaes]], it represented the second level of skill. Before its decline, bards graduating in the Mac-Fuirmidh college were awarded a ''[[Mac-Fuirmidh cittern]]''.

;[[Doss]]:
:Located in [[Berdusk]], it represented the third level of skill. Before its decline, bards graduating in the Doss college were awarded a ''[[Doss lute]]''.

;[[Canaith]]:
:Located near [[Zazesspur]] in [[Tethyr]], it represented the fourth level of skill. Before its decline, bards graduating in the Canaith college were awarded a ''[[Canaith mandolin]]''.

;[[Cli]]:
:It represented the fifth level of skill. Before its decline, bards graduating in the Cli college were awarded a ''[[Cli lyre]]''.

;[[Anstruth]]:
:Located in [[Sundabar]], it represented the sixth level of skill. Before its decline, bards graduating in the Anstruth college were awarded an ''[[Anstruth harp]]''.

;[[New Olamn|Ollamh]]:
:Located in [[Waterdeep]], it represented the seventh and final level of skill. Before its decline, bards graduating in the Ollamh college were awarded an ''[[Ollamh harp]]''.

By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], most of the bardic colleges had long since entered decline and ceased their activities. However, the styles of play of some colleges were still recognizable in certain players, and older bards still sometimes referred to each other by their ranks in the elder colleges.

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, only Ollamh, renamed as [[New Olamn]], and a newly reopened Fochlucan were still operational in their original locations.

==Notable Bardic Colleges==
* The [[College of the Herald]], located in [[Herald's Holdfast]], focused on the preservation of and organization of lore for peaceful purposes.

* One of more fanciful bardic colleges was located in [[Berdusk]], favored by local nobles. [[Joel]] of [[Finder Wyvernspur|Finder]] spent some time studying there, before pursuing the calling of a [[cleric]], to his parents' chagrin.

Other known loose associations of bards included the following colleges:

* The [[College of Glamour]] was favored by bards with strong connections to the [[Feywild]] who had spent time there or studied under the tutelage of one of its inhabitants.

* The [[College of Lore]] focused on amassing knowledge and collecting lore from different sources, in an endless pursuit of beauty and truth. This bardic style was followed by bards of many formal organizations, such as the College of the Herald.

* The [[College of Swords]] focused on amazing feats of prowess with weapons. Bards of this college, known as [[Blade (class)|blades]], used their talent with weapons both to entertain and to fight against injustice.

* The [[College of Valor]] was the style followed by fighting bards who sang of great deeds in battle. It was common among the [[skald]]s of the [[Northlander]]s and the [[Reghedmen]].

* The [[College of Whispers]] was a secretive way, chosen by bards who thrived on discovering secrets, as well as spreading intrigue and sowing discord. They tended to be viewed negatively by other bards.

* The Order of Fabulists was the vocation taught at the obscure College of Bards of [[Orlil]]. The college granted licenses to lecture to its graduates who were filled to the brim with knowledge of stories and lore. The fabulists were repositories of [[book]] knowledge, however obscure it was, and grammar was strictly enforced among these bards. The fabulists were known to include members of a little known sentient [[wombat]] race from a small island off the coast of Orlil. [[Byrt]], a companion of [[Artus Cimber]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], was a fabulist of note.{{Template:Cite book/The Ring of Winter|212|12}}
