The '''Night of Pirates''' was an event that took place in the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep]] late in the month of [[Uktar]] in the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]].

A pirate-lord hailing from the [[Nelanther Isles]], [[Elro Starankh]], led ninety-six crewmen from three ships into the [[Heartflame]] festhall on [[Snail Street]]. He proceeded to offer the proprietress, famed madam [[Nauloene Tharantra]], a commission of twenty [[Dragon (coin)|dragons]] for each girl who agreed to marry one of the seadogs. Each bride was to receive ten thousand dragons as a dowry in reverse. Only two of the ladies of the evening turned down the offer and a wild celebration with drinking and dancing ensued.

At some point in the revels, Starankh set fire to the festhall and it burned beyond the point of salvation. The relatively fancy [[Arrowsar Apartments]] were eventually built on the site of the former festhall.{{Cite web/Waterdeep News/Tharantra Husband-Hunting Again}}
