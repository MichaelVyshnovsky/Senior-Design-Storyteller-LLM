It contained the spirit of Treth Halonter who could be called forth by the chalices owner. Treths spirit was forced to obey the commands of the owner.  \nThe chalice was displayed in the royal palace in Suzail for many years but was stolen as a drunken prank by Nethglas Stormserpent sometime in the 1470s DR. When the chalices theft stirred the war wizards into a frenzy, Nethglas became worried and stashed the chalice in the Chamber of Wyrms Ascending in the palace. In 1479 DR, his younger brother, Marlin, retrieved the chalice from the palace. Marlin called forth Treth and Relve Langrals spirit from the Flying Blade and sent them on a killing spree through Suzail.  \nElminster sought the chalice and the other relics to feed to Alassra Silverhand to restore her sanity. \nCategoryMagic items\nCategoryWondrous items\nCategoryCups\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Interior Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\nCategoryItems from the Eastern Heartlands\nCategoryItems from Suzail\nCategoryItems from Cormyr\n5ospsixsirlgze7oaljf8theycediaw"
