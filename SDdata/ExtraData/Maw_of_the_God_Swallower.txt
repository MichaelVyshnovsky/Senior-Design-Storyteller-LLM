The Maw of the God Swallower was an oblong-shaped region of utter annihilation in southern Chessenta in the late 15th century DR.
Along the edges, the ground crumbled away and the sky was dark. In the interior of the region, the land fell away into a void and the primordial Entropy hung in the exact center of the void.Brian R. James.  "Backdrop Chessenta" Dungeon #178. Renton, WA Wizards of the Coast, May, 2010.
