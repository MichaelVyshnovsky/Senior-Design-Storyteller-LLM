The '''Maw of the God Swallower''' was an oblong-shaped region of utter annihilation in southern [[Chessenta]] in the late 15th century [[DR]].

Along the edges, the ground crumbled away and the sky was dark. In the interior of the region, the land fell away into a void and the [[primordial]] [[Entropy]] hung in the exact center of the void.[[Brian R. James]].  "Backdrop: Chessenta" ''[[Dungeon magazine|Dungeon]]'' #178. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, May, 2010.
