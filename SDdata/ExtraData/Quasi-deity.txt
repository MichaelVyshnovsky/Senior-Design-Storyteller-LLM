A '''quasi-deity''', also called a '''hero deity''', was a term to describe the lowest rank of the [[deity|deities]].

==Description==
A quasi-deity once meant that a being was immortal and superior to any mortal creature. Some quasi-deities could not grant spells. A quasi-deity was completely immune to every attempt to tamper with its mind, sap its vitality, or force it into a different form. It had a strong defense against magic but only a limited defense against heat. Weapons not enchanted with magic of an epic scope could not hurt a quasi-deity without problems. These defenses against magic, heat, and non-magical physical attacks grew stronger as a deity rose in rank.{{cite web

}} After the events of the [[Second Sundering]], the [[Dead Three]] became quasi-deities.

==Society==
Quasi-deities were subdivided in three categories:

;[[Demigod]]s : Creatures born of the union between a deity and a mortal. This was the weakest form of quasi-deity.

;Titans : These creatures were created by deities. Titans could come into being deliberately, such as through being forged or willed into existence by a deity or as the offspring of two deities; or unwittingly, such as the blood spilled by a deity.

;Vestiges : Deities who had lost their followers and became nearly powerless. They were regarded as "dead" by mortals, but could still be contacted and still possessed some latent power.

[[True dragon]]s could attain quasi-godhood by mastering the art of a [[dragon ascendant]].

If a quasi-deity amassed a sufficiently high number of followers, it could then ascend to true godhood.

==Notable Quasi-Deities==
* [[Tchazzar]] was a fully developed dragon ascendant who granted spells to his own church.
* The [[Dead Three]]: [[Bane]], [[Bhaal]], and [[Myrkul]].
