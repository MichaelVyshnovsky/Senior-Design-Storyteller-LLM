A blade was a type of sharp-edged melee weapon. Blades, particularly swords and daggers, were used throughout Faer√ªn and beyond.
Blades were specifically used to cut and slice. Such items were hand-held slashing weapons made of metal or other rigid material. Specifically for blades, the cutting edge made up most of the length of the weapon, unlike axes and pole arms, where the cutting edge was much shorter than the overall length. As such, examples of blades were swords (short or long), daggers (very short, double edged), and knives (very short, single edged).
