A '''favored monster''' was a kind of monster that was favored by a [[deity]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|8}}

==Description==
Deities could show their powers through major manifestations and minor manifestations. The appearance of a monster fell into the latter category.

Unlike other minor manifestations, these manifestations were not sent to inform mortals of something but as a means for direct aid. This aid could be to attack or protect against enemies. who were servants of [[Vhaeraun]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|15}}

[[Outsider]] servants were sent with a specific mission for a specific time frame.

==Mortals' Reaction==
Mortals could react in a fearful manner to a favored monster. Deities generally tried to accommodate these fears by sending monsters who were familiar to them or a [[favored animal]] instead.

[[Cleric]]s could summon these monsters by using ''[[planar ally]]'' or ''[[summon monster]]'' [[spell]]s.
