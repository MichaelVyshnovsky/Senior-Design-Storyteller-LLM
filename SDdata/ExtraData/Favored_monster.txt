A favored monster was a kind of monster that was favored by a deity.

Outsider servants were sent with a specific mission for a specific time frame.
Mortals could react in a fearful manner to a favored monster. Deities generally tried to accommodate these fears by sending monsters who were familiar to them or a favored animal instead.
Clerics could summon these monsters by using planar ally or summon monster spells.
