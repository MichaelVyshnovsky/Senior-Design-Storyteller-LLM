The '''Tearfall''', also known as '''''ileleste''''' (falling rain, in [[Elven language|Elven]]), the '''changing of the stars''', the '''seven-turn winter''', or the '''month of mist''', was a planet-wide disaster that struck [[Abeir-Toril]] in the final millennium of the [[Days of Thunder]]. It was widely believed [[dragon|dragonkind]] was created as a consequence of the Tearfall.

The '''Tearfall''' was in fact the '''Sundering''', the event when the worlds of [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]] were originally separated. As such, this event was related to the [[First Sundering|First]] and [[Second Sundering]]s.{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAoq-vwWHHg|title=What is the Sundering?

==History==
According to the ''[[Parwiccan Cycle]]'', a devastating [[meteor]] rain fell in {{Yearlink|-31000}},

Scholars from [[Candlekeep]] had the theory that those natural catastrophes were the consequence of a comet or an ice moon that fell from the sky and devastated much of the planet, and referred to this event as the Tearfall. According to their theory, the dramatic climate change that followed quickly brought an end to the [[batrachi]] civilization and allowed the rapid evolution of [[proto-dragon]]s into the various dragon species.

The [[red dragon]]s' creation myth compiled in the ''[[Book of the World]]'' tells a similar history, in which the [[dragon]] [[deity]] [[Asgorath]] cast down an entity known as [[Zotha]] after creating the world and then he proceeded to create dragonkind.

According to Abeiran scholars, however, the Tearfall was actually caused by the actions of the batrachi. As they were losing their war against the [[titan]]s, they performed a powerful summoning ritual and released several [[primordials]] from their ancient prisons. The [[god]]s quickly moved against their ancient foes, and it was those battles that caused the worldwide catastrophes that destroyed the batrachi civilization. A primordial known as "Asgorath the World-Shaper", determined to destroy the world if he couldn't control it, threw an ice moon at the planet, creating the Sea of Fallen Stars. Before the world was completely destroyed, Lord [[Ao]] intervened and sundered Abeir-Toril into two twin worlds, Abeir and Toril, giving the former to the primordials and the latter (the original world) to the gods, ending the conflict.

Nobody knew for sure if Asgorath actually threw dragon eggs to the world when he cast down the ice moon, although dragons revered Asgorath as the creator of their race. 

A similar event, also called a "Tearfall", happened in [[1374 DR]], when many dragon eggs fell from the sky across [[Faer√ªn]] on an unusual year-long meteor rain, after the dragon population was greatly reduced in number in the last [[Rage of Dragons]]. Most of the eggs were recovered by the followers of [[Tiamat]], a few by the followers of [[Bahamut]], and the ones that weren't found either hatched on their own or were lost.
