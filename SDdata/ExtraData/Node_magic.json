        "Effects": {
            "Additional Skills": "Apart from the aforementioned ways to use a node, it was possible to learn other ways. For example, one could learn to sense the presence of a node without actively looking for it, one could make the use of [[metamagic]] less costly in regard to magical energy while within a node, one could increase the number of spells allotted to one by using the node as one's mind to store spells, and one could draw increasingly more defensive power against physical attacks depending on the strength of the node, which became lower as one went closer to the edge of the node. Every type of node provided similar results, but the necessary skills to harness an earth node for example and the one necessary to harness an evil node were so different that the skills needed to be learned separately."
