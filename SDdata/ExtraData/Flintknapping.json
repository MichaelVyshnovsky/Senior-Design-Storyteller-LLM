        "mainbody": "Flintknapping''' was a skill and craft used by the [[Azuposi]] people of the [[Pasocada Basin]] of [[Maztica]].",
        "Description": "Flintknapping was similar to [[obsidian]] working, but specifically for flint. Flint was easier to work with when compared to obsidian. The Azuposi used flint to create sharpened heads for [[arrow]]s, [[spear]]s, [[dagger]]s, and even [[axe]]s. Someone with experience could produce arrowheads at the rate of 1–4 per hour, spearheads at a rate of 1–4 per day, and a single dagger or axehead per day."
