        "mainbody": "'''Heresy of the Threefold God''' was a belief during the [[Spellplague]] that [[Helm]], [[Tyr]], and [[Torm]] were the same god. The [[Eye of Justice]] was the only known organization that held this belief.",
        "Description": "The Threefold God presented Torm the True as the divine holder of guardianship, justice and loyalty from a [[lawful neutral]] alignment. This belief spread from [[Westgate]] to across the [[Sword Coast]] and the rest of [[Faer√ªn]]. This belief also influenced its believers to build religious temples that housed chapels to Torm, Tyr and Helm. The misunderstood belief was further sublimated when Torm provided divine power to some [[paladin]] Threefold God believers during the Spellplague.",
        "History": {
            "Spellplague": "{{Main|Spellplague}}\nIn {{YearlinkName|1384}}, [[Gedrin Shadowbane|Gedrin \"Shadowbane\" Thalavar]] who held [[Ever Watchful|Helm's lost weapon]] had a vision in which Helm was slain by Tyr and Helm's godhood merged with Tyr's. Later, Gedrin had another vision in which Tyr was killed by [[Orcus]] after which Tyr's essence merged with Torm's, creating the Threefold God. Another believer was [[Kalen Dren]], his successor and former human child [[rogue]]. As a religious zealot, Gedrin founded the [[Eye of Justice]] from crusaders within his former organization, the [[Night Masks]], but later left it in [[1391 DR]] due to its corruption. Later in the early 1460s DR, he met eight-year old Kalen in [[Luskan]].\n\nThe reality was the Threefold God did not exist, but it was a misunderstood status drawn from a limited educated mortal upon seeing the displaying of the foolish deaths acted upon by Helm and Tyr, with Torm as the neutral temporary benefactor. The belief spread by Gedrin and his Shadowbane persona kept Hermites from forgetting their god and preserving their church by the late 15<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]].",
