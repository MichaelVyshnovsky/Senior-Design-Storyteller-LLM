"'''Noble eladrin'''" was a term used, specifically between the [[Spellplague]] and the [[Second Sundering]], to refer to a subcategory of [[eladrin]] of particularly powerful magic or nobility. The phrase did not have a precise meaning and included a wide variety of races and individuals.{{Cite web/The one and only Ask the Realms designers thread 4/Eladrin definition}}

Some noble eladrin were [[high elves]] living in the [[Feywild]] who had become so infused with the power of that place as to become entirely new creatures, taking on aspects of the seasons and other natural phenomena.

==Races==

; [[Celestial eladrin]] : These were eladrin living in [[Arvandor]] and the [[Gates of the Moon]].
; [[Fey eladrin]] : [[Elves]] who made the Feywild their homes, so heavily modified by its magic that they acquired supernatural abilities not found in other elves, effectively becoming [[fey]] capable of changing their appearance with the seasons.
; [[LeShay]] : Thought to be the eladrin [[creator race]],{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal}} these albino fey were also among the noble eladrin.
; [[Archfey]] : Not technically a race, these were individual fey of comparative strength to [[demon prince]]s or [[archdevil]]s. Archfey who were eladrin were considered noble eladrin.

==Noble Eladrin Titles==
Nobility among eladrin was not a matter of inheritance but rather fame and mystical power. In some eladrin lands, specific titles, such as "coure", "bralani", and "ghaele", were given to eladrin of great power over particular spheres, or "winter". The title of "shiere knight" was given to noble eladrin who dedicated themselves to defending the Feywild from its foes. Other eladrin—often shiere knights—specifically guarded [[Tiandra]], the Summer Queen, and were known as "shiradi champions". These ''titles'' should not be confused with the [[celestial]] ''races'' of [[coure]], [[ghaele]], [[bralani]], [[shiere]], or [[shiradi]], although the names, no doubt, were related.

==Notable Individuals==

* High Lady [[Ordalf]] of [[Sarifal]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]]
* [[Malyanna]], a follower of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. She tried to open a portal to the [[Far Realm]] in [[1396 DR]].

==History==
In the [[1375 DR|Year of Risen Elfkin, 1375 DR]], High Lady Ordalf moved the entire fey city of [[Karador]] through a ''[[portal]]'' from the Feywild to [[Lake Myrloch]] on the island of [[Gwynneth]]. She took over the island from [[Kendrick|House Kendrick]] and established herself as ruler of the kingdom of Sarifal, banning all [[human]]s from the island. The island became a home for some 50,000 fey beings, many of whom were noble eladrin.
