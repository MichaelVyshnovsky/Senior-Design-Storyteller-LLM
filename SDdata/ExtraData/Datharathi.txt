The '''Datharathi''' chaka was a merchant family from [[Vaelan]], in [[Durpar]]. They became de-facto rulers of the city by {{yearlink|1479}}.

==History==
Before the creation of plangents, Datharathi minerals was one of the eleven most influential families in Durpar; besides mining, they controlled several shipbuilding docks.{{cite book/Darkvision||7}}

In {{yearlink|1367}}, [[Warian Datharathi]] lost an arm to an accident. His grandfather, the wizard [[Shaddon Datharathi]], used a recently discovered crystal to build him a prosthetic; though it could move, it was numb, and it was both weak and slow.{{cite book/Darkvision|3}} This prosthetic would also serve as the first [[plangent]] prototype.

In the years after Warian decided to travel the world in {{yearlink|1369}}, plangent limbs became fashionable in Vaelan, and the family business came to include the construction and application of highly expensive plangent limbs, both in order to overcome disabilities or to improve existing capabilities in healthy people. the death of the inventor of plangents, patriarch [[Shaddon Datharathi]],{{cite book/Darkvision|30}} on [[Tarsakh 19]] of {{yearlink|1374}} during the resealing of the Elder Evil causing the sudden death of all the plangents amongst their senior members,{{cite book/Darkvision|31}} the Datharathi's plangent art was known throughout the continent by {{yearlink|1383}}.

The Datharathi, somewhere in the next century, would propose an alliance with the [[Iron Eye]] [[goblin]]s from the [[Curna Mountains]]. Despite the [[Adama]], several families broke the agreement with the goblins; the Datharathi managed to come out on top of the ensuing [[Merchant Wars]]. They imposed a tax on trade with [[Delzimmer]], [[Estagund]], and [[Deep Imaskar]] for the other chakas, and raised a standing army, including goblins, [[hobgoblins]], and [[bugbears]] integrated during the war.
