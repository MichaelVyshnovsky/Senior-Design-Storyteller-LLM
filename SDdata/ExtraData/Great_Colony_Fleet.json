        "mainbody": "'''Great Colony Fleet''' was a massive fleet of ships organized by the [[Shoon Imperium]] in the {{YearlinkName|370}}, during the time of Qysara [[Shaani]]. It initially set out from [[Calimport]] with 600 ships and was intended to colonize the unsuspecting [[Moonshae Isles]], but was suddenly set upon by an unseasonable storm that wrecked most of the fleet and blew the remainder far westwards into the [[Trackless Sea]]. Unbeknownst to the world at large, the ships drifted for twenty days across the ocean, and the remaining twenty vessels finally made landfall with the surviving crew on the shores of far [[Lopango]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|27}}\n\nThough the disaster was hardly her fault, the loss of the fleet was still one more point of failure during Qysara Shaani's reign that marked the decline and doom of the Shoon Imperium. Due to the destructive end of the Imperium and the long ages that followed, the true facts of the Great Colony Fleet were barely known even among the wisest scholars of later ages."
