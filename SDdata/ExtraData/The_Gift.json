        "Inception": "The term came from the belief it was granted by the gods of [[Toril]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-02-06 - Divine Gifts}} While most priests preached the Gift came from the gods, divine action seldom bestowed the Gift permanently.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-02-13 - The Art Means Arcane Magic}}\n\nIt was possible to breed a population for higher likelihood of the Gift, and people with mages in their ascendance were more likely to display it, but even Mystra and [[Azuth]] working in concert did not have the power to make it a sure thing.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-07-02/Wizard breeding programs}} [[Sorcerer]]s, in particular, were often considered to have draconic ancestors. Other processes were considered liable to add to the possibilities of an individual being born Gifted; those included inserting dweomer-bearing objects into the mother's body beforehand, or the parents wearing [[enchanted]] underwear prior to conception, or having [[spell]]s cast on the gestating mother frequently. None of them was assured of working.{{cite web/theedverse/2019/03-05 - Spellscar inheritability}}\n\nNotably, the Gift wasn't equal for everyone, and some magicians bore greater innate power and affinity than others.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-05-19 - On Arcane Healing}}",
        "Awakening": "Of those who had the Gift, only around a third displayed it from birth, while the majority would see it awaken at some point in their lives.{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-02-06 - The Gift Across Life}} Those who were affected by spells, or handled [[magical item]]s, were more likely to awaken their Gift.{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-03-28 - Methods of granting the Gift}} Practicing magic constantly also made that one more likely,{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-09-18 - Practice awakening the Gift}} though it had only been the path for a rare few.{{cite web/theedverse/2024-09-18 - Rare study Gift awakeninga}}\n\nIt was believed the Gift could not be stolen; however, magical ability was in fact known to have been gained only at another's expense on a number of occasions.{{cite book/Castle Spulzeer}} On the occasions when people realized powers they did not have before, such events were widely understood as an awakening of a latent Gift rather than a newly created Gift.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-10-22 - Stealing and Awakening the Gift}} Only more extreme methods, such as replacing much of one's blood with that of a creature to which the Gift was inherent, such as a [[dragon]], were regarded as instilling a Gift where one wasn't present.{{Cite web/theedverse/2024-02-07 - Awakening the Gift}}\n\nA latent gift sometimes manifested, for those sufficiently studied and practiced in the Weave, in a dim ability to feel the ebb and flow of magic when in dreams. The Gift was also necessary for attuning to certain spell-unleashing devices, or perhaps to all enchanted miscellanea.{{cite web/theedverse/2024-08-18 - Giftless and Magic Items}}",
        "Testing": "Temples usually tested for the Gift by casting an [[orison]], while wizards taught a prospective Gifted the workings of a minor, safe, and simple [[cantrip]] and observing the results.",
        "Use in Magic": "In its most extreme formulation, sages spoke of the Gift as the ability to call on the Weave, and it was seen as necessary to employ any arcane magic at all,{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-05-19 - Wizards VS Clerics}} but it referred also to the ability to manipulate divine energy, and in fact some other abilities, with sufficient deftness to devise new spells and manage them appropriately. In such a view, a [[cleric]] or [[druid]] without the Gift would not be in control of their own spells available, nor would they be able to research novel magics, while a [[warlock]] would be similarly limited in spells to only those their patron actively provided.{{Cite_archive/Greenwood's_Grotto/2023-07-28/Giftless magic learners}} While all wizards wielded the Gift by definition, those from beyond Toril who operated methods not tuned to call on the Weave were not guaranteed that all their spells would behave exactly the same.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-01-07 - Otherworldly Wizardry}}\n\nThose with the Gift who would go on to wield magic would most likely train to become wizards.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-10-21 - Becoming a Wizard}} One of the important skills of wizardry, the threefold task of visualizing the specific effects and the symbology inherent to the [[somatic component]]s, which was part of casting a spell, could be learned and used to at least activate items that themselves provided a connection to the Weave, even if one did not have such a connection on their own.",
        "Other Effects": "People without the Gift wouldn't be able to comprehend the sense of magical words chosen for an incantation, while those with the Gift would intuitively understand the sense and purpose of the words in the spell, even if they were not familiar with the languages selected by the spellcraftsman.{{cite web/Questions for Ed Greenwood/2008/10-27 - Spell Notation}} The Gift also allowed \"voices in the Weave\" to speak to its bearers.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-11-21 - Shandril as a Voice}} Some people had \"[[innate talent]]s\" alongside their Gift or as its entirety, the ability to cast certain spells or use other effects without the need for any practice.{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/How Magic Works}}",
        "Frequency": "[[File:Netherese baking.png|thumb|right|300px|''In ancient Netheril, basic magical aptitude was standard.'']]\nThe amount of people who had the Gift varied, but they were rare; in the Sword Coast during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the reported ratio of people with the Gift was about 1 in 9,000, and not even half of them would ever develop it.{{cite web/theedverse/2020/12-30 - Arcane Demographics}} In contrasting, in some extensively magical races, such as [[elves]], [[triton]]s, or [[tiefling]]s, the Gift was held by a majority of their members.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-01-23 - Rarity of demihuman wizards}} Later numbers, taking into account numerous magical catastrophes, put the numbers of the Gifted somewhere under six percent of the populace.{{cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2024-08-09/The Gift Population Ratio}}\n\nIn ancient [[Netheril]], almost every member of [[human]] society was able and expected to wield at least a few basic [[cantra]]s. This carried through to the descendants of Netheril; the [[Shadovar]] of [[Thultanthar]] also had a widespread basic affinity with arcane magic, with even common soldiers having at least some ability. [[Halruaa]], too, showed an extremely high frequency of arcanists; about one-third of them were said to cast at least one spell as of {{yearlink|1367}}, a number that held in {{yearlink|1372}}.{{cite book/Shining South|129}}",
        "In Society": "Some societies actively tested children for the Gift, including [[Thay]]. Every citizen of Thay was tested in their infancy.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-07-04 - Non-human Red Wizards}}{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-10-06/Non-humans in Thay}}\n\nThe [[Harpers]] sought out those with the Gift, especially those who might be interested in joining.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-11-02 - Harpers seeking Wizards}}\n\nAmongst [[ixzan]]s, the demonrays of the Underdark, wizard ixzans had an intuitive sense for magical ability in young ixzan. On identifying one, they would defend the nascent spellcaster ferociously against others in their cruel society.<ref>",
        "Notable or Assumed Giftless": "* [[Archlis]], a [[magelord]], was accused of having no magic of his own by the [[genasi]] [[wizard]] [[Gunderal]], claiming all he had were \"stolen charms and looted trinkets.\" Whether it was true or not, the insult appeared to hit home for him.\n* The [[Yhaunn]]ian scion [[Keph Thingoleir]] was not able to learn or cast any arcane magic, despite all his siblings and his parents being capable of wizardry.{{Cite web/Character Profile: At Home in Fourstaves House}} Instead, he had a powerful affinity for [[the Power]].\n* The [[Cormyte]] nobleman [[Sardasper Halaunt]], despite all his ambitions, was never able to master any magic to the day he died.{{cite book/Spellstorm||13}}",
        "Giftless Magic": "A few methods of magic, such as [[table magic]], didn't require the Gift.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-02-13 - Table Magic}} As the Gift was a connection to the Weave,{{cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/07-10 - Incarnum and Truespeak}} and [[pluma]].{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/09-27 - Consequences of Weave Failure}}\n\nFor those without the Gift, some powerful magic items (mostly artifacts) could provide a pathway to working magic.",
