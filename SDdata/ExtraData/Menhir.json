These menhirs all bore inscriptions that were carved in their ancient Elven dialect. Over time the power of these menhirs faded and they became buried within the undergrowth of Yuirwood, overgrown with grass or moss. Those that retained their old magic glowed unearthly colors under the light of the full moon. Some became used as meeting places by fey creatures, such as pixies and sprites.\nThe menhir circles that remained known of within the Yuirwood formed a portal network that the Masters of the Yuirwood, an elite group of half-elven druids and rangers, used to rapidly move across the woods to respond to any growing threats. Beyond the forest, they could even travel to the realm of Sildëyuir.\nIn 1359 DR, Zembrath Klun discovered a menhir on Mezeketh Isle that was inscribed in an ancient Jhaamdathan script.\nDuring the Spellplague, many of the menhir circles of Yuirwood seemed to attract active pockets of the eponymous plague.\nIn 1479 DR,The date for all Year 1 RPGA sanctioned adventures is considered to be 1479 DR for the purposes of this wiki. the Festering Wound tribe conducted a mining operation within the Tannath Mountains on behalf of a mage known as the Saffron Devil, harvesting within its depths the same menhir stones that were once used by the Yuir folk. They attached the mined stones to sledges, which they then had pulled by giant ants.\nthumb|One of the menhirs from the Coast Way forest.\n* A menhir stood just outside the city of Relkaths Foot.\n* Temples of Callarduran Smoothhands customarily had a solitary menhir as their central altar.
