        "History": "In ancient times, the [[Yuir]] folk of [[Aglarond]] used menhir stones that were infused with crystals{{Cite organized play/LFR/Silver Lining|17}} to create monumental circles that they performed mystical ceremonies in and used as ''portals''. These menhirs all bore inscriptions that were carved in their ancient [[Elven]] dialect. Over time the power of these menhirs faded and they became buried within the undergrowth of [[Yuirwood]], overgrown with [[grass]] or [[moss]]. Those that retained their old magic glowed unearthly colors under the light of the [[Selûne (moon)|full moon]]. Some became used as meeting places by [[fey]] creatures, such as [[pixie]]s and [[Sprite (creature)|sprites]].\n\nThe menhir circles that remained known of within the Yuirwood formed a ''portal'' network that the [[Masters of the Yuirwood]], an elite group of [[half-elven]] [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s, used to rapidly move across the woods to respond to any growing threats. Beyond the forest, they could even travel to the realm of [[Sildëyuir]].\n\nIn [[1359 DR]], [[Zembrath Klun]] discovered a menhir on [[Mezeketh Isle]] that was inscribed in an ancient [[Jhaamdathan language|Jhaamdathan script]].\n\nDuring the [[Spellplague]], many of the menhir circles of Yuirwood seemed to attract active pockets of the eponymous plague.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]],<ref group=\"note\">The date for all Year 1 RPGA sanctioned adventures is considered to be [[1479 DR]] for the purposes of this wiki. the [[Festering Wound tribe]] conducted a mining operation within the [[Tannath Mountains]] on behalf of a [[mage]] known as the [[Saffron Devil]], harvesting within its depths the same menhir stones that were once used by the Yuir folk.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Silver Lining|12}} They attached the mined stones to [[sledge]]s, which they then had pulled by [[giant ant]]s.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Silver Lining|22}}",
