The '''Finnish pantheon''' was a loose [[pantheon]] of small influence, whose deities were scattered across the [[Outer Planes]]. A number of these deities found worship on the [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]] worlds of [[Earth]] and [[Toril]].

==Description==
The members of this pantheon spent much of their time fighting against titanic creatures of darkness. Beyond this, many of the deities seemingly suffered from some form of apathy, caring very little about their brethren or their gradual descent towards vanishing away into the [[Astral Sea]], the state of a [[dead power]].

A number of sages across the [[plane]]s studied the Finnish pantheon with great interest due to this apathy, believing that its members were simply allowing themselves to fade away. The main exception to this were two younger members of the pantheon,<ref>

When it came to interacting with mortals, the Finnish deities were generally more detached than others, preferring to keep to themselves and only provide aid when it was most needed. Though the more powerful members of the pantheon were known for mingling with mortals or sending their agents out to do so.

==Notable Members==
* [[Kiputytto]], the [[demigod]]dess of disease.
* [[Loviatar]], the Finnish goddess of pain and torture.
* [[Mielikki]], the Finnish goddess of nature.
* [[Untamo]], the Finnish god of sleep and dreams.

==History==
The exact origins of the Finnish pantheon were a mystery, even to the deities within it. Legends claimed that some of them arose from the status of [[primal spirit]], while others had just always existed.

===History on Toril===
Sometime around [[-4370 DR]], a devastating plague occurred on [[Toril]] in the land of [[Raurin]], ravaging the ruling [[Imaskar Empire]]. Four years later,<ref> the [[mage]]s of the Imaskar Empire sought to revitalize their population by opening two great ''[[gate]]s'' to [[Earth|another world]], then kidnapping from it numerous humans to serve as their slaves.<ref> Eventually their empire would crumble in [[-2488 DR]],<ref> but survivor states would emerge in its wake, such as the kingdom of [[Bakar]].<ref> The people of this kingdom built a mighty city, [[Medinat Muskawoon]], that housed temples to the gods of their ancestors' original world. Among them was a temple to the Finnish god Untamo.

Many years later, the goddess Kiputytto established herself on Toril. There she came to blows with another goddess of disease by the name of [[Talona]]. The two competed to see who was superior and ultimately Talona came out on top, slaying Kiputytto after her loss.

Eventually, the Finnish goddesses Mielikki and Loviatar came to follow the lead of [[Tyr]], the [[Norse pantheon|Norse deity]] of justice, in that they sent [[priest]]s to the world of Toril in [[Realmspace]] to gain more worshipers and establish themselves as members of the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon]]. Some speculated that it was likely Mielikki who made the decision first and that Loviatar chased after her. Others further speculated that, with the greater power offered to them by their worshipers in Realmspace, they might one day leave the Finnish pantheon altogether.

Mielikki spent many of the following years living in the forests of Toril. But following a catastrophic event in Realmspace known as the [[Time of Troubles]], Mielikki decided to establish a proper [[divine realm]] within the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]].
