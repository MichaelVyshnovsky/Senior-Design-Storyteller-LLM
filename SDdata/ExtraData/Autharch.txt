An autharch was a lesser, local bureaucrat within the hierarchy Thay. They were often appointed as mayors, governors, magistrates or other local leaders who served at the discretion of the regional governors known as tharchions.
These lesser officers were seen as highly-replaceable. Those who proved to be incompetent in their work were readily dispatched. Any autharchs who proved themselves adroit were typically eliminated by their superiors for fear of being supplanted.
