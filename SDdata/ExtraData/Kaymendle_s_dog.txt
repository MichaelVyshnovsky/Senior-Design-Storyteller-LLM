'''Kaymendle's dog'''The apparition is never referred to as Kaymendle's dog. This name is chosen by similarity with the pattern for [[Kaymendle bolt]]s, but as there is only one, it is referred to as Kaymendle's dog, rather than a Kaymendle dog. was an apparition created by [[Kaymendle Skrip]], extant in [[Harrowdale]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It reacted to clouds, predicting rain.{{cite book/Elminster's Ecologies/The Settled Lands|10}}

==Description==
The apparition resembled a fat war dog made of cloudstuff.

==Behaviour==
The dog mostly responded to incoming rain; it whined hours before light rain came, barked when typical summer rain clouds were approaching, and howled in advance of heavy rain.

==History==
Kaymendle Skrip created Kaymendle's dog for the farmers of southern [[Harrowdale]], expecting its barking would scare away storm clouds. It failed at that task, as the clouds ignored the dog. However, it remained until at least the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], when it was still visible over southern [[Harrowdale]].
