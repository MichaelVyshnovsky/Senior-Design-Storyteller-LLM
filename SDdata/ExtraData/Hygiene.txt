The concept of hygiene was known in the Realms. However, it varied culturally, geographically and was practiced differently by different races. The importance of cleanliness in medicine was also known, and healers disinfected the wounds the best way they could to promote natural recovery.
Personal hygiene, for the most part, was lacking. Bad breath and deficient teeth hygiene were very common. Individuals who did not get a chance to regularly bathe used heavily scented oils to mask the unpleasant body and hair odor. Individuals with bad hygiene, for the Realms, washed their hair once every four days and scrubbed "smelly areas" every evening or so.
A typical inn offered its guests a bath, in some places even assisted by good-looking lasses or lads, which was the usual way of keeping themselves clean among travelers, merchants, and adventurers. At the Rising Raven Inn, a room with a bathtub, made of copper, was filled with hot water, heated up, and carried there by servants or footboys. Some bigger inns, like the Waukeens Rest, had big bathing areas, filled with hot water wooden tubs, fresh clean towels and chamomile-scented soaps. Festhalls often offered more of recreations bathing, one such establishment was the Blushing Mermaid. The Mermaids baths were filled with scented sparkling waters that were magically purified.
