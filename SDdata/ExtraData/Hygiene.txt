The concept of '''hygiene''' was known in the Realms. However, it varied culturally, geographically and was practiced differently by different races. The importance of cleanliness in medicine was also known, and healers disinfected the wounds the best way they could to promote natural recovery.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171021205332/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/so_saith_ed-Part-01.zip| title = So Saith Ed - Part 1 (Feb-Apr 2004)| accessdate = 02-09-2021| date = 02-09-2021}}

Personal hygiene, for the most part, was lacking. Bad breath and deficient teeth hygiene were very common. Individuals who did not get a chance to regularly bathe used heavily scented [[oil]]s to mask the unpleasant body and hair odor. Individuals with bad hygiene, for the Realms, washed their hair once every four days and scrubbed "smelly areas" every evening or so.

A typical inn offered its guests a bath, in some places even assisted by good-looking lasses or lads, which was the usual way of keeping themselves clean among travelers, merchants, and adventurers. At the [[Rising Raven Inn]], a room with a bathtub, made of [[copper]], was filled with hot water, heated up, and carried there by servants or footboys. Some bigger inns, like the [[Waukeen's Rest]], had big bathing areas, filled with hot water wooden tubs, fresh clean towels and [[chamomile]]-scented [[soap]]s. Festhalls often offered more of recreations bathing, one such establishment was the [[Blushing Mermaid (Waterdeep)|Blushing Mermaid]]. The Mermaid's baths were filled with scented sparkling waters that were magically purified.

*[[Ardanthe (plant)|Ardanthe]] was an aromatic plant that secreted sap that could be rubbed on hair to imbue it with a pleasant herbal scent, used by rangers in the wild.
*[[Scentwater]] was water mixed with [[perfume]]s and used for bathing purposes in [[The Vast]].
*[[Soap]] was the most common cleaning substance available in virtually all civilized places, even though it was sometimes hard to find. It was used to remove dirt and smell from skin, clothing, adventuring gear, and hair. Typical soap was concocted using [[tree]] oils and sometimes scented.
*[[Waterfall Kiss]] was a type of scented face wash.{{Cite web/Waterdeep News/New Scent Makes Faces Glow}}

==Hygiene in the Field==

*[[Ranger]]s knew the value of personal hygiene when away from civilization. Body odor tended to attract hungry wild beasts and [[stingflies]]. The latter were a distracting nuisance, while the former could easily track ripe sweaty humanoid stench from great distances. Rangers used cold mountain and forest streams to wash themselves and scrubbed their bodies with sand from the stream bottom.
*Hygiene was lacking for sailors and passengers of naval vessels, especially those bound to travel between continents. Ships lacked space and resources to offer baths, so passengers tended to smell and were in need of good scrubbing and personal grooming as they reached their final destinations.
*Cleanup after one's [[nightsoil]] egestion varied depending on one's class and availability of methods. Some used hand-scoop method, travelers could use sand along a river bank, others "skidded their bum along in the snow," the wealthy were known to use scented [[thareea]] wipe cloths, as well as tough leaves of the [[thallow]] and [[yahllavur-fern]] plants.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240405041010/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_010203-06.htm| title = So Saith Ed Jan â€“ Mar 2006| accessdate = 5-4-2024| date = 23-1-2006}}

*The City of Splendors, Waterdeep, was known for its ever-popular public heated [[salt]]water baths. These establishments could be identified by lists steam floating out of ajar doors and windows.
*In the ancient kingdom of [[Bakar]], the city of [[Medinat Muskawoon]] had a great deal of public bath houses. When the city fell into ruin only three of them survived into the [[Present Age]], the [[Baths of Persepolis]], [[Baths of Drusus]], and [[Baths of Kordek]].<ref> Of these, the Baths of Kordek were notably the only one to allow women on the premises in a segregated space and were built atop a [[sulfur]]ous spring that made the baths a popular recreational spot for affluent caravan owners.<ref>
*In the [[Blade Kingdoms]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]], nobility believed in humors theory. Bathing was unwelcome as it introduced "rude humors into the blood-stream," which was frowned upon.
* On [[Dragonisle]], the city of [[Immurk's Hold]] had numerous bath houses for the resident pirates to bathe in.{{Cite dungeon/66/Operation Manta Ray|45}}
* In the [[Shining Plains]] region of the Vilhon Reach, communal bath houses could be found in every city with separate areas for men and women, typically built atop a hot spring. The people of this region considered bathing an important social activity and thus viewed with suspicion those who refused to engage in it or built themselves a private bath.
*[[Chult]]an port city - [[Port Nyanzaru]], was considered an extremely clean town by the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The [[human]]s of the city dated daily and were horrified of the idea of skipping daily bath. The city was littered with public and private bathhouses ran by the [[Church of Sune]]. These bathhouses were free, but the visitors were encouraged to leave a donation to the Church.
*In the [[Great Dale]] port village of [[Uthmere]], prior to immersing themselves in a bath, people typically covered their bodies with "tainted oil". These were vegetable oils in recycled flasks, costing a few coppers, and the oil would be scraped off with wooden "knives" and paddles. Those too poor to afford such scraping implements would instead dress up in thick robes and old boots, articles of clothing they used solely for this activity, and go down into the river (except in the coldest winter weather). The washing of hair was done in a [[taerath]] holding water scented with crushed [[mint]] or perfumes. In most households, this was done in the same basin used to fillet fish, clean babies, and wash clothing. Warm bathing water was considered a luxury in the village.{{Cite web/Realmslore/Uthmere (Part Three): Daily and Nightly Life in Uthmere}}
*During the [[History of the Crusade|Crusade Against the Tuigan]], the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan|Grand Army]] under [[Yamun Khahan]] had terrible hygiene due to rough nomadic lifestyle and endless track and war against [[Cormyr]] and [[Shou Lung]]. Their tents and clothes were infested with [[lice]] and other vermin. Baths were a rare luxury and were unpleasant cold melted snow. The Tuigan troops, however, did not seem to show much discomfort from the parasites.
* In [[Kara-Tur]], hot springs of the [[Mount Matazan]] possessed invigorating properties, and many of the mountain's bathhouses were recommended by [[Wa]] physicians as a remedy for those sickly and week.
* In the water-limited land of [[Zakhara]] the bathhouse, known in [[Midani]] as ''hammam'', was a profitable enterprise and gathering place for both men and women. However, hammamm had separate usage times proscribed for each [[gender and sex|sex]].<ref>

==Hygiene Among Various Races==
*[[Ettin]]s were dimwitted [[giant-kin]] who valued filth and dirt and feared cleanliness.
*[[Gnoll]]s were known to be [[flea]] and lice-ridden. They often lived in sloven squalor and their lairs were infested with the same parasites.
*[[Goblin]]s of [[Grodd]] used [[fungus]] with similar properties of tree oils to create soaps, detergents, scented perfumes and aromatics.
*[[Janni]] in the land of Zakhara often had a bathhouse in their permanent settlements, with quarters for any visiting [[marid]]s.<ref>
*[[Nomadic centaur]]s loathed bathing and were known for extreme poor hygiene.
*[[Ogre]]s and [[half-ogre]]s had notoriously low standards of personal hygiene. Standing downwind from them was deadly, almost as deadly as their foul breath.
