A miscellaneous manifestation fell into the latter category.\nAs \"miscellaneous\" manifestation suggested, the term was a catch-all term for manifestations that did not fall in other categories. These smells, sounds, auras, and even possessions but also unique manifestations of a deity.\nMiscellaneous manifestations were used by deities used to convey information, but due to their often-vague nature and reliance on interpretation, they were sometimes misunderstood.\nWhen a follower received a unique miscellaneous manifestation, their standing among other followers of his or her faith might improve. In fact, there was a high chance for that.\nCategoryMagic\n95qwzg3zywhub9drjykv3gitimmezsb"
