They responded to magic by thoroughly healing those within.\nEach refuge was most likely a spherical dome  across. They had no power to block entry, but any spell cast within, or enchanted object broken, or even breaking an object that was under the effects of a spell, triggered an effect upon the user. This effect could heal any hurts, purged feeblemind, geas, charm, fear, curses, and most other spell-borne alterations. They also provided warmth and coolness to the being inside, provided no other beings inside sought a different temperature. Being completely inside the refuge was not necessary to trigger its beneficial effects simply intersecting its edge sufficed.\nMaldiglas Turntowers project as the Magister was the creation of those refuges, which he began almost immediately upon gaining the mantle. He continued to create such refuges until his lifeforce drained completely.\nAfter his death, a clay ball was broken at every magefair since, with a message inside each ball revealing the location of each such refuge. There was also a promise of retribution from Mystra if someone were to attempt to entrap, enclose, alter, or destroy such a refuge. Sources indicated the wrath of Mystra would also extend to those hurling dangerous spells into a refuge.\n* Easting There was a refuge in a little hollow flanked by duskwood trees at the north end of a knoll covered in shrubs, south of town, off a caravan road between two marshes that turned into shallow ponds in the wet season.\n* Elmwood Just west of the settled area, in the deep woods west of a pool known as Deepstar, there was a refuge between a felsul that split in three at ground level and the stump of a long-falled shadowtop.\n* Eshpurta A refuge lay west of a cluster of brambleberry bushes, itself west off the westernmost gate at the eastern end of the southernmost east-west ridges south of the settled area.\n* Nashkel South of the settled area there was a refuge between the Staring Ranger rock and the three black boulders known as the Eggs of the Dragon.\n* Neverwinter In Eldaths Patch.\n* Saerb Half a mile northwest by way of the Drunkards Walk.\n* Silverymoon On the roof of the aviary due east of Mielikkis Glade.\n* Soubar East of Drunsters Well.\n* Starmantle In a triangular depression northwest of the settled area, in a little cleft on the shore leading to a  drop.\n* Suzail In the cleared center of a planting of juniper bushes parallel to Lake Azoun, northwest of Vangerdahasts Tower.\n* Tilverton Between two blue boulders, west of the Dragonbones.\n* Trailstone The southwestern end of a haunted burial mound southwest of the settled area held a refuge in its downslope.\n* Waterdeep In a cave within Mount Waterdeep, accessible through fourteen different gates spread across the city.\n3r2gmhkto14m4p4k3ab353c94my7iv5"
