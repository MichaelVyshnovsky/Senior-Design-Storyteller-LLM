They responded to magic by thoroughly healing those within.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|73-76}}\n\n{{quote|''All of us need a hidden, private place, a little refuge all our own where we can shut out the cares of the world for a while. It's why we build play-huts when we're young and love-nests when we're old- but those can be lost forever if the love fails. Those of us wise enough or lucky enough to have such a place as we grow older will keep our wits longer and laugh more than others.''|Excerpt from ''[[Words to an Apprentice: My Tutelage Under Great Mages|Words to an Apprentice]]'' quoting Lady Mage [[Laeral Silverhand]].}}",
        "Use": "Each refuge was most likely a spherical dome {{SI|40|feet|long=yes}} across. They had no power to block entry, but any spell cast within, or [[enchanted]] object broken, or even breaking an object that was under the effects of a spell, triggered an effect upon the user. This effect could ''[[heal]]'' any hurts, purged ''[[feeblemind]]'', ''[[geas]]'', ''[[charm monster|charm]]'', ''[[fear]]'', curses, and most other spell-borne alterations. They also provided warmth and coolness to the being inside, provided no other beings inside sought a different temperature. Being completely inside the refuge was not necessary to trigger its beneficial effects; simply intersecting its edge sufficed.",
        "History": "Maldiglas Turntower's project as the [[Magister]] was the creation of those refuges, which he began almost immediately upon gaining the mantle. He continued to create such refuges until his lifeforce drained completely.\n\nAfter his death, a clay ball was broken at every [[magefair]] since, with a message inside each ball revealing the location of each such refuge. There was also a promise of retribution from [[Mystra]] if someone were to attempt to entrap, enclose, alter, or destroy such a refuge. Sources indicated the wrath of Mystra would also extend to those hurling dangerous spells into a refuge.",
        "Locations": "* [[Easting]]: There was a refuge in a little hollow flanked by [[duskwood]] trees at the north end of a knoll covered in shrubs, south of town, off a caravan road between two marshes that turned into shallow ponds in the wet season.\n* [[Elmwood]]: Just west of the settled area, in the deep woods west of a pool known as [[Deepstar]], there was a refuge between a [[felsul]] that split in three at ground level and the stump of a long-falled [[shadowtop]].\n* [[Eshpurta]]: A refuge lay west of a cluster of [[brambleberry (berry)|brambleberry]] bushes, itself west off the westernmost gate at the eastern end of the southernmost east-west ridges south of the settled area.\n* [[Nashkel]]: South of the settled area there was a refuge between the [[Staring Ranger]] rock and the three black boulders known as the [[Eggs of the Dragon]].\n* [[Neverwinter]]: In [[Eldath's Patch]].\n* [[Saerb]]: Half a mile northwest by way of the [[Drunkard's Walk]].\n* [[Silverymoon]]: On the roof of the aviary due east of [[Mielikki's Glade]].\n* [[Soubar]]: East of [[Drunster's Well]].\n* [[Starmantle]]: In a triangular depression northwest of the settled area, in a little cleft on the shore leading to a {{SI|40|feet|long=yes}} drop.\n* [[Suzail]]: In the cleared center of a planting of [[juniper]] bushes parallel to [[Lake Azoun]], northwest of [[Vangerdahast's Tower]].\n* [[Tilverton]]: Between two blue boulders, west of the [[Dragonbones]].\n* [[Trailstone]]: The southwestern end of a haunted burial mound southwest of the settled area held a refuge in its downslope.\n* [[Waterdeep]]: In a cave within [[Mount Waterdeep]], accessible through fourteen different gates spread across the city.",
