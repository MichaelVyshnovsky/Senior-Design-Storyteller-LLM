The Sandvoyagers Guild was a Durpari guild of desert guides operating in the Raurin. They guided caravans from Bralizzar to the lands north of the the desert, and back.
The Guild reopened the northwards trade from Durpar after the River Athis dried. They raised the Sandvoyagers Guideposts, a number of poles from which hung silvery bangles those bangles marked the Sandvoyagers Track, the path they took across the desert. The Sandvoyagers Guild had built a compound on the Oasis of the White Palm.
*Tolnus Granicus
As of , a slaver ring had captured the guildmaster, Tolnus Granicus. These slavers were also posing as members of the Guild in Bralizzar and in the Oasis of the White Palm, which allowed them to go on with their unsavory activities, such as looting the bodies of dead Airlancers. These slavers had drow allies, and made use of the Temple of Set directly beneath the Guildhall.
