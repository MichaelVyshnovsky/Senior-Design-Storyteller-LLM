        "mainbody": "'''Cormathan mantle''' was a variation of the ''[[mantle (spell)|mantle]]'' popular in [[Cormanthyr]].{{Cite dragon annual/1997/The magic of Myth Drannor|89}}",
        "Powers": "The Cormathan version of a mantle was an intangible object about the shoulders, but which was centered in a gem. The mantle could store [[spell]]s as attack, utility, or defensive ones; a defensive spell was always active, an attack spell could be used once daily, and an utility spell could be called upon up to thrice daily. These spells could be employed with an act of will, and did not require casting the spell, making them extremely flexible. However, any day in which the magic was called on, they spent a modest amount of lifeforce from their wearer.",
        "Creation": "The gem around which the mantle grew was to be steeped first in the caster's tears. Only the creator of a mantle could modify it, and with every additional spell put into the mantle, it significantly reduced their endurance in combat. The user could only add new spells into the mantle every time they reached new levels of proficiency with magic.\n\nA number of hidden spells had been devised to grant the mantle other powers.",
        "Known Users": "The [[Coronal]]'s mantle was unique in that it could call upon the power of his thrones, the [[Living Seat]] in the [[Isle of Estel]] and the [[Throne of the Coronal]] in the [[Chamber of the Court]], as well as the [[Vault of the Ages]] or other sources of power if they were nearby.\n\nOther known users were [[Cilivren Doedance]] and [[Nlaea]].",
        "Rumors & Legends": "The wizard [[Malchor Harpell]] was assumed to be capable of creating a mantle from scratch.\n\nThe late witch [[Nunntchlea]] of [[Secomber]] was said to have hidden a spellbook somewhere in [[Waterdeep]], and to have cast her own mantles ca. {{yearlink|1350}}."
