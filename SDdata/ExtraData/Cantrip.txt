"Cantrip" was the common name for the weakest spells an arcane spellcaster could cast. The divine magic equivalents were known as orisons, but "cantrip" was often used to describe all beginner apprentice/acolyte spells. Cantrips were the first spells that a wizard learned during their apprenticeship.
The effects that could be created were very minor, very brief, and mostly harmless, intended to entertain children or impress commoners,
