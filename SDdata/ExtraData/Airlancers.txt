The Airlancers were a Durpari force of pegasus cavalry. They protected Durpari settlements in Raurin.
The Sandvoyagers Guild were under the protection of the Airlancers. Amongst other tasks of the Airlancers were looking for lost caravans and keeping a lookout for enemies, including the servants of Khalitharius (as of ), and escorting any suspicious individuals to the local authorities. and were part of law enforcement in Bralizzar.
An army of airlancers looking for whoever had destroyed the Oasis of Akhir was destroyed by Khalitharius and his forces. The equipment of the defeated was looted by slavers posing as the Sandvoyagers Guild. One lone survivor may have held on to life just long enough to deliver a mithril disk and an account of the fact to the adventurers who released Khalitharius.
All airlancers rode pegasi, with which they could communicate in complex ways. Many, perhaps most, airlancers were drawn from the ranks of men with incredible strength.
