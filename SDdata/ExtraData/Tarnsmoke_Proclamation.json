This law and practice became very popular over the next decade, changing the public attitude of mistrust people usually had about bounty hunters in the 14 century DR.\nBy 1480 DR, the Tarnsmoke Proclamation was legal in most places along the Sword Coast, though hiring bounty hunters was something frowned upon by many faiths.\nCategoryLaws\nd5h32julaghvxtpyy2lqh6ug9s8wk1i"
