This article details the '''history of the [[Dalelands]]''', a land in [[north Faerûn]].

==Early History==
The early [[human]]s found within the [[Dalelands]] were known to be of [[Chondathan]] and [[Damaran]] descent, and settled in small hamlets and farmsteads around Cormanthor around {{Yearlink|-200}}.{{Cite dragon/188/Bazaar of the Bizarre: A set of special swords from the FORGOTTEN REALMS}} In contrast, the Great Forest was well defended by the renowned [[Elven]] empire of [[Cormanthyr]], and any significant forestry endeavors were hampered by the elves.

Nonetheless, a land wealthy in natural resources, with a burgeoning human population soon attracted more settlers of their kind. The Dalelands opened up to a swell of migrations from all over [[Faerûn]], but most notably the growing countries of Cormyr and Sembia. This new presence was judiciously considered by [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]]. To prevent what would surely be bloody war with a rapidly expanding new populace, he arranged for the elves and [[wizard]]s of the fledgling human society to come together in agreement.

==Origins==
; [[1 DR]]: The [[Standing Stone]] was erected by the human [[mage]]s, whose descendants would be called Dalesfolk, and the elves of Cormanthyr. This landmark served as symbol of unity between the two people, and their agreement known as the [[Dales Compact]]. The terms of is treaty were the humans would be allowed to settle in the unforested and non-elven-claimed regions of the forest of Cormanthor in return for not cutting deeper into the elven woodlands.

; [[220 DR]]: Coronal Eltagrim allowed humans to enter Cormanthyr for the first time.
