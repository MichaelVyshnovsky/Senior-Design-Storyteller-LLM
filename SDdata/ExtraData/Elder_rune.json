Many races and organizations had their own collections of signs and way-markers for such communication, but these were relatively secret and known primarily only to members of those groups. Elder runes, in contrast, had been in use for so long that all races used them, and even commoners from the [[Heartlands]] understood their meanings.\n\nMost of the elder runes had unique names by which the glyph was known."
