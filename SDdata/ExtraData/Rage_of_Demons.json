        "Description": "The [[Wizards of the Coast]] provided the following introduction to the Rage of Demons: \n{{Quote|''Following on the critically-acclaimed [[Tyranny of Dragons]] and [[Elemental Evil]] stories, Rage of [[Demon]]s will transport characters to the deadly and insane underworld. Rumors of powerful [[demon lord]]s such as [[Demogorgon]], [[Orcus]] and [[Graz'zt]] terrorizing the denizens of the [[Underdark]] have begun to filter up to the cities of the [[Sword Coast]]. The already dangerous caverns below the surface are thrown into ultimate chaos, madness and discord. The renegade [[drow]] [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] is sent to investigate but it will be up to you to aid in his fight against the demons before he succumbs to his darker temptations.''|Rage of Demons article\n{{cite web |url= http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/news/rageofdemons|title=Rage of Demons |date=2015-05-16 |accessdate=2015-09-22 |format= |work=Wizards.com}}}}\n\nThe storyline was also described this way: \n{{Quote|''The main storyline for Rage of Demons takes place in the vast subterranean world known as the Underdark. This dark landscape is a twisted labyrinth where fear reigns, and is home to horrific monsters that have never seen the light of day. It is here that the dark elf Gromph Baenre, Archmage of Menzoberranzan, performs a foul ritual meant to tap into the magical energy of Faerzress that suffuses the Underdark—and tears open portals to the demonic Abyss in the process. The creatures that step through those portals horrify even the archmage, and from that moment on, demonic insanity pervades the Underdark and threatens to shake the Forgotten Realms to its foundations. Adventurers must stop the madness before it consumes the Underdark and spreads to destroy the surface folk of Faerûn!.''|Adventurers League Player's Guide 3.0{{Cite document/Adventurers League Player's Guide 3.0|8}}}}\n\nA key part of the storyline was presented in ''[[Archmage (novel)|Archmage]]'': the appearance of demons in [[Menzoberranzan]] and elsewhere in the Underdark, which were summoned in [[1485 DR]] and [[1486 DR]] by [[Matron Mother]] [[Quenthel Baenre]] in order to secure her reign over the city. The presence of the demons was according to the plans of [[Lolth]], who arranged for [[Gromph Baenre]] to inadvertently summon [[Demogorgon]] to the [[Prime Material Plane]] in 1486 DR.",
