In such areas, a spell could backfire upon its caster, target the wrong location, be dramatically increased in power, or indeed, anything could occur. These areas were thought to have been caused by the titanic battles of the [[god]]s during the [[Time of Troubles]].<ref> Wild-magic zones were the first areas where [[raw magic]] burst forth in the [[Spellplague]].\n\nIf wild magic was accompanied by a green haze, worshipers of [[Erevan Ilesere]] saw this as a good omen.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|11}}",

However, for any spell a wild mage cast, there was the danger that they lost control over the raw power they utilized and released it in what was called a \"wild surge\": the freed magical energy either influenced and distorted the intended spell, or produced a totally unpredictable additional effect.<ref>"
