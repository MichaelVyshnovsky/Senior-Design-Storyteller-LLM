Also titled "Misty Fortunes and Absent Hearts", The Curse of Strahd storyline modules were primarily set in the Demiplane of Dread realm of Barovia, which are beyond the scope of this wiki, but also included some modules involving the re-taking of Phlan in the Moonsea region and several Faerûnian characters who had been transplanted to Barovia. It is thematically linked to Curse of Strahd.
