Around 1258 DR,Harlshoon died in 1258 DR according to p.28 of Ruins of Zhentil Keep (Campaign Book), so this date is based on this information. Manshoon requested the help of this family in order to avenge the death of Harlshoon, his father. This resulted in the destruction of a Toroth villa, although Manshoon was pulled from the rubble and saved by his soon-to-be apprentice Sememmon (known as Malatar Wingstarl at that time).\nCategoryZhentil Keep houses\nCategoryHuman houses\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations in Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Zhentil Keep\nCategoryNoble houses\nCategoryOrganizations on the Moonsea\nCategoryOrganizations in North Faerûn\nae2pxy1bhyajmx0wdbfw2oii19j5mh5"
