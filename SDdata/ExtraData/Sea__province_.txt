The '''province of sea''' in the [[Zakhara]]n view of [[magic]] was a group of spells related to the element of [[water]]. Dominated by deserts as the Land of Fate was, the magical province took its name from the one place where water was abundant: the seas surrounding the continent, so important for trade and travel.<ref><ref> Many of its spells were related to sea-faring.<ref>

The four elemental provinces played a very similar role for Zakharan magic-users as the eight (or nine) [[schools of magic]] did for [[Faer√ªn]]ian ones.

==History==
Zakharan sages speculated that the province of sea was developed in the [[Corsair Domains]].

==Practitioners==
[[Elemental mage]]s in Zakhara specialized exclusively in one province, like sea, while [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]] took spells from two provinces, shunning the other two. Unlike [[elementalist]]s,<ref> magic-users from the Land of Fate recognized no opposition between sea and [[Flame (province)|flame]].

==Paths of power==
Zakharan practicioners of [[path magic]] recognized four paths of power within the province of sea:{{Cite dragon/216/Paths of Power}}<ref group="note">Paths to power are an alternative system of rules for the spell progression and learning of spells by [[wizards]] for [[2nd edition]] [[Dungeons & Dragons]]. They could therefore be considered non-canon.
*Sea Children's Road, manipulating water to ease travel and life in general
*[[Corsair (kit)|Corsair]]'s Path, containing spells affecting ships and sea travel
*Mistweaver's Path, using fog, water and ice to distract and attack
*Road of the [[Marid]], comprising spells to protect one against the elements and affect elemental water creatures
