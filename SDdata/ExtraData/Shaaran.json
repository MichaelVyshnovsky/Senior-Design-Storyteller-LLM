They had a simple view on life, focused on survival and following the herds roaming the plains of [[The Shaar]].",
        "Description": "Shaarans often had a reddish tint to their skin, but other shades were also possible. This variation seemed to be more predominant in Shaarans closest to Calmishan, while the Shaaryan people of the Shaar itself were described as being yellow-skinned and possessing long faces.",
        "Culture": {
            "History": "Shaarans roamed the grasslands of southern Faerûn for as long as anyone can remember. The [[Shoon Empire]] attempted to subjugate the Shaaran but the tribes rebelled in the fifth century DR and have remained independent ever since.",
            "Religion": "Most Shaarans worshiped gods of nature or the hunt. Many followed [[Tempus]] or [[Malar]] although a few worshiped [[Akadi]].",
            "Language": "Shaarans spoke [[Shaaran language|their own language]], which had no known connection to any other language in Faerûn. They continued their culture through a oral history from one generation to the next. Few Shaarans could read or write, but those who did used the [[Dethek]] alphabet learned from the [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] of the [[Great Rift]]."
