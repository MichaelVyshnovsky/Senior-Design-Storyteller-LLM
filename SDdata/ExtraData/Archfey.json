        "mainbody": "Archfey were fey beings who gained nearly god-like powers and established a position of preeminence among fey-kind. Each archfey had a unique appearance and set of abilities, most controlled a portion of the Feywild and had self-proclaimed titles.\nSome of them were powerful fey of many races, others were the awakened spirits of natural places such as forests or rivers, others the sentient incarnations of different types of animals, and others were noble eladrin so old and powerful they transcended the bounds of mortality. \nSome archfey were regarded as deities and granted divine abilities to their worshipers. Archfey could be contacted by a willing warlock to form a fey pact.\nArchfey were difficult to kill, for each one had a nemesis- an item, special condition, or creature- that could slay it, but only the nemesis could destroy them. Nemeses were unique to each archfey.\n* Baba Yaga, Mother of All Witches\n* Cerunnos, the Horned Lord\n* Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools\n* Neifion, the Lord of Bats\n* Nintra Siotta, the Princess of Shadow Glass\n* Oberon, the Green Lord\n* The Prince of Frost \n* Psilofyr\n* Queen of Air and Darkness\n* The Stag King, a dark fey who dwelled in Rashemen.\n* Titania, the Queen of the Seelie Court\n* Verenestra the Oak Princess\n* Kannoth, the Vampire Lord of Cendriane\n* Yarnspinner, an enormous spider archfey that is obsessed with stories. He owns Fablerise, a small domain of delight within Prismeer.\n* Zybilna, the Ruler of Prismeer and the patron of the Witchlight Carnival\nAdditionally, the deities Auril (under the name of Auriland√ºr), Relkath, Sarula Iliene, and Lurue were considered by some as archfey in the late years of the 15 century DR."
