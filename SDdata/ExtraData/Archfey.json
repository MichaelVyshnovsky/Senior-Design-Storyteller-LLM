        "mainbody": "Archfey''' were [[fey]] beings who gained nearly [[god]]-like powers and established a position of preeminence among fey-kind. Each archfey had a unique appearance and set of abilities, most controlled a portion of the [[Feywild]] and had self-proclaimed titles.\n\nSome of them were powerful fey of many races, others were the awakened spirits of natural places such as forests or rivers, others the sentient incarnations of different types of animals, and others were [[noble eladrin]] so old and powerful they transcended the bounds of mortality. \n\nSome archfey were regarded as deities and granted divine abilities to their worshipers.{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal}} Archfey could be contacted by a willing [[warlock]] to form a [[Warlock#Fey_pact: the Archfey|fey pact]].\n\nArchfey were difficult to kill, for each one had a nemesis- an item, special condition, or creature- that could slay it, but only the nemesis could destroy them. Nemeses were unique to each archfey.<ref><ref>{{Cite dungeon/162/Winter of the Witch|31}}",
