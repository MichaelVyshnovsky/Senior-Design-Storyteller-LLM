The  history of Waterdeep dated back to an ancient elven settlement called Aelinthaldaar, which was the capital of the Tel-quessir city-state of Illefarn starting around the year .
 Melairbode was created in the mountain beside and underneath Aelinthaldaar by the dwarven King Melair I, who began mining mithral there.
 Aelinthaldaar was razed after the elves inhabiting the city retreated to Evermeet. It was soon taken over by barbarian tribes who used it as a trade center from , doing business with peoples further south. The deep natural harbor on the site made it a particularly good point to hold trademoots because large ships were able to load and unload goods. Eventually, tribes made the area their permanent home rather than revisiting for each trademoot. However, conflict was common due to the lucrative trade opportunities. 
 The Netherese had moved to Melairbode uninvited, and made their home adjacent to the dwarves. The Sargauth Enclave was hewn from the rock by magic spells and then sealed. Over the years, a mantle was raised that served a similar purpose to a mythal. 
 The drow began to push the Melairkyn dwarves back and claimed more and more of the Undermountain for themselves.
 The disruption to the Weave caused the collapse of most of the Netherese enclave what remained came to be known as Skullport.
52 DR 
 By this year, a permanent farming community of Illuskans had been established. 
168 DR 
 The wizard Halaster Blackcloak moved to the area and constructed Halasters Hold a little ways northwest of the farming community. Between 171 DR and 308 DR he conducted Halasters Hunts which brutally exterminated the drow and duergar from Undermountain, clearing the space for his own purposes.
211 DR 
 The drow finally removed all the remaining Melairkyn from the Undermountain. 
302 DR 
 The waters of the Lizard Marsh rose, forcing the settlement of Tavaray to be abandoned. The human settlements on the future site of Waterdeep became much more isolated, and the lack of prosperity and outside contact caused the populace to split back into tribes.
307 DR 
 Halaster Blackcloaks apprentices, known as the Seven abandon Halasters Hold for the Undermountain. The wizards hold would subsequently fall into disrepair.
482 DR 
 A warlord from Tethyr named Ulbaerag Bloodhand came to the area and united the tribes, claiming the settlement as "Bloodhand Hold." It began exporting timber onto ships destined for areas further south that did not benefit from such large trees as could be found in the North. Ulbaerag actively rejected the opportunity to join the Kingdom of Phalorm, known as "the Realm of Three Crowns." It was not until his son came to power that Bloodhand Hold finally joined the Kingdom.
 Construction began on extensive building and irrigation projects.This irrigation must have been irrigation of the surrounding area and from the River Dessarin, as Waterdeep was not located on a river mouth. 
493 DR 
 The drow of the Undermountain finally abandoned their former home.
615 DR 
 The Horde of the Wastes overran Phalorm, destroying Uthtower and leading to the formation of the Mere of Dead Men. The Sword Mountains became infested with orcs but Bloodhand Hold survived.
 The collapse of the Realm of Three Crowns led to the formation of the Kingdom of Man. Despite Bloodhand Hold maintaining its independence, it was widely regarded as part of the kingdom. 
697 DR 
With no apparent heir to the Kingdom of Man, it collapsed into civil war. Despite the conflict, Bloodhand Hold remained. 
734 DR 
 Poor harvests and intense summer fires caused the leader of Bloodhand Hold, Raulbaera Bloodhand, to establish an outlying settlement named Rowan Hold. Years later it would come to be known as Amphail.
872/882 DR 
A tribal leader known as Nimoar the Reaver led his tribe in search of a new home after the fall of the elven kingdoms. Nimoar and his tribe came across Bloodhand Hold and had no trouble in seizing it for themselves, renaming it "Nimoars Hold.The City of Splendors (boxed set) says that the Bloodhand tribe was conquered by Nimoar in 872 DR.
887 DR 
 Nimoars Hold suffered a large pirate attack, but held strong and was rebuilt.
889 DR 
 The Bull Elk tribe from the Dessarin set Nimoars Hold ablaze, but were eventually defeated.
927 DR 
 As prophesied by the orc shaman, Wund of the Sword Mountains, the Blood Plague spread over the mountain peaks, and in the wake of this event, he unified the orcs unified under the leadership of King Uruth Ukrypt. Their growing presence would displace many beasts and monsters, including a great number of trolls.
Due to massive orc uprisings and population growth in the north, trolls were forced out of their homes and pushed south, into the area now known as the Evermoors. This migration caused a great and long-lasting conflict with the humans of Nimoars Hold.
932 DR 
 The first conflict of the Trollwars occurred in this year. Before the years end the humans purged the moors area of trolls.
936 DR 
 The orc armies of Uruth Ukrypt attacked Nimoars Hold in a series of battles that began the Orcfastings War. Although they had a number of victories, the Duke of Calandor would turn the tide of the war broke the orc siege in the Battle of Burning Cliffs. Eventually King Uruth fell in the Battle of Westwood and the orc shaman Wund shortly thereafter.
940 DR 
 The second conflict of the Trollwars erupted when the trolls made continual raids on human settlements. They continued for 12 years. 
 Nimoar died and Gharl was chosen to be the next "War Lord" of Nimoars Hold. 
 The use of the name "Waterdeep", as an alternate for "Nimoars Hold" came to common use.
952 DR 
 The 32-year-old mage Ahghairon used his arcane power to end the Trollwars in a decisive victory. However, the six Warlords of the city were killed in combat. A knight of Tyr named Samular Caradoon was recognized as a hero during this conflict and went on to form the Holy Order of Samular.
 A temple and monastery to Lathander was constructed outside the city, which would later be known as the Spires of the Morning.
974 DR 
 Following the conflict, a walled keep was constructed on the slopes of the mountain, and the walls continued to expand as more and more people from the surrounding area came to the stronghold for protection. During this time, the keep and surrounding are were known as the "Free City of Waterdeep". 
 1010 DR 
 Nimoars Hold came to be known as the Free City of Waterdeep. During this year the harbor was fortified and its walls expanded and rebuilt. 
 Lauroun became the first Warlord of Waterdeep.
1024 DR 
 The Waterdhavian adventurers known as the Dawnbringer Company raided Ukrypt, a sacred crypt to the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge, who raised the Broken Bone orc horde in retaliation. Although they were the first horde of orcs to leave the mountains in a generation, their assault on Waterdeep was stopped when they were attacked by the "Claws of the Coast", Lhammaruntosz.
1026 DR 
 The Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge mustered another horde of orcs from the Sword Mountains, known as the Black Claw and set them to assault Waterdeep. Warlord Laroun lost her life defending the city walls from the monstrous assailants. The orcs were finally defeated at Stump Bog. 
Following Larouns death, Warlord Raurlor became the ruler of Waterdeep.
1032 DR 
 Raurlor used the citys wealth to create a vast "Empire of the North". Ahghairon voiced strong opposition to this in 1032 DR, and Raurlor ordered that he was to be arrested. When Ahghairon used his magic to prevent his own arrest, Raurlor struck out at him, but Ahghairon turned Raurlors sword into a snake, which inflicted a poisonous bite, eventually killing him.
 Ahghairon declared himself the first "Lord" of Waterdeep, creating the nearly-entirely-anonymous governing body that would last for centuries. All Lords of the city save for one, initially himself, had their identities hidden from the citizens of the city.
 Under Ahghairon, Waterdeep secured the areas to the north for the humans and built new roads to interconnect them, while continuing to grow to five times its size, becoming more and more prosperous. The city developed the nickname "the Crown of the North." Ahghairon restructured the army and navy that Raurlor had built up into the city watch and the city guard. 
1035 DR 
 Waterdeep began to use its system of city wards. The four original wards were the Castle Ward, Trades Ward, Dock Ward and Temple Ward.
1037 DR 
 Creatures from another plane appeared in Waterdeep after emerging from the Undermountain. Ahghairon and one of the masked Lords, Kherris, turned them back.
1064 DR 
 The population of Waterdeep reached 50,000 inhabitants.
1071 DR 
 The renowned adventurer Ranressa Shiard returned to the slopes of Mount Waterdeep riding on the copper wyrm Galadaeros. This event led to Ahghairon placing a powerful mythal over the city, that acted as a magical barrier against the flying beasts. 
1076 DR 
 Waterdeep was attacked by Nelethra the Winged Spear and the Tethyrian Black Boar of the Dessarin Valley. 
1101 DR 
 The city walls were further expanded to include the Spires of the Morning, the temple to Lathandar that had previously been outside the city.
1148 DR 
 The netherese necromancer Shradin Mulophor, who would come to be known as the "Lord of Bones", discovered the ruins of the Sargauth Enclave and used the destroyed chambers as his own personal domain. He would open up trade routes with various powers of the Underdark by linking the Sargauth river with subterranean waterways and a series of portals to other lands. 
1150 DR 
 Waterdeep was hit by the plague that was travelling the Sword Coast. Khelben the Elder first arrived in the city. 
1173 DR 
 The Lord of Bones lair was a permanent settlement by this year and came to be known as the "Port of Shadow", or Skullport. 
1179 DR 
 Maulagrym attacked Blackstaff Tower but was defeated by Khelben, Elminster, Hamiklar Wands and other Waterdhavian mages.
1184 DR 
 The Lord of Bones took an expedition to the Underhalls and returned to Skullport as an unstable and unpredictable man. 
1235 DR 
 The Sword Coast was overrun and Waterdeep besieged by the largest orc horde in recorded history. The siege of the city lasted for nine months, and was broken when Ahghairon used griffons to fly supplies of food and aid into of the city. These brave actions would lead to the formation of the griffon cavalry. 
1246 DR 
 The Masked Lord Kerrigan began slaying other Lords of the city. He murdered three of the citys rulers in a bid for power, before Ahghairon confronted him in a battle of magic that ended in the Masked Lords death within the Southern Ward. This was the only known act of betrayal among the Lords of Waterdeep.
1248 DR 
 As crime and deceit began to develop in Waterdeep, Ahghairon ordered the creation of city guilds, a trend from cities in the south, to prevent the further spread of problems. 
1250 DR 
 Owing to a lack of space, the individual graves within Waterdeeps graveyard were replaced with tombs,leading to the creation of the City of the Dead. 
1252 DR 
 Problems with undead from within the most-recently-constructed wae led to the raising of walls around the City of the Dead, to segregate it from the rest of the city. 
1255 DR 
 The Shadow Thieves began operating within the city of Waterdeep. 
1256 DR 
 Lord Ahghairon passed away and was ceremoniously interred within his tower. It was sealed away, protected by magic, and as of the mid-14 century DR had never been disturbed. Turmoil followed Ahghairons death while the merchants of Waterdeep bickered over who would assume power. Nothing was heard from the masked Lords of Waterdeep. This was because most of their identities had already been compromised and they had been murdered.
 In truth, following Ahghairons death, the only surviving Masked Lords were the woodworker Baeron and the apprentice wizard Shilarn. After two months, power was taken by the Council of Guildmasters, who had been appointed by Ahghairon. This left the Council of Guilds in charge of the citys rule.
 The guildwars began. This six-year-long period of bickering and mistrust was highlighted by violent feuds between the mercantile families at the hands of hired mercenaries.
1262 DR 
 The guildwars ended with a great amount of bloodshed within the city. After the conflict, only two surviving guildmasters, the gemcutter Ehlemm Zoar and shipwright Lhorar Gildeggh were left in positions of leadership. Sick and tired of the infighting, they agreed to rule together, as "Lords Magister," in 1262 DR. Despite their initial partnership, they would agree on little else. Their bickering led to continued tensions within the city and would come to be known as the "Misrule of the Lords-Magister".
The Shadow Thieves began operations within the city.
1273 DR 
The Lords Magister were visited by Baeron and Shilarn who had concealed themselves underneath cloaks. Shilarn ordered the Lords Magister to leave the city. When they refused, she struck them down with magic and killed them both. Baeron and Shilarn, the two remaining former masked Lords, took power and reinstalled the Lords of Waterdeep. Baeron publicly revealed his identity and assumed the role of the Open Lord. 
The Gildeggh and Zoar houses were banned from Waterdeep. 
In order to further prevent the discovery of the identities of the Masked Lords, a group of Magisters named the Black Robes were instated as judges and dispensers of the law. Uktar The Shadow Thieves were outlawed in Waterdeep. 
1276 DR 
 Lhestyn was born to Baeron and Shilarn. 
The city expanded to contain six wards, with the addition of North Ward and Sea Ward. 
1298 DR 
 Lhestyn, under the alias of the "Masked Lady", infiltrated the thieves guild of Waterdeep and exposed them throughout the city. The groups members were either killed outright or were chased out of the city.
1300 DR 
 Lhestyn and Zelphar Arunsun of Neverwinter, the youngest son of Khelben the Elder, were married.
1302 DR 
 Lhestyn gave birth to Khelben Arunsun the Younger, son of Zelphar and grandson Khelben "Blackstaff".
1308 DR 
 Lord Baeron died of a fever, and his wife Shilarn threw herself onto his funeral pyre. 
 Lhestyn became the Open Lord of Waterdeep. 
 Lhestyns Palace was constructed over the ruins of an old Chauntean abbey. 
1311 DR 
 As an act of favor to the Shadow Thieves, an anonymous lich of the Twisted Rune murdered Zelphar Arunsun by means of an arcane hand of force. The identity of Zelphars killer would remain unknown to the lords of the city for well over a century. 
After the death of his son, Khelben "Blackstaff" returned to Blackstaff Tower to train his grandson as the new Blackstaff. Khelben the Younger assumed lordship over the tower. 
To better protect the Open Lord and their loved ones, the Masked Lord Durnan formed the Red Sashes.

1314 DR 
 Lady Lhestyn died and Piergeiron took over as Open Lord of Waterdeep. 
1321 DR

1345 DR 
 During the Night of the Temple Fires, religious disorder between the churches of Lathander, Selûne, Shar and Tempus led to the Spires of the Morning and the House of Heroes to be burned to the ground. Both were rebuilt within a year. 
1355 DR 
 Amril Zoar, member of the exiled Zoar family killed two masked lords of the city, Lady Tamaeril Bladesemmer and Lord Resengar the Whitebeard and gravely wounded Lord Piergeiron. After he was caught, he was spared execution by Storm Silverhand and the Harpers. 
1356 DR 
 The Dragonspear Wars break out after patrols of Waterdhavian soldiers were attacked by fiends and goblins from the Open Marches by means of Dragonspear Castle.

 Waterdeep negotiated peace between Ruathym and the city of Luskan. 
During the Time of Troubles in the Year of Shadows, magic went awry within Waterdeep as everywhere else in the Realms. 
1358 DR 
Kythorn 20 Mystra, greater goddess of magic and among the most powerful of the gods, was destroyed. An avatar of a goddess appeared in Waterdeep, calling the faithful to her. The next night, they gathered at the House of the Moon temple and proclaimed her to be Selûne, the Moonmaiden. However, Lord Piergeiron and Khelben Arunsun were wary, and proposed to play good but watchful hosts. At the avatars instigation, a mob attacked the supposed unbeliever Vajra Valmeyjar, while the avatar defeated Luna in spell-battle on the steps of the temple before the faithful. The avatar was later guest of honour at a party at Castle Waterdeep, but this was disrupted by the Dark Army of the Night and then by a spell-battle between the avatar and Kyriani. Piergeiron and the nobility came to feel the goddesss behavior was reckless and they may have been hasty in welcoming her. 
thumb|right|Selûne and Shar do battle over the streets of Waterdeep. 
 Chaotic magic caused the streets of Waterdeep to warp and twist, turning flat roads to hummocks and dips in the Dock Ward and Sea Ward. Ultimately, after infiltrating the House of the Moon and rescuing Luna, the heroes of the Selûnes Smile tavern—Vajra, Kyriani, Timoth Eyesbright, and Onyx the Invincible—exposed the false avatar as the goddess Shar, while Luna herself was truly Selûne. Returning to the Selûnes Smile, they were attacked by trio of night riders and their gaunts, and saw the Celestial Stairway rising from Mount Waterdeep. Shar attacked the heroes at the ruins of the tavern, but ultimately they renewed Selûne. Selûnes defeat of Shar over the streets of Waterdeep became famous across the Realms. 
 Later on Midnight and her companions, Cyric, Kelemvor and Adon, arrived in Waterdeep. Shortly thereafter Myrkul appeared in the city from the Pool of Loss beneath the Yawning Portal inn with one of the Tablets of Fate and summoned legion of fiends and undead that poured into the city, causing huge fires and widespread destruction, mostly in the Castle, Dock and Southern Wards of the city. Midnight and her companions were accompanied by Elminster and Khelben the Elder as they holed up in Blackstaff Tower. having hidden the tablet within the spires library.
 Before Myrkul could ascend the Celestial Staircase, Midnight managed to steal one of the tablets, in thanks to her growing arcane power. The god and her minions attacked Midnight and her allies. 
 Midnight and Cyric ascended to godhood.

1372 DR 
 Khelben Blackstaff, Storm and Laeral Silverhand led armies against the phaerimm that escaped from the Sharn Wall. 1374 DR By this year, the only remnants of the long-razed Aelinthaldaar were crypts beneath the Pantheon Temple of the Seldarine, and the magic that prevented the plateau from collapsing.
1375 DR 
 Eleint 30 Halaster Blackcloak died. As a result, earthquakes ravaged the city and many Waterdhavians had visions related to the mages death.
1378 DR 
 Piergeirons loyal bodyguard Madeiron Sunderstone is killed in an assassination attempt on Open Lord of Waterdeep.
1379 DR 
 Piergeiron the Paladinson dies in office of age and ill health, after several assassination attempts at the hands of those increasingly impatient to replace him with their various stooges.
A month after his death, after many candidates had been proposed by various Masked Lords, but rejected by others, he was succeeded by the respected-in-trade parchment, paper, and bookbinding merchant Audreithra Teltorna. She was a compromise candidate, initially seen within the Lords and across the city as a caretaker, but who won respect while in office.
1385 DR 
 Tarsakh 29 The spellplague ravaged Toril, dramatically altering the landscape of Faerûn.
 Six walking statues were exiled from the ethereal plane and rampaged through the city.
 In the tumult, agents of Xanathar succeed at assassinating Open Lord Audreithra Teltorna , intending to install their puppet among the Masked Lords as her replacement. However, they overplayed their hand, and their candidate, the shipwright Andramas Rujyntral , was rejected by the Lords. A flurry of assassinations among the Lords followed as the Xanathars agents took their revenge and sought to eliminate rival candidates within the Lords and Rujyntrals most steadfast opponents, but this goaded various lords to hire adventurers to assassinate both Rujyntral and any of the Xanathars agents they could identify and hunt down. They succeeded so well that the Xanathar not only lost Rujyntral, it suffered the loss of so many loyal human agents that it decided to retreat into the shadows, rebuilding its network with slow care and keeping well away from the Masked Lords (a policy that remained in force until a new Xanathar succeeded to the title).
 The Masked Lords endured a little more than three months without an Open Lord at the helm, until the ravages of the Spellplague demanded that their appointed spokesperson (Acting Voice of the Lords) Watchlord Phulundaera Vantur (a seasoned veteran whod risen through the ranks her much-scarred body incorporated magically-bonded limbs and organs from fallen comrades) be adopted as the New Open Lord. Phulundaera was street-wise and gruff and no-nonsense, and the guilds and just plain citizens of the streets loved her, because she stood for equality of treatment under city laws and policy, for the high and the low. This same quality made her detested by the nobles and wannabe nobles nouveau riche, and they tried to arrange many accidents for her.
1395 DR  
 A plague called the Putrescent Anathema, which originated from Stump Bog, devastated Waterdeep and the surrounding area, particularly the Goldenfields. The combination of disease and lost grain supply killed thousands throughout the realm.

1445 DR 
 Timehands, a "golemwork clock" was completed and installed in the tallest tower of Lords Palace. 
 c. 1468 DR
Dagult Neverember, the richest man in the city, became Open Lord.
1479 DR
By this year, the Field Ward had been established, and Skullport was no longer inhabited. 
The 8 walking statue, the Griffon, appeared in Waterdeep and to defend Ahghairons Tower. It eventually settled down near the Peaktop Aerie on Mount Waterdeep and eventually became a landmark of the city.
 1489 DR
In response to increasing dragon and cultist activity, the Council of Waterdeep was formed, bringing together representatives of realms from all across the Sword Coast. The threat of the Cult of the Dragon was driven home when Masked Lord Arthagast Ulbrinter was assassinated, though it inspired more resolve than fear. In the midst of these events, Open Lord Dagult Neverember was ousted by a vote of the Lords of Waterdeep, replaced by Laeral Silverhand. Although Waterdeep was largely spared due to the dragonward, the Field Ward was still burned to ashes by dragon attacks, displacing huge numbers of people.
1490 DR
The cloud giant castle of Count Nimbolo and Countess Mulara appeared out of clouds and hovered over Waterdeep for a while, triggering mass panic. Heralds sent out by Lady Laeral Silverhand tried to calm citizens and promise that there was no danger. In fact, the giants wanted to research Waterdeeps history and meet its leaders, as they search for traces of the ancient giant realm of Ostoria.Page 13 of Storm Kings Thunder gives a range of possible dates for the adventure, from 1486 DR to 1493 DR. As the adventure is a direct follow-up of the events of The Rise of Tiamat, set in 1489 DR, an earlier date would be impossible. Fortunately, page 112 of Storm Kings Thunder also describes Laeral Silverhand as having been Open Lord for "only a few months", which would place it in 1490 DR.
1491 DR
The returned Eilistraee appeared under the walls of Waterdeep causing an influx in the amount of her followers in the city. They eventually sought out Remallia Haventree and asked her for a holy forest-glade in the ruins of the Field Ward. By Mirtul, the housing crisis in Waterdeep had worsened as a mysterious sickness killed or drove out all of the inhabitants of Downshadow, the Field Ward remained desolated by dragonfire, and Mistshore was burned down by agents of Masked Lord Braethan Cazondur, rendering all three unofficial wards uninhabitable.
Fear threatened to overtake Waterdeep once again as the cloud giant castle of Burruld hovered over the ocean near the city. After the Blackstaff Vajra Safahr panicked and threatened the giants, Open Lord Laeral Silverhand calmed the situation, negotiated with Burruld, and learned that their purpose was to search for the lost daughter of King Skyvald, Princess Irie.
In mid-Mirtul, numerous Masked Lords and other people were gruesomely assassinated as part of Cazondurs conspiracy to seize control of the city. Open Lord Laeral Silverhand, assisted by Elminster and Mirt, worked to maintain order in the city while investigating the murders. While attempting to apprehend Cazondur, Laeral herself was killed and disintegrated by a surprisingly simple trap involving falling rocks, but recovered with Elminsters assistance. An exceedingly dramatic showdown at the Palace of Waterdeep between Laeral and Cazondur in front of assembled servants, nobles and guildmasters resulted in Cazondurs death at the hands of an unexpected third party, Xanathar agents Belvarra Bowmantle and Suthool. Including Cazondur, a total of thirteen Masked Lords and scores of others were slain, and several more Lords publicly unmasked.
A delegation from the city of Mirabar disappeared while en route to the city, having been waylaid by cultists of the Elder Elemental Eye.
1492 DR
Violence erupted in the streets and backrooms of the city as competing factions searched for former Open Lord Dagult Neverembers embezzled hoard of gold, guided by the Stone of Golorr. The Gralhunds, the Cassalanters, Jarlaxle, Manshoon, Xanathar, and others caused no end of problems for each other and the city as they fought for the prize. The treasure was eventually found in a hidden section of Melairkyn ruins inside of Undermountain, guarded by the gold dragon Aurinax, who had also been given the Dragonstaff of Ahghairon by Neverember.
