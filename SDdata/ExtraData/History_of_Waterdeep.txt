{{main|Waterdeep}} 
The ''' history of Waterdeep''' dated back to an ancient [[elven]] settlement called [[Aelinthaldaar]], which was the capital of the [[Tel-quessir]] city-state of [[Illefarn]] starting around the year {{Yearlink|-8500}}.

==Early history== 
;{{Yearlink|-1288}}: 
: [[Melairbode]] was created in the mountain beside and underneath Aelinthaldaar by the [[dwarf|dwarven]] King [[Melair I]], who began mining [[mithral]] there.

;{{Yearlink|-1100}}: 
: Aelinthaldaar was razed after the elves inhabiting the city [[retreat]]ed to [[Evermeet]]. It was soon taken over by barbarian tribes who used it as a trade center from {{Yearlink|-1088}}, doing business with peoples further south. The deep natural harbor on the site made it a particularly good point to hold trademoots because large ships were able to load and unload goods. Eventually, tribes made the area their permanent home rather than revisiting for each trademoot. However, conflict was common due to the lucrative trade opportunities. 

;{{Yearlink|-750}}: 
: The [[Netherese]] had moved to Melairbode uninvited, and made their home adjacent to the dwarves. The [[Sargauth Enclave]] was hewn from the rock by magic spells and then sealed. Over the years, a mantle was raised that served a similar purpose to a [[mythal]].{{Fact}} 

;{{Yearlink|-677}}: 
: The drow began to push the Melairkyn dwarves back and claimed more and more of the Undermountain for themselves.{{fact}}

;{{Yearlink|-339}}: 
: The disruption to the [[Weave]] caused the collapse of most of the Netherese enclave; what remained came to be known as [[Skullport]].{{fact}}

;[[52 DR]]: 
: By this year, a permanent farming community of [[Illusk]]ans had been established.{{fact}} 

===Blackcloak Hold=== 
;[[168 DR]]: 
: The wizard [[Halaster Blackcloak]] moved to the area and constructed [[Halaster's Hold]] a little ways northwest of the farming community. Between [[171 DR]] and [[308 DR]] he conducted [[Halaster's Hunts]] which brutally exterminated the [[drow]] and [[duergar]] from Undermountain, clearing the space for his own purposes.{{fact}}

;[[211 DR]]: 
: The drow finally removed all the remaining Melairkyn from the Undermountain.{{fact}} 

;[[302 DR]]: 
: The waters of the [[Lizard Marsh]] rose, forcing the settlement of [[Tavaray]] to be abandoned. The human settlements on the future site of Waterdeep became much more isolated, and the lack of prosperity and outside contact caused the populace to split back into tribes.{{fact}}

;[[307 DR]]: 
: Halaster Blackcloak's apprentices, known as the [[Seven]] abandon Halaster's Hold for the [[Undermountain]]. The wizard's hold would subsequently fall into disrepair.{{fact}}

===Bloodhand Hold=== 
;[[482 DR]]: 
: A warlord from [[Tethyr]] named [[Ulbaerag Bloodhand]] came to the area and united the tribes, claiming the settlement as "Bloodhand Hold." It began exporting timber onto ships destined for areas further south that did not benefit from such large trees as could be found in the North. Ulbaerag actively rejected the opportunity to join the [[Phalorm|Kingdom of Phalorm]], known as "the Realm of Three Crowns." It was not until his son came to power that Bloodhand Hold finally joined the Kingdom.{{fact}}

: Construction began on extensive building and irrigation projects.{{fact}}<ref group="note">This irrigation must have been irrigation of the surrounding area and from the [[River Dessarin]], as Waterdeep was not located on a river mouth. 

;[[493 DR]]: 
: The drow of the Undermountain finally abandoned their former home.{{fact}}

;[[615 DR]]: 
: The [[Horde of the Wastes]] overran Phalorm, destroying [[Uthtower]] and leading to the formation of the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. The [[Sword Mountains]] became infested with [[orc]]s but Bloodhand Hold survived.

: The collapse of the Realm of Three Crowns led to the formation of the [[Kingdom of Man]]. Despite [[Bloodhand Hold]] maintaining its independence, it was widely regarded as part of the kingdom. 

;[[697 DR]]: 
:With no apparent heir to the Kingdom of Man, it collapsed into civil war. Despite the conflict, Bloodhand Hold remained. {{fact}}

;[[734 DR]]: 
: Poor harvests and intense summer fires caused the leader of Bloodhand Hold, [[Raulbaera Bloodhand]], to establish an outlying settlement named [[Rowan Hold]]. Years later it would come to be known as [[Amphail]].{{fact}}

===Nimoar's Hold=== 
;[[872 DR|872]]/[[882 DR]]: 
:A tribal leader known as [[Nimoar|Nimoar the Reaver]] led his tribe in search of a new home after the fall of the elven kingdoms. Nimoar and his tribe came across Bloodhand Hold and had no trouble in seizing it for themselves, renaming it "Nimoar's Hold.{{fact}}<ref group="note">The [[City of Splendors (boxed set)]] says that the [[Bloodhand]] tribe was conquered by [[Nimoar]] in [[872 DR]].

;[[927 DR]]: 
: As prophesied by the orc [[shaman]], [[Wund]] of the [[Sword Mountains]], the [[Blood Plague]] spread over the mountain peaks, and in the wake of this event, he unified the orcs unified under the leadership of [[Uruth|King Uruth Ukrypt]]. Their growing presence would displace many beasts and monsters, including a great number of [[troll]]s.

==Age of Warlords== 
===[[Trollwars]]=== 
Due to massive [[orc]] uprisings and population growth in the north, [[troll]]s were forced out of their homes and pushed south, into the area now known as the [[Evermoors]]. This migration caused a great and long-lasting conflict with the [[human]]s of Nimoar's Hold.{{fact}}

;[[932 DR]]: 
: The first conflict of the Trollwars occurred in this year. Before the year's end the humans purged the moors area of trolls.{{fact}}

;[[936 DR]]: 
: The orc armies of [[Uruth Ukrypt]] attacked Nimoar's Hold in a series of battles that began the [[Orcfastings War]]. Although they had a number of victories, the [[Duke]] of [[Calandor]] would turn the tide of the war broke the orc siege in the [[Battle of Burning Cliffs]]. Eventually King Uruth fell in the [[Battle of Westwood]] and the orc shaman Wund shortly thereafter.

;[[952 DR]]: 
: The 32-year-old [[mage]] [[Ahghairon]] used his [[arcane]] power to end the Trollwars in a decisive victory. However, the six Warlords of the city were killed in combat.

;[[974 DR]]: 
: Following the conflict, a [[Castle Waterdeep|walled keep]] was constructed on the slopes of the [[Mount Waterdeep|mountain]], and the walls continued to expand as more and more people from the surrounding area came to the stronghold for protection. During this time, the keep and surrounding are were known as the "Free City of Waterdeep".{{fact}} 

; [[1010 DR]]:

;[[1024 DR]]: 
: The Waterdhavian adventurers known as the [[Dawnbringer Company]] raided [[Ukrypt]], a sacred crypt to the [[Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge]], who raised the [[Broken Bone]] orc horde in retaliation.

;[[1026 DR]]: 
: The Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge mustered another horde of orcs from the Sword Mountains, known as the [[Black Claw]] and set them to assault Waterdeep. Warlord Laroun lost her life defending the city walls from the monstrous assailants. The orcs were finally defeated at [[Stump Bog]]. 

:Following Laroun's death, Warlord [[Raurlor]] became the ruler of Waterdeep.{{fact}}

==Age of Ahghairon== 
;[[1032 DR]]: 
: Raurlor used the city's wealth to create a vast "Empire of [[Northwest Faer√ªn|the North]]". Ahghairon voiced strong opposition to this in [[1032 DR]], and Raurlor ordered that he was to be arrested. When Ahghairon used his magic to prevent his own arrest, Raurlor struck out at him, but Ahghairon turned Raurlor's sword into a snake, which inflicted a poisonous bite, eventually killing him.{{fact}}

: Ahghairon declared himself the first "Lord" of Waterdeep, creating the nearly-entirely-anonymous [[Lords of Watrdeep|governing body]] that would last for centuries. All Lords of the city save [[Open Lord|for one]], initially himself, had their identities hidden from the citizens of the city.{{fact}}

: Under Ahghairon, Waterdeep secured the areas to the north for the humans and built new roads to interconnect them, while continuing to grow to five times its size, becoming more and more prosperous. The city developed the nickname "the Crown of the North." Ahghairon restructured the army and navy that Raurlor had built up into the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|city watch]] and the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|city guard]].{{fact}} 

;[[1035 DR]]: 
: Waterdeep began to use its system of city wards. The four original wards were the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]], [[Trades Ward of Waterdeep|Trades Ward]], [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]] and [[Southern Ward of Waterdeep|Temple Ward]].{{fact}}

;[[1071 DR]]: 
: The renowned adventurer [[Ranressa Shiard]] returned to the slopes of [[Mount Waterdeep]] riding on the [[Copper dragon|copper]] [[wyrm]] [[Galadaeros]].

;[[1076 DR]]:

;[[1148 DR]]:

;[[1246 DR]]: 
: The Masked Lord [[Kerrigan]] began slaying other Lords of the city. He murdered three of the city's rulers in a bid for power, before Ahghairon confronted him in a battle of magic that ended in the Masked Lord's death within the [[South Ward of Waterdeep|Southern Ward]]. This was the only known act of betrayal among the Lords of Waterdeep.

;[[1248 DR]]: 
: As crime and deceit began to develop in Waterdeep, Ahghairon ordered the creation of city [[Guilds of Waterdeep|guilds]], a trend from cities in the [[Lands of Intrigue|south]], to prevent the further spread of problems.

==Reign of Guildmasters== 
;[[1256 DR]]: 
: Lord Ahghairon passed away and was ceremoniously interred within [[Ahghairon's tower|his tower]]. It was sealed away, protected by magic, and as of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] had never been disturbed. Turmoil followed Ahghairon's death while the merchants of Waterdeep bickered over who would assume power. Nothing was heard from the masked [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. This was because most of their identities had already been compromised and they had been murdered.

: In truth, following Ahghairon's death, the only surviving Masked Lords were the woodworker [[Baeron]] and the apprentice wizard [[Shilarn]]. After two months, power was taken by the [[Council of Guildmasters]], who had been appointed by Ahghairon. This left the [[Council of Guilds]] in charge of the city's rule.

: The [[guildwars]] began. This six-year-long period of bickering and mistrust was highlighted by violent feuds between the mercantile families at the hands of hired mercenaries.

;[[1262 DR]]: 
: The guildwars ended with a great amount of bloodshed within the city. After the conflict, only two surviving guildmasters, the gemcutter [[Ehlemm Zoar]] and shipwright [[Lhorar Gildeggh]] were left in positions of leadership. Sick and tired of the infighting, they agreed to rule together, as "Lords Magister," in [[1262 DR]]. Despite their initial partnership, they would agree on little else. Their bickering led to continued tensions within the city and would come to be known as the "Misrule of the Lords-Magister".

;[[1273 DR]]:

Baeron publicly revealed his identity and assumed the role of the [[Open Lord]]. 

:The [[Gildeggh]] and [[Zoar]] houses were banned from Waterdeep.

:After the death of his son, Khelben "Blackstaff" returned to Blackstaff Tower to train his grandson as the new [[Blackstaff]]. Khelben the Younger assumed lordship over the tower. 

:To better protect the Open Lord and their loved ones, the Masked Lord [[Durnan]] formed the [[Red Sashes]].

;[[1385 DR]]: 
: [[Tarsakh 29]]: The [[spellplague]] ravaged Toril, dramatically altering the landscape of [[Faer√ªn]].

: Six [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep|walking statues]] were exiled from the [[ethereal plane]] and rampaged through the city.

: In the tumult, agents of [[Xanathar]] succeed at assassinating Open Lord [[Audreithra Teltorna]] , intending to install their puppet among the [[Lords of Waterdeep|Masked Lords]] as her replacement. However, they overplayed their hand, and their candidate, the shipwright [[Andramas Rujyntral]] , was rejected by the Lords. A flurry of assassinations among the Lords followed as the Xanathar's agents took their revenge and sought to eliminate rival candidates within the Lords and Rujyntral's most steadfast opponents, but this goaded various lords to hire adventurers to assassinate both Rujyntral and any of the Xanathar's agents they could identify and hunt down. They succeeded so well that the Xanathar not only lost Rujyntral, it suffered the loss of so many loyal human agents that it decided to retreat into the shadows, rebuilding its network with slow care and keeping well away from the Masked Lords (a policy that remained in force until a new Xanathar succeeded to the title).{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318744196308993| title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318745328758784| title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318746406707200 | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318747526647808 | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318748659101696  | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}

: The Masked Lords endured a little more than three months without an Open Lord at the helm, until the ravages of the Spellplague demanded that their appointed spokesperson (Acting Voice of the Lords) Watchlord [[Phulundaera Vantur]] (a seasoned veteran who'd risen through the ranks; her much-scarred body incorporated magically-bonded limbs and organs from fallen comrades) be adopted as the New Open Lord. Phulundaera was street-wise and gruff and no-nonsense, and the guilds and just plain citizens of the streets loved her, because she stood for equality of treatment under city laws and policy, for the high and the low. This same quality made her detested by the nobles and 'wannabe nobles' nouveau riche, and they tried to arrange many accidents for her.{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318748659101696  | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318749695029248  | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318750907224065  | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}{{cite web| url = https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/1201318751989387264  | title          =TheEdVerse| accessdate = | accessmonthday = | accessyear = | author = [[Ed Greenwood]]| last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = Dec 1, 2019| year = }}

;[[1395 DR]] : 
: A plague called the [[Putrescent Anathema]], which originated from Stump Bog, devastated Waterdeep and the surrounding area, particularly the [[Goldenfields]]. The combination of disease and lost grain supply killed thousands throughout the realm.

: The majority of the effects of the Spellplague came to an end and most arcane magic returned to normal.{{Cite web/Dragon Features Archive|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/drfe/20080227a|title=Spellplague: The Wailing Years|author=[[Brian R.

: [[Timehands]], a "golemwork clock" was completed and installed in the tallest tower of Lord's Palace.<ref>

:[[Dagult Neverember]], the richest man in the city, became Open Lord.{{NeveremberOpenLord}}

;[[1479 DR]]:
:By this year, the [[Field Ward of Waterdeep|Field Ward]] had been established, and Skullport was no longer inhabited. 

:The 8{{th}} walking statue, [[the Griffon]], appeared in Waterdeep and to defend Ahghairon's Tower. It eventually settled down near the [[Peaktop Aerie]] on Mount Waterdeep and eventually became a landmark of the city.

; [[1489 DR]]:
:In response to increasing dragon and cultist activity, the Council of Waterdeep was formed, bringing together representatives of realms from all across the Sword Coast. The threat of the Cult of the Dragon was driven home when Masked Lord [[Arthagast Ulbrinter]] was assassinated, though it inspired more resolve than fear. In the midst of these events, Open Lord Dagult Neverember was ousted by a vote of the Lords of Waterdeep, replaced by [[Laeral Silverhand]].{{LaeralOpenLord}} Although Waterdeep was largely spared due to the [[Ahghairon's dragonward|dragonward]], the [[Waterdeep/Field Ward|Field Ward]] was still burned to ashes by dragon attacks, displacing huge numbers of people.

;[[1490 DR]]:
:The [[cloud giant]] [[cloud palace|castle]] of [[Nimbolo|Count Nimbolo]] and [[Mulara|Countess Mulara]] appeared out of clouds and hovered over Waterdeep for a while, triggering mass panic. Heralds sent out by Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]] tried to calm citizens and promise that there was no danger. In fact, the giants wanted to research Waterdeep's history and meet its leaders, as they search for traces of the ancient giant realm of [[Ostoria]].<ref group="note">Page 13 of [[Storm King's Thunder]] gives a range of possible dates for the adventure, from [[1486 DR]] to [[1493 DR]]. As the adventure is a direct follow-up of the events of [[The Rise of Tiamat]], set in [[1489 DR]], an earlier date would be impossible. Fortunately, page 112 of Storm King's Thunder also describes Laeral Silverhand as having been Open Lord for "only a few months", which would place it in [[1490 DR]].

;[[1491 DR]]:
:The returned [[Eilistraee]] appeared under the walls of Waterdeep causing an influx in the amount of her followers in the city. They eventually sought out [[Remallia Haventree]] and asked her for a holy forest-glade in the ruins of the [[Field Ward]]. By [[Mirtul]], the housing crisis in Waterdeep had worsened as a mysterious sickness killed or drove out all of the inhabitants of [[Downshadow]], the Field Ward remained desolated by dragonfire, and [[Mistshore]] was burned down by agents of Masked Lord [[Braethan Cazondur]], rendering all three unofficial wards uninhabitable.

:Fear threatened to overtake Waterdeep once again as the [[cloud giant]] [[cloud palace|castle]] of [[Burruld]] hovered over the ocean near the city. After the [[Blackstaff]] [[Vajra Safahr]] panicked and threatened the giants, Open Lord Laeral Silverhand calmed the situation, negotiated with Burruld, and learned that their purpose was to search for the lost daughter of King [[Skyvald]], Princess Irie.

:In mid-Mirtul, numerous Masked Lords and other people were gruesomely assassinated as part of Cazondur's conspiracy to seize control of the city. Open Lord Laeral Silverhand, assisted by [[Elminster]] and [[Mirt]], worked to maintain order in the city while investigating the murders. While attempting to apprehend Cazondur, Laeral herself was killed and disintegrated by a surprisingly simple trap involving falling rocks, but recovered with Elminster's assistance. An exceedingly dramatic showdown at the Palace of Waterdeep between Laeral and Cazondur in front of assembled servants, nobles and guildmasters resulted in Cazondur's death at the hands of an unexpected third party, [[Xanathar]] agents [[Belvarra Bowmantle]] and [[Suthool]]. Including Cazondur, a total of thirteen Masked Lords and scores of others were slain, and several more Lords publicly unmasked.

:A delegation from the city of [[Mirabar]] disappeared while en route to the city, having been waylaid by cultists of the [[Elder Elemental Eye]].

;[[1492 DR]]:
:Violence erupted in the streets and backrooms of the city as competing factions searched for former Open Lord Dagult Neverember's embezzled hoard of gold, guided by the [[Stone of Golorr]]. The [[Gralhund|Gralhunds]], the [[Cassalanter|Cassalanters]], [[Jarlaxle]], [[Manshoon]], [[Xanathar]], and others caused no end of problems for each other and the city as they fought for the prize. The treasure was eventually found in a hidden section of [[Melairkyn]] ruins inside of [[Undermountain]], guarded by the [[gold dragon]] [[Aurinax]], who had also been given the [[Dragonstaff of Ahghairon]] by Neverember.
