The Dark Disaster, or the Killing Storms, was a tragedy in  that totally turned the territory of the elven kingdom of Miyeritar into a barren wasteland.
In , the largely dark- and wild-elven nation of Miyeritar was annexed by the sun-elven nation Aryvandaar and pacified by . The Dark Disaster struck  and killed many innocents, though a large number of Miyeritar’s original inhabitants already left for other places.
The Killing Storms weren’t a natural disaster but an artificial one. It is said that elven high mages on Miyeritars side accidentally caused the Disaster when they broke a taboo and tried to harness corrupt magic for resistance reasons, which is what the victors in Aryvandaar wrote in the historical records. It was actually caused by the high mages from Aryvandaar, who had had Miyeritar’s high mages assassinated to drop the nation’s defences against the Killing Storms.
The Killing Storms reduced the entire forest and realm into barren wastelands in three months. The scoured land later became known as the High Moor.
Four decades of uneasy peace followed.
