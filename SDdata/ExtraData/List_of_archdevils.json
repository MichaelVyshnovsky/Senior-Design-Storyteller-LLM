He had glittering pink eyes, oily black hair, tiny horns, a forked tail, red hooves, and a hoarse, hissing voice.",
        "mainbody": "hongor was second to only Asmodeus himself as the most feared devil in Nessus. The inquisitor was directly responsible to Asmodeus for providing complete and accurate news of all planes, the Hells included, and little escaped his probing and persuasive tactics. To accomplish his duties he subverted the spies of Adramalech, enlisted his own spies, and then enlisted spies to spy on his spies, for he was wholly paranoid and trusted no-one. Furthermore, he had perfected the arts of torture on all manner of beings, from the denziens of Hell to the intruders, using his many instruments of pain, both delicate and brutal, in the depths of Malsheem.\n\nPhongor typically wore black or purple robes left open. He could use any weapon proficiently, but he carried his weapon of choice in his belt, a venom-coated [[cat-of-nine-tails]] with tempered wire strands (rather than the usual cord). He was accompanied by two pit fiends bodyguards and a troupe of 6-11 [[spinagon]] servants while in Malsheem.\n\nPhongor could feel no pain himself, remaining unfazed by any injury that didn't physically disable him, and had very minor regeneration. He had various unique powers including; ''[[sending]]'' to Asmodeus at will; causing disease, [[purify food and drink|putrefying food and drink]] , or using a ''[[shocking grasp]]'' with his touch, the effects chosen freely from and switched between without limit; casting ''[[symbol of pain]]'' six times per day; ''healing'' himself or someone else thrice per day with his touch; ''[[true seeing]]'' for a cumulative 1-12 minutes, though ended if he used one of the above powers; radiating ''fear'' that effected anyone below the rank of duke; summoning 1-2 pit fiends with a six out of ten rate of success or 1-6 spinagons with a roughly two out of three rate.\n\n===Rimmon===\nRimmon was a general in the service of Asmodeus. Rimmon resembled a {{SI|12|ft|long=yes}} tall [[gelugon]] with a handsome and horned humanoid head. He was nasty, sarcastic, and disliked by other devils. However, he also had little personal pride and was loyal to Asmodeus.\n\nRimmon led five companies of gelugons into battle. In combat, Rimmon typically used his claws and tail as weapons, but occasionally he used a trident. As an archdevil, he possessed a number of innate magical abilities. He possessed [[infravision]] and could radiate an aura of ''[[fear]]'' at will. At will, he could replicate the effects of the spells ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[produce flame]]'', ''[[fly]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[detect invisibility]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[wall of ice]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', ''[[cone of cold]]'', ''[[lightning bolt]]'', ''[[teleport]]'', and fulfill another's (limited) ''[[wish]]''.

His scaly hide was crimson, with a jagged row of barbed spines running along his back that ended in a bony, spine-edged \"collar\" .He had yellow eyes with black pupils.\n\nZagum was a cold-blooded, ambitious, and intelligent devil who considered cruelty a self-indulgent waste of time. As a result, he had a rather coarse sense of humor in order to build positive relations with other devils and was always devising harmless and amusing stunts and jokes.\n\nZagum commanded 30 companies of hamatulas in the service of Asmodeus. He could summon 1-4 more of them to his side with a 3 out of 4 rate of success and had other supernatural abilities, such as minor regeneration and the power to cause ''fear'' by his gaze alone.  At will, Zagum could use ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[produce flame]]'', ''[[wall of fire]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[hold monster]]'', ''[[fly]]'', and ''[[teleport]]'', as well as being capable of using ''[[wish]]'' for another.

In his first form, Amduscias appeared as a dirty-yellow [[unicorn]] with a purple horn and eyes like flames. In his second form, he was an [[ambidextrous]] humanoid with a [[hawk]]-like head and long, hummingbird-like beak who typically dressed in black or dark-red robes (and might carry some form of treasure). His third form, the one he preferred to fight in, appeared as a [[wolf]] with a prehensile, serpentine tail. Regardless of his form, he did not wear armor.\n\nAs a general in the service of Tiamat, Amduscias led forty companies of [[abishai]],<ref group=\"note\">A great number of dukes in this article are described as leading great companies of devils in service to their masters, and while they still acted as generals, the [[Reckoning]] saw the vast majority of the armies of the Nine Hells placed under [[Bel]] and the [[Dark Eight]], and so these aspects of their descriptions are not necessarily up to or out of date. and could typically be found roaming [[Avernus]] and enforcing Tiamat's will. In addition to his long memory and cunning planning skills, he was a good negotiator and actor, hence his title of Reconciliator. Tiamat frequently employed him as a mediator for disputes between devils or her own kin. \n\nIn unicorn form, Amduscias attacked with his horn (which functioned similarly to a ''[[sword of wounding]]'') and hooves, and could bolt forward with surprising speed from a standing start (some said that Amduscias caused horses to spook or run uncontrollably). His humanoid form could wield two small weapons or fight with its terribly strong and sharp beak. His wolf form fought with its raking foreclaws, hindclaws, jaws and tail (which was strong enough to grip and slam his foes into other objects), and could fight with all its natural weapons simultaneously. Changing forms took a minute during which he could do nothing but speak, although in any form he could speak and understand any language perfectly in a way similar to use of the ''[[tongues]]'' spell. Other unique powers included causing ''[[fear]]'' in anyone close to him he pointed at, summoning one to three abishai at will, and casting ''[[find familiar]]'' on behalf of someone else to summon an [[imp]].",

The first was that of a muscular, dark-skinned humanoid{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|38-39}} When in this form, he typically wore black velvet robes studded with hundreds of [[gem]]stones, each worth a hundred [[gold pieces]], though he never wore armor. The second form was that of a large, [[crow]]-like bird, also black in color. Malphas's voice was deep and persuasive.\n\nAs a general in the service of Tiamat, Malphas commanded forty companies of abishai, and could typically be found roaming [[Avernus]] and enforcing Tiamat's will. Malphas was adept in the field of deception, particularly regarding non-devils. He generally tried to appear honest, and since he had no immediately obvious diabolic traits he could easily pass for an unusual [[human]]. No matter his form, he used a combination of ''tongues'' and ''[[detect thoughts]]'' to communicate with intruders, anticipate their questions, and provide answers that conformed to the expectations of whatever he was impersonating. He was among the archdevils able to use ''tongues'' to be so fluent in a language that it seemed to be his native tongue, and then use '''detect thoughts'' to seem like a member of a certain group, complete with passwords and secret signs gleaned as they were expected in the minds of his targets.\n\nMalphas possessed a number of innate magical abilities, including being able to cause fear at a touch and summon abishai to aid him. He could cast ''[[flame arrow]]'' on blades wielded by himself or others to turn them into ''[[flame tongue]]s'' and conjure a variant of ''[[Daern's instant fortress]]'', the difference being that the doors opened and closed for anyone and it disappeared according to his will or after around two to three hours elapsed. When fighting in human form, he used both his spell-like abilities and any type of weapon to fight.",

He typically wore flowing robes and always wielded an iron gauntlet, his badge of office, on his right hand.\n\nFocalor wielded much of the real power in Minauros, for Mammon was neglectful of its security, diplomacy, and administration in favor of hedonistic indulgence. The oft-silent Focalor was a master strategist, respectful, careful in word and deed, and took no risks with the security of the palace, or that of Glasya when she served as Mammon's consort. On the surface he seemed remarkably loyal, his allegiance having been tested several times in the past, and many archdevils thought that Mammon would be easy prey if not for Focalor's wisdom and the strength of his other few dukes.{{Cite dungeon/197/Codex of Betrayal: Glasya|3}}\n\nIn reality however, Focalor held his master in bitter contempt, resenting the foolish and craven Mammon for consistently neglecting his responsibilities, leaving him to deal with them. His true relation with Glasya was that of an informant and conspirator, for she appealed to his bitterness by promising to help him destroy Mammon. However, Focalor, did not want to take the position of archdevil himself. Rather he secretly plotted to force Bael into a position where he would have no choice but to overthrow Mammon, whereupon he would become the power behind the throne.\n\nFocalor possessed a number of spell-like abilities, most notably being able to control fish and summon storms (which resembled a combination of ''[[control wind]]'', and ''[[call lightning]]'') at will, though both abilities were ineffective while in Baator.

He hid his true feelings and chose to display an eager and active loyalty to Mammon, earning him Focalor's suspicions. The conspiratorial duke worked with Caarcinolas to engineer Bael's death in the hopes of ousting Mammon.\n\nMelchon led 18 companies of erinyes, fallen angels who refused to leave Mammon's service when Glasya left him.\n\nMelchon normally fought with a [[trident]] or two-handed [[axe]], neither of which were magical but which were always envenomed; he also used the sting on the end of his tail, which was likewise envenomed.

His most prominent facial feature was his large jaws, and his voice was described as having a hissing, soft, and menacing tone.\n\nMachalas had been the weakest of Geryon's three dukes in terms of both personal power and influence, and thus encouraged the feuding between Agares and Amon while taking neither side in order to make himself seem the most reasonable of the Wild Beast's vassals, and thus earn his favor. During that time he was known to command eleven companies of barbed devils at Geryon's direction.{{Cite dragon/361/Infernal Aristocracy: Dukes of Hell, Part II|31}}\n\nMachalas was a nimble flier able to fight with his jaws alone, but he usually wielded a ''+2'' [[axe]] or normal [[spear]] in combat.

He customarily wore a black tunic and breeches (the former of the two opening in the back to accommodate his wings), and a cape and hat of rich, blood-red silk.\n\nNeabaz was smoothly polite and visibly cold-blooded, treating all creatures with carefulness and civility out of the slightly paranoid concern that any creature he met could be an archdevil in disguise. As Baalzebul's herald he was rarely idle, but was also the only one within his court permitted to freely traverse the Hells. He enjoyed his work and respected his master, for his association with the Lord of the Flies provided him a station well above what he could achieve on his own. Back during the reign of [[Moloch]], it was he who usually delivered the Governor of Malbolge his marching orders, and he often received bribes from residents of that layer when they wanted something omitted or framed a certain way in a report. Besides bribes, he only carried treasures to accomplish Baalzebul's aims, and only under his explicit orders{{Cite dragon/91/Nine Hells revisited|27}}\n\nNoteworthy among Neabaz's personal powers were his abilities to freely ''cause fear'' in a short radius around him, ''[[slay living]]'' with his touch once per day, slowly regenerate from injury, and either summon a few osyluths or cornugons (which worked roughly half the time and was slightly less likely to work with the latter). However, despite these powers, and being fast on foot and twice as fast on wing, Neabaz was physically weak by archdevil standards. At best he could unfurl his proboscis and drain fluids from a living creature so long as he kept hold of the victim, his only other recourse being to unremarkably pound at them with fists.\n\nTo compensate for this deficiency, Neabaz was provided magical items by his master with which to defend himself, including his sword and cape, both allegedly sourced from the Material Plane. The sword was a ''+1'' [[flame tongue]] able to [[know alignment|tell the alignment]] of whatever it was pointed at and fire nine ''[[magic missile]]''s.

Armaros typically wore a leather tunic and belt, with many pouches to hold spell ingredients and scholarly materials.\n\nArmaros was not unhappy with his exile, as he cared only for his magical studies and sought only to further them. He spent his time roaming Avernus, typically pursuing his private obsession with [[magic]], and was known to appear without warning and use random creatures as tests for spells he was working on. Like other archdevils, he had no care for others and would carry out his experiments with calm detachment and even amusement, though he would also readily trade with creatures for more spells and magical knowledge. Of the other denizens of Baator, he respected and obeyed only Asmodeus, and was a favorite of the Dark Lord, free to do what he liked as long as he did not approach Tiamat or her generals, consorts, or armies, as well as those of visiting archdevils.\n\nArmaros was an exile for two reasons. The first was that he was a master dweomer-crafter and had made many of the Nine Hells' magical treasures. The second was that if he had a more powerful position—such as that of an archduke, as his personal power deserved—he would be capable of challenging Asmodeus. Additionally, Armaros had long-standing feuds with both [[Adramalech]] and [[Phongor]] that prevented him from serving in Asmodeus' court directly. So instead Armaros was exiled to Avernus, by Asmodeus' decree. The decree also stated that if any other archdevil were found to have communicated with him, that archdevil and his servants (even his entire court, in the case of an archduke) would be destroyed.\n\nArmaros was a master at spellcasting and [[spell]]-crafting; he had also made many [[magical item]]s for the devils.

However, his arrogance and rejection of what he deemed wrongful authority got him thrown out of two different dukedoms. When he was exiled, his name was changed from Hazzael to Azazel, to the mutual displeasure of both him and the [[List of demon lords#Azazel|demon lord of the same name]], by Asmodeus. The King of Hell had done so to stymie any attempts to summon Azazel by mortal summoners, as the method for summoning him had become widely known.\n\nAs an archdevil, Azazel could use a wide variety of magical powers at will, including being able to cause [[fear]] just by touching a creature.

She was a [[raven]]-haired beauty with several traditionally devilish features, including horns and a long, forked tongue, and clad only in blood-soaked, poison-slick chains which slithered around her like serpent. Upon closer inspection, the truth behind this oddity was clear, for as well as her infernal features, one would notice her mad eyes and voice like a withered crone.\n\nIt was not that Baelzra failed to inherit the hideousness of her parents, but that all her ugliness was internal, and in that she surpassed both her parents. From her camp on Avernus she secretly unbound souls from Hell with a dark [[yuan-ti]] ritual since, by her reasoning, if a soul was no longer damned, it would not belong to any archdevil by default, allowing her to effortlessly claim them. She grew bored without enacting violence for too long, fighting with terrible fury when wounded, and considered souls sweeter if given hope before having it crushed. Despite her exile and the fact that her harvesting activity would bring the ire of Bel or the Dark Eight, Mammon favored her criminal activity, both because he secretly profited and still doted on her.\n\nBaelzra wielded [[spiked chain]]s in combat, dancing across the battlefield and using them to ensnare targets or interpose others in her path.

In Avernus, he sought to create so much confusion amongst both devils and visitors alike that no one but he knew the true status of things. In the Material Plane, where he maintained some contacts, he was the root of much evil, being more active there than some archdukes. Cahor was a scheming, deceptive archdevil who was possessed of chaotic tendencies, for which he was much hated throughout [[Nine Hells|Baator]].\n\nWhen he still served in the diabolical hierarchy, Cahor was outwardly obedient to the archdevil commanding him, as long as that individual was present. Otherwise, he would act contrary to his orders; when questioned, he would provide plausible rationalizations. However, he would also issue orders to his underlings and later deny having done so. This combination of habits meant that no superior would entrust any task to him, and no underling would do a task for him, which resulted in him being effectively useless to the hierarchy, and likely earned him his exile.\n\nCahor was an archdevil and master illusionist, and thus possessed a number of magical powers.

Thrice each day he could use ''[[confusion]]'', and once each day ''[[paralyze]]'' by touch alone. Unlike other archdevils, he was unable to summon other devils to aid him. In actual combat, Cahor preferred to rely on his illusion magic and black [[iron]] [[javelin]]s, but would use a [[scimitar]] if forced into melee.",

He habitually wore a belt with pouches containing various things he found necessary.\n\nCaim was a duplicitous gossip and sneak and so was disliked throughout Baator.

            "Duskur": "Duskur, sometimes called the Dark Lady, was a strange and mysterious exile in Avernus. \n\nDuskur resembled a {{SIAdj|6|ft|adj=tall}} [[human]] female with snowy-white skin, long black hair, and solid black eyes. She was thin and moved gracefully. Duskur had smoky-grey and white bat-like wings that she normally hid beneath a sweeping, hooded cloak unless actually flying. Additionally, when she was heard singing, her voice was described as being high and fluting.\n\nDuskur was a mysterious she-devil who had been courted by more powerful archdevils, including Geryon and Belial, in the past; she had turned all her suitors down and consequently had no mate. In Avernus, she roamed the wastelands as an exile, surrounded by a small army of [[skeleton]] servitors that she had raised. Because of her status as an exile she avoided greater devils as much as possible and was therefore highly elusive.\n\nAs an archdevil, Duskur possessed a number of magical powers that she could use at will. Among these [[spell]]s, she could use ''bridge of fire'', which functioned similar to ''[[wall of fire]]'', but could be used as a solid bridge by Duskur and any creatures she was carrying; other creatures that attempted to use it passed or fell through. Additionally, her kiss could send a creature to [[sleep]]. In combat Duskur typically wielded an envenomed [[dagger]].",
            "Jaqon": "[[File:Jaqon.png|thumb|200px|right|''The archdevil Jaqon.'']]\nJaqon was an exiled archdevil who was trapped in Avernus.\n\nJaqon resembled a clean shaven [[satyr]] with red skin and green eyes. He also had pointed ears and small, curved horns like those of a [[pit fiend]]. He typically wore a weapon harness bearing a whip and rapier, and a [[backpack]].\n\nJaqon possessed an outlook typical of archdevils: the strong ruled and the weak obeyed. He was a skilled actor and diplomat when he needed to be. However, he also considered himself above the rulings and decrees of Asmodeus, and felt a sort of kinship with the archdevil Geryon and the rebellious pit fiends that dwelt on the edges of Cania.\n\nJaqon was originally an archdevil of [[Asmodeus|Asmodeus's]] court, serving the Lord of Nessus as herald and messenger. However, certain unpleasant activities of his led to his expulsion from the diabolical hierarchy and exile to Avernus. The activities that led to his exile included procuring substances from the Nine Hells at summoners' requests for a fee, giving information to summoners to aid in the summoning of other powerful devils, and giving hints at the truenames and preferences of various she-devils to the archdevils who sought their hands. For that last crime, all of the consorts in Baator despised him.\n\nTo make his exile a punishment, Asmodeus forcibly changed Jaqon's truename to Dagon—an insult to both the archdevil and the [[Dagon|demon prince of the same name]]. However, it was effective: anyone who tried to summon Jaqon would instead get the more powerful demon prince's aspect. It was an effective foil to an archdevil that was used to being summoned frequently. Trapped in Avernus by Asmodeus' decree, Jaqon was forced to roam that layer. He often pretended to be an unlucky woodland creature who was searching for a way \"home\" to the Material Plane. His immediate goals were to convince another creature, one that could leave Baator, to spread the word of his name-change and the means of summoning him again amongst summoners. To that end, he was polite and helpful.\n\nJaqon could fight with his bare hands, or with weapons such as a whip and rapier. Being an archdevil, he possessed a number of magical abilities. At will, he could use ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[produce flame]]'', ''[[wall of fire]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', ''[[wall of force]]'', ''[[charm monster]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[beguile]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[read languages]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[detect lie]]'', ''[[locate object]]'', ''[[obscure alignment]]'', and ''[[misdirection]]''.

His shoulders were bone-plated and spiked, and he had two pairs of arms set opposite each other: one pair faced forward, the normal way, and one pair faced backwards. Kochbiel had bright yellow eyes and a purple mouth and tongue.\n\nKochbiel spent his time roaming Avernus, avoiding large groups and any other devil or archdevil. He was said to spend much of his time exploring and possibly expanding subterranean areas, and also to have hidden large quantities of treasure within the most remote of his makeshift lairs. Kochbiel was known to be a rival of another exiled archdevil, [[Nergal (archdevil)|Nergal]], and the two would occasionally raid each other's lairs.\n\nKochbiel was once a general of Hell whose cold, calculating leadership and brilliant strategies won him many battles. He was very cunning and little escaped his notice. Unlike other devils, he never seemed to take pleasure in defeating others, but rather enjoyed in the strategy involved in such endeavors. Nonetheless, he still made many enemies in the Nine Hells. He was once a servant of the archdevil [[Beherit]], but was exiled when that archdevil was destroyed, as was still feared and mistrusted by other devils.\n\nKochbiel was a mighty fighter when in close combat, as he could use his four arms to strike at opponents both in front of and behind him. He could also use his tail to hold and constrict enemies. Additionally, Kochbiel was both prodigiously strong and known to heal quickly. As an archdevil, Kochbiel possessed a number of innate magical powers. He could use, at will, the [[spell]]s ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[produce flame]]'', ''[[wall of fire]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[push]]'', ''[[ice storm]]'', and ''[[wall of force]]''.

However, she was also sleekly muscled and possessed both [[vampire]]-like fangs and claws. Malarea normally wore some gaudy piece of jewelry.\n\nMalarea was variously described as fractious, bitter, envious, reckless, combative, and even manic, or berserk. She was prone to wild rages and vicious physical assaults and spent her time in exile roaming Avernus, attacking lesser devils and intruders. If she encountered a greater devil or archdevil, she would hesitate, but still attack unless the odds were impossible. She would also fly off if she encountered powerful resistance among other opponents.\n\nMalarea greatly desired to join the ranks of the consorts in the hierarchy, to the point of being willing to slay them all in order to do so. Her temperament had undoubtedly cost her her former position in the hierarchy of the [[Nine Hells]], as well as being the cause of her exile, yet she had learned little caution after various defeats following her typical boldly direct assaults.\n\nAs an archdevil, Malarea had several innate magical powers, being able to effects similar to the [[spell]]s ''[[pyrotechnics]]'', ''[[produce flame]]'', ''[[wall of fire]]'', ''[[detect magic]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[see invisibility]]'', ''[[hold person]]'', ''[[polymorph self]]'', and cause [[fear]], all at will. Additionally, she could cast ''[[delayed blast fireball]]'' three times a day. Malarea was a strong flier and was known to buffet enemies with her wings or even ram them in combat.

He had black feathers on his head and chest, yellow eyes, dusty-black skin, and bat-like wings. He also had a pair of up-swept spines on his elbows. Unlike many devils, he lacked claws. He had an eagle's eyes and preferred to observe rather than speak.\n\nNisroch was always polite, but cruel and mocking, and darkly humorous. He vastly preferred subtlety and subterfuge to direct confrontation, and would try to slay any creature that defied him. He enjoyed poisoning food and roamed Avernus making various poisons from the ingredients he could scavenge before poisoning corpses and other food sources to surprise the inhabitants of that place. He was once the poisoner of the Nine Hells, and his favored pastime was poisoning not corpses, but lavish feasts. However, he was banished after he destroyed the duke [[Senciner]] and came close to destroying the duke [[Abigor]].\n\nAs an archdevil, Nisroch naturally possessed a number of magical powers. He was also a master at the crafting and use of poisons. In combat, when he could not avoid it, Nisroch would use his beak, the talons on his feet,<ref group=\"note\">The source says that Nisroch has talons, but no talons on his hands, but also that he uses his talons in combat.

He had a bone-white, prehensile tail that split at the end into three barbed hooks.\n\nRumjal was a proud fiend who believed that he was a legitimate member of the diabolical hierarchy who had merely been displaced by a temporary fall from favor, and acted at all times as a loyal lieutenant of the Hells would. Tiamat and her dukes tolerated him more than the other exiles, as he would inform and physically aid them in thwarting the plots of [[Nergal (archdevil)|Nergal]] and various [[nycaloth]]s. He was known to be fond of art, wit, and poetry, and when dealing with most other devils was polite and good-natured, always treating them as equals. He was also a cruel prankster however, as well as bitter about his exile, and as an exile trapped in Avernus delighted in tormenting the least devils and intruders of that plane.\n\nRumjal was a lieutenant of Geryon before he was exiled for molesting his archduke's consort, [[Cozbi]]. It was said that Asmodeus liked Rumjal and did not wish for the lesser archdevil to be harmed, as it was known that prior to the latter's exile, Asmodeus enjoyed playing [[Chess (game)|chess]] with Rumjal.\n\nRumjal possessed a number of magical powers, as befitted an archdevil. Among other spells, he could use a ''ring of fire'' at will. That spell was like ''[[wall of fire]]'', save that Rumjal could throw, roll, or pick up the ring. His touch caused [[fear]] in other creatures. As with other exiled archdevils, he was incapable of summoning lesser devils to aid himself. In combat, Rumjal used his tail and other weapons, which he habitually kept covered in a venom that he alone produced. This venom was caustic, and Rumjal could spit it directly if needed; however, he only produced it in small quantities."

A possible solution to this contradiction might be in ''Manual of the Planes 4th edition'',  which mentions a pit fiend named Amon who acted as Levistus's seneschal, implying this may be a case of shared names. He resembled a {{SIAdj|9|ft|adj=tall}}, well-formed and muscled human with the head of a wolf.

His voice was soft and cultured; his arguments and advice generally at least sounded reasonable and sound. Gorson typically wore saffron robes and carried a scimitar.
