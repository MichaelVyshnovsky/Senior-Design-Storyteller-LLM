On the Feast of the Moon of the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR, this Thorn Tree disappeared hours before he was to perform the Bloodsong. This triggered a storm of controversy. First, there were rumors that the High Heralds had plans to expel Thorn Tree for corruption. Second, the rebel government of Riatavin had hoped to use the Bloodsong to assert their authority over the city amidst their secession from Amn to Tethyr. Third, some claimed that Thorn Tree had been working for, variously, Amn, Tethyr, the Knights of the Shield, or another faction of Riatavin. Thus, Thorn Trees disappearance was expected to be powerful political ammunition for all these factions, further disrupting the secession. In fact, Thorn Tree had actually been murdered by one of the Eldreth Veluuthra, and his body hidden so well it might never be found.\nCategoryMembers of the Heralds\n4tosroh4oen1ty8nhibzilt2ww5yq0n"
