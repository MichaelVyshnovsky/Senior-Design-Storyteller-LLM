'''Toroth''' was a noble family in [[Zhentil Keep]]. Around [[1258 DR]],<ref>Harlshoon died in 1258 DR according to p.28 of ''[[Ruins of Zhentil Keep|Ruins of Zhentil Keep (Campaign Book)]]'', so this date is based on this information. [[Manshoon]] requested the help of this family in order to avenge the death of [[Harlshoon]], his father. This resulted in the destruction of a Toroth villa, although Manshoon was pulled from the rubble and saved by his soon-to-be apprentice [[Sememmon]] (known as Malatar Wingstarl at that time).{{Cite dragon/357/Volo's Guide: Renegades of Darkhold|72}}
