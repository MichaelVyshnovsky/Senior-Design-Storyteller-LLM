A character kit or simply kit was an optional additional layer in character creation used in 2nd edition, allowing for a variety of subtypes within the usual character classes. Each kit provided a specific role and a set of requirements, limitations and benefits to give a character its own twist. Usually, these kits where specific to a character class.
The variation from the standard class a kit provided ranged from slight to very profound.
The Al-Qadim campaign required a kit for every character.
