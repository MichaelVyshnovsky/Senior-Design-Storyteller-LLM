The '''Living Jungle''' (LJ) was an organized play program run by the [[Role-Playing Group Association]] (RPGA) for the 2{{nd}} and 3{{rd}} editions of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' set in the rainforests of [[Malatra]].

{{Quote|''Far beyond the Living City lies an undiscovered land of savage tribes, fabulous creatures, and the mysterious ruins of a forgotten race. Soaring above the jungles of southern [[Kara-tur]], the Malatran Plateau has been invisible to the natives of [[Abeir-Toril]] for thousands of years. Most sages consider the area nothing more than an uninteresting wilderness.''{{Cite web/RPGA Living Jungle/Living Jungle}}|}}

==Description==
It was a spin-off of the [[Living City]] campaign and was coordinated by [[Kevin Melka]] and [[Dave Gross]]. The campaign was later taken over by [[Tom Prusa]], who was joined by [[Stephen H. Jay]], who went on to become Story Arc Coordinator.

==Gameplay==
Like other Living campaigns, the actions of the players affected the entire campaign. It differed from others, however, owing to the low-magic nature of the campaign and by emphasizing roleplaying over combat.

==History==
The Living Jungle survived briefly during the 3rd edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' but mostly used the 2nd edition ruleset. A total of eighty modules were published in all between February 1995 and August 2003.
