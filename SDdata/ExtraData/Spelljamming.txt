'''Spelljamming''', the use of [[spelljammer]] vessels for the exploration of [[wildspace]] and other worlds of the [[Prime Material plane]], was practiced by multiple peoples in several nations throughout the history of [[Toril]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Realmspace}}
The world of Toril was but one of several other worlds in the [[Realmspace]] crystal sphere. To the natives of [[Faerûn]], the wildspace above their heads was known as the Sea of Night. The two closest worlds to [[the sun]] in the middle of Realmspace were known as the [[Dawn Heralds]], and were barely visible only at sunset or sunrise. Beyond Toril, further out in the crystal sphere were the [[Five Wanderers]], five worlds that flowed through star-rivers in an uneven course through wildspace. Some of these worlds were inhabited by [[human]]s, [[dwarves]], and [[orc]]s, but also more sinister races such as [[illithid]]s and [[beholder]]s.

==History==
It was said that in the beginning [[Ao]] created a [[crystal sphere]] called the Sea of Night, which he created from the raw material of the [[phlogiston]], the material between crystal spheres. Within this realm drifted several lifeless worlds, and it was from the remains of this creation process that two twin beings formed, one of dark ([[Shar]]) and one of light ([[Selûne]]). These two beings set in motion a series of events that resulted in life on these barren worlds.

Exactly when the natives of Toril themselves began to traverse wildspace was unknown,{{speculation}} though for the elves it dated back to at least the era of [[Cormanthyr]].

[[Miirphys Irithyl]] (reign {{Yearlink|-1338}} to {{Yearlink|-791}}), an early coronal of the elven nation of Cormanthyr, was a supporter of the elven high mages' desire to launch more spelljammer ships. The [[High Magic]] ''elaorman'' ritual was often used in the construction of the elven crystalline spelljammer ships, and was a requirement in the construction of the [[Monarch armada|monarch]] spelljammer ships.

The reason that the elven high mages were so keen on creating more spelljammer ships was in order to counter the [[Netheril|Netherese]] expansion into wildspace. The Netherese had been dabbling and exploring Realmspace for a while. The elves suspected that the Netherese discovered the magic of spelljamming as early as {{Yearlink|-1114}}, though it was likely much earlier as the epic spell ''[[Proctiv's breach crystal sphere]]'' was created in [[-2051 DR|1808 NY (−2051 DR)]].

The Netherese mage [[Oberon (Netherese arcanist)|Oberon]] ({{YearlinkConvert|2839|NY}} to {{YearlinkConvert|2905|NY}}) was said to be the founder of Netheril's spelljammer industry, the "Father of Realmspace" (or so his followers claimed at least). Oberon was born into the shipbuilding industry, his father having been a shipbuilder before him, and he dutifully followed in his father's footsteps. Unlike him, though, he imbued his vessels with magic, and it was claimed that he led the other mages of Netheril into building spelljamming vessels. 

It really wasn't until {{YearlinkConvert|2795|NY}}, however, that the Netherese officially launched themselves into wildspace with serious intent.

However, the Netherese also found the expense of maintaining the docking stations and spelljammer ships too high and the danger too great, and they stopped all spelljamming activity in {{YearlinkConvert|2895|NY}}. The [[Elven Imperial Navy]], a conglomeration of elven interests in space, much bigger in scope than just Cormanthyr's spacefaring, was said to have constantly harried the Netherese as well.

During the [[Weeping War]] in {{YearlinkName|714}}, a series of short battles became known as the "[[Three Greenwing Wars]]" by the elves&mdash;named as such for their ally, an elven [[man-o-war]] ship. The Elven Imperial Fleet of Realmspace sent the ''[[Monarch Mordent]]'', a green-winged man-o-war spelljammer vessel captained by [[Oncith Ilbenalu]]. The ''Monarch Mordent'' provided heavy artillery and a crack crew of archers, [[bard]]s, and [[wizard]]s, which aided to briefly turn the tide of war in the northern forest. But in the last battle, the ship fell into the tree canopy below it. Its crystalline and photosynthetic wings continued to grow, however, and a large web of thin crystal grew to wrap around that part of the forest in what was later called the [[Monarch's Fall]] glade.

===Pre-Spellplague===
''Circa'' [[1367 DR]], the elves of [[Evermeet]] were said to have a half-dozen [[Ruathimaer]] ("starwing") spelljammer ships hidden in the [[Sumbrar]] fortress.

However, the real spelljammer powers on Toril were in [[Kara-Tur]]. Both the nation of [[Shou Lung]] and [[Wa]] were active in spelljamming.

===Post-Second Sundering===
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a few rare [[mind flayer]] colonies still had their spelljamming vessels (the [[nautiloid]]s), but had lost the secrets of manufacturing them. They kept their existence hidden and only used their ships in case of emergency, in fear of being detected by [[Gith (race)|gith]] hunting parties.
