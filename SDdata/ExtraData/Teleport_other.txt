Teleport other was a psionic science of the psychoportation discipline that allowed the psionicist to instantly transport another person to a location they knew well.
The psionicist needed to be familiar with the desired location, even if this was only through the use of other psionic powers. This power only worked on willing targets, instantly transferring them to the location with a slight audible pop of sound. Up to three targets could be teleported in this manner at a time. A greater expenditure of psychic energy was needed to teleport targets over greater distances.
* Vhondryl, a psionicist in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor
