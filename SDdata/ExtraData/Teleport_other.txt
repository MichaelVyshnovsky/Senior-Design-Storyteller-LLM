}}'''''Teleport other''''' was a [[psionic]] science of the [[psychoportation]] [[discipline]] that allowed the [[psionicist]] to instantly transport another person to a location they knew well.

==Effects==
The psionicist needed to be familiar with the desired location, even if this was only through the use of other psionic powers. This power only worked on willing targets, instantly transferring them to the location with a slight audible pop of sound. Up to three targets could be ''teleported'' in this manner at a time. A greater expenditure of psychic energy was needed to ''teleport'' targets over greater distances.

==Notable Users==
===Individuals===
* [[Vhondryl]], a psionicist in [[Skullport]] and head of the [[Hall of Mental Splendor]]{{Cite dragon/172/Seeing the Sights in Skullport|12, 14, 88}}
