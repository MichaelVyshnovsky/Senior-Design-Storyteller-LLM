{{Otheruses4|[[spirit]]s that resided within the natural world|the similar but distinct spirits of [[Kara-Tur]]|nature spirit (Kara-Tur)}}
'''Nature spirits''', also known to some as '''primal spirits''', were incarnations of the [[Toril|natural world]] that were linked to specific natural features or locations in the [[Prime Material plane]]. They varied greatly in appearance and power. Some [[spirit]]s were diminutive in size and might—often called upon for aid by travelers in wilderness―while others were venerated as [[demigod|semi-divine]] beings or even [[god]]s unto themselves.

{{Quote|Respect the spirits of your home, for they guard the land when you sleep.|The 4{{th}} law of the [[Rashemaar]] people.}}

==Description==
Nature spirits appeared as manifestations of geographical features found within the world of [[Toril]]. Some spirits encompassed a only a single rock or tree, while others were the drawn from an entire desert oasis or a looming mountain. The most powerful nature spirits appeared as manifestations of whole island chains, large enough to house an entire kingdom.

They took on varying [[humanoid]] forms, appearing as children, or even monstrous aspects of nature come to life. In some cases they manifested as fearsome animals.

==Powers==
Spirits of nature held varying levels of omniscience over the natural land with which they were connected.''[[Dragon magazine 373]]'' refers to the gods' relationship with "the Astral". Considering the primordial s originate the Elemental Chaos, nature spirits originate from the world, the gods would share a similar relationship with their domains in the Outer Planes.{{Cite dragon/373/The Primal Power Source|66-69}}

==Society==
Nature spirits were known to appear to many groups of peoples all across Toril. They were venerated by the [[grippli]] of the [[Sword Coast]] as well as the [[Korobokuru]] people,{{Cite dragon/404/Ecology of the Hengeyokai|1}} and were known to bestow spellcasting powers to the [[Chultan dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Chult]]. 

It was possible for nature spirits to mate in a way with [[human]]s, though it was an ancient practice. The descendants of this historical dalliance between entities were known as [[spirit folk]].

==Relationships==
Nature spirits were venerated by individuals that were bonded to the natural world and tapped into [[primal magic]]. They often granted powers to  [[druid]]s, [[barbarian]]s,{{Cite dragon/376/Realmslore: Sarifal|61}} and [[shaman]]s alike. Some druids were even capable of themselves transforming into nature spirits.

Lesser nature spirits could be summoned by means of the ritual, ''[[call wilderness guide]]''.

===Place Magic===
{{Main|Place magic}}
Spellcasters from certain locales across Toril were capable of drawing upon the powers of nature spirits to cast [[arcane magic]] as well. Practitioners of [[place magic]] held strong bonds to their homeland and the spirits within. They could tap into [[the Weave]] without having prepared and memorized spells beforehand. The [[Wychlaran]] of [[Rashemen]] were among the most famous practitioners of place magic.

==History==
According to one legends, these spirits first appeared in the natural world during the [[Dawn War]], when the gods and [[primordial]]s engaged in a terrible battle that raged across the [[multiverse]].

==Locations==
Nature spirits were more often encountered in secluded locales of natural beauty and primal power. Notable among these locales were [[Immil Vale]], the [[Ashenwood]] and [[Urlingwood]] forests in [[Rashemen]], the oases of [[Anauroch]], the [[Hordelands]],{{Cite dragon/404/Character Themes: Fringes of Kara-Tur|1}} and numerous locales across the continent of [[Kara-Tur]].

The [[Moonshae Isles]] and the Hordelands were among the locales where the worship of nature spirits was most prevalent.

==Varieties==

[[Wild elves]] worshiped the six known nature spirits [[Bear (nature spirit)|Bear]], [[Eagle (nature spirit)|Eagle]], [[Raven (nature spirit)|Raven]], [[Wolf (nature spirit)|Wolf]], [[Coyote (spirit)|Coyote]], and [[Snake (spirit)|Snake]] as lesser deities.

====Kara-Turan Spirits====
{{Main|Nature spirit (Kara-Tur)}}
Nature spirits in [[Kara-Tur]] comprised two aspects of morality, both [[good]] and [[evil]]. These aspects regularly existed in harmony until one became coerced into dominance by some outside force.

====Place Spirits====
{{Main|Place spirit}}
Place spirits were semi-divine entities of [[Anauroch]] worshiped by the native [[Bedine]] tribes. Each spirit was linked to its own 'place of power' and held distinct power and sentience within its borders.

====Nine Trickster Gods====
{{Main|Nine trickster gods}}
These primal spirits arose from the Jungles of [[Chult]], after [[Ubtao]] abandoned his homeland. Over time they became worshiped as gods by the people of [[Omu]], and grew mischievous and even malicious in nature. The spirits of these "trickster gods" were defeated and imprisoned by the [[lich]] [[Acererak]] and buried in the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]. Some decades later, the trickster gods had regained some of their former power and were able to influence mortals once more.
