        "Plot Overview": "The story is set in Lolth-worshiping drow society, primarily Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders. In the prologue of ''Dissolution'', the first novel in the series, Lolth wraps herself in a cocoon, leaving all her worshipers on [[Toril]] unaware of what might have befallen the demon goddess. All of her priestesses, including the highest-ranking [[matron mother]]s, lose their divine magical abilities, which in turn causes a series of events that shake the very foundations of drow society.<ref>",
