The eclipsed moon coin of Silverymoon is the large coin in the center.\nSilverymoon was one of many large cities that minted its own coinage. Its coins were considered among those of the highest quality in the Realms.\nThe standard Silvaeren-minted coins were the following, in order of decreasing value\n* Platinum piece (pp) \"unicorn\"\n* Gold piece (gp) \"dragon\"\n* Electrum piece (ep) \"sword\"\n* Silver piece (sp) \"shield\"\n* Copper piece (cp) \"glint\"\nIn addition to these coins, Silverymoon also minted the crescent-shaped electrum \"moon\",Page 20 of the 5-edition Dungeon Masters Guide instead states that a moon is worth 1 gp within the city and 1 ep elsewhere.\nBy 1372 DR, the city also minted a golden version of the moon that was valued at 2 gp within the Silver Marches and 1 gp outside the Marches.\nFinally, Silverymoon also minted a larger, round coin called the \"eclipsed moon\". This coin was made by fusing a shining blue crescent \"moon\" with a darker piece of silver.Page 20 of the 5-edition Dungeon Masters Guide instead states that the eclipsed moon is worth 5 ep within Silverymoon and 2 ep elsewhere, as it was originally.\nDespite minting its own coins, Silverymoon accepted all of the common and some of the less common coins and trade bars used in the Realms. Ancient dwarven coins from the ruins of Delzoun were generally not accepted at full weight by the merchants of the city, however, as they were considered cursed."
