The [[eclipsed moon]] coin of [[Silverymoon]] is the large coin in the center.'']]\n\n[[Silverymoon]] was one of many large cities that minted its own '''coinage'''. Its coins were considered among those of the highest quality in the Realms.\n\nThe standard [[Silverymoon|Silvaeren]]-minted coins were the following, in order of decreasing value:\n\n* [[Platinum]] piece (pp): \"[[unicorn (coin)|unicorn]]\"\n* [[Gold]] piece (gp): \"[[Dragon (coin)|dragon]]\"\n* [[Electrum]] piece (ep): \"[[sword (coin)|sword]]\"\n* [[Silver]] piece (sp): \"[[shield (coin)|shield]]\"\n* [[Copper]] piece (cp): \"[[glint]]\"\n\nIn addition to these coins, Silverymoon also minted the crescent-shaped electrum \"[[Moon (coin)|moon]]\",Page 20 of the 5{{th}}-edition [[Dungeon Master's Guide 5th edition|''Dungeon Master's Guide'']] instead states that a moon is worth 1 gp within the city and 1 ep elsewhere.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], the city also minted a golden version of the moon that was valued at 2 gp within the Silver Marches and 1 gp outside the Marches.\n\nFinally, Silverymoon also minted a larger, round coin called the \"[[eclipsed moon]]\". This coin was made by fusing a shining blue crescent \"moon\" with a darker piece of silver.Page 20 of the 5{{th}}-edition [[Dungeon Master's Guide 5th edition|''Dungeon Master's Guide'']] instead states that the eclipsed moon is worth 5 ep within Silverymoon and 2 ep elsewhere, as it was originally.\n\nDespite minting its own coins, Silverymoon accepted all of the common and some of the less common coins and trade bars used in the Realms. Ancient dwarven coins from the ruins of [[Delzoun]] were generally not accepted at full weight by the merchants of the city, however, as they were considered cursed."
