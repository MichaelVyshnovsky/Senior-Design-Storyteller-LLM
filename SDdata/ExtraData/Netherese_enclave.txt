An '''enclave''' was a magical city or castle built by the [[Netherese]] during the time of [[Netheril]], and most famously referred to the flying cities built in the dozens that floated above [[Faerûn]] until they fell during [[Karsus's Folly]].

Although shearing off a mountaintop and using it as the base for a city was a (relatively) convenient solution, many enclaves were raised before the invention of ''[[Proctiv's move mountain]]'' and utilized other techniques. Even after its development, the exclusivity of the spell and the desire of Netherese archwizards to prove themselves meant that many pursued divergent techniques that may have been more difficult or less effective, and as a result each enclave had its own unique appearance.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-09-17 - Diverse Netherese Enclave Design}}

While visually impressive, severing a mountaintop was not particularly productive, as the tips of mountains were often made up of heavily weathered, fissured layers of rock that did not hold together well on their own. As a result, that technique would require additional work to fully stabilize. Although Netheril was dotted with flat-topped mountains, most were actually the result of extensive mining and quarrying that simply reduced them to plateaus, rather than a grand spell that levitated the tops off.

One common technique for the creation of a flying enclave was the laying of cottage-sized boulders as a foundation, that were then magically melded into each other and sculpted into more elaborate forms.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/07-17 - Netherese Enclave Building Techniques}} Another popular style involved creating an enormous ''[[wall of force]]'' that acted as a platter that carried the requisite structures.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/07-23 - Netherese Enclave Errata}}

Other forms of magically-supported cities and outposts also existed. The [[Sargauth Enclave]] used its ''mythallar'' to support the underground space it was inside, while the cities of [[Werapan]], [[Cuulmath]] and [[Quaeluuvis]] were underwater constructions, shielded by huge crystal domes.

==History==
The earliest forms of the flying enclave came after the [[arcanist]] [[Ioulaum]] invented the ''[[mythallar]]'' in {{yearlinkConvert|845|NY}}. Using the great powers available, arcanists were able to levitate single buildings atop tiny islands of rock, gravity-defying sculptures, and elaborate artistic installations that flowed through the air.

The first true flying enclave was raised in {{yearlinkConvert|866|NY}}, [[Xinlenal]], also created by Ioulaum. This prompted many ambitious arcanists to create their own, leading to many diverse designs as they tried to outdo each other and claim a place of prestige.

The process was later revolutionised by the development of the [[epic magic]] [[spell]] ''Proctiv's move mountain'' in {{yearlinkConvert|1746|NY}}, which cut the top off a mountain, flipped it over, and floated it through the air so they could build a city on the flat surface.

The vast majority of remaining enclaves were destroyed as one during [[Karsus's Folly]] in {{yearlinkConvert|3520|NY}}. Their flight was broken and they crashed to the ground, often killing all within. Only a few enclaves survived, including [[Hlondeth]], [[Asram]], and [[Anauria]], which crash-landed intact, and [[Thultanthar]], which escaped into the [[Shadowfell]].

As a result of their far-flung explorations, many flying enclaves did not come to a rest within the traditional bounds of Netheril.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-09-16 - Netherese Enclave Diaspora}} This included [[Ythryn]] in the [[Reghed Glacier]], [[Arongahurr]] near [[Yal Tengri]], [[Telarrzhard]] in the [[Yehimal Mountains]], and [[Urvraunt]] on the edge of the [[Yellow Sea]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-02-13 - Far-Flung Netherese Enclaves}}{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-07-18 - Locations of Far-Flung Enclaves}}
