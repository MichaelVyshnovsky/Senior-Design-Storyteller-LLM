===Fluffgrass===
Fluffgrass grew in the more fertile areas of the [[Serpent Hills]] in clumps. They could grow as tall as {{SI|4|ft}} and late into the spring season they would produce feathery white flowers.

===Spidergrass===

===Thrusk===
Thrusk was a very tough variety of wild grass. Much like a fern this type of grass grew in tufts from long, underground roots, which allowed it to survive high temperatures and long droughts. It had a ropy, bitter taste to it that was not unlike licorice. Horses, livestock, and other pack animals were known to graze upon it. Both the leaves and root of this variety of grass could be boiled to brew a [[Thrusk (drink)|drink of the same name]].<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2009)/Thrusk}}
