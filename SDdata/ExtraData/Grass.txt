Grass was plentiful in many varieties in the Forgotten Realms.
Barley was a type of grass cultivated for a cereal grain.
Bluegrass grew in the midwood and starwood areas of the forest of Cormanthor.
Chaunteas Token was a unique variety of grass that was sacred to the goddess Chauntea.
Crabgrass grew in the rimwood area of the forest of Cormanthor and in the storm giant aerie atop Lake Woe mountain.
Fluffgrass grew in the more fertile areas of the Serpent Hills in clumps. They could grow as tall as  and late into the spring season they would produce feathery white flowers.
Grab grass was a species of grass that typically grew in the Feywild, but could also be found in areas on the Prime Material where the Feywilds magic filtered through.
Peppergrass grew in the rimwood area of the forest of Cormanthor. In the past, a blaze caused by fyrefly activity incinerated all of the peppergrass east of Hap.
Quack grass grew in the rimwood area of the forest of Cormanthor. It has become an alternative food source for the fyreflies.
Spidergrass grew out of tiny cracks in rock walls throughout the Serpent Hills, spreading tendrils across several feet. These tendrils would often dig deep into cracks and grow their own satellite plants, making it not uncommon for a patch of spidergrass to cover several s of territory.
Thrusk was a very tough variety of wild grass. Much like a fern this type of grass grew in tufts from long, underground roots, which allowed it to survive high temperatures and long droughts. It had a ropy, bitter taste to it that was not unlike licorice. Horses, livestock, and other pack animals were known to graze upon it. Both the leaves and root of this variety of grass could be boiled to brew a drink of the same name.
Wiregrass grew in clumps on hillsides in the rimwood area of the forest of Cormanthor.
Zebra grass grew in the starwood area of the forest of Cormanthor.
