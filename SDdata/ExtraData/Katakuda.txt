Katakuda, also known as dragonskin, was a drug that originated somewhere in the lands of Kara-Tur.
In its usable form, the drug appeared as a brown paste that was applied directly on the skin.
A single dose cost 100 gp in Faer√ªn, after it was imported from the east.
When applied, katakuda hardened the users skin for a duration of a half hour. After that time, the users muscles went into spasms, causing incredible pain.
Developed by an order of monks, the substance greatly increased the amount of punishment they could receive in battle and was only used when the most dire of battles were expected.
