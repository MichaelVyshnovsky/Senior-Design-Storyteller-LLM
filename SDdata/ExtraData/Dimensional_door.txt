'''''Dimensional door''''' was a [[psionic]] devotion of the [[psychoportation]] [[discipline]] that allowed the [[psionicist]] to open a portal leading to another dimension.

==Effects==
The [[human]]-sized shimmering portal created by this power allowed the psionicist to step through and appear anywhere within {{SI|150|feet|long=yes}} through another portal. The portals would remain as long as the psionicist expended psychic energy. The portals could only be used from a single side, allowing up to five individuals to step through at a time.

Stepping through a ''dimensional door'' was disorienting, dazing travelers and preventing them from performing complex tasks for a minute after traveling.
