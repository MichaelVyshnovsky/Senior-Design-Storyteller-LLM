Universal spells could be learned by all Zakharan [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]] and [[elemental mage]]s, no matter their specialization. The universal province is not to be confused with the much narrower range of [[universal spell]]s that were not considered part of any of the nine (or eight) [[schools of magic]] distinguished by [[Faer√ªn]]ian magic-users.",
