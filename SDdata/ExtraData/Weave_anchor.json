        "History": "Creation of the anchors was imposed upon Mystra by [[Ao]] the overgod, in order to keep the goddess's power in check and to increase the stability of the world.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-06-19 - Origin of the Weave anchors}}\n\nIn the {{yearlinkName|1487}}, High Prince [[Telamont Tanthul]] began a campaign to seek out the weave anchors of [[Faer√ªn]], in order to drain their energy and aid [[Shar]] with her efforts to destroy the Weave.\n\nThat same year, [[Storm Silverhand]], [[Elminster Aumar]], and his granddaughter [[Amarune Whitewave]] traveled across the [[Western Heartlands]] seeking out lingering magical [[ward]]s, so that they could help create new ones and strengthen the Weave. Ultimately, Elminster joined [[Laeral Silverhand|Laeral]] and [[Alustriel Silverhand]], along with the [[Srinshee]] to destroy the anchor at [[Myth Drannor]] to prevent it from being corrupted and keep safe the city's people.",
        "Abilities": "Weave anchors stabilized the Weave around them, causing [[antimagic field]]s, [[dead-magic zone]]s, and disjunction effects (like ''[[Mordenkainen's disjunction]]'') to fail around them.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-05-29 - Effects of the Spellplague}}{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-08-30 - Accessing magic without the Weave}}\n\nWeave anchors kept a connection to the Weave even when they left [[Realmspace]],{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-07-04 - Elminster accessing magic on Earth}} allowing Mystra to communicate with them and to see through them. They also had a tendency to live longer than the usual lifespan of their kin, and to escape death against the odds.\n\nIt was possible to create new weave anchors at locations that had been magically [[ward]]ed.",
        "Known Weave Anchors": {
            "People": "* The [[Chosen of Mystra]]: Many of the anchors were Chosen of Mystra, and some of them were able to manipulate the Weave directly, without the need for [[arcane magic]].\n* [[Volothamp Geddarm]]: Volothamp had no knowledge of being an anchor, but still received the associated benefits.\n* [[Elminster Aumar]]\n* [[Storm Silverhand]]\n* [[The Simbul]]\n* [[Manshoon]]\n* [[Mirt]]\n* [[Durnan]]{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-06-08 - About Durnan}}\n* [[Halaster Blackcloak]]\n* [[Ana Brabener]]",
