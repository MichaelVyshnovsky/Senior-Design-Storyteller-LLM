Such entities served to stabilize the Weave should anything happen to the goddess.\nCreation of the anchors was imposed upon Mystra by Ao the overgod, in order to keep the goddesss power in check and to increase the stability of the world.\nIn the , High Prince Telamont Tanthul began a campaign to seek out the weave anchors of Faer√ªn, in order to drain their energy and aid Shar with her efforts to destroy the Weave.\nThat same year, Storm Silverhand, Elminster Aumar, and his granddaughter Amarune Whitewave traveled across the Western Heartlands seeking out lingering magical wards, so that they could help create new ones and strengthen the Weave. Ultimately, Elminster joined Laeral and Alustriel Silverhand, along with the Srinshee to destroy the anchor at Myth Drannor to prevent it from being corrupted and keep safe the citys people.\nWeave anchors stabilized the Weave around them, causing antimagic fields, dead-magic zones, and disjunction effects (like Mordenkainens disjunction) to fail around them.\nWeave anchors kept a connection to the Weave even when they left Realmspace, allowing Mystra to communicate with them and to see through them. They also had a tendency to live longer than the usual lifespan of their kin, and to escape death against the odds.\nIt was possible to create new weave anchors at locations that had been magically warded.\n* The Chosen of Mystra Many of the anchors were Chosen of Mystra, and some of them were able to manipulate the Weave directly, without the need for arcane magic.\n* Volothamp Geddarm Volothamp had no knowledge of being an anchor, but still received the associated benefits.\n* Elminster Aumar\n* Storm Silverhand\n* The Simbul\n* Manshoon\n* Mirt\n* Durnan\n* Halaster Blackcloak\n* Ana Brabener\n* The Athora in Thay\n* Candlekeep The Weave once anchored to the keeps Great Shield.\n* The Moonwells\n* Some mythals, including that of Myth Drannor.\nCategoryMagic\nCategoryMagical locations\n3j0bzgy1wx3p5h33a898pfojxr8jzkx"
