The extent of his influence on the more distant parts of his realm, however, often remained in doubt.\nThe Grand Caliph in 1367 DR was Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir, the 18 bearer of the title and direct descendant of the first Grand Caliph, an al-Badia boy who found the teachings of the Loregiver and united all lands of Zakhara under the banner of Enlightenment more than 500 years earlier.\n* 1 First Grand Caliph (c. 800 DR)According to the source, the reign of the first Grand Caliph ended \"more than five centuries past\", but began some \"six centuries ago\", before the current time of the setting.\n* 2 Nasir al-Nasr\n* 15 Akbar al-Assad\n* 16 Bahamal al-AssadNo dates are given for Bahamals reign, but it is known that he was in power in 1327 DR.\n* 17 Achmed al-Assad (until c. 1345 DR)\n* 18 Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir (from c. 1345 DR)\nThe title of Grand Caliph was also assigned to Arash bint Sanjar, responsible for the Scouring of the Utter East in 657 DR, long before the advent of Enlightenment, by Mar historians.\nThe mighty ruler of the djinn, Husam al-Balil ben Nafhat al-Yugayyim, bore the similar-sounding but distinct title of Great Caliph."
