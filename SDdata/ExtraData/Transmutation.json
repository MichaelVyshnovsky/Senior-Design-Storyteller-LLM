They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the casters command, or enhance a creatures innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injuries. The school was previously known as alteration. The transmutation school had no subschools. A wizard who specialized in transmutation was known as a transmuter.\nTransmutation spells included bulls strength, cats grace, bears endurance, foxs cunning, owls wisdom, eagles splendor, and the various polymorph spells.\n* Safiya\n* Samas Kul\n* CategoryTransmutation spells\n* CategoryTransmuters\nCategorySchools of magic\nCategoryMagic\n3evgfyz1x3z5wcawe81u6su1ezq99nf"
