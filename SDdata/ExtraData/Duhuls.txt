'''Duhuls''' were small fissures in the ground that led to natural pools of water. Most of these fissures were located along the hillsides of the [[Pit of the Ghuls]] near the western tip of the [[Mountains of Forgotten Dreams]], in the [[High Desert]] of [[Zakhara]].

Water was always scarce within the High Desert, so local nomads fiercely guarded duhuls that they claimed. A nomad claimed a duhul by etching his personal mark into the stone entrance. These nomads could usually be persuaded to allow others to use their duhul if given a gift or half of whatever amount of water was extracted.

==Description==
Duhuls could range as far as 200 feet (60 meters) before leading to water and were no larger that 4 feet (1.2 meters) in diameter. Travelers braving the tunnels often had to deal with bites from ants or beetles, and nasty scrapes from the sharp rock surfaces.
