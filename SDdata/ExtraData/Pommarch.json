By 1492 DR, the Cyricist Nashivaar family of Esmeltaran maintained the seat of Pommarch within the council.\nThe Pommarch was responsible for managing Amns vast amount of exported goods, perhaps the most time-consuming responsibility held by any members of the council. They fashioned trade agreements with other nations and maintained the safety of Amns trade routes. Along with the Namarch, the Pommarch established trade tariffs and set tax and exchange rates throughout the country.\n* Phaan Colwyvv (1333 DR - 1345 DR)\n* Wulver Xornnag (1345 DR - 1362 DR)\n* Tyrda QHelvor (1362 DR - ?)\nCategoryTitles\nCategoryAmnian titles\nhl9d3r5z3zbcesg0jxaw5575p8730kp"
