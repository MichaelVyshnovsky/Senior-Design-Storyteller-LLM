A game was played for at least three or four rounds but could go much longer if the two competitors were equally matched.\nThe reaction of the audience determined the winner, and particularly creative or witty insults were preferred. Singdowns were used to resolve minor disputes, so that violence could be avoided.\nCategoryGames (in-universe)\n79sghzjbnh65m6z7xix791e3jkmddw0"
