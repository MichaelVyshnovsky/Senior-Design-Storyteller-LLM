        "Description": "A huuk was a battle of wits; it was essentially an exchange of sung insults between two parties.",
        "Rules": "An insult was only \"valid\" if it followed these three \"rules\":\n* It must be sung;\n* It must begin with the phrase, \"My friend,\" either in second or third person; and\n* It must either compare the opponent to bad food or comment on the opponent's temper.\n\nThe competition was played in rounds, with each opponent taking a turn to offer an insult, while the audience listened. A game was played for at least three or four rounds but could go much longer if the two competitors were equally matched.",
        "Result": "The reaction of the audience determined the winner, and particularly creative or witty insults were preferred. Singdowns were used to resolve minor disputes, so that violence could be avoided.",
