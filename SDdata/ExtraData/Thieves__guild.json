Most major cities in [[Faerûn]], and some smaller ones, had one or more thieves' guilds. Some were powerful enough to hold significant political power, which they often obtained through bribery and intimidation. Most local guilds were short-lived groups that revolved around a particular individual.\n\nMembers of thieves' guild often served one of the following roles, which were divided into divisions in larger guilds: assassins, beggars, bounty hunters, burglars, con artists and tricksters, cutpurses and pickpockets, enforcers and thugs, racketeers, scouts and spies, and fences, smugglers, and pirates.",
