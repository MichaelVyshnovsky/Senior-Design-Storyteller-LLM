Steal This Hook! was a series of web articles written first by Doug Beyer and then by Robert Wiese on the [https//dnd.wizards.com/ Dungeons & Dragons] website published monthly (initially twice-monthly) from September 2004 to May 2009. It presents a variety of plot hooks and adventure ideas, first for the Eberron setting but later also for the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Ravenloft, and d20 Modern settings. With the transition to 4 edition, Nentir Vale was included.
For completeness, all articles are listed below, with only those articles with content intended for the Forgotten Realms having citation links.
