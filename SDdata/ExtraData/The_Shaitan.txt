The Shaitan was a name given in the Desert of Desolation area of Raurin to bizarre, possibly magical storms.
The Shaitan always moved west to east across the desert, and only occurred during daytime. Though it moved too fast to get out of the way effectively, it carried a miles-tall cloud which could be seen for an hour before it arrived, even at ground level. The air became cold for miles around the cloud, from which strong winds issued it was difficult to see even a mile within five miles of it, and within two miles visibility was reduced to a hundred yards.
People caught within the Shaitan proper found that it had two forms one of an acid storm, and one of a dust storm. Being inside the cloud during a dust storm, the most common kind, eliminated almost all visibility acid storms were slightly less common and caused actual damage to flesh for up to ten minutes, requiring all people and livestock to take cover.
