}}'''''Elemental Evil Player's Companion''''' is a supplement for ''[[Princes of the Apocalypse]]''. It was designed for the 5th edition of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', set in the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'', and released in 2015.

{{quote|'''''Create Heroic Characters to Conquer the Elements!'''''

''In the adventure ''[[Princes of the Apocalypse]]'', the cosmic threat of [[Elemental Evil]] reaches the Forgotten Realms. This supplement provides new options for player characters in that epic campaign. Not inherently [[evil]], elemental power can be mastered by those with both malevolent and benign intentions. The Elemental Evil Player's Companion provides everything players need to build a character that is tied directly into the Elemental Evil storyline.''

''New race options include the [[aarakocra]], [[deep gnome]], [[genasi]], and [[goliath]]. Additionally, a plethora of new [[spell]]s put the elements directly at your command.''}}
