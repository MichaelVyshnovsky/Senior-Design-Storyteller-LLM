They were common and effective for their cost, finding use by kobolds, [[orc]]s, [[goblin]]s,\n* Alarms caused a [[bell]] or similar device to produce a great amount of noise, alerting nearby defenders, but did nothing else to impede invaders.\n* Pits used the simple force of gravity to cause a damaging fall. They were usually disguised with a collapsing floor or trapdoor that allowed the victim to walk into it unawares, but even an open pit could cause invaders to shy away, or simply let them be pushed in the old-fashioned way. The impact itself could harm or kill the victim, but secondary traps such as spikes at the bottom of the pit were popular. A pit could also be filled partway with water and then stocked with carnivorous fish or other creatures.\n* Separation traps used a moving wall or gate to corral and separate groups of invaders. Once they entered, they could not leave, allowing them to be handled by defenders or a secondary trap system.\n[[File:Melee traps.jpg|thumb|150px|''Melee traps included spring-loaded spikes and swinging blades.'']]\n* Melee attack traps involved some direct harm being visited upon the target such as [[spike]]s or blades being thrust upon them. More elaborate \"attacks\" involved whole walls or ceilings moving to crush everything within a chamber, complex arrays of blades, and large boulders set rolling down a narrow hall.\n* Ranged attack traps used missiles like [[dart]]s, [[arrow]]s, [[bolt]]s, and [[spear]]s launched from a distance. The simplest required manual reloading, but more advanced types used automatic mechanisms.\n* [[Poison]] made an excellent addition to a trap, or a trap on its own. Spikes and darts could be envenomed for additional effect, while some contact poisons could be used to make something as innocuous as a doorknob a threat.\n* Hobbling traps were designed to cause lasting impediment to the victim, usually by injuring their feet. These could be dedicated mechanical contrivances, or common [[hunting trap]]s and [[caltrop]]s that could be quickly deployed.\n* Tripping traps aimed to simply lay the victim low for a moment. These could be tripwires, [[ball bearings]], [[rope]]s, [[chain]]s, or anything else that caused someone to lose balance and be at a disadvantage.\n* Ensnaring traps used [[net]]s and snares that pinned the victims in place temporarily. The webs of giant spiders and similar creatures could also fulfill this role.\n* Collapsing traps used an unstable natural or artificial ceiling, wall, column, or other architectural feature as the weapon, or a mass of similar heavy materials. When triggered, they would fall upon the victims, burying them in rocks, [[brick]]s, masonry, or timbers.\n* Gas traps used poisons and toxic chemicals to fill a small space, causing choking, blindness, or suffocation. [[Burnt othur]],{{Cite dragon/45/Gas 'em up and Smoke 'em Out|6,7}}\n* Dust traps used some kind of powder, [[sand]], or other fine material to fill the air. These could temporarily blind someone by getting in their eyes, hang in the air and block lines of sight, or cause suffocation. They were most popular among creatures that did not depend solely on sight, such as [[grimlock]]s and dragons. They could also involve powdered toxins that worked on inhalation or skin contact.\n* Light tricks were a sort of trap used to misdirect and lure foes. This involved a source of light such as a campfire or bonfire being set that implied the presence of people, such as a campsite. The fire-setters would await nearby, allowing potential threats such as bandits or monsters to be drawn in by the obvious light source and investigate the false camp. This allowed the fire-setters to plan an ambush or some other response.\n* Flood traps involved sealing the invaders inside a chamber, then rapidly filling it up with water or some other drowning liquid.\n* In addition to being used as lures into other traps, valuable or useful-seeming weapons could also be trapped directly. They could be given a contact poison on the handle, or have a more complex mechanical setup that caused it to disintegrate when used in a serious situation, or spring back and strike the wielder.\n* Plants, fungi, that did not move or intentionally attack could make useful low-maintenance traps. Flora such as [[brown mold]] and [[green slime]] not only looked innocuous, but could easily slay an unprepared wanderer.": "==Magical Traps===",

            "Spoiler Traps": "[[File:Caltrops2e.png|thumb|300px|''The secrets of caltrop use, revealed.'']]\nCertain traps could be thrown down near-instantly, most often used by [[rogue]]s trying to spoil a pursuit:\n* [[Aniseed]] could be placed to distract guard [[dog]]s, potentially taking care of them for hours.\n* [[Caltrop]]s were spiky implements dropped en-masse, covering a wide area with foot-impaling threats.\n* [[Catstink]], an alchemical compound that could be used to distract guard dogs more effectively than aniseed.\n* [[Marbles]] and ball bearings could be scattered on the ground to make it difficult to run across.\n* [[Snaptrap]]s were tiny jaw-traps that could be thrown down by the hundred, covering an area with traps that would snap shut on feet.",
            "Hunting Traps": "Hunters, foresters, and other folk in the wilderness often used traps and snares to catch wild game. These were quite small and simple constructions that ensnared game with [[rope]] or dropped them into a pit. Snares intended for humanoids and other intelligent prey were also called \"man-traps\", and were much more elaborate and lethal, making use of spikes, springboards, and deadfalls to kill or incapacitate a potential target.\n\nA common [[hunting trap]] was a pair of saw-toothed steel jaws with a pressure plate, [[chain]]ed to a secure anchor. When weight was placed atop the trap, it would snap shut and bite deeply into the victim.\n\n[[Fowler's snare]]s let a small bird be captured unharmed inside a cage. [[Lobster]] and [[eel]] traps were common implements that let a fisher place them and come back to the results.",
            "Dungeon Traps": "[[File:Feeding Chute Trap Dungeonscape.jpg|thumb|250px|''A self-cleaning trap design.'']]\nA more dramatic use for traps was in the small-scale, high-stakes endeavours faced by [[adventurer]]s as they delved into ancient ruins and enemy strongholds. These traps tended to be much more complex than those used by hunters to catch game, potentially involving intricate mechanical devices laid out over an entire area or structure with the intent of halting dangerous and (sometimes) intelligent intruders. While some traps were plainly designed to automatically kill invaders, most were intended to slow them down or drain their resources while the defenders responded.\n\nThe emplacement of long-term traps in a dungeon or other structure required them to not adversely affect the inhabitants who were ostensibly protected by them. Most importantly for an inhabited area, they needed to not get in the way of or be triggered by the defenders as they moved around both in day-to-day business and during combat situations. Active defenders needed to be completely aware of the locations and effects of their traps and how to best make use of them during a conflict.\n\n* Death traps were the most lethal traps, and often the most expensive and complex. Because of their utility they were best used near the entryway to ensure their usage and not waste the lives of the defenders.\n* Softening traps were intended to weaken and tire intruders by without the expectation of slaying them. They worked best when the defenders could actively harass the attackers and keep up constant pressure along with the traps, preventing them from resting or gathering their wits.\n* Combat traps worked best when triggered at the start of or in the midst of combat. They were not particularly dangerous in of themselves, but temporarily distracted or disabled the intruder and allowed defenders to take the advantage in combat.\n* Pursuit traps were intended to be blundered into while the defenders acted as bait, or placed along the defender's vital escape routes. They were best at slowing down and harming intruders that were rushing forwards without as much care.\n* Testing traps were open challenges to intruders. They were intended to overtly test the worthiness of the intruder and give them a fair chance to escape or bypass the threat, according to whatever standards the maker had.\n* Ejection traps moved the victims to a different location, such as to just before other traps that had already been bypassed, or out of the dungeon entirely.\n* Alteration traps were not a threat in of themselves, as they simply changed the layout of the dungeon by opening or closing passages. This could prevent entry (or escape), corral the intruders into a new path, or unleash guardian monsters.",
            "Natural Traps": "Most natural traps were simply dangerous areas that occurred on their own. These included [[quicksand]], [[tar pit]]s, sinkholes, unstable rock walls and ceilings, collapsing architecture, deep pools of water, and other hazards. These were likely to be the only \"traps\" present in uninhabited locations like natural caverns.\n\nSome creatures created their own snares and traps that they used for defending their lairs or catching prey:\n* [[Giant ant lion]]s dug pits that prey could fall into instead of actively hunting. The latter would further seal the fate of prey by flapping their wings to cause the pit to collapse.\n* [[Blackspawn stalker]]s, [[ettercap]]s, [[giant spider]]s, used webbing to trap their prey (as did smaller, less dangerous spiders).\n* [[Giant sundew]]s remained still while spreading their tendrils out, then ensnared prey that came too close.\n* [[Korred]]s were known to weave their magical hair into all manner of entangling ropes and snares, which some left lying around the perimeter of their glens as a defensive measure."

And Kurtulmak's prospective priests had to make their way through a trap-filled corridor as a final test of initiation.\n\nSome martial gods, though lacking traps as part of their portfolios, had clergies that regularly dealt with them. [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]]'s clergy kept themselves alert of the latest developments in traps,<ref><ref> the clergy of [[Arvoreen]] often constructed or reviewed traps as part of their efforts in defending [[halfling]] communities,<ref> and temples of [[Haela Brightaxe]] always featured at least one highly destructive trap to keep their goods out of the hands of enemies to the dwarven people.<ref>\n\nPreference in trap types tended to vary among races. [[Elves]] generally preferred weaving efficient magical traps into their tombs, foregoing extended gauntlets or false tombs. Some surface elves even constructed magical entrapments for [[aquatic elves]], who usually opted for net traps and spring-propelled booby-traps, hidden amongst [[coral]] reefs or beds of [[seaweed]]. Most [[dwarves]] put their trust into mechanical traps to safeguard tombs. One exception to this was [[wild dwarves]], who instead of stonework and mechanical contraptions relied upon traps suitable to the jungles of [[Chult]], such as deadfalls, pits, and snares.<ref><ref><ref> Much was the case with other intelligent races that inhabited the outdoors of Faerûn, such as [[lizardfolk]].<ref>\n\nIn the [[Xedran Reefs]], every city, town, and temple outpost of the [[ixitxachitl]] nation was outfitted with trap-ladden passages.<ref>",
        "Notable Traps": {
            "Dragon Traps": "The lairs of [[dragon]]s and those who worshiped them often featured a variety of distinct traps found nowhere else:\n* The lairs of aquatic dragons, such as [[black dragon|blacks]] and [[green dragon|greens]], commonly featured a flooding trap in conjunction with the spell ''[[summon monster V]]''. Once the trapped chamber was flooded, the spell would summon a [[fiendish creature|fiendish]] [[giant crocodile]].\n* ''[[Baleful polymorph]]'', attached to ''[[detect good]]'' as a proximity trigger, was placed on gems or other portable items to be inserted amongst a dragon's horde as a nasty surprise for would-be thieves. When triggered, the trapped object would disappear and the recipient of ''baleful polymorph'' would turn into a harmless animal, usually a [[toad]] or lizard.\n* One common form of trap involved a pair of enspelled carvings, made to resemble the heads of [[white dragon]]s. These were to placed facing each other, usually protruding from a wall or tunnel. With ''detect good'' as a proximity trigger, these heads would unleash ''[[cone of cold]]'' whenever a [[good]]-aligned individual passed between them.\n* Some lairs trapped objects with ''[[flame strike]]'', attached to the spell ''[[deathwatch]]'' as a proximity trigger, so that the enspelled object would only go off on those who were severely wounded.\n* The ''[[fleshshiver]]'' spell was commonly placed upon piles of bones that had valuable-looking gems hidden amongst them to lure in thieves.\n* Some dragons attached to gems or other treasures an effect similar to the ''[[imprisonment]]'' spell, which upon triggering would make the trapped object disappear and send those who touched it to a prison deep beneath the earth.\n* The [[Church of Tiamat]]  closely guarded the secret of using the spell ''summon monster V'' to conjure one form of [[abishai]] every time spells of a particular [[school of magic]] were cast within the enspelled area; any abishai conjured by this trap could not summon other [[baatezu]]. These traps ranged as follows: [[black abishai|black]] on [[conjuration]] and [[necromancy]] spells, [[blue abishai|blue]] on [[divination]], [[green abishai|green]] on [[abjuration]], [[red abishai|red]] on [[transmutation]], and [[white abishai|white]] on [[enchantment]] and [[illusion]] spells.\n* Similarly, the Church of Tiamat closely guarded the secret of using the spell ''[[summon monster VII]]'' to conjure a [[krathbairn]] every time an [[evocation]] spell was cast within the enspelled area; any krathbairn conjured by the trap could not summon more of their kind.\n* A common dragon lair trap, particularly among [[red dragon]]s, was to use ''summon monster VII'' in conjunction with a well-camouflaged pit trap. Upon any creature reaching the bottom of the pit a fiendish [[megaraptor]] would be conjured.\n* A trap unique to [[shadow dragon]] lairs was to have a doorknob, flanked by two statues of [[half-dragon|half]]-shadow dragons, with the one on the right laced with [[shadow essence]]. If the doorknob was turned to the right, it would cause the head on the corresponding statue to bend and bite the hand on the knob.\n* Temples dedicated to [[Tiamat]] often featured a trapped altar. These altars would hold a reservoir of [[dragon bile]], which would pump it out through tiny holes drilled into the altar, dousing anything nearby."

Even simple illusions such as ''[[illusory wall]]'' and ''[[silent image]]'' could create dangerous obfuscations.\n* ''[[Leomund's trap]]'' made an object seem as if it were lethally trapped to magical and mundane senses, causing an intruder to waste time and resources dealing with it, or scaring them off.\n* ''[[Mordenkainen's faithful hound]]'' provided a magical invisible guardian that defended an area.\n* ''[[Snare]]'' caused a loop of rope or vine to tighten around any limb placed within it.\n* ''[[Stone trap]]'' rendered {{SI|1|cubic foot|long=yes}} or more of stone, such as boulders, invisible and then kept them levitated. Upon a specific phrase being uttered, or specific conditions being met, the stone would become freed from its mid-air location and turn visible as it fell. Some skilled dwarves would fashion false ceilings of smooth-finished stones for the purpose of this spell, even carving carved ornamentation like vault arches or gargoyle-heads to further sell the illusion. The spell was most often used above strategic areas, such as archways and vault doors.<ref>\n* ''[[Symbol]]'' spells provided various deadly and incapacitating effects, including ''[[Symbol of death|death]]'', ''[[Symbol of fear|fear]]'', ''[[Symbol of weakness|weakness]]'', ''[[Symbol of stunning|stunning]]'', ''[[Symbol of sleep|sleep]]'', ''[[Symbol of persuasion|persuasion]]'', ''[[Symbol of pain|pain]]'', ''[[Symbol of insanity|insanity]]''.\n* ''[[Trap spellbook]]'' produced an effect similar to ''explosive runes'', causing a large explosion upon anyone who opened an enspelled [[spellbook]] other than its owner.\n* ''[[Trip]]'' caused a mundane object to hover slightly in position to trip a target that passed over it.\n* The ''[[waves of exhaustion]]'' spell was commonly used as a trap in dragon lairs, usually enspelling two objects or areas that were opposite of each other in order to confuse and weaken treasure seekers.\n* [[Curse]]d [[magical item]]s could be intentionally left where looters could find them, allowing the intruders to pick them up and suffer the consequences.\n\n[[File:Annihilation Mouth Dungeonscape.png|thumb|250px|''Sometimes nothing at all could be an effective trap.'']]\nMany magical traps used a discrete magical device, which could usually be re-used:\n* A ''[[mirror of life trapping]]'' was a powerful magical item that could pull an unsuspecting victim into a [[demiplane]].\n* A ''[[net of entrapment]]'' or ''[[net of snaring]]'' could be used to entrap someone who passed nearby.\n* A ''[[rug of smothering]]'' or ''[[rug of welcome]]'' could be used to restrain and smother an unwanted visitor.\n* A ''[[sphere of annihilation]]'' could be left in a spot where intruders could stumble upon it unawares, and let its mere presence finish them off."
