The '''Chosen of Bane''' was a position granted by [[Bane]] to powerful members of his faith. Typically, there was only one Chosen of Bane at a time.

==History==
Around [[1372 DR]], this position was held by [[Fzoul Chembryl]].

Around [[1492 DR]], this position was held by [[Enver Gortash]], who collaborated with the [[Dead Three]]'s other chosen, [[Orin]] and [[Ketheric Thorm]] to cause the [[Absolute crisis]].<ref>

==Powers==
Bane granted a number of spells and powers to his chosen. They gained ''[[endure elements]]'', ''[[mind blank]]'', and ''[[negative energy]] protection'' as bonus spells, and the ability to use ''[[command]]'' and ''[[enthrall]]'' as they willed; ''[[hypnotism]]'', ''[[remove fear]]'', or ''[[cause fear]]'', five times a day; ''[[charm monster]]'' and ''[[suggestion]]'' three times a day; and ''[[dominate monster]]'' and ''[[geas]]'', once a day. They also took less damage from attacks, and they could not age, either naturally or as a result of magic. They could also summon [[death tyrant]]s and let their shadows roam free through a telepathic link. Finally, a chosen had greater force of charisma and was more wise.
