The '''Meisarch''' was the highest-ranked member of the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]], and later the [[Council of Five (Amn)|Council of Five]], the ruling body that governed the nation of [[Amn]] during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. They were the speaker of both councils, its highest seat and undisputed authority in all collective decision-making. By [[1479 DR]] it was openly controlled by the noble [[Selemchant|House Selemchant]].

==Responsibilities==
The Meisarch was responsible for the internal defense of the nation with regards to adventurers and [[mage]]s. They closely observed the activities of unsanctioned adventurers and, by means of the [[Cowled Wizards]], unlicensed [[arcane]] [[spellcaster]]s. With regards to the economy of Amn, they ensured that no one business, merchant family or other entity (including the council's own) created a monopoly in any trade or commercial enterprise.

When issues that required an official vote came to the council and they arrived at an impasse, the Meisarch could cast a tie-breaking vote.

==Members==
* [[Thayze Selemchant]] (1333 DR â€“ [[1362 DR]])
* [[Erlranther Alibakkar]] (1362 DR - ?)
