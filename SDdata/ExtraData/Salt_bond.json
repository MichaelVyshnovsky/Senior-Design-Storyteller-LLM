Salt bonds typically lasted for three days, during which the host assumed full responsibility for the guest's welfare. Guests under protection from a salt bond also agreed that no harm should befall the host as well, either by themselves or any member of their family.<ref> In fact, many Zakharans honored salt bonds long after the three day period ended, extending courtesies when the two parties met elsewhere in the future.",
