Salt bonds typically lasted for three days, during which the host assumed full responsibility for the guests welfare. Guests under protection from a salt bond also agreed that no harm should befall the host as well, either by themselves or any member of their family. In fact, many Zakharans honored salt bonds long after the three day period ended, extending courtesies when the two parties met elsewhere in the future.\nCategoryRituals\nkrdu8svlqzd0mmfl27bapqqz8p1vx6p"
