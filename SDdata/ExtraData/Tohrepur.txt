'''Tohrepur''' was a ruined city in the Mere-That-Was region of [[Akanûl]]. The city formerly sat on the shores of the Akanamere but when the [[Spellplague]] dried up the lake, the waters receded and the city was left beyond the waters reach. The [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] destroyed Tohrepur in [[1473 DR]] and turned its residents into [[aberration|aberrations]]. Tohrepur was then the home of a plaguechanged [[Sirine]] who was worshiped by a cult known as [[The Choir]].
