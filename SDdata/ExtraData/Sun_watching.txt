'''Sun watching''' was a religious skill used by the [[Azuposi]] people of the [[Pasocada Basin]] of [[Maztica]].

==Description==
Only the Azuposi [[sunwatcher]]s, special [[priest]]s dedicated to appeasing the mighty sun [[spirit]] [[Sun Father]], practiced sun watching. Sunwatchers used this skill to understand specific dates with regard to the sun's position compared to known landmarks. Knowing the correct date ensured the sunwatcher could perform the appropriate ritual or ceremony for that precise time of the year.

The basic concepts behind sun watching could also be used with the [[Selûne (moon)|moon]] and stars.
