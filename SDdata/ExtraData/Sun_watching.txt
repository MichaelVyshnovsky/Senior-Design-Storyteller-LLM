Sun watching was a religious skill used by the Azuposi people of the Pasocada Basin of Maztica.
Only the Azuposi sunwatchers, special priests dedicated to appeasing the mighty sun spirit Sun Father, practiced sun watching. Sunwatchers used this skill to understand specific dates with regard to the suns position compared to known landmarks. Knowing the correct date ensured the sunwatcher could perform the appropriate ritual or ceremony for that precise time of the year.
The basic concepts behind sun watching could also be used with the moon and stars.
