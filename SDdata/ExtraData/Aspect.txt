An aspect was an alternative form of a powerful extra-planar being such as deity, primordial, or even a demon lord. The concept of divine aspects was referred to as the Plurality of Being.
A deity or primordial may have had multiple aspects, and some of these aspects were different from each other. Deities could have multiple aspects in one or more pantheons, as worshiped by multiple different races.
For those deities worshiped across multiple planets, each local aspect was different from its other iterations.
Mortals of monotheistic faith may have focused worship on only a specific aspect, or multiple aspects, of their chosen deity. 
Some people were unfamiliar with the concept of divine aspects may not have acknowledged divine beings from other pantheons, unaware that deities were a member of the pantheon they worshiped.
Followers of the Adama believed that the myriad gods of the known pantheons were all aspects of the One.
* Aerdrie Faenya was considered to be an aspect of Akadi.
* Bes of the Mulhorandi pantheon was considered to be as aspect of the dwarven god Vergadain.
* Entropy, an aspect of the dragon goddess Tiamat.
* Ghaunadaur, the Elder Elemental God, was worshiped as an aspect of Juiblex solely within Realmspace.
