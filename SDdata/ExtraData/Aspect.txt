An '''aspect''' was an alternative form of a powerful extra-planar being such as [[deity]], [[primordial]], or even a [[demon lord]]. The concept of divine aspects was referred to as the '''Plurality of Being'''.

==Description==
A deity or primordial may have had multiple aspects, and some of these aspects were different from each other. Deities could have multiple aspects in one or more [[:category:pantheons|pantheons]], as worshiped by multiple different races.

For those deities worshiped across multiple [[:category:planets|planets]], each local aspect was different from its other iterations.

==Relationships with Worshipers==
Mortals of monotheistic faith may have focused worship on only a specific aspect, or multiple aspects, of their chosen deity. 

Some people were unfamiliar with the concept of divine aspects may not have acknowledged divine beings from other pantheons, unaware that deities were a member of the pantheon they worshiped.

==Perspectives==
Followers of the [[Adama]] believed that the myriad gods of the known pantheons were all aspects of [[Adama#Tenets|the One]].
