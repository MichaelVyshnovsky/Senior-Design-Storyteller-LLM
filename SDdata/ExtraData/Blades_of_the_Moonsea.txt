The '''Blades of the Moonsea''' series by [[Richard Baker]] is a trilogy of novels that follow a few years of the life of [[Geran Hulmaster]], a thirty-something [[swordmage]] who returns from a decade of adventuring to find his home of [[Hulburg]] being taken over by those not native to the town.

The novels take place primarily between mid-Eleint of [[1479 DR]] to mid-Ches of [[1480 DR]], though there are occasional flashbacks to Geran's earlier history. The epilogue takes place a little less than a month after the events of the final novel.

The novels include:
* ''[[Swordmage (novel)|Swordmage]]'' (May, 2008)
* ''[[Corsair (novel)|Corsair]]'' (November, 2009)
* ''[[Avenger (novel)|Avenger]]'' (November, 2010)

The artwork of the cover was provided by [[Raymond Swanland]].
