        "mainbody": "Barkskin was a druid evocation and a transmutation or alteration spell that toughened the skin to a bark-like consistency. \nBarkskin toughened the skin of the creature touched, giving it natural armor. In general, the quality of the armor improved the higher the casters power. The barkskin evocation drew upon the casters constitution for the strength of the armor&mdasha tougher caster could bestow tougher armor. The spell would not stack with any other effect that increased natural armor.\nThe post-Second Sundering version\nIt was recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy text of the church of Mielikki."
