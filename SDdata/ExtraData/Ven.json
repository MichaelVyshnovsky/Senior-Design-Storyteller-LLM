Each Ven served for a 10-year term, in which their word was law, though unpopular Ven tended to die prematurely. Strangely, the true identity of the Ven was kept secret throughout their reign it was an odd arrangement but apparently worked well for Tsurlagol.\nThe spokesperson of the Ven was the Vens Voice, who served as their chief advisor and announced the Vens decrees to the people of Tsurlagol. However, the Voice was often more powerful than the Ven.\nCategoryTitles\nCategoryMembers of the Council\nquzt5wp8o69c8l2rz9olavicgrse7pz"
