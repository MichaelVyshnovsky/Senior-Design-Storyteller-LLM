Each Ven served for a 10-year term, in which their word was law, though unpopular Ven tended to die prematurely. Strangely, the true identity of the Ven was kept secret throughout their reign; it was an odd arrangement but apparently worked well for Tsurlagol.\n\nThe spokesperson of the Ven was the [[Ven's Voice]], who served as their chief advisor and announced the Ven's decrees to the people of Tsurlagol. However, the Voice was often more powerful than the Ven.",
