The '''Night Helm''' is a [[magic|magical]] [[helmet]] supposedly created centuries ago by [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] himself for the King of [[Cormyr]].  The helm protects the wearer from any mind affecting [[spell]] and from [[scrying]].  The helm was kept in the [[Kings Tower]] in [[Marsember]] to be used by an Obarskyr on the run.  In [[1479 DR]] the helm was stolen by the [[Death knight]] [[Targrael]] in an effort to shield her from [[Manshoon|Manshoon's]] scrying.
