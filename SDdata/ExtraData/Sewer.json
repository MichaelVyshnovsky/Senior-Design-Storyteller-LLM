These were essential to most large civilized settlements, as not disposing of wastewater could create a breeding ground for diseases.\nSewers were often dug and constructed as cities were planned and built. In the case of rather older cities, sewers may have been excavated after their street layouts were already in place.\nSome cities sported sewers that were, in part, the repurposed structures of older cities they were built atop of. Such examples of this included the former city of Sarbreen beneath Ravens Bluff and the former deep gnome city that Calimport stood atop of.\nThe simplest form of sewer system consisted of various drains and grates&mdashlocated in streets, alleyways, and some homes&mdashthat emptied directly into an underground river or cistern. The next step up from that were sewers consisting of stone halls, large enough to allow for maintenance, featuring clay or metal pipes. These could become rather mazelike and confusing to navigate.\nCities that stood close to rivers or tidal bodies of water often chose to design their sewers to operate on a tidal flushing system. This meant they utilized their nearby source of moving water, diverting it so as to flush local wastes away to elsewhere. This was often the cheapest & easiest route for such cities to take, but it could cause problems for those downstream from them.\nIn order to prevent severe clogs, many sewer systems installed screens across their channels to \"catch\" large debris, which would then be cleared and have their debris taken to the surface by city workers. Sometimes these screens had spikes jutting out, which served to both catch more debris and dissuade those illicitly traversing sewers from getting up close to the screens and tampering with them, such as with things like acid or files.\nWhen such screens were installed throughout much of a sewer, they had the effect&mdashfrom the point of view of those who regularly traversed sewers&mdashof dividing it into segments.  With city crews working on particular segments and criminals finding them to be frustrating barriers to what would otherwise be an ideal covert highway.\nIn most cities in the Realms, buildings had indoor toilet rooms that connected to the sewers. In the case of grand houses and castles, these toilets were known as garderobes. In most other cases, toilets were known by the less formal name of \"jakes.\" Outdoor toilets were known variously as gloryhouses, thunder thrones, and privies.\nThose indoor rooms typically consisted of a toilet seat with a gravity drop pipe descending beneath it. Nearby would be a wiping cloth for users, to be washed for later use, as well as large jugs of water with which to wash and flush down waste.Comparing this to real world plumbing, a \"turn-the-balun\" connection means that if water ever rose up the pipe, it would activate a floater connected to the lid, which in turn would push the lid closed. Otherwise known as a \"float valve,\" this innovation developed by Burlan Almaether made it so that if liquid levels in an enclosure ever reached a certain point, the flow of water would be shut off, thus protecting cellars from sewers backing up.\nTypically, outdoor privies in the Realms did not connect to the sewers, but in certain cities a direct connection was oftentimes the case.\nSewers often had a strong stench within them, making it difficult for many creatures to smell much of anything,\nIn areas where there was poor ventilation, pockets of methane gas were likely to form from the waste in sewers.\nthumb|300px|Venturing into a sewer was often a bad idea for the unprepared.\nAll of the cities on the continent of Faerûn that were noted as having sewers were as follows\n Alaghôn, Alamontyr, Ankhapur, Archenbridge, Athkatla, Berdusk, Bezantur, Blackbarn, Calaunt, Calimport, Elturel, Elversult, Hlondeth, Innarlith, Ithmong, Phoenix, Ravens Bluff, Riatavin, Saradush, Shoonach, Silverymoons Northbank district, Skuld, Soorenar, Suzail, Tantras, Thentia, Tilverton, Urmlaspyr, Waterdeep,\nIn the land of Zakhara, the city of Huzuz was known to have a sewer. On the continent of Laerakond, the cities of Harglast and Tarmalune had sewers. And though not a city, the fortress of Candlekeep also had a sewer.\nSome drow communities in the Underdark were known to have sewers, but these were never large or extensive and their waste always flowed directly to fungus beds, which in turn fed upon the sewage. The subterranean city of Skullport also sported an extensive system of sewers, originally constructed by the Netherese as part of the Sargauth Enclave. Beyond Toril itself, sewers could be found on a number of worlds, including Eberron and Oerth.\n* Sewers of Ankhapur\n* Sewers of Archenbridge\n* Sewers of Athkatla\n* Sewers of Baldurs Gate\n* Sewers of Calimport\n* Sewers of Elturel\n* Sewers of Hillsfar\n* Sewers of Hlondeth\n* Sewers of Luskan\n* Sewers of Mulmaster\n* Sewers of Neverwinter and its subsection, the Blacklake Sewers\n* Sewers of Procampur\n* Sewers of Ravens Bluff\n* Sewers of Selgaunt\n* Sewers of Skullport\n* Sewers of Suzail\n* Sewers of Tantras\n* Sewers of Tilverton\n* Sewers of Waterdeep\n* Sewers of Westgate\n* Underscar, the sewer system of Helms Hold\nGeneral History\nOver the course of Torils history, sewer systems were developed for various settlements by dwarves, halflings, and in rarer cases enterprising humans and elves. But over the course of centuries it was rock gnomes, more than any other race, who became specialized in designing, repairing, and perfecting the sewer systems of large mixed-population cities. Though the average human citizen was likely unaware of the gnomish oversight involved in their sewers.\nSpecific History\nThe existence of sewers on Toril dated as far back as the city of Memnonnar, which was established by the Great Pasha Memnon in approximately .Dates are approximations based on the arrival and binding of Memnon.\nCenturies later, sewers were constructed in southeast Faerûn in the cities of Medinat Muskawoon and Phoenix as well as in northwest Faerûn by the elven kingdom of Earlann, within such cities as Ascalhorn and Myth Glaurach, followed by the Netherese Empire.\nIn the millennia since Memnonnar was founded, sewers continued to be constructed for cities within the Lands of Intrigue,\nDuring the time of the Shoon Imperium, most of the cities in the Lands of Intrigue that were under its rule possessed sewers, including its capital Shoonach. When Strohm I led an assault on the city in the , he had many of his forces enter Shoonach through its sewers.\nIn the , a period known as the Silence of Lolth caused such an upset in drow society that many fled to either the Upperdark or Lowerdark. Those who fled to the latter depths displaced the rylkar, a rat-like species known to only a few Underdark experts. Forced into moving to higher subterranean depths, the rylkar began infesting sewers across the Interior and Western reaches of Faerûn, being reported in such places as Waterdeep and the kingdom of Cormyr. Posing a significant threat, adventurers across the land banded together to eradicate the infections. However, the rylkar proved to be quite adaptable, continuing to seemingly build colonies just as few as they were destroyed.\nthumb|250px|Dangerous beasts lurk in the sewers...\nMuch of the wildlife in cities were relegated to sewers, wherein they were likely to become exposed to various illnesses and sometimes become transmitters of them. The creatures that were most often found to be lairing within sewers on Toril included chuuls, the extaminaars, meazels, giant crocodiles, various varieties of oozes, most notably cesspit oozes, rylkars,In the Baldurs Gate series of games, one of the interactions that can occur between companions Edwin and Minsc is the former asking derisively what species of rodent Boo is, naming such possibilities as wharf rats, voles, and \"Perhaps the sewer-dwelling city weasel?\" Its uncertain whether this last line is meant to be taken as a joke or a factual statement that weasels can be found in the sewers of the Sword Coast. But most of all rats and giant rats.\nthumb|300px|...just waiting to strike!\nThe sewers of some of Faerûns most ancient cities, such as that of Skuld, were haunted by ephemeral swarms. And in addition to animals and monsters, the moist, dark environment of sewers made them an excellent space for fungi to grow.\nWhen it came to the humanoids that inhabited cities, the destitute and criminal elements of society were likely to hide in the sewers, hide the bodies of their victims, or make a home for themselves. Beggars often knew how to navigate sewers. And criminal elements such as outlaws, smugglers, thieves, and outcasts often hid within sewers of the cities. In some cases even building their own societies. Sewers were also popular hiding spots for cults to outlawed deities, such as Moander.\nthumb|250px|A trio of adventurers traverse the sewers, clearly unsettled by the smells down there.\n* Sometimes city officials hired adventurers,\n* All across Toril, city sewers were often utilized by great thieves guilds.\n* The three largest rock gnome clans known for their expertise in sewers were the Barbellows, the Narlens, and the Thallows.\n* The Church of Gonds techsmiths were known to build small golems tasked with taking care of unsightly municipal duties, such as caring for large sewer systems.\n* In urban areas, the Church of Malar sometimes held holy hunts within sewers.\n* The Church of Moander often constructed temporary shrines to him within sewers, as well as temples out of forgotten areas of sewers.\n* Many clerics of the Church of Shaundakul sold accurate-as-possible maps of short underground routes, such as sewer systems.\n* The Church of Silvanuss clerics, in the Vilhon Reach region, often provided magical support free of charge to the cities in which they resided.
