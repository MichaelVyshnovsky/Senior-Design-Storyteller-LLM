The next step up from that were sewers consisting of stone halls, large enough to allow for maintenance, featuring [[clay]] or metal pipes.

        "History": ";General History\nOver the course of Toril's history, sewer systems were developed for various settlements by [[dwarves]], [[halfling]]s, and in rarer cases enterprising [[human]]s and [[elves]]. But over the course of centuries it was [[rock gnome]]s, more than any other race, who became specialized in designing, repairing, and perfecting the sewer systems of large mixed-population cities. Though the average human citizen was likely unaware of the gnomish oversight involved in their sewers.\n;Specific History\nThe existence of sewers on Toril dated as far back as the city of [[Memnonnar]], which was established by the Great Pasha [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]] in approximately {{Yearlink|-6800}}.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Year\">Dates are approximations based on the arrival and binding of [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]].\n\nCenturies later, sewers were constructed in [[southeast Faerûn]] in the cities of [[Medinat Muskawoon]]<ref> and [[Phoenix (city)|Phoenix]]<ref> as well as in [[northwest Faerûn]] by the elven kingdom of [[Earlann]], within such cities as [[Ascalhorn]] and [[Myth Glaurach]],<ref> followed by the [[Netherese Empire]].<ref>\n\nIn the millennia since Memnonnar was founded, sewers continued to be constructed for cities within the [[Lands of Intrigue]],\n\nDuring the time of the [[Shoon Imperium]], most of the cities in the Lands of Intrigue that were under its rule possessed sewers, including its capital [[Shoonach]]. When [[Strohm I]] led an assault on the city in the {{YearlinkName|449}}, he had many of his forces enter Shoonach through its sewers.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1372}},<ref> a period known as the [[Silence of Lolth]] caused such an upset in [[drow]] society that many fled to either the [[Upperdark]] or [[Lowerdark]]. Those who fled to the latter depths displaced the [[rylkar]], a rat-like species known to only a few Underdark experts. Forced into moving to higher subterranean depths, the rylkar began infesting sewers across the [[Interior Faerûn|Interior]] and [[West Faerûn|Western]] reaches of Faerûn, being reported in such places as Waterdeep and the kingdom of [[Cormyr]]. Posing a significant threat, adventurers across the land banded together to eradicate the infections. However, the rylkar proved to be quite adaptable, continuing to seemingly build colonies just as few as they were destroyed.",
