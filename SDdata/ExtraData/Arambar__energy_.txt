'''Arambar''' was a kind of ambient energy that enveloped the atmosphere of the world of [[Abeir]], changing the color of the sky from blue to steel-colored. Abeirans called this phenomenon the ''Steelsky''.

==Uses==
Since ancient times, the arambar was used by the [[Steelsky Liberators]], a group of rebels dedicated to free Abeir of draconic oppression, as a source to power certain spells and abilities of [[Divine magic|divine nature]] to combat [[dragon]]s and other monsters that oppressed the people of Abeir.

Likewise, a few Abeiran dragons inhaled arambar in a complicated [[ritual]] before their sleep in hopes of gaining insights into current or past events in a specific area of knowledge. This process was not reliable, however, and most of the time the dragons who performed the ritual learned nothing. In a few and rare instances, dragons failed to wake up again, and in time faded to a wraith-like form called [[rathrea]], gaining the ability to predict the future.

As of [[1479 DR]], the Empress Dragon [[Gauwervyndhal]] was known for forcing her suzerains to perform the ritual on her behalf.

Arambar had other uses as well, such as its ability to grant temporary precognitive powers.

==History==
The arambar began to exist on Abeir not long after the death of the [[primordial]] [[Arambar]], and many believed this energy came from its corpse, hence the name. The arambar was blessed by an unknown entity or god who opposed the rule of dragons, and this blessing was strengthened by the souls of those who died under draconic oppression ever since.

In [[1385 DR]], when the [[Spellplague]] sent the continent of [[Laerakond]] to the world of [[Toril]],{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|78}} the arambar suffusing the land was so strong that it changed the portion of the Torilian sky over Laerakond from blue to steel-colored. The ''Steelsky'' persisted even a century after, as in 1479 DR the sky above [[Laerakond]] was still the color of steel.
