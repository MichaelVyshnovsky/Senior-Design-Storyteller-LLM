        "Creation": "Wild psionic zones could come into existence in various ways. Small zones could appear when a [[psionic item]] or [[artifact]], or a place of great mental energy such as a temple or monastery to a god of psionics, was abandoned or lost for centuries. Left to decay and left alone, their power became warped, forming an area of unstable mental energy. Larger zones appeared at sites where potent psionics-users had died, suddenly and violently.",
        "Effects": "Only affecting psionic powers, wild psionic zones functioned similarly to wild magic zones. If a would-be manifester within the zone lacked sufficient skill, might, or good fortune, their power would go awry. This could range from working as intended, with or without cost in psionic energy; not working at all, again with or without cost in psionic energy; working at increased strength; affecting a random and potentially unwanted target or location; rebounding against the manifester; or producing an unexpected and potentially distracting effect such as [[glitterdust|shimmering colors]] about the manifester.",
        "Locations": "Although much rarer than wild magic zones, wild psionic zones appeared in places that had long been associated with psionic races such as [[mind flayer]]s and [[yuan-ti]]. However, they most often appeared close to the ruins of the cities of [[Jhaamdath]], the ancient fallen empire of the [[Vilhon Reach]] known for its psionic mastery.",
