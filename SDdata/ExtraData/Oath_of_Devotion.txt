[[File:Oath of Devotion.png|thumb|''A [[half-elven]] [[Oath of Devotion]] [[paladin]] from the [[Western Heartlands]].'']]
The '''Oath of Devotion''' was one of the sacred vows that [[paladin]]s could choose to take when they reached a milestone in their journey of faith. When they dedicated themselves to the tenets of this oath, they also were granted access to a set of [[spell]]s at no cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).

==Oath of Devotion Spells==
Novice paladins could cast ''[[protection from evil and good]]'', ''[[sanctuary]]'', ''[[lesser restoration]]'', ''[[zone of truth]]''. Adept paladins were able to cast ''[[beacon of hope]]'', ''[[dispel magic]]'', ''[[freedom of movement]]'', and ''[[guardian of faith]]''. Those that were very advanced had access to the ''[[commune]]'', ''[[flame strike]]'' spells.
