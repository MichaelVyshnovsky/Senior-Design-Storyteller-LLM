thumb|A half-elven Oath of Devotion paladin from the Western Heartlands.
The Oath of Devotion was one of the sacred vows that paladins could choose to take when they reached a milestone in their journey of faith. When they dedicated themselves to the tenets of this oath, they also were granted access to a set of spells at no cost (they could cast them at any time without having to prepare them in advance).
Novice paladins could cast protection from evil and good, sanctuary, lesser restoration, zone of truth. Adept paladins were able to cast beacon of hope, dispel magic, freedom of movement, and guardian of faith. Those that were very advanced had access to the commune, flame strike spells.
