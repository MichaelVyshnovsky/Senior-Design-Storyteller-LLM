'''Thorn Tree''' was a [[Heralds (local)|local office]] of the [[Heralds of Faer√ªn]], based in the city of [[Riatavin]] in [[Tethyr]] and performing Herald duties there.

==History==
In the late 1360s [[DR]], the office of Thorn Tree was occupied by a [[Thorn Tree (half-elf)|half-elf male]]. On the [[Feast of the Moon]] of the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], this Thorn Tree disappeared hours before he was to perform the [[Bloodsong]]. This triggered a storm of controversy. First, there were rumors that the [[High Heralds]] had plans to expel Thorn Tree for corruption. Second, the rebel government of Riatavin had hoped to use the Bloodsong to assert their authority over the city amidst their secession from [[Amn]] to Tethyr. Third, some claimed that Thorn Tree had been working for, variously, Amn, Tethyr, the [[Knights of the Shield]], or another faction of Riatavin. Thus, Thorn Tree's disappearance was expected to be powerful political ammunition for all these factions, further disrupting the secession. In fact, Thorn Tree had actually been murdered by one of the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]], and his body hidden so well it might never be found.
