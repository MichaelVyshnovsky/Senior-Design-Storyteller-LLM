His body is tattooed with Iokharic script and he hears voices speaking in Draconic. Mora speaks of her violent past and reformed nature to Solon. She gifts him her gold symbol of Torm.\nSeeking aid, they go to the gold dragon Oriel. Outside his lair, Dragon Cultists led by a lich attack and are held off by the heroes. Inside, Oriel removes the evil force inside Solon and absorbs it. But Oriel is consumed by it from within, transforming into an avatar of the dragon goddess Tiamat. She dragon breath attacks the group, but Solon displays cleric powers with the holy symbol of Torm and wards off her flame. The adventurers stay to confront Tiamat. There the story ends.\nthumb|right|250px|Solon meets Oriel."
