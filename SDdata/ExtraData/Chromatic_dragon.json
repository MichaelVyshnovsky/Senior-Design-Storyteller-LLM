        "mainbody": "Chromatic dragons were a type of dragon distinguished typically by a solid, non-reflective coloring of their scales, hence the name. They were generally evil, greedy, and predatory, and usually worshiped Tiamat, whom they regarded as their queen.\nIt was believed by scholars from Candlekeep that all species of chromatic dragons evolved from the proto-dragon species of the inficedraco genus.\nAlthough there were many chromatic dragon species, the following are the ones known by sages of Faer√ªn\nRed dragons Red dragons were greedy, chaotic evil creatures, interested only in their own well-being, vanity, and the extension of their treasure hoards. They were supremely confident, being the largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons. Typically found living in mountainous regions, they breathed a cone of fire.\nBlack dragons Black dragons, or skull dragons, were the most vile-tempered and cruel of all chromatic dragons. Excellent swimmers who normally lived in swamps and marshes, they preferred ambush attacks. They had a corrosive acid breath weapon.\nBlue dragons Blue dragons, or storm dragons, were manipulative, lawful evil chromatics who were infamous for their skill at creating hallucinations, and their cruel use of such things. They preferred aerial combat, which allowed them to use their electrical breath weapon most efficiently. Blue dragons most often lived in arid wastelands and deserts. They were the second most powerful of the chromatic dragons.\nGreen dragons Green dragons were highly territorial, deceptive, forest-dwelling creatures who loved secrets and intrigue. Although lawful evil, they were duplicitous and cunning foes who loved combat. They were the third most powerful of the chromatic dragons.  Their breath weapon was a cone of poisonous green gas.\nWhite dragons White dragons, also called ice dragons or glacial wyrms, were the smallest and weakest of the classic chromatic dragons. However, they were by no means harmless. White dragons were extremely well-suited to their arctic habitat and had excellent memories. They were more feral than other dragons, though, and always chaotic evil. They breathed a cone of ice or frost.\nBrown dragons Brown dragons, also called great desert dragons, were wingless, neutral evil dragons who laired in deserts. They preferred ambushes to straightforward combat, burying themselves in the sand.\nPurple dragons Purple dragons, also called deep dragons,\nGray dragons Gray dragons, also called fang dragons, were rapacious, violent dragons that were good at physical combat but poor at flying. Some gray dragons possessed an acid breath weapon.\nYellow dragons A very rare species of chromatic dragons, only a few individuals of this species had been spotted throughout history. Yellow dragons were solitary predators and secretive creatures, even among dragons. They were reported to dwell in deserts.\nSalt dragons Also called yellow dragons, and as rare as the other species called such. They inhabited salt flats and marshes, and were largely solitary creatures.\nPink dragonsAn exceptionally rare species which typically lived in underground lairs. They were known to be \"dopey looking\" and loved making jokes."
