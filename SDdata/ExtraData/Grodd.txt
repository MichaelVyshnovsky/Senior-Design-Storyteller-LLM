'''Grodd''' was a [[demiplane]] located in close proximity to the [[Plane of Shadow]].

The [[Grodd goblin]]s who inhabited this plane believed that the entire plane was underground and consisted of subterranean tunnels and caverns.

The [[Hoard (demiplane)|Hoard]] and Grodd demiplanes were linked via a ''[[gate]]''.
