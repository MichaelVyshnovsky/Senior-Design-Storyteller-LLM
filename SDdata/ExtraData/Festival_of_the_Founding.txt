The Festival of the Founding was a celebration held in Menzoberranzan on Ches 20 every year to commemorate the anniversary of Menzoberranzans founding by Menzoberra the Kinless. Unallied houses were to dine together as a display of unity. Sometimes Lolth appeared in the form of an avatar.
The first house, House Baenre, usually held only a cursory celebration.
