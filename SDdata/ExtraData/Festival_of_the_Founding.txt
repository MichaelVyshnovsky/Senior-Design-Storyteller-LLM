The '''Festival of the Founding''' was a celebration held in [[Menzoberranzan]] on [[Ches 20]] every year to commemorate the anniversary of Menzoberranzan's founding by [[Menzoberra the Kinless]]. Unallied houses were to dine together as a display of unity. Sometimes [[Lolth]] appeared in the form of an [[avatar]].

==History==
The first house, [[House Baenre]], usually held only a cursory celebration.
