Priests shield was a prayer cast by several clerics, most often battle clerics. When a cleric casted priests shield he or she struck a foe with their melee weapon while simultaneously enhancing their, and one nearby allys, ability to avoid injury for a brief moment. The strength of the prayer was consistent and proportional to that of the clerics physical power as well as the clerics degree of experience. Priests shield was easy to use and could be cast at will.
