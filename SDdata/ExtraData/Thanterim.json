        "Family Estate": "The Estate was located in [[Urmlaspyr]]. It contained a family crypt with the entrance to the family vaults located nearby. Near the crypt was also a shrine to [[Tymora]] which included a statue of the goddess.<ref>{{Cite book\n| author    = Pieter Sleijpen\n| title     = CORE1-1: Inheritance\n| series    = \n| year      = \n| publisher = \n| ISBN      = \n| pages     = 14\n}}\n\nThe passageways leading to the vault included a variety of traps and guardians. These protective measures included pit traps, magical crossbow turrets along with such homonculi as clay scouts and iron cobras. However the vaults also included statues of previous Thanterim lords and ladies, garbed in expensive clothing. Many of these were destroyed during the rebellions and by 1479 DR only a handful of the traps and guardians remained in working order.<ref>{{Cite book\n| author    = Pieter Sleijpen\n| title     = CORE1-1: Inheritance\n| series    = \n| year      = \n| publisher = \n| ISBN      = \n| pages     = 17\n}}\n\nOnce inside the vault itself there were no traps or guardians. Twenty feet by twenty feet, the vault contained a variety of items in 1479 DR including crates with packing straw containing porcelain tableware, porcelain vases and silver chandeliers. In addition there are paintings of rich merchants with the occasional adventurer while high quality tapestries mostly depicted hunting and naval scenes. Furthermore the vault included a beautifully decoated suit of magical armour that secretly bore the holy symbol of Tymora, skillfully hidden amidst the decorations of the armour. Finally the vault included a spellbook, beautifully decorated religious scriptures to Tymora, a detailed map of a Tymoran church with the text written in code to obscure the location of the church as well as the various deeds, shares and loans the Thanterim family owned in numerous companies.<ref>{{Cite book\n| author    = Pieter Sleijpen\n| title     = CORE1-1: Inheritance\n| series    = \n| year      = \n| publisher = \n| ISBN      = \n| pages     = 21\n}}\n\nIn 1479 the ruins of the Thanterim mansion are haunted by skeletons and undead spirits.<ref>{{Cite book\n| author    = Pieter Sleijpen\n| title     = CORE1-1: Inheritance\n| series    = \n| year      = \n| publisher = \n| ISBN      = \n| pages     = 22\n}}",
