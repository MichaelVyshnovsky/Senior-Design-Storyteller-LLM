==History==
At some point in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], an [[adventuring party]] somehow ended up in the [[Othrys]] layer of Carceri. There one of them, a [[paladin]] by the name of [[Uri]], would end up a captive of the Greater Titans{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|11}} after his fellow paladin [[Elendil]] cowardly fled from the scene. Uri spent the last days of his life in captivity,{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|18}} held in a tower on [[Mount Othrys]] and forced to engage in gladiatorial entertainment for the amusement of Hyperion.

In the month of [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]], in the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]] found themselves transported to the plane of Carceri after defending the [[githzerai]] fortress of [[Tah'Darr]] from a [[tanar'ri]] incursion. At the urgings of Elendil, the adventurers learned of Uri and sought out the Titan [[Cronus]] for a way back to [[Toril]]. They traveled together to Mount Othrys,{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|9-10}} with Elendil having last heard that Uri was recently involved in combat with tanar'ri.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|15}} They eventually made to  the crumbling palace of the Titans and inside Cronus informed Elendil that his colleague had been killed and eaten by visiting tanar'ri.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|18}}
