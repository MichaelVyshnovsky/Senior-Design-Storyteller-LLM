The '''Elemental sphere''' was a large group of spells encompassing divine magic that manipulated the [[Elemental planes|four elements]]&mdash;[[air]], [[Earth (element)|earth]], [[fire]], and [[water]]. Originally, [[druid]]s were granted major access and [[cleric]]s were granted minor access to these spells. Optionally, clerics got only minor access to the [[Elemental earth sphere|Elemental Earth]] and [[Elemental water sphere|Elemental Water]] spheres.
