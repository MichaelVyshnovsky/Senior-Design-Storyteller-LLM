The '''Days of Thunder''' was an ancient period of [[Toril]]'s history. This was the time of the fabled [[Creator Races|creator races]], or ''Iquar-Tel'Quessir'' in the [[elven]] tongue, and many other races still hid in caves. 

==History==
The Days of Thunder began when the majority of the glaciers left by the cooling of [[Abeir-Toril]]'s ocean during the [[Shadow Epoch]] finally revealed a supercontinent that would eventually be called [[Merrouroboros]]. Life bloomed on this landmass in the form of the [[creator races]] and the ancient [[ape]]-like ancestors of [[human]]s.

===Time of the Sarrukh===
Empires of the [[sarrukh]], a [[sauroid]] creator race, arose around {{Yearlink|-35000}}. The first was the realm of [[Okoth]], which came to dominate much of the land that would be [[Faerûn]] over the next century.

Around {{Yearlink|-34800}}, the sarrukh empire of [[Mhairshaulk]] was founded on the [[Chultan Peninsula]].

Around {{Yearlink|-34500}}, the sarrukh empire of [[Isstosseffifil]] was founded in the lands that would become [[Anauroch]].

Around {{Yearlink|-34100}}, Okoth fell after a century of civil unrest that caused many [[sarrukh]] to travel into the [[planes]].

Around {{Yearlink|-34000}}, the sarrukh founded the [[Ba'etith]].

Around {{Yearlink|-33500}}, the sarrukh empire of Mhairshaulk began its decline. The nation became the preserve of the [[yuan-ti]].

===Time of the Batrachi===
The [[batrachi]] were an amphibious race who evolved in the seas, their growth mirroring the sarrukh on land. When they became amphibious, they moved onto the land and supplanted the [[sarrukh|dinosauroids]]. The [[Batrachi Empires]] rose to power ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-33500}}.

The batrachi grew to the height of their power under the wise leadership of [[Zhoukoudien]], the High One. However, their golden age ended abruptly when the High One was killed in battle by [[Omo]], a [[titan]] thane of the [[Jotunbrud|Jotunbrud Tribes]], around {{Yearlink|-31500}}. 

Around {{Yearlink|-31000}}, the batrachi were losing a war against the titans and desperately enacted a great summoning ritual that unleashed several once-imprisoned [[primordial]]s. The [[god]]s swiftly opposed the primordials. The primordial [[Asgorath]], the World Shaper, even hurled an ice moon or comet at the planet, in order to destroy what she could not have, in an event called the [[Tearfall]]. Disastrous earthquakes, fires, and windstorms swept across all of [[Abeir-Toril]], erasing whole continents and rearranging the seas, causing the four [[Inner Sea]]s to merge into the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. Ancient sarrukh legends made cryptic mention of the "changing of the stars". But, before the world was destroyed, [[Ao]] split it into two twin worlds: [[Abeir]] for the primordials and [[Toril]] for the gods.

At around this time, the first [[dragon]]s eggs hatched all over Toril, number in the tens of thousands.

The extreme climate change swiftly led to the end of batrachi civilization. After a cold period called "the seven-turn winter", many batrachi left Toril for the [[plane]] of [[Limbo]]. Meanwhile, in the seas, the amphibioids appear to have faced pressure from [[merfolk]], [[sahuagin]], and [[triton]]s. Their society degenerated and collapsed back into barbarism.

===Time of the Aearee===
Meanwhile, there arose the [[Aearee Empires]]. The [[aearee]], an avian creator race, were the creators of the [[aarakocra]], [[kenku]], and other birdlike humanoids.

Around {{Yearlink|-30700}}, a number of [[lammasu]] defeated a much larger force of [[Aearee-Krocaa]], killing one thousand. The aearee later experimented on domesticated [[landwyrm]]s to create winged wyrms, or [[wyvern]]s. Supported by wyvern forces, the Aearee-Krocaa empire commenced a rapid expansion.

Around {{Yearlink|-30400}}, the [[gnoll]]s of [[Urgnarash]] battled the aearee of [[Kookrui-Shara]]. Gnoll shamans, following [[Yeenoghu]], summoned [[marrashi]] to spread disease among the aearee. Aearee crops were blighted, and the aearee suffered the [[Wasting Plague]]. The [[Aearee-Quor]] were decimated, and many of them began worshiping the [[demon lord]] [[Pazrael]] to seek salvation.
