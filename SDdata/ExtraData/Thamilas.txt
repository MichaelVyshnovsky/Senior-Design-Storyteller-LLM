Throughout the [[High Desert]] of [[Zakhara]], particularly north of the [[Range of the Marching Camels]], travelers could encounter depressions in the sand called '''thamilas'''.  These depressions often held yellowish water that was perfectly safe to drink despite its appearance.  Boiling the water was recommended as per drinking any water found in the wild. The water tasted like dirt from mineral deposits.
