Webs from the balloon carried a cocoon as big as a small house, in which was transported an [[arambarium]] mother lode. Alongside it, hundreds of spiders and giant spiders carried [[ettercap]]s and [[undead]] miners and deployed webs that were caught by the winds and pulled them into the air to follow the balloon. Their destination was a ''portal'' to the [[Demonweb Pits]].<ref>{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies||19}}",
