Swirling leaves of steel was an exploit that allowed a ranger wielding two melee weapons to attack all adjacent enemies in a spinning dance of blades.
Once per day, a ranger who learned this exploit could spin like a top with blades held out and  strike all adjacent enemies that he or she could see in the immediate surrounding circle.
