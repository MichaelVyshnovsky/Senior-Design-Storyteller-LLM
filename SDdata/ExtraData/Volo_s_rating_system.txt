'''Volo's ratings system''' was the means by which [[Volothamp Geddarm]] ranked taverns, inns, shops, alleyways, and so forth in his well-known guidebooks. The categories were as follows:<ref group="note">As Volo's ratings system has never been defined beyond a score out of 5, the following descriptions are presumed based on how it used in practice.

==Volo's System==
===Pipes===
[[Pipe]]s were used to rate the quality of inns, which were defined as any establishment that rented beds to travelers. The rating took into account such things as décor, comfort, service, food, ''et cetera''. The criteria did not include pricing.{{Speculation}}

An inn received a number of pipes from [[File:1pipe.jpg]] being the lowest quality to [[File:5pipes.jpg]] being the highest quality.

===Tankards===
[[Tankard]]s were used to rate the quality of taverns, defined as any public establishment that served alcoholic beverages. The rating took into account such things as atmosphere, watering of the drinks, service, décor, food (if any), ''et cetera''. The criteria did not include pricing.{{Speculation}}

A tavern received a number of tankards from [[File:1mug.jpg‎]] being the lowest quality to [[File:5mugs.jpg]] being the highest quality.

===Coins===
[[Coin]]s were used to rate the pricing of all businesses. The rating compared the general prices of goods or services. The rating did not relate to the quality of the goods or services offered.{{Speculation}}

A business received a number of coins from [[File:1coin.jpg]] being the least expensive to [[File:5coins.jpg]] being the most expensive.

===Daggers===
[[Dagger]]s were used to rate the dangerousness of alleyways, courtyards, lanes, ''et cetera''. The rating took into account such things as crime rates and the general propensities of the denizens of the area in question.

An area received a number of daggers from [[File:1dagger.jpg]] being the least dangerous to [[File:5daggers.jpg]] being the most dangerous.

==The Menzoberranzan System==
Guides to the city of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the late 1400s DR also had ratings for various establishments and they used a five-point system inspired by Volo's.

===Coin Stacks===
Stacks of coins were used to rate the pricing at all businesses, but not necessarily an indication of quality. A business received a number of coin stacks from [[File:1coinstack.jpg]] being the cheapest to [[File:5coinstacks.jpg]] being the most expensive.

===Stars===
The quality of an establishment was measured on a scale from [[File:1star.jpg]] as the worst to [[File:5stars.jpg]] as the best.

===Skulls===
Menzoberranzan was not a safe place in general, but certain locations were rated for their level of threat, from [[File:1skull.jpg]] for merely unsafe to [[File:5skulls.jpg]] for extremely deadly.
