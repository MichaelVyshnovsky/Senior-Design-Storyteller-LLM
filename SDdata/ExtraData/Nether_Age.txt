The '''Nether Age''' was a period of the history of [[Netheril]] lasting from {{YearlinkConvert|326|NY}} to {{YearlinkConvert|543|NY}}. It was a very important age for Netheril as the legendary [[Nether Scrolls]] were found during this time.

==History==
The Nether Age started with the discovery of the Nether Scrolls by [[Finder (Netheril)|Finder]]. These very powerful scrolls granted the Netherese greater understanding of [[magic]] and made their rise possible.

In {{YearlinkConvert|397|NY}}, [[Congenio Ioun]] created ''Congenio's pebbles'', which were later refered to as ''[[ioun stone]]s''.

The Netherese discovered the [[dwarves]] of [[Delzoun]] in {{YearlinkConvert|401|NY}} and established trade routes with them.
