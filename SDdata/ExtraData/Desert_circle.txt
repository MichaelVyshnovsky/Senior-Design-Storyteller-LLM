The desert circle was a druid circle associated with the sandy wilderness that held surprising varieties of life. This circle was a subset of the Circle of the Land.
Druids who took up the cause of nature in such a region had an affinity for this circle and the suite of spells that came to them without cost. These spells did not have to be prepared.
Novice druids could cast the blur and silence spells. Those that were more advanced were able to cast the create food and water, protection from energy, and blight spells, as well as hallucinatory terrain. Druids that were very skilled were able to use the insect plague and wall of stone spells.
