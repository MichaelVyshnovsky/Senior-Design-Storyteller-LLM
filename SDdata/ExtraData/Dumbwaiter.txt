A dumbwaiter, known in Common as a durthdra, was a type of lift designed for carrying food and small items
Dumbwaiters consisted of an open-fronted box
The term "durthdra" was a compound word, made up of the Alzhedo words "durth" and "uldra", meaning "platform" and "rope" or "pulley" respectively. Though made up of Alzhedo words, durthdra was not a proper word within the Alzhedo language and was little known by its speakers as such contraptions were rare in west Faer√ªn.
