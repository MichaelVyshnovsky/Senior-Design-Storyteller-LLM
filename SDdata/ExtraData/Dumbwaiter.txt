A '''dumbwaiter''', known in [[Common]] as a '''durthdra''', was a type of lift designed for carrying food and small items{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 18: The Finest Beds in Town}}

==Description==
Dumbwaiters consisted of an open-fronted box{{Cite dragon/415/Eye on the Realms: The Haunted Battlement|4}}

==Etymology==
The term "durthdra" was a compound word, made up of the [[Alzhedo]] words "durth" and "uldra", meaning "platform" and "rope" or "pulley" respectively. Though made up of Alzhedo words, durthdra was not a proper word within the Alzhedo language and was little known by its speakers as such contraptions were rare in [[west Faer√ªn]].<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2012)/Questions on The Haunted Battlement}}
