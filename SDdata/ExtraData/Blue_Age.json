        "mainbody": "he Blue Age was a time in the ancient history of Abeir-Toril when life on the planet resided in a single, vast ocean.\nThe Dawn War between the gods and the primordials raged mostly over this unfortunate planet at the time and one of the primordials, Dendar the Night Serpent, devoured the sun. The temperatures on Abeir-Toril subsequently dropped markedly and not long afterward, most life on the planet became extinct. Thus ended the Blue Age and the Shadow Epoch began."
