The '''Othrysian dodecahydra''' was a distinct, twelve-headed [[hydra]] that inhabited a series of caves on [[Mount Othrys]] on the plane of [[Carceri]], acting as a loyal guard animal of the [[Greater Titans]] that called the mountain home.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|14}}

==History==
In the month of [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]], in the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]] found themselves transported to the plane of Tarterus after defending the [[githzerai]] fortress of [[Tah'Darr]] from a [[tanar'ri]] incursion. At the urgings of the fallen [[paladin]] [[Elendil]], the adventurers sought out [[Cronus]] for a way back to [[Toril]].{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|9-10}} The adventurers rode a [[hot-air balloon|Carcerian skin balloon]] to Mount Othrys and eventually crashed when it was suffered too much damage from an attacking group of [[vrock]]s. Their balloon ended up crashing near the caves of the Othrysian dodecahydra,{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|12}} which emerged from behind a huge outcropping of rock in an agitated mood. The adventurers were forced to slay the hydra in order to continue their quest to meet Cronus.

When the Ravenians eventually returned back to their city on the [[Prime Material]], some of the [[knight]]ed members of the group received honors for having vanquished such a beast.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|22}}
