The Othrysian dodecahydra was a distinct, twelve-headed hydra that inhabited a series of caves on Mount Othrys on the plane of Carceri, acting as a loyal guard animal of the Greater Titans that called the mountain home.
In the month of Hammer, in the , a group of adventurers from Ravens Bluff found themselves transported to the plane of Tarterus after defending the githzerai fortress of TahDarr from a tanarri incursion. At the urgings of the fallen paladin Elendil, the adventurers sought out Cronus for a way back to Toril. The adventurers rode a Carcerian skin balloon to Mount Othrys and eventually crashed when it was suffered too much damage from an attacking group of vrocks. Their balloon ended up crashing near the caves of the Othrysian dodecahydra, which emerged from behind a huge outcropping of rock in an agitated mood. The adventurers were forced to slay the hydra in order to continue their quest to meet Cronus.
When the Ravenians eventually returned back to their city on the Prime Material, some of the knighted members of the group received honors for having vanquished such a beast.
