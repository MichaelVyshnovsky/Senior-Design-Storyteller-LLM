The exact meaning was not easily understood, but it combined features of many concepts of ethics into one overarching code of conduct. However, Ma'at was far more than a simple behavioral standard, but revered as the natural, divine, and fundamental state of all reality.\n\nAll things were expected to conform to Ma'at, for it put the gods, pharaohs, and commoners in their rightful place and allowed for peace between mortals and gods. To follow it was the one path to a happy life and to refuse could only be expected to result in misery and turmoil. Allegedly, without Ma'at, the very existence of the gods would be without foundation and the universe would crumble.\n\nFor lack of better terms, Ma'at could be treated as the natural desire of all persons to live a [[lawful good]] life. Following Ma'at meant fulfilling one's moral obligations to others, and applied to those of high station as much as those of low. Just as the common citizens were expected to put in an honest day's work and follow the law, so too was the ruler expected to provide compensation and administrate with fairness.",
        "Notable Adherents": "Most deities of the Pharaonic pantheon praised and upheld Ma'at as the underpinning order of their divine being and the Mulhorandi dynasty were heirs to its maintenance.\n\n[[Horus-Re]] was a strong believer in Ma'at. According to his doctrine, harmony came from living within it rather than fighting it. The laws existed to bring prosperity to its followers and the pharaoh and his representatives set laws as guidelines for honorable and traditional behavior. Should the guidelines not be applied with honor, however, [[Osiris]]'s fair judgement was left to determine the law.\n\nOutside the Mulhorandi pantheon, [[Anubis]] weighed the [[soul]]s of deceased mortals against the feather of Ma'at, revealing them to be just and honorable and worthy of reward should his [[balance|scale]] balance, or else be fed to a devourer of souls if it tipped the scale.\n\nMortal judges who followed Ma'at invoked its presence so as to decide cases with impartial justice. Similarly, rulers strove to govern according to the principles of Ma'at so justice and order would mark their rule, often seeking advice from [[cleric]]s to do so.",
        "Notable Detractors": "While all deities in the Pharaonic pantheon at the very least showed respect or keen interest in Ma'at,",
        "Disrupting Ma'at": "The Pharaonic pantheon was concerned more about the fight of law against chaos (though they did espouse free choice and individuality) than of [[good]] against [[evil]]. They counted their true foes not the simply malicious, but those who would destroy and send humanity back to their primitive origins. By Horus-Re's interpretation, that which led to evil was by its nature unlawful, and that which caused chaos unnatural. Treachery and traitors were similarly not to be abided, for such dishonorable behavior was against the divine order. Disrespecting the dead, such as by despoiling their resting places, was a violation of Ma'at particularly hated by Osiris.",
