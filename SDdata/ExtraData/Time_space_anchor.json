The area of protection was a sphere measuring  centered on the psionicist. Anyone within the sphere was protected as well so long as the psionicist wanted them to be. Inanimate objects were protected automatically. The time/space anchor would remain in place as long as the psionicist continued to expend psychic energy.\n* Vhondryl, a psionicist in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor\nCategoryPsychoportation powers\nj1qai3eedjawb1fsff19cl8f8pj3adr"
