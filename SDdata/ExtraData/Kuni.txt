The era of Kuni was a period of time in the mythological pre-history of the nation of Wa.
The era of Kuni occurred roughly two centuries before the start of the Wa calendar, (which was about six centuries before the beginning of the Dalereckoning.)These dates are estimated from the statement in Kara-Tur The Eastern Realms  that the shugenja Samon died "nearly 2,000 years ago". The Kara-Tur sourcebook is set in 1357 DR, and Blood of the Yakuza gives the year of Samons death as the 23 year of Kuni. It followed—not necessarily directly—the era of Koyo. It is not known to modern scholars if Kuni was the final of the pre-historical eras or if one or more followed after. The period was at least 23 years long.
There was only one dynasty of emperors of Wa during this time, the members of the line of Kasada.
* Samon, a famous wandering shugenja, whose ghost was said to haunt the mountain passes of the Hayatura Road in the Ikuyu Mountains.
* Emperor Nagazane, the emperor who reigned in the year of Samons death.
 23 year of Kuni  Samon is forced to seek shelter in the mountains during a blizzard, where he falls in love with a woman and breaks his vows of chastity to take her as his wife. In the morning after consummating his marriage, he finds that she has turned into a snake. The discovery drives him insane and he flees to his death in the mountains.
