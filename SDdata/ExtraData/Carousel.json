        "mainbody": "arousels, were a type of amusement ride found in the Realms.\nthumb|290px|An elabrote carousel in the Witchlight Carnival.\nAround 1375 DR, Mistress Norali had created an approximation of a carousel in the Undermountain community of Spiderhaven. But unlike the carousels of the Gondsmen, which were mechanical in nature, hers utilized relatively benign undead animals.\nIn the late 14 century DR, Father Otis Gregor of the temple Turning Wheel in Ravens Bluff, believed that his clergy needed to take a more visible role in their community. To that end he had his clergy construct and maintain childrens playgrounds in the parks of Ravens Bluff, which featured carousels.\n* The Jack Mooney & Sons Circus had a merry-go-round that was built by the gnome Tarontuttle and cost a copper piece to ride. It notably had a pipe organ in its center, whose valves were opened and closed by the rides various cams and levers as its outer ring rotated. Rather than being self-propelled, it was provided motive power by a team of six horses attached by spokes and harnesses. Its riding animals were wooden and painted, consisting of griffons, unicorns, pegasi, and dragons. Each of these animals had its own system of wheels, cranks, and cams to make it go up and down as the outer ring platforms rotated. The dragons in particular moved their wings in beat with the pipe organs music.\n* Beyond the Prime Material, the planes-faring Witchlight Carnival had a carousel. Its riding vehicles were magical wooden unicorns that could speak."
