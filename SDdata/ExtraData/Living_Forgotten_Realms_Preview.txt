{{Main|Scalegloom Hall (adventure)}}
{{Quote|''The vicious kobolds are at it again, raiding caravans, plundering outlying farms, and raising havoc across the land. All signs point to the influence of a charismatic leader, a malevolent fiend that has stepped up the kobolds' aggression and turned them into a menace. Your task is simple: enter the trap-filled tunnels of Scalegloom Hall, find their leader, and defeat him. 1{{st}}-level characters are provided. A D&DÂ® 4{{th}} Edition and Living Forgotten Realms preview adventure.''}}

===PREV-2 Escape from Sembia===
{{Main|Escape from Sembia}}
{{Quote|''You weren't looking for trouble in civilized lands, just some good adventuring leads. Before you knew what was really happening, you wound up in the middle of an information exchange, and now you have to escape from the lands of Sembia to preserve your very lives! Off the beaten path to shake any pursuers, you take to the wilds in the hope that you'll reach a safe haven before you're captured. ''Escape from Sembia'' is a Forgotten Realms adventure for five 1{{st}}-level characters and is a preview of the 4{{th}} Edition D&D game. The adventure has several decision points, but mostly consists of linear encounters that allow players to try out their characters' abilities and learn the game.''}}
