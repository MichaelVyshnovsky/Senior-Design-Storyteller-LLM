        "Effects": "The manifester accessed the latent psionic energy within a single item up to {{SI|60|yd|long=yes}} away, controlled and focused it, and finally released it with explosive force. It could target inanimate objects (including worn [[armor]] and carried [[weapon]]ry), [[:Category:Plants|plants]] and non-sentient [[plant creature]]s, [[golem]]s and animated matter, and mindless corporeal [[undead]] such as [[skeleton]]s and [[zombie]]s, but not [[animal]]s, free-willed undead, and all thinking creatures. [[Magical item]]s and animated materials such as golems could resist. According to the degree of success, the explosion damaged a portion of the object or creature, up to {{SI|8|cu ft|long=yes}}. This could weaken or destroy it outright, leaving chunks or only dust. Everything within {{SI|10|ft|long=yes}} was damaged or injured by the blast. ''Detonate'' could blow a hole in a wall, leaving an opening of {{SI|3|sq ft|long=yes}} in a {{SI|10|in|c|long=yes|adj=thick}} wall.",
