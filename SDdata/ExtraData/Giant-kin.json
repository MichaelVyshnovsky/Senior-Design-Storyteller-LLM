        "mainbody": "iant-kin were large humanoids related to the true giants. Any race that could trace its lineage back to Otheas relationship with Ulutiu could be considered giant-kin. The mother of all giants, Othea, cheated on her husband Annam All-Father, the father of giants, with Ulutiu, producing the firbolgs, fomorians, verbeegs, and the voadkyn. All true giants considered these types of giant-kin maug because of this act of unfaithfulness.\nDespite the usual reluctance of giant-kin to interact with other giant-kin species, the coming of the Twilight Spirit increased the activity of true giant tribes in the Ice Spires, leading to concerns among giant-kin for their own protection, and some resulting cooperation between the species.\nA typical giant-kin pregnancy was nine months, and the offspring took around eighteen years to reach maturity.\nGiant-kin did not generally associate with different types of giant-kin. Within their own tribes, they were bound by the ordning (except firbolgs), and when they did interact with other giant species, they were ranked below all others, except ogres. Most giant-kin were under the impression that one day, they would be accepted back into \"true giant\" society and be accepted by their half-brothers.\n* Firbolgs \n* Verbeegs \n* Voadkyn\n* Fomorians\nThe ogres were created during Otheas affair with Vaprak, and as a result were despised as giant-kin by true giants. Cyclopes and cyclopskin were of unknown descent but were believed to be the product of another of Otheas affairs."
