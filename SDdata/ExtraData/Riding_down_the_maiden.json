Some time later, mounted searchers would head out and search for \"the Maiden\". The search continued until sundown and at the end of the day, the parties involved would celebrate with a grand revel. If the lady was found, she would escort whomever found her. If she managed to elude all the searchers, she would choose her company for the revel from among the riders who participated in the game.\nSome believed this game was derived from an old Malarite ceremonial rite, where convicted criminals were temporarily liberated and allowed to flee for their lives. The faithful of Malar would treat them as quarry and hunted them down. If they survived until nightfall they would earn their freedom for good. Other Ravenians believed it originated from a particular noblewoman, who promised her hand in marriage to anyone who could match her skill as a woodcrafter.\nCategorySports\nmzqcghajs5qfkr3tltsxun9sks45hy5"
