Built on ''[[Chainmail]]'' fantasy rules, it consists in a box set with three booklets, ''[[Men & Magic]]'', ''[[Monsters & Treasure]]'', ''[[The Underworld & Wilderness Adventures]]'', and five supplements, ''Greyhawk'', ''Blackmoor'', ''Eldritch Wizardry'', ''Gods, Demi-Gods, & Heroes'' and ''Swords & Spells''.\n\nIn 1977 was introduced the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set]]'', followed by ''Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set'' and several supplementary books. The basic set dealt with characters from levels 1-3; as characters got stronger, players had to move to the more advanced rulebooks to manage their characters.\n\nIn 1978 was published '''Advanced Dungeons & Dragons''' ('''AD&D'''), with its three \"core rulebooks\", ''[[Player's Handbook]]'', ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' and ''[[Monster Manual]]'', but this was a new ruleset that was unrelated to the original rules. A second edition of AD&D was released in 1989, which is still popular today.\n\n[[File:Players Handbook 3rd.jpg|thumb|The ''Dungeons & Dragons'' 3rd Edition ''[[Player's Handbook]]'']]\nAfter [[Wizards of the Coast]] bought the rights to ''Dungeons & Dragons'', a more streamlined version of the game was released in 2000, called ''Dungeons & Dragons'' 3rd Edition. Most die-rolls were done with a 20 sided [[dice|die]], instead of different types of multi-sided dice. The 3rd edition rules were eventually revised in 2003, and version 3.5 was released.\n\n''Dungeons & Dragons'' 4th edition was published in June 2008 with completely revamped gameplay mechanics, combat rules, and magic system. This shakeup of tradition received mixed reviews.\n\nOn January 9, 2012, [[Wizards of the Coast]] announced that they had begun work on ''Dungeons & Dragons'' 5th edition<ref>[http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x": "dnd/4ll/20120109 Charting the Course for D&D: Your Voice, Your Game].
