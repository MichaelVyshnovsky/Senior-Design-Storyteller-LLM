Since the Forgotten Realms is the core campaign setting for fifth edition, most Adventurers League adventures are set within that world. It was created in 2014 as a replacement for the the Role Playing Game Association.\nThe Adventurers League is a continuation of the D&D Encounters program that was part of the fourth edition experience. Stores that are members of the Wizards Play Network can submit reports on the results of adventures, just like they could during the Encounters program, but are no longer beholden to a weekly schedule.\nThe Adventurers League reintroduces factions into the game not seen since the Legacy of the Green Regent RPGA campaign. Players are encouraged to join one of five factions based on their class and alignment which will lead to special sidequests and rewards. The five factions are\n* The Emerald Enclave\n* The Harpers\n* The Lords Alliance\n* The Order of the Gauntlet\n* The Zhentarim\nIn 2014, Wizards of the Coast rebranded their Dungeons & Dragons organized play program, renaming it the D&D Adventurers League. This rebranding coincided with the launch of 5 edition. Initially, the in-store organized play program was divided into D&D Encounters and D&D Expeditions, but this division was retired in 2016. The D&D Adventurers League has since reorganized its play program into various new campaign formats and settings.\nAs of June 2024, there are four Premier Organizers for the Adventurers League Baldman Games and Gamehole Con in the United States, the Greasy Snitches in the Philippines, and Tabletop Scotland in the UK. These licensees are granted sections of the Forgotten Realms to release their own official adventures for the Adventurers League.\nIn March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Wizards of the Coast suspended in-store events in North America, Europe, and Latin America. In October 2020, they announced the ticketed D&D Virtual Play Weekends series organized by Baldman Games. This monthly event adopts a convention-style format and includes the option of either Adventurers League legal games or non-AL games.\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of D&D in 2024, Wizards of the Coast announced a series of events, including an official weekly actual play titled Legacy of Worlds, produced by the D&D Adventurers League and Six Sides of Gaming. Premiering in February 2024, the series features Devin Wilson as the Dungeon Master, with Luke Gygax, Ed Greenwood, Keith Baker, Elise Von Brandthofen, and Tommy Gofton playing various official D&D characters. In March 2024, Gary Con will feature a live show for Legacy of Worlds the show will then resume its weekly format until October 2024, concluding with its finale at Gamehole Con.\nDesigned to tie in with the published campaigns, most Adventurers League modules are part of overarching plotlines that link to a published campaign that was being focused on at the time of release. Nomenclature for the module titles indicated to which \"season\" they belonged and their place within that storyline.\nOutside of the numbered seasons are a wide range of modules collectively known as Season 0 or Season Agnostic adventures. The majority of these are non-canonical, including modules written specifically for conventions, modules set outside of the Forgotten Realms, or other content intended to be confined to organized play. In addition, there are non-canonical Author Only (AO) Adventures large convention exclusives which can only be run by the person who wrote it, but which the author may make available for wider play by retiring it and turning it into a Season 0 module. Exceptions to the non-canon rule for Season 0 modules include the Dreams of the Red Wizards storyline, which was turned into its own standalone \"season\", and modules designed to tie-in to the releases of hardcover sourcebooks In Volos Wake for Volos Guide to Monsters, Underworld Speculation for Xanathars Guide to Everything, and Rrakkma for Mordenkainens Tome of Foes.\nThe Tyranny of Dragons storyline modules were primarily set in the city of Phlan, though there was also a module set on the Sword Coast. It is thematically linked to Hoard of the Dragon Queen and The Rise of Tiamat.\nThe Elemental Evil storyline modules were based in Mulmaster. It is thematically linked to Princes of the Apocalypse.\nThe Rage of Demons storyline modules were primarily set in the Moonsea region and on the Sword Coast. It is thematically linked to Out of the Abyss.\nAlso titled \"Misty Fortunes and Absent Hearts\", The Curse of Strahd storyline modules were primarily set in the Demiplane of Dread realm of Barovia, which are beyond the scope of this wiki, but also included some modules involving the re-taking of Phlan in the Moonsea region and several Faer√ªnian characters who had been transplanted to Barovia. It is thematically linked to Curse of Strahd.\nThe Storm Kings Thunder season visits various settlements and nations, including Parnast and the environs of the Greypeak Mountains, Hartsvale, the Nelanther Isles and several sites surrounding Beregost, including Ulcaster and Durlags Tower. It is thematically linked to Storm Kings Thunder.\nThe Tales From the Yawning Portal season provides introductory adventures for all of the modules included in the hardcover, framing them to take place in the Forgotten Realms if they were originally designed to take place on worlds other than Toril. There are also Epics for each module so higher-level characters can enjoy adventuring at these sites without being too powerful. It is thematically linked to Tales from the Yawning Portal.\nThe Tomb of Annihilation season is set in Chult, with the added difficulty that until Acererak is defeated, any characters who die while playing cannot be raised from the dead, and if they had been before the season started, they would lose health every in-game day until they died or Acererak was defeated. It is thematically linked to Tomb of Annihilation.\nThis season of adventures is set primarily in and under the city of Waterdeep. It is thematically linked to Waterdeep Dragon Heist and Waterdeep Dungeon of the Mad Mage.\nThe Avernus Rising season is primarily set in Baldurs Gate The series originally was titled \"Inglorious Redemption\" this was changed to \"Avernus Rising\" shortly after the release of early series documents. It is thematically linked to Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus.\nThe Plague of Ancients storyline modules are primarily set in the Icewind Dale region. It is thematically linked to Icewind Dale Rime of the Frostmaiden.\nAnother set of adventures that can take place outside the continuity of any other season, but released in a way similar to the majority of the other seasons rather than in the way of Season 0. This season does away with low-level adventures, instead concentrating on modules that are designed exclusively for adventurers of level 5 and higher. They are also written in a way that allows them to link into the Ghosts of Saltmarsh hardcover adventure."
