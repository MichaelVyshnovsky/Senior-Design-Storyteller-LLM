Most constructs were non-intelligent automatons with neither a soul nor a purpose beyond service to their creator.\nBecause few constructs were truly alive, usually operated only by a \"spark\" of life, most were immune to attacks that targeted the living. These \"dead\" constructs possessed low-light vision and darkvision and were immune to mind-altering, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease-related, and death effects. Nor did these constructs require sleep or have any metabolic activities, such as eating or breathing. The major exception to this rule were living constructs, which included warforged.\nCategoryConstructs\nSome particular types of constructs were\n* Astral construct Psion created and temporarily manifested constructs.\n* Chardalyn dragon Evil draconic constructs made from Chardalyn.\n* Clockworks Several types of magical mechanical devices created by gnomes.\n* Crawling claw Masses of amputated left humanoid hands.\n* Golem Several types of magically created combatants with incredible defenses.\n* Helmed horror Animated suits of plate mail armor.\n* Homunculus Small constructs are created to aid spellcasters.\n* Inevitable Beings of law from the planes. They enforce the fundamental laws of nature and morality and punish those who violated them.\n* Modron Immortal construct race that embodied universal order, just like slaads to chaos, fiends to evil and celestials to good.\n* Nimblewright Thin, dexterous and intelligent constructs often employed for stealth missions.\n* Shield guardian Large constructs that served to protect wizards.\n* Tomb tapper These were long ago creations of Netheril."
