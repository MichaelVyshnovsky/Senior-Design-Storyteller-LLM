Most constructs were non-intelligent automatons with neither a soul nor a purpose beyond service to their creator.\n\nBecause few constructs were truly alive, usually operated only by a \"spark\" of life, most were immune to attacks that targeted the living. These \"dead\" constructs possessed [[low-light vision]] and [[darkvision]] and were immune to mind-altering, [[poison]], sleep, [[paralysis]], stunning, [[disease]]-related, and death effects. Nor did these constructs require sleep or have any metabolic activities, such as eating or breathing. The major exception to this rule were [[living construct]]s, which included [[warforged]].",
        "Examples of Constructs": ":''[[:Category:Constructs]]''\nSome particular types of constructs were:\n* [[Astral construct]]: [[Psionics|Psion]] created and temporarily manifested constructs.\n* [[Chardalyn dragon]]: Evil draconic constructs made from [[Chardalyn]].\n* Clockworks: Several types of magical mechanical devices created by gnomes.\n* [[Crawling claw]]: Masses of amputated left humanoid hands.\n* [[Golem]]: Several types of magically created combatants with incredible defenses.\n* [[Helmed horror]]: Animated suits of [[plate mail]] armor.\n* [[Homunculus]]: Small constructs are created to aid spellcasters.\n* [[Inevitable]]: Beings of [[law]] from the [[plane]]s. They enforce the fundamental laws of nature and morality and punish those who violated them.\n* [[Modron]]: [[Immortal]] construct race that embodied universal [[Lawful neutral|order]], just like [[Slaad|slaads]] to chaos, fiends to [[evil]] and celestials to [[good]].\n* [[Nimblewright]]: Thin, dexterous and intelligent constructs often employed for stealth missions.\n* [[Shield guardian]]: Large constructs that served to protect [[wizard]]s.\n* [[Tomb tapper]]: These were long ago creations of [[Netheril]]."
