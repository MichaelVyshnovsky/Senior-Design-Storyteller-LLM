These fields were the product of mortal use of the Shadow Weave. By the 14 century, there were so many users of Shars magic interface that traces and leaks occurred, which eventually created the rare Shadow Weave nodes.\nThe shape of an energy field had no limitation to it, for example it ignored every kind of physical barrier. This lack of limitation had one exception, the size. A Shadow Weave node of a particular strength could only have a size within a particular limit.\nA Shadow Weave node was a powerful tool for a Shadow Weave user, provided the user knew about the very existence of such a node and its location.\nA Shadow Weave node could be used to enhance magic and to gain spells. However, unlike other nodes, Shadow Weave nodes could only be accessed by Shadow Weave users. Spells that used light as well as evocation and transmutation spells could not be enhanced. However, enhancing an enchantment, illusion, and necromancy spells was easy compared to other nodes. The spells of a Shadow Weave node were different from node to node, but followed a pattern. Every Shadow Weave node could grant enchantment, illusion, and necromancy spells, and spells that used darkness of any school, but never one that used light.\nA special use of a Shadow Weave node was the one to physically empower people. The stronger the node was, the stronger the persons physical abilities could become. A user of the Shadow Weave could harness energy from the Shadow Weave magic to empower any one aspect of his or her physical nature.\n*Earth node\n*Evil node\nCategoryMagic\nriycprykatqsas89rsfscsnbv18bklc"
