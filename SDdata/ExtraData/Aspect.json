        "mainbody": "An aspect was an alternative form of a powerful extra-planar being such as deity, primordial, or even a demon lord. The concept of divine aspects was referred to as the Plurality of Being.\nA deity or primordial may have had multiple aspects, and some of these aspects were different from each other. Deities could have multiple aspects in one or more pantheons, as worshiped by multiple different races.\nFor those deities worshiped across multiple planets, each local aspect was different from its other iterations.\nMortals of monotheistic faith may have focused worship on only a specific aspect, or multiple aspects, of their chosen deity. \nSome people were unfamiliar with the concept of divine aspects may not have acknowledged divine beings from other pantheons, unaware that deities were a member of the pantheon they worshiped.\nFollowers of the Adama believed that the myriad gods of the known pantheons were all aspects of the One.\n* Aerdrie Faenya was considered to be an aspect of Akadi.\n* Bes of the Mulhorandi pantheon was considered to be as aspect of the dwarven god Vergadain.\n* Entropy, an aspect of the dragon goddess Tiamat.\n* Ghaunadaur, the Elder Elemental God, was worshiped as an aspect of Juiblex solely within Realmspace.\n* Lathander was considered an aspect of Amaunator by some. Yet others believed Amaunator was merely masquerading as Lathander for some centuries.\n* Sehanine Moonbow was considered an aspect of Selune, specifically to the fey races.\n* Hanali Celanil was considered an aspects of Sune, the Goddess of Love, Beauty, and Passion. \n* Shekinester was a deity known as the Five-Faced Queen. She originally had three aspects the Weaver, the Empowerer, and the Preserver, but later gained two more aspects the Acquirer and the Seeker. Each of these aspects were completely different in their alignments, appearances, and aims.\n* Talos was an aspect of Gruumsh, the patron of the orc pantheon.\n* Tymora and Beshaba were considered by some to be two aspects of Tyche, the Netherese goddess of luck and fortune.\n* Zinzerena, an aspect of Lolth."
