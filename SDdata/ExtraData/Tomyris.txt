'''Tomyris''', the '''Meeting Ground''', was one of the most important places for the [[Issacortae]] tribe. This was a high bald hill
circled by monoliths and surrounded by many tribal dwellings.

Usually, the high king or queen lived far from Tomyris with their people, but the great shaman lived there all year and looked after the site. Each year, the leaders of all the Issacortae tribes gathered here to listen to the predictions of the shaman and to discuss important matters. Tomyris was also a place for negotiations during extremely important situations, whether natural disasters, an enemy invasion, or the death of a king, queen, or shaman. The tribal chieftains chose their new king or queen, while the shaman chose their own successor with the chieftains officiating.<ref>
