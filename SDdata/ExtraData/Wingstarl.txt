The '''Wingstarl''' family was a [[human]] family of merchants in [[Zhentil Keep]] who plied their trades around the [[Moonsea]] area. The family made its fortunes by building fine temples in the [[Dalelands]] and the Moonsea in the 13th century DR. The wizard [[Sememmon]] was originally Malathar Wingstarl, a member of this family.{{Cite dragon/357/Volo's Guide: Renegades of Darkhold|72}}
