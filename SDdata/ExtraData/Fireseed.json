        "mainbody": "Fireseed was an alcoholic beverage made by dwarves.\nIt was a non-magical liquor that had negligible effects on dwarves and gnomes. Fireseed was more potent to other races, however, either increasing natural resistances or debilitating drunkenness.\nDwarves and expert brewers could easily identify fireseed by its smell. It was stored in brown glass bottles that contained six shots."
