When used in battle, it looked like a radiant blue-white flame. For a long time, the ability to control spellfire was believed to be unique to a single person each generation, but that was a fallacy most wielders simply chose to hide their ability in order to avoid getting noticed by powerful organizations such as the Cult of the Dragon.\nThe bearers of lesser and true spellfire include\n* Shandril Shessair\n* Dammasae the Incantatrix, mother of Shandril\n* Baerendra Riverhand\n* Haelam Sunderstone\n* Iliph Thraun\n* Myrjala Talithyn\n* Shoulree Talaeth\n* Elminster Aumar\n* Khelben Arunsun\n*Laeral SilverhandChristopher Perkins, James Haeck, James Introcaso, Adam Lee, Matthew Sernett (September 2018). Waterdeep Dragon Heist. Edited by Jeremy Crawford. (Wizards of the Coast), p. 207. ISBN 978-0-7869-6625-7.\nAs of 1372 DR, other wielders of true spellfire were reported to be a mage in hiding in the Border Kingdoms, a noble of Chessenta known for their cruelty and arrogance, and a wizard whose name begins with \"R\".\nWhile both spellfire and silver fire originated from the raw energy of the Weave, they didnt have exactly the same effect. Spellfire was pure raw energy, while silver fire was a power granted to the Chosen of Mystra to channel the Weaves energy in a more subtle way.This silver fire may be the same as lesser spellfire, as most of Mystras Chosen are stated to have only lesser spellfire on page 56 of Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition.\nSpellfire was introduced and showcased in the story of Shandril Shessair as told in the novel Spellfire written by Ed Greenwood.\nFRMagefeu\nCategoryMagic\nCategoryRaw magic\nrmir222n9q2612ugas1ggmdpo34bkyz"
