'''Rosestone Abbey''' is a partially ruined abbey located in Eastern [[Thar]] dedicated to the worship of [[Amaunator]].

==Description==
Much of the abbey is ruined with many gaps in the outer curtain wall.  Some of the inner buildings remain intact and these are occupied by a small number of priests.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, Rosestone Abbey was the site of a battle between forces loyal to the rightful Harmach of [[Hulburg]] under the command of [[Kara Hulmaster]]  and those of the shadow [[mage]] [[Rhovann]] and his puppet [[Maroth Marstel]].  The loyalist army won the battle after [[Geran Hulmaster]] destroyed a magical device that animated dozens of [[golem]] soldiers in Rhovann's army.<br />
