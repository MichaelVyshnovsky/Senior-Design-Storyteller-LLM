Rosestone Abbey is a partially ruined abbey located in Eastern Thar dedicated to the worship of Amaunator.
Much of the abbey is ruined with many gaps in the outer curtain wall.  Some of the inner buildings remain intact and these are occupied by a small number of priests.
In the , Rosestone Abbey was the site of a battle between forces loyal to the rightful Harmach of Hulburg under the command of Kara Hulmaster  and those of the shadow mage Rhovann and his puppet Maroth Marstel.  The loyalist army won the battle after Geran Hulmaster destroyed a magical device that animated dozens of golem soldiers in Rhovanns army.
