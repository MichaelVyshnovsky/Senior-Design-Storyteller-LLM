A thieves guild was a guild of organized thieves and rogues. Most major cities in Faerûn, and some smaller ones, had one or more thieves guilds. Some were powerful enough to hold significant political power, which they often obtained through bribery and intimidation. Most local guilds were short-lived groups that revolved around a particular individual.
Members of thieves guild often served one of the following roles, which were divided into divisions in larger guilds assassins, beggars, bounty hunters, burglars, con artists and tricksters, cutpurses and pickpockets, enforcers and thugs, racketeers, scouts and spies, and fences, smugglers, and pirates.
