thumb|Prey of giant spiders, cocooned in giant spider silk.Spidersilk or spider silk was a fiber produced by various species of spiders, as well as some spider-like creatures such as aranea, driders, and chitines.

In the , drow used a hot-air balloon made from spider silk in the shape of a massive arachnid as they evacuated from Ithimir Isle off the coast of Akan√ªl. Webs from the balloon carried a cocoon as big as a small house, in which was transported an arambarium mother lode. Alongside it, hundreds of spiders and giant spiders carried ettercaps and undead miners and deployed webs that were caught by the winds and pulled them into the air to follow the balloon. Their destination was a portal to the Demonweb Pits.
