[[File:Giant spider silk bg3.png|thumb|''Prey of giant spiders, cocooned in giant spider silk.'']]'''Spidersilk''' or '''spider silk''' was a fiber produced by various species of [[spider]]s, as well as some spider-like creatures such as [[aranea]], [[drider]]s, and [[chitine]]s. The term also referred to the processed form of the fiber, which was used for various textile purposes in the Realms.

==Description==
In its refined state, spidersilk lost the inherit stickiness found on spider threads. Armor and clothing fashioned from it tended to be rather quiet and lightweight.

==Availability==
* Some in the land of [[Chult]] manufactured spider silk from the local spiders and would refine their threads further with the aid of [[potash]].<ref>
* In the [[Hordelands]] great amounts of spidersilk was found in [[Khopet-Dag]], owing to the many [[giant spider]]s that lived in the mountain range.
* In the [[Duthcloim]] district of [[Menzoberranzan]], [[Sh'aun Darnruel]] sold exquisite gowns of the finest spidersilk to the [[matron mother]]s.<ref>

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1367}},{{AQ-time}} the [[House of Al-Kamari]] of [[Huzuz]] was experimenting with spider silk, even though the yield was low and the overhead was high. [[Mu'izzi al-Kamar]] gifted a vest and sash of spider silk cloth to [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]], while his sibling [[Dakim ibn Mu'izzi]] was working on a bedspread for him.

In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, [[drow]] used a [[hot-air balloon]] made from spider silk in the shape of a massive arachnid as they evacuated from [[Ithimir Isle]] off the coast of [[Akan√ªl]]. Webs from the balloon carried a cocoon as big as a small house, in which was transported an [[arambarium]] mother lode. Alongside it, hundreds of spiders and giant spiders carried [[ettercap]]s and [[undead]] miners and deployed webs that were caught by the winds and pulled them into the air to follow the balloon. Their destination was a ''portal'' to the [[Demonweb Pits]].<ref>{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies||19}}
