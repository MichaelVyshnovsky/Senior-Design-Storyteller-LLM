Low-light vision was a type of vision that many creatures had. It allowed them to see further in areas that only had a small amount of light.
Creatures with low-light vision had eyes that were far more sensitive to light than normal. As such, they were able to see twice as far in dim light than creatures with ordinary vision could. Unlike those using darkvision in darkness, those with low-light vision could distinguish between colors, instead of seeing shades of grey. In areas with an exceptionally low amount of light, those with low-light vision could still make out words or symbols.
Creatures known to have low-light vision were moon elves, lythari, and leucrottas.
Knights of the Order of the Blue Moon gained a form of low-light vision known as "lunar sight".
