Little is known of this powerful arcane ritual but it is believed to be capable of freeing Calim and Memnon from their prison.  The ritual requires two books, one of which is held by the efreet of the city of Memnon.  The other book was in the possession of Corvus Nightfeather.  However, when Shahrokh imprisoned Corvus and destroyed his magical items, the extraplanar space the book was stored in was destroyed.  Many of the items stored in Corvus pocket plane materialized in the archmage Acham el Jhotos laboratory and the book may be among these items.
