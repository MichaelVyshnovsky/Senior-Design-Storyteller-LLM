Mimes were a variety of entertainer in the Realms.
In Faer√ªn, mimes could commonly be found in Waterdeep, and the city of Zhentil Keep. In Waterdeep, the majority of licensed mimes were members of the Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers.
Mimes could be found as far back as the Empire of Netheril, where on the Karsus Enclave they were part of the League of Noted Singers and Performers.
* Swen Sigirdson, a traveling entertainer in the Vast, sometimes worked as a mime after having picked up a costume secondhand.
* The Laughing Mime was an alias of the mysterious leader of the rock gnome kingdom Songfarla.
