However, they were harassed by looting mobs of refugees from Tantras, Calaunt and even Mulmaster, whod also come through Maerstar. Stonegiant buried a hoard of coins and trade-bars in one of Maerstars horse paddocks to protect them from the looters, but did not survive to retrieve them afterwards. The hoard was reputed to still be buried in Maerstar by 1370 DR.\n* It should be noted that Shondarl was not necessarily a stone giant, and more likely that Shondarl or their family was named after one. By the context of Maerstars description, Shondarl Stonegiant likely came from either Procampur or Tsurlagol.\nCategoryMerchants\nCategoryInhabitants of the Vast\nCategoryInhabitants of North Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Faerûn\nCategoryInhabitants of Toril\nCategoryInhabitants\nnyteuf0clv05i312bodiriemkqnyqbc"
