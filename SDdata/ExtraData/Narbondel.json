At the end of every day, the Archmage of Menzoberranzan cast magic upon the stone to heat it. The heat from the Archmages spell formed a band around it and moved up. When the end of the glow was at the pillars top, the day was almost done.\nBesides being the clock of Menzoberranzan, the stone pillar housed a much greater secret. Within the stalagmite, the ancestors built the tomb of the legendary founder of the city itself, Menzoberra the Kinless. From the top of the pillar, a secret stair lead to the hidden chamber where the body of the priestess once lay in a cocoon upon a huge spiders web spanning a tremendous abyss. When Zaknafein took the Dagger of Menzoberra, the spiders web crashed and the cocoon with the corpse fell into the depths.\nArchmageMaestro\n* \n*War of the Spider Queen\n* \ndeNarbondel\nCategoryTombs\nCategoryLocations in Menzoberranzan\nCategoryLocations in the Upperdark\nCategoryLocations in the Northdark\nCategoryLocations in the Underdark\nCategoryLocations in Faer√ªn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\n7pr6he28qxym3matciov72ifv1zjipx"
