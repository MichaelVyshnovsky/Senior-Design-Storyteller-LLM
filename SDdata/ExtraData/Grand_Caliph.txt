'''Grand Caliph''' was the [[Midani]] title for the ruler of all of [[Enlightenment|enlightened]] [[Zakhara]].<ref>

The Grand Caliph led the Land of Fate in matters of state as well as faith from his seat, the [[Palace of the Enlightened Throne]] in the capital city of [[Huzuz]]. The extent of his influence on the more distant parts of his realm, however, often remained in doubt.

==History==
The Grand Caliph in [[1367 DR]]{{AQ-time}} was [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir]], the 18{{th}} bearer of the title and direct descendant of the first Grand Caliph, an [[al-Badia]] boy who found the teachings of the [[Loregiver]] and united all lands of Zakhara under the banner of [[Enlightenment]] more than 500 years earlier.
