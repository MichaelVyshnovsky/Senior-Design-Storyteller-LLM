It typically involved the devil granting a significant boon or gift to an individual, and the contractee owing a specific debt to the [[fiend]].",
        "Description": "Contracts varied in form and appearance, but were often presented with grand theatricality, such as appearing within a cloud of smoke or delivered by an [[imp]]. Some of the more common forms contracts could take included: written in blood on a [[scroll]] of [[vellum]], inscribed upon stone formed by rapidly cooling lava,{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 5|19}}\n\nWhile infernal contracts were always written in the [[Infernal language|Infernal script]], they could be endorsed by several means. A devil might only require the bound party to sign upon a parchment while others might dictate an act of depravity be performed.{{Cite adventurers league/Faces of Fortune|8}}",

            "Ending Contracts": "Infernal contracts could be voided so long as both parties agreed. Under these circumstances, the devil and the contractee each continued on with their existences as if the contract never existed to begin with. Devils often requested significant compensation before agreeing to nullify an infernal contract. Compensation for nullification often included endowment of great personal wealth, one or more ''[[soul coin]]s'', or extremely powerful [[artifact]]s.\n\nContracts that were not fully ratified could be broken by other supernatural means, though the exact specifications of this were unclear. A ''[[devil talisman]]'' crafted from the blood of an [[empyrean]] and powered by the soul of a mortal was one known method.{{Cite comic/Infernal Tides 4|14}}"
