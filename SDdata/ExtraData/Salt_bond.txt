A salt bond was a formal sign of hospitality offered by a host to a guest and was prevalent in Zakharan culture.
As the name suggested, salt bonds became a formal bond when the guest consumed salt from the hosts table. Salt bonds typically lasted for three days, during which the host assumed full responsibility for the guests welfare. Guests under protection from a salt bond also agreed that no harm should befall the host as well, either by themselves or any member of their family. In fact, many Zakharans honored salt bonds long after the three day period ended, extending courtesies when the two parties met elsewhere in the future.
