A '''salt bond''' was a formal sign of hospitality offered by a host to a guest and was prevalent in [[Zakhara]]n culture.

As the name suggested, salt bonds became a formal bond when the guest consumed [[salt]] from the host's table. Salt bonds typically lasted for three days, during which the host assumed full responsibility for the guest's welfare. Guests under protection from a salt bond also agreed that no harm should befall the host as well, either by themselves or any member of their family.<ref> In fact, many Zakharans honored salt bonds long after the three day period ended, extending courtesies when the two parties met elsewhere in the future.
