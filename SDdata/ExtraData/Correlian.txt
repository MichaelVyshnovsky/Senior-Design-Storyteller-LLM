Correlian was a constellation in the elven tradition. It consisted of thirteen stars. By its name, this constellation may be associated with the elven deity Corellon.
It could be observed in autumn.
In moon elf tradition, the appearance of Correlian marked the official end of summer.
The liquor known as Elverquisst was distinctive for displaying a replica of Correlian as part of its drinking ritual.
