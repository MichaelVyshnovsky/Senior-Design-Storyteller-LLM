        "History": "This brutal sport involved direct competition between two participants. A victor was declared only when one of the combatants was knocked unconscious. Matches were observed by [[priest]]s that ''[[heal]]ed'' all physical harm sustained during a bout. The only illegal moves were biting, eye-gouging, and breaking fingers. Pankration tournaments involved bouts of winners facing winners until only one participant was left standing.",
