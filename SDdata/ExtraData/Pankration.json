A victor was declared only when one of the combatants was knocked unconscious. Matches were observed by priests that healed all physical harm sustained during a bout. The only illegal moves were biting, eye-gouging, and breaking fingers. Pankration tournaments involved bouts of winners facing winners until only one participant was left standing.\nCategorySports\nCategoryMartial arts\n4r1vzzcg9rbqyugk4ra3qquzmktv1ek"
