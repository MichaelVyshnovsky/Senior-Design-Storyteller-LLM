The collection known as '''Soargar's Legacy''' was a selection of relics of [[Old Impiltur]], including the [[Crown of Narfell]] and a hundred or so [[magic]]al [[sword]]s. Before the kingdom's fall, these wondrous items were safeguarded by the [[Mage Royal]], [[Soargar]], in hope that they would be used to once again unite the realm.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|922}}, a disease known as the [[Tortoiscab Plague]] was inflicted upon the [[Elethlim Dynasty|royal family]] of Impiltur, and within [[924 DR|two years]] the only survivor was Princess [[Aliia]]. The young heiress to the kingdom had been betrothed to, and since sailed off to marry, Prince [[Rhiigard Obarskyr]] of [[Cormyr]]. However, she perished as well in the {{YearlinkName|926}}, when her ship, ''[[Nadyra's Glory]]'', was sunk by the [[succubus]] [[Soneillon]], the same [[fiend]] responsible for her family's untimely deaths.

As the court of Old Impiltur devolved into throngs of feuding nobles and families vying for power, Soargar raided the royal treasury and made safe the kingdom's most treasured material possessions. Soargar kept these relics hidden and safe until a time when he saw best to reveal their whereabouts.

This time came over a century later, in the {{YearlinkName|1095}}, after [[War captain (Impiltur)|War Captain]] [[Imphras Heltharn]] united the city-states of [[Lyrabar]], [[Hlammach]], [[Dilpur]], and [[Sarshel]], along with their [[elven]] and [[dwarven]] neighbors, and led them in a campaign to defeat a massive horde of [[hobgoblin]]s from the [[Earthfast Mountains]]. Aiding this alliance were Soargar, the [[sorceress]] [[Sambrall]], and a visiting mage from [[Baldur's Gate]] by the name of [[Velgarbrin]]. A decisive battle in the conflict took place on the shore of the [[Bluefang Water]], which saw Imphras, Soargar, and their allies victorious, though at a cost. The old wizard took a mortal wound and, in his last breaths, urged the War Captain to seek out his tower in [[Lyrabar]] the symbol of royal Impilturan rule, and over 100 [[sword]]s of legend that had been borne in service to the throne.

After their uncovering by Imphras, these weapons were bestowed upon his most loyal companions in battle, many of whom would go on to serve in his [[Royal guard (Impiltur)|royal guard]]. Some of these blades remained in service to Impiltur, while others since went missing or were otherwise unaccounted for.
