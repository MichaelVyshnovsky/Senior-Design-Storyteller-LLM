They were discovered by the Coronal and their house was destroyed, most of the members being imprisoned magically inside Arcorars keep,\nTheir numbers, amongst others, constitute the daemonfey. The Dlardrageth tower near Myth Drannor has long since been abandoned.\nOver hundreds of years, the house was responsible for the corruption and poisoning of the houses of Reithel, Yesve and others of Siluvanede and the last mention of the house was in relation to the Seven Citadels War, which the house provoked, but they were found out soon after, being imprisoned beneath Ascalhorn.\nIn 1369 DR the Harpers destroyed Hellkeep Gate and surviving daemonfey of House Dlardrageth were freed after millennia of imprisonment Brian R.
