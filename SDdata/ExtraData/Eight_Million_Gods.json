        "Rituals": "There were no consistent or common rites for the Eight Million Gods, and observances were different for each deity and for each shrine. However, they did have some similarities and generally involved ritual purification and making prayers and offerings of food or money, such as at planting time. The benefits that the deities and their rites granted were all different too.\n\nOnce a year, if not more often, the major shrines held grand festivals including bonfires, sacred dances, and processions along streets. Such festivals aimed to entertain their respective deities and could grow rather rowdy.",
        "History": {
            "Legends of Kozakura": "",
            "Legends of Wa": "The island of [[Tsukishima]] was established by the Spirit of Wa. It was here, at the foot of [[Mount Matazan]] that two sisters, the beautiful Bloom Lady and the unappealing Rock Lady competed for the hand of Ninigi, the August Grandchild. After Ninigi selected the Bloom Lady as his bride, the Rock Lady cursed her sister's flowers to live but brief lives.\n\nThe Spirit of Wa once banished the \"[[devil]]s\" who used to roam the main island to the [[Isle of Devils]], where each was trapped unless a human voluntarily agreed to take its place.\n\nOnce, several centuries before {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}, a [[human]] [[wu jen]] of Wa who had incredible power and incredible ambition even tried to challenge the Eight Million Gods for control of [[Toril]]. For anyone else, the gods might just have ignored him, but for a wu jen of his power, they dared not. Thus, an alliance among the gods cursed him and transformed into a tigbanua buso. This didn't exactly eliminate his threat, however: as a tigbanua buso, he attacked innocents and could turn them into tagamaling busos.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Ninja Wars]]'' only refers to \"the gods\" and \"a consortium of gods\". While it is unknown which gods or even which pantheon, by their association with Wa, this article assumes they are among the Eight Million Gods."
        },
        "Afterlife": "In Wa, the spirits of all the newly deceased were required to follow the [[River of Three Routes]], or Sanzu-no-Kawa, to reach the [[afterlife]]. Where the river was found was not for the living to know, but one theory placed it in the [[Ikuyu Mountains]], likely near [[Mount Matazan]], another a tributary of [[Lake Sari]], yet it could just as easily be found within a seashell or under a rock. Obviously little reliable knowledge made it back to living ears.\n\nThe Three Routes led to different afterlifes: the Beast Life, the Great Hells, and the Realm of the Hungry Ghosts. On their journey along either, spirits encountered ghostly judges who examined them and gave them trials to perform. After completion, the King Judge evaluated the spirit fully and passed sentence on them, including punishments. Only after fulfilment of the sentence could a spirit achieve peace in an afterlife.\n\nOthers followed the River for different reasons. The legless ghosts known as [[chu-u]], who were not evil enough to warrant further sentencing yet not good enough to pass the judges were doomed to crawl along the Three Routes seeking other spirits who could testify for them to the King Judge. There were also devils that menaced defenseless spirits, but these were fought by the wanderer Jizo.\n\nAlong the River was a barren and dusty river bed called the River Basin of Offering, or Saino-kawara. The spirits of infants who'd died from parental neglect wandered its banks eternally. Jizo patrolled the basin often to protect them.",
        "Locations": {
            "Lands": "It was the very oldest belief of [[Kozakuran]]s, and was one of the two major religions of Kozakura, the other being the [[Way of Enlightenment]]. The [[Kanchai]] school of the Way of Enlightenment in Kozakura borrowed freely of the concepts, beliefs, and entities of the Eight Million Gods, and observed them and their rituals.\n\nIn Wa, a number of sects followed the Eight Million Gods in an open manner. Although it was not explicitly encouraged by the government, they approved it as a non-corrupting religion.",
            "Shrines": "Shrines to the Eight Million Gods were generally constructed at sites of particular natural beauty or significance in a local legend, such as on the banks of rivers, beside the ocean, on the sides of great mountains, or deep in forests, or where a god once washed his hands or a spirit dwelled. The majority of shrines were completely independent from the others, and had features and beliefs unique to them. There were two kinds: normal shrines and first shrines.\n\nThe normal shrines were usually erected and supported by the local peasantry, and even by local nobility when in villages and towns close to their own homes. The purposes of these shrines could be to guarantee good harvests, commemorate historical events, to ward against evil, or even to appease powerful entities.  \n\nThe first shrines were larger and more influential, and had received centuries of recognition and support from nobility and emperors. More often than not, these shrines were found in older parts of district and provincial capitals. A good number opened branches in other provinces to spread their particular beliefs and gain greater economic support.\n\nThere also very important shrines in Kozakuran dedicated to key deities like the sun goddess and the emperor."
