The oracle went to a certain location and said that a child marked with [[magic]] would save the Talfirc. The child would go on a quest to defeat a darkness like no other. However, someone had to help the child when he came, and thus the Talfirc built the city of [[Talis (city)|Talis]] on the spot and waited for the child to come.\n\nBut the child never came and the Talfirc disappeared, Talis was ruined, and the prophecy forgotten by all but the the witch [[Isela]], who dwelled there in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nThen, in the {{YearlinkName|1364}}, the reformed [[Fellowship of the Dreaming Dragon]], accompanied by [[Cormik]] and [[Jewel Talondim]] arrived in Talis after they escaped the hands of the [[shadevar]]. [[Kellen Caldorien]] was the child wizard of the prophecy, and his father, [[Caledan Caldorien]], was becoming the next [[Shadowking]], the darkness that the child must defeat.",
