Of the various [[archfiend]]s, '''demon lords''' were without a doubt the most numerous, with no fixed number or known limit to their numbers. They were powerful, unique demons that ruled over their lesser kin and controlled portions of or even entire layers of the Abyss.<ref>

This list details many of the lesser-known [[demon lord]]s, and excludes the more infamous [[Demon lord#Demon Princes|demon princes]] (including the former demon prince [[Miska]]) and [[Obyrith#Obyrith Lords|obyrith lords]] written of elsewhere.

====Ahazu====
Ahazu, called the Seizer, was a demon lord associated with night and abduction. After he came to rule his layer, he discovered that by digging great holes into the ground he could reach thin spots in the membrane around that layer, beyond which was a void called the Shattered Night. After a long time of digging, he reached a tear big enough for him to step through, which he did, and was never seen again after that. He was known to make pacts with other demon lords, offering power in exchange for them being taken to Shattered Night upon a certain condition.<ref>{{Cite dungeon/148/Wells of Darkness|62-64}}

====Alvarez====
Alvarez, called the Purging Duke, was a demon lord associated with inquisitions and torture. He ruled [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 57: Torturous Truth|Torturous Truth]], the 57{{th}} layer of the Abyss. He considered himself the inquisitor of the tanar'ri, and endlessly hunted for any taint of lawfulness amongst demonkind. He was famous in the Abyss for the inventive tortures he came up with, administered by him and an exceptionally loyal team of demons (though their loyalty was born out of fear of being next, for he was no less brutal with his own troops). It was said that he was originally a mortal who was so clever and hateful that he charmed the [[nalfeshnee]] who was judging him, and that he spent only three millenia as an ordinary demon (and then, only as a [[chasme]] and then a [[glabrezu]]) before becoming a demon lord. Physically, he appeared as a human male with oily, blue-black hair and neat clothing. Mentally, he was insane and dedicated to chaos, so much so that he was known to favor [[slaad]] and use them as agents at times. At other times, he was known to use mortal agents. Those who did a bad job for the Purging Duke, however, did not live long enough to worry overmuch about their failure.<ref>

====Alzrius====
{{Main|Alzrius}}

Ansitif,{{Cite dragon/360/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Graz'zt, the Dark Prince}} was one of the first tanar'ri demon lords to rise after the fall of the obyriths, and he quickly seized control of [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 21: The Sixth Pyre|the Sixth Pyre]], the 21{{st}} layer of the Abyss. Whereas most demon lords sought divinity for themselves, Ansitif loathed the very existence of deities and, unable to challenge them directly, took out his fury by corrupting and destroying religious sites and sacred relics. It was said that at the height of his power, his layer was littered with broken relics and ruined temples of countless faiths. He was also said to have enjoyed the company of succubi, that he was one of Malcanthet's first lovers, and that the first [[lilitu]] were born as a result of their meetings. However, he was one of the seven demon lords who allied to bring down [[the Malgoth]], but who fell in the process as they were killed or imprisoned by opportunistic rivals; in his case, he was imprisoned in the [[The Wells of Darkness]] and became a vestige.{{Cite dragon/357/Gazing into the Abyss|67}}

====Ardat====
Ardat, called the Unavowed and the Queen of Harpies, was a demon lord associated with secret or failing marriages and [[Harpy|harpies]].

Most of her worshipers were harpies, as well as a few sirens and demented humanoids. Her favorite cultists and minions were the Soul Sirens, a cabal of half-fiend harpies; after Baphoment betrayed her and several of the Soul Sirens, she became obsessed with vengeance against him. Sacrifices to Ardat were lashed to thorn trees, flayed, and left to die of exposure; harpies typically sang to keep the victim enthralled during the ritual. In the Abyss, Ardat was a nomadic demon lord, with her favorite haunts being the Grand Abyss, the Plains of Gallenshu, the shores of the Scalding Sea, and Torremor (after Baphomet betrayed her, an act which led many to think she was trying to ally with Pazuzu against the Prince of Beasts).<ref>{{Cite dragon/359/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Apocrypha|47}}

He was once one of Demogorgon's most potent rivals, until the Prince of Demons tricked him into crossing a particularly territorial pantheon of deities who destroyed him and his realm, N'gharl, which was then the 230{{th}} layer of the Abyss. However, after the deities cast the compacted N'gharl onto the Astral plane, Demogorgon retrieved it and placed it on the Material plane, where it warped the jungle around it until a crazed tyrannosaurus ate it- and became Azuvidexus reborn, but as a servant of Demogorgon.<ref>{{Cite dragon/357/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Demogorgon: Prince of Demons|29-30}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/re/20030414a|title=The Crawling Jungle|accessdate=2022-06-28|author=[[James Jacobs]]|date=2003-04-14|work=Random Encounters|publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101074222/http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/re/20030414a|archivedate=2016-11-01}}

Baltazo, called the Seeping Sovereign, was a demon lord associated with diplomacy and strategy. He ruled a fortress on [[Pazunia]]. He appeared as a corpulent human male with an elongated face and deep green skin that constantly fizzled and popped, leaking sickly fluids upon his ill-fitting military uniform, which was adorned with dozens of ostentatious ribbons and medals. He had originally been a successful general in the Blood War before he retired and, knowing he had no chance of ruling the then-rulerless [[Hollow's Heart]], he instead took over the fortress of Shullen-Gat that stood upon the edge of the pit in Pazunia that led to Hollow's Heart, from where he could influence events in that wartorn layer. When [[Fraz-Urb'luu]] returned and destroyed the petty demon lords who dared to try and rule Hollow's Heart, he permitted Baltazo to retain his command of Shullen-Gat as a vassal, and sometimes a diplomat or interlocutor as well.<ref>

====Codricuhn====
Codricuhn, also known as the Blood Storm and once called the Prince of the Eight Seas, was a primordial-turned-demon lord who sought the destruction of all creation. His form was indiscernable underdeath the numerous chain wrapped around him to slow his ascent, save for a single, baleful red eye, leaking dark demon ichor. His transformation was only physical, however, and it was the evil of the Abyss that compelled him to destroy; in his mind, he mourned for the past he had lost. He climbed slowly up the Abyss, and many creatures- gods, mortals, devils, and other demon lords- had all placed chains upon him to slow him, for it was thought that when he reached the top he would destroy creation. A storm, called Coagulus, surrounded him, acting as his realm, as well as six spheres of solid matter wherein lived those demons that served him. He was also served by a cult, called the Imminent Catastrophe, a type of demon called [[terraghul]]s, and a unique demonic being, originally an archon that had been corrupted, that was known as the [[Voice of the Storm]].<ref>{{Cite dungeon/172/The Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Codricuhn}}

However, Ebulon was defeated during a battle against Demogorgon, who dumped his barely-living body into a pool in the Wells of Darkness with the intention of using Ebulon as a tool against Graz'zt, a plan he soon forgot after stationing a [[maelephant]] as the pool's sole guard. Graz'zt, on his part, sought to rescue Ebulon out of a sense best described as loyalty, although Ebulon himself resented the long imprisonment and knew many secrets of Graz'zt's past that could be used against the demon prince.

====Eldanoth====
Eldanoth, called the Bloodless Scion, was a demon lord associated with crime. He ruled [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 359: The Arc of Eternity|The Arc of Eternity]]. He was a former slave of [[Orcus]] who escaped when the goddess [[Kiaransalee]] destroyed that demon prince, after which he fled to the Arc of Eternity. Eldanoth aspired to become a god of crime and hatred, and he had many adherents of the layer of Thanatos amongst the demonic cultists there, to whom he had become something of a folk hero to during Orcus's exile. Of course, Orcus erased all of Eldanoth's following upon his return (although some sacred texts and dark hymnals remained).

Lascer, the Lord of the Shadow Shoal, was originally a human, the planar explorer who discovered Zionyn. However, on his second visit to the place, he came to the attention of [[Obox-ob]], who captured and experimented on the new creature.

Obox-ob then repurposed Lascer as an assassin.{{Cite dragon/359/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Apocrypha|49-50}}

Lascer dwelled in a half-living, half-fossilized mobile fortress constructed of deep-sea creatures called Seahold that roamed the Abyssian Ocean. Depending on the rumor, he either fought against or was allied with [[Dagon]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/349/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Dagon: Prince of Darkened Depths|35}}

Lascer was the leader of a small but powerful cult of assassins. Sacrifices to him were first tortured, then forced to walk on broken glass, then had wires pierce their hands, and then finally vivisected and their entrails fed to sea spiders, crabs, and lampreys. [[Kelvezu]] demons were also known to serve Lascer.

Once, she had been the consort of [[Pazuzu]], but she betrayed him; in retaliation, he ate out her eyes and imprisoned her in Torremor, which had orginally been his domain, impaling her on a gleaming spire in Onstrakker's Nest. Even after she assumed control of Torremor, he did not consider her a threat, instead watching with amusement as she grasped for power and influence from an Abyssal backwater.

|The Queen of Desolation’s actions signify her unspoken message: The Abyss shall have no lord but ruin.
|The [[Demonomicon of Iggwilv]]<ref>
}}
Oublivae, called the Queen of Desolation, the Demon Monarch of the Barrens, and the Angel of the Everlasting Void, was a demon lord associated with ruin and history. She ruled [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 100: The Barrens|The Barrens]]. Her knowledge of history was rivalled only by that of Graz'zt, Vecna, and Iggwilv, but her area of expertise centered around destruction and ruin. She only allied with select demon lords in order the halt the expansion of rivals' realms, further spreading chaos throughout the Abyss.

Oublivae's head was that of a luminous fey crowned with horns. Her body resembled a humanoid insect, complete with sharpened armor plating and a sinuous tail that terminated in a deadly stinger. Oublivae's long ghoulish tongue was used to lap up the blood of her victims. When provoked, Oublivae dropped to all fours and attacked like a feral beast. She preferred to isolate her foes and pick them off one at a time, showing them glimpses of a future where all they loved was destroyed, before consuming their souls.

Undead and other demons not sworn to Orcus followed Oublivae, spreading her chaos and hopelessness wherever they roamed. Mortal followers of Oublivae were often pirates, outlaws, and savages. Most decorated their bodies with tattoos mimicking Oublivae's own appearance. They consumed the flesh of their enemies to honor the Queen of Desolation.

Oublivae crawled up from the dregs of the Barrens during an unknown age, eventually garnering the attention of the Barrens' lord at the time, [[Ugoreth]]. Ugoreth surrounded her with his minions and demanded her service. Oublivae managed to convince the demon lord that she carried a message for his ears alone, using Ugoreth's vanity to gain a private audience with him. Oublivae attacked the demon lord, consuming his soul and sending him to the bottomless ruins of the Barrens and claiming the title of Demon Lord for herself.

Rajzak, called the Lord of the Spires, was a maddened and bestial demon lord who dwelled in the [[Layers of the Abyss#The Spires of Rajzak|The Spires of Rajzak]], killing and devouring any creatures it encountered. He was some {{SI|80|ft}} tall and at least twice as wide as that, an obscene mass of claws and mouths, with some parts seeming reptilian, others amphibian, and yet others thoroughly indescribable, all covered in oozing sores and propelling itself along on dozens of stubby limbs. It healed at an alarming rate, being capable of even regrowing limbs lost to battle or accident. Rajzak was said to exist only to eat and destroy; it gave no sign of being capable of either speech or intelligent thought. However, it was said (in an obscure and cryptic passage in the [[Demonomicon of Iggwilv]]) that Rajzak was originally one of the earliest demon lords, known in those long-ago ages by a name long since forgotten, and was then a demon lord of both beauty and guile. He was said to have meddled in the politics of the Abyss and the planes, which eventually led to him coming into conflict with Graz'zt- a conflict that ended with a battle in which Graz'zt tore Rajzak's mind and soul away, hiding it as "an itinerant hellflame, forever lost." Scholars who studied this passage largely agreed that Graz'zt intended to keep his former enemy trapped and tormented in its former domain, although some scholars thought that Rajzak had tricked Graz'zt into transforming it, and that it was slowly becoming the most powerful demon prince in the cosmos.

He was once a lesser deity of the yuan-ti before he performed a ritual meant to merge his mind with his layer in an attempt to gain power. However, while the ritual succeeded, it drove most of his mind insane and turned the layer into lifeless, chaotic whirling storm. The remaining sane portion of his psyche formed a physical form, a {{SIAdj|60|ft|adj=long}} winged ebon serpent. While this physical form could be killed, it always reformed back in the Mind of Evil, for at the price of his sanity and godhood, Sch'theraqpasstt had achieved indestructible immortality.

====Tharzax====

[[File:Turaglas.png|thumb|200px|right|''Turaglas, the Hunger Eternal.'']]
Turaglas ({{Pronounce|tu|RAWG|lahss}}, sometimes spelled Turgalas), called the Ebon Maw, the Hunger Eternal, the Insatiable and the Devourer, was a demon lord associated with hunger and consumption. He ruled over [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 32: Sholo-Tovoth: The Fields of Consumption|Sholo-Tovoth]]. He was the largest and among the most primal of the tanar'ri demon lords, motivated by nothing more than endless hunger, uncaring of the affairs of mortals or other demons. In the distant past when he first crawled out of the depths of the Abyss, he took part in the wars amongst the demon lords, but in time he somehow reached the Material plane, where he began to devour everything, from the smallest creatures to the largest, and even plain stone. He was worshiped by a powerful cult called the Feeders of the Ebon Maw that wrecked devastation in his name, and served by a type of tanar'ri called the [[turagathshnee]]. But in time, his cult was scattered and he was imprisoned, by two most unlikely allies: Orcus and Demogorgon. The two demon lords set their own cults to destroying the Feeders, their armies against the Devourer himself, until at the last the two demon princes themselves stepped through a gate to fight and imprison the Ebon Maw, greatly weakened, in a place between worlds. And then their cults wiped all mention of Turaglas from the world, so that he might never break free and rise again.<ref>{{Cite dragon/312/The Ebon Maw}}

====Verin====
Verin,<ref>

In his travels through the Abyss, Verin catalogued the obsessions and weaknesses of the demon lords and set his master's enemies at each other's throats. For these purposes, he assumed various disguises, most notably a black-skinned mirror of his true form that went by the name Ztefano, who was a welcome guest wherever Verin was not trusted. Ztefano was just as brilliant a diplomat as Verin, but he specialized in fueling schisms and wars rather than alliances.

====Volisupula====
Volisupula, called The Flensed Marquesse, was a demon lord associated with finery and ostentatious ceremony. He ruled the eighth layer of the Abyss, called [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 8: The Skin-shedder|The Skin-shedder]]. On occasion, he was known to have visited [[Sigil]].<ref>

====Vucarik====
Vucarik, the Consort of Chains, was a demon lord associated with chains and torture. He ruled over [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 651: Nethuria|Nethuria]]. He was humanoid in shape but covered by rust-darkened chains that wrapped around him. However, he was known to roam the Abyss at the head of a battalion, always preceded by loud metallic rattlings, inflicting the tintinnabulous word of the Consort of Chains on any who would listen. Occasionally, it was rumored, Vucarik hired those he ran across on his wanderings as heralds, rather than just killing them. A baatezu text called Deceptions and Stratagems linked Vucarik with the [[kyton]]s, but other sources said he was one of the sons of [[Pale Night]].

Yibyiru, called The Rancid Lady of Bitter Bile, was a demon lord associated with poison. She lived in [[Shedaklah]]. She was a demented, simpering creature with poisonous skin who acted as both chambermaid and majordomo to [[Zuggtmoy]]. When Zuggtmoy was away, in fact, Yibyiru was the one charged with keeping that layer safe, and her rage and poisons, which were potent enough to harm even other demons, proved more than up to the task, even to the point of keeping [[Juiblex]] in check. The foul-mouthed and fouler-smelling demon lord was also said variously to be either Zuggtmoy's daughter or senile mother.<ref>{{Cite dragon/337/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Zuggtmoy: Queen of Fungi|48}}

====Zuregurex====
Zuregurex, called the Lord of the Drowned, was a demon lord associated with storms and the drowned dead. He once desired the waters of the [[Gaping Maw]], [[Demogorgon]]'s layer, and invaded it while the Prince of Demons was invading [[Hollow's Heart]]. He lead an army of undead and demonically-fused air elementals in an attack on Lemoriax, and was just dismantling the gates the palace Ungorth Reddik when a furious Demogorgon returned. So enraged was Demogorgon at being both torn away from a near-sure victory against [[Fraz-Urb'luu]] and at having his home defaced that he not only slaughtered Zuregurex's army, but also pursued the lesser demon lord all the way back his own layer of [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 480: Guttlevetch|Guttlevetch]]. He invaded the layer, a place of hurricanes and shipwrecks and blood-soaked beaches, and turned the waters against Zuregurex and sunk islands. The Lord of the Drowned was forced to flee to a different layer, [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 245: The Scalding Sea|The Scalding Sea]]. Guttlevetch remained in ruins and Zuregurex in hiding, although there were whispers that he had returned to Guttlevetch in secret to begin rebuilding.<ref>{{Cite dragon/357/Demonomicon of Iggwilv: Demogorgon: Prince of Demons|24-25}}

====Zzyczesiya====
Zzyczesiya,<ref> called The Ungrasped, was a demon lord associated with confused and malevolent ignorance. He dwelled in [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 3: The Forgotten Land|The Forgotten Land]]. He was also one of the few entities to have escaped from the Wells of Darkness. It was incredibly obscure thanks to its choice of home layer, and it was said to revel in its anonymity. The more suspicious of those who sought the secrets of the Forgotten Land believed that Zzyczesiya knew a secret of great importance and had taken refuge there to avoid inquirers, and to eventually free itself of the terrible responsibility of the knowledge by forgetting it.<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/Fiendish Codex I, Part 2: The Lost Annals/Additional Layers}}
