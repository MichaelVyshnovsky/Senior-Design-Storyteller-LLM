Such spells can [[False life|grant]] an extra reserve of life force, [[Energy drain|drain]] the life energy from another creature, create the [[undead]], or even [[Resurrection (spell)|bring]] the dead back to life. The necromancy school had no subschools, but had moral divisions: ''[[Good|white]]'', ''[[Evil|black]]'', and ''[[Neutral|grey]]''. A [[wizard]] who specialized in the necromantic school was called a [[necromancer]].",
        "Abilities": "Spells involving the [[undead]] made up a large portion of this school, including ''[[animate dead]]'' and ''[[finger of death]]''.",
        "Practitioners": "Some practitioners were referred to as \"white necromancers\", individuals that used their powers to heal the living, ensure the dead were properly and permanently interred, and otherwise served to the betterment of society. They were typically found within the clergies of [[church of Jergal|Jergal]], [[church of Kelemvor|Kelemvor]], and [[Church of Chauntea|Chauntea]]. Most \"white necromancer\" were publicly unknown due to the deep stereotype spread by \"black necromancers\" in history, therefore, these \"white necromancers\" have a \"cover identity\" and a job as a herbalist, gardener, or gravekeeper.{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-05-15 - White necromancers}}",
