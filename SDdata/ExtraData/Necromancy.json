Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life. The necromancy school had no subschools, but had moral divisions white, black, and grey. A wizard who specialized in the necromantic school was called a necromancer.\nSpells involving the undead made up a large portion of this school, including animate dead and finger of death.\nSome practitioners were referred to as \"white necromancers\", individuals that used their powers to heal the living, ensure the dead were properly and permanently interred, and otherwise served to the betterment of society. They were typically found within the clergies of Jergal, Kelemvor, and Chauntea. Most \"white necromancer\" were publicly unknown due to the deep stereotype spread by \"black necromancers\" in history, therefore, these \"white necromancers\" have a \"cover identity\" and a job as a herbalist, gardener, or gravekeeper.\n* Aumvor the Undying\n* Kazerabet\n* Sammaster the Mad\n* Shoon VII\n* Sumulael\n* Szass Tam\n* Sofina\n* Velsharoon\n* Xzar\n* Ysuran Auondril\n* Zallanora Argentresses\ndeNekromantie\nCategorySchools of magic\nCategoryMagic\nobpuvyim2bv4i5q9l0z0fb9fbywoi9d"
