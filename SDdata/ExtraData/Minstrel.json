The term also carried a more negative connotation among average folk compared to \"bard\", being used to refer to performers that they felt were of a mediocre or worse quality.\nThe minstrel profession involved singing ballads, playing a wide variety of instruments,\nThe ballads minstrels sang were usually of great events, such as the battle that ruined the Falling Tower, of far off lands, such as Rashemen and its Wychlaran or Thay and its Red Wizards, of local rumors, and love songs. \nIn addition to ballads, minstrels would dramatically recite poems, memorize crucial scenes from old plays, and sometimes modified popular songs with their own verses, such as The Ballad of the Dream Weaver or The Knights of Dragon Down.\nMinstrels were typically socially active individuals. They sometimes traveled in troupes. Besides other minstrels, these troupes could consist of bards, dancers, and spelldancers.\nMinstrels lacked the thorough, formal training and mastery of arcane magic that bards had. They also often lacked a bards grand skills in memorization, forcing them to rely upon books or other methods to aid them in recalling stories.\nUnlike average folk, guilds and positions or jobs that were court or noble-sponsored took the distinction between \"bard\" and \"minstrel\" quite seriously.\nMinstrels could be found throughout Toril. In Faer没n they were most commonly found in Cormyr, in the Border Kingdoms, in Dlusk, in Selgaunt, in Sembia, in Zhentil Keep, in northwest Faerun, in the Vast, and across the Sword Coast in cities such as Baldurs Gate, Berdusk, Beregost, and Waterdeep. Especially during the festival of Masks, in various establishments during Shieldmeet, and in the citys Jesters Court. Beyond the city itself, Waterdhavian minstrels could be found in Caer Callidyrr.\nFurther afield, minstrels could be found in the lands of Kara-Tur, such as in Shou Lung and Wa. Notably, the government of the Wanese city of Tifuido kept minstrels on a salary and had them play in the streets. In Chult, many a tabaxi lived as minstrels, traveling from settlement to settlement by themselves or in a troupe and garbed in bright clothes adorned with feathers and shells. Minstrels could be found across Zakhara, often at its bazaars selling their services for 3 to 5 gold pieces. And they could even be found in the Underdark, with deep gnomes being one of the races that commonly took up the profession. In the Elemental Plane of Air, there were djinn who lived as minstrels to entertain the noble djinni.\nA unique variety of minstrel, the elven minstrel, were common throughout the island of Evermeet and could be found traveling the byways of Faer没n. These were most often silver elves, though sometimes gold elves took up the profession, and minstrels of both races had very different styles of song.\nFesthalls, Inns, and restauraunts were seen to hire minstrels to play background music. Such as the Pride of the North, Everwyn House the Pleasing Platter, the Moonlight Touch, the Wizards Pit, the Jovial Juggler, and The Way Inn. As well as at clubs, such as the Osculatory, the Masked Mermaid, and The Three Towers.\nIn terms of religion, minstrels in Faer没n were drawn most often to the Church of Milil, whose Tuneservants protected and rescued minstrels across the land and whose musical deity Milil sometimes appeared in the form of an old minstrel. Beyond the Church of Milil, the clergy of the Church of Oghma often assisted, sponsored, and taught minstrels. And the clergy of the Church of Eilistraee were expected to pay any minstrel they met for an evensong or two.\nMany minstrels used tale sashes to help them in the memorization of stories and to provide audiences a visual of whatever they were telling.\nThe variety of instruments they played often included bells, harps, kazoos, lutes, and simply the stamping of their feet. In elven minstrelry, the harp and various flute-like horns were most prevalent.\nMinstrelry as a profession existed on Toril as far back as the days of Netheril, where the services of some could be purchased on the Karsus Enclave. Long after Netherils fall, elves of the Kingdom of Cormanthyr developed their own minstrels, the elven minstrel.\nMinstrels, along with caravan merchants and peddlers, were among the primary carriers of news and salacious rumors prior to the introduction of broadsheets. Though following the rise of broadsheets, minstrels were still valued in the 14 century DR by many as a source of news.\n* Aldegund Ruthlorn\n* Darbrukk Syndylver, a minstrel from Cormyr.\n* Glindlar, a minstrel from Westgate.\n* Ilmer Yuskalorn, a minstrel who was famous around the Inner Sea.\n* Jaladha Tshamryl\n* Lieshann\n* Llewellyn the Loquacious\n* Mamblat\n* Nymbrar Shatterslee\n* Roland the Minstrel\n* Sastram Vaerintel, a minstrel in Waterdeep.\n* Shalar Simgulphin, a fighter in Waterdeep\n* Shanna Northgate, a thief from Wheloon\n* Shrylla Manthar\n* Shymon and Scarbunkel, a minstrel duo that performed in tavern and inns across the Sword Coast North and northwest Faer没n in the late 14 century DR.\n* Sshansalue Wonderharp\n* Thalaeva Rynthar\n* Tan Nong\n* Waevor Talaphin, a half-elven minstrel and cartographer.\n* Windharrow\n* The avatar of Vergadain occasionally took the form of a traveling minstrel.\n* Olothontor was known as \"the Minstrel Wyrm\" and one of his life goals was to hear from the finest minstrels throughout the world.\n* A friendly minstrel was one of the forms that the shapechangers known as uthraki were often likely to take.\nMinstrel.jpg|A pair of minstrels in West Harbor.\nNoa-belfer-minstrel.jpg|Fanciful minstrels of the Sword Coast.\n*  \nCategoryProfessions\n10iiqfu2iin0qp1zjbmulnsqfmegex1"
