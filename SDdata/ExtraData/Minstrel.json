        "Etymology": "The term \"minstrel\" was often used interchangeably with \"[[bard]]\",{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-01-27 - How Bards Are Viewed Vs. Other Entertainers}} though there were distinctions between the two. The term also carried a more negative connotation among average folk compared to \"bard\", being used to refer to performers that they felt were of a mediocre or worse quality.",
        "Description": {
            "Distinction From Bards": "Minstrels lacked the thorough, formal training and mastery of [[arcane magic]] that bards had. They also often lacked a bard's grand skills in memorization, forcing them to rely upon [[book]]s or other methods to aid them in recalling stories.\n\nUnlike average folk, guilds and positions or jobs that were court or noble-sponsored took the distinction between \"bard\" and \"minstrel\" quite seriously."

        "Culture": "Minstrels could be found throughout [[Toril]]. In [[Faerûn]] they were most commonly found in [[Cormyr]],<ref> in the [[Border Kingdoms]],<ref> in [[Dlusk]],<ref> in [[Selgaunt]],{{Cite dragon/273/Shamur's Wager|57}} in [[Sembia]], in [[Zhentil Keep]],<ref> in [[northwest Faerun]],<ref> in [[the Vast]], and across the [[Sword Coast]] in cities such as [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Berdusk]], [[Beregost]],<ref> and [[Waterdeep]].<ref> Especially during the festival of [[Masks]], in various establishments during [[Shieldmeet]], and in the city's [[Jester's Court]].<ref> Beyond the city itself, Waterdhavian minstrels could be found in [[Caer Callidyrr]].<ref>\n\nFurther afield, minstrels could be found in the lands of [[Kara-Tur]], such as in [[Shou Lung]]<ref> and [[Wa]]. Notably, the government of the Wanese city of [[Tifuido]] kept minstrels on a salary and had them play in the streets.<ref> In [[Chult]], many a [[tabaxi]] lived as minstrels, traveling from settlement to settlement by themselves or in a troupe and garbed in bright clothes adorned with feathers and shells.<ref> Minstrels could be found across Zakhara, often at its bazaars selling their services for 3 to 5 [[gold piece]]s. And they could even be found in the [[Underdark]], with [[deep gnome]]s being one of the races that commonly took up the profession.<ref><ref> In the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], there were [[djinn]] who lived as minstrels to entertain the [[noble djinni]].<ref>\n\nA unique variety of minstrel, the [[elven minstrel]], were common throughout the island of [[Evermeet]] and could be found traveling the byways of Faerûn. These were most often [[silver elves]], though sometimes [[gold elves]] took up the profession, and minstrels of both races had very different styles of song.<ref>\n\nFesthalls, Inns, and restauraunts were seen to hire minstrels to play background music. Such as the [[Pride of the North]], [[Everwyn House]] the [[Pleasing Platter]],<ref> the [[Moonlight Touch]], the [[Wizard's Pit]],<ref> the [[Jovial Juggler]], and [[The Way Inn]].<ref> As well as at clubs, such as [[the Osculatory]], the [[Masked Mermaid]],<ref> and [[The Three Towers]].\n\nIn terms of religion, minstrels in Faerûn were drawn most often to the [[Church of Milil]], whose [[Tuneservant]]s protected and rescued minstrels across the land and whose musical deity [[Milil]] sometimes appeared in the form of an old minstrel.<ref> Beyond the Church of Milil, the clergy of the [[Church of Oghma]] often assisted, sponsored, and taught minstrels.<ref> And the clergy of the [[Church of Eilistraee]] were expected to pay any minstrel they met for an evensong or two.<ref>",
        "Equipment": "Many minstrels used [[Sash#Varities|tale sashes]] to help them in the memorization of stories and to provide audiences a visual of whatever they were telling.\n\nThe variety of instruments they played often included [[bell]]s, [[harp]]s, [[kazoo]]s, [[lute]]s, and simply the stamping of their feet.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/save/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_080910-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Aug–Oct 2004 | accessdate = 12-03-2022| date = 25-11-2021}} In elven minstrelry, the harp and various [[flute]]-like horns were most prevalent.<ref>",
        "History": "Minstrelry as a profession existed on Toril as far back as the days of [[Netheril]], where the services of some could be purchased on the [[Karsus Enclave]].<ref> Long after Netheril's fall, elves of the Kingdom of [[Cormanthyr]] developed their own minstrels, the elven minstrel.<ref>\n\nMinstrels, along with caravan merchants and peddlers, were among the primary carriers of news and salacious rumors prior to the introduction of [[broadsheet]]s.<ref> Though following the rise of broadsheets, minstrels were still valued in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by many as a source of news.",
