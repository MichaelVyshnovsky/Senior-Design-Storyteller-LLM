This was the time of the fabled creator races, or Iquar-TelQuessir in the elven tongue, and many other races still hid in caves. \nThe Days of Thunder began when the majority of the glaciers left by the cooling of Abeir-Torils ocean during the Shadow Epoch finally revealed a supercontinent that would eventually be called Merrouroboros. Life bloomed on this landmass in the form of the creator races and the ancient ape-like ancestors of humans.\nEmpires of the sarrukh, a sauroid creator race, arose around . The first was the realm of Okoth, which came to dominate much of the land that would be Faerûn over the next century.\nAround , the sarrukh empire of Mhairshaulk was founded on the Chultan Peninsula.\nAround , the sarrukh empire of Isstosseffifil was founded in the lands that would become Anauroch.\nAround , Okoth fell after a century of civil unrest that caused many sarrukh to travel into the planes.\nAround , the sarrukh founded the Baetith.\nAround , the sarrukh empire of Mhairshaulk began its decline. The nation became the preserve of the yuan-ti.\nThe batrachi were an amphibious race who evolved in the seas, their growth mirroring the sarrukh on land. When they became amphibious, they moved onto the land and supplanted the dinosauroids. The Batrachi Empires rose to power circa .\nThe batrachi grew to the height of their power under the wise leadership of Zhoukoudien, the High One. However, their golden age ended abruptly when the High One was killed in battle by Omo, a titan thane of the Jotunbrud Tribes, around . \nAround , the batrachi were losing a war against the titans and desperately enacted a great summoning ritual that unleashed several once-imprisoned primordials. The gods swiftly opposed the primordials. The primordial Asgorath, the World Shaper, even hurled an ice moon or comet at the planet, in order to destroy what she could not have, in an event called the Tearfall. Disastrous earthquakes, fires, and windstorms swept across all of Abeir-Toril, erasing whole continents and rearranging the seas, causing the four Inner Seas to merge into the Sea of Fallen Stars. Ancient sarrukh legends made cryptic mention of the \"changing of the stars\". But, before the world was destroyed, Ao split it into two twin worlds Abeir for the primordials and Toril for the gods.\nAt around this time, the first dragons eggs hatched all over Toril, number in the tens of thousands.\nThe extreme climate change swiftly led to the end of batrachi civilization. After a cold period called \"the seven-turn winter\", many batrachi left Toril for the plane of Limbo. Meanwhile, in the seas, the amphibioids appear to have faced pressure from merfolk, sahuagin, and tritons. Their society degenerated and collapsed back into barbarism.\nMeanwhile, there arose the Aearee Empires. The aearee, an avian creator race, were the creators of the aarakocra, kenku, and other birdlike humanoids.\nAround , a number of lammasu defeated a much larger force of Aearee-Krocaa, killing one thousand. The aearee later experimented on domesticated landwyrms to create winged wyrms, or wyverns. Supported by wyvern forces, the Aearee-Krocaa empire commenced a rapid expansion.\nAround , the gnolls of Urgnarash battled the aearee of Kookrui-Shara. Gnoll shamans, following Yeenoghu, summoned marrashi to spread disease among the aearee. Aearee crops were blighted, and the aearee suffered the Wasting Plague. The Aearee-Quor were decimated, and many of them began worshiping the demon lord Pazrael to seek salvation."
