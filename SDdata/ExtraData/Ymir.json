            "Fabled History": "According to the legends spoken by worshipers of the Norse pantheon, in the earlier days of the [[multiverse]] the fiery realm of [[Muspelheim]] and its hot gusts of wind clashed with a realm of rime and ice<ref group=\"note\" name=\"fable\" /> to the north of it, at a deep abyss called the Ginnungagap. There the ice melted, creating earth and bodies of icy water, from which came Ymir and a gigantic [[cow]] named Audhumla. The continued heat of Muspelheim made Ymir sweat and, either while he was awake growing strong off of Audhumla's milk or while he was asleep, those droplets of sweat formed into what the Norse faith believed to be the first [[frost giant]]s.\n\nFour rivers of milk flowed from the udders of Audhumla, which sustained both Ymir and the first giants, while the cow sustained herself on salty rime stones and the [[salt]] from ice floes. Her lickings eventually unearthed a giant of a man named Buri. From his came a son, who married a giantess. And from their coupling came three boys, the first of the [[Aesir]], one of whom was [[Odin]]. According to some, the giants began waging a war against the Aesir, but most accounts spoke of the Aesir acting first, believing there to be only [[evil]] in the hearts of the giants. Whichever way it was told, their conflict always ended with the death of Ymir. Blood gushed forth from Ymir's body, flooding the Ginnungagap where the giants had made their home, drowning all but two. Those two giants managed to escape from the Aesir, swearing eternal vengeance upon their pantheon, and allegedly fostered the rest of the giant race.\n\nThese legends conclude by saying that Odin and his brothers harvested Ymir's remains to create the world, with some going into lengthy detail about which parts of him were used to create what. And that from [[maggot]]s found within his body, the three Aesir were said by those of the Norse faith to have created the [[Ysgardian dwarves]], [[Ysgardian troll]]s, [[elves]], and [[fey]].",
            "Known History": "Ymir was believed by some giants in Jotunheim, such as the frost giant [[Utgard-Loki]], to be the true progenitor of giants held the name \"Skull-Throne of Ymir\". though in actuality he was the son of [[Annam All-Father]], the true progenitor of the giants.<ref><ref><ref group=\"note\" name=\"fable\" />"
