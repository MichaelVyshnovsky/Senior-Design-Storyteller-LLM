            "General": "* This concept was of concern to many [[neutral]] [[deities]]\n* [[Neutral good]] beings often believed in the importance of the Balance, but felt that the concerns of law and chaos did not moderate the need for good in the multiverse. Given the many creatures of the cosmos that were all striving for different goals, this understanding taught that determinedly pursuing good would not upset the Balance and might even go to maintaining it.",

Over the course of spending time among the other races of Toril for over eight hundred years, Aurus came to the conclusion that the Cosmic Balance was the driving force behind existence. He also felt that he had a responsibility to contribute in some small part to maintaining it.<ref>\n* The god [[Cyric]] believed his role in upholding the Balance was to slay any of his fellow deities that demonstrated weakness. His charge was validated by the overgod Ao. Ironically, Cyric did not care about maintaining the Balance, and insisted his own death would disrupt it.\n* The [[wizard]] [[Mordenkainen]] was an adherent of the Balance and would intervene throughout the cosmos to maintain it, seeing himself as a chief instrument of the concept.",
            "Magic": "* The [[divine]] [[spell]] ''[[analyze balance]]'' would reveal to a priest or [[monk]] how far a creature, object, or area diverted from the absolute center of the Balance, consequently allowing the caster to determine the target's alignment.\n* The ''[[Tablets of Fate]]'' created by Ao included upon them the specifics of how the gods of Toril would maintain the Balance.",

Their primary focus was on Flanaess, a major region on their home world of Oerth, making sure no one power gained dominance over too much of the region.\n* Many of the neutral-aligned deities of [[Krynnspace]] sought to maintain the Balance in their crystal sphere.",

            "Individuals": "* [[Girru]] of the [[Untheric pantheon]] was a proponent of the Balance, acknowledging that the existence of evil was necessary, yet he still fought ferociously against its forces. Even sending his [[Celestial archon|archons]] and priests out to destroy sources of malevolence.<ref>\n* [[Primus]], the immortal ruler of the lawful neutral plane of [[Mechanus]] and the creator of its inhabitants, the [[modron]]s, was an enigmatic figure whose goals were uncertain.{{Cite dragon/414/Ecology of the Modron|7}} Some believed he was a manifestation of order, who instilled in the modrons the purpose of advancing the ideals of law and making it a dominant force in the multiverse. According to some legends, Primus once threatened the Balance by creating the law-infused [[Slaad#Spawning_Stone|Spawning Stone]], which he threw into [[Limbo]] in an effort to bring order to that plane and hinder the spread of Chaos. But others believed that the modrons (and by extension Primus) sought to maintain the Balance, describing them as the \"keepers of the machinery of the multiverse\", such as by sending the modrons against the [[tanar'ri]] whenever they gained too much ground in the Blood War.",
            "Races & Sentient Creatures": "* Some [[celestial]]s argued that marching against the fiends would result in a conflict that, assuming the celestials were not annihilated, would create a conflict of such sheer magnitude that the very fabric of the multiverse would be torn apart. The most heated debate on the subject brought up a sub-branch of the Balance concept called the \"Ethical Paradox\", the belief that good could not exist without evil, and thus that destroying the fiends would doom the multiverse.\n* The [[aasimon]] of neutral good deities believed in the importance of the Balance, but would tip the scales in the favor of Good whenever the opportunity presented itself.<ref>\n* [[Guardinal]]s, the neutral good defenders of [[Elysium]] and [[Mount Celestia]], focused on defending their planes,\n* [[Night hag]]s viewed the multiverse as a twisted sort of balance of ever-conflicting forces, but due to their selfish nature they did not care which force the scales were tipped in favor of.\n* [[Slaad]]i were a race of beings interested in the spread and triumph of Chaos over the other forces. However, there were conflicting reports and theories that claimed, if enough time was spent on a plane of either extreme Good or Evil, a slaad would feel compelled to maintain the Balance by acting in a manner opposite of the plane. One example was [[Grellon|Grellon the Green]], a benevolent [[green slaad]] that traveled the Lower Planes."

The concept was in direct opposition to the [[Blood War]] and the very notion that eventually either chaotic evil or [[lawful evil]] would triumph over the other in the conflict, becoming the only form of evil in the multiverse. Additionally, adherents of the Balance often interfered in the Blood War to prevent either outcome from ever occurring.\n* [[The Way]] philosophy of [[Kara-Tur]] espoused that there was no such thing as the forces of Good, Evil, Law, or Chaos&mdash;they were merely labels thrust upon the fundamental forces of the universe. One of its two sects, the Light Way, espoused maintaining the natural balance of the world and events, though this is not necessarily the same as the Balance, depending as it does on wholly different forces.{{speculation}} In fact, the central concept of [[Wikipedia:Yin and Yang|Yin and Yang]] illustrated the interconnection of opposing forces and two opposing forces being partially composed of the other, involves a very different notion of balance.{{speculation}}",
        "Disrupting the Balance": "Within Toril's crystal sphere, there were a number of ways deities could be found guilty of disrupting the Balance. Notable among these were by impersonating other deities, and infringing upon their duties by acting outside their own divine purview.\n\nDisruptions in the Balance could alter worlds on the [[Prime Material plane]]. When the goddess [[Mystra]] died on planet [[Toril]] during the [[Time of Troubles]], the very \"fabric of reality\" surrounding her was worn thin. The Landscape around [[Helmlands|the site]] of her death became transmutable, and the various deities of the Faerûnian pantheon each took turns modifying it to reflect their divine nature.",
        "History": "The Faerûnian goddess [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] was formally tried for disrupting the Balance by her fellow gods in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. She was granted clemency by reason of her previous existence as a mortal of Toril.",
