This concept is also not to be confused with \"the balance\" that concerned nature deities like Sheela Peryroyl and Solonor Thelandira, as that referred to a balance between civilization/agriculture versus untamed wilderness. under the notion that none of them could exist without their counterpart.In 1st and 2nd edition, druids were written as being aligned \"true neutral\" due to the forms of \"balance\" they observed, though later editions allowed them to be any form of neutral. Because of the former, the Cosmic Balance cannot purport to be the principle behind all forms of true neutrality. Different conceptions of the Balance disagreed on whether it was a fundamental requirement of being, and thus that for reality to exist things could be no other way, or if it could hypothetically be replaced were circumstances to change.\nVery few mortals or entities fully embraced the Balance, since it required a grasp of events on a cosmic level and those who vowed to maintain it often made enemies. However, some embraced the Balance simply to further their own personal quests for power. Some of those in the multiverse who both believed in and adhered to the concept of the Balance included the following.\n* This concept was of concern to many neutral deities\n* Neutral good beings often believed in the importance of the Balance, but felt that the concerns of law and chaos did not moderate the need for good in the multiverse. Given the many creatures of the cosmos that were all striving for different goals, this understanding taught that determinedly pursuing good would not upset the Balance and might even go to maintaining it.\n* Ao, the overgod of Realmspace, was one of the most notable neutral deity proponents of cosmic balance in that crystal sphere. He carried out his duties in service to an unknown luminous being, and was aided in his charge by the Faer没nian God of Justice, Tyr.\n* Aurus, a gold dragon of great wyrm age. Over the course of spending time among the other races of Toril for over eight hundred years, Aurus came to the conclusion that the Cosmic Balance was the driving force behind existence. He also felt that he had a responsibility to contribute in some small part to maintaining it.\n* The god Cyric believed his role in upholding the Balance was to slay any of his fellow deities that demonstrated weakness. His charge was validated by the overgod Ao. Ironically, Cyric did not care about maintaining the Balance, and insisted his own death would disrupt it.\n* The wizard Mordenkainen was an adherent of the Balance and would intervene throughout the cosmos to maintain it, seeing himself as a chief instrument of the concept.\n* The divine spell analyze balance would reveal to a priest or monk how far a creature, object, or area diverted from the absolute center of the Balance, consequently allowing the caster to determine the targets alignment.\n* The Tablets of Fate created by Ao included upon them the specifics of how the gods of Toril would maintain the Balance.\n* There existed a cult on Toril that worshiped the concept.\n* The Circle of Greater Powers of the Faer没nian pantheon were expected to maintain the Balance while carrying out their divine duties in service to their worshipers on Toril.\n* Members of the Waterdhavian Cult of Ao strove, in emulation of the overgod, to maintain the Balance among their fellow faiths.\n* On Oerth there existed the Circle of Eight, a group of powerful wizards that Mordenkainen was a member of, who were adherents of the Balance and would intervene to maintain it. Their primary focus was on Flanaess, a major region on their home world of Oerth, making sure no one power gained dominance over too much of the region.\n* Many of the neutral-aligned deities of Krynnspace sought to maintain the Balance in their crystal sphere.\n* Petitioners of the Outlands instinctively observed the Balance, feeling that every action they took needed to be offset by an equal action of opposite alignment.\n* The rilmani, a race native to the Outlands, devoted their entire lives to maintaining the Balance, no matter the cost or repercussions. They monitored and addressed imbalances throughout the Great Wheel, the Elemental planes, and on the Prime Material plane.\nThe following entities fell into the concept of the Balance or acknowledged its existence, but made no effort to actually maintain it like those above.\n* Chaotic evil beings often believed in such a thing as the Balance, but due to their selfishness did not care about maintaining it.\n* The agents of the Upper Planes often believed in the existence of a Cosmic Balance, but strove to tilt it in the favor of Good.\n* Girru of the Untheric pantheon was a proponent of the Balance, acknowledging that the existence of evil was necessary, yet he still fought ferociously against its forces. Even sending his archons and priests out to destroy sources of malevolence.\n* Primus, the immortal ruler of the lawful neutral plane of Mechanus and the creator of its inhabitants, the modrons, was an enigmatic figure whose goals were uncertain. Some believed he was a manifestation of order, who instilled in the modrons the purpose of advancing the ideals of law and making it a dominant force in the multiverse. According to some legends, Primus once threatened the Balance by creating the law-infused Spawning Stone, which he threw into Limbo in an effort to bring order to that plane and hinder the spread of Chaos. But others believed that the modrons (and by extension Primus) sought to maintain the Balance, describing them as the \"keepers of the machinery of the multiverse\", such as by sending the modrons against the tanarri whenever they gained too much ground in the Blood War.\n* Some celestials argued that marching against the fiends would result in a conflict that, assuming the celestials were not annihilated, would create a conflict of such sheer magnitude that the very fabric of the multiverse would be torn apart. The most heated debate on the subject brought up a sub-branch of the Balance concept called the \"Ethical Paradox\", the belief that good could not exist without evil, and thus that destroying the fiends would doom the multiverse.\n* The aasimon of neutral good deities believed in the importance of the Balance, but would tip the scales in the favor of Good whenever the opportunity presented itself.\n* Guardinals, the neutral good defenders of Elysium and Mount Celestia, focused on defending their planes,\n* Night hags viewed the multiverse as a twisted sort of balance of ever-conflicting forces, but due to their selfish nature they did not care which force the scales were tipped in favor of.\n* Slaadi were a race of beings interested in the spread and triumph of Chaos over the other forces. However, there were conflicting reports and theories that claimed, if enough time was spent on a plane of either extreme Good or Evil, a slaad would feel compelled to maintain the Balance by acting in a manner opposite of the plane. One example was Grellon the Green, a benevolent green slaad that traveled the Lower Planes.\n* Chaotic neutral beings typically believed that there was no such thing as a careful balance of forces in the multiverse.\n* Some celestials did not believe in the Balance from either a political or universally fundamental framework, believing the combined forces of good stood a chance to wipe evil from the multiverse.\n* Those who inhabited the Lower planes, such as fiends, didnt believe in the Balance. The concept was in direct opposition to the Blood War and the very notion that eventually either chaotic evil or lawful evil would triumph over the other in the conflict, becoming the only form of evil in the multiverse. Additionally, adherents of the Balance often interfered in the Blood War to prevent either outcome from ever occurring.\n* The Way philosophy of Kara-Tur espoused that there was no such thing as the forces of Good, Evil, Law, or Chaos&mdashthey were merely labels thrust upon the fundamental forces of the universe. One of its two sects, the Light Way, espoused maintaining the natural balance of the world and events, though this is not necessarily the same as the Balance, depending as it does on wholly different forces. In fact, the central concept of Yin and Yang illustrated the interconnection of opposing forces and two opposing forces being partially composed of the other, involves a very different notion of balance.\nWithin Torils crystal sphere, there were a number of ways deities could be found guilty of disrupting the Balance. Notable among these were by impersonating other deities, and infringing upon their duties by acting outside their own divine purview.\nDisruptions in the Balance could alter worlds on the Prime Material plane. When the goddess Mystra died on planet Toril during the Time of Troubles, the very \"fabric of reality\" surrounding her was worn thin. The Landscape around the site of her death became transmutable, and the various deities of the Faer没nian pantheon each took turns modifying it to reflect their divine nature.\nThe Faer没nian goddess Mystra was formally tried for disrupting the Balance by her fellow gods in the . She was granted clemency by reason of her previous existence as a mortal of Toril. \n* Paronder, a karmic concept of \"cosmic balance\" for magic in Realmspace.\nCategoryOther Religions\nCategoryPhilosophies\nbt2q7h5797laebi5xklh9hwmxyxjvc8"
