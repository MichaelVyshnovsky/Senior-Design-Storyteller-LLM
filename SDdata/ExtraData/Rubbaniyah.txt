'''''Rubbaniyah''''' was the term used to describe an officer of a sailing vessel in [[Zakhara]].

==Activities==
Though not required, especially on smaller vessels, ''rubbaniyah'' were useful in delegating lesser duties to shipmates so the ''[[rubban]]'' and ''[[nakhuda]]'' could focus on other things.
