[[File:Narbondel.png|thumb|''A view of magically illuminated Narbondel.'']]
The '''Narbondel''' was a huge stalagmite in the city of [[Menzoberranzan]] and served as a clock for its inhabitants.

==History==
At one time, the [[drow]] [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]] found [[Menzoberra]]'s tomb within Narbondel and took the ''[[Dagger of Menzoberra]]'' back to the city.

During the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], the clocktower was bathed in searing flames that blinded those who looked upon it with [[darkvision]].

==Structure==
Narbondel was the only unshaped piece of stone within the boundaries of the city cavern and it was used as a clock. At the end of every day, the [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]] cast magic upon the stone to heat it. The heat from the Archmage's spell formed a band around it and moved up. When the end of the glow was at the pillar's top, the day was almost done.

===Tomb of Menzoberra===
Besides being the clock of Menzoberranzan, the stone pillar housed a much greater secret. Within the stalagmite, the ancestors built the tomb of the legendary founder of the city itself, Menzoberra the Kinless. From the top of the pillar, a secret stair lead to the hidden chamber where the body of the priestess once lay in a cocoon upon a huge [[spider]]'s web spanning a tremendous abyss. When Zaknafein took the Dagger of Menzoberra, the spider's web crashed and the cocoon with the corpse fell into the depths.
