There were at least nine runes of chaos.\nThe runes of chaos were a key part of the operation of the dread artifact Thakorsils Seat. The horrid ritual of twin burnings—which involved the sacrifice, body and soul, of a good mage—created a crystal pane bearing one of the runes of chaos around the Seat. With all nine runes of chaos in place, a victim trapped in the chair was eternally bound to it and enslaved to the will of its owner.\nCategoryMagic\nCategoryRunes and sigils\ntrd8e2o7h19by5i2x5ma7elj8vo85lq"
