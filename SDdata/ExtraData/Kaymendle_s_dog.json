This name is chosen by similarity with the pattern for Kaymendle bolts, but as there is only one, it is referred to as Kaymendles dog, rather than a Kaymendle dog. was an apparition created by Kaymendle Skrip, extant in Harrowdale in the 14 century DR. It reacted to clouds, predicting rain.\nThe apparition resembled a fat war dog made of cloudstuff.\nThe dog mostly responded to incoming rain it whined hours before light rain came, barked when typical summer rain clouds were approaching, and howled in advance of heavy rain.\nKaymendle Skrip created Kaymendles dog for the farmers of southern Harrowdale, expecting its barking would scare away storm clouds. It failed at that task, as the clouds ignored the dog. However, it remained until at least the 14 century DR, when it was still visible over southern Harrowdale."
