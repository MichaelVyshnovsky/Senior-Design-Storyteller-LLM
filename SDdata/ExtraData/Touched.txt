The touched were mages that Mystra commissioned for a task, offering a small amount of power in exchange.
When Mystra liked a mages character, she sometimes appeared to them in private as a blue radiance and offered them power in exchange for a service.
The tasks of the Touched could be small indeed, such as casting spells of wild magic into a dead magic zone, or they could be more major, such as destroying an enchanted object at a particular, dangerous location. Even political tasks could be asked of one so touched.
The touched were never quite sure what their powers were, and sometimes learned those only in the moment, as a surprise realization that something they thought impossible became possible.
* The ability to notice hostile magic working within 
* A single-use spell appearing in their mind, sometimes even beyond their own power
* The maximization of a spells power, when cast in battle
* Instant recovery of a spell, without memorization involved
* The ability to hurl a spell by an act of pure will, with no components
* Instant spell reflection of any three spells, though never dispel magic
* dimension door thrice a day.
After completion, though the powers vanished, they usually kept some minor magic, such as a light or feather fall spell useable at will, or a strong resistance to one school of magic. Those who missed the power overmuch could petition to become a Pursuivant Arcane, or even a weavespinner.
