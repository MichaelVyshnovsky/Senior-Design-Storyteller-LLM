        "mainbody": "BioWare Corp is a Canadian entertainment software company best known for its roleplaying games, including a number of Forgotten Realms computer game titles.\nBioWare was founded in Edmonton, Canada in 1995 by medical students Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk. After initially developing Shattered Steel in 1996, BioWare went on to develop Baldurs Gate for Black Isle Studios in 1998, their first out of many contributions to the Forgotten Realms license. Baldurs Gate proved to be both a smash success and critically acclaimed and in 1999 the developer put out an expansion pack, Baldurs Gate Tales of the Sword Coast, followed by a sequel, Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn in 2000, which was even more acclaimed and acquired another expansion pack, Baldurs Gate II Throne of Bhaal in 2001.\nIn 2002, BioWare released its last stand-alone Forgotten Realms game to date, Neverwinter Nights, which, again, proved a critical and commercial success. BioWare continued support for the game, releasing two story-based expansions (Neverwinter Nights Shadows of Undrentide and Neverwinter Nights Hordes of the Underdark) as well as several downloadable \"premium modules\" and the Neverwinter Nights Kingmaker expansion pack. BioWare would later also provide limited oversight over Obsidian Entertainments development of the sequel, released in 2006.\nIn 2005, BioWare merged with Pandemic Studios which were later both acquired by Electronic Arts in late 2007. BioWares most recent release was Dragon Age Origins - Awakening, an expansion to Dragon Age Origins, which BioWare billed as a \"spiritual successor\" to Baldurs Gate.\n*[http//www.bioware.com Bioware.com]\nCategoryVideo game developers\n9rkpyx62rtahfqiumq3jqa2q5vqeohq"
