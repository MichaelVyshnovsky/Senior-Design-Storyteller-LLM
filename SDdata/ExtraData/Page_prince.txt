A page prince was a stage in the life of a noble-born drow male.
A page prince must personally cater to the Matron Mothers every whim (more so than usual). Page princes were not deemed nobles until they had completed the training required of them. It was the task of the house elderboy to train the page prince in manners.
When a noble drow male was ten years of age and his weanmother had finished with him, he became a page prince. He was treated as such until deemed ready to become a noble by the noble females of the house.
