        "mainbody": "His (or Her) Resplendence, the King of Justice (or the Queen of Justice) was a title used by the ruler of gold dragon society. The title was created because the gold dragons, the most lawful of the dragon species, felt the necessity to create the most orderly of societies.\nThe King of Justice was usually the oldest and most powerful gold dragon of a given region. Although the dragons held official elections when it was necessary to fill the position, the King of Justice was almost always chosen by acclamation. If the two most promising candidates of a given election were male and female, then, instead of elections, they took the Oath of Concord (the dragon equivalent of marriage) and shared responsibilities and authorities equally as Their Resplendences.\nUnlike most human kings, the Kings and Queens of Justice didnt actually rule gold dragon society. Instead, they acted as advisors, giving guidance to those who sought them for their wisdom, Kings and Queens of Justice only made decisions when a situation affected the race as a whole.\nIn western Faerûn some time before the 14 century DR, a particularly powerful gold dragon named Protanther was the King of Justice.\nBy the mid–14 century, the King of Justice was Lareth,\nSucceeding him as King of Justice was Tamarand, who still had the title as of 1479 DR."
