Scrying was the magical ability to use ones senses to experience events far away.
Many divination spells of the scrying subschool created a magical sensor that sent the caster information. The sensor had the sensory acuity of the caster and acted as though it were a separate, independent organ. Any intelligent creature could notice an active magical sensor. The sensor could be dispelled.
Scrying could not penetrate lead, with lead sheeting or high concentrations in natural rock being effective barriers. Some buildings such as the House of the Moon had a lead lining in their outer walls for this purpose.
Several magic spells, antimagic field, mind blank, nondetection, The semi-precious stone tchazar could blur the scrying of anything close to it.
A chrysoberyl gem (aka "cats eye") could be used for short-range but very detailed scrying.
