'''The Xanathar''' ({{Pronounce|ZAN|ah|thar|refs=}}) was a title held by the [[beholder]] leader of the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]], a crime organization active in [[Waterdeep]] and [[Skullport]]. Many beholders held the title of Xanathar during the guild's history.

==History==
===Arrival of Xanathar and the Eye===
[[Xanathar (original)|Xanathar]] was the [[true name]] of a beholder of the [[Anauria|Anaurian Hive]] who ran a group called the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild that had attained significant power over the criminal underworld in Waterdeep by [[1358 DR]].{{Cite dungeon/206/The Xanathar: Crime Lord of Waterdeep|38}} Xanathar was a follower of [[Xantriph]] who arrived in Waterdeep in a trading caravan from [[Zhentil Keep]], tasked with deposing the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] and replacing them with a ruler friendly to the [[Zhentarim]].

Upon his<ref group="note">While beholders were genderless, most sourcebooks refer to Xanathar as masculine. arrival, Xanathar realized Waterdeep had no [[thieves' guild]]; its former thieves' guild, the [[Shadow Thieves]], had been crushed and driven into [[Amn]] by [[Lhestyn]] years earlier in [[1298 DR]]. Xanathar decided to defy his masters by abandoning his mission and filling the power vacuum in Waterdeep's crime underworld. He set up a hideout in the sewers beneath Waterdeep and organized an unofficial thieves' guild, working indirectly through freelancers to avoid detection from the Lords of Waterdeep.

An [[elder orb]] beholder, named [[Kirukeskai]] and nicknamed the Eye, had arrived in Skullport in [[1205 DR]].

===Death of Xanathar===
By [[1304 DR]] the Agents of the Eye were feared and respected throughout Skullport. Kirukeskai continued to grow in wisdom and experience even as its magical powers waned with age. By the mid-1300s DR, Kirukeskai sought new opportunities to increase its influence and turned its attention to the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild.

According to some sources, Kirukeskai killed Xanathar some time in the late 1360s DR. Over a ten year investigation, Kirukeskai determined that the guild's leader Xanathar was a beholder from a different hive. Seeking to gather more power and eliminate a rival, Kirukeskai located Xanathar's lair and tricked another Graypeaks Hive beholder of Skullport, Uthh, into attacking Xanathar in the Waterdeep sewers. Xanathar defeated Uthh, but Kirukeskai slew Xanathar in his weakened condition.

According to other sources, Xanathar was killed by the [[Heroes of Waterdeep]] in [[1358 DR]], under orders from the [[Lords of Waterdeep]].<ref group="note" name="contra">The computer game ''[[Eye of the Beholder]]'' and the [[Dungeon magazine 206|''Dungeon'' #206]] article "The Xanathar: Crime Lord of Waterdeep" contradict other canon sources regarding the deaths of Xanathar and Kirukeskai.

===Reign of the Eye===
[[File:Xanathar 3e.JPG|right|thumb|''Kirukeskai, the Eye''.]]
After Xanathar's death, Kirukeskai took over Xanathar's guild, absorbing the guild's operations and contacts. Kirukeskai instructed its new agents to call it "the Xanathar" to make the name seem a title. Most of Xanathar's agents were [[charm]]ed or threatened into loyalty. Outside of ranking members of Xanathar's guild, no one was aware of the change in power. In the guise of the Xanathar, Kirukeskai was able to expand its operations into Waterdeep. It further consolidated its power by killing Seirtych Xantaun, another Graypeaks Hive beholder running a smuggling operation in Skullport.

By 1370 DR, Kirukeskai wielded great power in Skullport and Waterdeep, controlling one third of the slave trade in Skullport and exploring the possibility of promoting an agent to serve as a Lord of Waterdeep.

Kirukeskai was either killed by adventurers In [[1479 DR]], an ancient blind beholder known as the [[Blind]] was living in Skullport, claiming to be the Eye and seeking a [[relic]] to restore his former power and secure revenge against Avaereene.<ref name="Dungeon200-73 />

===Subsequent successions===
After Kirukeskai's death, a third beholder assumed the role and title of the Xanathar. Over the years, many more beholders claimed the title, some by killing the previous Xanathar and some by peaceful succession. The [[elder orb|elder beholder]] Xandulzrithral chose retirement to escape the role's dangers. The activities of other Waterdhavian beholders such as [[Xlorothxrau]], commonly known as Lothjaws, were often mistaken for the work of the Xanathar. The Xanathars usually enjoyed seeing others blamed for their crimes.

[[Izulktur]] held the title of Xanathar for a short time. It was originally part of a cluster working with four beholders, and continued to magically communicate and share information about Waterdeep with the cluster after assuming the title. Eventually Izulktur grew bored with the restrictive secrecy and confinement of the title, and ordered the cluster to send a replacement.{{Cite dungeon/206/The Xanathar: Crime Lord of Waterdeep|39}}

===Reign of Zushaxx===
[[File:Xanathar-5e.jpg|right|thumb|''Zushaxx, the Xanathar as of 1479 DR.'']]
[[Volothamp Geddarm]] documents in ''[[Volo's Guide to Monsters (in-universe)|Volo's Guide to Monsters]]'' that Zushaxx was Xanathar by the late 15th century DR. Zushaxx spent much of its first year reading through the library amassed by its predecessor Xanathars; exposure to the library drove its thirst for knowledge. Zushaxx showed a willingness to take chances to increase its power and considered revealing its true identity as a beholder beyond its trusted inner circle. 

Zushaxx was a paranoid, megalomaniacal leader and rarely left its secret lair, a dungeon complex of [[Netherese]] origin connected to Skullport and Waterdeep's sewers. Zushaxx craved information and sought to expand its power. Its ultimate goals included installing an agent in [[Candlekeep]]'s library to receive copies of its lore and controlling the entire region of [[Undermountain]] and Skullport. 

By [[1492 DR]], Zushaxx openly controlled Skullport and turned the city into a haven for the Xanathar's Thieves' Guild. Under its rule, most local businesses were shut down, with the few remaining in business paying it protection money. Zushaxx was feuding with the Zhentarim after attempts at an alliance with the Xanathar Guild collapsed. The conflict between the Xanathar's Guild and the Zhentarim erupted into public violence on the streets of Waterdeep.

==Knowledge of the Xanathar's identity==
Prior to the reign of Zushaxx, all Xanathars closely guarded the fact that the Xanathar was a title held by a succession of beholder crime lords. They took extreme measures to keep their true nature shrouded, rarely leaving their hidden underground lairs, maintaining and swapping between multiple lairs, and regularly abandoning lairs after a few years.{{Cite dungeon/206/The Xanathar: Crime Lord of Waterdeep|42}}  At least one Xanathar, Izulktur, retired because of the demands of secrecy. Even within the Xathathar's Guild, only a few trusted underlings knew the true nature of the title, or even that their leader was a beholder.

Zushaxx, the reigning Xanathar of the late 15<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]],

Most Waterdhavians were broadly aware of the existence of guilds controlling criminal activity in Waterdeep, and occasionally heard rumors of a monstrous [[demon]]ic or draconic crime lord ruling in secrecy. These rumors were largely dismissed by commoners, who believed that the Lords of Waterdeep would never stand for such creatures in the city.

Several prominent individuals were aware of the title's true nature. In 1491 DR, these included at least two Lords of Waterdeep, the [[Lords of Waterdeep#Masked Lords|Masked Lord]] [[Mirt]] and the [[Lords of Waterdeep#Open Lord|Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]]. The [[Chosen of Mystra]] had known about the nature of the title for centuries. [[Halaster Blackcloak]] was also aware, and considered the succession of Xanathars a useful distraction.

==Known Xanathars==
At least thirteen Xanathars preceded Zushaxx. During Zushaxx's reign, the Crypt of Xanathars Past in the Xanathar's secret lair contained the remains of thirteen previous Xanathars: four dead beholders preserved in [[embalming fluid]] and nine urns holding the dust of disintegrated beholders. 

The names of the following Xanathars were known:
*[[Xanathar]], a former Zhentarim agent who founded the Xanathar Thieves' Guild in Waterdeep.
*[[Kirukeskai]], a slaver who founded the Agents of the Eye and took over Xanathar's name and organization after his death.
*[[Xandulzrithral]], an elder beholder who retired peacefully from the title.
*[[Izulktur]], a member of a cluster of beholders who retired after growing bored.
*[[Zushaxx]], an ambitious, paranoid megalomaniac who gained full control of Skullport.
