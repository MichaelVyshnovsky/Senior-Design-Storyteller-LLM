Originally, druids were granted unlimited access and clerics were granted minor access to these spells.  Optionally, clerics were denied these spells.\nMany spells were available to those who had chosen this sphere.\nBeginner spellcasters of this sphere could cast\n* wind column\nNovice divine spellcasters were able to cast\n* dust devil\nSomewhat skilled spellcasters were able to cast\n* water/air breathingThis spell was removed from the elemental air sphere in the Players Option Spells & Magic sourcebook. See page 186. Since this spell is reversible and is applicable to allowing water-breathing creatures to survive in air, this is probably a misprint.\n* wind servant\n* zone of sweet air\nIntermediate clerics and druids had the ability to cast\n* windborne\nThose with a high level of skill had access to\n* air walk\n* cloud of purificationThis spell was designated as belonging to both the elemental air sphere and elemental water sphere on page 89 of the Tome of Magic 2nd edition.
