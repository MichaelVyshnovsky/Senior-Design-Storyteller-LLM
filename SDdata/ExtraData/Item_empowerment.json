        "mainbody": "tem empowerment was the process by which a psionicist could imbue a weapon with power, similar to the process of magical enchantment.  \nEvery item that was imbued with psionic power was also instilled with an intelligent personality, capable of communication with any would-be user. This persona was influenced by the feelings and mindset of the psionic crafter, specifically during the time of the items creation. If the user developed a relationship withe personality within their empowered item, it would typically function with higher efficacy.\nIt was noteworthy that items created via psionic powers could not be detected by magical divinations.\nUnlike how  a mage would use specific spells from a variety of schools of magic, psionicists could only use powers from a single science or devotion. Also, items that were to be empowered would have to be of the highest quality. \nDespite the differences in the nature between their respective sources of power, psionically empowered and magically enchanted items were not mutually exclusive. An item that was empowered could be enchanted, and vise versa."
