        "Powers": {
            "Intelligence": "Every item that was imbued with [[psionic]] power was also instilled with an intelligent personality, capable of communication with any would-be user. This persona was influenced by the feelings and mindset of the psionic crafter, specifically during the time of the item's creation. If the user developed a relationship withe personality within their empowered item, it would typically function with higher efficacy.",
            "Detection": "It was noteworthy that items created via psionic powers could not be detected by [[magic]]al [[divination]]s."
        },
        "Differences from magical enchantment": "Unlike how  a [[mage]] would use specific [[spell]]s from a variety of [[magic|schools of magic]], psionicists could only use powers from a single [[science]] or [[devotion]]. Also, items that were to be empowered would have to be of the highest quality. \n\nDespite the differences in the nature between their respective sources of power, psionically empowered and magically enchanted items were not mutually exclusive. An item that was empowered could be enchanted, and vise versa."
