A '''sabban''' was a major subdivision of a [[Calimshan|Calishite]] town or city, akin to a district or ward.<ref name=EotSS-p99>

==Description==
A sabban was composed of between three and five [[drudach]]s, smaller subdivisions. A sabban was surrounded by a wall that was higher than any drudach walls, being elevated with additional stone to form a rampart.<ref name=EotSS-p99/>

Sabbans contained a minimum of certain structures among their drudachs,<ref name=EotSS-p99/> because each sabban was intended to function as a self-sustaining unit within the larger town or city.<ref name=EotSS-p100>
* At least one of the drudachs must contain a [[khanduq]], in addition to whatever other markets or bazaars existed.<ref name=EotSS-p99/>
* At least one of the drudachs must contain a public source of drinking water, with sufficient supply for all of the sabban's drudachs.<ref name=EotSS-p99/>
* At one of the intersections of the sabban walls, there would be a defensive minaret that also served as an [[Amlakkar#The Amlakkhan|''amlakkhan'']] or [[Sadimmin#Garrisons|''sadiddah'']], a garrisons for that sabban's complement of [[amlakkar]] (police) or [[sadimmin]] (soldiers), respectively. This garrison was in addition to the ''amlakkhan'' belonging to the individual drudachs.<ref name=EotSS-p99/>
* At least one of the drudachs must contain the [[Alzhedo dictionary#S|''sabbaladah'']], the [[Sabban#Government|sabbalad's]] villa or residence. This was often constructed alongside one of the minarets at the intersection of the sabban walls.<ref name=EotSS-p99/>

==Government==
The ruler of a sabban was called a '''sabbalad''' and served much like a mayor&mdash;or in some cases, like a crimelord. A sabbalad was responsible for the drudachs within his sabban, leading through the [[Drudach#Government|druzirs]] positioned under him. If was quite common for the sabbalad to have connections to the criminal underworld as well.<ref name=EotSS-p66>

For particularly small towns or villages, a sabbalad would be the only mayor, as only one sabban&mdash;or perhaps even only one drudach&mdash;was present. In larger towns and cities, the sabbalad was subservient to a [[Alzhedo dictionary#S|sultan]].

Like the druzirs serving under them, the power of a sabbalad had varied depending on the era. They lost much power after the [[Shoon Imperium]] but regained it with the rise to power of [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]].<ref name=EotSS-p66/>

==Defense==
As mentioned above, each sabban had the defenses of each drudach's ''amlakkhan'', plus another ''amlakkhan'' or a ''sadiddah'' dedicated to the defense of the greater sabban. Like the amlakkar, any sadimmin stationed in a sabban were loyal first to the city's sultan(s) and only then to the sabbalad.<ref name=EotSS-p99/>
