        "mainbody": "''cataract''' was a clouding of the lens of the eye.\n\nA cataract caused one's sight to become blurred or softened. For example, the elderly Elizabeth Clawthorn mistook [[lantern]]s as \"golden hands\", while not even seeing the wagons or people that carried them in the evenings. Extreme cases could leave the person partially or fully blinded. The affected eye was described as veiled or clouded, or even appearing dead. It could appear in one or both eyes.\n\nIt appeared most often in the aged, but could also be caused by drinking poor grain alcohol.",
