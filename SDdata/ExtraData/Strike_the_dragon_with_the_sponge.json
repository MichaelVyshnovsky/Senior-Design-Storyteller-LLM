The game was popular in [[the Baths]] of [[Arabel]], where it was often played by groups of [[adventurer]]s or furloughed [[Purple Dragons]], often scantily clad, naked, or wearing only the Baths' customary masks. [[Elminster]] described the game as being similar to the game of [[wikipedia:pin the tail on the donkey|pin the tail on the donkey]] played by the people of [[Earth]].",
