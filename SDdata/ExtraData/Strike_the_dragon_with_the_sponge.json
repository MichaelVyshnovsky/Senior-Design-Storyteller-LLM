The game was popular in the Baths of Arabel, where it was often played by groups of adventurers or furloughed Purple Dragons, often scantily clad, naked, or wearing only the Baths customary masks. Elminster described the game as being similar to the game of pin the tail on the donkey played by the people of Earth.\n* Chase the Dragon\nCategoryGames (in-universe)\njz4vqps2cmihk33g6mrscqio16tz5vj"
