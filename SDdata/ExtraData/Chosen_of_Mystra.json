Due to this blessing they gained access to unprecedented magical power. Mystras Chosen were all concerned with fighting evil and imbalances in the Weave.\n* Alustriel Silverhand\n* Alvaerele Tasundrym\n* Amarune Whitewave\n* Azuth\n* Dove Falconhand\n* Duethaea Lauraunfeir\n* Elminster Aumar\n* Elthaeris\n* Embrae Aloevan of Ardeep\n* Gale Dekarios\n* Jalathleena\n* Kaylaar Allun\n* Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun\n* Laeral Silverhand\n* Nadrathen\n* Qilué Veladorn\n* Sammaster\n* Alassra Shentrantra Silverhand, \"The Simbul\"\n* Syluné Silverhand\n* Symrustar Auglamyr\n* Storm Silverhand\n* Taerele\n* Uirkymbrand\nWhile similar, the Chosen of Mystryl were explicitly distinct and different from Mystras perspective.\n* Araundras Othaun\n* Larloch the Shadow King\nChosen of Mystra gained many benefits from her blessing. They held a greater command over spell, being able to cast even the highest tiers repeatedly.\nThey also became more familiar with magic and able to detect its presence. In addition, many also developed immunities to magic, and eventually even immunities to disease and poison. They become much more hardy, showing a toughness uncharacteristic of most mages.\nMystras Chosen were also immune to the deleterious effects from the casting and wearing of a mantle they suffered no loss of health or the removal of spells from their minds upon the raising of a mantle or the cumulative daily requirement of the spell.\nThe Chosen also wielded silver fire, a unique raw magic that conjured a silvery flame with a variety of functions."
