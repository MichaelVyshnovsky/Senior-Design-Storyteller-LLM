It was believed in Neverwinter that the weeping eye offered protection.\nThe origins of the Neverwinter Eye dated back to the tumultuous year of the , when the Wailing Death plague ravaged the Jewel of the North, immediately followed by the betrayal of the city by its paragon, Aribeth de Tylmarande and a short war with Luskan that shook the citys economy. After the plague and the war ended. The city began to rebuild, and the blue image of a weeping eye, the Eye & Tears started popping up in the city, with the locals believing it to be a symbol of protection. As such, it became a new popular design to be tattooed, especially by sailors and salty dogs of Neverwtiner. One tattooist parlor of note that offered Neverwinter Eye tattoos was Rusty Als Tattoo & Pawn located in the Docks District, one of the places damaged by the plague.\nBy the , the Neverwinter Eye in white on a blue background was adopted by the Neverwinter Nine as part of their uniform. Members of the Nine wore a blue tunic adorned with the sign over their ceremonial armor. The Eye was worn by Sir Nevalle, a trusted aide of Lord Nasher Alagondar, and Darmon, who led the city guard in the late 14 century DR. The weeping eye-decorated uniform was still in use during and several years after the war with the King of Shadows that further damaged Neverwintran economy.\nThe Neverwinter Eye was immortalized as a part of the monument dedicated to Nasher Alagondar that was erected in front of the Neverwinter arena, adorning his belt. The Neverwinter arena was reopened in the late 1490s DR.\nNeverwinter Nine Tunic.png|A member of the Neverwinter Nine in their uniform adorned with the Eye & Tears.\nNevalle.jpg|Nevalle wearing the Neverwinter Eye, a trusted aide to lord Nasher Alagondar.\nDarmons men.jpg|Darmon, another member of the Nine.\nCategoryTattoos\nCategorySymbols\nCategoryArt and literature\nCategoryYear of Metropolises\n4hr4vxz0b1zyxch8idc5c7o7tmr6o5f"
