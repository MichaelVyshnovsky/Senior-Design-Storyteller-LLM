        "Preparation": "A concoction of rare [[herb]]s costing 600 [[dinar]]s was needed to complete scent-related rituals. This ritual took 16 hours to complete.\n\nThis ritual allowed the gen to literally smell the threat of approaching malicious intent so long as it was directed precisely at their sha'ir. The gen was not able to determine the direction or nature of the danger, only that it was present in the general area.\n\nIt should be noted that this ability did nothing to warn of regular dangerous occurences such as falling trees, mudslides, etc.",
