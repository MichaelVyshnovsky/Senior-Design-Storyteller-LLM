        "mainbody": "Delusional Insanity was a form of delusion, mental disorder, or as some called it \"madness\", that was similar to megalomania.\nBeyond natural means, this condition could be acquired by wielding the flail of the desert kings alongside the cursed circlet of the adder or by being hit with the spell mindshatter.\nBeyond life, delusional insanity was among the mental afflictions that could commonly occur among ghasts and ghouls due to the mind-warping nature of their undeath transformation.\nThose suffering from this disorder were convinced that they were a famous, powerful, or wealthy figure. These delusions could be so fantastical that they might even believe themselves to be a deity or demigod. They will act in a manner befitting this misperceived station tend to draw upon things that dont exist and order around other creatures, both real and of their imagination.\nLike any form of madness, it could be suppressed with calm emotions and cured with either greater restoration or lesser restoration.\n* King Khamsa of ancient Raurin was notably afflicted with delusional insanity, due to wielding the circlet of the adder alongside the flail of the desert kings, believing himself to be a deity that rivalled Set."
