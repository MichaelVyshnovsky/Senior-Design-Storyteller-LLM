The '''olanger''' was the traditional ruler of [[Suldolphor]] in far eastern [[Calimshan]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Suldolphor's olanger, who was also referred to as the "Heartflame of Suldolphor," had absolute power within the city and could issue decrees as they saw fit. The olanger's will was enforced by the [[Flame Guard]] who also served as their elite bodyguard.

The olanger was usually selected by [[Waukeen]], but since the goddess' silence following the [[Time of Troubles]], many within Suldolphor were left wondering who would select the next olanger.

==Notable Olangers==
* [[Daeranatha Dorluu]], a high [[priestess]] of [[Waukeen]] who ruled for nearly a century during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
