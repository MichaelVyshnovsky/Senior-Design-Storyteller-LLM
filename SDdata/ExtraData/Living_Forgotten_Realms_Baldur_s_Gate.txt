{{Quote|''A distraught father has gotten no satisfaction from the city authorities of Baldur's Gate, so he turns to sellswords in hopes of finding his lost daughter.

{{Main|Brothers in Arms}}
{{Quote|''A frail alliance connects the city of Baldur's Gate to the nation of Elturgard&mdash;and when vital information crosses the border without authorization, that alliance is bound to be put to the test. A visiting paladin's moral code clashes with the organization that has kept the city safe for more than a century, and the outcome may be hard to predict. A Living Forgotten Realms adventure set in Baldur's Gate for characters levels 4&ndash;7.''}}
