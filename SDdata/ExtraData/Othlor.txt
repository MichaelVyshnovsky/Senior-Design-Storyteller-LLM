An Othlor, or True One, was a title granted to particularly powerful elder Wychlaran in Rashemen.
Othlors were usually served by several Hathrans. Since the Othlors directed the actions of their Hathrans, and the Hathrans in turn advised and controlled Rashemens leaders, the Othlors held a considerable amount of political power within the country. In Rashemen, the sentence for disobeying an Othlor was death. Any sister whose skills merited the title could earn Othlor status, but typically only a dozen or so existed at any one time throughout Rashemen.
