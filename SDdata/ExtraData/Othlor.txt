An '''Othlor''', or '''True One''', was a title granted to particularly powerful elder [[Wychlaran]] in [[Rashemen]].

==History==
Othlors were usually served by several [[Hathran]]s. Since the Othlors directed the actions of their Hathrans, and the Hathrans in turn advised and controlled Rashemen's leaders, the Othlors held a considerable amount of political power within the country. In Rashemen, the sentence for disobeying an Othlor was death. Any sister whose skills merited the title could earn Othlor status, but typically only a dozen or so existed at any one time throughout Rashemen.

==List of Othlors==
* [[Fydra Night-Tree]]
* [[Sheva Whitefeather]]
* [[Zofia]]
