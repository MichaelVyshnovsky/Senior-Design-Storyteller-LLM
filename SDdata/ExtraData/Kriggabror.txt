'''Kriggabror''' (meaing "'''Warrior Brother'''" in [[Giant language|Jotun]]) was a [[firbolg]] clan in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Like many firbolg clans, Kriggabror required its members to carry a written form of "the code" (the guiding principles of the firbolgs) on their person. What made Kriggabror stand out from other clans that required this, was their tradition of having the code engraved upon [[bracer]]s.
