The '''Geildirion of Cimbar''' was a book of secret lore from [[Myth Drannor]].

==History==
The book was held in a tower in Myth Drannor and guarded by a [[beholder mage]] until the party of [[Quenthel Baenre]], with the help of [[Jezz the Lame]], retrieved it in [[1372 DR]] for [[Tzirik]] of [[House Jaelre]] in exchange for more information about the [[Silence of Lolth]].
