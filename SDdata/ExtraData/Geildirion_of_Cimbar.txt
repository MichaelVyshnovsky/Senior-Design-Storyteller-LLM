The Geildirion of Cimbar was a book of secret lore from Myth Drannor.
The book was held in a tower in Myth Drannor and guarded by a beholder mage until the party of Quenthel Baenre, with the help of Jezz the Lame, retrieved it in 1372 DR for Tzirik of House Jaelre in exchange for more information about the Silence of Lolth.
