A '''dagger of defiance''' is a magical [[dagger]], first created in [[Myth Drannor]], that grants the wielder an immunity to fear and repulsion, and enables the wielder to more easily resist the effects of enchantments, charms, polymorphs and petrification.

Such a weapon requires a standard dagger, [[doppelganger blood]], distilled essence of [[xorn]] flesh, and the casting of ''[[fear]]'' and ''[[repulsion]]'' spells.

As of [[1368 DR]], the value of such a dagger was around 1,000 gold pieces. By [[1372 DR]], this was around 12,000 gold pieces.
