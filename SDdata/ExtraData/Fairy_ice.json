        "mainbody": "Fairy ice was a weather phenomenon that was unique to the Great Glacier and the Endless Ice Sea.\nFairy ice was a form of precipitation, made of minuscule granular ice spheres with the consistency of slush. On the ground it resembled regular snow, the only difference was that fairy ice shimmered like a rainbow in sunlight.\nFairy ice settled in depressions in the terrain, and it was common for entire crevasses and valleys to be filled with it. Due to its granular density, fairy ice was similar to quicksand. An individual who stepped onto fairy ice began slowly sinking, but could be pulled out or pull themselves out, otherwise they sank down until completely submerged and began suffocating.\n* The innugaakalikurit village of Gomwemk had a trench surrounding the village that was filled with fairy ice, utilizing it as a defensive measure.\n* The Ice Spires sported fairy ice atop them.\n* The tallest peaks of the Keryjek Ridge glimmered due to fairy ice deposits.\n* The Shakkak Pit in Nakvaligach was filled completely with fairy ice."
