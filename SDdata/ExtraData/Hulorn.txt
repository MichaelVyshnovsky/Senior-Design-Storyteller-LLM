The '''Hulorn''' was the hereditary ruler of [[Selgaunt]].

==History==
The Hulorn was a hereditary title of the merchant-mayor of Selgaunt. Though the Hulorn ruled the city in name, this was more of an honorary position as the real power in Selgaunt lay with the [[Knights of Selgaunt]]. The Hulorn lived within the [[Palace of the Hulorn]] which was attached to the [[Hunting Gardens of the Hulorn|Hunting Gardens]] in the northeast region of the city.

==Notable Hulorns==
