N1 through N4 were not branded with the Forgotten Realms logo, and N1â€“N3 were not set in the Realms. However, the Korinn Archipelago, introduced in module N4 Treasure Hunt, was later officially retconned as being part of the Forgotten Realms setting. N5 Under Illefarn was the first module to actually bear the Forgotten Realms logo. As such, N4 and N5 are the only modules listed below.\nCategoryBooks\n30zdgzd9595yzf230ie4o33hoje3q8f"
