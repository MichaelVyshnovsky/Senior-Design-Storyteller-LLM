N1 through N4 were not branded with the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' logo, and N1â€“N3 were not set in the Realms. However, the [[Korinn Archipelago]], introduced in module N4: ''[[Treasure Hunt]]'', was later officially retconned as being part of the ''Forgotten Realms'' setting. N5: ''[[Under Illefarn]]'' was the first module to actually bear the ''Forgotten Realms'' logo. As such, N4 and N5 are the only modules listed below.",
