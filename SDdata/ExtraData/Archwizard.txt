An archwizard was an arcane spellcaster of extremely high power who successfully claimed a floating enclave.
In order to become an archwizard during the times of Netheril, the arcanist had to
* Create a mythallar
* Carve an enclave from a mountain
* Construct a city on top of the enclave
* Claim the enclave
Some arcanists skipped the first steps and gained archwizard status by taking over the city of a floating enclave. Most arcanists, however, followed the course laid out by their peers, going through all four steps.
Ioulaum of Netheril invented the first mythallar in . He achieved archwizard status when he created the first flying city in Faer√ªn, Xinlenal in . After Xinlenal was afloat, many arcanists of sufficient power strove to make their own floating enclave.
In , the great Karsus was born. 22 years later, he became the youngest archwizard ever known.
