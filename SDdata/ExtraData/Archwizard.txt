An '''archwizard''' was an [[arcane]] [[spellcaster]] of extremely high power who successfully claimed a floating enclave.

==Requirements==
In order to become an archwizard during the times of [[Netheril]], the arcanist had to:
* Create a ''[[mythallar]]''
* Carve an enclave from a mountain
* Construct a city on top of the enclave
* Claim the enclave

Some arcanists skipped the first steps and gained archwizard status by taking over the city of a floating enclave. Most arcanists, however, followed the course laid out by their peers, going through all four steps.

==History==
[[Ioulaum]] of [[Netheril]] invented the first [[mythallar]] in {{YearlinkConvert|845|NY}}. He achieved archwizard status when he created the first flying city in [[Faer√ªn]], [[Xinlenal]] in {{YearlinkConvert|866|NY}}. After Xinlenal was afloat, many arcanists of sufficient power strove to make their own floating enclave.

In {{YearlinkConvert|3163|NY}}, the great [[Karsus]] was born. 22 years later, he became the youngest archwizard ever known.

==Notable Archwizards==
