A '''paramount''' was the ruler of a tribe of [[storm giant]]s.

In most storm giant tribes, the paramount was the most powerful giant and stood atop the [[Ordning (social structure)|''ordning'']]; however, a paramount did not become such by offering a challenge, as in other giant societies. Instead, a paramount was selected after the observing of a sign or omen.

==Notable Paramounts==
* [[Vilmos]], the first storm giant.
* [[Ramos]], the paramount of the [[storm giant aerie of Lake Woe mountain]] in [[1366 DR]].
* [[Anastes]], the paramount of the same giants in [[1369 DR]].
