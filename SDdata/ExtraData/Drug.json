Some physicians were even capable of wielding poisons in a manner that proved beneficial.\nConversely, these same drugs were often used for ill-intent to incapacitate or otherwise gain control over an individual.\nWhile some city-states and nations banned the manufacture and sale of certain illicit drugs, many large cities tolerated their use under certain circumstances, while powerful organizations profited greatly from their distribution.\nIn Waterdeep, making and selling drugs was explicitly banned by Lords edict, punishable by a five-year expulsion and fine of 1,000 gp.\nCertain organizations, such as the Iron Throne, the Cult of the Dragon, and the Zhentarim were known to partially fund their operations through the sale of illegal drugs.\nMind-altering\nDreammist • Sakrash • Travelers dust • Vornduir\nPainkillers\nAlindluth\nStimulants\nHaunspeir • Kammarth • Ziran \nOthers\nChaunsel • Dragonskin • Phantomdust • Tansabra\n*A list of known drugs found in the Realms\ntr4lgam18kg2ztdo27r2fujtbnghrob"
