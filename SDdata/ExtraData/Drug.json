        "Creation": "Closely tied with the disciplines of alchemy and herbology, the manufacture of drugs had long and storied history across [[Faerûn]], tied to many influential clergies of [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian]] faiths.\n\nDue to the fact that the creation of drugs was often a matter of extended experimentation, there were many varieties of drugs known by many names.\n\nCommon reagents used to create drugs included various [[herb]]s, botanical saps, and secretions of various animal species.",
        "Usage": "Many drugs that caused mind-altering effects or prevented users from feeling extreme pain were legally used by [[cleric]]s of various faiths. Some physicians were even capable of wielding [[poison]]s in a manner that proved beneficial.\n\nConversely, these same drugs were often used for ill-intent to incapacitate or otherwise gain control over an individual.",
        "Legality": "While some city-states and nations banned the manufacture and sale of certain illicit drugs, many large cities tolerated their use under certain circumstances, while powerful organizations profited greatly from their distribution.\n\nIn [[Waterdeep]], making and selling drugs was explicitly banned by Lord's edict, punishable by a five-year expulsion and fine of 1,000 [[gp]].\n\nCertain organizations, such as the [[Iron Throne]], the [[Cult of the Dragon]], and the [[Zhentarim]] were known to partially fund their operations through the sale of illegal drugs.",
