==Description==
{{Quote
|You've got the stink of goodness on you. Not as bad a stench as a [[paladin]], but I'm willing to bet you're an honorable guy, a good friend, kind to animals, that sort of nonsense.
|[[Ratagar]]

As with evil, good was subjective and was defined differently by different societies and inhabitants. However, generally, those who were good often worried about their errors and would try to repair damage, if they had caused any. Inhabitants who focused on the pursuit of good, especially helping others, with no particular regard for [[law]] or [[chaos]] were known as [[neutral good]]. Good inhabitants who swore by law and order, particularly paladins, were known as [[lawful good]].

|Working for good and maintaining balance are often matters of small degrees. If you wish to shape a bush you must prune it gently, not take a scythe to it.
|A neutral good sentiment from [[Danilo Thann]] to the Master [[Harper]], [[Bran Skorlsun]].

Some interpreted good inhabitants as those who practiced altruism, protection of life, and personal sacrifice. Others interpreted good people as those who believed that protecting and helping those in need, or those who are too weak to act for themselves, was the right thing to do.
