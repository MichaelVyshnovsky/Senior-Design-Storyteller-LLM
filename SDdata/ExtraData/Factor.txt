A '''factor''' was a traveling trade agent working for a third party.

==Background==
A factor was employed as a salesman, paymaster, and buyer tasked with dealing mercantile business for someone else. Factors had to travel across the Realms to create new trade deals. If they came from a rural area, they usually were hired from afar, and might be employed by many people.

A few factors rose to become kingpins, hiring other factors to work for them.

==History==
In the 13{{Th}} century [[DR]], factors didn't exist as an actual profession. The few individuals who identified as such usually worked for nobles, royal households, or courts.

In [[1270 DR]], factors became professionals hired by merchants or other parties, increasing in importance and influence in the following decades. Thanks to the rise of factors as important trade dealers, [[adventurer|adventuring]] also became an actual profession, as factors usually hired adventurers to serve as bodyguards and agents.

==Notable Factors==
* [[Sammereza Sulphontis]] of [[Waterdeep]]
* [[Mirt]] the [[Moneylending|Moneylender]]
