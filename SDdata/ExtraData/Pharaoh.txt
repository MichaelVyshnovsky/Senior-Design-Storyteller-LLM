[[File:Pharaoh.png|thumb|right|300px|''A pharaoh of [[Mulhorand]].'']]
"'''Pharaoh'''" was the term used for the ultimate ruler of the empire of [[Mulhorand]]. The title was also used in the land of [[Raurin]] for the leaders of [[Bakar]].

==Divinity==
Up until the [[Time of Troubles]], the pharaohs of Mulhorand were physical incarnations of [[Horus-Re]], the solar [[deity]] who bore the title of "Pharaoh of the Gods".  The pharaoh's family members were also considered incarnations, though of the other deities of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]]. The exception to this was the firstborn son. They would also be an incarnation of Horus-Re, such that the title of pharaoh could be passed down to him.

==Requirements==
All of Mulhorand's pharaohs were required to be male. They were also expected to be members of the [[House of Helcaliant]], the priestly House of Horus-Re, and thus descendants of an incarnation of the god.

==Responsibilities==

The pharaoh of Mulhorand ruled from his throne in the city of [[Skuld]]. While the most powerful individual in Mulhorand in name, most pharaohs allowed the [[priest]]s to determine most of its policies, The official second-in-command under the pharaoh was the vizier, who was the highest-ranking cleric in the Church of Horus-Re.

When a new pharaoh took the throne, typically, a census would be his first act.

==Burial==
In both the nations of Bakar and Mulhorand, pharaohs were buried in elaborate tombs.

In Mulhorand, a pharaoh's family was traditionally buried with them and their tombs were situated in the [[Land of the Dead]], part of the valley [[Great Vale|Asanibis]] on the edge of the [[Dragonsword Mountains]],

==History==
Long after the kingdom of Bakar had fallen to ruin, legends of its pharaohs still circulated in the Raurin Desert. According to some, the pharaohs of Bakar were evil, while others claimed they were largely benevolent rulers.

The only pharaohs in the history of Mulhorand who were not an incarnation of Horus-Re were two incarnations of [[Thoth]] who ruled for a short time after the loss of [[Thay]]. This period of Mulhorand's history lasted from [[922 DR]] to [[955 DR]].

Following the Time of Troubles, the [[overgod]] [[Ao]] finally dispersed the [[Imaskari Empire|Imaskari]] planar barrier that separated the Mulhorandi gods' [[avatar|manifestation]]s from their divine essences in the [[Outer Planes]].<ref> As a result of their reunion, the then-pharaoh [[Horustep III]] and all his family members lost the fragments of divinity that were previously within them, reducing them to mere mortals with divine lineage.
