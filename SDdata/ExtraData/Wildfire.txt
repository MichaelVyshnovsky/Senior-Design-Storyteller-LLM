'''Wildfire''' was a peculiar [[wild magic]] phenomenon observed in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]] in which an individual suddenly displayed the ability to use [[magic]] when placed in dangerous situations, albeit uncontrolled and in a chaotic fashion.

==Description==
It manifested only once or twice a year in a small portion of the residents, known as wildfire-wielders. People who exhibited signs of wildfire were always native residents of Ravens Bluff who had no formal training in the arcane arts. The warlord [[Myrkyssa Jelan]] discovered the reason for this: a wild [[mythal]], built by the [[dark elf|dark elves]] below the city. The mythal's magic seeped into the air, earth, and water surrounding Ravens Bluff, and was the source of wildfire.

==History==
In the 1370s DR, Myrkyssa sought multiple times to conquer or seize control of the city of Ravens Bluff and thus exploit the wild mythal to aid her future conquests.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|137}}

Unfortunately for Jack, the [[House of High Magic]], a local [[mage]] guild, [[divination|divined]] that Jack's wildfire would bring some sort of magical calamity (possibly the [[Spellplague]]) to Ravens Bluff so they imprisoned Jack in magical stasis inside the mythal stone. He didn't escape until over a hundred years had passed.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|3122|9}}

The destruction of the wild mythal in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, resulted in Jack losing his magical abilities.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|4960|13}}
