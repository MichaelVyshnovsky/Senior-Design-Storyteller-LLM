Dominated by deserts as the Land of Fate was, the magical province took its name from the one place where water was abundant the seas surrounding the continent, so important for trade and travel. Many of its spells were related to sea-faring.\nThe four elemental provinces played a very similar role for Zakharan magic-users as the eight (or nine) schools of magic did for Faer√ªnian ones.\nZakharan sages speculated that the province of sea was developed in the Corsair Domains.\nElemental mages in Zakhara specialized exclusively in one province, like sea, while sorcerers took spells from two provinces, shunning the other two. Unlike elementalists, magic-users from the Land of Fate recognized no opposition between sea and flame.\nZakharan practicioners of path magic recognized four paths of power within the province of seaPaths to power are an alternative system of rules for the spell progression and learning of spells by wizards for 2nd edition Dungeons & Dragons. They could therefore be considered non-canon.\n*Sea Childrens Road, manipulating water to ease travel and life in general\n*Corsairs Path, containing spells affecting ships and sea travel\n*Mistweavers Path, using fog, water and ice to distract and attack\n*Road of the Marid, comprising spells to protect one against the elements and affect elemental water creatures\n*Spells in the province of sea\n__NOTOC__\nCategorySchools of magic\nCategorySchools of effect\nCategoryMagic\n9sqvtxdqa8k4ucjxzskou06ghl48ljr"
