Dominated by deserts as the Land of Fate was, the magical province took its name from the one place where water was abundant: the seas surrounding the continent, so important for trade and travel.<ref><ref> Many of its spells were related to sea-faring.<ref>\n\nThe four elemental provinces played a very similar role for Zakharan magic-users as the eight (or nine) [[schools of magic]] did for [[Faer√ªn]]ian ones.",
        "History": "Zakharan sages speculated that the province of sea was developed in the [[Corsair Domains]].",
