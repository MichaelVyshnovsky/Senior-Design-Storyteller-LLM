I dont see anywhere to leave notes on or in the map, so Ill put them here.
This map was put together using multiple sources. The three main sources were the three instances in which this specific map by Mike Schley was used in a sourcebook or adventure
* Neverwinter Campaign Setting (p. 11)
* Lost Mine of Phandelver (p. 5)
* Dragon of Icespire Peak (p. 5)
The following locations were added according to their locations on the Neverwinter map
* Broken Crown Inn
* Cragmire Keep
* Ebon Downs
* Pirates Skyhold (location was moved closer to Neverwinter per Neverwinter Campaign Setting p. 139)
* Roth√© Valley Village
* Vellosk
The following locations were added according to their locations on maps from other sources
* Gauntlgrym, based on another map by Mike Schley (from Storm Kings Thunder, p. 74)
* Silent Sound Lighthouse, from a more stylized map in Orrery of the Wanderer in Acquisitions Incorporated (p. 81)
The following locations were added based on in-text descriptions
* Wayside Inn, based on the following description in Storm Lords Wrath "an inn where the Triboar Trail meets the High Road"
Ill update this note if I add more locations. -Arodp88 (talk) 1518, 18 April 2022 (UTC)
