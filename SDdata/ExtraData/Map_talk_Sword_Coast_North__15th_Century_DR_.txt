==Map Notes==
I don't see anywhere to leave notes on or in the map, so I'll put them here.

This map was put together using multiple sources. The three main sources were the three instances in which this specific map by [[Mike Schley]] was used in a sourcebook or adventure:
* ''[[Neverwinter Campaign Setting]]'' (p. 11)
* ''[[Lost Mine of Phandelver]]'' (p. 5)
* ''[[Dragon of Icespire Peak]]'' (p. 5)

The following locations were added according to their locations on the ''[[Neverwinter]]'' map:
* [[Broken Crown Inn]]
* [[Cragmire Keep]]
* [[Ebon Downs]]
* [[Pirates' Skyhold]] (location was moved closer to Neverwinter per ''[[Neverwinter Campaign Setting]]'' p. 139)
* [[Roth√© Valley Village]]
* [[Vellosk]]

The following locations were added according to their locations on maps from other sources:
* [[Gauntlgrym]], based on another map by Mike Schley (from ''[[Storm King's Thunder]]'', p. 74)
* [[Silent Sound Lighthouse]], from a more stylized map in ''[[Orrery of the Wanderer]]'' in ''[[Acquisitions Incorporated (sourcebook)|Acquisitions Incorporated]]'' (p. 81)

The following locations were added based on in-text descriptions:
* [[Wayside Inn]], based on the following description in ''[[Storm Lord's Wrath]]'': "an inn where the Triboar Trail meets the High Road"

I'll update this note if I add more locations. -[[User:Arodp88|Arodp88]] ([[User talk:Arodp88|talk]]) 15:18, 18 April 2022 (UTC)
