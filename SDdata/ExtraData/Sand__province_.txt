{{Otheruses4|the province of magic|the character|Sand}}
The '''province of sand''' in the [[Zakhara]]n view of [[magic]] was a group of spells related to the [[Earth (element)|element of earth]], taking its name from one of its most common forms in the desert lands of the Land of Fate.<ref><ref> Many of its spells contained and used [[sand]] as an essential part.<ref><ref>

The four elemental provinces played a very similar role for Zakharan magic-users as the eight (or nine) [[schools of magic]] did for [[Faer√ªn]]ian ones.

==History==
Zakharan sages speculated that many of the spells from the province of sand were invented by the [[Geomancer]]s of ancient [[Kadar]].

==Users==
[[Elemental mage]]s in Zakhara specialized exclusively in one province, like sand, while [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]] took spells from two provinces, shunning the other two. Unlike [[elementalist]]s,<ref> they recognized no opposition between sand and the other three elements in the Land of Fate.

==Paths of power==
Zakharan practicioners of [[path magic]] recognized four paths of power within the province of sand:{{Cite dragon/216/Paths of Power}}<ref group="note">Paths to power are an alternative system of rules for the spell progression and learning of spells by [[wizards]] for [[2nd edition]] [[Dungeons & Dragons]]. They could therefore be considered non-canon.
*Road of Shifting Sands, mainly concerned with moving and shaping sand
*Glassblower's Path, manipulating and transforming sand
*[[Sandman]]'s Path, inducing sleep and easing travel
*Road of the [[Dao]], comprising spells to protect one against the elements and affect elemental sand/earth creatures
