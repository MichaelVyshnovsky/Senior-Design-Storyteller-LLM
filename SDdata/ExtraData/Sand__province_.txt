The province of sand in the Zakharan view of magic was a group of spells related to the element of earth, taking its name from one of its most common forms in the desert lands of the Land of Fate. Many of its spells contained and used sand as an essential part.
The four elemental provinces played a very similar role for Zakharan magic-users as the eight (or nine) schools of magic did for Faer√ªnian ones.
Zakharan sages speculated that many of the spells from the province of sand were invented by the Geomancers of ancient Kadar.
Elemental mages in Zakhara specialized exclusively in one province, like sand, while sorcerers took spells from two provinces, shunning the other two. Unlike elementalists, they recognized no opposition between sand and the other three elements in the Land of Fate.
Zakharan practicioners of path magic recognized four paths of power within the province of sandPaths to power are an alternative system of rules for the spell progression and learning of spells by wizards for 2nd edition Dungeons & Dragons. They could therefore be considered non-canon.
*Road of Shifting Sands, mainly concerned with moving and shaping sand
*Glassblowers Path, manipulating and transforming sand
*Sandmans Path, inducing sleep and easing travel
*Road of the Dao, comprising spells to protect one against the elements and affect elemental sand/earth creatures
*Spells in the province of sand
