The '''aearee''' were the avian [[creator race]] of [[Faerûn]]. The aearee prospered during the [[Days of Thunder]].

==History==
They originally inhabited the [[Aearee Enclaves]] on a massive island in the [[Silver Sea]], around {{Yearlink|-31500}}. This island existed off the coast of [[Merrouroboros]], pre-[[Tearfall|Sundering]].

They rose to prominence ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-31000}}, around the time of the [[Tearfall]]. They established the [[Aearee Empires]] across Faerûn, and built a few grand aeries. The [[Aearee-Krocaa]] founded [[Viakoo]] on [[Mount Havraquoar]] in the west, the [[Aearee-Syran]] founded [[Phwiukree]] in the [[Star Mounts]] in the north, and the [[Aearee-Quor]] founded [[Shara]] in the [[Orsraun Mountains]]. The rise of these empires (along with those of the [[batrachi]]) prevented the [[yuan-ti]] from fully claiming the power the [[sarrukh]] empires held before their fall.<ref>

Around {{Yearlink|-30700}}, a number of [[lammasu]] defeated a much larger force of [[Aearee-Krocaa]], killing one thousand. The aearee later experimented on domesticated [[landwyrm]]s to create winged wyrms, or [[wyvern]]s. Supported by wyvern forces, the Aearee-Krocaa empire commenced a rapid expansion.

The aearee of the [[Kookrui-Shara]] rookery fell into conflict with the [[gnoll]]s of [[Urgnarash]] {{Yearlink|-30400}}. Gnoll shamans, following [[Yeenoghu]], summoned [[marrash]] to spread disease among the aearee. Aearee crops were blighted, and the aearee suffered the [[Wasting Plague]]. The Aearee-Quor were decimated, and many of them began worshiping the [[demon]] lord [[Pazuzu|Pazrael]] to seek salvation.

The aearee were the last of the creator races to take control of the [[Ba’etith]], an organization that was created in the [[Isstosseffifil]] Empire of the [[sarrukh]] to study the magics of the races native to Faerûn. It was primarily based out of the [[Hall of Mists]], which was located in the [[High Forest]], very near Phwiukree. The studies of this group were eventually codified into the [[Nether Scrolls]], which contained the fundamentals theories of magic and became the basis of nearly all magical teaching in the world.<ref>

Finally, around {{Yearlink|-30000}}, [[dragon]]s all over [[Faerûn]] gathered in the first [[Flight of Dragons]] to assault the aearee in the sky, on land, and underground. The Aearee Empires fell, as [[Viakoo]] was burned from the air and [[Shara]] was conquered by the dragon-general [[Nagamat]].

===Legacy===
Many thousands of years later, Captain [[Eartharran Neirdre]] of [[Evermeet]] sought a lost city of the creator races and discovered a floating city off the northern coast of Anchorome. It contained statues of the inhabitants, and Eartharran named the race "aearee". However, dragons assaulted and destroyed Eartharran's flying ship, which crashed on an island north of where [[Fort Flame]] later stood.

In the mid–14th century DR, the question of whether dragons or some avian race were one of the creator races was a long-running debate among scholars. Loremaster [[Ignace Dethingeller]] discovered the remains of Eartharran's ship and journal, and communicating his discovery of the aearee city to First Reader [[Tethtoril]] of [[Candlekeep]] in the late 14th century.

The aearee created or were the ancestors of the following races and creatures:
* [[Wyvern]]<nowiki/>s
* [[Aarakocra]]
* [[Kenku]]
* [[Owlbear]]<ref group="note">Given the owl part of the owlbear, it stands to reason that the avian creator race was responsible, as all known creations of the creator races have shared biological characteristics.
* Other unnamed avian races

==Nations==
The three Aearee Empires established their capitals in the following locales:
* [[Aearee-Krocaa]]: The grand aerie of [[Viakoo]] on [[Mount Havraquoar]]
* [[Aearee-Syran]]: The aerie of [[Phwiukree]] in the [[Star Mounts]]
* [[Aearee-Quor]]: The rookery of [[Shara]] in the [[Orsraun Mountains]]

==Description==
According to Captain Eartharran Neirdre's sketches of statues found in a reputedly aearee city, the aearee were a humanoid race with both avian and draconic features, including both feathers and scales. Eartharran wondered if they were descendants of dragons who'd evolved bird-like features, or an ancestor of both avian and draconic creatures.
