The '''Master of Drains and Underways''' was an officer position within the government of [[Baldur's Gate]]. They oversaw all the maintenance and construction of all the sewer systems, water pumps, pipes, cellars, and other channels that allowed water to flow to every corner of the city.

The office required great technical understanding that was beyond most bureaucrats and [[patriar]]. However, anyone knowledgeable enough to hold the title was required to do little actual work beyond managing their subordinates. As such it was both a highly desirable, yet rarely sought after role.
