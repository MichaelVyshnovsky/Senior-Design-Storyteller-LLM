It also required that an assortment of metal objects&mdashoften old armor or broken weapons&mdashbe hung from the ceiling over the throwing area.\nWhile its rules differed depending on where it was played, a common variation had the following rules. A blindfolded woman would hold two daggers, and players would bet on whether one, both, or none of the daggers would land in the sand blade down after thrown. After bets were placed, the woman would toss the daggers into the air simultaneously and step quickly back out of harms way. A valid toss must involve each dagger striking at least one of the hanging metal items.\nThe game was played until no one else could place any more bets or after an agreed upon series of six, seven, nine, or twelve bets.\nThis game was especially popular in Cormyr at the Lucky Dragon gambling house in Jesters Green.\nCategorySports\n4kl0365rhwgdowi50aq6zmj6k9ll14y"
