The '''red leafhopper''' was a type of [[insect]] found in [[Faer√ªn]], such as in the [[rimwood]] area of the forest of [[Cormanthor]].

[[Lyra Sunrose]] once rode through the rimwood of Cormanthor and found what she thought was an [[apple]] tree, but which turned out to be a [[pine]] with clusters of red leafhopper larvae hanging from its branches.<ref>
