The red leafhopper was a type of insect found in Faer√ªn, such as in the rimwood area of the forest of Cormanthor.
Lyra Sunrose once rode through the rimwood of Cormanthor and found what she thought was an apple tree, but which turned out to be a pine with clusters of red leafhopper larvae hanging from its branches.
