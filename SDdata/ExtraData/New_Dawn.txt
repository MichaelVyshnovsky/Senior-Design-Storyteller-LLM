New Dawn was the name chosen for a proposed village, farming community, and temple of Lathander in the Hindhorn Hills, northwest of Secomber in the early 1370s DR.
Due to the roaming wolves, gnolls, and orcs in the area, an offer of two dragons per day was made for anyone defending the project when it began. Its spokesperson was Harammas Malark.
