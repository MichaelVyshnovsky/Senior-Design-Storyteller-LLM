        "mainbody": "corns of desire were magical acorns that the goddess Shiallia occasionally gifted to her favored worshipers, usually doing so by having them fall from the sky and land in front of the feet of her desired recipient.\nThese acorns would only function for those they were originally gifted to. When held in a closed fist and concentrated upon, any request made by the receipient would be fulfilled as close as possible to their desires. This effect was usually within the limits of a limited wish spell, though occasionally Shiallia gifted acorns of desire that carried the power of a full wish. Once this wish was granted, the acorn would disappear, leaving behind a permanent, golden-hued tattoo in the shape of an acorn upon the users palm."
