The '''Final Pact of Apoapsis''' was a part of the compact that [[Carnis|the Traitor]] had with the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. Upon his death, the aboleths would be granted access to the [[Prime Material Plane]] of [[Toril]];{{cite book/Stardeep|293|28}} this forced the [[Keepers of the Cerulean Sign]] to hold the Traitor alive in [[Stardeep]] instead of simply slaying him.{{cite book/Stardeep|65|6}}

One of the [[Well-born avatar]]s attempted to call upon a final pact prior to the [[Stardeep#Telarian Incident|Telarian Incident]] of {{yearlink|1375}}, possibly this one as well.{{cite book/Stardeep|153|13}}
