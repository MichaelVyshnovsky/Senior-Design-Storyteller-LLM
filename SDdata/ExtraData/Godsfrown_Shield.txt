A '''Godsfrown Shield''' was a form of financial transaction that required payment in exchange for a future payment were some other condition to come to pass.

==Use==
The purchase of a Godsfrown Shield required the purchaser to make recurring payments to the seller. The shield was for a given physical thing, such as a house, ship, or cargo. Were it to be stolen, destroyed, or otherwise come to misfortune within the agreed terms, then the seller would instead pay out a drastically larger sum than the recurring payments, thus becoming the "Godsfrown Shield". Sellers of Godsfrown Shields were expected to make arrangements to prevent misfortune from coming to happen on the matters on which the Godsfrown Shield was purchased.

In short, according to sages of the Realms, it was a form of [[insurance]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-08-11 - Godsfrown Shields}}

==History==
[[Andemel Graeven]] purchased a Godsfrown Shield from [[Baerusin]] at some point prior to [[Ches 14]] of the {{yearlinkName|1356}}, securing his shop. Given [[Raurild Sarpath]]'s comments on him having survived the fire, and his own later comments about there being a fire in his shop one hour from then, it was strongly implied he was going to commit insurance fraud.
