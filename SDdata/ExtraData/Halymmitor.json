        "mainbody": "Halymmitor''' was a homesteading clan to the west of the [[Lake of Snows]] in the early 12{{th}} century [[DR]]. [[Olohmber Starnardyn]] took an interest in this clan during his tenure as the [[Magister]], noting that some of their members had [[psionic]] [[wild talent]]s and that their ancestors were mages. He meant to find out if their descendants would have stronger and more reliable psionic talent; after some time playing matchmaker with subtle spells, the Magister became convinced that talent for magic was inheritable for those families.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|64}}The source makes references to both sorcery and psionic talent, but mentions conclusions for sorcery only."
