A '''supernatural gift''' was a [[magic]]al and intangible enhancement or power bestowed on mortals by powerful entities often as a reward for their services or deeds. When given by a [[deity]] or other godlike being, such a gift was often called a '''blessing''' and could confer permanent benefits to the recipient. Lesser gifts were often known as '''charms''', and were more limited or temporary but could come from many sources. Sinister gifts from powerful [[demon]]s or [[devil]]s were sometimes known as '''boons''', and were used to empower their mortal cultists.

==Blessings==
Only when a mortal's deeds warranted the attention of the gods could they hope to receive a divine blessing. In the rare cases when a blessing was gifted, it was often to reward something like restoring a god's most sacred shrine, ending an earthshaking plot by a god's enemies, aiding a god's favored servant in a divine quest, or embarking on a quest of a great urgency to a god. their [[priest]]s, their [[Chosen]], or a recipients of their prior blessings.{{Cite adventurers league/Hecatomb|26}}

Gods always bestowed blessings that granted powers or capabilities useful to the recipient, and the most common blessings tended to provide abilities or enhancements similar to [[magic item]]s. These powers could not be suppressed by any normal means (e.g., with an ''[[antimagic field]]'' or similar power), and a god's blessing could not be lost unless the same god chose to revoke it. This might happen if the recipient lost the god's favor or if their actions failed to advance some purpose that the god had intended for them to achieve.

[[Elder evil]]s were also said to grant warped blessings, although these were usually channeled and bestowed by their cultists who discovered them only after many years of trial and error. While such blessings were often rewards for service to a cult, they might also be given to those who had lapsed or failed in their cult duties in order to provide them power needed for a chance at redemption.

==Other Supernatural Gifts==
===Dark Gifts===
'''Dark gifts''' were similar to charms, but were conferred by dark gods and sinister forces within the [[Domains of Dread]], potentially even the [[Dark Powers]] themselves. Such dark gifts often entailed insidious influence over the recipient by the giver, and might just as often seem to arise from a [[curse]] as from a bargain or reward.

===Demonic Boons===
'''Demonic boons''' were [[evil]] powers bestowed by demons that inevitably corrupted and damned the [[soul]] of any who received one, driving them to madness. Any demon was able to grant a limited number of boons to mortals seeking their power, with more powerful demons able to grant more boons and [[demon lord]]s able to grant an unlimited number, which they used to gather and empower cults. Such boons were as fickle as the demons themselves, however, and their benefits would fade as soon as the bestowing demon became displeased. If a demon offered a boon and was refused, it was a terrible insult.

===Diabolic Boons===
The gifts and boons offered by archdevils were often intended to tempt susceptible mortals into serving them and to empower their followers. This included delegating the power to offer '''archdevil charms''' to their servants, who used them to sweeten the offers of infernal contracts. The types of gifts they could bestow were ultimately determined by [[Asmodeus]].

===Draconic Gifts===
It was said that upon the death of a dragon, its power could take root in a mortal—whether that dragon's ally or its slayer—and manifest as a '''draconic gift'''. These gifts were said to vary widely in power and usefulness, and to be often accompanied by minor physical changes to the recipient's body.

===Feywild Gifts===
[[Fey]] were said to be able to confer gifts or minor blessings that could permanently alter a mortal's physical appearance, including causing them to sprout antlers and flowers, making them smell of fresh [[spice]]s and [[herb]]s, or surrounding them with [[illusory]] butterflies or dancing shadows.

==History==
The spirits of deceased [[Uthgardt]] chieftains would grant useful charms to those who returned stolen treasures to their barrows.

Sometime prior to the {{YearlinkName|-343}}, the arcanists of the [[Netherese enclave]] of Ythryn devised a [[magic goblet]] that bestowed special charms with secondary effects that triggered when the charms expired. They also cultivated special [[purple pear]]s, eating which could confer charms that granted the ability to cast spells (including ''[[cure wounds]]'', ''[[druidcraft]]'', ''faerie fire'', ''greater restoration'', ''[[invisibility]]'', ''lesser restoration'', ''lightning bolt'', ''[[sending]]'', and ''[[vicious mockery]]'').

When the lich Acererak constructed the [[Tomb of the Nine Gods]]—a death trap intended to lure and kill adventurers—in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], he included means for explorers to gain useful charms meant to encourage risky behavior in the [[dungeon]].

At some point in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the spymaster known as [[SEER]] received a ''blessing of protection'' from Savras, and claimed to confer with him when she believed that others were worthy of the same honor.

As of {{Yearlink|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} Jeryth Phaulkon was known to bestow ''charms of restoration'' to welcome new members into the [[Emerald Enclave]] in [[Waterdeep]], as well as to award ''charms of heroism'' to those who achieved great deeds for the faction.

[[Szass Tam]] was said to offer charms as part of deals or bargains if he found himself in negotiations.
