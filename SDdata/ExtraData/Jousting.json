Many believed jousting simply involved repeating this process until either one of the competitors yielded or were unseated from their saddle by the force and momentum of the opposing lance. However, there was a wide variety of terminology, strategy, and scoring involved with the sport.\nTraditionally, a match was won once a competitor earned three points—unseating an opponent provided exactly this amount, thus why many boiled the sport down to this being the objective. Additionally, two points could be earned by striking an opponents helmet and a single point could be earned by breaking the opposing lance. If a lance was lost, some jousts had competitors switch to a blunted longsword. If a tie were to occur, competitors would continue jousting until one of them had surpassed the other in points.\nWithin the jousting scene it was common to refer to strikes by which area of an opponent’s shield they were aimed towards. Striking towards Pale Chief, Pale Fess, or the opponents helm were considered aggressive strikes that limited posture and seating position, leaving one vulnerable to strikes. All other strikes were considered defensive and allowed for changing ones posture with ease.\nEquipment included jousting lances, which were lances specially designed to lessen injuries, Individual knights were often identified by colorful patterned dress, heraldry, or banners, as well as matching caparisons for their mount.\nAlternatively, if a jousting lance was too expensive for a rider to acquire they might opt for a lance cup, which were blunted caps of wood fitted over lances to make them suitable for tournament use. However, lance cups were notoriously undependable, having a chance to detach and fall off the lance they were on. Whenever this occurred a jousts officials would interrupt, having contestants start over, and if this were to repeatedly occur it could garner the risk of disqualification.\nJousting was a common sport all over Faerûn, with some noted areas of practice including the Border Kingdoms, Tethyr, the Dalelands, Sespech, Waterdeep,\nIn Sespech, the three-day festival known as the Feast of Purple Majesty held jousting matches on its first day, the Dawn of Equines.\nIn Cormyr and Sembia, jousting competitions were a traditional feature of the festival of Fists. Within the kingdom of Cormyr, the first three points of any jousting match were denoted by flags depicting the Cormyrean seal, with a fourth flag reserved for only the winner of a tie-breaker. Cormyrean tournaments also had jousting manuals for sale at stalls and certain color schemes reserved for Cormyrean noble houses.\nIn Chult, Fort Beluarian held monthly jousting tournaments.\nOutside the walls of Ravens Bluff, annual jousting events were held by Chauntean clerics on Tarsakh 4 as part of the celebration known as the Arming. The city was also host to jousting contests during its Town Fair.\nIn the city of Waterdeep, horseback and griffon-back jousts were held in the Field of Triumph.\nThe lesser sanctuary of the Silver Halls, a Tyrran temple, had tapestries depicting scenes of conflict and jousting. And the Tyyran order Knights of Samular regularly practiced the art of jousting at Summit Hall.\nBeyond Faerûn, in the Endless Wastes, Hubadai Khahan and his traveling court Queraband held jousting matches at their annual spring festivals in the Valley of the God.\nBeyond the Prime Material, the marids of the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls often held jousting matches.\nJousting had a long history in the Realms, being considered an ancient tradition in Cormyr, among other places. The sport initially began as a sort of contest by which knights could prove their prowess to either their peers or their king. Over time the sport became more formal and the right to hold a tournament was seen as a sign of influence. By the late 14 century DR, the sport was quite popularly viewed as a means by which people could garner for themselves fame, influence, or even power.\n*Drakkar Von Damm, the winner of the jousting competition during the Founders Day Celebration of 1368 DR in Ravens Bluff."
