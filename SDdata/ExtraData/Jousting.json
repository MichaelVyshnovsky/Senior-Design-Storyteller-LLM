Striking towards Pale Chief, Pale Fess, or the opponent's helm were considered aggressive strikes that limited posture and seating position, leaving one vulnerable to strikes. All other strikes were considered defensive and allowed for changing one's posture with ease.\n\n===Equipment===\nEquipment included [[Lance#Varieties_of_Lances|jousting lances]], which were lances specially designed to lessen injuries, Individual knights were often identified by colorful patterned dress, heraldry, or banners, as well as matching [[caparison]]s for their mount.\n\nAlternatively, if a jousting lance was too expensive for a rider to acquire they might opt for a '''lance cup''', which were blunted caps of wood fitted over lances to make them suitable for tournament use.

        "History": "Jousting had a long history in the Realms, being considered an ancient tradition in Cormyr, among other places. The sport initially began as a sort of contest by which knights could prove their prowess to either their peers or their king. Over time the sport became more formal and the right to hold a tournament was seen as a sign of influence. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the sport was quite popularly viewed as a means by which people could garner for themselves fame, influence, or even power.",
