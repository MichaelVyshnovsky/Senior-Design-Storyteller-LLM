The '''Tsu family''' was a declining noble house related to the [[Igi clan]] in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

They still controlled the [[kokushu]] position but little more than that. In the past, the Igi were considered vassals of the Tsu but around 1357 DR, the Igi dominated the Tsu.
