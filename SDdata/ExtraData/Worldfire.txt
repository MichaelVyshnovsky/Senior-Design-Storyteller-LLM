'''Worldfire''' was an extremely dangerous [[magic]]al ability that allowed a [[spellcaster]] to drain energy from another [[Prime Material Plane|world]] or [[plane]] to empower its spellcasting abilities.{{Cite dragon/427/The Sundering: To Rule Two Worlds|36}} Using this ability not only drained the life force of a world or plane, it also damaged the [[Weave]].{{Cite dragon/427/The Sundering: To Rule Two Worlds|37}}

==Background==
According to [[Elminster Aumar]], worldfire was a flashy name for this ability because, unlike other magical abilities such as the [[spellfire]], there were no fire or energy emanations of any kind when someone used the worldfire. This was because using worldfire was so dangerous that spellcasters had to firmly control the raw energy summoned from other planes, not only to protect themselves but also to conceal that they were using this ability. However, in some rare instances [[fire]]-based [[spell]]s were empowered if they were used alongside worldfire.{{Cite dragon/427/The Sundering: To Rule Two Worlds|38}}

==History==
In the late [[1480 DR|1480s DR]], [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] had forbidden her [[Chosen of Mystra|Chosen]] and her other followers to deal with worldfire users, as those individuals were capable of use their ability to drain [[silver fire]], and this could severely damage not only the worlds of [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]], but also the Weave itself. However, Mystra compelled all magical-gifted beings, such as mortals capable of use magic or [[dragon]]s, among others, to openly oppose the use of worldfire.

According to Elminster, a few spellcasters from both Abeir and Toril, became interested in worldfire after the [[Second Sundering]], and they were trying to use worldfire to increase their own powers, regardless of the damage caused to either world. Among [[Faer√ªn]]ian spellcasters, the most notorious users of worldfire were the [[wizard]] [[Leoanos Roroebryn]], the [[zulkir]] [[Talaskos Murthrond]], and the [[Rashemi]] [[witch]] [[Velvroame]].
