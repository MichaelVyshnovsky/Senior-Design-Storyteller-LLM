'''Zoology''' was the field of study of animals and monsters. 

==Knowledge==
A zoology sage could generally identify common species within the class of animals they specialized in, as well as predict the behavior and capabilities of said creatures.

==Sub-Fields==
Sages in this field often specialized in certain general classes of animals. These included amorphous monsters (such as [[slime]]s and [[jelly|jellies]]), amphibians, aquatic monsters, [[bird]]s, [[fish]], hybrid monsters (such as [[griffon]]s or [[peryton]]s), mundane insects, insectoid monsters, mundane mammals, mammalian monsters, mundane [[reptile]]s, and reptilian monsters.
* '''Entomology:''' the study of arachnids and insects, both mundane and giant.{{Cite dragon/191/Unearthed Mundana|98}}
* '''Herpetology:''' the study of amphibians and/or reptiles.
* '''Ichthyology:''' the study of fish and fish-like creatures.{{Cite dragon/191/Unearthed Mundana|99}}
* '''Ornithology:''' the study of birds and bird-like creatures.
* Some sages studied a class of monsters that was known as "aberrant zoology". These sages focused their efforts on capturing, documenting, and explaining [[aberration]]s.

==Education==
[[Scroll]]s were often used by zoologists to collect, preserve, and communicate the knowledge they obtained to other zoologists and lay persons. This knowledge typically regarded the anatomy, diet, and behaviors of an animal.{{Cite dragon/191/Unearthed Mundana|100}}

The value of these scrolls varied depending upon the animal discussed and a buyer's profession, though almost all types were of interest to sages. They were often of interest to professions that handled animals, such as farmers, furriers, hunters, ranchers, shepherds, and swineherds. Entomology scrolls were often valued by beekeepers, [[druid]]s, and farmers. Herpetology scrolls were often valued by hunters and druids that dwelled in marshes, jungles, or swamps. Ornithological scrolls were often valued by artists, bird-watchers, falconers, fletchers, and fowlers. And finally, ichthyological scrolls were often valued by fishermen as well as druids that dwelled along the coast or shore.

Besides scrolls, some wrote [[book]]s regarding their findings, such as [[Volo's Guide to Monsters (in-universe)|''Volo's Guide to Monsters'']], ''[[Tym's Monstrous Book]]'', or the more narrowly focused ''[[The Entomology Encyclopedia|Entomology Encyclopedia]]''.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Dark Harvest|23}}
===Institutions===
In the city of [[Huzuz]], the university [[Al-Bidir Sallah]]'s "College of the Sciences" offered courses in zoology.

The third through fifth floors of the [[Vault of the Sages]] contained study rooms for topics of learning, including zoology.

In any decent-sized city, a sage specialized in zoology could be found with a 20% chance, or 30% in [[Sembia]], around [[1358 DR]].

==Notable Zoologists==
* [[Ainsbrith]]
* [[Bremaerel]]
* [[Elmdaerle]]
* [[Raash]]
* [[Ramazith Flamesinger]] was a sage who specialized in the study of intelligent marine life.
* [[Tym]], an [[evoker]] who authored ''Tym's Monstrous Book''. He devoted much of his life to documenting the strengths, weaknesses, and ecology of various monsters found in [[Faer√ªn]], being especially fascinated by those of a magical nature.
