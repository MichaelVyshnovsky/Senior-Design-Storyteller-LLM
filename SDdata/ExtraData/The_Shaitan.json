Though it moved too fast to get out of the way effectively, it carried a miles-tall cloud which could be seen for an hour before it arrived, even at ground level. The air became cold for miles around the cloud, from which strong winds issued it was difficult to see even a mile within five miles of it, and within two miles visibility was reduced to a hundred yards.\nPeople caught within the Shaitan proper found that it had two forms one of an acid storm, and one of a dust storm. Being inside the cloud during a dust storm, the most common kind, eliminated almost all visibility acid storms were slightly less common and caused actual damage to flesh for up to ten minutes, requiring all people and livestock to take cover.\nAdventures\nDesert of Desolation\nCategoryLocations in Raurin\nCategoryLocations in Southeast Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in the Hordelands\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nd27gdagob050nrot0qxpmsjqgu6qve2"
