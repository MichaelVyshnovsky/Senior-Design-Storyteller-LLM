A '''tenday''' was a [[Faer√ªn]]ian unit of time. The [[Calendar of Harptos]] divided the thirty-day months into three blocks of ten days each, or simply put, "tendays".<ref> The word was used interchangeably with the [[Earth]] term "week".

Other terms used synonymously with tendays included '''eves''', '''domen''', '''hyrar''', and '''rides'''. As of [[1367 DR]], "rides" was the preferred term throughout [[Cormyr]] and the [[Dalelands]].<ref><ref>

Followers of the [[gnome]] deity [[Gaerdal Ironhand]] called tendays '''Tenhammers''', after a custom of striking a metal shield with a large hammer at the end of each day and because ten days was a typical duration of guard duty for them. After ten Tenhammers, the final day was a holy day known as a Great Clang.<ref><ref>
