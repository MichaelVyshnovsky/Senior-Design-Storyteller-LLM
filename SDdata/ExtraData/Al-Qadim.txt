'''''Al-Qadim''''' (literally, "The Old" in Arabic) is an ''[[Wikipedia:Arabian Nights|Arabian Nights]]''-themed campaign setting for the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' role-playing game. Al-Qadim is set in the land of [[Zakhara]], called the “Land of Fate.” Thematically, the land of Zakhara is a blend of the historical Arabian Empire and stories of legend.

Zakhara is a peninsula on the continent of [[Faerûn]] in the world of [[Abeir-Toril|Toril]], the locale of the ''[[Forgotten Realms]]'' campaign setting, although ''Al-Qadim'' is designed to stand on its own or be added to any existing campaign setting. The basic campaign setting was divided between two game products: ''[[Arabian Adventures|Al-Qadim: Arabian Adventures]],'' a sourcebook describing character creation rules, equipment, and spells unique to the setting, and ''[[Land of Fate|Al-Qadim: Land of Fate]],'' a boxed set describing the land of Zakhara, with separate sourcebooks for the players and the Dungeon Master.

==Important concepts==
There are a number of important concepts to the Zakharan culture including honor, family, social station, purity, piety, and hospitality.

Zakharan society is broken into two main divisions:
* [[Al-Badia]]: The nomadic desert people.{{Cite book/Arabian Adventures
|11}}
* [[Al-Hadhar]]: The city people.

Zakhara's society is made up mainly of [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|humans]], but demihumans such as [[Elf|elves]] and [[Dwarf|dwarves]] are present in the setting also, as well as humanoids such as [[orc]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, and [[ogre]]s. Unlike most settings, there is practically no racial disharmony in Zakhara: humans, elves, and orcs alike share the same culture, lifestyle, and social status, and races traditionally considered evil savages, such as [[goblin]]s, are instead valued members of society. The nomadic Al-Badia are predominantly human, whereas the Al-Hadhar possess greater diversity. The nomads and city-dwellers, humans and non-humans alike, are all united as a single culture under a single religion (a polytheistic pastiche of Islam) and as subjects of the [[Grand Caliph]]; the entire continent is effectively a single empire, although different regions, city-states, and tribes have unique local cultures.

Not all inhabitants of Zakhara belong to the shared culture, however; there are many tribes of pagan human barbarians who reject the Law of the Loregiver and the worship of the Pantheon, and certain monstrous races—including the [[yuan-ti]], the vile [[yak-men]] (or ''yikaria,'' as they call themselves), and most [[giant]]s—dwell apart in their own societies.

The people of Zakhara speak and write a common language called ''[[Midani]]'' (represented by Arabic).

Zakhara has a wide [[Zakharan pantheon|variety of gods]], but all recognize the power of Fate. Fate may cast down the mightiest sultan or raise up the meanest beggar. None can agree on her nature, whether the mother of the gods or an elemental force. All acknowledge her power, however. In ''Dungeons & Dragons'' game terms, Fate is not given statistics, spells, or priesthoods as are most deities.

In the distant past, a woman known only as the Loregiver penned the scrolls that clearly laid out the laws of the land, some say guided by the hand of Fate. The wisdom of this Lore was immediately recognized and became the basis of law in Zakhara. The vast majority of Al-Hadhar and most Al-Badia are Enlightened in the way of the Loregiver.

==Characters==
[[Player character]]s in the ''Al-Qadim'' setting can choose from any of a number of character types. ''Al-Qadim'' makes use of the concept of character [[kit]]s, a more rigid layer atop the traditional ''Dungeons & Dragons'' [[character class]]es. These kits are generally available to all characters, with certain restrictions based on the race of the character.

All races are present, including [[humans]], [[Elf|elves]], [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[half-elves]], [[Gnome|gnomes]], and [[halfling]]s, although they do not suffer many of the racial prejudices traditional to most ''Dungeons & Dragons'' campaign settings. Non-human characters are rarer than they are in other traditional ''Dungeons & Dragons'' settings, including the rest of Abeir-Toril.
