        "mainbody": "imension walk was a psionic devotion of the psychoportation discipline that allowed the psionicist to travel through a portal to another dimension.\nThe portal opened with this power pierced other dimensions at right angles, making it better than the dimensional door power in several ways. Perhaps the most important was that traveling by dimension walk was not disorienting in any way. Secondly, the range of dimension walking was much greater, allowing the psionicist to travel up to  every ten minutes. The one drawback, aside from the travel not being instantaneous, was that only the psionicist was able to travel by this method since the portal closed right behind him, leaving any companions stranded.\nIntense concentration was required on the psionicists part while navigating the murky gray of the dimension. Slight distractions could mean that they would find themselves several miles off target when exiting the dimension at their destination.\nThough the psionicist could bring their equipment with them, any magic items that held their own dimensions, such as a bag of holding, would spill their contents once they were within the dimension.\n* Opinicus, a strange breed of psionic creatures endemic to the land of Zakhara.\n* Vhondryl, a psionicist in Skullport and head of the Hall of Mental Splendor"
