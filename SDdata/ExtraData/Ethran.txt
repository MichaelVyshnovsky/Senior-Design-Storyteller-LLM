An '''Ethran''' was the a title carried by a novice [[Wychlaran]] whose skills had yet to be tested.

==History==
Ethrans fell under the complete control of their leading [[Hathran]]s and [[Othlor]]s. An Ethran's rate of advancement often depended on their personal relationship with her superiors. Most Ethrans were [[cleric]]s or [[sorcerer]]s. Thousands of Ethrans were spread across [[Rashemen]], usually serving as village healers or [[spirit]]-talkers.

Before partaking of their maiden journey outside of Rashemen, all ethrans were ordained within the [[Urlingwood]].
