The Heresy of the Threefold God was a belief during the Spellplague that Helm, Tyr, and Torm were the same god. The Eye of Justice was the only known organization that held this belief.
The Threefold God presented Torm the True as the divine holder of guardianship, justice and loyalty from a lawful neutral alignment. This belief spread from Westgate to across the Sword Coast and the rest of Faer√ªn. This belief also influenced its believers to build religious temples that housed chapels to Torm, Tyr and Helm. The misunderstood belief was further sublimated when Torm provided divine power to some paladin Threefold God believers during the Spellplague.
In , Gedrin "Shadowbane" Thalavar who held Helms lost weapon had a vision in which Helm was slain by Tyr and Helms godhood merged with Tyrs. Later, Gedrin had another vision in which Tyr was killed by Orcus after which Tyrs essence merged with Torms, creating the Threefold God. Another believer was Kalen Dren, his successor and former human child rogue. As a religious zealot, Gedrin founded the Eye of Justice from crusaders within his former organization, the Night Masks, but later left it in 1391 DR due to its corruption. Later in the early 1460s DR, he met eight-year old Kalen in Luskan.
The reality was the Threefold God did not exist, but it was a misunderstood status drawn from a limited educated mortal upon seeing the displaying of the foolish deaths acted upon by Helm and Tyr, with Torm as the neutral temporary benefactor. The belief spread by Gedrin and his Shadowbane persona kept Hermites from forgetting their god and preserving their church by the late 15th century DR.
Besides the restoration of Helm to divinity in 1486 DR, Tyr himself was also restored and to The Triad.
