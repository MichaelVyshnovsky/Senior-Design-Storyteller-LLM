The khaldomaun, who was also referred to as the King of Yeshpek or Old Stoneface, was the elected ruler of the city of Yeshpek in the Lake of Steam region of south Faer√ªn.
Ten candidates for khaldomaun were chosen by the citizenry and Kardryn. Both males and females could be chosen so long as they were born in Yeshpek and were not members of the Kardryn or related to current members. The candidates were marched through the town and allowed to give brief speeches, after which the citizens voted for the next ruler.
A khaldomaun could hold office for the length of their life, or they could step down at any time simply by breaking their rod of office.
* Ilbaerth Malklyn was khaldomaun during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
