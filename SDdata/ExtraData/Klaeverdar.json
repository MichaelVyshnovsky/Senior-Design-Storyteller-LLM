        "mainbody": "'''Klaeverdar''' family was a clan of mages extant by the late mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|80-81}}",
        "History": "The clan had been fostered by [[Maxiladanarr Torstren]] during his reign as the Magister, between {{yearlink|1322}} and {{yearlink|1328}}.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|77}} Afterwards, however, the clan continued to be a family of farmers and woodsmen.",
        "Description": "Klaeverdar tended towards robust builds, and men developed paunches and early bald spots, having somewhat longer arms than normal. They all trended towards leathery, gnarled bodies as they aged. Most of them kept fringed beards and dressed in much-patched leathers, and all men carried weapons.",
        "Structure": "The clan had a single matriarch, [[Gueladdeth Klaeverdar]], but three men headed each of the three family's branches: [[Keldeln Klaeverdar]] at [[Snowhills Farm]] northwest of [[Secomber]], [[Baerbuckle Klaeverdar]] at [[Oldturret Farm]] northwest of [[Elturel]], and [[Olbrinhannar Klaeverdar]] at [[Summerfields]] east of [[Amnwater]]. As of {{yearlink|1370}}, the possible successors to Gueladdeth were [[Meldrethe Klaeverdar]] and [[Andrath Klaeverdar]].\n\nThe clan, at large, considered magic a dangerous nuisance, but those who showed aptitude were covertly given a spellbook from their elders and told to practice out of sight. They were able to whelm maybe forty mages of some competence, and maybe a dozen more proper wizards, which they called \"The Gifted\". Any magic a Klaeverdar found was normally given to The Gifted, expecting them to help protect them from any threats. The clan at large saw keeping cities small as something worth fighting for.",
        "Abilities": "All of the Klaeverdar had the ability to feel magic cast nearby, and had a strong natural resistance to it; roughly a quarter of all spells rolled off of them. About one in eight had enough affinity for [[the Art]] to become a wizard.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "To most, the Klaeverdar were solid, stout folk; to city-folk, they looked like bumpkins. Though there were rumors of some strangeness at their farms, there was no general knowledge of their activities.\n\nThe Klaeverdar family legends concerned themselves mostly with the cleverness and resourcefulness of past members, rather than with their secret power, but the story of [[Jaedreene Klaeverdar]]'s protection of [[Oldturret Farm]] was an exception. They also told that some of the Klaeverdar she transfigured were never known to be restored to manshape.",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Andrath Klaeverdar]]\n* [[Baerbuckle Klaeverdar]]\n* [[Gueladdeth Klaeverdar]]\n* [[Jaedreene Klaeverdar]]\n* [[Keldeln Klaeverdar]]\n* [[Meldrethe Klaeverdar]]\n* [[Olbrinhannar Klaeverdar]]"
