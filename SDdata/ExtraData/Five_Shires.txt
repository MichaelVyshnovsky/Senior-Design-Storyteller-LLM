The '''Fives Shires''' were a lush and tranquil [[halfling]] nation on the world of [[Mystara]],{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2013)/The Five Shires}}<ref> that ran northeast along the base of a mountain range called the Black Spires. It was also known as '''Hinhome''', for the halflings of Mystara referred to themselves as hin, Beyond the name similarity, the hin of these two worlds were said to have much in common.

==Cosmography==
Hidden deep beneath the Black Spires was a circle of ''Blackflame'', a [[magic]]al [[fire]]-like substance, and it acted as a [[portal]] to the halfling nations of [[Luiren]] on Toril and Green Fields on [[Oerth]]. More specifically, this ''portal'' would dump one out somewhere in the northeastern reaches of Luiren. In the [[Present Age]], it was unknown if the ''portal'' still existed as of the late 1400s [[DR]].{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-25/Mystara}}

==History==
During a time of pestilence and savage warfare against [[orc]]s, the hin were forced to go into hiding underground for protection and in the process broke into tunnels that predated their own, wherein they discovered the ''Blackflame''. The ''Blackflame'' served as a rallying point for the hin, igniting newfound hope for the future.

In later centuries, the Blackflame would become a cornerstone of the Shires' clans and their [[Wikipedia:sacred mysteries|sacred mysteries]] faith, with each clan stronghold keeping a crucible of ''Blackflame'' within a sacred place and two to three "back-ups" hidden underground. The hin were very secretive regarding the substance and its many powers,

Thus, most of what travel there was between Toril and Mystara was by halfling merchants traversing between Luiren and the Five Shires. The [[Minstrelwish]]es, a mercantile family of Torilian halflings that collected lore on ''portals'' and were interested in planewalking, were also found in Mystara and the Five Shires.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-02-26 - The Minstrelwish Family}}
