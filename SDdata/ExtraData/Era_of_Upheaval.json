        "Description": "Most scholars believed that the Era of Upheaval started with the calamitous event known as the [[Time of Troubles]], that took place in 1358 DR, when the [[god]]s were cast down from the [[Upper planes]] and roamed the land incarnated as mortals. The chaos of the Time of Troubles left a lasting mark on the world. When Lord [[Ao]] destroyed the [[Tablets of Fate]], he unraveled the laws of [[Realmspace]] and the worlds of [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]], separated since the [[Tearfall]], began to join once again.\n\nAmong the known effects of the Time of Troubles are:\n* [[Wild magic|Wild]] and [[Dead-magic zone]]s, areas where magic behaved erratically or ceased to function, were direct effects of the Time of Troubles.\n* Because of the destruction of the Tablets of Fate, the planar barrier that separated the worlds of Abeir and Toril weakened, and both worlds began to exchange small, almost imperceptible parts of their lands between them.\n* Many gods died or disappeared, while dead gods returned to life without explanation; many mortals ascended to divinity as well.\n* Likewise, denizens of the [[Outer Planes]] theorized that the gods of Realmspace became interested in becoming multi-spheric because of the heavy-handed methods used by Ao during the Time of Troubles.\n\nMimicking the cosmic chaos, the political landscape of the world became tumultuous as well. The [[Grand Army of the Tuigan|Tuigan invasion]], the [[Twelfth Serôs War]], the return of [[Netheril]], the last [[Rage of Dragons]], among other huge political conflicts happened in less than thirty years.\n\nThen, in [[1385 DR]], [[Cyric]], aided by [[Shar]], murdered the goddess [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]]. This act ripped asunder the [[Weave]], unleashing its [[Raw magic|raw power]] in a catastrophe known as the [[Spellplague]]. This accelerated the fusion of Abeir and Toril, and whole regions and even continents were exchanged between the two worlds. \n\nMore gods died and others simply vanished. Some gods were revealed to be aspects of others or not gods at all but [[primordial]]s, while a few gods were so weakened after the chaos that were subsumed by other gods of similar nature, or became [[exarch]]s under the service of more powerful gods. Interloper deities began to migrate to the sphere of [[Abeir-Toril]], as well.\n\nWhile recovering from the effects of the Spellplague during the [[Wailing Years]], the political upheaval continued in the world. New nations were created, The major political crisis of the late years of the 14th century [[DR]] were the conquering of [[Sembia]] by the [[Netherese]] and the fall of the [[zulkir]]s in [[Thay]].{{Cite web/Dragon Features Archive|url=http://forum.candlekeep.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=10705|title=Spellplague: The Wailing Years|author=[[Brian R. James]]|date=2008-02-27|accessdate=2008-04-14}}\n\nIn [[1482 DR]] Lord Ao began the Second Sundering as a way to restore the worlds of Toril and Abeir of the ravages of the Spellplague.{{cite web\n|url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140327123608/http://paulskemp.com/blog/the-sundering/\n|title = The Sundering\n|author = [[Paul S.

        "Timeline": "*[[1358 DR]]: The [[Time of Troubles]]. Modern scholars consider this event the start of the Era of Upheaval.\n*[[1359 DR]]: The [[Grand Army of the Tuigan|Tuigan horde]] invades [[East Faerûn]] and eventually reach the [[Great Dale]]. \n**The [[dragon]] god [[Bahamut]] recovers his divine status thanks to the efforts of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], who spreads his faith in [[Damara]].\n*[[1360 DR]]: The Tuigan horde is defeated by the army assembled by King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]].\n*[[1361 DR]]: The [[First Banedeath]], an inquisition launched by [[Cyric]] and his worshipers, begins as a holy war in [[Zhentil Keep]].\n**[[Cordell]] discovers the continent of [[Maztica]].
