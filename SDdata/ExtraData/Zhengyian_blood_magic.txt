'''Zhengyian blood magic''' was a magical practice in [[Vaasa]] in the 15{{th}} century DR that involved tapping into traces of the dark power of [[Zhengyi]] the Witch-King contaminating one's blood. This contamination generally came about after a person's exposure to a [[Zhengyi#Zhengyi.27s_relics|Zhengyian relic]], but it could also be inherited from a contaminated parent. It was akin to a form of [[Sorcerer#Sorcerer_origins|sorcerer origin]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}

As of [[1479 DR]], Zhengyian blood mages were most common among the [[half-orc]]s of [[Palischuk]]. The [[Warlock Knights|Warlock Knight]] [[Mansard Kanaoth]] was a Zhengyian blood mage. <br />
