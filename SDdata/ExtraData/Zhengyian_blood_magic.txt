Zhengyian blood magic was a magical practice in Vaasa in the 15 century DR that involved tapping into traces of the dark power of Zhengyi the Witch-King contaminating ones blood. This contamination generally came about after a persons exposure to a Zhengyian relic, but it could also be inherited from a contaminated parent. It was akin to a form of sorcerer origin.
As of 1479 DR, Zhengyian blood mages were most common among the half-orcs of Palischuk. The Warlock Knight Mansard Kanaoth was a Zhengyian blood mage.
