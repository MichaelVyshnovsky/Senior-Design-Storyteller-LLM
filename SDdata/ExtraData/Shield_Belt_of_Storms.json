It augmented physical armour with magical defences, and added lighting to a weapon wielded by the wearer.",
        "Appearance": "The belt was covered in ornate golden scales with shapes like [[oak]] leaves, shields and swords, and was adnorned with sixteen [[gem]]s. In profile, the belt appeared to be the head of an [[ice eagle]], with a large sea-green gem as its eye.",
        "History": "The gems are older than the belt itself, having been enchanted before the belt's creation. \n\nThe belt was worn by the half-elf warrior [[Dakath]] of [[Nesm√©]], who died whilst he was wearing it. The belt was then taken to [[Blackstaff Tower]] and given to [[Zelphar Arunsun]], who changed the buckle and repaired its scales.",
