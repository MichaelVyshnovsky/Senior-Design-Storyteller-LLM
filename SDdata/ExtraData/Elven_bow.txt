==Description==
A wondrous piece of art, elven bows were crafted mostly from wood, and beautifully designed. [[Elf|Elven]] crafters placed metal inlays within the [[bow]] to strengthen it, making it a suitable parrying weapon.

==Weaponology==
Over the years, elves found their archers were attacked without much chance to protect themselves. The elven bow could be used as a melee weapon, with an elven shortbow used as a one-handed melee weapon and an elven longbow acting like a two-handed melee weapon. These bows weighed twice as much as regular bows, and elven shortbows cost 360 gp and elven longbows cost 450 gp.

==Notable elven bows==
* [[Taulmaril]], [[Catti-brie|Catti-brie's]] preferred ranged weapon.
