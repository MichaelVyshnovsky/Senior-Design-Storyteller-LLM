An Elven bow was a ranged weapon which could be used in melee as a club or staff.
A wondrous piece of art, elven bows were crafted mostly from wood, and beautifully designed. Elven crafters placed metal inlays within the bow to strengthen it, making it a suitable parrying weapon.
Over the years, elves found their archers were attacked without much chance to protect themselves. The elven bow could be used as a melee weapon, with an elven shortbow used as a one-handed melee weapon and an elven longbow acting like a two-handed melee weapon. These bows weighed twice as much as regular bows, and elven shortbows cost 360 gp and elven longbows cost 450 gp.
