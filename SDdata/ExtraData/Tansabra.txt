Tansabra was a drug that placed mammalian creatures in a sort of temporary stasis.
Tansabra was formulated from the venom of several specific creatures.
To have its intended effect, tansabra had to be introduced into the users bloodstream, by injection or other means.
When injected, the drug induced a systemic shutdown in the body of a mammal, temporarily ceasing all physiological processes along with the need for them to maintain the creatures life. Any internal wounds or bleeding were stopped as was its need for oxygen.
When in the "tansabra sleep" the mammal didnt naturally heal and couldnt be affected by curative or healing magic. The duration of this state was different for each individual affected. Any means to reverse its effects, such as rare gem powders and herbs, were a matter of rumor and speculation.
Repeated use of tansabra could prove to be lethal. This variable was only determined by the bodys tolerance for the number of times it could withstand entering tansabra sleep.
