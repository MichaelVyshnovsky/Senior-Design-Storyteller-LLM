Common names for these divisions of the day are given below\n__TOC__\n Dawn  The time around sunrise.\n Morning  The time between sunrise and highsun.\n Highsun  When the sun was directly overhead also called \"noon\" or \"twelve bells\".\n Afternoon  The time after noon.\n Dusk  The time before sunset.\n Sunset  The time around sunset.\n Evening  The time after sunset.\n Midnight  The time roughly 12 hours after noon also called \"twelve bells\".\n Moondark  The darkest part of night also called \"nights heart\".\n Nights end  The time before sunrise.\nOther divisions in common use included\n Godswake  The time before dawn.\n Harbright  From dawn to highsun.\n Elsun  The latter hours of morning.\n Thulsun  The early hours of afternoon.\n Tharsun  The latter hours of afternoon.\n Eventide  Same as evening, twilight, or gloaming.\n Nightfall  Same as dusk.\n Gateclose The hour at which a citys gates close for the night the exact time could vary from city to city.\n Night  The hours of darkness.\n Deepnight  Same as midnight.\nNone of these divisions were precise. Different folks usages might overlap with others. In general, however, these slots of time ranged between one and four hours.\nIn larger cities, bells were sometimes used to mark the hours. The churches of Gond and Lathander were also particularly interested in accurate timekeeping. In such cases, hours were numbered 1 through 12 twice, with 12 being both highsun and midnight. \"Evenpeal\" was an hour in the late evening it was the last hour for which bells were rung in Waterdeep.\nWhen practicing the Art, the position of the sun could have noticeable effects on the efficacy of certain spell components. These times of day and the item affected, as told by Elminster, are listed below\n Foredawn  The quarter-hour before 5 am to the quarter-hour after 5 am. Magical immersions using turquoise were best used at this time.\n Mornbright  The quarter-hour before 8 am to the quarter-hour after 8 am. Any spells or magical writings using amethysts were more likely to succeed during this interval.\n Midmorn  The quarter-hour before 10 am to the quarter-hour after 10 am. Magical workings using sapphires were best done during this period.\n High morn  The quarter-hour before 11 am to the quarter-hour after 11 am. When enchanting a weapon adorned with garnets, starting the procedure during this interval generally produced the most favorable results.\n Highsun  \"Noon\", as above. Magical workings involving diamond dust produced an increase in effectiveness when the sun was directly overhead.\n Waterclock  The quarter-hour before 2 pm to the quarter-hour after 2 pm. Casting spells or other magical processes using emeralds as a component had an increased chance of success if performed at this time.\n Time of summer sunset  About 5 oclock in the afternoon. Enchantments involving powdered ruby were most effective when performed at this time of day.\n Twilight  Around 6 oclock in the evening. Steps of an enchantment process using opals had the greatest chance for success at this time.\n Candleglass time  The quarter-hour before 9 pm to the quarter-hour after 9 pm.
