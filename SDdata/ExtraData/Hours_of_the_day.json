Common names for these divisions of the day are given below:\n__TOC__\n; Dawn : The time around sunrise.\n; Morning : The time between sunrise and highsun.\n; Highsun : When the sun was directly overhead; also called \"noon\" or \"twelve bells\".\n; Afternoon : The time after noon.\n; Dusk : The time before sunset.\n; Sunset : The time around sunset.\n; Evening : The time after sunset.\n; Midnight : The time roughly 12 hours after noon; also called \"twelve bells\".\n; Moondark : The darkest part of night; also called \"night's heart\".\n; Night's end : The time before sunrise.\n\nOther divisions in common use included:\n; Godswake : The time before dawn.\n; Harbright : From dawn to highsun.\n; Elsun : The latter hours of morning.\n; Thulsun : The early hours of afternoon.\n; Tharsun : The latter hours of afternoon.\n; Eventide : Same as evening, twilight, or gloaming.{{Cite comic/The Gathering|15}}\n; Nightfall : Same as dusk.\n; Gateclose: The hour at which a city's gates close for the night; the exact time could vary from city to city.<ref>\n; Night : The hours of darkness.\n; Deepnight : Same as midnight.\n\nNone of these divisions were precise. Different folk's usages might overlap with others. In general, however, these slots of time ranged between one and four hours.\n\nIn larger cities, [[Bell (time)|bells]] were sometimes used to mark the hours. The churches of [[Gond]] and [[Lathander]] were also particularly interested in accurate timekeeping. In such cases, hours were numbered 1 through 12 twice, with 12 being both highsun and midnight. \"Evenpeal\" was an hour in the late evening; it was the last hour for which bells were rung in [[Waterdeep]].<ref>",
