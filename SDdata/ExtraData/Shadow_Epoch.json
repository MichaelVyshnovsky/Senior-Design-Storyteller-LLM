With most life on [[Abeir-Toril]] dead from the loss of heat and light, there was less for the [[god]]s and [[primordial]]s to fight over in their constant battle for the system, but the fighting raged on regardless. According to [[Sarrukh]] legend, the [[World Serpent|Ouroboros, the World Serpent]] led the gods in epic battles against their enemies. These battles ended in stalemate until the primordial [[Ubtao]], in exchange for a portion of the land they fought over, aided the gods in killing or imprisoning his former allies. A new sun was supposedly created, giving light to the [[Days of Thunder]].",
