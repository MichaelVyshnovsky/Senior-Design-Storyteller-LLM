With most life on Abeir-Toril dead from the loss of heat and light, there was less for the gods and primordials to fight over in their constant battle for the system, but the fighting raged on regardless. According to Sarrukh legend, the Ouroboros, the World Serpent led the gods in epic battles against their enemies. These battles ended in stalemate until the primordial Ubtao, in exchange for a portion of the land they fought over, aided the gods in killing or imprisoning his former allies. A new sun was supposedly created, giving light to the Days of Thunder.\nCategoryHistory\nCategoryEras\ngyzxjees2ssa7hm9xxcum6lu21rhsuw"
