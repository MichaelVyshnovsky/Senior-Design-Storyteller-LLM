        "mainbody": "Elemental magic''' was a form of [[magic]] that revolved around the [[elements]]. It was also sometimes referred to by the specific element that was being used, such as '''fire magic''' or '''earth magic'''.",
        "Nature of Elemental Magic": {
            "Defining the Elements": "Throughout much of [[Toril]], as well as the planets of [[Krynn]] and [[Oerth]], elemental magic was traditionally based around the four primary elements &mdash; [[air]], [[earth (element)|earth]], [[fire]], and [[water]]. This was also the case within the [[Domains of Dread]]. On Toril's continent of [[Zakhara]], these elements were respectively referred to as the provinces of [[Wind (province)|wind]], [[Sand (province)|sand]], [[Flame (province)|flame]], and [[Sea (province)|sea]].\n\nIn addition to the four basic elements, some practitioners of elemental magic espoused the merit of studying the energy “elements” of spells. Such as [[acid]], cold, electricity, and sonic. A few even elected to include force as being among these energies."
        },
        "Practice of Elemental Magic": "In the land of Zakhara, [[wizard]]s known as [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]] could cast spells from any two of the four provinces of elemental magic, even those that were traditionally opposed.\n\nWizards who specialized in one or all four of the classic primary elements were typically known as [[elementalist]]s. Beyond the Prime Material, such wizards could also be found in the Domains of Dread. In the land of Zakhara there existed similar wizards, known as [[elemental mage]]s; elementalists in Zakhara were considered [[ajami]].\n\nThose who specialized in only a single element typically avoided the use of spells from their opposing element, proclaiming their own to be superior to others. They also typically dressed in colors appropriate to their element.\n\nSpecialized elementalists often tended towards certain schools of magic due to the amount of spells they offered related to that element. Air elementalists tended towards [[conjuration]],\n\nSpecialized elementalists also tended to relate more strongly to certain elemental energies. Air elementalists tended to relate towards cold, earth elementalists towards acid, and water elementalists tended to favor electrical energy.\n\nElementalists, as well as [[sorcerer]]s (not the Zakharan kind) and [[warmage]]s who were drawn to spells of a particular elemental energy type, were capable of eventually transcending their mortal forms and becoming elemental beings in their own right  &mdash; what was known as an [[elemental savant]]. Divine spellcasters of the [[Fire domain|fire]], [[Sun domain|sun]], or [[water domain|water]] [[domain]]s were also capable of becoming elemental savants. Some claimed that such a process strengthened one's ties to the Elemental Chaos and could potentially attract the attention of powerful creatures residing there.\n\n[[Warlock]]s that practiced elemental magic received their powers from an [[archomental]] patron.",
        "History": {
            "History on Toril": "In {{Yearlink|-160}}, the empire of [[Raumathar]] pushed back assaults from their neighbor [[Narfell]] through the use of elemental magic.\n\nSome time in the 1st millenium DR{{AQ-time}} the empire of [[Kadar]] was formed and ruled by the [[Geomancer]]s, practitioners of [[Earth (element)|earth magic]] and followers of [[Grumbar]], until their fall before the forces of [[Enlightenment]]. Zakharan sages speculated that many of the spells from the provinces of flame, sand and wind were invented by the Geomancers, and assumed that sea magic was developed in the [[Corsair Domains]].\n\nIn [[1020 DR]], the mages of [[Thay]] develop the majority of their nation's unique fire magic.<ref name=GHR> \n\nFollowing the [[Spellplague]] and the expansion of the [[Calim Desert]], some of the native wildlife of the [[Plain of Stone Spiders]] were believed to have become infused with elemental magic."

        "Notable Practitioners of Elemental Magic": {
            "Groups": "* The devotees of the [[Elder Elemental Eye]] often possessed some of the most important lore regarding elemental magic. For instance, they were capable of making ''[[devastation orb]]s'' through use of elemental magic.\n* Within the land of Zakhara there existed elemental brotherhoods, groups of elemental mages devoted to a particular elemental, with the largest being the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]]. Other such groups included the [[Cult of Sand]], the [[Sea's Children]], and the [[Servitors of the Zephyr]].\n* The [[geomancer]]s of ancient [[Kadar]] within Zakhara and their ruling [[Nine Council]] wielded the element of earth.\n* [[Lords of the Tempest]]\n* The [[Red Wizards of Thay]] were known to have long concentrated on the study of fire magic.<ref>\n* Beyond Toril, elemental cults could be found on the planet [[Athas]].",
            "Individuals": "* Antatlab of the Shaking Stones\n* Azeraak, an earth elementalist who maintained a fortress on the [[Elemental Plane of Air]].\n* [[Bastian Termandar]]\n* [[Brack'thal Xorlarrin]]\n* [[Daltim Flamefist]], a [[Halruaan]] fire elementalist.\n* [[Guldor Melarn]], a drow master of elemental magic at the school of [[Sorcere]] in [[1372 DR]].\n* [[Halamar]]\n* [[Imvaernarhro]], an ancient red dragon who mastered fire magic.\n* [[Jhesrhi Coldcreek]]\n* [[Maarika]], a [[frost giant]] shaman in the [[Great Glacier]]\n* [[Miraj Vizann]], a specialist in earth and water magic.\n* [[Morbeoth]]\n* [[Sadrach]]\n* [[The Sensei]], a mysterious [[wu-jen]] who specialized in elemental earth.\n* [[Tisan Balshareska]], the Arch-Geomancer<ref>\n* [[Vanifer]], leader of the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.",
            "Races & Intelligent Creatures": "* All [[fensir]] had a natural affinity for earth magic.\n* All [[genasi]] felt drawn to elemental magic. For them this form of magic was less a process of study and learning, but rather an awakening of their natural abilities. Because of this, they typically specialized in the element that reflected their particular heritage.\n* [[Noble eladrin]] were more attuned to the elemental magic inherent in the [[Feywild]] than the [[eladrin]] of Toril.\n* [[Pahari]] had a natural affinity for water magic.\n* In [[Udadrow]] societies, the disenfranchised and oppressed sometimes turned to elemental magic. [[Lolth]] and her priestesses regarded this as a threat to her authority.",
            "Regions": "* The city of [[Qadib]] was home to more elemental mages than anywhere else in [[north Zakhara]].\n* Water elementalists were quite common in the lands around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].\n* The land of [[Halruaa]] had a great deal of air elementalists. Some speculated that this was due to their [[Halruaan skyship|skyships]] or their connection to the ancient civilization of Netheril.\n* Wizards in the land of [[Calimshan]] were generally specialized in elemental air. However, because of its history, Calimshan society had general concerns over both genies and the elemental planes, thus making it that those who tried to learn elemental magic were rather limited.\n* The valley of the [[Nogaro River]] was once dominated by the Geomancers, and their [[geoglyph]]s could still be found in the 14th century DR.{{AQ-time}}"
        },
        "Trivia": "* Some locations were greatly imbued with elemental power, such as the [[Altar of the Air]] and the [[earth node]] known as [[Nuur Throth]].\n* In [[Ossa]], which had a strong link to the element of water, elemental magic required a sacrifice to the opposite element proportional to the effect of the spell, for instance a bucket of water for ''[[burning hands]]'' or lighting a small forest fire to balance out a minor flood."
