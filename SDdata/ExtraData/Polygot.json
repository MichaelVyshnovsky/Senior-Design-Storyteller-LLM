A polygot cleric could receive divine power from any of the deities in the entire pantheon.\nPolygot religions were common in wildspace cultures and rare in groundling ones. Since not all deities of any given pantheon had a reach that extended beyond their crystal spheres, a spelljamming cleric was more likely to find at least one of that pantheons deities in a foreign sphere than to find one specific deity. As long as one of the deities in the pantheon had power in a new sphere, the cleric would still be able to receive and cast spells.\nFor example, the god Tyr was a member of both the Faer没nian and Norse pantheons, and as such, he was able to grant spells to any visitor to Realmspace who was a polygot cleric of the Norse pantheon.\nPolygot faiths were not limited to spelljammers, however. Even among common human folk of Faer没n, it was easy to find examples of people who worshiped a wide variety of gods rather than focusing on one.\nOn the other hand, most ground-based clerics did not show much respect for the polygot faiths, because of the intra-pantheon politics involved. A polygot priest of the Faer没nian pantheon would not go over well in Faer没n. Did the priest support or reject the dogma of Bane? Was the priest a follower of law or of chaos?\nCategoryReligious terms\nk7aorsfknizxq2f8icxo720zgfe5fu2"
