The '''Dragon Wars''' were between the [[Calim Empire]] and the dragons in the [[Marching Mountains]]. It started when a [[flight of dragons]] destroyed the city of [[Calimport]] in ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-7790}}. This event initiated a century of war pitting [[Calim]] and the [[genie]]s against the dragons. By its end, every dragon in the Marching Mountains died at the hands and magic of the genies. The genies' magic rebuilt Calimport within a year of its initial destruction.
