==List of noble houses==
*[[Ampner]]—A rather undistinguished noble family from the country east of the city along the [[Fire River]].
*[[Balathorp]]— After this family made their fortune importing goods from the cities on the southern coast of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], their influence waned in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]] in spite of its flamboyant, trend-setting patriarch [[Dunstan Balathorp]].
*[[Blacktree]]—The leader of this family, [[Charles Frederik LaVerne Blacktree IV|Lord Charles Blacktree]]. served as Field Marshal for the Ravens Bluff army during the war of [[1370 DR]]. Following the conflict, the Blacktrees created ties with the [[Moorland]] family with Lord Charles' marriage to [[Katherine Marie Blacktree|Lady Katherine Moorland]].
*[[Boldtalon]]—Despite heavy losses during the war, these landowners maintained their holdings thanks in part to support from fellow nobles and civil officials. In years prior, the Boldtalons had built a wealth of goodwill by dutiful service to their peers.
*[[Cathone]]—A shadow of their former glory as of the year 1370 DR, this family had maintained respectable holdings despite losing their vast estate, [[Cathoniar]], during the war.

*[[Flermeer]]—The Flermeers attributed their steadily growing wealth to sound investments in wagon-and-coach-building businesses.
*[[Fleetwood]]—[[Bremel Fleetwood|Lord Bremel]] and [[Jurleena Fleetwood|Lady Jurleena Fleetwood]] had six daughters who were quite studious and enjoyed intellectual pursuits.
*[[Gultoss]]—One of the poorer noble houses that built their limited fortune in fishing and shipbuilding enterprises.
*[[Hawkdragon]]—A wealthy family, with diverse holdings throughout [[the Vast]],
*[[Hawkynfleur]]—Frivolous, arrogant and aloof, the Hawkynfleurs played into many of the stereotypes commoners held about nobles.
*[[Indemmer]]—Careful and cautious with their investments, this family was viewed as being overly timid, often downright boring by their contemporaries in the nobility.

*[[MacIntyre]]—Despite being looked down upon by their fellow Ravenian nobles as an empty title that was fading into obscurity, the MacIntyre/Rolands maintained strong ties to the civic officials within the city thanks to the good sense of the young Lord [[Russel Roland]].
*[[Minstrelwish]]—The only [[halfling]] noble family in Ravens Bluff, members of House Minstrelwish were blessed with joyous spirit and a great industriousness.

*[[Moorland]]—Members of this founding family of Ravens Bluff had long-served as its devoted stewards and protectors, taking important roles in city politics and civic service.
*[[Norwood]]—An old and extremely wealthy family, whose interests and investments within the city could be rivaled by few other noble houses.
*[[Paerindon]]—To their fellow nobles, this family was seen as a throng of womanizers who hid behind the reputation and legend of a single [[dragon]]-slaying ancestor.
*[[Palraedinor]]—Long-tied with the military of Ravens Bluff, this family attributed much of their wealth to [[armor]]- and [[weapon]]-smithing.
*[[Quelemter]]—This wealthy family, who commonly practiced inter-marriage, had a sufficient number of affectations and a unique arrogance to garner a reputation as an odd and peculiar noble house.

*[[Zorden]]—This nautical family, whose holdings included fishing and shipping businesses, commanded a fleet of over sixty vessels.
