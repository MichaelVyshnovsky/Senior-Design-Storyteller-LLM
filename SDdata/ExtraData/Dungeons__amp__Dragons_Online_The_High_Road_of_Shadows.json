After fighting through the creatures defending Sshaastess, the medusa is slain and the ''Scroll'' recovered.

Oriphaun hid a piece there and the Netherese have already taken over the inn, but are unable to find it. After taking out the Netherese commander [[Tarys]], the bartender [[William Windsphere]] reveals that the only thing Oriphaun left was a bar tab—actually the ''Nether Scroll'', flipped over and scribbled on.
