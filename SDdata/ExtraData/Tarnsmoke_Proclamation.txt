The Tarnsmoke Proclamation, also known as the "hardhand justice", was a law of Waterdeep regarding bounty hunters.
The Tarnsmoke Proclamation was issued in 1400 DR by the Lords of Waterdeep on behalf of the merchant Lorigo Tarnsmoke, making it legal for people in Waterdeep and its patrolled environs to hire bounty hunters. This law and practice became very popular over the next decade, changing the public attitude of mistrust people usually had about bounty hunters in the 14 century DR.
By 1480 DR, the Tarnsmoke Proclamation was legal in most places along the Sword Coast, though hiring bounty hunters was something frowned upon by many faiths.
