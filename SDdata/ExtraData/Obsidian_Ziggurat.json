Likewise, shadows appeared to dance in this light despite not being cast by anything. These shadows sometimes took the form of humanoids or snakes, and seemed to move as if to a drumbeat. If anyone stopped to watch their dance, the shadows attacked their minds, compelling them to climb the pyramid and join in the dance. Once ensnared in this way, a creature was unable to break free of the shadows compulsion unless physically restrained or forced to stop dancing. Otherwise, after dancing for a full minute, they were transported out of the Shadowfell and to the corresponding pyramid in the Material Plane at the ruins of SarRukoth. By destroying the altar at that pyramid, it was possible to undo this magic and return to the Shadowfell.\nThe pyramids twin on the Material Plane was a site of cult worship by wereserpents and human cultists. They quickly surrounded anyone who was delivered to them by the shadows dance.\nCategoryPyramids\nCategoryRuins\nCategoryLocations on the Shadowfell Road\nCategoryLocations in the Shadowfell\nCategoryLocations in the Parallel Planes\nCategoryLocations in the World Axis planes\nCategoryLocations in the Inner Planes\nCategoryLocations in SarRukoth\nCategoryLocations on the Lake of Salt\nCategoryLocations in Okoth\nCategoryLocations in East Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\n5mv02i97df7m57wofe12htf7obu89c8"
