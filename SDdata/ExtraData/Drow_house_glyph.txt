Drow house glyphs were symbols used by drow to represent their house and possessions. As well as general house glyphs, there were house defense glyphs, and sacred marker glyphs.
The glyphs were usually limned in black ink or paste, and used by the most noble of drow houses. Defence and symbolism wasnt the only usage of the glyphs they were also marked onto house slaves, such as kobolds and goblins.
House defence glyphs would activate if a being did not bear an insignia of that drow housess glyph. Most members of noble drow houses carried these house glyph insignia, often in the form of pendants.
