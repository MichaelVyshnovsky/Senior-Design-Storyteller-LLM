'''Drow house glyphs''' were symbols used by [[drow]] to represent their house and possessions. As well as general house glyphs, there were [[House defense glyph|house defense glyphs]], and [[Sacred glyph|sacred marker glyphs]].

The glyphs were usually limned in black [[ink]] or paste, and used by the most noble of drow houses. Defence and symbolism wasn't the only usage of the glyphs; they were also marked onto house slaves, such as [[kobold]]s and [[goblin]]s.

House defence glyphs would activate if a being did not bear an [[drow house insignia|insignia]] of that drow houses's glyph. Most members of noble drow houses carried these house glyph insignia, often in the form of pendants.
