Some were used to accentuate one's beauty according to the local custom, Colorful tattoos were treated with [[oil]]s to keep them bright and vibrant. Some experts in subterfuge and disguise created skin-[[glue]]d press-on fake [[gauze]] tattoos.\n\nMundane tattoos commonly adorned the skin of sailors, pirates, and mariners, including seafaring [[elves]] of [[Evermeet]]. Criminal underbellies of big cities like [[Waterdeep]] often decorated their skin with gang insignias, tattoos, and scars. Many \"[[Zurchin]]s\", as [[Zazesspur]]'s street urchins were called, had their faces tattooed or branded after incarceration for ease of identification, as they were not actually children, but adult [[halfling]] thieves.\n\nDecorative [[henna]] bodypainting was commonplace south and east from the [[Vilhon Reach]] as an alternative to permanent tattoos.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-11-11 - Henna Bodypainting}}",
        "Cultural Significance": {
            "Kara-Tur and Shou Lung": "[[File:Kara-tur tattoos.png|thumb|250px|''Intricate tattoos of Kara-Tur.'']]\nTattoos were commonly used as a form of identification across many regions of [[Kara-Tur]]. Members of various factions could be distinguished by the symbols tattooed on their arms. Warriors of [[Shin So Tang]]'s clan in the [[Ausa Province]] bore an image of a [[green dragon]] on their left arms.\n\nSprawling intricate tattoos that covered significant parts of bodies were a staple among members of [[yakuza]] clans in Kara-Tur. These tattoos covered the arms, chests, and backs of the yakuza and usually were hidden from sight, only showing small glimpses when surrounded by family. Among the heavily tattooed yakuza clans were the [[Bakshi]] of [[Ojy-do]], while the yakuza family from [[Pan (town)|Pan]] marked their affiliates with a small tattoo of a blue feather on the person's heel. [[Ninja]] clans of Kara-Tur used identifying tattoos as well: the [[Yamaguchi]] clan's symbol was a small flaming knife, while the [[Amida Butsu]] clan's symbol were linked red circles under their left arms.\n\nIn [[Shou Lung]], members of the pirate organization called the [[Yellow Lizards of Keeling]] were rewarded with a tattoo of a yellow [[crane]] on their right arm upon joining. This was due to tattoos being considered a lower-class marking, often worn by servants. Even though many Shou secret organizations used tattoos to indicate membership, most citizens kept them hidden.",
            "Stout Folk": "[[File:Duergar exiles.png|thumb|250px|''Exiled duergar criminals with bright yellow tattoos identifying them with ease.'']]\nTattoos had a place in [[dwarf|dwarven]] society. Messengers of the Stout Folk bore a small tattoo of a circle inside a circle on the bottom of their throats. Tattoos also had a practical use. Both male and female dwarves had significant amounts of body hair. Some chose to treat unwanted hair with a special paste concocted out of secret ingredients, followed by searing the area with flames in order to inhibit the growth. Tattoos were used for a similar purpose.\n\nAmong the [[gray dwarves]], bright yellow tattoos in [[Dethek]] were placed on the foreheads of criminals, who were exiled from duergar communities under the threat of execution. These tattoos were more permanent than others. The Dethek runes were carved deep into their faces, so the scars were almost impossible to cover up by [[makeup]], face masks of ash, or [[disguise kit]] paints.\n\n[[File:Albino dwarf-5e.png|thumb|250px|''A colorfully tattooed albino wild dwarf of Chult.'']]\nTattoos were believed to be common among the [[wild dwarves]], reputed to be bloodthirsty savages, even though that reputation was likely an exaggeration. The [[Chult]]an wild dwarves tattooed their bodies in extensive brightly colored patterns.\n\nThe diminutive [[korobokuru]] from Kara-Tur were considered to be dirty and unsightly. Korobokuru females decorated their faces and hands with beautiful blue tattoos. Other races and cultures often considered these tattoos quite hideous.",
            "Tel-Quessir": "[[File:Elf tattoos.png|thumb|250px|''An elven [[Akh'Faerna]] spellcaster and her rank tattoos.'']]\nAmong the [[elves]], tattooing was most commonly seen among [[wild elves]], or Sy'Tel'Quessir, the least organized and most primitive nomadic elven culture. These tattoos often included images of their totem animals and spirit guides. Elven society, however, mastered arts and that included the art of tattooing. Among all cultures, elven tattoos were considered the most intricate, delicate, and precise, with the wild elves' being the most proficient among the Tel-Quessir. Elven designs varied greatly and were only limited by the available space. Clan markings, magic glyphs, and even camouflage patterns were common. The most impressive tattoos were imbued with magics that allowed images of animals to move and appear alive on the recipient's skin. Curiously enough, elves, especially those of ancient [[Myth Drannor]], preferred to use skin for their art instead of canvas due to elven longevity and the relatively quick decay of paintings and other similar types of art.\n\nThe [[Akh'Velahr]] of the City of Song used tattooing to indicate an individual's rank. Unlike members of other races, elves believed that military service was forever and the height of dedication to the Tel-Quessir. Hence the marks were permanent tattoos that were applied to the skin of armathors, akh'faern, and akh'velahrn. These designs were small and simple black tattoos on the backs of their hands. As they progressed up along the service titles, designs were added to the tattoos. The variety of the rank tattoos was great to reflect the complexity and a sheer number of elven military ranks. The simplest and lowest rank tattoo was a sword sigil. Officers received blue detailing on the sword tattoo with additional rings added to the officer's palm to indicate various rank permutations. For the kérym rank, additional green detailed outlines were added, and palm rings received silvery ink details. The rank of the Arms-Major was indicated by the sword tattoo receiving additional silver detailing. Akh'Faerna received tattoos of black lightning, and as they rose in ranks, azure lines wrapped around their forearms. Armathors received large black seven-pointed star tattoos. Furthermore, \"medals\" of service among the elves were another form of a tattoo. [[Bladesinger]]s, an elite elven group of [[wizard]]s who used ancient magics and blades in battle, often tattooed their bodies with ancient arcane runes.\n\nIn the [[drow]] society of the [[Underdark]], it was almost unheard of for women to bear tattoos, while males, especially male warriors, were known to have decorative and enchanted facial tattoos. Namely, the [[Dragon's Hoard]], a mercenary group that worshiped [[Vhaeraun]].",
            "Thay": "[[File:Thay red wizard tattoo.png|thumb|250px|left|''A Red Wizard, displaying common Thayan scalp tattoos.'']]\nThe passion for the art of tattooing was extremely widespread, especially among the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]]. These spellcasters bore both mundane decorative and magical tattoos. [[Mulan]] humans were the primary ethnic group ruling Thay, and they most often had shaved heads decorated with intricate designs. [[Rashemaar]] inhabitants of Thay often imitated that custom. Shaved scalps was what differentiated Thayans from the slaves, who wore their hair long. Red Wizards, and those who were pretending to be Red Wizards, always had shaved heads unless on a mission outside the country. Their shaved heads were tattooed with elaborate designs that sometimes included symbols of their favorite gods and incorporated the preferred symbol of the Red Wizards—red flames. However, it was more common among Thayan women to avoid permanent tattoos on their heads. Instead, they frequented shops to have their scalps painted with new fashionable symbols, The same also applied to some men. Some powerful Thayan Red Wizards and Zulkirs liked to tattoo their servants; these brands could be as simple as an image of a thorny vine around their necks, which was the symbol of Zulkir [[Maligor]].\n\nThe Thayan port city of [[Bezantur]] reportedly had the best tattoo artists in all the Realms. Popular designs included visually complex knotworks inspired by the [[Ffolk]], intricate geometries from [[Semphar]], and depictions of [[dragon]]s, [[phoenix]]es, and creatures of [[Kara-Tur]]. Others also decorated their scalps to indicate the deities they worshiped. Some of these designs were imbued with minor magics allowing the designs to move.",
            "Zakhara, the Land of Fate": "[[File:Tattoo mamluks.png|thumb|250px|''A variety of Zakharan mamluk ranks and design variations.'']]\nPurity was a virtue of great value in the Land of Fate. Many human and non-human [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharan]] women wore veils, exposing little of their bodies to casual observers. As such, eyes, hands, and feet were objects of beauty in [[Zakhara]], to be decorated. Women sometimes chose to tattoo their foreheads with simple designs appealing to the eye. Tribeswomen of [[Al-Badia]] valued vanity with tattooing being the height of bodily decoration. They often tattooed not just their foreheads but also cheeks, chest, calves, hands, and feet. Tattoos were visually pleasing patterns of lines, cross marks, and dots, with each tribe preferring a design unique to them.\n\n[[Mamluk]]s of Zakhara wore their military ranks and organization affiliations tattooed on their faces. They often consisted of lines, patterns on their cheeks, and circles. The more status and power they had, the more sophisticated the tattoos were. Imitating or faking these tattoos was a grave offense in the mamluk society. Mamluks who were disgraced or committed severe crimes had their facial tattoos forcefully and painfully removed with [[pumice]] brushes. Veils were not allowed in the Mamluk slave-soldier society as they obscured the facial tattoos. Recently created [[undead]] Zakharan [[crypt servant]]s often wore their mamluk face tattoos."

        "Tattoo Variations": {
            "Religion": "*[[Bane]]: Chosen priests of Bane often tattooed their cheeks and chins with blood-colored diamond-shaped tattoos and had a single round [[ruby]] affixed to their foreheads.\n*[[Beshaba]]: Female priests of the Lady of Misfortune bore tattoos of her holy symbol—black antlers—on their insteps and a tattoo that signified their rank on the thigh. Males received tattoos of Beshaba's antlers on one of their cheeks.\n*[[Calim]]: Worship of Calim, [[Selûne|the moon]], and the ancestors was the state religion in the city-state of [[Cursrah]] of the ancient [[Calim Empire]]. As part of their ascendance in the church's ranks, clerics were disfigured, making it almost impossible to identify their gender, branded with [[arcane]] symbols, and given tattoos, and lastly, by some accounts, their genitalia were removed.\n*[[Ilmater]]: Members of the [[Church of Ilmater]] who distinguished themselves from others via unusual powers and dedication to the Crying God were given a small facial tattoo: a small gray tear under their left eye.\n*[[Talona]]: Facial tattoos were popular among the worshipers of the Mother of all Plagues. Her worshipers imitated the goddess's tattooed face by covering their own with ritual tattoos and scarification.\n*[[Thard Harr]]: The dwarven god's favorite avatar appeared as a naked dusk-skinned shaggy dwarf with a fat belly and covered in tattoos. Harr's priests decorated their scalps or shoulders with the god's holy symbol of crossed gauntlets. This tattoo functioned as a cleric's [[holy symbol]] that allowed them to cast divine spells.",
            "Organizations": "*[[Bloodthorn Mercenaries]] wore tattoos on their right cheeks, depicting a thorn with a single dripping droplet of blood.\n*The [[Chill]], a militaristic [[hobgoblin]] mercenary company active in the [[North Faerûn]], had its symbol tattooed on members' right upper arms. The brand was in the image of a fist surrounded by a tattooed white nimbus.\n*[[Clan Ironeater]], an ancient dwarven clan that dated back to the glory days of [[Illefarn]]. The smiths of the clan learned to work metals into ink, which produced glistening shiny metal tattoos when injected. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the secret of these tattoos was known only to [[Derval Ironeater]] of [[Daggerford]] and his daughter [[Veiti Ironeater]].\n*[[Disciples of the Salamander]], an evil monastic order that worshiped [[Kossuth]], sometimes decorated their bodies with images of red flames and magical symbols.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|7}}\n*The [[Fallen Temple]], a cult that emerged from a corrupted branch of the [[Church of Tyr]] in the [[Utter East]], decorated their faces with tattoos.\n*[[Harpers]], some agents of the meddlesome secret society received magical tattoos to allow for easy identification in times of need. While these tattoos appeared completely mundane most of the time, they transformed into the group's harp-and-moon symbol when the proper [[activation word]] was spoken.\n*[[Hatori (guild)|Hatori]], an assassins' guild that took the name of [[hatori]], crocodiles of the desert, and emulated their fearsome behavior. The guild members had a bracelet-like tattoo that depicted hatori teeth that encircled their wrists. The guild originated in the ancient [[Calim Caliphates]].\n*[[Knights of the Hawk]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] were awarded a Hawk Tattoo as one of the highest honors of the Order. The tattoo was of a [[hawk]] in flight and could be placed anywhere on the knight's body. Only bearers of Hawk Tattoos were allowed to petition to join the elite knightly order known as the the Hawk Brotherhood.\n*The [[Kraken Society]] tattooed its agents' chests with an image of a purple [[squid]] on a red background. These tattoos were created using [[squid ink]].\n*The [[Nine Golden Swords]] was a secret criminal society from [[Thesk]], identifiable by a small tattoo displayed in a clearly visible patch of skin."

        "Tattoos & Magic": "[[File:New alliance Azure bonds.png|thumb|''The sigils of the second incarnation of the ''azure bonds''.'']]\n*''[[Azure bonds (curse)|Azure bonds]]'', a ''[[curse]]'' that manifested in the form of a shimmering azure tattoo of thorn vines and waves that encircled glyphs that represented the individuals or organizations who created the ''azure bonds''. The ritual was developed by evil the wizard [[Cassana]] and her dark alliance. After their defeat, the curse was recreated by the [[New Alliance of the Bonds]] and continued to be used by clandestine criminal organizations of the [[Moonsea]]. The ''azure bonds'' could not be removed by any means. Attempts to cast any [[divination]] magic on the bonds resulted in a violent blinding display of arcane pyrotechnics and attempts to ''[[dispel magic]]'' always failed and sent the branded individual into a murderous rage and forced them to slay the caster. The victims of the ''azure bonds'' were forced to fulfill the bonds' masters' tasks when meeting certain criteria. Upon the death or severing of the bond between the branded individual and the creators of the ''azure bonds'', the sigil disappeared, leaving the shimmering magical tattoo of a rose flower and thorny vines. This remnant of the curse was just as permanent.\n*''[[Create enchanted tattoo]]'' was a popular Thayan spell that imprinted magics in the form of tattoos up the recipient's skin. The power and types of magics varied depending on the caster's skill and ability to use a tattooist needle. A single person could not bear more than three of these decorations at a time.\n*[[Geomancy]]: [[Tisan Balshareska]], the Sunderer of Dreams and the most powerful Zakharan [[geomancer]], had her hands, arms, legs, neck, and face decorated with [[enchanted]] golden tattoos. These decorations were ''[[geoglyph]]s'', magical tattoos that granted Tisan Balshareska permanent protections from several spells. These ''geoglyphs'' functioned as a combination of ''[[permanency]]'' and ''[[alacrity]]'' sells. Tisan's ''geoglyphs'' were imbued with protection from ''[[lifeproof]]'', ''[[comprehend languages]]'', ''[[detect invisibility]]'', ''[[protection from normal missiles]]'', ''[[read magic]]'', ''[[tongues]]'', and ''[[wizard sight]]''. When in use, ''geoglyphs'' glowed with white, gold, or red radiance.\n*''[[The Needle of Fate]]'', a small enchanted tattoo needle with an inexhaustible supply of multi-colored ink. Tattoos created with the ''needle'' came to life while the recipient slept and attempted to murder them.{{Cite dragon/252/Legacy of Decay|38}}\n*''[[Neth tattoo]]'' was ancient magic created in the Empire of [[Netheril]]. ''Neth tattoos'' were enchanted drawings that were inscribed on the target's forearms or necks. These tattoos discharged their magical effect at the wearer's will. The tattoo was a living and flowing image that was determined by the recipient.\n*A ''[[rune tattoo]]'' was a type of temporary enchanted tattoo that could be purchased and applied to one's skin. These tattoos glowed with arcane radiance but were nothing more than an impressive decoration, sometimes used by individuals who did business in [[Sembia]].\n*''[[Spirit tattoo]]s'' were created by the [[Nubari]] of the [[Malatran Plateau]]. At a price of painful application, these magic body decorations positively affected the recipient.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Legacy of the Headshrinker|9}}\n*''[[Stamp of Tan Chin]]'': A magical tattoo that was stamped onto its victims by the monstrous [[dowagu]], foul creations of Raja [[Ambuchar Devayam]] in [[Shou Lung]]. These tattoos were placed on foreheads and could not be removed or even covered. Spells used to mask or remove these brands (including ''[[wish]]'') failed, while mundane things like makeup or hats were removed and thrown off the branded people's heads. These brands remained on the heads of the dowagus' victims, reanimating them after death and forcing them into servitude under the [[necromancer]] Raja.\n*''[[Tattoo of power]]'': This spell belonged to [[alteration]] and [[evocation]] schools of magic and found use in the land of Zakhara. This spell allowed the caster to implant spells onto the target's skin. The spell contained within the enchanted tattoo could be released with a simple touch and a [[command word]]. Once exhausted, the tattoo faded away. This type of magic tattoo had its limitations. The first was the skin surface—the more powerful the tattooed spell, the more space it needed on the target's body. The second limitation was the fact that a single creature could only carry up to four ''tattoos of power''. The creation of ''tattoos of power'' was done via physical tattooing and the caster needed to be proficient in the art.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1357}} an evil cabal that included sorceress Cassana, [[lich]] [[Zrie Prakis]], demonic creature [[Phalse]], the ancient god of rot [[Moander]], and the [[Fire Knives]] assassins created the first ''azure bonds'' and used them to control their tool, a [[construct]] who later became the hero known as [[Alias]]. The woman bore the curse of the ''azure bonds'' that forced her to attempt to murder King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] of [[Cormyr]]. Eventually, aided by a group of friends, Alias and her \"brother\" [[Dragonbait]] broke the curse, leaving a beautiful azure tattoo of a rose and thorn vines on her arm. Several months later, the magics creating the ''azure bonds'' were recovered and replicated by the New Alliance of the Bonds, financed by the dreaded Fire Knives, aided by the [[Survivors of Moander]], the remnants of the rotting god's cult, the [[Zhentarim]], the Red Wizard of Thay [[Dracandros]] the Mad, and [[Tyranthraxus]] the Possessing Spirit. As of late 14{{th}} century DR, Zhentarim and possibly other criminal cabals used the ''azure bonds'' for their nefarious schemes.\n\nIn [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, [[Iriaebor]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] became afflicted by the [[Spotted Plague]] that took the lives of twenty people before being contained by the city's priests. The investigation concluded that the disease was of magical nature and likely was connected to heavily tattooed [[Talonite]] worshipers that passed the city shortly before the outbreak. An outbreak of [[featherlung]] eventually led to a panic in the city of [[Procampur]]. There, a woman who claimed to be a sailor with facial tattoos was accused of being a plague-spreading Talonite and was killed by a mob.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Sailors of the [[Inner Sea]] believed that tattooing open eyes on their eyelids could warn them of danger when asleep.",
        "Notable Tattooed Individuals": "[[File:Song-of-the-Saurials-GRYPHT.jpg|thumb|''[[Grypht]], a saurial wizard with tattoed head bone plates.'']]\n*[[Alias]], the unaging hero and an ally of [[Harpers]], [[Elminster]], and daughter of the god [[Finder Wyvernspur]], who was branded with the ''azure bonds'' on her forearm.\n*[[Dragonbait]], a saurial hero \"brother\" of Alias who was branded with same ''azure bonds'' as her but located on his chest and hidden by a [[tunic]].\n*[[Eli yn Adnan el Beza]], the Sultan of [[Calimport]]'s [[Calimport/Wizard Ward|Wizard Ward]] in the 14{{th}} century DR.
