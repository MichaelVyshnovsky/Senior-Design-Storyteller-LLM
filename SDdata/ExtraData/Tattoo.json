Among all cultures, elven tattoos were considered the most intricate, delicate, and precise, with the wild elves being the most proficient among the Tel-Quessir. Elven designs varied greatly and were only limited by the available space. Clan markings, magic glyphs, and even camouflage patterns were common. The most impressive tattoos were imbued with magics that allowed images of animals to move and appear alive on the recipients skin. Curiously enough, elves, especially those of ancient Myth Drannor, preferred to use skin for their art instead of canvas due to elven longevity and the relatively quick decay of paintings and other similar types of art.\nThe AkhVelahr of the City of Song used tattooing to indicate an individuals rank. Unlike members of other races, elves believed that military service was forever and the height of dedication to the Tel-Quessir. Hence the marks were permanent tattoos that were applied to the skin of armathors, akhfaern, and akhvelahrn. These designs were small and simple black tattoos on the backs of their hands. As they progressed up along the service titles, designs were added to the tattoos. The variety of the rank tattoos was great to reflect the complexity and a sheer number of elven military ranks. The simplest and lowest rank tattoo was a sword sigil. Officers received blue detailing on the sword tattoo with additional rings added to the officers palm to indicate various rank permutations. For the kérym rank, additional green detailed outlines were added, and palm rings received silvery ink details.

Rashemaar inhabitants of Thay often imitated that custom. Shaved scalps was what differentiated Thayans from the slaves, who wore their hair long. Red Wizards, and those who were pretending to be Red Wizards, always had shaved heads unless on a mission outside the country. Their shaved heads were tattooed with elaborate designs that sometimes included symbols of their favorite gods and incorporated the preferred symbol of the Red Wizards—red flames. However, it was more common among Thayan women to avoid permanent tattoos on their heads. Instead, they frequented shops to have their scalps painted with new fashionable symbols, The same also applied to some men.

After their defeat, the curse was recreated by the New Alliance of the Bonds and continued to be used by clandestine criminal organizations of the Moonsea. The azure bonds could not be removed by any means. Attempts to cast any divination magic on the bonds resulted in a violent blinding display of arcane pyrotechnics and attempts to dispel magic always failed and sent the branded individual into a murderous rage and forced them to slay the caster. The victims of the azure bonds were forced to fulfill the bonds masters tasks when meeting certain criteria. Upon the death or severing of the bond between the branded individual and the creators of the azure bonds, the sigil disappeared, leaving the shimmering magical tattoo of a rose flower and thorny vines.
