        "mainbody": "The Gnome domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with gnome-inspired spells and powers.\nTheir illusion spells gained some potency.\nNovice spellcasters were able to use the silent image, gembomb, and minor image spells. Clerics of some experience could cast minor creation, hallucinatory terrain, and fantastic machine. Those that were masters of this domain had access to screen, Ottos irresistible dance, and summon natures ally (earth elementals and animals only)."
