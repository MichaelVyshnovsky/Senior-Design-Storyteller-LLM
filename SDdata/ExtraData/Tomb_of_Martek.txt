The Tomb of Martek was a citadel in which Martek laid down his mortal remains after his death.
Before his death, Martek used the building that would later become the tomb as a citadel. He kept a number of tests in it to ensure that uninvited visitors would be at least entertaining three of those tests had been solved by the time he died, leaving only two the Mobius Tower and the Black Abyss. Before he died, he stole away the Desert of Al-Alisk, including the ruins of Akhir and the Crypt of Al-Alisk to serve as another such test in his tomb.
Fake tombs of Martek lay beneath each Pillar of Martek, but accessing the actual Tomb required striking the crystal pillar, so as to make it ring this summoned the Tomb of Martek on the air atop the pillar, where it beamed down light to activate a teleporter leading to the Garden of the Cursed. The tomb could only be summoned once a day it was unknown where it went while not summoned.
It was impossible to progress past the Garden of the Cursed without at least three Star Gems of Martek The room itself had fourfold symmetry and doors on every wall, however, suggesting that there were at least three other possible roads into it.
The Grand Hall of the Crystal Prism held a model of the Tomb, missing three crystal minarets those had to be retrieved from the tests within the Cathedral of the Grand Hall in order to access the Inner Sanctum of Martek. The tests were completed in  by the adventurers who had released the efreeti Pasha Khalitharius several weeks prior.
