Roave were a mundane species of spider that were found in abundant numbers in the upper Northdark, around the city of Menzoberranzan.
These spiders were rather small, with a human palm being capable of holding five of them at once, and they were black in coloration.
The inhabitants of Menzoberranzan were known to use the internal juices of this species to brew roavrae.
