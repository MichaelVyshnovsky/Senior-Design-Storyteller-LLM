The '''Al-Alisk''' clan were desert dwellers living close to the southern end of [[Raurin]]. They eventually died off to the [[Curse of Amun-Re]], and a blood feud with the people of [[Akhir]] and [[Pazar]]; however, they continued to rise nightly upon death to do battle with these enemies.

==Overview==
At some point in the late 3{{rd}} century DR, [[Sithal Al-Husn]], a princess of Pazar, was kidnapped from the streets of Akhir on her wedding night by a man named [[Habrauk Al-Nirin]], of the Al-Alisk clan. This set off a blood feud which, combined with the Curse of Amun-Re, completely wiped out the bloodlines of the Al-Alisk clan, the city of Akhir, and the royal line of Pazar within five generations.

The Al-Alisk Clan buried their dead in the [[Crypt of Al-Alisk]], which was approximately {{SI|16|mile|k|long=yes}} east by northeast of [[Akhir]]. Even after the destruction of the clan, they rose nightly to guard the crypt against the [[Lancers of Death]] until the year {{yearlink|1356}}, when adventurers released the frozen princess of Pazar.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|126}}
