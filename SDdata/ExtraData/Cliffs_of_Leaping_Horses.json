The region was known for its large equine population.\nRising several hundred feet above sea level lay the lands known as the Cliffs of Leaping Horses. This arid region extended to the Alamber Sea, where caves were commonly found along the coastline.\nNo true humanoid settlements were found in this region, though outposts existed where individuals captured and trained the horses that gave the area its name. Also, the caves along the coast were known to shelter pirates that sailed the Alamber Sea. The Cliffs of Leaping Horses were also known to be home to significant hippogriff and griffon populations.\nCategoryCliffs\nCategoryHills\nCategoryLocations in the Taranoth\nCategoryLocations in Mulhorand\nCategoryLocations in East Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations in the Old Empires\nm19f3292isozx1f2h1mykgf9prkh47z"
