It was the most well-documented of Calimshans royal dynasties.\nThe Imperium started as the idea of Akkabar Shoon the Elder, the scion of a minor branch of a relatively insignificant noble family with a history of breeding talented wizards. At 16, Akkabar was made the apprentice of the Vizera Wizard Princess Rhynda Ithal of Tethyr. He lived and studied in Myratma with the queen for more than six years until his apprenticeship was over. He then moved to Calimport, where he became a significant figure in the citys social elite after four years of selling his prestigious magical abilities to the highest bidder. After another six years of work, he managed to ingratiate himself into the royal court of syl-pasha Kadar el Tarsaj, quickly earning the right to marry the syl-pashas fifth daughter and, as a wedding gift, had the position of syl-vizar of his home city Memnon.\nAkkabar erected magical defenses around himself, his wife, and his home, while political strife, some of which he secretly instigated, resulted in the murder of his rivals. Within six months, hed gained the throne of Calimshan.\nThree years later, Akkabars former tutor, Princess Rhynda, arranged to marry her grandson Nishan to Akkabars granddaughter Arhymeria to stabilize relations between Tethyr and Calimshan. Despite objections from nobles on both sides of the border, they made the deal, and 4-year-old Arhymeria was sent to Ithmong for the court to foster as a lady-in-waiting. After she eloped with the king, Akkabar wanted to use the girl to steal Rhyndas magical secrets, but over the past ten years, Arhymeria had grown distant from her family. She refused her grandfather, becoming Rhyndas apprentice instead.\nArhymeria and her husband were both in their early 70s when Akkabar managed to arrange for pirates to murder almost the entire Tethyrian royal family, including his granddaughter. He arranged for his grandson Amahl to take the Tethyrian throne, but Amahl proved just as reluctant to be a puppet king as his sister was to be a thief. Unfortunately, he never married nor sired an heir, so Akkabar had Amahl poisoned and placed Amahls nephew, also named Amahl, on the throne of Tethyr.\nAmahl II didnt last more than 13 years before he died, and his son became Amahl Shoon III. To ensure that his progeny lasted long enough, Akkabar spent the next dozen years at Amahl IIIs side, ensuring that he was protected and shared his vision. The precautions worked, though Akkabar died under mysterious and magical circumstances. Due to Akkabars magical extension of his life and frequent deaths in his family, Amahl III was his closest living heir, and he inherited the throne of Calimshan. Now the king of both countries, Amahl crowned himself Qysar or \"overlord of kings\" over the \"Shoon Imperium.\" Amahl granted his youngest sisters husband governorship of Tethyr and moved his throne and the court to Shoonach.\nFive years after his reign as Qysar had begun, a coup was planned by three powerful Calishite noble families who were upset with the change in the status quo. They staged two \"hunting accidents\" that resulted in the deaths of three of Amahls four sons. Paranoia and cruelty became the watchword for the rest of Amahls reign. He became a recluse, emerging from the palace at Shoonach only once to announce his plan to dominate the lands around him.\nUpon his ascension to his fathers throne, Amahls son Aleph began the royal lines tradition of being known only by their family name. He was an ineffectual leader, and history did not remember much of him. However, during his reign, they constructed several major roads. Intended to be used by the Imperiums armies, they would instead become significant trade routes. At the same time, the five massive tidal waves that struck Calimport, Memnon, Almraiven, Manshaka, and Teshburl marked Shoon Is reign, which led to the building of at least two temples to Umberlee in every coastal settlement.\nShoon II was known for his persecution of priests stemming from grievous personal losses that divine magic failed to prevent. He died without an heir and so adopted his newborn nephew on his deathbed. He also named his friend Hazamir al Aktorral riqysar until his adopted son came of age.\nHazamir was interested in something other than ruling the Imperium, preferring to concentrate on his magical studies. The army gained a lot of power from Hazamirs negligence, but they also conquered a lot of territory in the Lake of Steam region and the Shaar.\nShoon III was a spoiled boy, but he was also paranoid of losing the luxury he surrounded himself with. He ordered Hazamirs execution after deciding that he didnt trust him and spent his entire reign guarding himself against outside influences. So focused was he on those he didnt know that he failed to see the assassination attempt of his brother.\nAmahl Shoon IV was primarily known for having people killed. Over 200 nobles, as well as countless others, died at his command. He descended into madness after only a decade on the throne, and his younger brother, two years later, justly killed him. In 236 DR, Amahl IV seized control of the hoard of Rhimnasarl and instigated intense magical research and experimentation among the mages of the Shoon Imperial Court. Many of the artifacts and spells of the Shoon Empire are from this time one such example was the Fanged Shield of Shyk Korort.\nAmahl Shoon V was the younger brother of Amahl III & IV and so had spent his life learning The Art and adventuring, thinking himself safe from responsibility. When he returned home, he found the qysar mad and, unable to stage a coup, confronted his brother. When Amahl IV attacked him, he had to slay him with his magic. A grateful populace immediately coronated him. Amahl V was an enlightened leader, restoring the rights of the clergy taken away by his uncle Shoon II, sponsoring many impressive artistic works and the building of the Edificant Library and an impressive Selûnite cathedral. His was a reign of peace, order, and prosperity.\nAmahl Shoon VI, the third grandson of the last qysar, was a warrior with a reputation for tough but fair leadership. A huge contrast to his predecessor, he only lasted for fifteen months and was remembered for one thing putting down the slave rebellion known as the Harakhti Uprisings. A scorpion sting killed him two days after returning to Shoonach from his campaign.\nShoon IV was a political genius, but he was also a necromancer. These facts made him respected but also despised. The Calishar Emirates grew exponentially under his reign, and trade prospered in the Imperium. Also, by allowing the demihuman realms of Tathtar and Meiritin to grow without his influence, they provided new, nonhuman ways of thinking that, once copied, benefited the empire greatly. Also, his insistence on using undead monsters in his armies greatly angered his generals however, the use of undead, in an event known as the Death Parade, did effectively put down the Tethyrian unrest that occurred in the lands between Ithmong and Shoonach.\nThe Imperium was shocked when Shoon IV didnt survive the transformation into a lich, and his great-granddaughter (whom he had named his heir merely as a formality) became the first unwed female ruler of Calimshan. Qysara Shoon V surprised her court by being almost as good a ruler as her predecessor. She limited the influence of spellcasters that had grown over the last qysars reign and tirelessly sponsored the Imperiums armed forces. As a result, her armies managed to conquer a full half of the Shaar, the Nelanther Isles, and some territory on the Chultan Peninsula.\nNo one knew precisely how Shoon VI became such a powerful wizard. However, when he replaced his mother on the throne after she died of a fever, he quickly began diverting resources to developing the Imperiums magical power. He allowed his mothers armies to act almost autonomously and left the rulership of the Imperium itself to several hand-picked, highly skilled vizars. He significantly improved the Imperiums intelligence network before being betrayed by his guard after only nine years on the throne.\nShoon VII killed his uncles slayers to win the throne, though it was he whod paid them to murder him in the first place. He quickly centralized the entire Imperiums power on himself, controlling nearly everything and delegating little. It would have been disastrous if hed died, but he was such a demagogue that everyone who listened to him speak was inspired to loyalty, and so he avoided the assassins blade. He was a harsh, blunt qysar who demanded loyalty through force from anyone who could threaten his power and believed that the ends always justified the means. When the merchant class complained about a recent drastic increase in crime, the qysar dumped oil into the sewers of every city in the Imperium, set it on fire with magic and burned the thieves out of their holes. However, the fires grew out of control, and more than three million of his subjects died as they burned the foundations and buildings of his cities away. Before the criminals could recover, Shoon had installed his loyalists to run most illegal enterprises for him. Shoon VIIs reign saw the rise and fall of Vashalar wherein a nazir of the Imperium, to impress his qysar, exponentially increased the size of the Imperiums borders all the way north to the High Moor. Unfortunately, this drew the attention of Cormyr, who invaded Vashalar, defeated the nazir, and sent the Imperiums northern border back to the Giants Run Mountains. After sustaining injuries fighting with Iryklathagra, Shoon VII embarked on the path to lichdom. He named his daughter his heir, moved most of his magical research to Debukkher, cloaked himself in illusions that made him appear much weaker than he was, and waited for his daughter to try and assassinate him.\nQysara Shaani was a vapid pawn who always picked spending time in her harem over time with matters of rulership. Those who manipulated her gladly allowed her to continue her lifestyle while they got on with making the Imperium suit their desires. Regional nobles bought the loyalty of the Imperiums generals out from under those in Shoonach, and after 60 years of Shaanis \"rulership,\" the Imperium was on the brink of collapse.\nAmahl Shoon VII was Shaanis youngest grandchild. Sequestered in secret near the Lake of Steam, he eradicated the beholders influence on the region. Then, he gathered an army and a fleet to attack Calimport upon the Qysaras death. After four weeks of fighting, he took back control of the Imperium from the various nobles and advisors who had initiated a bloodbath, trying to gain as much power for themselves as they could. He declared himself qysar but ruled over a burned shell of an Imperium. He initiated campaign after campaign to bring the Imperium under his control but hated and feared magic and made it illegal. He began a genocide of magic users and overtaxed the priesthood. Although he had his great-grandfathers way with words (and his lack of ethics) there were too many problems besetting the Imperium. When Tethyr rebelled against Shoon Rule, Strohm I planted the final nail in the Imperiums coffin, killing Amahl VII and allowing Iryklathagra to destroy Shoonach, thus ending one of the largest human empires that Faerûn had ever seen.\nFRShoune\nCategoryDynasties\nCategoryEmpires\nCategoryDynasties of Tethyr\nCategoryDynasties of Calimshan\n9tpy2wmfkt8rdk2jj41vfsk5b4q3eff"
