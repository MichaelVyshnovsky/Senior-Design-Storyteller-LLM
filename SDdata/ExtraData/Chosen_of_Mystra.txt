Chosen of Mystra gained many benefits from her blessing. They held a greater command over spell, being able to cast even the highest tiers repeatedly.
They also became more familiar with magic and able to detect its presence. In addition, many also developed immunities to magic, and eventually even immunities to disease and poison. They become much more hardy, showing a toughness uncharacteristic of most mages.
Mystras Chosen were also immune to the deleterious effects from the casting and wearing of a mantle they suffered no loss of health or the removal of spells from their minds upon the raising of a mantle or the cumulative daily requirement of the spell.
The Chosen also wielded silver fire, a unique raw magic that conjured a silvery flame with a variety of functions.
