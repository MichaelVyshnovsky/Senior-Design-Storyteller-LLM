The '''Chosen of Mystra''' were, similarly to the [[Chosen]] of other [[deities]], mortals who had been specifically blessed by [[Mystra]]. Due to this blessing they gained access to unprecedented magical power. Mystra's Chosen were all concerned with fighting evil and imbalances in the [[Weave]].

==Benefits==
Chosen of Mystra gained many benefits from her blessing. They held a greater command over [[spell]], being able to cast even the highest tiers repeatedly.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-03-11/9th level spellcasters in the Realms}}

They also became more familiar with magic and able to detect its presence. In addition, many also developed immunities to magic, and eventually even immunities to [[disease]] and [[poison]]. They become much more hardy, showing a toughness uncharacteristic of most mages.

Mystra's Chosen were also immune to the deleterious effects from the casting and wearing of a [[mantle (spell)|''mantle'']]: they suffered no loss of health or the removal of spells from their minds upon the raising of a ''mantle'' or the cumulative daily requirement of the spell.

The Chosen also wielded ''[[silver fire]]'', a unique [[raw magic]] that conjured a silvery flame with a variety of functions.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-02-25/Mana}}
