They helped in fighting, scouting, and friendship.\nBeast master rangers and their animal companions shared a particularly strong bond. As both ranger and animal worked together as one for the same goals, some of the rangers abilities improve the animals natural skills, in a link that grew stronger as the ranger became more experienced.\nIn case of a rangers companions death, a new bond could be forged with a different creature over a period of 8 hours, as long as the creature was friendly towards the ranger.\nTypical animal companions were no larger than a human. as was the case with the dwarven druid Pikel Bouldershoulder.\n* Boo, a miniature giant space hamster and Minscs companion."
