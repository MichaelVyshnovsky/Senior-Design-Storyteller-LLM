How "evil" was defined was up to the societies that interpreted it. As such, evil appeared in many different shapes and forms, and those who committed evil acts often did not see the harm or destruction they actually caused.

By and large, evil creatures were associated with killing, hurting, and oppressing others. Some deliberately sought to be evil in order to please a wicked [[deity]] or [[patron]], whilst others were naturally compassionless.

Some evil beings supported rigid caste structures and slavery, as long as it benefited them. Due to the beliefs of many evil inhabitants, good beings would often try and seek them out, either to convince them of their evil ways, or outright kill them.

==Notable Evil Creatures==

* [[Devil]]s, [[demon]]s, and other natural inhabitants of the [[Lower Planes]] were inherently evil. Such creatures did not choose to be this way, neither did they "tend" towards it, but in fact, being evil was in their essence.

* [[Drow]], as with orcs, were mostly considered evil due to the influence of [[Lolth]], a [[demon]]-goddess. Throughout the millennia of the [[Realms]], many believed that the drow were innately evil, though noble and heroic drow such as [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Liriel Baenre]] proved otherwise.

* [[Orc]]s were usually inclined towards evil, as their nature reflected that of the evil deity, [[Gruumsh]]. That said, it was certainly possible for orcs to become good, though they had to struggle against their god's influence.

==Notable Evil Deities==
* [[Auril]], a [[neutral evil]] deity that was mostly worshiped out of fear.
* [[Bane]], the [[lawful evil]] deity of tyranny.
* [[Shar]], the [[neutral evil]] deity of darkness.
