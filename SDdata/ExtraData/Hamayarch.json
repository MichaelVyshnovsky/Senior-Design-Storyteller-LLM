        "mainbody": "amayarch was the title of a mage-advisor and assistant to the Thultyrl, or ruler, of the city of Procampur in the Vast, and the leader of the citys mages.\nThe Hamayarch served as a mage-advisor and assistant to the Thultyrl, and was meant to be very loyal to their ruler and operated with their blessing. It was said that behind every Thultyrl stood a Hamayarch.\nThis post was traditionally taken by a mage weaker than the Thultyrl, and was the highest-ranking wizard in the court. The Hamayarch governed and regulated the magic-users of Procampur.\nBy the midâ€“13 century DR, three generations of Thultyrls had been served by the Pearl as their Hamayarch. In this position, she strictly regulated Procampurs magic-users, and largely discouraged the practice of magic.\nIn the Year of Burning Steel, 1246 DR, the current Thultyrl chose to liberate the neighboring city of Tsurlagol from a horde of orcs, goblinoids, and other marauders, led by the orc warlord Fottergrim. However, the Pearl believed that the Thultyrl was destined to die young, at the age of 26 and early in his reign, in battle against Fottergrim before the walls of Tsurlagol. Instead, he was wounded on his hunting trip (an event perhaps orchestrated by the Pearl). The Pearl secretly prevented his wounds from healing to keep him away from the front-lines and Fottergrim, believing that he would go on to become a good king and complete the Great Codex of Procampurs laws. Tsurlagol was liberated regardless.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Hamayarch of Procampur was Alamondh, who was in truth an evil mage named Carthoun Misintle with desires on the throne. Alamondh plotted to kill the Thultyrl, Rendeth of the Royal Blood, and take his place under a magical disguise, but was forced to wait until Rendeth produced an heir with the familys distinctive appearance."
