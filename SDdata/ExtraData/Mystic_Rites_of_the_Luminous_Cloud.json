        "Description": "During the Mystic Rites, worshipers would spend time in deep mediation and finally gather together and join in a communal trance under the light of the full [[moon]]. These rites were very similar to the monthly [[Lunar Hallowings]] held by the followers of Sehanine, except that during the Mystic Rites, the ceremony culminated with a supernatural manifestation of Sehanine through a mystical union of the assembled worshipers, that collectively transformed them into a shining nimbus of silver light. The nimbus would rise into the sky and dash across the heavens. During this time, the worshipers experienced a revelation of Sehanine's mysteries, depending on their current level of spiritual maturity. The rites concluded with the reforming of the bodies of the participants.",
