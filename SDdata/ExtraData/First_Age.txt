The '''First Age''' of Netheril began in {{Yearlink|-3859}} when the [[human]] communities of [[Fenwick]], [[Gers]], [[Gilan]], [[Gustaf]], [[Moran]], [[Nauseef]], and [[Janick]] all banded together to protect themselves.

==Description==
At first, the community was known as [[Seventon]], but [[Nether the Elder]] renamed the alliance ''[[Netheril]]''. Over the years, Netheril learned the knowledge of magic from the [[Eaerlanni]] [[elves]] and soon all the inhabitants were becoming [[arcanist]]s.
