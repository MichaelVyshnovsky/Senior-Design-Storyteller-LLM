        "History": "Before his death, Martek used the building that would later become the tomb as a citadel. He kept a number of tests in it to ensure that uninvited visitors would be at least entertaining; three of those tests had been solved by the time he died, leaving only two: the [[Mobius Tower]] and the [[Black Abyss]]. Before he died, he stole away the [[Desert of Al-Alisk]], including the ruins of [[Akhir]] and the [[Crypt of Al-Alisk]] to serve as another such test in his tomb.",
        "Overview": "Fake tombs of Martek lay beneath each [[Pillar of Martek]], but accessing the actual Tomb required striking the crystal pillar, so as to make it ring; this summoned the Tomb of Martek on the air atop the pillar, where it beamed down light to activate a teleporter leading to the [[Garden of the Cursed]]. The tomb could only be summoned once a day; it was unknown where it went while not summoned.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|114}}\n\nIt was impossible to progress past the [[Garden of the Cursed]] without at least three [[Star gem of Martek|Star Gems of Martek]];{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|117}} The room itself had fourfold symmetry and doors on every wall, however, suggesting that there were at least three other possible roads into it.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|Map}}\n\nThe Grand Hall of the Crystal Prism held a model of the Tomb, missing three crystal minarets; those had to be retrieved from the tests within the Cathedral of the Grand Hall in order to access the [[Inner Sanctum of Martek]]. The tests were completed in {{yearlink|1356}} by the adventurers who had released the [[efreeti]] Pasha [[Khalitharius]] several weeks prior.",
