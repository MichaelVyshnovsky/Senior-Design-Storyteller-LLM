Alindluth was a pain-killing drug found in Faerûn.
When a dose was taken, it removed all sensations of pain and nausea, and prevented a body from going into a state of shock.
This dosage of alindluth was dependent on the users size and weight. If a subsequent dose was taken too soon after the first, or a dosage was too large, it was possible for the user to slip into a brief coma.
