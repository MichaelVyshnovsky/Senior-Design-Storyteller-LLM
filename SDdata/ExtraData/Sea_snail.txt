'''Sea snails''' were a variety of small marine mollusks, distinct from [[snail|land snails]].

==Description==
Sea snails often sported shells, the most common being known as [[conch]]es. Some species were bioluminescent.

==Species==
;Hunting knight snails: Otherwise known as '''rock snails''', were a variety of predatory sea snails often hunted for the purpose of [[dye]] making.
;Icebound Whelk: A species of [[magic]]ally altered sea snail that emerged in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] in the late-15{{th}} century [[DR]]. They made their home in shells heavily encrusted in permafrost created by the ''[[Ring of Winter]]''.
;Northern Whelk: A species of large-shelled sea snails common in the shallow waters of [[the North]], such as the Sea of Moving Ice. Whenever undamaged shells were found washed up on the shore they were popular novelties, as their shape could sometimes create the effect of "hearing the ocean" when held to one's ear.

==Ecology==
===Habitats===
Sea snails could be found all across the seas of [[Toril]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-09-05 - Purple Dye and Snails}} This included the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], the Sea of Moving Ice, and the [[Trackless Sea]].
===Usages===
Hunting knight snails were often hunted as their secretions produced an enduring purple dye when exposed to [[the sun|sunlight]], known as [[Oldblood]].

In the Sea of Fallen Stars, the [[merfolk]] of [[Eadraal]] used the secretions of sea snails in a manner equivalent to [[mortar]] when constructing their homes.

==Trivia==
Whelks were the namesake of the [[House of Whelk]], a [[Ravens Bluff|Ravenian]] mercantile house, and they had a white whelk shell as their symbol.<ref>

==Appendix==
===Background===
