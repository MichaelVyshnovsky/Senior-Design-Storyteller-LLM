        "mainbody": "Lichens''' were a type of composite organism, often confused for being solely a plant or [[fungi]], when in fact they were a composite of both. They could be found in various places across the Realms.",
        "Description": "Lichen came in a wide variety of forms and colorations. There were many [[poison]]ous varieties, some that were capable of defending themselves, some that were bioluminescent,<ref> and some that were phosphorescent. Bioluminescence was somewhat of a rare trait for lichen.",
        "Habitats": "On the surface of [[Toril]], one could find lichen in a variety of locations. These included the [[Cormanthor]] forest's [[starwood]] area, the [[High Moor]]'s rocky outcrops, the [[Plains of Purple Dust]],<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-06-01 - Comparing Toril's Deserts}} and the peaks of the [[Sunset Mountains]].<ref>\n\nThey were most abundant underneath the surface of Toril, in the area known as the [[Underdark]], where they and other vegetation received nourishment from the ambient ''[[faerzress]]''. Areas particularly diverse in lichen included the cavern of [[Ched Nasad]],<ref> [[Fluvenilstra]], and [[Neverlight Grove]].\n\nPhosphorescent A silvery-blue variety could be found all across the ceiling of [[Iltkazar]]'s cavern.<ref> The fortress [[Maelstrom (fortress)|Maelstrom]] had many rooms decorated in bioluminescent lichen.<ref> And Neverlight Grove had blue, violet, and yellow bioluminescent lichen growing across its caverns and larger mushrooms.\n\nBeyond [[Toril]], primitive lichen could be found on the planet [[Armistice]]. Outside of the [[Prime Material plane]], a species of red and black lichen could be found in the [[Abyss]], the realm of the goddess of misfortune [[Beshaba]]. The lichen was growing on the wind-blasted rocks of the [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 13: Blood Tor|Blood Tor]].",
        "Species": {
            "Blue lichen": "A rare species of lichen that only grew in the [[Stonebone Mines]].<ref>{{Cite adventurers league/Into the Dark|4}}",
            "Fire lichen": "a pale, orange-white lichen that obtained its energy from warmth.",
            "High Moor lichen": "usually just called \"lichen,\" was variety of lichen that was extremely common in the [[High Moor]] and below the surface in the [[Undermoor]]. It was especially common on rocks in the High Moor and in the region's bogs. It had a pale, greenish-gray coloration and spread across surfaces with spidery tendrils.",
            "Medquat": "a crimson species of lichen was found in hollow logs within the starwood. They tasted like [[lemon]]s and were highly prized in [[Cormyr]]. [[Scorpion]]s were attracted to them.",
            "Mikka": "a black lichen endemic to the [[Great Glacier]].",
            "Wisp lichen": "a dangerous, white colored lichen native to the Underdark. It secreted an adhesive that could hold creatures and paralyze them. It would then slowly digest their prey, resulting in their painful and tortuous demise. The true danger of wisp lichen, however, was the fact that many dangerous Underdark predators and scavengers could be found lurking near them, hoping to get a free meal."

        "Creatures": "* [[Lichen lich]]es typically had their bodies overgrown with fungi and lichen.",
        "Usage": "* Lichen was among the vegetation that denizens of the Underdark used in place of the agricultural crops of the surface, sometimes even using them to brew alcohol. For instance, the cities of [[Blingdenstone]] and Iltkazar tended farms of lichen.<ref>\n* Lichen was among the forms of Underdark vegetation that [[cave bear]]s and [[deep roth√©]] subsisted upon.<ref>"
