The '''Orc domain''' was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like [[cleric]]s with [[spell]]s and powers useful to [[orc]]s.

==Deities==
{{ListDeitiesByDomain|{{PAGENAME}}}}

==Powers==
A priest with the Orc domain gained the ability to [[smite]] foes with greater force, particularly [[elves]] and [[dwarves]].

==Spells==
As they advanced, a priest with this domain could instill terror in lesser foes with ''[[cause fear]]'' and hurl fire with ''[[produce flame]]''. They could increase their battle prowess and weaken their foes with ''[[prayer (spell)|prayer]]'' and ''[[divine power]]''. After their chief god [[Gruumsh One-Eye]], they learned the spells ''[[prying eyes]]'' to scout with and ''[[eyebite]]'' to debilitate their opponents. Finally, they weaken and even slay non-[[evil]] enemies with ''[[blasphemy]]'', guard themselves against [[lawful]] magic with ''[[cloak of chaos]]'', and ultimately outright slay beings with ''[[power word, kill]]''.
