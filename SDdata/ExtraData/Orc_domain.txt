The Orc domain was a deity domain that granted divine spellcasters like clerics with spells and powers useful to orcs.
A priest with the Orc domain gained the ability to smite foes with greater force, particularly elves and dwarves.
As they advanced, a priest with this domain could instill terror in lesser foes with cause fear and hurl fire with produce flame. They could increase their battle prowess and weaken their foes with prayer and divine power. After their chief god Gruumsh One-Eye, they learned the spells prying eyes to scout with and eyebite to debilitate their opponents. Finally, they weaken and even slay non-evil enemies with blasphemy, guard themselves against lawful magic with cloak of chaos, and ultimately outright slay beings with power word, kill.
