'''Muzzles''' were a piece of equipment fastened over a creature's mouth to keep it from biting.

==Description==
Muzzles often consisted of [[leather]] straps and metal buckles. Muzzled creatures were capable of breathing, but they could not bite or eat.

==Varieties==
There existed some [[magical item|magical]] muzzles that would expand or contract so that they could fit any creature.

==Notable Users==
* In the land of [[Halruaa]], the land's [[Halruaan behir|domestic behirs]] often had muzzles put on them that were made of leather and [[electrum]].<ref>
* In [[Chult]], most events in the [[dinosaur races]] of [[Port Nyanzaru]] required that the racing [[dinosaur]]s be muzzled.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, five [[bear]]s roused from their annual hibernation by overzealous hunters were led in short [[leash]]ed muzzles through the streets of [[Zhentil Keep]] as the front of a procession of captive beasts, monsters, and sentient beings, as part of a [[Cyricist]] religious festival.<ref>
