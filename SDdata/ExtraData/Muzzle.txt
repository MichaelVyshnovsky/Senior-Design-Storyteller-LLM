Muzzles were a piece of equipment fastened over a creatures mouth to keep it from biting.
Muzzles often consisted of leather straps and metal buckles. Muzzled creatures were capable of breathing, but they could not bite or eat.
There existed some magical muzzles that would expand or contract so that they could fit any creature.
* In the land of Halruaa, the lands domestic behirs often had muzzles put on them that were made of leather and electrum.
* In Chult, most events in the dinosaur races of Port Nyanzaru required that the racing dinosaurs be muzzled.
In the , five bears roused from their annual hibernation by overzealous hunters were led in short leashed muzzles through the streets of Zhentil Keep as the front of a procession of captive beasts, monsters, and sentient beings, as part of a Cyricist religious festival.
