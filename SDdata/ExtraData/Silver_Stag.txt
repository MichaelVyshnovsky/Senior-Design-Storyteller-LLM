The office of '''Silver Stag''' was one of the [[High Heralds]] of the [[Heralds of Faerûn]].

At its inception, Silver Stag was charged with supporting the practice of [[heraldry]] in the lands of [[Impiltur]], [[Thesk]], [[Damara]], and the independent cities of [[northeast Faerûn]]. Silver Stag was also tasked with maintaining and administering heraldry in lands east of the Inner Sea.

The Silver Stag office was based out of the Stormspire in the center of the town of [[Songhal]] in [[Impiltur]]. 

==History==
In the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], [[Ilvarthaele Everstone]], once a [[scribe]] and [[loremaster]] in the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]], was selected by the High Heralds to join them as a High Herald herself. She was also permitted to establish a new High Herald office, that of the Silver Stag, which she based in the Stormspire in Songhal near the end of that year. This was the first time a new High Herald post had been created in the lands around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] since the Heralds had been founded in the [[992 DR|Year of the Watching Helm, 992 DR]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|59}}
