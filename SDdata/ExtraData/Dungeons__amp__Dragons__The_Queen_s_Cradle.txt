==Synopsis==
A group of adventurers—[[Mora]], a [[goliath]] [[paladin]] of [[Torm]]; [[Tally]], a [[gnome]] [[wizard]]; [[Luzum]], a [[gold dwarf]] [[monk]]; and [[Ahokal]], a [[half-orc]] [[druid]]—attack a Cult of the Dragon cell one evening and rescue a boy named [[Solon (human)|Solon]], who is apparently being taken to be sacrificed at the [[Well of Dragons]]. His body is [[tattoo]]ed with [[Iokharic]] script and he hears voices speaking in [[Draconic language|Draconic]]. Mora speaks of her violent past and reformed nature to Solon. She gifts him her gold symbol of Torm.

Seeking aid, they go to the [[gold dragon]] [[Oriel]]. Outside his lair, Dragon Cultists led by a [[lich]] attack and are held off by the heroes. Inside, Oriel removes the evil force inside Solon and absorbs it. But Oriel is consumed by it from within, transforming into an [[avatar]] of the dragon goddess [[Tiamat]]. She dragon breath attacks the group, but Solon displays [[cleric]] powers with the [[holy symbol]] of Torm and wards off her flame. The adventurers stay to confront Tiamat. There the story ends.
