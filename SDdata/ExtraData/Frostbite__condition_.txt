Frostbite was a skin injury that could develop from exposure to extreme low temperatures, below , causing the freezing of the skin or other tissues.
Ordinarily, only exposed or improperly covered flesh was susceptible to this condition, most often occurring first in vulnerable extremities like the ears, fingers, and toes. In extreme cases entire hands, feet, or even limbs could become frostbitten.
The freezing of body tissue stopped blood flow within the affected area, and suffer from impeded movement, becoming clumsy.
If one were to touch metal with frostbitten skin, it could cause moisture on the skin to freeze to it and pulling away could leave a layer of skin behind.
People exposed to low temperatures for prolonged periods were at greatest risk, or those engaging in the Winter Palaces wet parades during the winter season.
The fists of a qorrashi, genies of ice and cold, could magically inflict frostbite.
Wearing proper insulated dress in areas of severe cold, such as the dress of the Ulutiuns, helped to prevent or minimize at-risk body tissue to just the face and wrists (if a gap existed between any gloves and coat). However, the feet and hands could still become frostbitten if snow got inside and melted in ones footwear or gloves.
Spells that protected against cold or severe weather conditions could prevent the condition, such as glowglory, resist cold, and warmth. However, such spells would not reverse adverse effects from those already suffering from frostbite. The spell control temperature, 10 radius could aid in the recovery of those afflicted with frostbite.
It was popularly believed that rubbing snow on a frostbitten area would aid in its treatment, though this was in actuality untrue and its friction could worsen any adverse effects.
