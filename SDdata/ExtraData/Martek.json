He was legendary in his power, and particularly known for his prophecy that the [[Efreeti|efreet]] [[Khalitharius]] would break free of his binding. In {{yearlink|1356}}, he was resurrected by adventurers at the end of a long, convoluted quest he had designed a thousand years prior.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|4}}",
        "History": {
            "Rulership": "Before the [[River Athis]] dried, Martek ruled over lands downstream of [[Medinat Muskawoon]]. He also had a citadel, to which people could be transported by any [[Pillar of Martek]]. Inside his citadel, Martek hosted several courses to test whether uninvited guests were at least worth his time. Three such tests had been completed successfully in his life.",
            "Binding of Khalitharius": "Martek began preparing for the end of Pasha Khalitharius' imprisonment at least 50 years before the latter even arrived in [[Raurin]], somewhere around the year {{yearlink|300}}. Before the River Athis dried, Martek had gave the [[Star of Mo-Pelar]] to the pharaoh [[Amun-Re]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|5}} The star-gem was named by the pharaoh as a key component of the curse that dried the river.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|30}} He also gave the [[Star of Shah-Pelar]] to another pharaoh of the desert; it was stolen at some point afterwards by [[Badr Al-Mosak]], who had it displayed in his [[Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak|crypt]].\n\nOver 1000 years before {{yearlink|1356}}{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|94}} After an extended battle, Martek emerged victorious, having bound the [[efreet]] into a lead box, though their battle unleashed energies that set the desert for tens of miles around on fire for a score years, creating the [[Skysea]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|95}}",
            "Prophecy": "Martek began (or rather, resumed) preparations shortly after capturing Khalitharius, penning a prophecy that the efreet would be released a thousand years from then, and his Sphere of Power would be required in order to save Raurin from the efreet's rampage.\n\nHe gave the efreet's prison to the Lord of [[Pazar]], along with the [[Star of Aga-Pelar]] as payment for keeping the genie imprisoned.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|96}}{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|107}} and the pillar at the center of the city to deliver a message about it.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|100}}\n\nHe also teleported to the [[Citadel of Ice and Steel]] in the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], where in an audience with the Caliph of all [[djinn]] he convinced his Vizier, [[Aeraldoth]], to allow himself to be bound for a thousand years to do battle with the efreet once the latter was released. Martek bound the genie in a bottle, which he concealed in [[Phoenix (city)|Phoenix]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|86}} The wizard had created a bottle that required a magical word in order to release its captive; using his magic, he made a mark that would appear on the palm of the bride of the Sheik's son in the [[Oasis of the White Palm]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|93}} He also created two amulets, which he gave to the Sheik and his son; those amulets, when combined with the bride's palm, would form a message on how to release the djinn.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|62}}{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|80}}{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|84}} He hid the final Star-Gem, the [[Star of Khan-Pelar]], in the [[Temple of Set]] beneath the Oasis of the White Palm,{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|74}} alongside a bone scroll case with a map inside it.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|78}} Furthermore, he placed a message on a shrine atop the Temple of Set.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|72}}\n\nAt the time of his final retreat, there were only two trials in Martek's Citadel that had yet to be completed: the Black Abyss and the Mobius' Tower.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|109}} Considering his preparations complete, he had his remains displayed in the citadel, thereafter the [[Tomb of Martek]].{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|108}}",
            "Resurrection": "In the year of {{yearlink|1356}}, a scholar of Martek's prophecies, [[Aman Al-Raqib]], sent some adventurers in a quest for Martek's Sphere of Power, anticipating it would be needed in order to defeat the efreet.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|11}} These adventurers released the Pasha just as planned,{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|36}}"

        "Trivia": "Martek was the author of ''[[Martek, By Martek]]''. He also owned two posters of note, one labeled \"Martek for Shah\", and one labeled \"Visit Beautiful [[Cormyr]]\".{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|127}}",
