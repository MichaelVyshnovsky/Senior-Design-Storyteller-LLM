'''''Bae'qeshel''''' was a [[bard]]ic art known to very few [[drow]]. Wielders of ''bae'qeshel'' were known as the "dark minstrels." The song was keening and magical.

Unlike [[divine magic]], dark minstrels tapped into the [[Weave]], and did not require a connection with a deity to wield it. However, according to Halisstra, it was sung in honor to [[Lolth]].

The songs had a wide range of effects, often involving ''[[compulsion]]'' and other [[enchantment]]s, but they also had more reality-altering abilities such as [[cure wounds|healing grievous wounds]], creating ''[[dimension door]]s'', and producing sonic blasts capable of stripping bark off of trees, as shown by Halisstra.
