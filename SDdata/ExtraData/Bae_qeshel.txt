Baeqeshel was a bardic art known to very few drow. Wielders of baeqeshel were known as the "dark minstrels." The song was keening and magical.
Unlike divine magic, dark minstrels tapped into the Weave, and did not require a connection with a deity to wield it. However, according to Halisstra, it was sung in honor to Lolth.
The songs had a wide range of effects, often involving compulsion and other enchantments, but they also had more reality-altering abilities such as healing grievous wounds, creating dimension doors, and producing sonic blasts capable of stripping bark off of trees, as shown by Halisstra.
