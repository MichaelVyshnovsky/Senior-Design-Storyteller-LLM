Several prophets of [[Qotal]] foresaw the events before they occurred and the priestess [[Erixitl]] attempted to prevent the calamity.\n\nEvents were set into motion when [[Cordell]]'s lover and [[drow]] [[mage]] [[Darien]] killed the Nexalan ruler [[Naltecona]]. This caused the native Nexalan warriors to attack Cordell's native allies. During the ensuing battle, [[Domincus]], Cordell's bishop, was captured by Nexalans and sacrificed to [[Zaltec]]. The sacrifice of his priest infuriated [[Helm]] and he clashed with Zaltec, which resulted in the explosion of [[Mount Zatal]], which overlooked the city. The eruption of Mount Zatal toppled many of the buildings in Nexal, including some of the pyramids, and caused much of the city to sink back into the lakes on which it was built.\n\n[[Lolth]] took advantage of the chaos and cursed Nexal's warriors, turning them into [[orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[troll]]s. As punishment for their lack of faith, she turned the [[Ancient Ones]] from [[drow]] into [[drider]]s. The few Nexalans who survived the disaster fled the city and it was left in ruins.",
