The '''Dahaunarch''' was the lowest-ranking and least-prestigious seat on the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]], the governing body that ruled over [[Amn]] during the latter half of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

At some point during the late 14{{th}} century or 15{{th}} century, the council eliminated the seat of the Dahaunarch, which transitioned the Council of Six into the [[Council of Five (Amn)|Council of Five]].

==Responsibilities==
The Dahaunarch was entrusted with the command of the [[Amn]]ian military, which comprised about one half the forces at the council's disposal, with personal armies and individual agents taken into account.
