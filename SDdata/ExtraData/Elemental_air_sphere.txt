The Elemental Air sphere was a group of spells that manipulated the element of air. Originally, druids were granted unlimited access and clerics were granted minor access to these spells.  Optionally, clerics were denied these spells.
Many spells were available to those who had chosen this sphere.
Beginner spellcasters of this sphere could cast
* wind column
Novice divine spellcasters were able to cast
* dust devil
Somewhat skilled spellcasters were able to cast
* water/air breathingThis spell was removed from the elemental air sphere in the Players Option Spells & Magic sourcebook. See page 186. Since this spell is reversible and is applicable to allowing water-breathing creatures to survive in air, this is probably a misprint.
* wind servant
* zone of sweet air
Intermediate clerics and druids had the ability to cast
* windborne
Those with a high level of skill had access to
* air walk
* cloud of purificationThis spell was designated as belonging to both the elemental air sphere and elemental water sphere on page 89 of the Tome of Magic 2nd edition.

* control windsThis spell was added to the elemental air sphere by the Players Option Spells & Magic sourcebook. See page 186.
