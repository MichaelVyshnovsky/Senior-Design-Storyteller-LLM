The '''Elemental Air sphere''' was a group of spells that manipulated the element of [[air]]. Originally, [[druid]]s were granted unlimited access and [[clerics]] were granted minor access to these spells.  Optionally, [[cleric]]s were denied these spells.

==Spells in the Sphere of Elemental Air==
Many spells were available to those who had chosen this sphere.

Beginner spellcasters of this sphere could cast:
* ''[[wind column]]''
Novice divine spellcasters were able to cast:
* ''[[dust devil]]''
Somewhat skilled spellcasters were able to cast:
* ''[[water breathing|water/air breathing]]''<ref group="note">This spell was removed from the elemental air sphere in the ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'' sourcebook. See page 186. Since this spell is reversible and is applicable to allowing water-breathing creatures to survive in air, this is probably a misprint.
* ''[[wind servant]]''
* ''[[zone of sweet air]]''
Intermediate clerics and druids had the ability to cast:
* ''[[windborne]]''
Those with a high level of skill had access to:
* ''[[air walk]]''
* ''[[cloud of purification]]''<ref group="note">This spell was designated as belonging to both the ''elemental air sphere'' and ''elemental water sphere'' on page 89 of the ''[[Tome of Magic 2nd edition]]''. However, it does not show up in the elemental water sphere in the list of spells by sphere on page 153, nor in the updated list on page 187 of the ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'' sourcebook.
* ''[[control winds]]''<ref group="note">This spell was added to the ''elemental air sphere'' by the ''[[Player's Option: Spells & Magic]]'' sourcebook. See page 186.
Powerful spellcasters of such a sphere were able to cast:
* ''[[whirlwind]]''
Divine spellcasters who had mastered this sphere could cast:
