[[Druid]]s who took up the cause of nature in such a climate had an affinity for this circle and the suite of [[spell]]s that came with them.",
        "Arctic circle spells": "Fairly new druids could cast both ''[[hold person]]'' and ''[[spike growth]]''. More versed druids could use the ''[[sleet storm]]'', ''[[slow]]'', ''[[freedom of movement]]'', and ''[[ice storm]]'' spells. Those that had gained significant skill in such a circle could cast ''[[commune with nature]]'' and ''[[cone of cold]]''."
