It might just use its death ray next...\nDeath magic was an effect that guaranteed death, usually immediately, though it was possible to resist it.Note that death magic was not specifically linked to necromancy. Several schools of magic utilized death magic, such as evocation, conjuration, abjuration, etc.\nDeath magic came in many forms, the most common of which were spells, such as finger of death, and supernatural creature abilities, such as a beholders death ray. some involving transportation to other planes, or otherwise. Most of these effects could specifically cause instant-death to an inhabitant if they failed to resist it. Death magic was not dependent on the amount of damage a spell or effect could deal. As such, a highly powerful fireball was not a form a death magic, even though it could kill most beings outright.\nAlmost all death magic caused instantaneous death. However, some forms, such as the effect of breath of death spell, instead instantly infected a being with a fatal disease. The infected beings were unable to heal naturally or via magical curing, meaning they would certainly die, unless they somehow found a way around it. \nAnother form of death magic was noted to exist in Constabulary Branch One of Karsus Enclave in Netheril. A net of interwoven spells within this maze-like building could cause a refraction effect, causing the being to instantly undergo reincarnation.\nWhen travelling to the Ethereal plane, i.e., via blink or ethereal jaunt, it was possible to reappear inside of a solid object. Failing to resist this form of death magic would cause instant death, though managing to resist it would cause the affected being to plummet into the Deep Ethereal.\nThere were several spells that utilized death magic, such as finger of death, implosion, death spell, power word, kill, and black blade of disaster. Some of these spells drew magic from either the Negative (or positive) energy plane in order to harm good (or evil) creatures. Spells that involved death magic could be resisted by the death ward spell, as long as it was cast on the target beforehand. \nSome notable spells were\n* Slay living, the reverse of raise dead, would instantly kill a target if they could not save themselves against its death magic.\n* The great circle spell, a very powerful spell that could only be cast by a group of of four or more priests. It instantly destroyed all lesser undead within a huge radius, though it was possible for other evil beings to resist the death magic. The opposite of this spell, the black circle, had a similar effect on goodly creatures, especially if they were paladins or good-aligned priests.\nthumb|right|240px|A nabassu waits to use its death-stealing gaze upon its foe.\n* Nabassu, known as death stealers, were able to \"steal the death\" of their victims via a deadly gaze. As such, the victims would not experience death at such a moment, but instead would become a ghast or a ghoul as soon as they were actually killed. The ghoul or ghast would become controllable by the nabassu. As the nabassu had already \"stolen death\", it was able to bestow the stolen death upon a victim, instantly killing them.\n* Ochimo, evil spirit warriors from Kara-Tur, whose gaze could capture the entire spirit of a being.\n* Tyranthraxus, the possessing spirit, was known to literally transfer his life force into anothers body.\n* Modanic and movanic devas, and solars, goodly outsiders that were immune to death magic in all forms.\n* Kamerynn, a highly intelligent, powerful, and death magic-immune unicorn that lived on the Moonshae Isles."
