The '''Grand Design''' was an [[illithid]] philosophy that involved the re-establishment of the once-great [[Illithid Empire]].

{{Quote|The Grand Design. Order. Perfection. Unity. Every plane as one. Every being in their place.|''An illithid [[netherbrain|elder brain]].''}}

==Description==
{{Quote|The Grand Design is what all ''ghaik'' seek. The restoration of the Illithid Empire, which spanned the entirety of the [[multiverse]]. For centuries, their elder brains sought to bring back their dominion.|Ch'r'ai [[W'wargaz]].}}

The idea of the Grand Design was to rebuild the lost empire of the mind flayers. Mind flayers would work on accomplishing the Grand Design as soon as they had established their colonies.

Part of the Grand Design involved enslaving (or eliminating) all [[gith (race)|gith]], as they once had, as well as other [[humanoid]]s. To achieve the Grand Design, illithids spent much time studying different phenomena and subjects, such as the culture of other creatures.

Illithid colonies had different methods of contributing to the Grand Design. Some may have thought to rediscover the method of creating [[nautiloid]]s, whilst others may have thought to find and destroy the homes of the gith.

==Resistance==
{{Quote
|I have broken free from the [[elder brain]]'s yoke. I no longer serve the Grand Design.
|[[Omeluum]]
}}
Not all mind flayers wished to further the efforts of the Grand Design. In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], an illithid, known as Omeluum, had broken free from the elder brain's influence. As such, it no longer served the Grand Design.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, an [[netherbrain|elder brain]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] manipulated the [[chosen]] of the [[Dead Three]] into "enslaving" it with an [[Crown of Karsus|ancient artifact]], in order to further the schemes of their gods. In truth, the elder brain sought inflict [[ceremorphosis]] upon hundreds of thousands of innocent mortals in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] and the [[Sword Coast]] beyond, in furtherance of the Grand Design.
