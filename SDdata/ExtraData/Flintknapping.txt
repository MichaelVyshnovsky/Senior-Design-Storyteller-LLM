Flintknapping was a skill and craft used by the Azuposi people of the Pasocada Basin of Maztica.
Flintknapping was similar to obsidian working, but specifically for flint. Flint was easier to work with when compared to obsidian. The Azuposi used flint to create sharpened heads for arrows, spears, daggers, and even axes. Someone with experience could produce arrowheads at the rate of 1–4 per hour, spearheads at a rate of 1–4 per day, and a single dagger or axehead per day.
