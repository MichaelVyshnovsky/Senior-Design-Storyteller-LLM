'''Jester's magic''' was a tradition of [[arcane]] [[magic]] commonly practiced by [[jester]]s and clowns in and around [[Waterdeep]]. It focused on magical pranks and jests that could send a target to sleep or rouse them to laughter, or even put them in stitches.

==Training==
To learn jester's magic, one had to be highly trained in acting and foolery and know how to cast arcane [[spell]]s. They could be either [[bard]]s, making up the '''bardic jester''' tradition, or they could be [[sorcerer]]s or [[wizard]]s, making up the '''jester mage''' tradition.

==Effects==
Masters of jester's magic were more potent in certain spells of their chosen tradition. For the bardic jester tradition, these were ''[[prestidigitation]]'', ''[[remove fear]]'', ''[[hypnotism]]'', ''[[Tasha's hideous laughter]]'', ''[[calm emotions]]'', ''[[enthrall]]'', ''[[confusion]]'', ''[[glibness]]'', ''[[modify memory]]'', ''[[mass suggestion]]'', and ''[[Otto's irresistible dance]]''. For the jester mage tradition, these were ''prestidigitation'', ''[[grease]]'', ''hypnotism'', ''Tasha's hideous laughter'', ''[[rope trick]]'', ''[[deep slumber]]'', ''[[suggestion]]'', ''confusion'', ''[[seeming]]'', ''mass suggestion'', ''[[project image]]'', ''Otto's irresistible dance'', and ''[[weird]]''.<ref>
