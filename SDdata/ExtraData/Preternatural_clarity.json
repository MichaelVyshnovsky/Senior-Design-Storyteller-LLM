        "mainbody": "'''''Preternatural clarity''''' was a very advanced [[utterance]] from the Lexicon of the Evolving Mind that used [[truespeak]] to sharpen a target's mind in preparation for a task, or to cloud it utterly, if reversed.",
        "Usage": "In its straight form, by granting the target insight into all that was or had ever been, ''preternatural clarity'' allowed them to, within a half minute, gain drastic insight into a task they were attempting. In its reversed form, it acted like a short-lived ''[[confusion]]'' spell, making the universe incomprehensible to the target.",
        "Known Users": "The recitation was known to [[logokron devil]]s and, in its reversed form, to [[garbler]]s.{{cite book/Tome of Magic 3.5|266-267}}",
