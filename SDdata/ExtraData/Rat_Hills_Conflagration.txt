The [[Rat Hills Conflagration]] was a large fire in the [[Rat Hills]] garbage dump located south of the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]].

It was accidentally started by the [[Confluence]] in a failed attack against the [[Unseen]]. Waterdhavian guard patrols got involved when they spotted what they thought was a group of evil [[will-o'-wisp]]s in the blaze. They engaged the wisps but did not realize that the group also contained some similar-looking [[Nyth (creature)|nyths]], which explosively reproduced in fire. The Waterdhavians killed the wisps but two guards were lost when the nyths began to reproduce.

The nyths went on to inhabit the [[Rat Hills]] and, as the [[Retreat]] of the [[Moon elf|moon elves]] from [[Ardeep]] meant that the monster population in the abandoned realm was left unchecked, they infested the [[Ardeep Forest]] as well.
