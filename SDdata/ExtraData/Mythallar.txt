A '''''mythallar''''' was a [[Netherese]] device that allowed access to vast amounts of raw magic.{{Fact}}

==Description==
This magical device looked much like a [[crystal ball]] but was about 150 feet in diameter. The globe shed a very bright light—similar to the disc of the sun—with dimmer shadows and shapes moving across its surface. An ornate stand kept the perfectly spherical device in place.{{Fact}}

==History==
{{Quote
|The ancients of Netheril were nearly as wise as they were powerful. It is they who first used the [[Nether Scrolls]] to found our empire&mdash;and hid things away in the cleverest of places.
|Archwizard [[Amskar]]
}}
Created in 845 NY ({{Yearlink|-3014}}) by [[Ioulaum]],<ref> the ''mythallars'' allowed arcanists to create [[quasimagical item]]s without draining their lifeforce. This allowed for a rising trade with the middle class.<ref> The first large scale application, the floating city, appeared in the year 866 NY ({{Yearlink|-2954}}), Ioulaum's Enclave, named [[Xinlenal]]. By {{Yearlink|-2811}} (1048 NY), thirteen had been constructed. By {{Yearlink|-2207}} (1652 NY), [[Netheril]] began lifting one enclave into the sky per year.{{Fact}}

[[Sakkors]]' High Arcanist [[Xolund|Xolund the Maker]] improved on ''mythallar'' design by infusing his enclave's ''mythallar'' with a rudimentary sentience, giving it self-awareness and also increasing the ''mythallar's'' powers. This breakthrough caused a great stir among the empire's arcanists, but the fall of the empire prevented any further effort of duplicating Xolund's feat, making Sakkors' ''mythallar'' one of a kind.<ref>  

In the mid-1480s [[DR]], the agents of [[Thultanthar]] uncovered an intact ''mythallar'' buried inside a [[Rungnir's glacier|mountain glacier]] deep inside the [[Storm Horns]], in addition to uncovering a ''[[Abyssal Planus Mechanus Nether Scroll|Nether Scroll]]''. Under the command of Archwizard [[Amskar]], they excavated and ritually prepared the artifact for reactivation, ultimately using it to create a [[Amskar's enclave|new enclave]] made from the glacier itself. Before they could use it as a weapon against [[Cormyr]], the [[adventurer]] [[Oriphaun Huntsilver]] and his companions attacked the [[Shadovar]] forces and killed Archwizard Amskar. Without his control, the enclave began flying erratically and smashed into a nearby mountain, destroying it and the ''mythallar''.

==Usage==
Sakkor's ''mythallar'' was unique in that its sentience allowed it to direct, focus or withhold its magical powers as instructed.{{Fact}}

==Drawbacks==
Touching a ''mythallar'' was a lethal decision. Anyone who touched the device was instantly slain. Any item that touched it, except the stand that contained it, was instantly disintegrated. Any undead that touched the ''mythallar'' were destroyed.<ref>

A ''mythallar'' could be destroyed by a [[disintegrate]] spell<ref> as happened to the enclave of [[Tanathras]] in {{Yearlink|-647}} (3212 NY).{{Fact}}
