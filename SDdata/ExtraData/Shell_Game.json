        "Description": "This con involved three shells, with one covering a small object, such as a [[clay]] [[pea]]. The small object would be covered in front of the player, then the shells would have their positions quickly shifted around. Once the shifting was done, the player had to identify which of the shells was the one covering the small object. Guessing correctly would win one [[coin]]s, while guessing wrong would lose that money to the operator of the shell game. The trick of this game was that thieves would use their skills in sleight-of-hand to remove the small object during the shifting process, thus ensuring that it was impossible for a player to guess correctly.\n\nSometimes players would be allowed to win on their first go, so as to build up their confidence, while at other times the shell man would have an accomplice in the crowd that would be allowed to win so as to draw victims in.",
