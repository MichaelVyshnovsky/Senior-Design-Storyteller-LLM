The small object would be covered in front of the player, then the shells would have their positions quickly shifted around. Once the shifting was done, the player had to identify which of the shells was the one covering the small object. Guessing correctly would win one coins, while guessing wrong would lose that money to the operator of the shell game. The trick of this game was that thieves would use their skills in sleight-of-hand to remove the small object during the shifting process, thus ensuring that it was impossible for a player to guess correctly.\nSometimes players would be allowed to win on their first go, so as to build up their confidence, while at other times the shell man would have an accomplice in the crowd that would be allowed to win so as to draw victims in.\nAuroras Whole Realms Catalogue sold shells with roller pockets within its \"Thieves Corner\" section for the price of 3 gp.\nIn the late 14 century DR, outside of the streets, one could find the shell game being offered in Ravens Bluff among various other games of chance in the House of Thud gambling hall. And beyond Toril, in the city of Bral one could find many booths offering the shell game within its Thieves Market.\n* Gwayne the Gamester, a swindler in Ravens Bluff, performed the shell game and kept its components on standby in his thiefs kit.\n* Raul the Shellman, a human thief who offered the shell game to passersby in the Ravens Bluff market.\n* The Sanctuary of Mask, one of the guildhouses of the Night Masks in Westgate, had an entire room dedicated to teaching its members various types of con games, such as the shell game.\n* \nCategoryGames (in-universe)\nCategoryItems from Auroras Whole Realms Catalogue\nCategoryItems from Bral\nCategoryItems from Westgate\nCategoryItems from the Dragon Coast\nCategoryItems from Interior Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Ravens Bluff\nCategoryItems from the Vast\nCategoryItems from Faerûn\nCategoryItems from Toril\n2ylziwqphpstl1lxa1jwcogd0rz7zi1"
