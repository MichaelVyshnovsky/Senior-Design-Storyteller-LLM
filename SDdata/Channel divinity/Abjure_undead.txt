Abjure undead was an ability of avengers to channel divinity of a god they served.
This ability allowed the avenger to fire a ray of radiant energy that damaged and mesmerized an undead target, compelling it to stagger forward into melee attack range. This ability greatly increased in power as the avenger gained experience.
Avengers did not need any implement or components to use this ability, although it was enhanced with the use of a holy symbol.
