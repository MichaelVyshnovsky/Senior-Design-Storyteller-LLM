Jelzars Stride was a cobblestone avenue
Up to the mid-14 century DR, this road stretched from northeast to southwest, extending off of Seaeyes March and terminating at the Lions.As shown on the 4th map of City System.
By 1368 DR, Jelzars Stride had its cobblestone street extended, overtaking where the Lions once stood alongside the Field of Triumph, making it terminate at Julthoon Street. Along the way it was met from the east by Dobs Loss and Gulzindar Street.
* The Field of Triumph, a large outdoor stadium, had northern and eastern walls that spanned the entirety of Jelzars Stride.
* The House of Heroes, a temple of Tempus that stood on the streets corner with the Lions.
