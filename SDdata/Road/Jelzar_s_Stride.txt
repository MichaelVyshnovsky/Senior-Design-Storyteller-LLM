'''Jelzar's Stride''' was a cobblestone avenue

==Location==
Up to the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], this road stretched from northeast to southwest, extending off of [[Seaeye's March]] and terminating at [[the Lions]].As shown on the 4th map of ''[[City System]]''.

By [[1368 DR]], Jelzar's Stride had its cobblestone street extended, overtaking where the Lions once stood alongside the [[Field of Triumph]], making it terminate at [[Julthoon Street]]. Along the way it was met from the east by [[Dob's Loss]] and [[Gulzindar Street]].

==Notable Locations==
* The Field of Triumph, a large outdoor stadium, had northern and eastern walls that spanned the entirety of Jelzar's Stride.
* The [[House of Heroes]], a temple of [[Tempus]] that stood on the street's corner with the Lions.
