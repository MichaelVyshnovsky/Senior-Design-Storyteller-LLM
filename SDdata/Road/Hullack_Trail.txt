The Hullack Trail was a trail running through southeastern Cormyr.
Following the shores of the Thunder River, Wyvernwater, and the Wyvernflow, it linked Thunderstone, Hultail, Juniril, and Wheloon, as well as the Unknown Shrine, via short connecting trails.
The petitioners and adventurers duped at the Temple of Mystra in Wheloon in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR were told to cross the Hullack Trail and go overland to the Unknown Shrine, but they could choose to travel along the trail and go around.
