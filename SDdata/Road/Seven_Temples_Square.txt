'''Seven Temples Square''', formerly known as '''Five Temples Square''', was a lopsided courtyard in the [[Myth Nantar/Trade Quarter|Trade Quarter]] of [[Myth Nantar]], an [[aquatic elf]] city beneath the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==History==
In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a number of [[merfolk]] and [[locathah]] pitched camps around this courtyard, waiting for more of Myth Nantar's housing to be restored after the devastation wrought by the [[Twelfth Ser√¥s War]].

By the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], two additional temples had been constructed in the courtyard and thus necessitated a change in name to Seven Temples Square.

==Notable Locations==
The namesake of Seven Temples Square was the seven temples that surrounded it, all of which were founded by immigrant races so that they would have a place of worship for their people's [[deity]], and was a holy ground to them all. These temples were as follows:
* [[The Dukar's Hand]], a temple dedicated to [[Azuth]].
* '''The Emerald Grove''', a temple dedicated to [[Eldath]]
* '''Descantor''', a temple dedicated to [[Milil]].
* [[Hall of Living Memory]].
* [[Scrivener's Harbor]], a temple dedicated to [[Oghma]].
* '''Sevesheltor''', a temple dedicated to [[Mystra]].
