The Iron Way was a street in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
The Iron Way ran north&ndashsouth, beginning and ending at Suldroon Street and Erethorns Ride. As one approached the midpoint of the street, it split into two lanes that formed a large circular road that surrounded High Khôltar, the imposing black stone fortress that was the residence of the Belarkh (ruling lord) of the Iron City. At either end of the Iron Way, and running along the two terminus streets in both directions, were the klathlaaedin (ornately sculpted mansions) of various Onsruur (council of lords) families.
