        "mainbody": "he Stone Trail was a rough dirt road that ran eastâ€”west through a stretch of the Dessarin Valley. The dwarven landmark of Stone Bridge allowed for passageway along the road over the River Dessarin.\nThe road connected the settlement of Westbridge, fittingly enough on the west end of the road, to Beliard, on the eastern side."
