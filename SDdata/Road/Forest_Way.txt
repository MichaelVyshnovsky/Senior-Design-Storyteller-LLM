The '''Forest Way''' was a [[magic]]al pathway that could be opened up within the [[Chondalwood]] forest.<ref name=Sent-p188">{{cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|188}}

==Geography==
The Forest Way was the quickest route from the [[Vilhon Wilds]] to the [[Underchasm]].<ref name=Sent-p187">{{cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|187}}

Taking the path through the Chondalwood, rather than going around it, shaved dozens of leagues off a journey through the region.<ref name=Sent-p190">{{cite book/The Sentinel/Hardcover|190}}

==Description==
The path was not readily accessible at all times, but could be opened by [[magic]]al means. Opening the Forest Way required [[verbal component]]s spoken in [[Elvish]], and some unknown [[material component]].<ref name=Sent-p187" />

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, the Forest Way was opened by [[Theamont]], one of the children of the forest, in order to allow passageway for the three [[chosen]] who carried the ''[[Eye of Gruumsh (relic)|Eye of Gruumsh]]'' to [[Sadrach's Spire]].<ref name=Sent-p187" /><ref name=Sent-p188" />
