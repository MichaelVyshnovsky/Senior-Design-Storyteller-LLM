The Forest Way was a magical pathway that could be opened up within the Chondalwood forest.
The Forest Way was the quickest route from the Vilhon Wilds to the Underchasm.
Taking the path through the Chondalwood, rather than going around it, shaved dozens of leagues off a journey through the region.
The path was not readily accessible at all times, but could be opened by magical means. Opening the Forest Way required verbal components spoken in Elvish, and some unknown material component.
In the , the Forest Way was opened by Theamont, one of the children of the forest, in order to allow passageway for the three chosen who carried the Eye of Gruumsh to Sadrachs Spire.
