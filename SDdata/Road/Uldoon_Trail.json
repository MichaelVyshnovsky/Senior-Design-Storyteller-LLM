        "mainbody": "The '''Uldoon Trail''' was a road running through the [[Greenfields (Western Heartlands)|Greenfields]] of the [[Sword Coast]] and [[Western Heartlands]]. It stretched eastward from [[Nashkel]], through [[Greenest]] and [[Berdusk]], before culminating in [[Asbravn]].",
        "Description": "The Uldoon Trail was the most direct connection between the roads heading east and the [[Coast Way]] running south, which made it a popular caravan route.\n\nBy [[1489 DR]], Greenest was the only sizable town along the Uldoon Trail.",
        "History": "The Trail was named after the evil [[wizard]] [[Uldoon]], who ruled the realm of [[Torsil]] in the lands between the [[Wood of Sharp Teeth]] and the [[Cloud Peaks]] around the 4{{th}} century [[DR]]. Uldoon was eventually slain by an unnamed [[paladin]] wielding the holy sword ''[[Dornavver]]'', a tale recounted in the popular ballad \"[[Uldoon's Doom]]\".''[[Champions of Valor]]'' does not explicitly state the Uldoon Trail is named after Uldoon. However, since Uldoon's realm was situated in the same exact area as the Trail, this article assumes it is the case.",
