Great Rift
The Dust Road, also known as the Road of Dust, was a commercial road running through Southeast Faerûn and East Faerûn.
In the 14 century DR, the Road of Dust linked the Great Rift, Unther and Mulhorand. From south to northeast, it linked Eartheart and Delzimmer, Hardcastle, Unthalass, Gheldaneth, Neldorild and Skuld.
With the dissolution of Mulhorand  and the destruction of Unther and the Great Rift after the Spellplague of 1385 DR, the Dust Road became part of the new nations of East Rift, Tymanther and High Imaskar.
The road was rebuilt by the Tymantherans
With the restoration of Mulhorand after the Second Sundering, in 1487 DR, the Dust Road served as the link between the southern dwarven cities, Tymanther and Mulhorand.
The Dust Road was specially dangerous near the Black Ash Plain, as ash giants were known to frequently attack caravans.
