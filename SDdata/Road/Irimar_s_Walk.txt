==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], over the course of a [[tenday]] and more, streets across the Trades Ward experienced a number of [[ghost]]ly sightings. On Irimar's Walk in particular, Waterdhavians reported the apparitions of a woman being chased down the street by [[ogre]]s waving [[sword]]s about.{{Cite web/Waterdeep News/Ghost Sightings}}

These sightings left many citizens, scribes, and members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] confused and some speculated if a [[wizard]] experimenting with [[illusion]]s may have been the cause.

A small number of retired [[adventurer]]s lived along this street.<ref>
