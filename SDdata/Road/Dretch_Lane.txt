Dretch Lane was a short, inclined road paved in dirt and gravel, in the Castle Ward of the city of Waterdeep.
This road stretched north off of Lackpurse Lane, running up the inclines produced by Mount Waterdeep, and terminating at a block of buildings. Along the way it acted as the western terminus of Rainrun Street and Soothsayers Way, though around the early 14 century DR a building was constructed that cut off access to Rainrun Street, leaving the remaining street connected to Dretch Lane to be known as Knifes Edge.
This road was named for a strange and briefly famous incident that occured on it&mdasha wagon bound for some nobles villa got overturned and unleashed its hidden cargo, nine imprisoned dretches. Fighting ensued soon afterwards, with several citizens getting involved.
* Around 1368 DR, a guildhall was being built along this lane for the Loyal Order of Street Laborers, featuring adjoining warehouses for the storage of stone.
