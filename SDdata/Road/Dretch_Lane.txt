'''Dretch Lane''' was a short, inclined road paved in dirt and gravel, in the [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]] of the city of [[Waterdeep]].

==Location==
This road stretched north off of [[Lackpurse Lane]], running up the inclines produced by [[Mount Waterdeep]], and terminating at a block of buildings. Along the way it acted as the western terminus of [[Rainrun Street]] and [[Soothsayer's Way]], though around the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]] a building was constructed that cut off access to Rainrun Street, leaving the remaining street connected to Dretch Lane to be known as [[Knife's Edge]].

==History==
This road was named for a strange and briefly famous incident that occured on it&mdash;a [[wagon]] bound for some [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble]]'s villa got overturned and unleashed its hidden cargo, nine imprisoned [[dretch]]es. Fighting ensued soon afterwards, with several citizens getting involved.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2012)/Dretch Lane}}

==Notable Locations==
* Around [[1368 DR]], a guildhall was being built along this lane for the [[Loyal Order of Street Laborer]]s, featuring adjoining warehouses for the storage of stone.<ref>
