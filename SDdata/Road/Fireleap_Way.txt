'''Fireleap Way''' was a long and straight street in [[Ravens Bluff]] that crossed the city almost completely, from east to west, beginning in the [[Ravens Bluff/Foreign District|Foreign District]] and ending in the [[Ravens Bluff/Tentowers|Tentowers]] neighborhood.

==Geography==
Fireleap Way's western end was located in the Foreign District, by the [[Coker Wharf Company]]'s docks. From there the street ran east, turning into [[Daren's Ring]] circle with the [[Ring Park]] in the middle, turning back into a straight line just before the gate out of the Foreign District. Next, Fireleap Way passed the moot with [[Westwall Way North]] and [[Fire Lane]], further east it crossed [[Raphiel Road]], [[Blacktree Boulevard North]], [[DeVillars Ride]], [[Manycoins Way]], the moot with [[Macintyre Path]] and [[Evensong Ride]], followed by crossings with [[O'Kane Court]], [[Waelstar Way]], and [[Lamorgyr's Ride]]. Then, Fireleap Way crossed [[DeVillars Creek]] via the [[Old Dragonbridge]], and continued on east past [[Torngel's Ride]], [[Stonekeep Concourse]], and finally ended on Bouldergrinder's Way.
