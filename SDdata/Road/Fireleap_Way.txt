Fireleap Way was a long and straight street in Ravens Bluff that crossed the city almost completely, from east to west, beginning in the Foreign District and ending in the Tentowers neighborhood.
Fireleap Ways western end was located in the Foreign District, by the Coker Wharf Companys docks. From there the street ran east, turning into Darens Ring circle with the Ring Park in the middle, turning back into a straight line just before the gate out of the Foreign District. Next, Fireleap Way passed the moot with Westwall Way North and Fire Lane, further east it crossed Raphiel Road, Blacktree Boulevard North, DeVillars Ride, Manycoins Way, the moot with Macintyre Path and Evensong Ride, followed by crossings with OKane Court, Waelstar Way, and Lamorgyrs Ride. Then, Fireleap Way crossed DeVillars Creek via the Old Dragonbridge, and continued on east past Torngels Ride, Stonekeep Concourse, and finally ended on Bouldergrinders Way.
