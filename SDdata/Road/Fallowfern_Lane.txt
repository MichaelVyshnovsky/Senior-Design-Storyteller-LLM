'''Fallowfern Lane''' was an angled southbound street in the walled town of [[Mosstone]] that stood along the [[Trade Way]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Geography==
[[Sairnor Street]] merged with the southern end of the Fallowfern Lane at a steep angle, forming the distinct address where [[Taluth's Shrewd Flight]], an archery store, could be found. Another location of some note that stood on the crossing of the two streets was a forgettable hot-bun shop.
