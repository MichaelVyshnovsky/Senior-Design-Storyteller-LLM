Blackmul Street was a hard-packed dirt and gravel paved alleyway in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.
This alley ran in a straight line from north to south, running north off of Telshambras Street and terminating on Shoor Street. It was situated along blocks of buildings between Beacon Street and the High Road.
Quite a number of retired adventurers lived in the block of buildings between Beacon Street and Blackmul Street.
