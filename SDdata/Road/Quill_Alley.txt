'''Quill Alley''' was an alley in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] that had developed into a street by the mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
This road ran from northeast to southwest. Opening off of [[Wall Way]], it passed through both [[Nethpranter's Street]] and the [[Wide Way]], until finally terminating at [[Spoils Alley]].

==Notable Locations==
Most of the buildings that lined this street were rather rickety, old, and featured winding staircases.
;Warehouse: A warehouse stood on one of the corners of where Quill Alley met the Wide Way. By [[1368 DR]], this warehouse was abandoned and its cellar was being used as a hidden temple to [[Loviatar]].<ref>
;[[The Zoarstar]]: Guildhall of the [[Scriveners', Scribes', & Clerks' Guild]], which stood on the northwest corner of where Quill Alley intersected with the Wide Way.

==Notable Inhabitants==
Quill Alley was so named after the [[pen]], as it was the traditional neighborhood of cartographers, clerks, and scribes. Many of whom could be hired.

During the day time, children often played around the staircases of this street's old buildings, while at night [[thieves]] were likely to lurk beneath them.

==Rumors & Legends==
Around [[1368 DR]], rumors circulated that an indelible [[ink]]stain on the eastern ends of Quill Alley was rising up from the ground and spelling out messages of doom upon the exterior walls of the [[Old Guildhall]].
