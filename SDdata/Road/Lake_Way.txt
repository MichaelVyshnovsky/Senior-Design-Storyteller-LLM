The Lake Way was a major highway in Amn that formed the route between Crimmor and Amnwater.
The road was built along the wide eastâ€“west ridgeline that rose above Lake Weng and Minsor Vale. It ran mostly parallel to the South Fork, and passed north of the Seventeen Sentries standing stones that lay between the two roads.
