The '''Lake Way''' was a major highway in [[Amn]] that formed the route between [[Crimmor]] and [[Amnwater]].

==Geography==
The road was built along the wide eastâ€“west ridgeline that rose above [[Lake Weng]] and [[Minsor Vale]]. It ran mostly parallel to the [[South Fork]], and passed north of the [[Seventeen Sentries]] [[standing stone]]s that lay between the two roads.
