It then turned north between Captains' Close on the east side and the [[Ruins of Illusk]] on the west before ending at the city market. The road continued eastward as [[Setting Sun Street]].",

Whenever Luskan mustered for war, Aldever's Street was the site of soldiers marching in formation as they made their way to the temple for mandatory prayers to [[Tempus]].",
