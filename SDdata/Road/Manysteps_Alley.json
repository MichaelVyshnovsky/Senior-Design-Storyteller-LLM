        "mainbody": "Manysteps Alley was a minor avenue of hard-packed earth and gravel in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.\nThis road ran from north to south, standing between and running parallel to both Zastrow and the Way of the Dragon.\nThis alleyway was home to a variety of soothsayers, shady moneylenders, message runners, and thieves. It was generally avoided by those who displayed their wealth."
