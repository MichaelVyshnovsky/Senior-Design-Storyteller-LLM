On its eastern end, right before it headed west, Quaff Alley was a terminus of Atkiss Alley.\nOn the west front of Quaff Alleys dead-end, there stood an entrance to a junction room of the sewers of Waterdeep.\nThis alleyways namesake was its frequent use by drunkards, who would drink in Quaff Alley until they passed out and then spent the night in it. During the winter season, members of the City Watch would lay straw down in the alleyway, ensuring that any drunkards who fell asleep in the alleyway would not freeze to death. Additionally, there were many cases of adventurers or thieves using the straw as a hiding place."
