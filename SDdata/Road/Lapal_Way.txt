The '''Lapal Way''' was a road that ran through [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the 14th century [[DR]], broadly following the coast of the [[Shining Sea]]. It was a vital road for the realm.

From west to east, it linked [[Sammaresh]], [[Malaxer]], [[Abreon]], [[Uzurr]], [[Lhazantal]], [[Zashuma]], [[Ithmong (Lapaliiya)|Ithmong]], [[Mierskar]], [[Lushpool]], and [[Sheirlantar]].

Before Shierlantar, the road crossed the [[River Talar]] at the '''Mouth of Istishia''', a natural arch used as a bridge. Named for the [[Istishia|goddess]], it was wide enough for three carts to cross at the same time. Small towers stood at each end, garrisoned with well-armed soldiers to guarantee safe passage.
