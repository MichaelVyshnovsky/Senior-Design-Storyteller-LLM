North Way was a main thoroughfare in the city of Khôltar in south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
North Way was three times as wide as a typical street in Khôltar and paved with cobblestones. It connected the south gate (named Farrgaunlar) to the north gate (named Handrornlar) and was one leg of the triangle of roads connecting all three city gates. North Way intersected with Hael Way at Farrgaunlar, and with Orntathtar Way at Handrornlar.
Raelrurs Run began at North Way between Darvoros Plates and Pauntraal heading east to the wall. North of Pauntraal and Baharrokhbrur were several greatfists (large towers) and then older, well-used buildings housing businesses such as forges and foundries, curio shops, second-hand and salvage stores, repair shops, coster offices, etc. These buildings tended to change ownership often. North Way was festooned with more shop signs and shingles than any other street in the Iron City.
Many smaller streets and alleys branched off of North Way, but the two largest or most important were Erethorns Ride and Suldroon Street.
The last real street before reaching Handrornlar was Malpeir Lane, to the east. Between Malpeir Lane and the gate was a barrelworks, a "find it for a copper" locator and guide service, and employment agencies that tried to match skilled workers with possible employers. Then came Harhallos Warmhearth House, Oraundro Nempeths, Munsrums Ready Ladle, and finally, Turthtraal. On the blunted point of the intersection between North Way and Orntathtar Way were, east to west, Jamrados Thanetalium, Surlpars Stews, and Harmeirlarkos Journeys.
All along the North Way, behind the businesses and shops on the east side and accessed by side streets, were dozens of fists and greatfists that were built to give the owners a view across the Great Rift once considered prime real estate, not only for the view but for the relative safety&mdashthe narrow strip of land between the wall and the Rift did not allow large hordes to gather and try to scale or breach the walls.
This street was named simply for the compass direction.
