The '''River Road''' was located in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
This road encircled Huzuz from the north. It approached Huzuz from the east and ran between the city and [[Al-Sarif River]], meeting the [[South Road (Zakhara)|South Road]] on both the east and west side of the city. The River Road was used heavily by caravans bound for the [[Dihl al-Taif|Ghost's Route]],  as well as merchants unloading their cargo from the [[Trade Harbor]]. The River Road entered Huzuz from the north side where it ran to the [[Grand Bazaar]] in the [[Merchants' District]].
