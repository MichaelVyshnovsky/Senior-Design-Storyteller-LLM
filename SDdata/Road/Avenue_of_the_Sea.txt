The Avenue of the Sea, or the Fishers Road, was located in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
The Avenue of the Sea entered Huzuz through a gate in the northwest corner of the city where it branched from the River Road, travelling southeast between the Merchants District and Northwest District before terminating at the Grand Bazaar. As the name implied, this was a popular road for fishermen to use in order to bring their fresh catches to the great market.
