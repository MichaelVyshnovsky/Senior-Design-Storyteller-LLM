The Eastern Wet was the sister road of the Western Wet, both located in the Baldurs Gate/Lower City of Baldurs Gate.
The Eastern Wet began where two boatbuilding drydocks stood, just to the east from the Counting House overlooking the Gray Harbor. It ran alongside the citys docks, touching Stormshore Street, encircling Athcaulyrs Stand, and culminated at Waendels Wharf.
