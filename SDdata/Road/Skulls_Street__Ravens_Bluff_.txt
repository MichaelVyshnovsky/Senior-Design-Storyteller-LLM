Skulls Street was a long avenue in the city of Ravens Bluff, stretching from the Temple District in the south to the Uptown District in the north.
The ends of Skulls Street could be found along the length of Westwall Way South, in the Gowntown neighborhood of Temple District, a block down from the entrance to the Foreign District. The other terminus for Skulls was at the eastern end of Lamorgyrs Ride, in the Tentowers neighborhood of Uptown, where the two roads formed a corner.

In ascending order, from south to north, these roads were Raphiel Road, Blacktree Boulevard North, DeVillars Ride, Manycoins Way, Moorland Ride, MacIntyre Path, Evensong Ride and OKane Court at the same junction, and finally Waelstar Way.
