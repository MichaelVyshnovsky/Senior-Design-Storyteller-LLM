'''Thundar's Ride''' was a moderately traveled trade road that crossed the [[Western Heartlands]] in [[west Faer√ªn]]. It branched southwest off of the [[Trade Way]] just south of [[Boareskyr Bridge]] and cut across the [[Fields of the Dead]], meeting [[Skuldask Road]] at the village of [[Tempus's Tears]]. It continued southwest and became lest rustic as it approached the [[Coast Way]]. It merged with the Coast Way a few miles north of [[Baldur's Gate]].
