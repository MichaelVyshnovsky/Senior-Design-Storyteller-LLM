Gateguard Road was a large city street in Tilverton.
Gateguard Road went on a twisting, irregular course through the Old Town of Tilverton. The northern end came off of Knights Ride near the Cormyr Stairs, and went south around the grounds of Tilvers Palace past the Tower of Wits and Work, Temple of Gond Wondermaker, and the Windlords Rest (later Jonstyls Banner). It curved east along the southern edge of the city, passing by a side lane that held Undreir Facilitations and the newer location of the Windlords Rest, before passing through the Upper City Gate and down a more gentle slope of the citys knoll that didnt require stairs. It finally terminated at an intersection with the Street of the Sorceress in southern Tilverton.
