The '''Tethir Road''' was a trade road in the [[Lands of Intrigue]] that was one of the oldest structures in [[Tethyr]] and [[Amn]]. The road connected [[Murann]] to [[Ormath]].

==History==
It was built by King [[Dalagar]] "Longwalker" of [[Andlath]] from [[230 DR]] to [[239 DR]] to expand trade south of his kingdom.

From the [[1090 DR|Year of Slaughter, 1090 DR]], this road also acted as a border between Amn and Tethyr.
