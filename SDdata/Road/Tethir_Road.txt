The Tethir Road was a trade road in the Lands of Intrigue that was one of the oldest structures in Tethyr and Amn. The road connected Murann to Ormath.
It was built by King Dalagar "Longwalker" of Andlath from 230 DR to 239 DR to expand trade south of his kingdom.
From the Year of Slaughter, 1090 DR, this road also acted as a border between Amn and Tethyr.
