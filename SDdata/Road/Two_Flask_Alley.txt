Two Flask Alley, which was also called Twoflask Alley, was a small dangerous backalley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.
Two Flask Alley was located in Waterdeeps Dock Ward. The alley branched west off of Bitter Alley, encircling some buildings south of Fish Street to connect with Presper Street to the south.
Horizons Sails was located on Two Flask Alley, as was the back entrance to the Thirsty Sailor.
The alley was plagued by cutthroats, thieves, and ladies of the night.
The alley was named as a joke, suggesting that one needed to drink two flasks of wine before having the courage to walk down it.
