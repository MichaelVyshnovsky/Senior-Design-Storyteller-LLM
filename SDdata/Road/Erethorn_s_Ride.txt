Erethorns Ride was a major street in the city of Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
The Ride ran east-west across the entire city, stopping only when it reached the huge defensive walls that surrounded Khôltar and the nameless lane that connected all the guard towers. Like nearly all streets in the Iron City, it was paved with cobblestones.
Starting at the west end and heading east, it crossed Orntathtar Way, which ran in a southwest-northeast direction, forming a large angular intersection with that triple-wide thoroughfare. Next came the T-intersection with the Iron Way which led north to High Khôltar and beyond. The last significant intersection was with the North Way, forming a grand right-angle crossroads before reaching the wall a short stroll to the west.
The area surrounding High Khôltar was known to the locals as "Deepcoin" and it contained most of the klathlaaedin (fancy stone-carved mansions) belonging to the Onsruur (the council of lords). Many of these were located on Erethorns Ride on both sides of the street in proximity with the Iron Way. Farther away from Deepcoin, the architecture changed to the tall towers (called greatfists) of the merely wealthy before becoming business-oriented near the intersections with North way and Orntathtar Way.
