The Road to Enlightenment, or the Enlightened Way, was located in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
The Road to Enlightenment was one of the largest streets in Golden Huzuz. It entered the city for the southwest corner at the Gulf Gate, then traveled directly northeast to the courtyard that housed the Golden Mosque and other mosques to the Enlightened gods. The Enlightened Way served as the main boundary between the South District and Peasants District before entering the Pilgrims District on its approach to the mosques.
