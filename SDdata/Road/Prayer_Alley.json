        "Geography": "[[File:Trollkill Street Sea CS-map.png|thumb|right|270px|''Prayer Alley (left of Heroes' Garden) ''circa'' 1357 DR.'']]\nThe entrance to Prayer Alley was at the eastern end of [[Aureenar Street]] on the southeast side, one door before Aureenar ended at [[Trollkill Street]]. The intrepid explorer [[Volothamp Geddarm]] described Prayer Alley as going around the central buildings of the block and ending up parallel to [[Phastal Street]], In either case, the alley ended in the southwest corner of the courtyard near the only tree on the block, the infamous [[Hanging Tree of Ravencourt]].",
        "History": "Prayer Alley got its name from a time when the area was much more dangerous, and unfortunate victims of thievery had no prayer of escaping the dead-end alleyway.",
        "Notable Locations": "* The [[Hanging Tree of Ravencourt]]: A haunted [[shadowtop]] tree that was known to snatch up perpetrators of capital crimes that had not been caught and sentence them to death by hanging from its branches.\n* [[Whistlewink's Revenge]]: An itinerant [[magic]] shop that occasionally replaced the abandoned warehouse just to the east of the tree."
