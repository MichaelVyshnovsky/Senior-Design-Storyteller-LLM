The '''Dusk Road''' was a moderately traveled trade road in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faer√ªn]]. The Dusk Road started at [[Elturel]] in the [[Fields of the Dead]] near the [[River Chionthar]] and headed northeast, eventually forming a great arc around the [[Reaching Woods]] until it ended at [[Iriaebor]] (also on the north bank of the Chionthar, but much farther upstream) at the west end of [[Trader's Road]]. Along the way, it crossed the east fork of the [[Trade Way]] at [[Triel]], and [[Hill's Edge]] in the [[Sunset Vale]]. and bent south<ref group="note">There is a discrepancy in the maps and description for the location of Corm Orp relative to Hill's Edge. ''[[Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast]]'' says it is southeast of Hill's Edge (see p. 175) and the maps back this up (see p. 187 and page 5 of ''[[The Forgotten Realms Atlas]]'' and the poster map included in the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)]]''). However, the map from the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]'' shows that it is northeast of Hill's Edge. to pass through [[Hluthvar]], then met the [[Uldoon Trail]] at [[Asbravn]], and finally linked with Trader's Road at Iriaebor.
