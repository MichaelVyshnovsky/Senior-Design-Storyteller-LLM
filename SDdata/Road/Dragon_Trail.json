        "mainbody": "The '''Dragon Trail''' was a route in the [[Cormyr/East Reaches|East Reaches]] of [[Cormyr]] connecting the [[Moonsea Ride]] to the town of [[Hillmarch]] and then to the [[East Way]]. It ran along the southern foothills of the [[Gnoll Peaks]].\n\nThe defensive fortification of [[Slingdyke]] overlooked the westernmost point of the trail. As of [[1368 DR]], an inn used to sit at the northeastern point of the trail intersection, across from the fort, but a mysterious royal degree forbade the rebuilding of the place after it burned down. A [[Purple Dragon]] guard station was erected to the east of the ruins.\n\nAcross the trail from the ruined inn were its old paddock and stables&mdash;complete with a horse pond&mdash;which were later used as a free campground for travelers."
