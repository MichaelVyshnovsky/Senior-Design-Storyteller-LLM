Toranths March was a trail found in the Moonsea North region of north Faerûn.
Like most of the roads and trails in the region, with the exception of the Phlan Path, Toranths March was a relatively undeveloped pathway.
The trail began near the city of Phlan, at the Phlan Path, and extended about  north around the eastern edge of the Quivering Forest to Castle Vathar.
