Gondwatch Lane was a small alley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.
Gondwatch Lane was located in the western section of Waterdeeps Sea Ward. The alley ran in between Seawatch Street and the Street of Whispers, running directly passed the House of Inspired Hands.
The latest inventions created within the temple were often tested on the alley, charring its surface from countless explosions.
