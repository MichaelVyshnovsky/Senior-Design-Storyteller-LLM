The '''Street of Seven Altars''' was a street running diagonally, northeast-by-southwest, through the [[Temple District (Athkatla)|Temple District]] in the city of [[Athkatla]]. Like the names of many streets in the temple district, the name "Seven Altars" was a remnant of its noted temples that dated back to before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Geography==
The southwest end of the street connected to [[Aundle's Walk]], at the corner tavern [[Harfin Draether]], before intersecting with [[Godsmoot]] a couple of buildings west. 

==Notable locations==
*[[Crown Aflame|The Crown Aflame]]: A well-known theater.
