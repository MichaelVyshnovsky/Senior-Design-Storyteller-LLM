The apprentice died in the conflagration and several homes, businesses, and villas on Phastal Street were consumed in the blaze as the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] attempted to put out the fire and limit the damage.\n\nEvery full moon since the disaster, a spectral image of a woman looking out a window appeared in the air above Phastal Street, a ghostly remnant of a second-story window in a villa that was destroyed in the fire. The woman and the window appeared to be illuminated by the soft glow of a lantern sitting on the sill. The apparition could only be seen when facing it directly from Phastal Street. It was not visible from the side or the back when viewed from Stormstar's Ride."
