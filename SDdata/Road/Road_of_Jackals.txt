The Road of Jackals was a pass through the Scimitar Spires, known to the ancient Netherese as Humaithira.
The Road was one of two passes that cut through the Scimitar Spires, along with the Gap of Skulls. It was located towards the southern end of the Scimitar Spires, and could shorten a journey past the mountains by at least a hundred miles.
Humaithira served as the location of the Last Stand at Humaithira in , which saw several hundred Netherese soldiers led by Strategor Matick fight against the giants of Thane Bl√≥ta. Though Matick was slain and the pass taken by the giants, the heroic sacrifice allowed a later Netherese army to ultimately defeat the army of giants.
By the 14 century DR, few Bedine had explored the pass, and thus not many could make their way through the Road of Jackals.
At some point around ,The default 2-edition date of 1368 DR is assumed. a number of caravans went missing trying to find another way across the mountains.
