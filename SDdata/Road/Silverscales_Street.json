        "mainbody": "Silverscales Street was a cobbled lakeside street in Suzail. It stretched from The Basin, the citys commercial deepwater harbor, to the edge of Bollivers Wharf.\nThe street was a more or less straight line that began at the buildings constructed on Suzails Basin, immediately crossed the southern end of Neresters Run, and continued southeast, past the end of the Court Close, crossing the Dancing Druid Lane, moving along Bollivers Wharfs eastern shore and ending at the ninety degree turn into another lakeside street.\nThe northern part of Silverscales Street was always decorated with many frames for drying fishing nets. The amount of drying nets was a telltale sigh of how abundant the days catch was.\n*The Black Rat, a small and dingy but pleasant and welcoming inn and eatery nestled on the southern side between Neresters Run and Tholone Lane.\n*Shalibers Ship, a curious ship docked in Bollivers Wharf that served as an inn.\n*Starsails House, the guildhall of Suzails Seafarers Guild."
