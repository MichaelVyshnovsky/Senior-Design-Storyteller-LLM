It led from Easting to Proskur, over the Bridge of Fallen Men into the Storm Horn Mountains, through the hamlet of Old Axe and under Skull Crag then through Eagle Peak before coming to High Horn. It then continued east out of the mountains, going through Tyrluk and Eveningstar (where it connected with the Starwater Road), crossed the Starwater River via a stone bridge and finally ended at the west gate of Arabel."
