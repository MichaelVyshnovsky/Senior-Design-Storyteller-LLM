It led from Easting to [[Proskur]], over the [[Bridge of Fallen Men]] into the [[Storm Horn Mountains]], through the hamlet of [[Old Axe]] and under [[Skull Crag]] then through [[Eagle Peak]] before coming to [[High Horn (hold)|High Horn]]. It then continued east out of the mountains, going through [[Tyrluk]] and [[Eveningstar]] (where it connected with the [[Starwater Road]]), crossed the [[Starwater River]] via a stone bridge and finally ended at the west gate of [[Arabel]]."
