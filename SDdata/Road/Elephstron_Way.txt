Elephstron Way was a road located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid-14 century DR.
Located in the Inner Quarter in central Zhentil Keep, Elephestron Way cut through the middle of the quarter, dividing into northern and southern halves. The road ran west to east, originating at the western gate to the Common Quarter on Wyvern Road and terminating at the eastern wall of the Inner Quarter. Elephstron Way connected with many other roads within the Inner Quarter including the Street of Bones, Imperceptor Street, Raven Street, Flostrens Memory, Wyrms Way, and the Street of the Gods.
Several Zhentilar guardposts were located along Elephstron Way. Other prominent landmarks included the Black Altar, and the estates of Lord Marsh Belwintle and Lord Naerh.
