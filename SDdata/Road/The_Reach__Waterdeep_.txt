The Reach was a small alley located in the city of Waterdeep.
The alley was found in southern Waterdeep within the Castle Ward along the southern base of Mount Waterdeep. The Reach split from the western end of Lackpurse Lane, branching northwest up a steep slope before terminating at a dead end after just several buildings.
Crommors Warehouse was located on the Reach.
The alley was named after the nautical term "reach." Sailors tended to hang out on the Reach looking for a fight.
