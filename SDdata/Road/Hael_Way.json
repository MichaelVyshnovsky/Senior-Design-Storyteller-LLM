        "mainbody": "ael Way was a main thoroughfare in the city of Kh么ltar in south Faer没n, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nHael Way was three times as wide as a typical street in Kh么ltar and paved with cobblestones. It connected the south gate (named Farrgaunlar) to the west gate (named Dubrinlar) and was one leg of the triangle of roads connecting all three city gates. Hael Way intersected with the North Way at Farrgaunlar, and with Orntathtar Way at Dubrinlar.\nThis street was named after Ulbrask Hael who, in the Year of the Bitter Smile, 368 DR, designed a new heavy wagon that was strong, durable, and easily repairable. This invention catapulted the city into prominent status as a major trade center. The final gates of Kh么ltar were constructed during the tenure of Shieldlord Angloam Dubrin (Year of the Alabaster Mounds, 577 DR, to the Year of Orcsfall, 619 DR) so Hael Way was also completed during this period.\nLocations on Hael Way included\n* Anthormbrur Klathlaaedin (sculpted mansion) of the Horthander family.\n* Belphendors Sold pipe fittings and valves.\n* Darrusktraal Duty house and gauthraun (police) barracks for Dubrinlar gate.\n* Elduskryns Fiery Creations A blacksmiths forge.\n* Halamors Sure Service Intra-city delivery service.\n* Harth Trithkeths House of Welcome Opulent inn with a huge beverage menu.\n* Manycoins Hall City-run bank and money exchange.\n* Sesszemurs Fancy luthdren (restaurant) and gambling house.\n* Thalarmols Crates for safe transport of merchandise via caravan.\n* Vandanamers Popular luthdren with fast service."
