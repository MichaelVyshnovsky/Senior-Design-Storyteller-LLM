Vesper Way was a road in the Uptown District of the city of Ravens Bluff.
Vesper Way stretched from Blacktree Boulevard in Torchtown to MacIntyre Path in Sixstar. Some referred to this uppermost portion of the road as Vesper Way North. Between these two roads it was intersected by DeVillars Ride, Manycoins Way, Moorland Ride, and a number of nameless alleys.
* Hogs Head Hall, the guildhall of the Fellowship of Herders and Butcher, stood in the Torchtown portion of Vesper Way on the corner of Manycoins Way.
* Rundelstones Manor, an old decrepit manor that stood at the end of Vesper Way North.
