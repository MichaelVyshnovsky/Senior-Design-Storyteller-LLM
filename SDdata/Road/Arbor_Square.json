        "mainbody": "rbor Square was a large public plaza roughly at the center of Halarahh in the wizard nation of Halruaa.\nArbor Square stood at the center of the loop formed by the Promenade. To the west from it stood the grand Zalathorms Palace and immediately to the south â€“ the Dockside Square.\nThe plaza was a beautiful and spacious square built out of green and pink stone. The plaza was decorated with intricate pink grape vine-shaded iron trellises and arches. Numerous chairs, benches, and small tables were placed all around the Arbor Square, offering passers-by rest in the shade of the hot southern sun. The air around the square was filled with sweet fragrances of grapes, overripe oranges, and savory aromas of the open-air market, mixed with the fresh smell of the Great Sea.\nThe center of the Arbor Square held a stage, a risen platform, used by self-absorbed orators, town criers, and musicians, as well as occasional display of wizardly magic."
