Trollcrook Alley, sometimes misnamed Trollcrush Alley, was a minor avenue of hard-packed earth and gravel in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.
This curving road stretched from southeast to northwest, linking the streets of Zastrow and Snail.
Prior to the 14 century DR this alley was frequented a night for some time by a vicious gang of trolls that had been dwelling in the citys sewers. They managed to slay many citizens before they were finally all hunted down.
By the 14 century DR, this alley was relatively safe and frequently used by carters.
