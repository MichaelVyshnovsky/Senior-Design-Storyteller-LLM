==Geography==
This curving road stretched from southeast to northwest, linking the streets of [[Zastrow Street|Zastrow]] and [[Snail Street|Snail]].

==History==
Prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] this alley was frequented a night for some time by a vicious gang of [[troll]]s that had been dwelling in [[Sewers of Waterdeep|the city's sewers]]. They managed to slay many citizens before they were finally all hunted down.

By the 14{{th}} century DR, this alley was relatively safe and frequently used by carters.
