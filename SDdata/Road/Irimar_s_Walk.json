        "mainbody": "Irimars Walk was a lesser avenue, paved in corduroy-logs, in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.\nIrimars Walk ran south off of Lamp Street, curved southeast towards the City of the Dead, and then eventually turned southwest to terminate on the easternmost portion of Selduth Street. Close to where the street turned westward,\nIn the late 14 century DR, over the course of a tenday and more, streets across the Trades Ward experienced a number of ghostly sightings. On Irimars Walk in particular, Waterdhavians reported the apparitions of a woman being chased down the street by ogres waving swords about.\nThese sightings left many citizens, scribes, and members of the City Watch confused and some speculated if a wizard experimenting with illusions may have been the cause.\nA small number of retired adventurers lived along this street."
