Rogans Sprint was a long road that ran through the Ride in the Moonsea North.
The road originated in the mining town of Whitehorn in the White Peaks, and extended east across the Ride to Verdigris, another mining town in the Dragonspine Mountains.
A stretch of the road ran along the northern banks of Lake Maltorus.
