Soothsayers Way was a secondary avenue in Waterdeep that began in the citys Trades Ward and spanned westward into the Castle Ward.
This road ran in a straight line west from Way of the Dragon, this Trades Ward portion of it being paved in cobblestone. Once it crossed through Snail Street, the road was paved in hard-packed dirt and gravel. As it continued on, Soothsayers Way became the southern terminus of Soldiers Street, the northern terminus of Belnimbras Street, and passed through Cook Street. Finally, the road ended in a dead-end before Castle Waterdeep.
