The '''Srelanat Road''' was a road in the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in [[Malatra]]. It was the main overland route to the [[Kunong River]].<ref group="note">Like many locations in the Kuong Kingdom, the Srelanat Road has not been labelled on any map of Malatra.

It started at the town of [[Srelanat]] on the mouth of the [[Ranu River]] and continued to at least the town of [[Denokanburi]] on the Kunong River.

In the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], travelers preferred the Srelanat Road to the hazardous old roads through the [[Akashnu Mountains]].
