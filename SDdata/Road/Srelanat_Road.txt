The Srelanat Road was a road in the Kuong Kingdom in Malatra. It was the main overland route to the Kunong River.Like many locations in the Kuong Kingdom, the Srelanat Road has not been labelled on any map of Malatra.
It started at the town of Srelanat on the mouth of the Ranu River and continued to at least the town of Denokanburi on the Kunong River.
In the midâ€“14 century DR, travelers preferred the Srelanat Road to the hazardous old roads through the Akashnu Mountains.
