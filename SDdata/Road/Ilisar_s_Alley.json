        "mainbody": "'''Ilisar's Alley''' was a small back alley that was located in the city of [[Waterdeep]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Waterdeep}} It was sometimes miscalled as '''Illimar's Alley''', and its old name was '''Grave Alley'''.",
        "Location": "Ilisar's Alley was located in the northern section of Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Southern Ward|Southern Ward]]. The alley branched south from [[Telshambra's Street]] at the border with the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]], cut west through a neighborhood, then turned north to reconnect with Telshambra's Street.",
        "Notable Locations": "The [[Stone House (Waterdeep)|Stone House]], which was the guild headquarters for the [[Carpenters', Roofers', & Plaisterers' Guild]], was located on the eastern side of Ilisar's Alley where it branched from Telshambra's Street.",
        "History": "Prior to the establishment of ''[[gate]]s'' to the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]] by the [[wizard]] [[Anacaster]] to facilitate travel there, the poorest of Waterdeep's citizens used this alley as a graveyard, hence the original name of Grave Alley. To preserve space, coffins were buried vertically, with one corpse under each flagstone. The practice was eventually abandoned after it led to [[undead]] bursting from beneath the street.\n\nThe alley was renamed for a Waterdhavian [[tailor]] named [[Ilisar]], who became inexplicably wealthy and purchased the whole block. After he died of [[blacktongue fever]], it was rumored that he had hidden or buried his wealth somewhere in one of the buildings on the alley.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "As of the mid-to-late century [[DR]], there were rumors that [[ghoul]]s, [[skeleton]]s, [[wight]]s, and [[zombie]]s left over from the alley's days as a graveyard would still occasionally emerge to haunt the area."
