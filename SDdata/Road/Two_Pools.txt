The '''Two Pools Trail''' was a trail in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faer√ªn]], crossing the [[Trade Way]] at least twice.

==Geography==
The Two Pools trail was accessible from the Trade Way north of Scornubel, and was so named because it crossed two pools, one of which was [[Dowan Pool]]. Traversing it on horseback was doable, while doing so on wagons was impractical.

==History==
[[Thoadrin]] used the Two Pools trail to harry [[Orthil Voldovan]]'s caravan; after ambushing it, he meant to lead them through the trail to Dowan Pool, where he'd restock, and then ambush them two nights afterwards, down the road.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|140|9}} Thoadrin's men were able to make the trip, allowing them to execute the ambush as planned.{{cite book/Hand of Fire/TPB 2002|187|12}}
