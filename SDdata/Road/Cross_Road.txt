The Cross Road ran through the Vast from the city of Tantras at its most southern point to Kurth at its northern point.
From south to north it ran through Tantras, Hlintar, Thindilar, Viperstongue Ford over the River Vesper, through the Viperstongue pass in the Troll Mountains, Blanaer, and ended at Kurth. On the way, it connected with the Coast Road, the Tantras Trail, the Hlintar Ride, Blaerns Trail, the Pass Trail, the Hunt Trail, and the North Road.
In the early days of human settlement of the Vast, bandits fought along the Cross Road around Blanaer.
