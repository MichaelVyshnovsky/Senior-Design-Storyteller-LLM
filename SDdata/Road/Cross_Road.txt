The '''Cross Road''' ran through [[the Vast]] from the city of [[Tantras]] at its most southern point to [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]] at its northern point.

From south to north it ran through: Tantras, [[Hlintar]], [[Thindilar]], [[Viperstongue Ford]] over the [[River Vesper]], through the Viperstongue pass in the [[Troll Mountains (the Vast)|Troll Mountains]], [[Blanaer]], and ended at Kurth. On the way, it connected with the [[Coast Road]], the [[Tantras Trail]], the [[Hlintar Ride]], [[Blaern's Trail]], the [[Pass Trail]], the [[Hunt Trail]], and the [[North Road]].

In the early days of [[human]] settlement of the Vast, bandits fought along the Cross Road around Blanaer.
