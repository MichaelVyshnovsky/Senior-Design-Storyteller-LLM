The Iron Road, also known as the Ironford Trail, was a trail from the Bargewright Inn to Uluvin. After Uluvin, it was a little-traveled trail that turned northeast to follow the Unicorn Run to the Stronghold of the Nine. It was named for the flow of iron ore out of the Forlorn Hills in the days when dwarves were numerous in the region.
The road intersected the Dessarin Road just before reaching Ironford.
