The '''Iron Road''', also known as the '''Ironford Trail''', was a trail from the [[Bargewright Inn]] to [[Uluvin]]. After Uluvin, it was a little-traveled trail that turned northeast to follow the [[Unicorn Run]] to the [[Stronghold of the Nine]]. It was named for the flow of [[iron]] ore out of the [[Forlorn Hills]] in the days when [[dwarves]] were numerous in the region.
