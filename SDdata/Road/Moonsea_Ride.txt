The '''Moonsea Ride''', also called the '''Mountain Ride''' in [[Cormyr]], was a road that ran north-east from [[Arabel]] until it reached [[Hillsfar]] on the southern shores of the [[Moonsea]].<ref>{{Cite web/Map of Faer√ªn}}

==Description==
From Arabel, it ran past [[Castle Crag]] and through [[Gnoll Pass]] in the [[Storm Horns]]. Forces from Castle Crag patrolled the road until [[Gnollpost]], an outpost at the midpoint of Gnoll Pass. From there, it was patrolled by the garrison of [[Halfhap]] till [[Mootpost]], which lay halfway to Tilverton.

At Tilverton, it intersected with the [[North Ride]] before passing over [[Tilver's Gap]] into [[Mistledale]]. It then met with [[Rauthauvyr's Road]] and the [[Standing Stone]] before leaving the [[Dalelands]] behind and cutting through the [[Rimwood]] and [[Midwood]] of [[Cormanthor]]. After emerging from the forest, it carried along till it met [[Hillsfar]] at the shore of the [[Moonsea]].

The [[Stonebolt Trail]] split from the Moonsea Ride in [[Gnoll Pass]] and ran north through the [[Stonelands]], bypassing Halfhap and Tilverton as it met the North Ride at [[Shadow Gap]].
