The Moonsea Ride, also called the Mountain Ride in Cormyr, was a road that ran north-east from Arabel until it reached Hillsfar on the southern shores of the Moonsea.
From Arabel, it ran past Castle Crag and through Gnoll Pass in the Storm Horns. Forces from Castle Crag patrolled the road until Gnollpost, an outpost at the midpoint of Gnoll Pass. From there, it was patrolled by the garrison of Halfhap till Mootpost, which lay halfway to Tilverton.
At Tilverton, it intersected with the North Ride before passing over Tilvers Gap into Mistledale. It then met with Rauthauvyrs Road and the Standing Stone before leaving the Dalelands behind and cutting through the Rimwood and Midwood of Cormanthor. After emerging from the forest, it carried along till it met Hillsfar at the shore of the Moonsea.
The Stonebolt Trail split from the Moonsea Ride in Gnoll Pass and ran north through the Stonelands, bypassing Halfhap and Tilverton as it met the North Ride at Shadow Gap.
