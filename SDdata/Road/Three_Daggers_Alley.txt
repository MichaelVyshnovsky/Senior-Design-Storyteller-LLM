Three Daggers Alley, which was also called Three Thrown Daggers Alley or Thrown Dagger Alley, was a small backalley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.
Three Daggers Alley was located in Waterdeeps Dock Ward. The alley ran between Blackstar Lane in the north and Spiderweb Alley in the south. Dust Alley branched off Three Daggers Alley in two locations on its eastern side.
The Blackstar Inn was located on the west side of Three Daggers Alley where it met Blackstar Lane.
A magical curse plagued the alley, causing a trio of daggers to fly through the air from random locations to attack passersby. The curse was set in place by the mage Arundoom who was stabbed in the back by three daggers by his apprentice.
