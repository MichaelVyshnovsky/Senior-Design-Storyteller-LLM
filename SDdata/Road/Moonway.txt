The '''Moonway''' was a major street in [[Silverymoon]].

==Description==
The Moonway, running north through [[Southbank]] from the [[Mulgate]], divided most of the newer areas of Silverymoon in half east and west. The road crossed [[River Rauvin]] at the [[Moonbridge]] and then continued on until making a T with the [[Ghostwalk (street)|Ghostwalk]] in [[Northbank]] after being joined by [[Brightbuckler Street]]. In total, the street ran for about a fifth of a mile.
