The Moonway was a major street in Silverymoon.
The Moonway, running north through Southbank from the Mulgate, divided most of the newer areas of Silverymoon in half east and west. The road crossed River Rauvin at the Moonbridge and then continued on until making a T with the Ghostwalk in Northbank after being joined by Brightbuckler Street. In total, the street ran for about a fifth of a mile.
