The '''Silk Road '''was the primary overland trade route between [[Faer√ªn]] and [[Kara-Tur]].

==Description==
Beginning in [[Dhaztanar]] in [[Semphar]], and ending in [[Yenching]] in [[Shou Lung]], the Silk Road was the major trade route that connected the eastern lands of Kara-Tur to the western lands of Faerun, and was where most of the goods that traveled between the two areas passed.

Due to its shorter length, and the larger number of villages along it, the Silk Road was more preferred over the northern [[Spice Road]]. The greater amount of civilization meant the roads were better patrolled, and bandits were less of a problem than on the more open northern roads.

The area between Semphar and [[Khazari]], specifically the [[Howling Gap]] area, was the most dangerous part of the trip. It was customary to hire additional guards before passing through this area, only to dismiss them once out of the region.

Locations along the Silk Road included:
* [[Yenching]]
* [[Repo La]]
* [[Alashan]]
* [[Howling Gap]]
* [[Iliphanar]]
* [[Dhaztanar]]
