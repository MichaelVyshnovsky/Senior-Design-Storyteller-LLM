The Street of the Sorceress was a large city street in Tilverton.
The Street of the Sorceress split from the Moonsea Ride and the North Ride at the Tilverton Market, running south through the city and up the Market Stairs past the Rose Altar. In the Old Town it looped tightly around the inner side, passing Knights Ride and Haddock Row, fronting the Grimwalds Revenge inn, and then past Phorns Lane. The route then exited the Old Town at the Tilver Stairs and the Green Altar, intersecting with the end of Gateguard Road and finally looping around entirely back to the Moonsea Ride closer to the eastern city gate.
