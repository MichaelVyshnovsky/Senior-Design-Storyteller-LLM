Firedrake Road was a winding trail that ran between the town of Mosstone and Velen, along the Dragons Neck Peninsula of Tethyr.
The humble road was a trail hardened by ages of moving wheels. All along the trail, one could see numerous small hamlets. Some compared their placements and abundance to pearls on a necklace. One side of the trail overlooked the scenic bay, while the other brushed against the unspoiled woods of the peninsula.
Traveling along Firedrake Road was not the easiest. Parts of the trail passed through dangerous rocky roads where travelers could only use small carts or travel on foot along narrow passages. Further north, the forked part of Firedrake Road was wild and overgrown, and its vegetation hid brigands and human-murdering wild elves.

Firedrake Road stretched along the Firedrake Shores on the southern side of the Dragons Neck Peninsula, running from Mosstone, hugging the waters of Firedrake Bay and continuing north. The first location of note, closest to Mosstone, was the Monastery of St. Domin further along the trail stood the unkempt Black Tomb of the Corsair. Then the trail ran past hamlets of Rock Orchard and Viperstone and ran into the village of Toaketh, where the trail crossed with a road that went north to Murann along ruins of Khalids Wall. Jhaansciim welcomed Firedrake Road to the Dragons Neck Peninsula, forking at the village of Tulmene at the base of the Dragons Head. From there, the road moved along the Heads "maw" â€“ the western shores and ending in the town of Velen. Along the curvature of the "maw," the road passed Carlsmere and the Dragondownrise Ruins located at The Bite. From there, Firedrake Road moved towards Cape Velen, passing several ruins Tharamon, 
Presmer, Dargree, and Manor Atheon. Finally, the road veered along Asavirs Channel, past Blackthorn Manor, ending in Velen.
Despite the relative wilderness of the trail, several locations along Firedrake Road were merchants destinations. Some of the goods that were purchased and transported along the road were apples from Rock Orchard, nets from Valtreth, poisons from Viperstone, and Toaketh knives from Toaketh.
