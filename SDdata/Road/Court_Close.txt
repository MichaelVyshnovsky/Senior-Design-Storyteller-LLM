The Court Close was hook-shaped street in Suzail that connected the Promenade with one of the citys handouts, ending almost reaching the Bollivers Wharf.
The street began on the doors of the Winking Eye that stood on the northern side of the Promenade, one block southeast of Castle Obarskyr. The Court Close then moved north, hooked around the block, crossed the Promenade, and darted south, slightly veering to the west.The description of the street was given in Volos Guide to Cormyr using an earlier map of Suzail. On it, the Court Close looped around the block of the royal stables, that later were moved and the block was built over. For the purposes of the map of Suzail and this article, we are assuming that the streets name and general hook-shape remained the same post-change. The Court Close ended almost reaching public wharves of Suzail â€“ the Bollivers Wharf, coming to a halt at the crossing of Silverscales Street and the Dancing Druid Lane.
