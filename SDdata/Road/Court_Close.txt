The '''Court Close''' was hook-shaped street in [[Suzail]] that connected the [[Promenade (Suzail)|Promenade]] with one of the city's handouts, ending almost reaching the [[Bolliver's Wharf]].

==Description==
The street began on the doors of [[the Winking Eye]] that stood on the northern side of the Promenade, one block southeast of [[Castle Obarskyr]]. The Court Close then moved north, hooked around the block, crossed the Promenade, and darted south, slightly veering to the west.<ref group="note">The description of the street was given in ''[[Volo's Guide to Cormyr]]'' using an earlier map of Suzail. On it, the Court Close looped around the block of the royal stables, that later were moved and the block was built over. For the purposes of the [[Map:Suzail – 15th Century DR|map of Suzail]] and this article, we are assuming that the street's name and general hook-shape remained the same post-change. The Court Close ended almost reaching public wharves of Suzail – the Bolliver's Wharf, coming to a halt at the crossing of [[Silverscales Street]]{{cite web| url = http://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Dec 2004 | accessdate = 13-04-2021| date = 13-04-2021}} and the [[Dancing Druid Lane]].
