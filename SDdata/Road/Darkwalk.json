        "mainbody": "The Darkwalk was a dangerous road in Luskans South Bank.\nThe road took its name from the haunted reputation of the Ruins of Illusk, through which it passed. Furthermore, many of Luskans more notably dangerous alleyways branched off from the Darkwalk.\nThe road turned west from Aldevers Street at Captains Close park and ran through the Ruins of Illusk to end at the Dark Arch bridge to Closeguard Island (and beyond that, to Cutlass Island). \nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Darkwalk served as the boundary between the overgrown and undead haunted parts of the Illusk ruins on its north side and the safe and cleared part of the ruins to its south that had come to serve as burial grounds for rich Luskanites."
