        "mainbody": "Hulkael Street was a short street in the Heapside district of Baldurs Gate, near the citys eastern walls.\nHulkael Street was a much larger street that cut across Heapside, Eastway, and Brampton towards the Fox Bottom moot however, the street became dramatically shortened by the 15 century DR.In Ed Greenwoods Candlkeep post, Hulkael Street bends towards Fox Bottom, however, in later sources, that street became a portion of Stormshore Street. This article functions on the belief that by the late 15 century DR, Hulkael Street was cut short to just stretching between Lathdell and Murls Rest. Hulkael Street began at the strake called Lathdell, near the Shrine of the Suffering, and moved to the Murls Rest strake where Sorcerous Sundries stood."
