        "mainbody": "'''Starmantle Road''' was a road leading out of [[Starmantle]] on the [[Dragon Coast]] in the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "The path extended west from Starmantle, and about a day's ride after, it bent around an exposed spur of rock shaped like the prow of a ship, pointed towards the cliffs.\n\nThe section of forest that it crossed through had [[hiexel]], [[blueleaf]] and old [[phandar]] growths. Notable fauna included [[owlbear]]s and [[stirge]]s. There were also [[deer]], [[fox]]es and [[hare]]s among the known fauna in the area.",
        "History": "The adventuring party known as the [[Frostfire Banner]] was ambushed by [[Saeraede Lyonora|the Slayer]] in the {{yearlinkName|767}}, when they sought to stop it on behalf of High Duke [[Horostos]], not a day away from Starmantle. At that time, the area appeared to be clear of deer, fox, and hare, and the Slayer had already been the alleged reason for the disappearance of a number of travelers using the road, including passing merchants, woodcutters, farmers, livestock, the Duke's men-at-arms, and even a powerful [[cleric]] of [[Tempus]] traveling with a full retinue of warriors."
