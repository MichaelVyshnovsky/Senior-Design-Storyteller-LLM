The Zhentilar Trail was an important roadway for the Zhentilar as it connected Zhentil Keep with the Citadel of the Raven.
The trail branched northwest from Zhentil Keep across the plains before continuing through the Dragonspine Mountains where it joined with the Teshpost Trail before reaching the Citadel of the Raven on the north side of the mountain range.
