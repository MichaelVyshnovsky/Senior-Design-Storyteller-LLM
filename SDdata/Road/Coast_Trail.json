        "mainbody": "he Coast Trail was a alternative to the Trade Way as a means to travel from Calimport to Memnon, avoiding the Calim Desert.\nAs the name suggests, the trail followed the windy coast along the southern and western edges of Calimshan. The path was only wide enough for a single cart and covered rocky terrain, but it was far enough from the effects of Memnons Crackle. The trail was primarily used by adventurers or other vagabonds. Many hermits, smugglers, or other folk who wished to live undetected built structures a mile or so off the path.\nBesides Calimport and Memnon, the town of Teshburl lies along the trail, as does the House of St. Liwans Blessing, a monastery to Ilmater.\nCategoryTrails\nCategoryLocations in Calimshan\nCategoryLocations in the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryLocations in West Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nCategoryLocations on the Trade Way\neb10jh730gkqsant1pvvpz1b88wdb4m"
