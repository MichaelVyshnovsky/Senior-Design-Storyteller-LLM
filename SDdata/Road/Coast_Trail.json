The path was only wide enough for a single cart and covered rocky terrain, but it was far enough from the effects of [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon's Crackle]]. The trail was primarily used by adventurers or other vagabonds. Many hermits, smugglers, or other folk who wished to live undetected built structures a mile or so off the path.<ref name=EotSS-p80/>\n\nBesides Calimport and Memnon, the town of [[Teshburl]] lies along the trail,<ref name=EotSS-p80/> as does the [[House of St. Liwan's Blessing]], a monastery to [[Ilmater]].<ref name=EotSS-p97>",
