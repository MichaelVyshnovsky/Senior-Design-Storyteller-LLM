        "mainbody": "The South Road was an old, important road built in Amn that connected much of its frontiers.\nThe length and remoteness of the road made it very difficult to upkeep. It was effectively a muddy, rutted trail that picked its way through the often rough and hilly terrain of Amns lightly-populated hinterlands.\nThe South Road ran around the distant eastern and southern borders of Amn, curving hundreds of miles from Eshpurta, through the Tejarn Hills, and around to Eshpurta.\n* Eshpurta, the military capital of the eastern frontier.\n* Trollford, the only safe crossing over the Amstel River.\n* Hillfort Keshla, the easternmost Hillfort in the Tejarn Hills.\n* Hillfort Torbold, the middle Hillfort.\n* Hillfort Ishla, the westernmost Hillfort in the Small Teeth.\n* Citadel of the Banner Raised Anew, a militant temple of Arvoreen.\n* Zinner, a village on the Hyrzashyr.\n* Gambiton, a small village.\n* Kings Arch, an ancient bridge across the River Esmel.\n* Esmeltaran, the inland former capital of Amn.\nThe South Road was built during the Third Age of Calimshan ( to ) to link its distant northern garrisons and outposts across the Ralamnish Ridings, such as the Nine Sentinels. Earlier on, the South Road forked south from the Tejarn Hills into Tethyr to provide a fast direct route from Shoonach, though this section of road disappeared with time.\nThe road continued to be used through the 14 century by merchants and the Council Army, passing through the fallen realms of Meiritin and Cortryn that were absorbed into Amn."
