Helhavryns Walk was a road that crossed the entirety of the Shutters neighborhood in the Crows End District of Ravens Bluff from north to south, and ended in the Pumpside neighborhood.
Helhavryns Walk was only five city blocks in length. It began at Karen Court in the Shutters to the north, moved straight south, crossing Hammerstone Street, Drovers Run, Conant Court, Samarglast Lane, and ended at Stonekeep End on the edge of Pumpside. Helhavryns Walk ran parallel to Landleen Lane to the east and Zeldazar Street to the west.
*House of Whelk, a busy Merchant House on Helhavryns Walk and Samarglast Lane, that produced fish pastes and fishing nets.
*Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility that replaced a smelly junkyard on Zeldazar Street and the western end of Hammerstone Street.
