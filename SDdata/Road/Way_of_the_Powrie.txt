The '''Way of the Powrie''' was a trail that ran though the [[Moonsea North]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}

==Geography==
The road started at the village of [[Ilinvur]] (where it connected to the [[Ilinvur Trail]]), and stretched north over {{SI|100|miles|k|long=yes}}, skirting the eastern edge of [[the Ride]] before it crossed into the [[Tortured Land]]s. The trail ended at the gnoll community of [[Frozen Flindyke]] where a bridge crossed the [[River Pelauvir]], but the way continued northwards along the [[Remorhaz Ride]].
