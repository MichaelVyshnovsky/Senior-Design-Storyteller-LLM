The '''South Road''' was an old, important road built in [[Amn]] that connected much of its frontiers.

==Description==
The length and remoteness of the road made it very difficult to upkeep. It was effectively a muddy, rutted trail that picked its way through the often rough and hilly terrain of Amn's lightly-populated hinterlands.

==Geography==
The South Road ran around the distant eastern and southern borders of Amn, curving hundreds of miles from [[Eshpurta]], through the [[Tejarn Hills]], and around to [[Eshpurta]].

==Notable locations==
* [[Eshpurta]], the military capital of the eastern frontier.
* [[Trollford]], the only safe crossing over the [[Amstel River]].
* [[Hillfort Keshla]], the easternmost Hillfort in the Tejarn Hills.
* [[Hillfort Torbold]], the middle Hillfort.
* [[Hillfort Ishla]], the westernmost Hillfort in the [[Small Teeth]].
* [[Citadel of the Banner Raised Anew]], a militant temple of [[Arvoreen]].
* [[Zinner]], a village on the [[Hyrzashyr]].
* [[Gambiton]], a small village.
* [[King's Arch]], an ancient bridge across the [[River Esmel]].
* [[Esmeltaran]], the inland former capital of Amn.

==History==
The South Road was built during the Third Age of [[Calimshan]] ({{Yearlink|-1900}} to {{Yearlink|-900}}) to link its distant northern garrisons and outposts across the [[Ralamnish Ridings]], such as the [[Nine Sentinels]]. Earlier on, the South Road forked south from the Tejarn Hills into [[Tethyr]] to provide a fast direct route from [[Shoonach]], though this section of road disappeared with time.

The road continued to be used through the 14{{th}} century by merchants and the [[Council Army]], passing through the fallen realms of [[Meiritin]] and [[Cortryn]] that were absorbed into Amn.
