Dathantars Crawl was an alleyway of hard-packed dirt and gravel in the North Ward of Waterdeep.Across the editions this street went unlabeled on maps of Waterdeep. It was only revealed by Ed Greenwood on Twitter on November 14, 2021.
This curving alley ran north off of the Beaconmarch, cut through Selvur Alley, and terminated in a dead-end.
Dathantars Crawl was named for Dathantar, a famous nightsoil wagon operator in the 1200s DR whose wagon was said to "crawl" along the street, as Dathantar often stopped at home to eat and left the stench of the nightsoil in his wagon to linger.
