        "mainbody": "uckpurse Alley was an alleyway of hard-packed dirt and gravel\nThis alleyway came off the easternmost end of Spendthrift Alley, circled around a small block of buildings, then went south and west to the easternmost end of Vellarrs Lane.\nThis alleyway was quite frequented at night by thieves. Some of these thugs were known to use children to trip or snatch goods from those passing through the alley.\n* At the back of the store Thond Glass and Glazing stood a large rain barrel. After the barrels gutter was diverted from it, sometime long before 1363 DR, thugs began to crouch inside of the barrel and watch for passersby through its knotholes."
