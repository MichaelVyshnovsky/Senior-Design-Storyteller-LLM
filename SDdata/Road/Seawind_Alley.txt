'''Seawind Alley''' was an alley in the [[Sea Ward of Waterdeep|Sea Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] notable for the ghostly voices that could be heard within the alley.

==Geography==
The alley ran from the south side of the [[Street of Lances]] into the city block between [[Westwall Street]] and the [[Street of the Singing Dolphin]].

==History==
Around [[1267 DR]], the alley led to an inn known as the [[Banshee at Bay (Waterdeep)|Banshee at Bay]]. One night everyone in the establishment was found dead from an unknown disease and many inhabitants of Waterdeep stated the restless spirits of those killed haunt the alleyway.

==Notable Locations==
===Businesses===
* [[Gerin's Breads]]
===Inns and taverns===
*[[Banshee at Bay (Waterdeep)|Banshee at Bay]]

==Inhabitants==
The voices were harmless and usually spoke nothing but nonsensical phrases. The only resident of note was the [[Avolakia]] [[Briarbones]] who lived in [[sewers of Waterdeep|the sewers]] under the alley so he could study the phenomenon of the voices.
