        "mainbody": "The Iron Route was a long-standing trade route found in the Moonsea North region of north Faer√ªn that ran between the cities of Zhentil Keep and Phlan.\nWhile its name suggested otherwise, the Iron Route was little more than a hard-trodden trail.\nMost of the time, Iron Route was considered to be generally safe by locals, at least by Moonsea standards.\nThe road ran across a stretch of the northern shore of the Moonsea lake, spanning the entirety of the Stormy Bay. It lay just south of the Giants Cairn and the untamed steppes of the Grass Sea.\nIn the 1480s DR, the Gray Patriots began carrying out raids beyond their usual targets of rich nobles from Phlan, instead striking against caravans moving along the Iron Route. These raids infringed upon the territory claimed by the Claws of Tiamat, a sect of the reborn Cult of the Dragon that employed kobolds for the acts of robbery they committed on the trade route.\n* Kings Pyre, an  sculpture of a seated king carved into the side of a cliff overlooking the sea.\n* Gilfron Milon, a guide that made his living accompanying caravans to and from Phlan."
