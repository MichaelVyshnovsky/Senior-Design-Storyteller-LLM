Darkhopes Road, formerly known as Peakskirt Trail, was a trail found in eastern Tethyr and the Lake of Steam region of south Faer√ªn. It was rarely ever featured on maps made by northerners.
Darkhopes Road was paved and narrower than the more prominent Golden Road.
The trail originated in Kzelter. It stretched southeast for approximately  before meeting the Tyrants Road at the crossing at the River Mintar.
Mintar was found along Darkhopes Road where the River Mintar emptied into the Lake of Steam. The Narrows Trail branched south from Darkhopes Road northwest of Mintar.
