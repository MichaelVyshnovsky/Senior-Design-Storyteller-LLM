The '''Tesh Trail''' was a roadway in the [[Moonsea]] region originating in [[Dagger Falls]] and continuing on to [[Zhentil Keep]].

==Description==
Though it ran roughly parallel to the [[River Tesh]] for its entirety, the Tesh Trail crossed the river at [[Teshwave]] along its east to west passage through the region.
