'''Dead Man's Walk''' was a trail that traversed the breadth of southern [[Vaasa]],{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} and was thus was a key piece of the northern trade route that ran from [[Damara]] to the [[Moonsea]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}}

==Description==
The road was filled with potholes.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|59}} Travelers had to be cautious of dangerous fauna, notably packs of [[boar]]s and [[wolves]] as well as [[giant wasp]]s and [[giant leech]]es.{{Cite dungeon/53/Steelheart|57}}

During the boggy summer months, the trail became muddy and treacherous. In addition, travelers were beset by putrid smells and the constant buzzing and biting of insects. 

==Geography==
On its western end, the trail originated at [[Avang]] on the Vaasan side of [[Garumn's Climb]], the pass that connected to the lands of the [[Moonsea North]]. Dead Man's Walk meandered north in the shadow of the [[Galena Mountains]] and entered the [[Bottomless Bogs]]. Here the route was laid with wooden logs intended to provide stability for travelers and [[wagon]]s in the summer months when the entire region turned to mud.

Upon reaching the [[Beaumaris River]] near [[Moortown]],While the location of "Deadman Pass" is not specified in the short story ''[[Realms_of_Shadow#Darksword|Darksword]]'', it is implied to be on the eastern side of the Bottomless Bogs. The story describes [[Melegaunt Tanthul]] having entered the Bottomless Bogs via Deadman Pass on his way to the [[Anauroch]]. In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the road then passed through the cliffside community of [[Kond]] before it climbed the southern face of the canyon out of the Clefts, and then continued eastward, skirting the northern edge of the [[Bleak Steppes of Haatar-Baen]], until reaching [[Maur-Eturo]]. A short spur roughly midway along this segment led north to the capital, [[Telos (city)|Telos City]], via a bridge spanning the Clefts of Razack.

From the crossroads at Maur-Eturo, the trail connected to a path leading to [[Darmshall]] across open plains to the east, and to [[Gramble's Climb]] and [[Hulburg]] beyond to the south. Dead Man's Walk itself continued northerly to once again meet up with the Beaumaris at [[Nigel's Ford]] before following the river east. In the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, it travelled along the river's southern bank, while in the late 15{{th}} century DR, it crossed Nigel's Ford to travel along the northern bank, where it passed through the tent city of [[Fugue (settlement)|Fugue]]. Either way, it then arrived in [[Bloodstone Pass]] via the [[Vaasan Gate]].

==History==
In the mid-to-late 13{{th}} century DR, travelers along Dead Man's Walk had to be wary of attacks by [[bog people]] and [[dragonkin]], who took advantage of the dense summer fogs to lay ambushes.

In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, travelers had to be cautions of [[orcs]]&mdash;including from the [[Ring-nose]] clan&mdash;and [[wights]]&mdash;the [[undead]] remains of soldiers who had served [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in the [[Bloodstone Wars]].

==Notable Locations==
* The [[Vaasan Gate]], a fortress at the entrance to Bloodstone Pass, and the eastern anchor of the trail.
* [[Fugue (settlement)|Fugue]], a tent city and refugee camp along the Beaumaris River in the late 15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}}
* [[Nigel's Ford]], a crossing of the Beaumaris that was included in the route as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Maur-Eturo]], a ranching town and crossroad in the [[Sunderland]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}}
* [[Kond]], a trade outpost above the Beaumaris River in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
* [[Moortown]], an oft-ruined town in the Bottomless Bogs just off the trail.
* [[Avang]], a small settlement at the base of Garumn's Climb, and the western anchor of the route.
