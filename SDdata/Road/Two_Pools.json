        "mainbody": "The Two Pools Trail was a trail in the Western Heartlands of Faer√ªn, crossing the Trade Way at least twice.\nThe Two Pools trail was accessible from the Trade Way north of Scornubel, and was so named because it crossed two pools, one of which was Dowan Pool. Traversing it on horseback was doable, while doing so on wagons was impractical.\nThoadrin used the Two Pools trail to harry Orthil Voldovans caravan after ambushing it, he meant to lead them through the trail to Dowan Pool, where hed restock, and then ambush them two nights afterwards, down the road. Thoadrins men were able to make the trip, allowing them to execute the ambush as planned."
