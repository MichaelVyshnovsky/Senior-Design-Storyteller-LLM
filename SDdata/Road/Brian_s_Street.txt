Brians Street was a minor avenue of hard-packed earth and gravel in the Southern Ward of Waterdeep.
This street was named for Brian the Swordmaster, one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep.
This street ran from west to east. At its western end, Brians Street ended at the Way of the Dragon, while at its eastern end the street terminated at the High Road.
The street was met at the south by Mouse Alley, which connected it to Blackcloak Alley.
