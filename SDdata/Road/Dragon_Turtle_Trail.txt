The Dragon Turtle Trail was a small trail found near the Alimir Mountains and Lake of Steam.
The trail was found between the southeastern slopes of the Alimir Mountains and the southwestern shore of the Lake of Steam. It stretched for roughly , connecting the coastal cities of Tulmon in the north and Suldolphor in the south on Talagaths Gauntlet.
In addition to the two settlements, an unnamed trail branched southwest from the Dragon Turtle Trail from Tulmon.
