        "mainbody": "Black Wagon Alley was a small backalley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.\nBlack Wagon Alley was located in Waterdeeps Dock Ward. It originated on Book Street, branching east to terminate at several dead ends in between Book Street and the Way of the Dragon.\nThe houses lining Black Wagon Alley were the homes of destitute citizens of the City of Splendors. As such, thieves lurked in the shadows and often set trip and strangle wires for unsuspecting victims, especially on the eastern end of the alley. City Watch patrols were often busy clearing such traps.\nThe alley was named for a ghostly black plague wagon that was sometimes witnessed moving slowly and silently along the road without a horse or driver. It was said that any who encountered the wagon risked catching cackle fever."
