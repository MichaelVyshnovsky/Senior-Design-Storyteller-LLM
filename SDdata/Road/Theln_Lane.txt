Theln Lane was an alleyway of hard-packed dirt and gravel
This bare, short cut-through passage, ran southwest off of Andamaars Street and terminated on Irimars Walk.
A number of hard-currency girls lived on the upper floors of buildings on this alley. They were known to drop rope ladders down from their balconeys to awaiting clients.
