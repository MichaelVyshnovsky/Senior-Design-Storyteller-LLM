'''Theln Lane''' was an alleyway of hard-packed dirt and [[gravel]]

==Geography==
This bare, short cut-through passage, ran southwest off of [[Andamaar's Street]] and terminated on [[Irimar's Walk]].

==Notable Inhabitants==
A number of hard-currency girls lived on the upper floors of buildings on this alley. They were known to drop [[rope ladder]]s down from their balconeys to awaiting clients.
