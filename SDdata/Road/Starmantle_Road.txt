Starmantle Road was a road leading out of Starmantle on the Dragon Coast in the midâ€“8 century DR.
The path extended west from Starmantle, and about a days ride after, it bent around an exposed spur of rock shaped like the prow of a ship, pointed towards the cliffs.
The section of forest that it crossed through had hiexel, blueleaf and old phandar growths. Notable fauna included owlbears and stirges. There were also deer, foxes and hares among the known fauna in the area.
The adventuring party known as the Frostfire Banner was ambushed by the Slayer in the , when they sought to stop it on behalf of High Duke Horostos, not a day away from Starmantle. At that time, the area appeared to be clear of deer, fox, and hare, and the Slayer had already been the alleged reason for the disappearance of a number of travelers using the road, including passing merchants, woodcutters, farmers, livestock, the Dukes men-at-arms, and even a powerful cleric of Tempus traveling with a full retinue of warriors.
