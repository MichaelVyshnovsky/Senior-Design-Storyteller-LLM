The '''Grand Boulevard''' was a large street in [[Maerimydra]].

==Geography==
Situated in the center of Maerimydra, the Grand Boulevard neatly bisected the city into its northern and southern sections. It was roughly 750 ft (228.6 m) long and 150 ft (45.7 m) wide and flanked at either end by long sweeping staircases that led up to the [[Courtyard of Lolth]] in the west and [[Castle Maerimydra]] in the east.{{cite web |url= http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/frx/20020920|title= City of the Spider Queen Maps|accessdate= |accessmonthday= Sept 18|accessyear= 2014|author= Dennis Kauth|date= 2002-09-20|work= City of the Spider Queen|publisher= WotC }}

==History==
The Grand Boulevard had long been the busiest part of [[Maerimydra]], owing to its central position and the political and religious institutions it connected. However, in [[1372 DR]], during the [[Silence of Lolth]] the armies of [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]] invaded and took over much of the city, including the boulevard. Afterwards, it became a very dangerous place to travel; thanks to its openness, it was very hard to move about unnoticed and frequent patrols and campsites would appear along its length.

==Inhabitants==
For much of Maerimydra's history, the Grand Boulevard was bustling with [[drow]] but after the [[Silence of Lolth]], the street became home to the [[bugbear]]s, [[goblins]], [[fire giant]]s, and [[ogre]]s who had set up campsites along it.
