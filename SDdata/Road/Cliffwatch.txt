The Cliffwatch was a public walkway in the North Ward of Waterdeep that partially spanned the length of the edge of the steep cliff of the same name. The southernmost portion of this road was also referred to as the Watchway.
There were no rails or walls separating this walkway from the steep  drop of the Cliffwatch.
This street stretched from north to south, running parallel to Saerdoun Street and Zendulth Street &mdash as well as meeting the two of them at an intersection &mdash until terminating alongside Malkurs Ride at the Beaconmarch, right before the Watchway Tower.
This walkway provided pedestrians an ample view over the Cliffwatch,
