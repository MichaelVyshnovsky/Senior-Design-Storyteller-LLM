The '''Street of Ser-Ukcal''' was a road in [[Myth Nantar]] leading south from the [[Fire Fountain]] at the city's centre, to the South Gate at its edge, and was the usual point of entry to the city for most visitors. It was paved with white stones, and had many arches overhead, which, as of 1369 DR, made it tricky to negotiate.{{cite book/Sea of Fallen Stars|173}}
