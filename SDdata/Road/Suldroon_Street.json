        "mainbody": "Suldroon Street was a prominent street in Kh么ltar, south Faer没n, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nSuldroon was a major east&ndashwest thoroughfare that ran the full width of the city until it reached the inner walls and the unnamed lane that circumnavigated the town, servicing all the guard towers. It was north of, and parallel to, Erethorns Ride, and intersected both Orntathtar Way and the North Way. Near the middle of its course, the Iron Way formed a T-intersection heading south to High Kh么ltar.\nThe portion of Suldroon near the Iron Way was clustered with the opulently carved klathlaaedin (stone mansions) of the Onsruur (council of lords), but in smaller numbers than at the other end of the Iron Way where it intersected Erethorns Ride. The area surrounding High Kh么ltar was known as \"Deepcoin\" to the locals. Farther out from the center, huge residential towers called \"greatfists\" were the dwellings of successful merchants and socialites."
