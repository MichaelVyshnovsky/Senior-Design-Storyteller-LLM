'''Arbor Square''' was a large public plaza roughly at the center of [[Halarahh]] in the [[wizard]] nation of [[Halruaa]].

==Description==
Arbor Square stood at the center of the loop formed by the [[Promenade (Halarahh)|Promenade]]. To the west from it stood the grand [[Zalathorm's Palace]] and immediately to the south â€“ the [[Dockside Square]].

The plaza was a beautiful and spacious square built out of green and pink stone. The plaza was decorated with intricate pink [[grape]] vine-shaded iron trellises and arches. Numerous chairs, benches, and small tables were placed all around the Arbor Square, offering passers-by rest in the shade of the hot southern sun. The air around the square was filled with sweet fragrances of grapes, overripe [[orange]]s, and savory aromas of the open-air market, mixed with the fresh smell of the [[Great Sea]].

The center of the Arbor Square held a stage, a risen platform, used by self-absorbed orators, town criers, and musicians, as well as occasional display of wizardly magic.
