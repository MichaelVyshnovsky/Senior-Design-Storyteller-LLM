        "mainbody": "The Dusk Road was a moderately traveled trade road in the Western Heartlands of Faer√ªn. The Dusk Road started at Elturel in the Fields of the Dead near the River Chionthar and headed northeast, eventually forming a great arc around the Reaching Woods until it ended at Iriaebor (also on the north bank of the Chionthar, but much farther upstream) at the west end of Traders Road. Along the way, it crossed the east fork of the Trade Way at Triel, and Hills Edge in the Sunset Vale. and bent southThere is a discrepancy in the maps and description for the location of Corm Orp relative to Hills Edge. Volos Guide to the Sword Coast says it is southeast of Hills Edge (see p. 175) and the maps back this up (see p. 187 and page 5 of The Forgotten Realms Atlas and the poster map included in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)). However, the map from the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition shows that it is northeast of Hills Edge. to pass through Hluthvar, then met the Uldoon Trail at Asbravn, and finally linked with Traders Road at Iriaebor."
