'''Deloun Alley''' was an alleyway of hard-packed dirt and [[gravel]] in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
This alleyway was heavily crowded with barrels, crates, and the like.

==Geography==
This alleyway ran due southwest off of the [[Wide Way]], then turned eastward and terminated on a nameless alley. Along the way to that destination, Deloun Alley acted as the western terminus of [[Chelor's Alley]].

==Activities==
During daylight hours, Deloun Alley was most frequently used as a delivery route for the backs of shops. But during the night, the alley became home to both [[rat]]s and [[wererat]]s, acting as an informal meeting place for members of the [[Plague Rats]]. The members of this criminal organization were likely to topple the barrels and crates in the alley, having them fall onto victims or block their escape.

==Notable Locations==
;[[Gentle Rest Stables]]: A stable business that worked in conjunction with the nearby [[Gentle Rest]] tavern.<ref>
