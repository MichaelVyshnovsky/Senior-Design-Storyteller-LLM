        "mainbody": "he Skulkway was a small corner road that was located in the city of Waterdeep.\nThe Skulkway was located in the northwestern section of Waterdeeps Sea Ward. It cut the corner between Westwall Street and the Street of Glances several buildings short of the intersection of the two larger streets.\nA single building occupied the Skulkway. The building was actually an empty shell with holes in the wall large enough to allow carts to pass through. A wizard cast illusions to hide the cart openings. The ruse worked until the entire building vanished one day.\nThe streets name was derived from the fact that it was used to literaly skulk past the City Watch, prompting a stationary watch to be stationed there."
