        "Description": "A single building occupied the Skulkway. The building was actually an empty shell with holes in the wall large enough to allow carts to pass through. A [[wizard]] cast [[illusion]]s to hide the cart openings. The ruse worked until the entire building vanished one day.",
        "History": "The street's name was derived from the fact that it was used to literaly skulk past the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]], prompting a stationary watch to be stationed there."
