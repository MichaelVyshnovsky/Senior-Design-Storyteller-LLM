Manycats Alley was a small back alley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.
Manycats Alley was located in the northern section of Waterdeeps Castle Ward and the western section of the North Ward. The alley ran east to west in between Copper Street and Sul Street. Manycats Alley was also intersected by Shield Street.
Manycats Alley was notable for the presence of a large number of roaming cats, which gave the alley its name, and a wide assortment of carved stone heads that decorated the buildings lining the alley. The carved heads were so life-like that many locals believed them to be the petrified remains of once living people.
