        "mainbody": "The '''Long Road''' was an astonishing thousands-of-miles-long tunnel running through the [[Underdark]] below the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] and much of [[Faerûn]], in use by [[dwarves]] of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Geography": "Its course took it through the Underdark domains of the [[Deep Wastes]], the [[Glimmersea]], [[Darklands]], and [[Great Bhaerynden]].<ref>\n\nIt appeared to start at the dwarven village of [[Glen]] in the [[Dalelands]], where an elevator accessed the \"Deep Mine\", a disguised tunnel to the Underdark. From there the Long Road ran south beneath the Inner Sea. On the way, it linked to several other dwarven communities, such as [[Dwarves' Deep (settlement)|Dwarves' Deep]], and went as far as the great dwarven realm of the [[Great Rift]] in [[south Faerûn]].",
        "Activities": "The Long Road was traveled by dedicated dwarven [[Underdark merchant]]s. In the 1360s DR, the Glen dwarves traded their produce and goods to fellow dwarves along the Long Road, and guarded and patrolled their section well. In return, they received [[mushroom]]s and even live [[dragon]] eggs, which they sold onto visiting dwarves on the surface. The [[human]]s of nearby [[Mistledale]] had only just suspected an Underdark connection by [[1372 DR]].\n\nElsewhere, however, the Long Road was plagued by frequent attacks from [[drow]] and other subterranean creatures."
