        "mainbody": "'''Watch Alley''' was an alley in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Geography": "The alley was a loop inside the northern part of a city block in the northeastern corner of the North Ward, delimited by [[Tower March]] to the north, the [[Trollmarch]] to the east, [[Stallion Street]] to the south, and [[Immar Street]] to the west. The main entry point to Watch Alley was a short passage located on the east end of Tower March, just south of [[Farwatch Tower]]. The southern part of the loop led to [[Black Dog Alley]]. Other access points existed from Immar Street as well.",
        "History": "The alley was a regular assembly point for [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] patrols heading south.\n\nIn the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]], bloody, detached [[human]] feet were occasionally found lying on the ground on the alley. According to [[Elminster]], this heralded a return of the [[Thieves Guild of Waterdeep]] to the city. The Guild was known for employing that punishment as a pun of \"defeating one's opponents\".",
        "Inhabitants": "Like most alleys in the North Ward, Watch Alley was very safe. It was typically frequented by the occasional drunk who wanted to sleep undisturbed. It was considered safe enough for [[lantern guide]]s to cross it alone, as well as for children to play unattended during [[Selûne (moon)|moon]]lit nights."
