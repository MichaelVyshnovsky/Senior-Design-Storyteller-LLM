        "mainbody": "atch Alley was an alley in the North Ward of Waterdeep.\nThe alley was a loop inside the northern part of a city block in the northeastern corner of the North Ward, delimited by Tower March to the north, the Trollmarch to the east, Stallion Street to the south, and Immar Street to the west. The main entry point to Watch Alley was a short passage located on the east end of Tower March, just south of Farwatch Tower. The southern part of the loop led to Black Dog Alley. Other access points existed from Immar Street as well.\nThe alley was a regular assembly point for City Watch patrols heading south.\nIn the midâ€’14 century DR, bloody, detached human feet were occasionally found lying on the ground on the alley. According to Elminster, this heralded a return of the Thieves Guild of Waterdeep to the city. The Guild was known for employing that punishment as a pun of \"defeating ones opponents\".\nLike most alleys in the North Ward, Watch Alley was very safe. It was typically frequented by the occasional drunk who wanted to sleep undisturbed. It was considered safe enough for lantern guides to cross it alone, as well as for children to play unattended during moonlit nights."
