Zeldazar Street was the street that formed the western border of the Pumpside neighborhood in the Southside District of Ravens Bluff.
Zeldazar Street began at the Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility, where it met with Red Sails Way. Unlike the streets that ran parallel to Zeldazar, it did not stretch to the Fire River, being cut short by one city block. From there, Zeldazar ran in a straight line south, crossing Drovers Run, Conant Court, Grismort Lane (which ended at Zeldazar Street), and ended at Stonekeep End, where rooming houses stood at the border with a forested area. Samarglast Lane formed a moot with Zeldazar and Stonekeep End where Zeldazar came to an end.
*Burnharts Outfitting, located where Zeldazar Street and Conant Court met, was a shop that dealt in traveling caravan gear and supplies, run by Frek Burnhart in the late 14 century DR.
*Magestrand Manor, a manse on Zeldazar Street and Samarglast Lane, was home to Oracle, a one-time Minister of Divination of Ravens Bluff.
*Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility, which replaced a smelly junkyard, on Zeldazar Street and the western end of Hammerstone Street.
