Drakar Lane was a small street in Tilverton.
Drakar Lane sat just east of and below the knoll the Old Town of Tilverton was built on, in the midst of the densely built lower city. It was notable for having a winch-powered underground tunnel at its western end that passed up into the hill and connected with the cellar of the Flagon Held High, which was used to transport beer tuns up to the tavern.
