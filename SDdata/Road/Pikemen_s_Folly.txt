'''Pikemen's Folly''', sometimes misnamed as '''Pikeman's Folly''', was a trade route that ran between the city-state of [[Hlondeth]] and the city of [[Ormath]] in the [[Shining Plains]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==History==
Pikemen's Folly was constructed in the {{YearlinkName|125}}, boosting trade between the City of Serpents on the Vilhon Reach's northern shores and the Shining Plains. By the {{YearlinkName|150}}, Pikemen's Folly became a major caravan route, making the city of [[Lheshayl]] the center of commerce in the Shining Plains and Ormath prospered on supplying steeds for the traveling merchants. These [[horse]]s were in high demand and the famous [[Plainsteed]]s of the Shining Plains traveled and could be found in many places along the Pikemen's Folly, from Lheshayl to [[Riatavin]] in the west.
