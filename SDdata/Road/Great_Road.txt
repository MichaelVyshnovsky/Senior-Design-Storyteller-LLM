The '''Great Road''', also referred to by locals as simply '''the Road''', was the single roadway that passed through the length of the [[Great Dale]] and that for many years separated the [[Dunwood]] and the [[Forest of Lethyr]], in the [[Unapproachable East]] region of [[northeast Faerûn]].

==Description==
It originated in the coastal city of [[Uthmere]], along the [[Easting Reach]], and continued east through the entirety of the dale until intersecting with the [[Cold Road]] at the hamlet of [[Kront]].

==Geography==
Traveling the length of the Great Road on foot took approximately 15 to 20 days. The [[Dalestream]] ran parallel with the road for nearly half of this distance. 

==History==
Construction of the Great Road itself was initiated by [[Lord Uthmere]], the first ruler of his namesake city.

The Great Road fell into disuse throughout the 15{{th}} century and was mostly overgrown as of the late 1470s [[DR]].

==Rumors & Legends==
Long before [[human]]s "settled" the region of the Great Dale, a stretch of what would become the Great Road was the primary means of transportation between the [[elves]] of eastern [[Faerûn]] and [[Kara-Tur]]. This was achieved by means of a series of [[magic]]al stones that could open a passageway to the eastern continent twice a year, on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.

During the [[Age of Humanity]] and the [[Era of Upheaval]], this secret was well-protected by the [[druid]]s of the [[Circle of Leth]].

==Notable Locations==
Situated along the Great Road were about a dozen minor clanholds, including Carwyth Hold, Noonym's Hold, and Thy's Hold.

===Landmarks===
* [[Evrelthed's Hill]], a small farmstead situated about a half-day's walk north of the road.
* [[Great Barrow]], a massive burial mound that was rumored to predate the ancient empire of [[Narfell]].

===Settlements===
* [[Kront]], the small crossroads town that hosted visiting traders from neighboring lands, including [[Thesk]], [[Rashemen]], and [[Narfell]].
* [[Mavalgard]], a minor keep and surrounding village founded by the [[Impiltur]]an family of Clan Maval.
* [[Uthmere]], the small coastal city that was wrecked by an earthquake but remained as a small village.
