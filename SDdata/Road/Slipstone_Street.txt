Slipstone Street was a street of corduroy-logs in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.
This street ran southwest off of Wall Way, running roughly parallel to Sleepers Walk, and terminated on the major avenue High Road. Along the way it was intersected by Nethpranters Street and acted as the northwestern terminus of the Wide Way and Sleepers Walk.
In the late 14 century DR, over the course of a tenday and more, streets across the Trades Ward experienced a number of ghostly sightings. On Slipstone Street in particular, Waterdhavians reported seeing the apparitions of a group of axe and sword wielding elves and dwarves, who would race and clash down the street and onward to others until they reached the Court of the White Bull.
These sightings left many citizens, scribes, and members of the City Watch confused. This led to a wide range of speculative theories, each pinning the blame on a wizard.
