'''Slipstone Street''' was a street of corduroy-logs in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Geography==
This street ran southwest off of [[Wall Way]], running roughly parallel to [[Sleepers' Walk]], and terminated on the major avenue [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]]. Along the way it was intersected by [[Nethpranter's Street]] and acted as the northwestern terminus of the [[Wide Way]] and Sleepers' Walk.

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], over the course of a [[tenday]] and more, streets across the Trades Ward experienced a number of [[ghost]]ly sightings. On Slipstone Street in particular, Waterdhavians reported seeing the apparitions of a group of [[axe]] and [[sword]] wielding [[elves]] and [[dwarves]], who would race and clash down the street and onward to others until they reached the [[Court of the White Bull]].{{Cite web/Waterdeep News/Ghost Sightings}}

These sightings left many citizens, scribes, and members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] confused. This led to a wide range of speculative theories, each pinning the blame on a [[wizard]].

==Notable Locations==
