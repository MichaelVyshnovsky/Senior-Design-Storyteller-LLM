        "mainbody": "The '''Hayatura Road'''<ref group=\"note\">The road also appears twice with the spelling \"Hayatoge\". It is not known which spelling is correct. This wiki uses the most common spelling. was a major route through the [[Ikuyu Mountains]] of [[Wa]].",
        "Description": "Because it was the largest and most heavily used trade route for merchants through the mountains traveling between the two coasts of [[Tsukishima]], the Hayatura Road was frequented by bandits hiding in the foothills. The road was thus heavily patrolled and most would not dare to travel on it unescorted.",
        "Geography": "The road began at the city of [[Iiso]] and traveled northwest through the mountains to [[Tifuido]] at the base of [[Mount Fo]] at the [[Sea of Blossoms]].",
        "History": "In [[1357 DR|Wa Year 1775 (1357 DR)]], [[Matasuuri Unteki]], the eccentric&mdash;if not mad&mdash;[[daimyo]] of Iiso, presented a production of the [[noh]] play titled ''[[The Narrow Road to the Sea of Blossoms]]'', which was performed on the Hayatura Road over a period of three days. The daimyo himself played the lead role, and 500 citizens of Iiso were forced to journey along with the actors to be the audience.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "In the prehistorical time of Wa known as the era of [[Kuni]], in the 23{{rd}} year, during the reign of emperor [[Nagazane]]&mdash;estimated to be around {{Yearlink|-600}}&mdash;the legendary [[shugenja]] [[Samon]] was said to have traveled on this road on a religious retreat. About halfway along the road, a great blizzard fell upon the mountains, and Samon was forced to seek shelter. He found a simple peasant's hut and was welcomed within. There he became entranced by the beauty of the peasant's daughter. Rejecting his vows of chastity, he romanced the girl and slept with her three nights in a row, which, by local customs, meant that she was now his wife. On the next morning, he awoke to find that his bride had transformed into coiled snake. He was driven mad with fear and regret at his sin and fled into the mountains, never to be seen alive again.\n\nEvening travelers on the Hayatura Road sometimes still claimed to see his restless spirit haunting the mountain passes."
