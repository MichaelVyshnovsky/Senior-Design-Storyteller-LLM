The [[Fork Road]] was an east-to-west road joining [[Sundabar]] at the western end to [[the Fork]] at the eastern end.

==Description==
Starting at [[Sundabar]], the Fork Road passed by [[Newfort]] just before the road entered the gap between the [[Nether Mountains]] and the [[Rauvin Mountains]]. Five miles before [[the Fork]], where Fork Road met the [[Adbar Road]], down a narrow cart track was the village of [[Deadsnows]]. After the Fork, an unnamed path continued to end at [[Ascore]].

The road was paved but old. By [[1372 DR]], the pavement stones were cracked and had deep ruts, but considering their age, they were in good repair.

==History==
The Fork Road, together with the Adbar Road, was an old [[Dwarf|dwarven]] road dating back to the kingdom of [[Delzoun]].
