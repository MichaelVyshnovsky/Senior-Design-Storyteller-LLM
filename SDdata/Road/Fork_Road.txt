The Fork Road was an east-to-west road joining Sundabar at the western end to the Fork at the eastern end.
Starting at Sundabar, the Fork Road passed by Newfort just before the road entered the gap between the Nether Mountains and the Rauvin Mountains. Five miles before the Fork, where Fork Road met the Adbar Road, down a narrow cart track was the village of Deadsnows. After the Fork, an unnamed path continued to end at Ascore.
The road was paved but old. By 1372 DR, the pavement stones were cracked and had deep ruts, but considering their age, they were in good repair.
The Fork Road, together with the Adbar Road, was an old dwarven road dating back to the kingdom of Delzoun.
