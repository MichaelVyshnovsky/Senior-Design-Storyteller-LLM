'''Torch Street''' was a curved street in the city of [[Suzail]] that ran parallel to [[Blade Lane]], not far from the city's eastern edge.

==Description==
Torch Street began on the crossing of [[Stonebow Street]] and a Y-shaped [[Swordstars Lane]] to the north. From there, the street moved south, past the [[Street of Staves]], and came to an end in front of [[The Lockup]], Suzail's prison.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|65-66}}
