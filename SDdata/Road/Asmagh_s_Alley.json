        "mainbody": "Asmaghs Alley was a backalley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.\n\"Each ward has its own history, legends, and traditions based around who lived there in the past, famous or infamous events, and the uncanny things that continue to occur. For example, children (and even some adults) hop on one foot when crossing Asmaghs Alley in the Castle Ward. Why? Well, Asmagh was an apothecary who poisoned many patients, then buried them upright beneath the alley under cover of night. He was discovered, and some say that as many as eighty bodies were subsequently pulled up from holes under the alleys wide flagstones. Though this happened over a century ago, children passing through the alley still sing a song “Hop for the hollows, hop for the dead, hop on the flagstones, hop on their heads.” As you stroll down Warriors Way or the Street of Silver, listen for the childrens delighted screams and go give it a try.\" -Volos Waterdeep Enchiridion (Waterdeep Dragon Heist)\nAsmaghs Alley was located in the central section of Waterdeeps Castle Ward. The alley ran north to south, originating on Selduth Street and ending in the south on Palfrey Lane. It ran parallel to Warriors Way."
