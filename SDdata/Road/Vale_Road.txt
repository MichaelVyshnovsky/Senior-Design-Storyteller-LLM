The Vale Road was the primary route leading north out of Hulburg on the Moonsea, and connected the city to the farming community of Winterspear Vale and to Thar beyond.
The road originated in Hulburg. It passed through Harmachs Foot, a square in Old Hulburg, on its way north out of town. As it left the city, it turned east rather than cross at the Burned Bridge, the junction with Keldon Way, and remained on the eastern side of the Winterspear River heading north into the farmlands of Winterspear Vale. 
After about , the road passed through a narrow gap in Lendons Dike as it neared Lake Hul. Rounding the lake, the road forked at an old dairy farm, with the road to Glister heading west into Thar and a cart track heading east and north into the Highfells to Garumns Climb through the Galena Mountains to Vaasa.
