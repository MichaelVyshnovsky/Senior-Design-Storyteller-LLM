The '''Street of the Dragon''' was a main thoroughfare in [[Daerlun]], [[Sembia]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. This street ran east-west from the Sunset Gate (the western gate out of the city to the [[Way of the Manticore]]), through the [[Westmarket]] area, and on to the [[Place of Banners]], a large open area in the center of the city that contained the seat of local government, [[Bergun Hall]]. On the north side of the street, not far from the Sunset gate was the luxurious [[Black Banner Inn]].{{Cite dragon/287/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Shadowdark House|70}}
