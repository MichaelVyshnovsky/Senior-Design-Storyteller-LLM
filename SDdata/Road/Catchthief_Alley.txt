Catchthief Alley was a small alley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.
Catchthief Alley was located in the southern section of Waterdeeps North Ward. The alley wound through a courtyard bound by Brahiirs Street to the northwest, Nindabar Street to the east, Gelthoon Street to the west, and Golden Serpent Street to the south. Catchthief Alley connected with all of these roads except Gelthoon Street.
The alley earned its name as it was where the notorious thief Uluryk Malogh met his end. Much of the alley was destroyed during ages past when a wyrm burst through from below.
