'''Catchthief Alley''' was a small alley that was located in the city of [[Waterdeep]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Waterdeep}}

==Location==
Catchthief Alley was located in the southern section of Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]]. The alley wound through a courtyard bound by [[Brahiir's Street]] to the northwest, [[Nindabar Street]] to the east, [[Gelthoon Street]] to the west, and [[Golden Serpent Street]] to the south. Catchthief Alley connected with all of these roads except Gelthoon Street.

==History==
The alley earned its name as it was where the notorious [[thief]] [[Uluryk Malogh]] met his end. Much of the alley was destroyed during ages past when a [[wyrm]] burst through from below.
