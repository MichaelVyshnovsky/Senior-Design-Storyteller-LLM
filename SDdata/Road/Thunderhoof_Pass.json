        "mainbody": "The Thunderhoof Pass was a mountain road through the Sword Mountains connected to the Old Owl Well.\nThe Thunderhoof Pass began in a small wooded area surrounding the settlement of Gnomengarde on the Sword Mountains western side, passed the Ash Ridge, and reached the Old Owl Well.\nBefore the 15 century DR, the Thunderhoof Pass was an important trade way that led to the Old Owl Well. Following the disastrous Spellplague that ravaged the face of Toril, the Thunderhoof Pass and the Old Owl Well were taken over by the orcs of the Many-Arrows Kingdom. Powers of the Lords Alliance showed little interest in the mountain pass as the trade withered away. Despite having little strategic value, Lord Neverember used adventurers to claim the Thunderhoof Pass for Neverwinter, with a promise of grand rewards.\nBefore the orcish occupation, settlements near the Thunderhoof Pass were where the Sword Mountains spice cakes originated from. In the 15 century DR, the Thunderhoof Pass was plagued by orcs of the Many-Arrows and by deathjump spiders."
