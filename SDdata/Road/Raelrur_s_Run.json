Upon entering Farrgaunlar, Darvoros Plates was the first building to the right (east), then came Raelrurs Run, and then Pauntraal, the garthraun (police) headquarters and duty house. Turning down Raelrurs Run, there were guarded warehouses along most of its length until the last building on the left (north) Mother Talaskos.\nLocations on Raelrurs Run included\n* Mother Talaskos A low-class blurdren (food counter) with good stew.\n* Pauntraal The garthraun HQ and guard tower for Farrgaunlar.\n* Darvoros Plates A successful metal plate manufacturer."
