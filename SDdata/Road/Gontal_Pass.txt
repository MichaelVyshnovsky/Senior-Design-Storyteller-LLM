Gontal Pass was the name of a narrow chasm in the mountains of Gontal. It was the only land route that connected the kingdom of Gontal with the Dusk Ports and the rest of Laerakond.
All overland trade between Gontal and the other nations of Laerakond was first organized and administered in Gontal Citys eastern gate. The families of the Twelvefold controlled most of the trade rights to use the Gontal Pass.
