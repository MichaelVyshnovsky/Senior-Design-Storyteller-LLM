            "Geographical Features": "The Reach traversed some of the most unforgiving and harsh landscapes in all of [[Faer没n]]. In the south, even before entering the Great Glacier, the Cinnabar Wastes were cold and arid badlands{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}} and the passes through the Lugsaas Chain were known to be treacherous, especially the labyrinthine Ice Run prior to the 15{{Th}} century. The Glacier itself was a harsh arctic environment throughout both Alpuk and Analpuk, and crossing the regions' rivers was especially dangerous given the risk of falling through the ice and freezing to death. A brief respite from the cold was to be had as it passed through Novularond, which was fairly free of ice thanks to the preternaturally warm [[granite]] of the area, but which was otherwise bleak and barren."
