        "mainbody": "he Reach was a trail that ran from Vaasa through the Great Glacier to Sossal.\nThe Reach originated in Vaasa, where it diverged from the road between Nigels Ford and Palischuk. The trail went west through the Cinnabar Wastes and then north through the Lugsaas Chain mountains via the Ice Run. During the mid-to-late 14 century DR, this was where the trail entered the Great Glacier however, this area was free of the ice as of the late 15 century DR.\nBeyond the Lugsaas Chain, the trail forked. A western path led to Etuabe on the shores of Mirror Lake while the main trail continued north through the giant kingdom of Kultaakarr and passed the Surykyk Range. This was where the route entered the Great Glacier as of the late 15 century.\nThe trail then ran northeast across the frigid and snowy region of Alpuk, necessitating the crossing of the Makkorok Stream, to arrive at the southern spur of Novularond and then traverse those mountains central valley. From the northeast tip of Novularond, the trail continued through the Angalpuk basin, necessitating the crossing of the Forrok Stream, and exited the Great Glacier by crossing the Angsaas Chain to arrive in Uldfest at the base of the Armridge Mountains in Sossal.\nThe Reach traversed some of the most unforgiving and harsh landscapes in all of Faerûn. In the south, even before entering the Great Glacier, the Cinnabar Wastes were cold and arid badlands and the passes through the Lugsaas Chain were known to be treacherous, especially the labyrinthine Ice Run prior to the 15 century. The Glacier itself was a harsh arctic environment throughout both Alpuk and Analpuk, and crossing the regions rivers was especially dangerous given the risk of falling through the ice and freezing to death. A brief respite from the cold was to be had as it passed through Novularond, which was fairly free of ice thanks to the preternaturally warm granite of the area, but which was otherwise bleak and barren.\nCategoryRoads\nCategoryTrails\nCategoryLocations in Vaasa\nCategoryLocations in the Bloodstone Lands\nCategoryLocations in Sossal\nCategoryLocations in the Cold Lands\nCategoryLocations on the Great Glacier\nCategoryLocations in Alpuk\nCategoryLocations in Angalpuk\nCategoryLocations in the Novularond\nCategoryLocations in the Lugsaas Chain\nCategoryLocations in Northeast Faerûn\nCategoryLocations in Faerûn\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nldcpsujx54je12crlmn6hs6vc3ect4q"
