The Old Road was a road in the Vilhon Reach area that ran from Shamph in Chondath, south through the Chondalwood, through Elbulder in Sespech, where it crossed the River Arran, and then further south across the Golden Plains towards Shaar.
The Naga Ford and Roaringford.
At one point long before the 14 century DR, the Old Road was rerouted following the ruination of the "old" Elbulder in a disastrous magical battle. The town was rebuilt further east, and for a long while, the Old Road used the citys wagon-ferry to cross the River Arran. However, by the 14 century DR, two bridges were built across both tributaries of the River Arran to the north and south of "new" Elbulder.
Circa the , strange sightings started plaguing the Old Road. Shamphs inhabitants started witnessing spirits wandering the forest route. The Mayor of Shamph, Tian Redwon, sent out several bands of adventurers to investigate the apparitions in fear of them scaring away merchants, but the hirelings returned empty-handed every time.
