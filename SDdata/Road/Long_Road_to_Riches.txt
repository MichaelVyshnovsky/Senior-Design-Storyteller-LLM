The '''Long Road to Riches''' was a lengthy, circuitous caravan route established by the [[Zhentarim]] that ran from [[Zhentil Keep]] around the southern [[Anauroch]] to the [[Sword Coast]].

==Description==
The route started from [[Zhentil Keep]] and passed west and south through the [[Tesh Valley]], [[Daggerdale]], and around the southern [[Desertsedge]] of [[the Sword]]. It then picked its way through the [[Stonelands]] and the [[Goblin Marches]], before climbing from the [[Tunlands]] into the [[Yellow Snake Pass]] and descending through [[Skull Gorge]]. From there it went northwards across the [[Backlands]] into [[Dawn Pass]] and the [[Grayvale]], and passed down the [[Delimbiyr River]] through [[Llorkh]] and [[Loudwater]] into the Sword Coast proper.

==Defenses==
Soldiers of the [[Zhentilar]] were stationed at various points along the route, with [[Darkhold]] responsible for the region around Yellow Snake Pass.

In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Zhentarim sponsored raids by [[orc]]s and mercenaries around [[Arabel]], keeping the [[Purple Dragons]] on the defensive inside Cormyr and preventing them from launching expeditions into the Stonelands and threatening the caravan route. This plan came under threat by the 1350s DR when [[Tilverton]] was annexed and new waves of settlement reached the Stonelands, extending the reach of Cormyr in the region.
