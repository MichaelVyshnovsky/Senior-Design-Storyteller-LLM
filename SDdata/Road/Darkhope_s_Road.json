It was rarely ever featured on maps made by northerners.\nDarkhopes Road was paved and narrower than the more prominent Golden Road.\nThe trail originated in Kzelter. It stretched southeast for approximately  before meeting the Tyrants Road at the crossing at the River Mintar.\nMintar was found along Darkhopes Road where the River Mintar emptied into the Lake of Steam. The Narrows Trail branched south from Darkhopes Road northwest of Mintar."
