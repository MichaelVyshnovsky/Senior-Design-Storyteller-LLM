The Western Wet was the sister road of the Eastern Wet, both located in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate and encircled the citys wharves and docks on the Gray Harbor.
The Western Wet stretched from the Seatower of Balduran in the Seatower district, passed Black Eel Street and Glaezels Dock, continued on to cross Caundorl Street and Hethkantles Jetty, and ended by the Water Queens House.
