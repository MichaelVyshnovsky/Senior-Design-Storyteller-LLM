        "mainbody": "hank Alley was an alleyway of hard-packed earth and gravelThe map within the 1-edition sourcebook City System misprinted this locations name as Shark Alley.\nJutting off north from Aureenar Street, this alley circled the interior of a triangular city block.\nCrowded by many stacks of crates containing fish, this alley was often visited by birds seeking to feed. Local youths were known to throw sticks and stones at these birds, killing them either to eat themselves or sell to a cook. Visitors skilled with slings were known to do the same.\nPrior to the 14 century DR, this alley was often frequented by thieves who wielded shanks.\nIn the center of this alley stood a manhole opening to a surface shaft of the city sewers."
