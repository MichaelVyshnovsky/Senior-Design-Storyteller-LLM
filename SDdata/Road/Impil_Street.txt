Impil Street was an alley in the town of Wheloon in Cormyr, located near the waterfront on the eastern shore of the Wyvernflow River.
Impil Street was the site of a number of warehouses, all owned by the Cormyrean Coins Coster. They held perishable goods imported by the coster, and were usually well guarded.
Impil Street was a cobbled, dead-end alley with uneven sides. The warehouses were typically 20 feet (6 meters) high, were built of wood, and had strong wooden doors. One was marked by brass plaque as 23 Impil Street.
Following continued efforts to smuggle jewels inside vegetables, operations were shut down in Eleasias of Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, while the Coiners sorted out their legal problems. This left their Impil Street warehouses unoccupied and half-empty. After two weeks, the remaining stock of fruit and vegetables went to waste, and one warehouse was infested by bats.
In early Eleint, the thugs Londal Fen and Smile would potentially use the location to trap and ambush those investigating the local cult of Shar. They would send a message luring the adventurers to 23 Impil Street, where they would drop a net over them and attack. However, the bats would be disturbed and swarm and attack all involved.
