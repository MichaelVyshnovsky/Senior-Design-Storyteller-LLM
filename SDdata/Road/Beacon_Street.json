        "mainbody": "Beacon Street was a hard-packed dirt and gravel paved alleyway in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.\nThis alley ran in a straight line from north to south, situated along blocks of buildings between Blackmul Street and the Way of the Dragon. It stood directly south of Shoor Street, being connected to its western end by a short unnamed alley.\nAn entrance to the sewers of Waterdeep could be found at the midpoint of this alleyway.\nQuite a number of retired adventurers lived in the block of buildings between Beacon Street and Blackmul Street."
