}}'''The Reach''' was a trail that ran from [[Vaasa]] through the [[Great Glacier]] to [[Sossal]].

==Geography==
The Reach originated in Vaasa, where it diverged from the road between [[Nigel's Ford]] and [[Palischuk]]. The trail went west through the [[Cinnabar Wastes]] and then north through the [[Lugsaas Chain]] mountains via the [[Ice Run]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} During the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], this was where the trail entered the Great Glacier; however, this area was free of the ice as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.

Beyond the [[Lugsaas Chain]], the trail forked. A western path led to [[Etuabe]] on the shores of [[Mirror Lake]] while the main trail continued north through the [[giant]] kingdom of [[Kultaakarr]] and passed the [[Surykyk Range]]. This was where the route entered the Great Glacier as of the late 15{{th}} century.

The trail then ran northeast across the frigid and snowy region of [[Alpuk]], necessitating the crossing of the [[Makkorok Stream]], to arrive at the southern spur of [[Novularond]] and then traverse those mountains' central valley. From the northeast tip of Novularond, the trail continued through the [[Angalpuk]] basin, necessitating the crossing of the [[Forrok Stream]], and exited the Great Glacier by crossing the [[Angsaas Chain]] to arrive in [[Uldfest]] at the base of the [[Armridge Mountains]] in Sossal.

===Geographical Features===
The Reach traversed some of the most unforgiving and harsh landscapes in all of [[Faer没n]]. In the south, even before entering the Great Glacier, the Cinnabar Wastes were cold and arid badlands{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|82}} and the passes through the Lugsaas Chain were known to be treacherous, especially the labyrinthine Ice Run prior to the 15{{Th}} century. The Glacier itself was a harsh arctic environment throughout both Alpuk and Analpuk, and crossing the regions' rivers was especially dangerous given the risk of falling through the ice and freezing to death. A brief respite from the cold was to be had as it passed through Novularond, which was fairly free of ice thanks to the preternaturally warm [[granite]] of the area, but which was otherwise bleak and barren.
