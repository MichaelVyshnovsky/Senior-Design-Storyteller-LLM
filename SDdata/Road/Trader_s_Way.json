        "mainbody": "he Traders Way (also seen as the Traders Way) was a caravan road that connected with the Golden Road at Kormul in the Shaar.\nTraveling south from Kormul, it passed by the Wyrmbones and crossed the River Talar. Turning east, it passed through Rethmar and Channathgate before climbing the Landrise and reaching Three Swords, Eartheart, and Delzimmer before turning south to end at Cathyr in Dambrath.\nThe Traders Way skirted the eastern edge of the Forest of Amtar which was a favorite place for bandits to prey on caravans that were not adequately guarded. For those traveling lightly with goods that fit on muleback, guides could be hired in Kh√¥ltar or Delzimmer for escort along this stretch, staying well to the east of the road (and the forest) using the cairns as landmarks.\nThe Traders Way also met the Dunsel Trail at Eartheart.\nThis road was characterized by numerous cairns, pinnacles, and crags that shepherded caravans along the Way. They could be found irregularly spaced all along the eastern side of the road (technically the north side when the road was heading in an east-west direction) and helped travelers navigate when dust storms kicked up. At least three of these cairns or pinnacles, just north and west of Delzimmer, had names Harboots Tooth, the Knife, and Daustables Morrum."
