It originated on [[Belnimbra's Street]] near the intersection with [[Eel Street (Waterdeep)|Eel Street]] and branched south and east, cutting the main intersection with [[Sakiir's Street]] to connect with that road several buildings to the south.",
        "History": "The road derived its name from the icy and slick conditions it experienced during the winter months. When ice combined with the street's steep incline, pedestrians often went for an unplanned ride."
