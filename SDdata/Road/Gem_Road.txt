The Gem Road was a major highway in Amn that served as the main route between Esmeltaran and Keczulla.
The road wound along the shore of Lake Esmel and the bank of the Splendarrllur river for much of its length, and passed near the rumored location of Myth Lharast.
The Gem Road was heavily patrolled by a Council Army garrison based out of Keczulla that also provided escorts for caravans. During the 14 century DR, this detachment was commanded by Colonel Gladdos Wintosnip, who ensured that his soldiers did their duty and werent bought off by rich merchants seeking extra services.
The Gem Road was built as a response to the increasing wealth and prosperity of Keczulla following the discovery of the Tanisloves new gem mines in 1355 DR. It was planned and sponsored by the Council of Six and Lord Pulth Tanislove, and construction began in 1359 DR. Although Pulth died in 1361 DR, his son Pehllus oversaw its completion in 1366 DR.
