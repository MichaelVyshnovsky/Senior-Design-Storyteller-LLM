        "Description": "North Way was three times as wide as a typical street in Khôltar and paved with cobblestones. It connected the south gate (named Farrgaunlar) to the north gate (named Handrornlar) and was one leg of the triangle of roads connecting all three city gates. North Way intersected with [[Hael Way]] at Farrgaunlar, and with [[Orntathtar Way]] at Handrornlar.\n\n[[Raelrur's Run]] began at North Way between [[Darvoro's Plates]] and [[Pauntraal]] heading east to the wall.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|70}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 55: Khôltar, Part 6, Looking Around the Farrgaunlar}} North of Pauntraal and [[Baharrokhbrur]] were several greatfists (large towers) and then older, well-used buildings housing businesses such as forges and foundries, curio shops, second-hand and salvage stores, repair shops, coster offices, ''etc.'' These buildings tended to change ownership often. North Way was festooned with more shop signs and shingles than any other street in the Iron City.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|71-72}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 56: Khôltar, Part 7, Leaving the Farrgaunlar}}\n\nMany smaller streets and alleys branched off of North Way, but the two largest or most important were [[Erethorn's Ride]] and [[Suldroon Street]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|82}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 62 Khôltar, Part 13, High Khôltar}}\n\nThe last real street before reaching Handrornlar was Malpeir Lane, to the east. Between Malpeir Lane and the gate was a barrelworks, a \"find it for a copper\" locator and guide service, and employment agencies that tried to match skilled workers with possible employers. Then came [[Harhallo's Warmhearth House]], [[Oraundro Nempeth's]], [[Munsrum's Ready Ladle]], and finally, [[Turthtraal]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|77}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}} On the blunted point of the intersection between North Way and Orntathtar Way were, east to west, [[Jamrado's Thanetalium]], [[Surlpar's Stews]], and [[Harmeirlarko's Journeys]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|77-79}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 60: Khôltar, Part 11, A Last Look Around Handrornlar}}\n\nAll along the North Way, behind the businesses and shops on the east side and accessed by side streets, were dozens of fists and greatfists that were built to give the owners a view across the [[Great Rift]]; once considered prime real estate, not only for the view but for the relative safety&mdash;the narrow strip of land between the wall and the Rift did not allow large hordes to gather and try to scale or breach the walls.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|72-74}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 57: Khôltar, Part 8, A First Look at Handrornlar}}",
        "History": "This street was named simply for the compass direction.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|85-86}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 65: Khôltar, Part 16, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 3}}",
        "Notable Locations": "Locations on North Way included:\n* [[Baharrokhbrur]]: Klathlaaedin (sculpted mansion) of the [[Khaundrove]] family.\n* [[Darvoro's Plates]]: Sold metal plates and plaques of all types.\n* [[Harhallo's Warmhearth House]]: Old inn for those not wanting to pay for luxury.\n* [[Harmeirlarko's Journeys]]: Wagon repair shop.\n* [[Jamrado's Thanetalium]]: Theater for the (usually ribald) performing arts.\n* [[Munsrum's Ready Ladle]]: Busy, popular blurdren (food counter).\n* [[Oraundro Nempeth's]]: Sold rope, twine, wire, chain, and rings to which they could fasten.\n* [[Pauntraal]]: Duty house and gauthraun (police) barracks for Farrgaunlar.\n* [[Surlpar's Stews]]: Busy, low-cost blurdren.\n* [[Turthtraal]]: Twin duty houses, jail, armory, and garthraun offices at Handrornlar."
