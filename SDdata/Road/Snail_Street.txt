Snail Street was a long, cobblestone paved, road in the city of Waterdeep that began in the Castle Ward and ended in the Dock Ward. Its northernmost portions sat directly on the boundary line between the wards of Castle, Dock, and Trades.
Snail Street began in the Castle Ward, on the southern side of Waterdeep Way, and curved around a block of buildings before moving south for most of its length and passing through Soothsayers Way. After passing through Shesstras Street it entered the Dock Ward, where it continued its southward path until it met at an intersection with Fish Street. From there, Snail Street curved southeast, eventually terminating at Pressbow Lane.
Along the way to its destination, Snail Street acted as an eastern and western terminus for a large number of smaller lanes and alleyways. In the Castle Ward, it acted as the western terminus of Crossbow Lane, Niles Way and Rainrun Street. In the Trades Ward, roads that ended on the east side of Snail Street included Scroll Street and Simples Street.
In the Dock Ward, Snail Street acted as the eastern terminus of, in descending order, Blackstar Lane, Spiderweb Alley, Fish Street, Presper Street, and Shrimp Alley. From the west, roads that ended at Snail Street included the Street of Curtains, Trollcrook Alley, and Fillet Lane.
