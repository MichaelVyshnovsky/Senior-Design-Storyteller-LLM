'''Snail Street''' was a long, cobblestone paved, road in the city of [[Waterdeep]] that began in the [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]] and ended in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]]. Its northernmost portions sat directly on the boundary line between the wards of Castle, Dock, and [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades]].

==Location==
Snail Street began in the Castle Ward, on the southern side of [[Waterdeep Way]], and curved around a block of buildings before moving south for most of its length and passing through [[Soothsayer's Way]]. After passing through [[Shesstra's Street]] it entered the Dock Ward, where it continued its southward path until it met at an intersection with [[Fish Street (Waterdeep)|Fish Street]]. From there, Snail Street curved southeast, eventually terminating at [[Pressbow Lane]].

Along the way to its destination, Snail Street acted as an eastern and western terminus for a large number of smaller lanes and alleyways. In the Castle Ward, it acted as the western terminus of [[Crossbow Lane]], [[Niles Way]] and [[Rainrun Street]]. In the Trades Ward, roads that ended on the east side of Snail Street included [[Scroll Street]] and [[Simple's Street]].

In the Dock Ward, Snail Street acted as the eastern terminus of, in descending order, [[Blackstar Lane]], [[Spiderweb Alley]], Fish Street, [[Presper Street]], and [[Shrimp Alley]]. From the west, roads that ended at Snail Street included the [[Street of Curtains]], [[Trollcrook Alley]], and [[Fillet Lane]].
