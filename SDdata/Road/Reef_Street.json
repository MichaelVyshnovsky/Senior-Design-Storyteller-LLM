        "Description": "Reef Street was built far inland away from the shores of the [[Great Sea]]. Despite that fact, the street strongly smelled of the sea. Numerous [[aqueduct]]s were erected along the street, carrying seawater via wondrous water pumps built by Khaerbaal's artificer guild. All buildings on the street belonged to the upper and middle-class citizens of the city. Buildings on Reef Street were molded from living [[coral]]s through time, money, effort, and [[magic]]. The buildings' color varied from sandy pink to a deep rose.\n\nEach coral building was slowly grown over the course of several years. The first thing placed was the building's \"skeleton,\" made out of magically reinforced wood. Next, water was pumped on the top of the building frame, along with a small ''[[portal]]'' that attracted tiny coral creatures. They were tricked into building corals on the \"skeleton\" frame. The forming of coral started at the top and moved down. As the building was created, a cistern of water at the bottom of the frame collected trickling seawater and pumped it back up. once the building was complete, cistern was removed.\n\nCorals were not the only aquatic feature of Reef Street. Walls and [[iron]] fences were decorated in wave-like marine designs. Abundant topiaries were trimmed in shapes of various [[fish]], [[merfolk]], and other aquatic creatures. One of the bigger shops on the street had massive gates that were carved depicting a duo of intimidating-looking [[sahuagin]] wielding [[trident]]s.\n\nAnother shop with a sea-green awning found on Reef Street dealt in expensive [[enchanted]] weapons. Each item was protected by numerous ''[[dweomer]]s'' that warded the store's goods from theft.\n\nA big walled public park stood on Reef Street with a massive [[bilboa]] tree that dwarfed most buildings on it and on the neighboring [[Sultan Street]]."
