        "mainbody": "'''Tsarnen Alley''' was a short, hard-packed dirt and [[gravel]] paved, alleyway in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. It was frequently walked down by [[pilgrim]]s and [[priest]]s on their way to the [[Plinth]].",
        "Geography": "This alleyway ran in a straight line east from the [[Way of the Dragon (Waterdeep)|Way of the Dragon]] and terminated on the west side of [[Burdag Lane]].",
        "History": "Long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], traffic on this alley was often preyed upon by [[thieves]], until one day in the summer of [[1297 DR]] a [[ranger]] by the name of Tsarnen made it his duty to eliminate thieves in an unpleasant manner.\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century DR, with Tsarnen having long passed away, the alleyway received a small degree of thief activity. But the growth of greater thievery was discouraged by [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|Watch]] patrols.",

            "Links to Sewers": "An entrance to the [[sewers of Waterdeep]] could be found on the intersection of Burdag Lane and Tsarnen Alley."
