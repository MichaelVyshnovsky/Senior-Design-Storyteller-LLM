'''Wall Way''' was an extensive street in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]], that ran along the southern wall of the [[Waterdeep/City of the Dead|City of the Dead]] and part of the eastern [[Trollwall]].

==Geography==
This street ran east off of an intersection of [[Burnt Wagon Way]] and [[Zendulth Street]]. It was paved in corduroy-logs until it reached the southern gate of the City of the Dead. Along the way to that gate, Wall Way acted as the northern terminus of [[Mhaer's Alley]], [[Rivon Street]], and [[Sleepers' Walk]]. Wall Way then continued eastward as a road paved in hard-packed dirt and [[gravel]], being met from the south by [[Slipstone Street]], [[Quill Alley]], and [[Gaustus Street]].

Wall Way then curved southward as it reached the southern [[Guard Tower (City of the Dead)|Guard Tower]] of the City of the Dead, eventually terminating on [[River Street]]. Along the way southward to River Street, Wall Way acted as the eastern terminus of [[Walltower Walk]] and [[Sorn Street]].

==Notable Locations==
