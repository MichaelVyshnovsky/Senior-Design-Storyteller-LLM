Belduuk Road was a roadway found in Sembia that connected Saerloon in the south with Saerb in the north.
Originating in Saerloon on the Sea of Fallen Stars, the Belduuk Road stretched northwest, intersecting Mulhessen and the Way of the Manticore. The road proceeded north through bogs, passing through Olturret, before terminating at the town of Saerb. This northern stretch was colloquially known as "the Rattlebones Ride" because it was horribly bumpy as a result of countless logs buried in the ground to allow for travelers to cross the bogs.
