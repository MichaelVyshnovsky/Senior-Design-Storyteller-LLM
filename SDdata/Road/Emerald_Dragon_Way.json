        "mainbody": "Emerald Dragon Way was a prominent road found within the city of Suldolphor in far eastern Calimshan.\nEmerald Dragon Way ran directly through the heart of central Suldolphor, stretching between Ludluth Street and Gaeruls Street.\nThe road curved gently from side to side along its route. Emerald Dragon Way glittered with faerie fire which decorated the lavish homes found along its length.\nAll of Suldolphors wealthiest families, including the Uluevryns, Ilusprosters, Saccrarans, and many more, had estates lining both sides of Emerald Dragon Way.\nThe road was the site of a great battle between a forgotten hero and an emerald dragon. The hero prevailed and the bones of the great dragon were set into large transparent slabs found along both sides of the street.\nSome locals believed that anyone standing in front of the correct bone of the emerald dragon and asking a question with intense focus would hear the whispers of the slain beast giving answers or advice."
