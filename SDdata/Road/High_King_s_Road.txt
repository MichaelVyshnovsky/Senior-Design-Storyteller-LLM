The High Kings Road was the main thoroughfare in the kingdom of Callidyrr on the island of Alaron within the Moonshae Isles.
The High Kings Road stretched from one end of Callidyrr to the other. The road was branched in the north within the Fairheight Range, beginning in the mining settlements of Blackstone and White Rock and traveling nearly  to the south to terminate at Kythyss on the southern coast. The road crossed the Swanmay River near its midpoint within the Dernall Forest at the town of Horsa.
