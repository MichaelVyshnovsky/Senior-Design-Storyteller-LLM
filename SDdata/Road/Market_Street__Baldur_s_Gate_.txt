'''Market Street''' was a short street located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]], on the border with the [[Brampton]] neighborhood.

==Location==
Market Street cut through a city block, east to west. The city block was sandwitched between [[Nuthkhal's Way]]{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220221195407/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Nov â€“ Dec 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}} to the west and [[Stormshore Street]] to the east.

==Hisotry==
In the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, a suspicious [[half-orc]] butcher named [[Magnus Shank]] was said to had been selling monster meat to the customers. This accusation came at the time of a slew of murders in the Gate, and the butchery was thought to be involved and hide a more sinister secret than monster meat. The half-orc's supplier was a [[tiefling]] [[Selwyn Leventide]].
