It was paved in corduroy-logs until it reached the southern gate of the City of the Dead. Along the way to that gate, Wall Way acted as the northern terminus of Mhaers Alley, Rivon Street, and Sleepers Walk. Wall Way then continued eastward as a road paved in hard-packed dirt and gravel, being met from the south by Slipstone Street, Quill Alley, and Gaustus Street.\nWall Way then curved southward as it reached the southern Guard Tower of the City of the Dead, eventually terminating on River Street. Along the way southward to River Street, Wall Way acted as the eastern terminus of Walltower Walk and Sorn Street.\nLeague Office Guildhall of the League of Basketmakers & Wickerworkers."
