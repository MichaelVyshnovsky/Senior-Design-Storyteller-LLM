Vellarrs Lane was a roughly L-shaped cobblestone street in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.
This road ran south from Burnt Wagon Way, was intersected from the east and west by Spendthrift Alley, and then gradually curved curved eastward. It ran somewhat parallel to the more northerly Spendthrift Alley and eventually terminated at Tuckpurse Alley, which linked the easternmost ends of both streets.
Along the way to Tuckpurse Alley, this street was intersected from the north and south by both Rivon Street and the Street of the Tusks.
