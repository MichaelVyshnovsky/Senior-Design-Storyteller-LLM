'''Selvur Alley''' was an alleyway of hard-packed dirt and [[gravel]]<ref name=CoS.M"> in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].Across the editions this street went unlabeled on maps of Waterdeep. It was only revealed by [[Ed Greenwood]] on November 14{{th}}, 2021.

==Location==
This street stretched from north to south, going south from [[Malkur's Ride]] and terminating at the [[Beaconmarch]]. Not far from where it met the Beaconmarch, it was intersected by [[Dathantar’s Crawl]], and not far from where it met Malkur's Ride it jutted north into a cul-de-sac called [[Handaramatur’s Court]].

==History==
Selvur Alley was named for and constructed by a merchant named [[Selvur]] in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]], who bought up and tore down many decrepit buildings in the city block that stood between the Beaconmarch and Malkur's Ride.
