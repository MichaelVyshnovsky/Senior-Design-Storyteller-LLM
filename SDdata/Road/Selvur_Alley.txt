Selvur Alley was an alleyway of hard-packed dirt and gravel in the North Ward of Waterdeep.Across the editions this street went unlabeled on maps of Waterdeep. It was only revealed by Ed Greenwood on November 14, 2021.
This street stretched from north to south, going south from Malkurs Ride and terminating at the Beaconmarch. Not far from where it met the Beaconmarch, it was intersected by Dathantar’s Crawl, and not far from where it met Malkurs Ride it jutted north into a cul-de-sac called Handaramatur’s Court.
Selvur Alley was named for and constructed by a merchant named Selvur in the 13 century DR, who bought up and tore down many decrepit buildings in the city block that stood between the Beaconmarch and Malkurs Ride.
