        "mainbody": "urnback Court was a short, shallow lamp-lined courtyard and alleyway in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep.\nThis courtyard extended off the western end of Selduth Street, in front of the intersecting Swords Street, and stood close to the eastern cliff face of Mount Waterdeep.\n* This courtyard had only a few buildings nestled around it.\n* A large warehouse, which walled off the northern side of Turnback Court and was not visible to those passing by on Swords Street, was one of the courts more notable buildings. It was rumored to house magic items and its ownership was a mystery. The rumors that surrounded the latter included claims of it being the Harpers, the Lords Alliance, the Red Sashes, or even a secret cabal of wizards.\n* A surface shaft entrance to the citys sewers, which opened into a junction room, was located in this courtyard.\nTurnback Courts name derived from it being regularly used by both the City Watch and Guard as a rallying point for their daily and nightly patrols."
