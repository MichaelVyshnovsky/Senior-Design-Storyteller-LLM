        "Notable Locations": "* This courtyard had only a few buildings nestled around it.\n* A large '''warehouse''', which walled off the northern side of Turnback Court and was not visible to those passing by on Swords Street, was one of the court's more notable buildings. It was rumored to house [[magic item]]s and its ownership was a mystery. The rumors that surrounded the latter included claims of it being the [[Harpers]], the [[Lords' Alliance]], the [[Red Sashes]], or even a secret cabal of [[wizard]]s.\n* A surface shaft entrance to the [[Waterdeep/Sewers|city's sewers]], which opened into a junction room, was located in this courtyard.<ref name =\"WatN-p28\">",
        "Notable Inhabitants": "Turnback Court's name derived from it being regularly used by both the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] and [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|Guard]] as a rallying point for their daily and nightly patrols."
