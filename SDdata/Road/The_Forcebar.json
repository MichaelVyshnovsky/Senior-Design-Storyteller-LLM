        "mainbody": "The Forcebar was a small road that was located in the city of Waterdeep.\nThe Forcebar was located in the central section of Waterdeeps Southern Ward. The road originated on the High Road where it branched due east, ending on Tezambrils Street after a short distance. Anchorets Alley branched south off of the Forebars western side.\nThe road was originally named as it was designed with defense in mind. If Waterdeep was ever invaded the plan was to block strategic points on roads with rock magically transported from the Ethereal plane."
