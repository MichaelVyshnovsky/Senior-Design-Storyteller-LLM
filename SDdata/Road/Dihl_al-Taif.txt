'''Dihl al-Taif''', or the '''Ghost's Route''', was a trade route located in [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

The portion of Dihl al-Taif found within mighty [[Huzuz]] was called the [[Caravan Boulevard]].

==Description==
Caravans travelling by Dihl al-Taif followed [[Al-Sarif River]] east from Huzuz for {{SI|90|mi|k}} before heading north into the [[Haunted Lands]]. Another {{SI|100|mi|k}} of travel through harsh desert brought them to the small village of [[Zarif]]. Zarif was the last chance to re-supply for hundreds of miles.

After departing Zarif, several days of travel brought the caravan to the [[Oasis of Solitude]]. This oasis marked the last source of fresh water before reaching [[Al-Malih River]]. A {{SI|200|mi|k}} stretch of barren wasteland greeted the caravan before the land finally began to turn green again where it met Al-Malih River, which flowed northeast directly toward [[Halwa]] for another {{SI|150|mi|k}}.

==History==
Though rife with danger, this heavily trafficked trade route was the quickest way to transport goods between Halwa and Huzuz.
