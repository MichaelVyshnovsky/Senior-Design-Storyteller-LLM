The '''Trollmarch''', formerly known as the '''Trollwatch''' prior to the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], was a street in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Geography==
Trollmarch ran from north to south along the northern [[Trollwall]], emerging from the end of [[Tower March]] and terminating at [[Saerdoun Street]]. For much of its length the street was paved in dirt and gravel, until it was intersected by [[Horn Street]], at which point its pavement became corduroy-log.

Other streets that intersected with the Trollmarch along its length included [[Black Dog Alley]] and [[Selrin Street]].
