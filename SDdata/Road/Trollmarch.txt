The Trollmarch, formerly known as the Trollwatch prior to the 15 century DR, was a street in the North Ward of Waterdeep.
Trollmarch ran from north to south along the northern Trollwall, emerging from the end of Tower March and terminating at Saerdoun Street. For much of its length the street was paved in dirt and gravel, until it was intersected by Horn Street, at which point its pavement became corduroy-log.
Other streets that intersected with the Trollmarch along its length included Black Dog Alley and Selrin Street.
