The Treefall Pass was a narrow path through the Mountains of the Alaoreum.
The humble mountain path of the Treefall Pass separated the Orsraun Mountains from their northernmost peak clusterâ€”the Alaoreum Mountains. The pass ran from Turmish to the south, through the mountains, and reached the Gulthmere Forest to the north.
