The '''Treefall Pass''' was a narrow path through the [[Mountains of the Alaoreum]].

==Description==
The humble mountain path of the Treefall Pass separated the [[Orsraun Mountains]] from their northernmost peak clusterâ€”the Alaoreum Mountains. The pass ran from [[Turmish]] to the south, through the mountains, and reached the [[Gulthmere Forest]] to the north.
