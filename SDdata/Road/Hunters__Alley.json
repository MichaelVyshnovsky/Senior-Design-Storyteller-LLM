        "mainbody": "Hunters Alley was a narrow, hard-packed dirt and gravel paved, alleyway in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.\nThis road ran in a straight line east from Way of the Dragon, across from Soothsayers Way. Midway through the passage, it acted as the southern terminus of Burdag Lane.\nHunters Alley was named for two young, courageous brothers, who grew up to become a sage and an aspiring duke.\nThis alleyway was generally a safe passage to journey through."
