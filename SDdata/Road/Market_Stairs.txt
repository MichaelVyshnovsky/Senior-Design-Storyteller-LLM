The '''Market Stairs''' was one of three major pedestrian stairs that connected the lower city and the [[Tilverton/Old Town|Old Town]] in the [[Cormyrean]] city of [[Tilverton]].

==Geography==
The Market Stairs were the stairs in the center of town, while the [[Tilver Stairs]] were in the southern part, and the [[Cormyr Stairs]] stood on Tilverton's western side. The stair climb was the only way into the less crowded and more prosperous Old Town apart from passing the [[Upper City Gate]] on the southernmost side of Tilverton. The stair's name was derived from its being directly connected to Tilverton's market at the heart of the city. Atop the Market Stairs stood a landing where the [[Rose Altar]] dedicated to [[Lathander]], the Bringer of the Dawn, could be found. Just like the Tilver Stairs, the Market Stairs stood on the [[Street of the Sorceress]] that wildly veered and split through both parts of the city.
