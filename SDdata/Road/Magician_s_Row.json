        "mainbody": "agicians Row was a street in Ravens Bluff named for the number of wizards who dwelled there in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nIt was a short stretch of only five houses, each of different colors, styles, sizes, and states of disrepair. They were\n# Yellow, one story home of Norweg the Magnificent\n# Blue, two story home of Ukran the Great\n# Red, two story home of Glishman the Annoying\n# Gray, single story home of Paniar the Obese\n# Green, two stories home of Panese the Excitable\nCirca 1357 DR, Norweg and Panese separately stole two minor magic items of historical importance from the city vaults at approximately the same time. Though the thieves were unidentified, clues at the crime scenes, suspicions, and divinations tracked them to Magicians Row. The City Guard serving Regent of the Exchequer Vernon Condor only had time to search two of the five houses before they earned their bosss ire, so they tried to deduce the culprits from what they knew of the five wizards on Magicians Row."
