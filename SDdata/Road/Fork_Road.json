        "Description": "Starting at [[Sundabar]], the Fork Road passed by [[Newfort]] just before the road entered the gap between the [[Nether Mountains]] and the [[Rauvin Mountains]]. Five miles before [[the Fork]], where Fork Road met the [[Adbar Road]], down a narrow cart track was the village of [[Deadsnows]]. After the Fork, an unnamed path continued to end at [[Ascore]].\n\nThe road was paved but old. By [[1372 DR]], the pavement stones were cracked and had deep ruts, but considering their age, they were in good repair.",
        "History": "The Fork Road, together with the Adbar Road, was an old [[Dwarf|dwarven]] road dating back to the kingdom of [[Delzoun]].",
