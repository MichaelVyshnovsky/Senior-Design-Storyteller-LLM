        "mainbody": "The Phlan Path was the road along the northern coast of the Moonsea lake that connected the cities of Phlan and Melvaunt.\nWhile it was one of the most well-developed roads along the northern coast of the sea, for some stretches it was merely a well-trodden dirt path.\nThe Phlan path intersected with the Iron Route at the bank of the Stojanow River near Phlan.\nTraveling east from Phlan, the path intercepted the termination of Toranths March, the southbound trail from Castle Vathar, before intersecting the Trank River at a lone bridge crossing. It wound through the Moonwatch Hills before finally reaching Melvaunt.\nIn the , group of bandits operating along the Phlan Path slew a lone ogre ravager traveling down from Thar. The ogre carried a unique obelisk made of jade, that was in fact the key that could open up the Tomb of Vorbyx.\nHighwaymen continued to plague the road even a century later, as the Merchants Guild of Phlan suffered a number of robberies along that stretch of the Moonsea North.\nAround that same time rumors circulated that orcs were assaulting people that traveled along the Phlan Path.\n* Crossing Inn, a stopover establishment located on the south side of the path on the east bank of the Trank River.>"
