        "mainbody": "The '''Road of Jackals''' was a pass through the [[Scimitar Spires]], known to the ancient [[Netherese]] as Humaithira.",
        "Geography": "The Road was one of two passes that cut through the Scimitar Spires, along with the [[Gap of Skulls]]. It was located towards the southern end of the Scimitar Spires, and could shorten a journey past the mountains by at least a hundred miles.",
        "History": "Humaithira served as the location of the [[Last Stand at Humaithira]] in {{yearlinkConvert|2298|NY}}, which saw several hundred Netherese soldiers led by Strategor [[Matick]] fight against the [[giant]]s of Thane [[Bl√≥ta]]. Though Matick was slain and the pass taken by the giants, the heroic sacrifice allowed a later Netherese army to ultimately defeat the army of giants.\n\nBy the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], few [[Bedine]] had explored the pass, and thus not many could make their way through the Road of Jackals.\n\nAt some point around {{yearlink|1368}},The default 2{{nd}}-edition date of 1368 DR is assumed. a number of caravans went missing trying to find another way across the mountains.{{cite Polyhedron UK/1/Just Deserts|10}}"
