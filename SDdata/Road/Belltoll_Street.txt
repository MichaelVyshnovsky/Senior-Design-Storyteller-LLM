Belltoll Street was a slightly curved street that began on the The Wide, ran west and ended at a moot in front of the home of sage Ragefast in the Upper City of Baldurs Gate.
Belltoll Street began at one of the western enrages into The Wide, where the Hlath Estate stood, on the edge of the Temples District. From there, the street cut through the entire Temples District, passing between the Portyr Estate and the High Hall, crossing Windspell Street where the Vanthampur Villa and the Helm and Cloak stood. Belltoll Street continued moving west into the Manorborn district, crossing Sornbanner Street, slightly curving north, and passing the Ladys Hall temple, until reaching the moot in front of Ragefasts manse.
