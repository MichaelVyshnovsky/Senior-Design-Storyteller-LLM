==Location==
The Harbor Loop was found in the eastern section of the city. It began and ended along [[Silverpiece Way]], looping toward Westgate's harbor. The small street known as the [[Wizard's Cut]] connected to the middle of the Harbor Loop. Several prominent families, including the [[Cormaeril]]'s and [[Ssemm]]'s, owned docks touching the street.
