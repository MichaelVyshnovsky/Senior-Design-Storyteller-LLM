The '''South Road''' was located in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
The South Road encircled the City of Delights from the south, providing access to all of the major gates before connecting with the [[River Road]] on the north side of the city. The South Road was a viable option for those who wished to get around Huzuz but did not want to deal with crowded gate traffic or the congested streets within the city walls.
