        "Notable Inhabitants": "Ruid's Stroll was a fairly safe alley, owing to it being regularly traversed by members of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] and [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|Watch]]. However, it was also by haunted by the [[ghost]] of a [[mage]], who was the alleyway's namesake.\n\n[[Ruid]]'s ghost only appeared on foggy nights, dressed in dark cowled [[robe]]s and wielding a [[staff]]. It always manifested at the end of Caravan Court within swirling mists, made no sound as it walked, and finally faded away as it reached the Trollwall tower. The ghost could not be [[banishment|banished]] or [[turn undead|turned]] and it never reacted to the living. Anyone who touched or passed through would be shaken by a terrible, deathly chill, followed by the learning of a secret truth, specifically one about someone or something in their life."
