        "mainbody": "Seven Temples Square, formerly known as Five Temples Square, was a lopsided courtyard in the Trade Quarter of Myth Nantar, an aquatic elf city beneath the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nIn the 14 century DR, a number of merfolk and locathah pitched camps around this courtyard, waiting for more of Myth Nantars housing to be restored after the devastation wrought by the Twelfth Ser√¥s War.\nBy the 15 century DR, two additional temples had been constructed in the courtyard and thus necessitated a change in name to Seven Temples Square.\nThe namesake of Seven Temples Square was the seven temples that surrounded it, all of which were founded by immigrant races so that they would have a place of worship for their peoples deity, and was a holy ground to them all. These temples were as follows\n* The Dukars Hand, a temple dedicated to Azuth.\n* The Emerald Grove, a temple dedicated to Eldath\n* Descantor, a temple dedicated to Milil.\n* Hall of Living Memory.\n* Scriveners Harbor, a temple dedicated to Oghma.\n* Sevesheltor, a temple dedicated to Mystra."
