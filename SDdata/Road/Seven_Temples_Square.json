        "History": "In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a number of [[merfolk]] and [[locathah]] pitched camps around this courtyard, waiting for more of Myth Nantar's housing to be restored after the devastation wrought by the [[Twelfth Serôs War]].\n\nBy the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], two additional temples had been constructed in the courtyard and thus necessitated a change in name to Seven Temples Square.",
        "Notable Locations": "The namesake of Seven Temples Square was the seven temples that surrounded it, all of which were founded by immigrant races so that they would have a place of worship for their people's [[deity]], and was a holy ground to them all. These temples were as follows:\n* [[The Dukar's Hand]], a temple dedicated to [[Azuth]].\n* '''The Emerald Grove''', a temple dedicated to [[Eldath]]\n* '''Descantor''', a temple dedicated to [[Milil]].\n* [[Hall of Living Memory]].\n* [[Scrivener's Harbor]], a temple dedicated to [[Oghma]].\n* '''Sevesheltor''', a temple dedicated to [[Mystra]]."
