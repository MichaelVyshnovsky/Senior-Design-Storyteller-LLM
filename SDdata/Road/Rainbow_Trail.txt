The '''Rainbow Trail''' was located in [[Ra-Khati]].

==Geopgraphy==
The trail was found at the junction of the [[Gogrus River|Gogrus]] and [[Akundi River|Akundi]] rivers where they met at the [[Rainbow Falls]]. It passed by a series of buildings making up the [[Rainbow Monastery]] along a treacherous decent of over a thousand feet at the bottom of the waterfall.

==Activities==
The trail was used heavily by travelers and [[pilgrim]]s passing through Ra-Khati. Monks from the monastery aided them in transporting their goods up and down the trail in return for a donation.
