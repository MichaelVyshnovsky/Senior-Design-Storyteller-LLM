        "mainbody": "The '''Gem Road''' was a major highway in [[Amn]] that served as the main route between [[Esmeltaran]] and [[Keczulla]].",
        "Geography": "The road wound along the shore of [[Lake Esmel]] and the bank of the [[Splendarrllur]] river for much of its length, and passed near the rumored location of [[Myth Lharast]].",
        "Defenses": "The Gem Road was heavily patrolled by a [[Council Army]] garrison based out of Keczulla that also provided escorts for caravans. During the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], this detachment was commanded by Colonel [[Gladdos Wintosnip]], who ensured that his soldiers did their duty and weren't bought off by rich merchants seeking extra services.",
        "History": "The Gem Road was built as a response to the increasing wealth and prosperity of Keczulla following the discovery of the [[Tanislove]]'s new [[gem]] mines in [[1355 DR]]. It was planned and sponsored by the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] and Lord [[Pulth Tanislove]], and construction began in [[1359 DR]]. Although Pulth died in [[1361 DR]], his son [[Pehllus Tanislove|Pehllus]] oversaw its completion in [[1366 DR]].",
