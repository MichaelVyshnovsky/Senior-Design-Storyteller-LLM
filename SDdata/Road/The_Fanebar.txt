'''The Fanebar''' was a corduroy-log paved,<ref name=CoS.M" /> short alleyway in the northern section of the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].<ref name=CoS.M" />

==Geography==
This alleyway ran from northeast to southwest, coming off of [[Trollkill Street]] and terminating at [[Skulls Street]]. Towards the middle of the Fanebar a narrow passageway opened off its eastern side into [[Rook Alley]].<ref name=CoS.M" />

==Notable Locations==
* At the southernmost corner of the Fanebar, at the passageway leading into Rook Alley and [[Kulzar's Alley]], there rested a stone half-hidden under a downspout. If that stone were activated, it would act as a ''[[portal]]'' to [[Maldiglasâ€™s Refuge]].<ref>
