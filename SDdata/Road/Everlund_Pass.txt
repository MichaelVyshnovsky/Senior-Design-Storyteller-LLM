The '''Everlund Pass''' was the road from [[Everlund]] to [[Silverymoon]], which crossed the western end of the [[Nether Mountains]].

==Geography==
The rough trail ran roughly on the eastern side of the [[River Rauvin]], sometimes hundreds of feet above the river, and it snaked far away from the rushing waters into dangerous hills. 

===Travel Times and Distances===
; [[Everlund]] to [[Silverymoon]] : 50 miles (80 km).

==Notable Locations==
A little over half-way between Everlund and Silverymoon was the [[Moonwyvern Inn]], a cozy place that didn't ask too many questions.{{Cite dragon/288/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: The Moonwyvern Inn|74}}

==Inhabitants==
Many monsters roamed the area surrounding the valley, but patrols from Silverymoon and Everlund ''mostly'' kept the path clear.

[[Clarshee Taraghe]] was the proprietress of the Moonwyvern Inn as of the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].
