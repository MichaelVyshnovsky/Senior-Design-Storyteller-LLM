The Halondar, originally called the Turmway, was a road in the Vilhon Reach that stretched from Alagh√¥n to Hlondeth.
The Halondar ran through the Halondar Valley between the Orsraun Mountains and the Aphrunn Mountains before nearly bisecting Turmish. Xorhun was a major stopping point at the end of a trail a few miles off the road.
The road was originally named the Turmway. In 37 DR, the foundation of Hlondeth marked its westernmost end.
