Candle Lane, also known as Candle Alley, was a minor avenue of hard-packed earth and gravel in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.
This curving road ran from east to west, running northwest off of the Way of the Dragon and terminating at Book Street. At Candle Lanes northeast end, it ended at the Way of the Dragon at a three-way junction with Zastrow Street.
