Along the way it acted as the western terminus of Anteos Lane.\nIn later years, the area that Brassfeather terminated at would be designated as part of Thunderstaff Way.\nBrassfeather Lane was named, sometime prior to the 14 century DR, after a famous smith who had lived along it.\n* Brossfeather Towers, the family estate of the noble house Brossfeather, which had been constructed along Brassfeather Lane due to its similarity to the noble familys name.\n* The home and workshop of Huldeth Brassfeather, the streets namesake."
