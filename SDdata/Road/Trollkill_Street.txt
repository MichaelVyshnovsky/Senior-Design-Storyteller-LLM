This road was primarily paved in corduroy logs in the Sea Ward, interspliced with a section of cobblestone in front of the Heroes Garden. In the North Ward, Trollkill Street was paved in hard-packed dirt and gravel.
Trollkill Street began in the Sea Ward, on the east side of the Street of the Singing Dolphins northern end, and marched southeastward along the Trollwall. Along the way it acted as the northern terminus of, in order of left to right the Street of Lances, Aureenar Street, Sanborim Street, Heroes Walk, Kulzars Alley, and the Fanebar.In the map used for the Sea Ward in the infobox above, sourced from Map05 of the City System accessory, Sanborim Street is mislabeled as Sanborn Street.
At the border of Sea Ward and the North Ward, Trollkill Street intersected with the High Road, right before the latter passed through the Upper Towers. From there it continued eastward into the North Ward, becoming the northern terminus of, in order of left to right Brassfeather Lane, Anteos Lane, and Phull Lane. The road eventually terminated at the northern end of Tower March, right before the Farwatch Tower.
