'''Trollkill Street''' was a large road in the city of [[Waterdeep]], spanning nearly the whole northern portion of the [[Trollwall]], that started in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] and ended in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]].

==Description==
[[File:Trollkill Street CoS-map.png|thumb|right|273px|''A portion of a circa [[1368 DR]] map, depicting Trollkill Street's varying pavements.'']]
This road was primarily paved in corduroy logs in the Sea Ward, interspliced with a section of cobblestone in front of the [[Heroes' Garden]]. In the North Ward, Trollkill Street was paved in hard-packed dirt and [[gravel]].

==Location==
Trollkill Street began in the Sea Ward, on the east side of the [[Street of the Singing Dolphin]]'s northern end, and marched southeastward along the Trollwall. Along the way it acted as the northern terminus of, in order of left to right: the [[Street of Lances]], [[Aureenar Street]], [[Sanborim Street]], [[Heroes' Walk]], [[Kulzar's Alley]], and [[the Fanebar]].In the map used for the Sea Ward in the infobox above, sourced from Map05 of the ''[[City System]]'' accessory, '''Sanborim Street''' is mislabeled as '''Sanborn Street'''.

At the border of Sea Ward and the North Ward, Trollkill Street intersected with the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]], right before the latter passed through the [[Upper Towers]]. From there it continued eastward into the North Ward, becoming the northern terminus of, in order of left to right: [[Brassfeather Lane]], [[Anteos Lane]], and [[Phull Lane]]. The road eventually terminated at the northern end of [[Tower March]], right before the [[Farwatch Tower]].
