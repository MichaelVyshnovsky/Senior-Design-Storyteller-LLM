        "mainbody": "hilosophers Court, which was also called Philosophers Square or the Foolsquare, was a small courtyard that was located in the city of Waterdeep.\nPhilosophers Court was located in Waterdeeps Dock Ward. The buildings forming the court were enclosed to the south by the Street of Curtains, to the east by Book Street, to the west by Snail Street, and an unnamed alley bordered the north.\nThe location derived its name from the fact that it was a common meeting place for intellectuals to gather to debate and argue. Drunks often slept their intoxication off here as well."
