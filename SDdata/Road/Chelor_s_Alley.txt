'''Chelor's Alley''' was a short alleyway of hard-packed dirt and [[gravel]] in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Geography==
This alleyway ran due west off of the [[Court of the White Bull]], terminating on [[Deloun Alley]].

==Notable Locations==
;[[House of Chelor]]: the residence of [[Chelor]], the alleyway's namesake. The home had a great deal of [[lantern]]s set in its upstairs windows, providing illumination to the alley below. Because of this, some used Chelor's Alleyway as a night time rendezvous when in need of light, including nightly patrols of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] and [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|Watch]] when needing to investigate evidence.<ref>
