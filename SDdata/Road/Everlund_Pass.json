        "mainbody": "he Everlund Pass was the road from Everlund to Silverymoon, which crossed the western end of the Nether Mountains.\nThe rough trail ran roughly on the eastern side of the River Rauvin, sometimes hundreds of feet above the river, and it snaked far away from the rushing waters into dangerous hills. \n Everlund to Silverymoon  50 miles (80 km).\nA little over half-way between Everlund and Silverymoon was the Moonwyvern Inn, a cozy place that didnt ask too many questions.\nMany monsters roamed the area surrounding the valley, but patrols from Silverymoon and Everlund mostly kept the path clear.\nClarshee Taraghe was the proprietress of the Moonwyvern Inn as of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR."
