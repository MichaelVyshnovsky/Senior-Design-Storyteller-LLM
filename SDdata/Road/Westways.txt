The '''Westways''' were a series of tunnels and roads that led west from the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]] to [[Blingdenstone]] and [[Mithral Hall]], as well as to [[Mantol-Derith]] and [[Phanlinksal]].

==Description==
The Westways tunnels were heavily patrolled by drow forces near Menzoberranzan.

==Route==
The Westways ran from Menzoberranzan some 50 miles west to the [[svirfneblin]] city of [[Blingdenstone]]. They then turned east to [[Mithral Hall]] and led to some entrances to the surface in [[Luruar]]. The route also branched out to [[Mantol-Derith]] and the [[illithid]] enclave of [[Phanlinksal]].

==History==
The Westways gates in Menzoberranzan had never successfully been breached by invading forces by the 1360s [[DR]].
