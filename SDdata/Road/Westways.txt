The Westways were a series of tunnels and roads that led west from the drow city of Menzoberranzan to Blingdenstone and Mithral Hall, as well as to Mantol-Derith and Phanlinksal.
The Westways tunnels were heavily patrolled by drow forces near Menzoberranzan.
The Westways ran from Menzoberranzan some 50 miles west to the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone. They then turned east to Mithral Hall and led to some entrances to the surface in Luruar. The route also branched out to Mantol-Derith and the illithid enclave of Phanlinksal.
The Westways gates in Menzoberranzan had never successfully been breached by invading forces by the 1360s DR.
