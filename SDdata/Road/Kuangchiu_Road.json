        "mainbody": "The '''Kuangchiu Road''' (also spelled as the '''Kuang Chu Road'''\n\nIt began near the city of [[Chaoyang]] in [[Chukei|Chukei Province]] of Shou Lung. Here the Kuangchiu Road joined the [[Spice Road]], which ran west and south; some considered the south-running Spice Road in [[Ma' Yuan|Ma' Yuan Province]] part of the Kuangchiu Road.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms]]'' page 10 says the Kuangchiu Road also passes through Ma' Yuan, which neighbors Chukei. However, the following page says the Spice Road runs through Ma' Yuan. The map accompanying ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'' doesn't name the southern road, not does the ''[[Kara-Tur Trail Map]]''. Instead, ''[[The Forgotten Realms Atlas]]'' names this road the Spice Road, confirm its continuation. Chaoyang maintained a border garrison to guard this junction.\n\nRunning north, it passed through [[Kangste]], the major trade town on the Kuangchiu Road.\n\nBeyond this point, on maps, the road disappeared into the [[Koryaz Mountains]].No map shows the road continuing past the base of the Koryaz Mountains. Instead, it simply stops. In order to connect to Koryo overland, it presumably must cross the mountains and all the northern lands, but magical solutions may be possible. However, its true course remains unknown."
