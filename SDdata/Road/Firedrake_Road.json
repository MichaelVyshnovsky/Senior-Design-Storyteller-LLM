        "mainbody": "'''Firedrake Road''' was a winding trail that ran between the town of [[Mosstone]] and [[Velen]], along the [[Dragon's Neck Peninsula]] of [[Tethyr]].",
        "Description": "The humble road was a trail hardened by ages of moving wheels. All along the trail, one could see numerous small hamlets. Some compared their placements and abundance to [[pearl]]s on a necklace. One side of the trail overlooked the scenic bay, while the other brushed against the unspoiled woods of the peninsula.\n\nTraveling along Firedrake Road was not the easiest. Parts of the trail passed through dangerous rocky roads where travelers could only use small carts or travel on foot along narrow passages. Further north, the forked part of Firedrake Road was wild and overgrown, and its vegetation hid brigands and [[human]]-murdering [[wild elves]].",
        "Geography": "[[File:Firedrake Road end.png|thumb|''The final bends of the Firedrake Road before it reached town of [[Velen]].''|330x330px]]\nFiredrake Road stretched along the [[Firedrake Shores]] on the southern side of the Dragon's Neck Peninsula, running from Mosstone, hugging the waters of [[Firedrake Bay]] and continuing north. The first location of note, closest to Mosstone, was the [[Monastery of St. Domin]]; further along the trail stood the unkempt [[Black Tomb of the Corsair]]. Then the trail ran past hamlets of [[Rock Orchard]] and [[Viperstone]] and ran into the village of [[Toaketh]], where the trail crossed with a road that went north to [[Murann]] along ruins of [[Khalid's Wall]]. [[Jhaansciim]] welcomed Firedrake Road to the Dragon's Neck Peninsula, forking at the village of [[Tulmene]] at the base of the [[Dragon's Head]]. From there, the road moved along the Head's \"maw\" â€“ the western shores and ending in the town of Velen. Along the curvature of the \"maw,\" the road passed [[Carlsmere]] and the [[Dragondownrise Ruins]] located at [[The Bite]]. From there, Firedrake Road moved towards [[Cape Velen]], passing several ruins: [[Tharamon]], \n[[Presmer]], [[Dargree]], and [[Manor Atheon]]. Finally, the road veered along [[Asavir's Channel]], past [[Blackthorn Manor]], ending in Velen.",
        "Trade": "Despite the relative wilderness of the trail, several locations along Firedrake Road were merchants' destinations. Some of the goods that were purchased and transported along the road were [[apple]]s from Rock Orchard, [[net]]s from [[Valtreth]], [[poison]]s from Viperstone, and ''[[Toaketh knives]]'' from Toaketh.",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[Black Tomb of the Corsair]], a cove with the tomb of King [[Haedrak II]] above.\n*[[Khalid's Wall]], a long ruined wall that ran perpendicular Firedrake Road, along the road that connected the trail with the town of Murann to the north.\n*[[Monastery of St. Domin]], a monastery renowned for its shipbuilding.\n*[[Rock Orchard]], aptly named hamlet that grew apples.\n*[[Toaketh]], hamlet named after once prominent [[mage]], entombed in the same village.\n*[[Tulmene]], a port village filled with sailors, fishers, and pirates.\n*[[Valtreth]], arguably the most notable hamlet along the trail, renown for their high quality nets.\n*[[Viperstone]], a [[Calishite]] village where alchemists caught venomous [[snake]]s to use in their craft."
