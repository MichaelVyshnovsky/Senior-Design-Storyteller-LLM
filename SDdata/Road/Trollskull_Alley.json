        "mainbody": "'''Trollskull Alley''' was an alley located in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Geography": "The alley was a narrow passage that wound through the interior of the city block surrounded in the North and South by [[Saerdoun Street]] and [[Delzorin Street]] and in the East and West by [[Whaelgond Way]] and [[Windborne Way]], respectively. Two entrance points existed into the alley from Saerdoun Street and one from Delzorin Street. The alley itself ran parallel to Delzorin Street at its eastern end.\n\nAt the southeast end of the alley, closest to the intersection between Whaelgond Way and Delzorin Street, a removable metal grate opened into a surface shaft that led to the Waterdhavian sewer system.\n\nThe narrow alley was marked by its architecture of closely-constructed rowhouses. Several business buildings also backed onto it from the surrounding streets.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} a ''[[fireball]]'' was detonated in the alley by a [[nimblewright]] in the service of [[Yalah Gralhund]], as part of an assassination attempt on the [[gnome]] [[Dalakhar]]. The blast killed eleven people, including Dalakhar and two of his [[Zhentarim]] pursuers, a group of [[halfling]] street artists, and several other civilians.\n\nThe nimblewright's objective was to obtain from Dalakhar the ''[[Stone of Golorr]]'', an item that contained information on the whereabouts of a large treasure that had been obtained illegally by [[Dagult Neverember]] during his time as [[Open Lord]] and lay hidden somewhere in Waterdeep. The blast injured [[Urstul Floxin]], who was also in pursuit of Dalakhar, but he managed to survive and take the stone to [[Gralhund Villa]].",
        "Notable Locations": "[[File:Trollskull_manor-5e.jpg|thumb|280px|''The abandoned Trollskull Manor.'']]\n* The [[Bent Nail]], a carpentry shop owned by the [[half-elf]] [[Talisolvanar Fellbranch]].\n* The [[Book Wyrm's Treasure]], a bookshop owned by the [[dragonborn]] [[Rishaal]]. The shop also dealt with [[spellbook]]s and offered services to copy ''[[spell scroll]]s''.\n* [[Corellon's Crown]], an apothecary shop and greenhouse owned by the [[wood elf]] [[druid]] [[Fala Lefaliir]].\n* [[Steam and Steel]], a forge co-owned and run by the [[fire genasi]] [[Embric]], an expert weapons maker, and the [[water genasi]] [[Avi]], an expert armorsmith.\n* The [[Tiger's Eye]], a private detective's office run by the investigator [[Valantajar|Vincent Trench]].\n* [[Trollskull Manor]], the largest building in the alley, had once been a tavern. By 1492 DR, it was abandoned and haunted by the [[poltergeist]] of [[Lif]], its former owner.",
        "Inhabitants": "In the midâ€’14{{th}} century [[DR]], Trollskull Alley was frequently occupied by gambling gangs of rich youths. At night, the alley became the territory of aggressive gangs.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century DR, Trollskull Alley was inhabited mostly by upper-middle class Waterdhavians."
