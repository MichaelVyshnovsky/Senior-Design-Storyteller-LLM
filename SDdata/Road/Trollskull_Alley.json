        "mainbody": "Trollskull Alley was an alley located in the North Ward of Waterdeep.\nThe alley was a narrow passage that wound through the interior of the city block surrounded in the North and South by Saerdoun Street and Delzorin Street and in the East and West by Whaelgond Way and Windborne Way, respectively. Two entrance points existed into the alley from Saerdoun Street and one from Delzorin Street. The alley itself ran parallel to Delzorin Street at its eastern end.\nAt the southeast end of the alley, closest to the intersection between Whaelgond Way and Delzorin Street, a removable metal grate opened into a surface shaft that led to the Waterdhavian sewer system.\nThe narrow alley was marked by its architecture of closely-constructed rowhouses. Several business buildings also backed onto it from the surrounding streets.\nIn the , a fireball was detonated in the alley by a nimblewright in the service of Yalah Gralhund, as part of an assassination attempt on the gnome Dalakhar. The blast killed eleven people, including Dalakhar and two of his Zhentarim pursuers, a group of halfling street artists, and several other civilians.\nThe nimblewrights objective was to obtain from Dalakhar the Stone of Golorr, an item that contained information on the whereabouts of a large treasure that had been obtained illegally by Dagult Neverember during his time as Open Lord and lay hidden somewhere in Waterdeep. The blast injured Urstul Floxin, who was also in pursuit of Dalakhar, but he managed to survive and take the stone to Gralhund Villa.\nthumb|280px|The abandoned Trollskull Manor.\n* The Bent Nail, a carpentry shop owned by the half-elf Talisolvanar Fellbranch.\n* The Book Wyrms Treasure, a bookshop owned by the dragonborn Rishaal.

At night, the alley became the territory of aggressive gangs.\nBy the late 15 century DR, Trollskull Alley was inhabited mostly by upper-middle class Waterdhavians."
