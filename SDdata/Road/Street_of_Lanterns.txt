The Street of Lanterns was a murky, refuse-lined road in an unsavory part of the Old City section of Iriaebor in the 14 century DR.
This road intersected with the Street of Jewels.
The Prince and Pauper, a gambling establishment.
It was not uncommon to find painted ladies soliciting favors for coin along this street, nor rats scurrying among its trash-lined gutters.
