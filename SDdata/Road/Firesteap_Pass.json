        "Location": "Firesteap Pass was located in the western end of the Firesteap Mountains, south of the city of [[Innarlith]], beginning just past the [[Firesteap Citadel]]. There existed at least one cavern with its entrance located in the Firesteap Pass. A magic ''[[gate]]'' within the cave was connected to a ruin on one of the islands of [[Marsember]] in [[Cormyr]]. The ''gate'' could be activated via singing, playing, or humming a certain tune."
