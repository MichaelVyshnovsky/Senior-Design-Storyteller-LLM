The '''Long Road''' was a route in [[northeast Faerûn]] that connected the Kingdom of [[Damara]] to the far north of [[Rashemen]].

==Description==
The road provided a trade route between the [[Cold Lands]] and the [[Unapproachable East]], connecting the merchants of Damara, Rashemen, and [[Narfell]]. as the road was little more than a wide trail, and parts were impassable during the winter.

==Geography==
While some maps put the route’s western origin in Damara at [[Helgabal]], the Long Road itself truly began along the [[Merchant's Run]] just south of the city of [[Trailsend]] in the [[Barony of Polten]]. From there, it travelled northeast along the edge of the [[Dunwood]], passing through the town of [[Tellerth]] before heading north through the [[Giantspire Mountains]] at [[Giant Gap]] to arrive in Narfell. The Gap was less a pass and more an area of low hills between the mountains, and was known to become clogged with snow in the winter months.

In Narfell, the route passed the [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] meeting grounds at [[Nar-sek Qu'istrade]] before proceeding east to its first major stopover at the village of [[Jiyyd]], at [[Mistbridge]] and crossing the [[Iceborn River]], before finally ending in [[Nathoud]] at the base of the [[Icerim Mountains]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Trailsend]], a city on the western end of the route, although the road truly began further south of the city along [[Merchant's Run]].
* [[Tellerth]], a farming and logging town in Damara.
* [[Giantspire Gap]], the pass through the Giantspire Mountains.
* [[Nar-sek Qu'istrade]], a neutral meeting place of the Nar tribes.
* [[Jiyyd]], a crossroads village in Narfell connecting the route to [[Peltarch]].
* [[Ormpur (Narfell)|Ormpur]], a trademeet in Narfell.
* [[N'Jast]], a crossroads village in Narfell where the Long Road crossed the [[Cold Road]].
* [[Mistbridge]], where the road crossed the River Erech.
* [[Fortress of the Half-Demon]], an ancient Nar castle.
* [[Nathoud]], a fortified town on the eastern end of the route. Here the Long Road met the [[Huhrong's Road]].
