Border Street was, by far, the longest road located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the mid–14 century DR.
Border Street ran along the entire inside perimeter of Zhentil Keeps defensive outer wall, full encircling the portion of Zhentil Keep on the northern shore of the River Tesh. The street was found in the Common Quarter, with two small section of the street crossing into the Harbor District.
Eight different Zhentilar guardposts were located along Border Street. Four of Zhentil Keeps six gates–the Trail Gate, Dragon Gate, North Force Gate, and North Tesh Gate–connected to Border Street as well. Given its vast length, many of Zhentil Keeps road intersected Border Street. These included Wyvern Road, Cobble Road, Nool Street, Fortress Street, Trident Avenue, Merchant Street, the Street of Dragons, the Street of Swords, Dusk Street, Realm Street, Vice Street, Alley Way, and Ocean Way.
