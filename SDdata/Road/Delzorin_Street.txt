'''Delzorin Street''' was a street in [[Waterdeep]] that ran east to west in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]]. The street ended on a left turn at [[Whaelgond Way]].

==Notable Locations==
* [[Ulbrinter Villa]], the estate of the noble [[Ulbrinter]] family, was located here, between [[Vhezoar Street]] and [[Brondar's Way]]. Being the street's most remarkable building, the mansion was of beautiful architecture, with high-rising towers and conical turret-tops.
* The [[Massalan]] and [[Lanngolyn]] families also owned villas on Delzorin Street.
* [[Yellowcrest Manor]], once the home of the [[Yellowcrest]] family, stood on Delzorin Street. After most of the Yellowcrests were horrifically murdered, the [[Falgarst]] family assumed ownership of the manor.
* [[Nandar's Ride]], a small road leading up to the villa of the [[Nandar]] family.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2014)/Waterdeep alleys}}
* The South entrance into [[Trollskull Alley]] was located on Delzorin Street.
* One of the rowhouses between Delzorin Street and Trollskull Alley was a [[Harper]] safehouse, and contained a [[magic]]al entryway to [[Harpers' Hold]].{{Cite dragon/211/"I Sing a Song by the Deep-Water Bay"}}

===Links to Sewers===
Delzorin Street was used as a reference point for three different surface shafts to enter the [[Waterdeep/Sewers|sewers of Waterdeep]]:
* One that was between [[Sul Street]] and [[Shield Street]] that allowed entrance into a junction room.
* One that was in the block for which the Delzorin Street represented one of its borders.
* One close to the intersection with the Whaelgond Way.
