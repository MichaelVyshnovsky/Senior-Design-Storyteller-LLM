The Northern Means was a windswept trail that connected the city of Luskan to the Frozenfar.
The trail started in Luskan and headed north until it met the Ten Trail south of the Spine of the World. It was snowy and windy with very few trees or hills along it to provide shelter. Moreover, the trail practically disappeared during the winter due to heavy snowfall.
Trade caravans traveling along the Northern Means were frequently attacked by the Black Raven Tribe.
