'''Low Street''' was a shady street in [[Khaerbaal]], a port city of [[Halruaa]].

==History==
Low Street of Khaerbaal was known for its [[rogue]]s and [[thieves]]. [[Tzigone]], then known as [[Sindra]], a hero of Halruaa, was trained by [[Gwillon]] on Low Street in her youth. In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Tzigone caught a young urchin who attempted to pickpocket her. Instead of turning him in, she gave his an [[electrum]] [[Skie (currency)|skie]] and and instructed him to find her old teacher who was always in need of apprentices.
