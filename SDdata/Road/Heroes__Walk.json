        "mainbody": "Heroes Walk was a cobblestone, U-shaped street that encircled Heroes Garden in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep.\nThis street both began and terminated at Trollkill Street, forming with it a ring around Heroes Garden.\nOn its eastern side, Heroes Walk was a terminus to Phastal Street and Staghunters Way.Map 5 of the City System sourcebook, as seen in the infobox, as well as the City of Splendors poster map display the street Staghunters Way as connecting to Heroes Walk. In addition, the Realms by Night article [http//web.archive.org/web/20040917064917/http//www.wizards.com/ForgottenRealms/DnD_RBN_007.asp Kahla the Ghost of Heroes Garden] states that Selchouns Sundries Shop is located on Staghunters Way. The map from Waterdeep Dragon Heist incorrectly shows the Street of Glances as continuing on to Heroes Walk. The road then went on to act as a terminus on its southwestern end to Ivory Street, on its southern end to Mendever Street, and on its southeastern end to Skulls Street.\nEvery year during the summer, Heroes Garden and Heroes Walk were both overtaken by the nobles of the Church of Siamorphe on their holy day, the Divine Pageantry.\n* Heroes Garden\n* Tower of Yintros, a school of wizardry that from 1066 DR to 1306 DR occupied the space that would later be taken by the Heroes Garden."
