Reef Street was a beautiful residential street in Khaerbaal, a port city of Halruaa.
Reef Street was built far inland away from the shores of the Great Sea. Despite that fact, the street strongly smelled of the sea. Numerous aqueducts were erected along the street, carrying seawater via wondrous water pumps built by Khaerbaals artificer guild. All buildings on the street belonged to the upper and middle-class citizens of the city. Buildings on Reef Street were molded from living corals through time, money, effort, and magic. The buildings color varied from sandy pink to a deep rose.
Each coral building was slowly grown over the course of several years. The first thing placed was the buildings "skeleton," made out of magically reinforced wood. Next, water was pumped on the top of the building frame, along with a small portal that attracted tiny coral creatures. They were tricked into building corals on the "skeleton" frame. The forming of coral started at the top and moved down. As the building was created, a cistern of water at the bottom of the frame collected trickling seawater and pumped it back up. once the building was complete, cistern was removed.
Corals were not the only aquatic feature of Reef Street. Walls and iron fences were decorated in wave-like marine designs. Abundant topiaries were trimmed in shapes of various fish, merfolk, and other aquatic creatures. One of the bigger shops on the street had massive gates that were carved depicting a duo of intimidating-looking sahuagin wielding tridents.
Another shop with a sea-green awning found on Reef Street dealt in expensive enchanted weapons. Each item was protected by numerous dweomers that warded the stores goods from theft.
A big walled public park stood on Reef Street with a massive bilboa tree that dwarfed most buildings on it and on the neighboring Sultan Street.
