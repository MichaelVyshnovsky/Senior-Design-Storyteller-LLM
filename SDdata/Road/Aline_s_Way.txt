'''Aline's Way''' was minor avenue of hard-packed earth and [[gravel]] in the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Location==
This alleyway ran southeast, extending off of [[Ship Street (Waterdeep)|Ship Street]], until eventually turning northeast and terminating into [[Keel Alley]].

==Notable Locations==
* This alleyway ran along the backside of the [[Arnagus the Shipwright's residence|shipwright shed]] of [[Arnagus]].
* At the mouth of Aline's Way, where it met with Keel Alley, there was a [[moon]]-shaped stone set into the ground that if activated would act as a ''[[portal]]'' to [[Maldiglas's Refuge]].<ref>
