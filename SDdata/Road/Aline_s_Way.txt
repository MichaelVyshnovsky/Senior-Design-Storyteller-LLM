Alines Way was minor avenue of hard-packed earth and gravel in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.
This alleyway ran southeast, extending off of Ship Street, until eventually turning northeast and terminating into Keel Alley.
* This alleyway ran along the backside of the shipwright shed of Arnagus.
* At the mouth of Alines Way, where it met with Keel Alley, there was a moon-shaped stone set into the ground that if activated would act as a portal to Maldiglass Refuge.
