Howling Cat Court was a small courtyard in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep.
This courtyard extended north off of Mulgomirs Way. It was situated in the block of buildings bounded by the Street of Silks and the Street of Silver.
On one occasion, a dozen furious and heavily armed minotaurs were released from stasis on this street by an evil mage.
Howling Cat Court was a hotbed of felonious activity. In addition to thieves often lurking around it, the court was infamous for being a clandestine meeting place among street gangs or prostitutes and their clients. Because of this reputation, Howling Cat Court was frequently visited by Watch patrols of triple the normal strength.
