The Dragon Trail was a route in the East Reaches of Cormyr connecting the Moonsea Ride to the town of Hillmarch and then to the East Way. It ran along the southern foothills of the Gnoll Peaks.
The defensive fortification of Slingdyke overlooked the westernmost point of the trail. As of 1368 DR, an inn used to sit at the northeastern point of the trail intersection, across from the fort, but a mysterious royal degree forbade the rebuilding of the place after it burned down. A Purple Dragon guard station was erected to the east of the ruins.
Across the trail from the ruined inn were its old paddock and stables&mdashcomplete with a horse pond&mdashwhich were later used as a free campground for travelers.
