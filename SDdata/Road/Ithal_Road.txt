==Description==
The road from Zazesspur was well-kept and easy to travel on, but&mdash;at least during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum|Interregnum]]&mdash;it was preyed on by bandits.

In Darromar, the road divided the city north to south, while the [[River Ith]], which was crossed at the [[Ithal Bridge]], divided the city east to west. Two large markets, the [[Queen's Market]] and the [[Wheel Market]] were located west and east of the road, respectively.<ref name=LoI1:T-p85/>

In the east of Tethyr, the road split at the fortress of [[Barakmordin]] with separate forks leading to Saradush and Ithal Pass.<ref name=LoI1:T-p90/>

==History==
The Ithal Road was completed during the time of the [[Shoon Imperium]] under the leadership of the vassal kings of Tethyr.<ref name=LoI1:T-p29><ref name=LoI2:A-p17><ref group="note">The road may have expanded upon the earlier military road, begun in {{Yearlink|-1300}} and completed in {{Yearlink|-1130}}, that stretched from [[Zazesspur]] to [[Akkabbel]]/[[Ithal Pass]].
