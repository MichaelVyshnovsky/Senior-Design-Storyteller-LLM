'''Sairnor Street''' was an angled backstreet in the walled town of [[Mosstone]] that stood along the [[Trade Way]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Geography==
Sairnor Street merged with the southern end of the [[Fallowfern Lane]] at a steep angle forming the distinct address where [[Taluth's Shrewd Flight]], an artery store, could be found. Another location of some note that stood on the crossing of the two streets was a forgettable hot-bun shop.
