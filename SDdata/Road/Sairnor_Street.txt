Sairnor Street was an angled backstreet in the walled town of Mosstone that stood along the Trade Way in Tethyr.
Sairnor Street merged with the southern end of the Fallowfern Lane at a steep angle forming the distinct address where Taluths Shrewd Flight, an artery store, could be found. Another location of some note that stood on the crossing of the two streets was a forgettable hot-bun shop.
