Landleen Lane was a road that crossed the entirety of the Shutters neighborhood in the Crows End District of Ravens Bluff from north to south, and ended in the Pumpside neighborhood.
Landleen Lane was only five city blocks in length. It began at Karen Court in the Shutters to the north, moved straight south, crossing Hammerstone Street, Drovers Run, came to a moot with Samarglast Lane and the Conant Court, passed Kalikoolan Lane and turned west, becoming Stonekeep End on the edge of Pumpside.
