'''Hael Way''' was a main thoroughfare in the city of [[Khôltar]] in [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|67}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 53: Khôltar, Part 4, Our Tour Begins}}

==Description==
Hael Way was three times as wide as a typical street in Khôltar and paved with cobblestones. It connected the south gate (named Farrgaunlar) to the west gate (named Dubrinlar) and was one leg of the triangle of roads connecting all three city gates. Hael Way intersected with the [[North Way]] at Farrgaunlar, and with [[Orntathtar Way]] at Dubrinlar.

==History==
This street was named after [[Ulbrask Hael]] who, in the [[368 DR|Year of the Bitter Smile, 368 DR]], designed a new heavy wagon that was strong, durable, and easily repairable. This invention catapulted the city into prominent status as a major trade center.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|83}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 63: Khôltar, Part 14, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 1}} The final gates of Khôltar were constructed during the tenure of Shieldlord [[Angloam Dubrin]] ([[577 DR|Year of the Alabaster Mounds, 577 DR]], to the [[619 DR|Year of Orcsfall, 619 DR]]) so Hael Way was also completed during this period.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|85-86}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 65: Khôltar, Part 16, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 3}}
