        "mainbody": "croll Street, originally known as Bendulph’s Lane, was a hard-packed dirt and gravel paved\nThis street ran east off of Snail Street, then curved northward until it terminated on the High Road. Along the way, it was intersected by Atkiss Alley.\nScroll Street began as a cul-de-sac of five buildings, built sometime around the 1200s DR by someone named Bendulph, atop of what had originally been a stockyard paddock they owned. These buildings were all rented out, with most of the ground-floor shops being taken up by scribes. These scribes lived above the shops and hired underscribes to work for them at very low wages, throwing in room and board for the rooms other rooms above the shops.\nOver time, Bendulph’s Lane became the locale of choice for those seeking out scribes to hire, earning it the moniker of Scroll Street. It would go on to attract bookbinders and mapmakers as renters.\nOne of the more interesting moments to occur on the street in its history was an incident later referred to as the Shatterbone Fray.\nHouse of Light Guildhall of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters.\nScroll Street was heavily populated by scribes, who earned most of their coin as copyists for daily mercantile trade, as well as comparatively wealthier bookbinders and mapmakers. The scribes possession of spell scrolls as investments floated around as a rumor, with it being said they would sell them at exorbitant prices to the desperate.\nAnother persistent, though ultimately true, rumor circulating around Scroll Street was that doppelgangers lived among its scribes. These creatures were spies of the Xanathars Thieves Guild, whose duty was to keep an eye on two expert forgers that lived on the street and to be on the lookout for anyone trying to begin a business venture of selling spell scrolls."
