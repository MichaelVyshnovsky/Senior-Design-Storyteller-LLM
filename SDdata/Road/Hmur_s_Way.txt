'''Hmur's Way''' was the sole major clear roadway in the underwater city of [[Myth Nantar]].{{cite book/Sea of Fallen Stars|173}}

==Etymology==
Hmur's Way was most likely named for [[Hmur]], a mythical figure among the [[merfolk]] of [[Ser√¥s]] that was said to have been the first of them created by [[Eadro]] and the namesake of the [[Hmur Plateau]].<ref>{{cite book/Sea of Fallen Stars|139}}

==Location==
This road was paved in [[blaze coral]] and depicted mosaics that over time broke down in appearance. Like the other major roadways of Myth Nantar, it measured {{SI|30|ft|long=yes}} in width. It spanned west from the lowest slope of [[Mount Halaath]] to the [[Fire Fountain]] at the city's central square.
