The '''Ilinvur Trail''', also spelled as the '''Ilinver Trail''',{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}} was a winding path that ran through the lands north of the [[Moonsea]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}

==Geography==
The trail began at [[Castle Vathar]] and headed northwards past [[Lake Longreach]], passed over a bridge at Need Creek, and then crossed open country until it reached the village of [[Ilinvur]]. Once there, the trail met with the [[Way of the Powrie]] trail heading north, and an eastbound trail that led to [[Avang]] (in the near edge of [[Vaasa]]). Not far south from the village, another trail (the [[North Glister Path]]) branched off in a southeasterly direction, running along the southern edge of the [[West Galena Mountains]], heading towards [[Glister]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}
