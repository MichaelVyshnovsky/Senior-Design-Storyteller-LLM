The Ilinvur Trail, also spelled as the Ilinver Trail, was a winding path that ran through the lands north of the Moonsea.
The trail began at Castle Vathar and headed northwards past Lake Longreach, passed over a bridge at Need Creek, and then crossed open country until it reached the village of Ilinvur. Once there, the trail met with the Way of the Powrie trail heading north, and an eastbound trail that led to Avang (in the near edge of Vaasa). Not far south from the village, another trail (the North Glister Path) branched off in a southeasterly direction, running along the southern edge of the West Galena Mountains, heading towards Glister.
