        "mainbody": "Melinters Court was a small courtyard that was located in the city of Waterdeep.\nThis dark courtyard was often engulfed with pipesmoke from curbside philosophers.\nMelinters Court was located in Waterdeeps Dock Ward. The buildings forming the court were enclosed by Snail Street to the southwest and northwest, and by Net Street to the southeast. The courtyards main entry point was from an unnamed alley to the north.\nThe court was named for a wicked mage who met his gang here during the 1350s DR to plan their villainies. Melinters apprentices still met at the courtyard after his death to discuss their plans. They would put any loitering citizens to sleep with their magic. \nThe rear face of the Hanged Man tavern faced Melinters Court."
