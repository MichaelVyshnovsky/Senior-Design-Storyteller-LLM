This street ran southeast from the [[Place of Banners]] (a large open area in the center of Daerlun that contained the seat of government, [[Bergun Hall]]), to the southern gate out of the city known as the Sea Arch. There, it connected to the road to [[Urmlaspyr]]. About a third of the way from the Sea Arch to the Place of Banners, [[Saurovin Street]] branched off to the east-northeast and headed to the [[Westmarket]].{{Cite dragon/287/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Shadowdark House|70}}"
