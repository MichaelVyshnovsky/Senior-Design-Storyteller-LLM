Aldevers Street was a major road in Luskans South Bank. 
Aldevers Street began at the south wall of the city at Captains Court, which sat on the north side of the road opposite the Hall of Warriors temple. It ran northwest to Captains Close, where it intersected the Darkwalk. It then turned north between Captains Close on the east side and the Ruins of Illusk on the west before ending at the city market. The road continued eastward as Setting Sun Street.
As of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Aldevers Street was a notably safe road by Luskans standards, owing to the Luskanite soldiers standing guard at Captains Court and the Hall of Warriors. Whenever Luskan mustered for war, Aldevers Street was the site of soldiers marching in formation as they made their way to the temple for mandatory prayers to Tempus.
