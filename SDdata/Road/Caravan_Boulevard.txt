The Caravan Boulevard, also known as the Ghosts Route or the East Gate Road, was located in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
The Caravan Boulevard was actually the beginning or end of the Dihl al-Taif trade route, depending on which way a caravan was headed. The Caravan Boulevard entered and exited Huzuz through the East Gate on the eastern wall, passing southwest through the city. It served as the main boundary between the Craft District and East District before it terminated within the Pilgrims District and Court District near the heart of the city.
