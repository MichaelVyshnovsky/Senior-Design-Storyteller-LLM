The '''Caravan Boulevard''', also known as the '''Ghost's Route''' or the '''East Gate Road''', was located in [[Huzuz]], the City of Delights, in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
The Caravan Boulevard was actually the beginning or end of the [[Dihl al-Taif]] trade route, depending on which way a caravan was headed. The Caravan Boulevard entered and exited Huzuz through the [[East Gate (Huzuz)|East Gate]] on the eastern wall, passing southwest through the city. It served as the main boundary between the [[Craft District]] and [[East District]] before it terminated within the [[Pilgrims' District]] and [[Court District]] near the heart of the city.
