Dretch Lane
Rainrun Street was a road paved in gravel and hard packed dirt
This road ran west off of Snail Street and eventually terminated on Wards Way. Along the way to that destination, it was intersected by Belnimbras Street and Cook Street.
Prior to the mid-14 century DR, this road continued on beyond Wards Way and terminated on Dretch Lane, however, a house was eventually constructed along Wards Way that cut off the roads access.
