'''Rainrun Street''' was a road paved in gravel and hard packed dirt

==Geography==
This road ran west off of [[Snail Street]] and eventually terminated on [[Ward's Way]]. Along the way to that destination, it was intersected by [[Belnimbra's Street]] and [[Cook Street]].

Prior to the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], this road continued on beyond Ward's Way and terminated on [[Dretch Lane]], however, a house was eventually constructed along Ward's Way that cut off the road's access.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Yawning Portal]]
* [[The Empty Keg]]
* [[Mother Salinka's House of Pleasure]]
