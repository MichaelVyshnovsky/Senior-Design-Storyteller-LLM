Spindle Street was a lesser avenue, paved in corduroy-logs, in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.
This street ran from north to south, running off of Selduth Street and trailing down south until it terminated on Coffinmarch.
In the late 14 century DR, over the course of a tenday and more, streets across the Trades Ward experienced a number of ghostly sightings. In and around Coffinmarch and Spindle Street in particular, Waterdhavians reported a floating head peering in at windows by day and pursuing during the night.
These sightings left many citizens, scribes, and members of the City Watch confused and some speculated if a wizard experimenting with illusions may have been the cause.
