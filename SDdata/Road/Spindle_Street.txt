'''Spindle Street''' was a lesser avenue, paved in corduroy-logs, in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Geography==
This street ran from north to south, running off of [[Selduth Street]] and trailing down south until it terminated on [[Coffinmarch]].

==History==
In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], over the course of a [[tenday]] and more, streets across the Trades Ward experienced a number of [[ghost]]ly sightings. In and around Coffinmarch and Spindle Street in particular, Waterdhavians reported a floating head peering in at windows by day and pursuing during the night.{{Cite web/Waterdeep News/Ghost Sightings}}

These sightings left many citizens, scribes, and members of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] confused and some speculated if a [[wizard]] experimenting with [[illusion]]s may have been the cause.
