Beholder Street was a large road located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Beholder Street was located in east Zhentil Keep in the Common Quarter.

Along the way Beholder Street was crossed by the Street of Swords, Dusk Street, Traders Way, Realm Street, Ale Street, and Moonsea Avenue.
Prominent locations along Beholder Street included the Four Dwarf Miners, the Gorey Eye-Beast, the Serpents Eye, and a barracks for the Zhentilar.
