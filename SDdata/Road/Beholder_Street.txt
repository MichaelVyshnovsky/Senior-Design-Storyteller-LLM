Beholder Street was a large road located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Beholder Street was located in east Zhentil Keep in the Common Quarter. The road originated where the Street of Dragons met the wall of the Inner Quarter in the north, then passed south through the city before terminating in the southeast corner. Along the way Beholder Street was crossed by the Street of Swords, Dusk Street, Traders Way, Realm Street, Ale Street, and Moonsea Avenue.
Prominent locations along Beholder Street included the Four Dwarf Miners, the Gorey Eye-Beast, the Serpents Eye, and a barracks for the Zhentilar.
