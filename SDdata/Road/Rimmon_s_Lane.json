The Lane stretched into the busy area beyond the city walls, always chuck-full of caravaners, repairmen who serviced the caravan wagons, foresters, travelers, and various outsiders.\n* Drovers Field the enclosure for the caravaners oxen and other grazing creatures to be held while the guests and traders conducted business in Mosstone or rested overnight. The field was guarded against hungry wildlife and connected to Rimmons Lane and the city gate.\n* Drovers Last Drink an in-and-out tavern just outside the city, notable for the lack of walls and always packed with travelers."
