        "mainbody": "'''Rimmon's Lane''' was a road in [[Mosstone]] that connected the northern city gate and the [[Drovers' Field]] on the north-eastern side of the town.",
        "Geography": "Rimmon's Lane's main purpose was assembling and dispersing the caravans that moved through the town of Mosstone via the long [[Trade Way]] that went through the green-filled settlement. The Lane stretched into the busy area beyond the city walls, always chuck-full of caravaners, repairmen who serviced the caravan wagons, foresters, travelers, and various outsiders.",
        "Notable locations": "* Drovers' Field: the enclosure for the caravaners' [[ox]]en and other grazing creatures to be held while the guests and traders conducted business in Mosstone or rested overnight. The field was guarded against hungry wildlife and connected to Rimmon's Lane and the city gate.\n* [[Drover's Last Drink]]: an in-and-out tavern just outside the city, notable for the lack of walls and always packed with travelers."
