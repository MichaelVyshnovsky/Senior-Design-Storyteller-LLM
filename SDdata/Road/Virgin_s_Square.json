        "mainbody": "Virgins Square was a prominent, cobblestone paved,\nDespite its name, Virgins Square had a roughly round shape to it.\nThis courtyard was located in the center of a block of buildings bounded by the High Road, Scroll Street, Simples Street, Snail Street, and the Way of the Dragon. Most of it opened southward on to Simples Street, but it could also be entered from the north through Atkiss Alley.\nVirgins Square acted as a marketplace, Fully armed and often sinister looking, these mercenaries originated from all across Faer√ªn. Many of them spoke out and advertised their abilities or skills, some even approaching known mercenary contacts.\nWaterdhavian citizenry often lingered in Virgins Square to watch the boastful warriors, with women often giving them dirty looks, or to watch the constant traffic from the nearby main avenues, the High Road and the Way of the Dragon.\nVirgins Square was named for a local legend that claimed long before Waterdeeps founding, the spot the square stood on was used by nomadic barbarian tribes to sacrifice virgins, both male and female, to dragons. In later centuries, Virgins Square would become a traditional meeting place for members of the Cult of the Dragon.\nOne of the more notable incidences to occur in Virgins Square was when a mimic took up the share of a statue in the courtyard, shoving the real statue in a nearby sewers entrance that had a depth of . The mimic lingered there for two winters undetected, preying upon drunkards every night and heaping their bones atop the real statue.\nEventually the nightly disappearances prompted an investigation by the City Watch. Not expecting to find anything amiss, two Watchmen prodded the mimic with their spears, who retaliated by devouring them. After this, the Watch found that the statues sculptor did not recognize it and discovered the hiding place of the real statue, along with the huge heap of bones that had been amassed atop it.\nIn the late 14 century DR, over the course of a tenday and more, streets across the Trades Ward experienced a number of ghostly sightings. These left many citizens, scribes, and members of the City Watch confused and some speculated if a wizard experimenting with illusions may have been the cause. In response to the incidences, the Lathanderite priest Thalomaun gave a speech on Virgins Square, wherein he claimed that these were a sign from the dead that it was time for the living of the affected neighborhoods to do away with old businesses and make way for new ones.\nMost days, Blazidon One-Eye could be found in this courtyard sitting on a crate or stool,  the veteran warrior acting as a mercenary contract. In return for a small fee, he matched hireswords with caravan masters or others in need of such services.\nVirgins Square was considered to be one of the landmarks of the Trades Ward.\nIn the 14 century DR, some barbarian tribes on the Sword Coast were noted as refraining from raiding Waterdeep due to having legends of a Dragon God. According their legends, if the dragons that laired on Mount Waterdeep were to see them, the dragons would come to devour all their tribesmen for their ancestors having ceased their sacrifices."
