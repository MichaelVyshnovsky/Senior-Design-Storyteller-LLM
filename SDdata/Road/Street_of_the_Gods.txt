The Street of the Gods was a road located in the city of Zhentil Keep during the midâ€“14 century DR.
Located in the Inner Quarter in central Zhentil Keep, the Street of the Gods cut north to south, touching the wall of the Common Quarter and ending south Elephstron Way. Along the way, the Street of the Gods was crossed by Gold Street and the Lords Way.
