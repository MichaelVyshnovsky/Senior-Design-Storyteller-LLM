Raelrurs Run was a side street in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
Raelrurs Run began at the North Way very close to Farrgaunlar (the southern gate into Khôltar) and headed east until it reached the unnamed road just inside the wall that circled the city and connected all the guard towers. Upon entering Farrgaunlar, Darvoros Plates was the first building to the right (east), then came Raelrurs Run, and then Pauntraal, the garthraun (police) headquarters and duty house. Turning down Raelrurs Run, there were guarded warehouses along most of its length until the last building on the left (north) Mother Talaskos.
Locations on Raelrurs Run included
* Mother Talaskos A low-class blurdren (food counter) with good stew.
* Pauntraal The garthraun HQ and guard tower for Farrgaunlar.
* Darvoros Plates A successful metal plate manufacturer.
