        "mainbody": "In the Candlekeep forums compilation of Ed Greenwoods lore, Stormshore Street is sad to run across the city, beginning by Stormkeep. However, published maps do not have a continuous street that stretches across the city while passing through location #11 indicated in Volos Guide to the Sword Coast. The same book also states that Stormshore Street passes Sorcerous Sundries, and, in Murder in Baldurs Gate and Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus, it is stated that Low Lantern is located on Stormshore Street and a city dock that bore the same name as Stormshore Street. According to the published sources, Stormshore Street had a dramatically curved shape.\nStormshore Street was a bow-shaped street that ran across Heapside and Brampton districts of Baldurs Gate.\nStormshore Street began on the northernmost part of the Gray Harbor, where the Eastern Wet ran alongside the riverside docks. and moved towards the citys eastern walls, passing Sorcerous Sundries and the Murls Rest plaza in front of it.\n*Sorcerous Sundries, a domed magic shop located on Murls Rest strake, owned by Halbazzer Drin in the 14 century DR.\n*Splurging Sturgeon, an inn and eatery that specialized in seafood in the 14 and 15 centuries DR.\n*Keexie Tavern, a tavern used as a front for Baldurs Gates thieves guild in the 14 century DR, located on Stormshore Streets bend south.\n*Well-Adjusted Als General Store, a 14 century general store across the street from the Low Lantern.\n*Low Lantern, a three-mast ship converted to be a festhall, tavern, and gambling house, permanently docked at the Stormshore Street Dock."
