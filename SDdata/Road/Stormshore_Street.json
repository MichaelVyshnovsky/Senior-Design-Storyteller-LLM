However, published maps do not have a continuous street that stretches across the city while passing through location #11 indicated in ''[[Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast]]''. The same book also states that Stormshore Street passes Sorcerous Sundries, and, in ''[[Murder in Baldur's Gate]]'' and ''[[Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus]]'', it is stated that Low Lantern is located on Stormshore Street and a city dock that bore the same name as Stormshore Street. According to the published sources, Stormshore Street had a dramatically curved shape.",
