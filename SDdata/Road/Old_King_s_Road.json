        "Geography": "The first stretch of the road headed north from Valls in the [[Duchy of Arcata]] across dusty plains to the foothills of the [[Galena Mountains]], and the second stretch entered the mountains at Bloodstone Pass in the [[Barony of Bloodstone]]. From there, it became a narrow and winding trail that passed directly through the [[Damaran Gate]] before joining into the main road through [[Bloodstone Valley]] to [[Bloodstone Village]].\n\nAs of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the route was fairly direct and overland, passing through varied terrain including small woodlands and rocky crevasses.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}",
        "History": "The overland trade route through Bloodstone Pass declined in relevance in the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century DR, and by the 1350s DR the stretch of the King's Road leading to the Pass was in ruins,\n\nFollowing the victory of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] over the forces of Damara in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the road between Bloodstone and Valls became a thoroughfare for refugees fleeing south from the Witch-King's territory, and on their heels were violent groups of bandits and displaced soldiers. to keep the road safe.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, the [[Bloodstone Wars]] began when Arcatan forces marched along the old King's Road to Bloodstone Pass with the intent of besieging Bloodstone Village and seizing [[Bloodstone Mines]].",
        "Inhabitants": "While a number of bandits prowled the road during the reign of Zhengyi, the greater threat was a mated pair of [[red dragon]]s and their [[wyrmling]] who made their lair just off the road in a wooded area."
