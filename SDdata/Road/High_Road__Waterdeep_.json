        "mainbody": "he High Road, largely known to citizens as just the High, was one of the main streets of Waterdeep, connecting its southern and northern regions. Together with the other boulevards that ran through the city in the north-south direction, it was heavily trafficked, and one of the main routes of the citys drays and hire-coaches.\nThe High Road started at the South Gate of Waterdeep, where it continued south as the Trade Way. From there it led northward, crossing the city and exiting it from the North Gate, from where it continued north along the Sword Coast North as the road of the same name.\nIn southern Waterdeep, the intersection between the High Road and the Way of the Dragon was known as the Waymoot. A magic signpost at the center of the intersection indicated the direction and distance to locations outside the city. Berendarrs World of Words, a broadsheet store, was located here."
