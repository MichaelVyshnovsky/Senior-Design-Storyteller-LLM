'''Imnescourse Trail''' was a roadway that ran across central [[Amn]]. The western most point of the trail was at the town of [[Imnescar]] where it met with the [[Trade Way]], then it ran east, along the edge of the [[Umar Hills]] through the town of Gambiton, linking with the South Road, before turning north and ending at the city of [[Esmeltaran]]. 

==Realmslore==
The section of the Imnescourse Trail that runs though the Umar Hills was very dangerous. The area was full of [[wolves]] and possibly a [[werewolf]].
