The '''Hunt Bide''' was a street in [[Suzail]], the capital of [[Cormyr]], that stretched from [[Promenade (Suzail)|the Promenade]] to the  city's commercial deepwater harbor called [[the Basin]].

==Description==
The Hunt Bide began on the corner where [[the Six Candles]] stood on the grand Promenade of Suzail. From there, the street moved one block southwest and immediately passed the [[Leaning Post]] inn and [[Garth Street]], before the Bide angled southeast and ended on the street that bordered the northern side of the Basin.

===Notable Locations===
* [[Tathlin's Discreet Errands]], a small message runners' business that stood on the southwestern side of the Hunt Bide and Garth Street crossing.
* Rental lodgings, in a tollhouse next door and south of Tathlin's, that was a temporary home of [[Amarune Whitewave]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
