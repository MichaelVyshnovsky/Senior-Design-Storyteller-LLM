        "Geography": "This road ran east off of the [[Way of the Dragon (Waterdeep)|Way of the Dragon]], ending in a deadend in the block of buildings that stood between Way of the Dragon and the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]]. In the center of the alleyway, it was the northern terminus of [[Burdag Lane]].",
        "History": "Blackhorn Alley was named for a cobbler that once lived on it, [[Alsible Blackhorn]]. Long after his death, by 1360's [[DR]], it became a frequent haunt of brown [[giant rat]]s.<ref> Some of the more destitute Waterdhavians were known to go after these rats with [[club]]s or the alley's empty crates, viewing them as an easy meal."
