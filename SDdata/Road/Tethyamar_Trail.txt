The Tethyamar Trail was a trade road that ran the length of Daggerdale. Locally, it was often referred to as the Daggerdale road.
The Tethyamar Trail started a few miles east of the southern point of Spiderhaunt Wood at the North Ride. It traveled north through the rolling hills of Daggerdale all the way to the town of Dagger Falls, where it joined the Tesh Trail.
