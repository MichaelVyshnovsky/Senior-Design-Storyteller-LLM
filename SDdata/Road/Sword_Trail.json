        "mainbody": "The Sword Trail was a traveling route that spanned a stretch of the northern coast of the Moonsea lake in north Faer√ªn.\nUnlike the adjacent Phlan Path, this road was like many trails in the region in that it was fairly under-developed as of the late 14 century DR.\nThe trail originated in the city-state of Melvaunt and followed the coast southeast, passing over the River Thent until it reached the independent city of Thentia."
