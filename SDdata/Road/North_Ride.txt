The '''North Ride''', alternate spelling '''Northride''', was a road that ran north from [[Tilverton]] through the [[Shadow Gap]] to the [[Dalelands]]. It crossed the [[River Ashaba]] at the [[Shadowdale (town)|town of Shadowdale]], passing through to [[Voonlar]] and the [[Moonsea]] region.

==History==
Guards from Shadowdale would regularly patrol their stretch of this road in [[1369 DR]]. Also around this time, an adventuring party called the [[Initiates of the Sacred Order]] could regularly be found here.
