The North Ride, alternate spelling Northride, was a road that ran north from Tilverton through the Shadow Gap to the Dalelands. It crossed the River Ashaba at the town of Shadowdale, passing through to Voonlar and the Moonsea region.
Guards from Shadowdale would regularly patrol their stretch of this road in 1369 DR. Also around this time, an adventuring party called the Initiates of the Sacred Order could regularly be found here.
