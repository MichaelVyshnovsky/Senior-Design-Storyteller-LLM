        "mainbody": "Deloun Alley was an alleyway of hard-packed dirt and gravel in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.\nThis alleyway was heavily crowded with barrels, crates, and the like.\nThis alleyway ran due southwest off of the Wide Way, then turned eastward and terminated on a nameless alley. Along the way to that destination, Deloun Alley acted as the western terminus of Chelors Alley.\nDuring daylight hours, Deloun Alley was most frequently used as a delivery route for the backs of shops. But during the night, the alley became home to both rats and wererats, acting as an informal meeting place for members of the Plague Rats. The members of this criminal organization were likely to topple the barrels and crates in the alley, having them fall onto victims or block their escape.\nGentle Rest Stables A stable business that worked in conjunction with the nearby Gentle Rest tavern."
