The Gap of Skulls was one of two paths across the Scimitar Spires in the Anauroch desert.
The Scimitar Spires was a mountain chain to the east from the Shoal of Thirst, with the Gap of Skulls, along with the Road of Jackals being the two known passages across. The Gap of Skulls was the northernmost of them.
