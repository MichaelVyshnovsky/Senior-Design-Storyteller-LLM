        "Geography": "Zeldazar Street began at the [[Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility]], where it met with [[Red Sails Way]]. Unlike the streets that ran parallel to Zeldazar, it did not stretch to the [[Fire River]], being cut short by one city block. From there, Zeldazar ran in a straight line south, crossing [[Drover's Run]], [[Conant Court]], [[Grismort Lane]] (which ended at Zeldazar Street), and ended at [[Stonekeep End]], where rooming houses stood at the border with a forested area. [[Samarglast Lane]] formed a moot with Zeldazar and Stonekeep End where Zeldazar came to an end.",
        "Notable Locations": "*[[Burnhart's Outfitting]], located where Zeldazar Street and Conant Court met, was a shop that dealt in traveling caravan gear and supplies, run by [[Frek Burnhart]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n*[[Magestrand Manor]], a manse on Zeldazar Street and Samarglast Lane, was home to [[Oracle (Ravens Bluff)|Oracle]], a one-time Minister of Divination of Ravens Bluff.\n*[[Ravens Bluff Sanitation Facility]], which replaced a smelly junkyard, on Zeldazar Street and the western end of Hammerstone Street."
