Tsarnen Alley was a short, hard-packed dirt and gravel paved, alleyway in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep. It was frequently walked down by pilgrims and priests on their way to the Plinth.
This alleyway ran in a straight line east from the Way of the Dragon and terminated on the west side of Burdag Lane.
Long before the 14 century DR, traffic on this alley was often preyed upon by thieves, until one day in the summer of 1297 DR a ranger by the name of Tsarnen made it his duty to eliminate thieves in an unpleasant manner.
In the 14 century DR, with Tsarnen having long passed away, the alleyway received a small degree of thief activity. But the growth of greater thievery was discouraged by Watch patrols.
An entrance to the sewers of Waterdeep could be found on the intersection of Burdag Lane and Tsarnen Alley.
Some claimed that the ghost of Tsarnen watched over the alleyway, while others claimed that Tsarnen Alley was haunted by the spirits of thieves that had been slain on it.
