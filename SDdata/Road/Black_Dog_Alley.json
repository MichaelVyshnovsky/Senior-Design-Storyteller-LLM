        "mainbody": "lack Dog Alley was an alley in the North Ward of Waterdeep.\nThe alley was a loop inside the southern part of a city block in the northeastern corner of the North Ward, delimited by Tower March to the north, the Trollmarch to the east, Stallion Street to the south, and Immar Street to the west. The northern access point to Black Dog Alley was another looping alley known as Watch Alley. Other access points existed from the Trollmarch and Immar Street as well.\nThe alley was named after the silent ghost of a black dog that could frequently be seen roaming the alley at night. The dog, which was as tall as a goat, wore a spiked collar and had flaming red eyes. It ignored people and objects, just walking past or through them.\n*Sunrise Tower, or more colloquially known as the \"Mad Tower\" â€“ an asylum for persons of addled or sick mind open in the 15 century DR.\nLike most alleys in the North Ward, Black Dog Alley was very safe. It was frequented by the occasional drunk who wanted to sleep undisturbed, as well as lone lantern guides. It was considered safe enough for children to play unattended during nights of the full moon."
