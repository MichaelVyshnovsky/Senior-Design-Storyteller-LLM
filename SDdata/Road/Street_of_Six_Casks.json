Over time the family lines of two of these businesses died out, while another two were bought out by their rivals. One of the bought out businesses moved elsewhere into the North Ward, while the other shut down completely.\nIn the 1350s DR, during a brief period in which one could purchase the naming rights to streets from city clerks, a wealthy individual purchased the naming rights to the Street of Six Casks and had it renamed to Harings Way. When this brief period ended, this street and others like it had their previous names restored.\n* Burnleirs Barrels, one of the streets two surviving cooper businesses.
