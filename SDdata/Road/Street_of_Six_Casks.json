        "Location": "This road ran from northwest to southeast, stretching between [[Presper Street]] and [[Shrimp Alley]], formerly known as Shrimp Street.",
        "History": "This street earned its moniker of \"Six Casks\" due to it having once been fronted by six competing cooper ([[barrel]]-making) businesses. Over time the family lines of two of these businesses died out, while another two were bought out by their rivals. One of the bought out businesses moved elsewhere into the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]], while the other shut down completely.\n\nIn the 1350's [[DR]], during a brief period in which one could purchase the naming rights to streets from city clerks, a wealthy individual purchased the naming rights to the Street of Six Casks and had it renamed to Haring's Way. When this brief period ended, this street and others like it had their previous names restored.",
        "Notable Locations": "* [[Burnleir's Barrels]], one of the street's two surviving cooper businesses. It fronted the street from the west and was four doors south of Presper Street.\n* [[Lithandy Fine Casks]], one of the street's two surviving cooper businesses. It fronted the street from the west and was two doors south of Presper Street."
