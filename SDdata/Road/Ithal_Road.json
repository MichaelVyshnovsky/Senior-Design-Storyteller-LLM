It also passed through the center of Darromar, the capital of Tethyr, within which it was called Star Street. The stretch between Darromar and Zazesspur was called the Zazesspur Road. It was one of the only two major east&ndashwest routes in Tethyr, (the other being the Tethir Road.)\nThe road from Zazesspur was well-kept and easy to travel on, but&mdashat least during the Interregnum&mdashit was preyed on by bandits.\nIn Darromar, the road divided the city north to south, while the River Ith, which was crossed at the Ithal Bridge, divided the city east to west. Two large markets, the Queens Market and the Wheel Market were located west and east of the road, respectively.\nIn the east of Tethyr, the road split at the fortress of Barakmordin with separate forks leading to Saradush and Ithal Pass.\nThe Ithal Road was completed during the time of the Shoon Imperium under the leadership of the vassal kings of Tethyr.The road may have expanded upon the earlier military road, begun in  and completed in , that stretched from Zazesspur to Akkabbel/Ithal Pass."
