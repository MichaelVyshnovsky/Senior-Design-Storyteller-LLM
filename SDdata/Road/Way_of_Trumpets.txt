The '''Way of Trumpets''' was a winding road in the city of [[Yeshpek]].

==Notable Locations==
This road was lined with a number of small chapels that were individually dedicated to [[Church of Helm|Helm]], [[Church of Lathander|Lathander]], [[Church of Loviatar|Loviatar]], and [[Church of Torm|Torm]]. The handful of clergy that operated each chapel was relatively wealthy by [[1370 DR]] and steadily rising in popularity.

==Inhabitants==
The Yeshenites who worshiped Loviatar were known to release their frustrations by flogging her statues on this street, as well as themselves, each other, and [[slavery|slaves]].
