The Way of Trumpets was a winding road in the city of Yeshpek.
This road was lined with a number of small chapels that were individually dedicated to Helm, Lathander, Loviatar, and Torm. The handful of clergy that operated each chapel was relatively wealthy by 1370 DR and steadily rising in popularity.
The Yeshenites who worshiped Loviatar were known to release their frustrations by flogging her statues on this street, as well as themselves, each other, and slaves.
