The '''Thunderhoof Pass''' was a mountain road through the [[Sword Mountains]] connected to the [[Old Owl Well]].

==Geography==
The Thunderhoof Pass began in a small wooded area surrounding the settlement of [[Gnomengarde]] on the Sword Mountains' western side, passed the [[Ash Ridge]], and reached the Old Owl Well.

==History==
Before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Thunderhoof Pass was an important trade way that led to the Old Owl Well. Following the disastrous [[Spellplague]] that ravaged the face of [[Toril]], the Thunderhoof Pass and the Old Owl Well were taken over by the [[orc]]s of the [[Many-Arrows Kingdom]]. Powers of the [[Lords' Alliance]] showed little interest in the mountain pass as the trade withered away. Despite having little strategic value, Lord [[Neverember]] used [[adventurer]]s to claim the Thunderhoof Pass for [[Neverwinter]], with a promise of grand rewards.

==Inhabitants==
Before the orcish occupation, settlements near the Thunderhoof Pass were where the [[Sword Mountains spice cake]]s originated from. In the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Thunderhoof Pass was plagued by orcs of the Many-Arrows and by [[deathjump spider]]s.
