The Dunsel Trail was a trade route that connected the Golden Road at Shaarmid with the human outpost of Khôltar and the dwarven city of Eartheart on the edge of the Great Rift far to the east in south Faerûn.
Starting at Shaarmid, the stone, gravel, and hard mud road headed east across the plains of the Shaar, crossing the River Shaar south of the Shaarwood. Continuing due east, it passed to the north of the Rathgaunt Hills and then climbed the Landrise and started to bend to the south to meet Khôltar. Exiting Khôltar, the Dunsel Trail became a wholly stone road to Eartheart where it joined the Traders Way.
In the Year of the Molten Anvils, 366 DR, Amberu Khôltar, the dwarven adventurer and entrepreneur who founded the settlement that bore his name, and his friend Dunsel, received funds from their brethren in the Rift to facilitate building new walls and roads. Amberu took charge of building the walls and Dunsel began building a fine stone road between Earthfast and Khôltar. During this time, some cynical locals called the project "Dunsels Dream", but the road was eventually finished. Dunsel did not stop there&mdashhe pushed on and managed to connect Khôltar with Shaarmid on the Golden Road approximately 500 miles (800 kilometers) to the west.
