The '''Iron Route''' was a long-standing trade route found in the [[Moonsea North]] region of [[north Faer√ªn]] that ran between the cities of [[Zhentil Keep]] and [[Phlan]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}

==Description==
While its name suggested otherwise, the Iron Route was little more than a hard-trodden trail.{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|13}}

Most of the time, Iron Route was considered to be generally safe by locals, at least by [[Moonsea]] standards.{{Cite adventurers league/Shadows over the Moonsea|12}}

==Geography==
The road ran across a stretch of the northern shore of the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea lake]], spanning the entirety of the [[Stormy Bay]]. It lay just south of the [[Giant's Cairn]] and the untamed steppes of the [[Grass Sea]].

==History==
In the 1480s [[DR]], the [[Gray Patriots]] began carrying out raids beyond their usual targets of rich nobles from Phlan, instead striking against caravans moving along the Iron Route. These raids infringed upon the territory claimed by the [[Claws of Tiamat]], a sect of the reborn [[Cult of the Dragon]] that employed [[kobold]]s for the acts of robbery they committed on the trade route.{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|5}}{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|7}}

==Notable Locations==
* [[King's Pyre]], an {{SIAdj|80|ft|adj=tall|long=yes}} sculpture of a seated king carved into the side of a cliff overlooking the sea.{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|13}}

==Inhabitants==
