        "mainbody": "'''Merchant's Run''', sometimes called '''Merchants Run''' or '''the Merchant's Run''', was a route connecting the realms of [[Damara]] and [[Impiltur]] in the [[Cold Lands]]. It was both the name of the road along this route as well as the name of the narrow gap between the [[Dunwood]] and the [[Earthspur Mountains]] through which the road ran.",
        "Geography": "Merchant's Run ran southeast from the Damaran city of [[Trailsend]], the capital city of the [[Barony of Polten]], to [[Ilmwatch]] in Impiltur on the coast of the [[Easting Reach]]. It thus connected the main road in Damara, the [[King's Road]], with the main road in Impiltur, the [[Herald's Road]].\n\nThe western terminus of the [[Long Road (Northeast Faerûn)|Long Road]] intersected Merchant's Run in Damara just north of the gap between the Earthspurs and the Dunwood.",
        "Defenses": "Within Impiltur's borders, the road was well-patrolled by soldiers from Ilmwatch{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|59-60}} and had fortified settlements at regular intervals at which travelers could spend the night in well-managed [[inn]]s.",
        "History": "Between the founding of Damara in the late 11{{th}} century [[DR]] until the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century DR, the road was a key trade route for merchants bringing [[bloodstone]] from the north to sell to lands further south. Long caravans of merchants loaded with [[gem]]s enjoyed the protection of Impilturan soldiers as they traveled the route before turning south along the Herald's Road to traverse [[Traders Bay]] to arrive at ports like [[Sarshel]].\n\nHowever, this traffic disappeared with the rise of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, and his ensuing [[Vaasan War|decade-long war]] and occupation of Damara. Even after the Witch-King was defeated in the [[Bloodstone Wars]] of the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, trade was initially slow to resume. It was once again a major trade route by the 1370s DR. \n\nAfter the water level of the [[Inner Sea]] dropped following the events of the [[Spellplague]], the Easting Reach receded southward significantly, and travelers along Merchant's Run were able to proceed passed Ilmwatch across the [[Easting River]] all the way to [[Uthmere]], where they could take the [[Great Road]] heading further east.",
