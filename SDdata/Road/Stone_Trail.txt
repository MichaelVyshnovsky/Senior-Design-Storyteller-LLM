The '''Stone Trail''' was a rough dirt road that ran eastâ€”west through a stretch of the [[Dessarin Valley]]. The [[dwarven]] landmark of [[Stone Bridge]] allowed for passageway along the road over the [[River Dessarin]].

==Geography==
The road connected the settlement of [[Westbridge]], fittingly enough on the west end of the road, to [[Beliard]], on the eastern side.
