The '''Cormyr Stairs''' was one of three major pedestrian stairs that connected the [[Tilverton/Lower City|Lower City]] and the [[Tilverton/Old Town|Old Town]] in the [[Cormyrean]] city of [[Tilverton]].

==Geography==
The Cormyr Stairs were the stairs in the western side of town, just by the city gate that led towards wider Cormyr and the [[Gnoll Pass]]. The stair climb was the only way into the wealthier and less crowded Old Town apart from passing the [[Upper City Gate]] on the southernmost side of Tilverton. Directly to the stair's south stood the ruined [[Tilver's Palace]]. Halfway up the Cormyr Stairs stood the landing with the [[Helm]]'s shrine â€“ the [[Altar of Shields]].
