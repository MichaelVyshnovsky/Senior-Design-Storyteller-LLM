The Cormyr Stairs was one of three major pedestrian stairs that connected the Lower City and the Old Town in the Cormyrean city of Tilverton.
The Cormyr Stairs were the stairs in the western side of town, just by the city gate that led towards wider Cormyr and the Gnoll Pass. The stair climb was the only way into the wealthier and less crowded Old Town apart from passing the Upper City Gate on the southernmost side of Tilverton. Directly to the stairs south stood the ruined Tilvers Palace. Halfway up the Cormyr Stairs stood the landing with the Helms shrine â€“ the Altar of Shields.
