        "Description": "The Street of the Sorceress split from the [[Moonsea Ride]] and the [[North Ride]] at the Tilverton Market, running south through the city and up the [[Market Stairs]] past the [[Rose Altar]]. In the Old Town it looped tightly around the inner side, passing [[Knights' Ride]] and [[Haddock Row]], fronting the [[Grimwald's Revenge]] inn, and then past [[Phorn's Lane]]. The route then exited the Old Town at the [[Tilver Stairs]] and the [[Green Altar]], intersecting with the end of [[Gateguard Road]] and finally looping around entirely back to the Moonsea Ride closer to the eastern city gate."
