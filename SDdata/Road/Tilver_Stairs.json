        "mainbody": "The '''Tilver Stairs''' was one of three major pedestrian stairs that connected the [[Tilverton/Lower City|Lower City]] and the [[Tilverton/Old Town|Old Town]] in the [[Cormyrean]] city of [[Tilverton]].",
        "Geography": "The Tilver Stairs were the southern stairs, while the [[Market Stairs]] was in the middle of the city, and the [[Cormyr Stairs]] stood on Tilverton's western side. The stair climbs were the only way into the richer, less crowded Old Town apart from passing the [[Upper City Gate]]. The Tilver Stairs were part of the [[Street of the Sorceress]] that twisted and turned across both parts of the city, and it was along the stairs that visitors and locals could reach the landing where stood the [[Green Altar]] and its circular garden dedicated to [[Silvanus]], the Oak Father."
