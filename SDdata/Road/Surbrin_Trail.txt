The Surbrin Trail was a long trail that passed through the farmlands around the fortified city of Yartar, in the Dessarin Valley region.
The trail went north from Yartar, around the western border of the Evermoors, and extended to Mornbryns Shield and further to the city of Nesmé.
The southern stretch of the Surbrin Trail was well-protected by Yartarran patrols.
