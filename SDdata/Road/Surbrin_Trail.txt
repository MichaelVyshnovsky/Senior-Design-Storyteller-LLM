The '''Surbrin Trail''' was a long trail that passed through the farmlands around the fortified city of [[Yartar]], in the [[Dessarin Valley]] region.

==Geography==
The trail went north from Yartar, around the western border of the [[Evermoors]], and extended to [[Mornbryn's Shield]] and further to the city of [[Nesmé]].

==Activities==
The southern stretch of the Surbrin Trail was well-protected by Yartarran patrols.
