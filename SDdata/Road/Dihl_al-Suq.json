        "Description": "Cargo transported using this route departed [[Huzuz]] following the natural currents flowing to the north, avoiding the deepest sections of [[Zakharan seas|Suq Bay]] where the currents slowed.",
        "History": "Suq Bay had few truly dangerous storms, but pirate activity was often a problem for vessels traveling by this route. To thwart the pirates, Golden Huzuz kept 20 heavily armed warships patrolling the bay at all times. They were tasked with hunting pirates and destroying any sea monsters they encountered."
