        "mainbody": "Wagonslide Alley was a small alley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.\nWagonslide Alley was located in the western section of Waterdeeps Sea Ward. The alley originated on Seawatch Street where it branched west then southwest to end on Westwall Street after a short distance.\nThe loose stones paving Wagonslide Alley caused many pedestrians to trip. Sea rime was quick to freeze here during the winter months, causing wagons to slip on the cobbles."
