'''Silverscales Street''' was a cobbled lakeside street in [[Suzail]]. It stretched from [[The Basin]], the city's commercial deepwater harbor, to the edge of [[Bolliver's Wharf]].{{cite web| url = http://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Dec 2004 | accessdate = 13-04-2021| date = 13-04-2021}}

==Description==
The street was a more or less straight line that began at the buildings constructed on Suzail's Basin, immediately crossed the southern end of [[Nerester's Run]], and continued southeast, past the end of the [[Court Close]], crossing the [[Dancing Druid Lane]], moving along Bolliver's Wharf's eastern shore and ending at the ninety degree turn into another lakeside street.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|68}}

The northern part of Silverscales Street was always decorated with many frames for drying fishing nets. The amount of drying nets was a telltale sigh of how abundant the day's catch was.

===Notable Locations===
*The [[Black Rat]], a small and dingy but pleasant and welcoming inn and eatery nestled on the southern side between Nerester's Run and [[Tholone Lane]].
*[[Shaliber's Ship]], a curious ship docked in Bolliver's Wharf that served as an inn.
*[[Starsails House]], the guildhall of Suzail's [[Seafarers Guild]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211125142704/https://candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_101112-05.htm| title = So Saith Ed Oct â€“ Dec 2005| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}
