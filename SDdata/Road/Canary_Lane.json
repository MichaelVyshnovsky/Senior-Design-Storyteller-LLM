        "History": "In the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, on [[Kythorn 19]], the Sailor's Crossing plaza became a scene of a grizzly murder. An adventuring detective named [[Tav]] conducted the investigation when a cloaked figure of a thief darted past, carrying a [[coin]] purse stolen from the murder victim. On [[Kythorn 22]], Tav ventured to Canary Lane in an attempt to track down the thief, who was considered a prime suspect. The investigator chased down a young urchin nicknamed [[Magpie (thief)|Magpie]] who ended up slipping past drain grates into the sewers, marked with the symbol of [[The Guild]]."
