        "mainbody": "he Dark Road was a forest route in the Dalelands leading from Ashabenford in Mistledale to Essembra in Battledale.\nThe road was named for the extensive shroud of trees shading its path. It was also associated with the ominous fate awaiting non-elves who ventured into the Vale of Lost Voices. Drow elves also had to be careful on this road.\nThe road started in the area around Ashabenford, cut through Cormanthor, and meandered to Essembra, passing the Vale of Lost Voices.\nThe Dark Road originally served as a simple pathway for elves from Cormanthor and the Tangled Vale to reach the heart of the Vale of Lost Voices, during the vales early years.\nIn the period after the Opening of Myth Drannor, the road gradually broadened as a natural result of regular usage.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, those on a journey were strongly advised to steer clear of this little-traveled path, as it led to the age-old burial sites of elves where travelers could accidentally stumble upon elven ghosts and banshees threatening to kill all non-elven intruders. The Dark Road ends were also protected by baelnorn guards dissuading everyone except funeral processions from accessing the sacred place."
