        "mainbody": "The '''Dark Road''' was a forest route in the [[Dalelands]] leading from [[Ashabenford]] in [[Mistledale]] to [[Essembra]] in [[Battledale]].",
        "Name": "The road was named for the extensive shroud of trees shading its path. It was also associated with the ominous fate awaiting non-[[elves]] who ventured into the [[Vale of Lost Voices]]. [[Drow]] elves also had to be careful on this road.",
        "Travel": "The road started in the area around Ashabenford, cut through [[Cormanthor]], and meandered to Essembra, passing the Vale of Lost Voices.",
        "History": "The Dark Road originally served as a simple pathway for elves from Cormanthor and the [[Tangled Vale]] to reach the heart of the Vale of Lost Voices, during the vale's early years.\n\nIn the period after the [[Myth Drannor#Glory of Myth Drannor|Opening]] of [[Myth Drannor]], the road gradually broadened as a natural result of regular usage.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], those on a journey were strongly advised to steer clear of this little-traveled path, as it led to the age-old burial sites of elves where travelers could accidentally stumble upon elven [[ghost]]s and [[banshee]]s threatening to kill all non-elven intruders. The Dark Road ends were also protected by [[baelnorn]] guards dissuading everyone except funeral processions from accessing the sacred place."
