The '''Long Reach''', also called the '''Centaur Trail''', was a trail that ran through [[the Vast]], connecting the village of [[Orlimmin]] and the town of [[King's Reach]].

From west to east, it began at Orlimmin, passed around the edge of the [[Highbank Forest]], ran through [[Bambryn]] and across the plains to [[Sendrin]], and ended at King's Reach at the foot of the [[Troll Mountains (the Vast)|Trollcrag Mountains]]. On the way, it linked with the [[Tantras Trail]], the [[Hlintar Ride]], [[Blaern's Trail]], and the [[North Road]].
