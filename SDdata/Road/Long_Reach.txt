The Long Reach, also called the Centaur Trail, was a trail that ran through the Vast, connecting the village of Orlimmin and the town of Kings Reach.
From west to east, it began at Orlimmin, passed around the edge of the Highbank Forest, ran through Bambryn and across the plains to Sendrin, and ended at Kings Reach at the foot of the Trollcrag Mountains. On the way, it linked with the Tantras Trail, the Hlintar Ride, Blaerns Trail, and the North Road.
