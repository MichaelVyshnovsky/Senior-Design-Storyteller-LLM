Fox Bottom was one of three major moots in Baldurs Gate, located on the border between Brampton and Eastway districts of the city.
Fox Bottom was located just two blocks south of the Manycoins House, on the portion of the street previously known as Hulkael Street, that became dramatically shortened by the 15 century DR.In Ed Greenwoods Candlkeep post, Hulkael Street would bend towards Fox Bottom, however, in later sources, that street became a portion of Stormshore Street. This article functions on the belief that by the late 15 century DR, Hulkael Street was cut short to just stretching between Lathdell and Murls Rest. Another street that crossed the moot was Long Lane.
Fox Bottom was in the area of Baldurs Gate that, by the late 14 century DR, was the closest thing the city had to a slum. The crossing was outlined by old rundown buildings and rat-infested rooming-houses. The windows and ropes across were decorated with drying washed laundry, and the sidewalks were filled with beggars and maimed old sailors. Due to the moot being in a busy part of Baldurs Gate, it was frequented by well-armed patrols.
The crossings name â€“ Fox Bottom, originated from what it was in the distant past. This part of the city was once a wooded hollow where many foxes raised their young in well-hidden dens.
