'''Fox Bottom''' was one of three major moots in [[Baldur's Gate]], located on the border between [[Brampton]] and [[Eastway]] districts of the city.

==Location==
Fox Bottom was located just two blocks south of the [[Manycoins House]], on the portion of the street previously known as [[Hulkael Street]], that became dramatically shortened by the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].In Ed Greenwood's Candlkeep post, Hulkael Street would bend towards Fox Bottom, however, in later sources, that street became a portion of Stormshore Street. This article functions on the belief that by the late 15{{th}} century DR, Hulkael Street was cut short to just stretching between [[Lathdell]] and [[Murl's Rest]]. Another street that crossed the moot was [[Long Lane]].

==Description==
Fox Bottom was in the area of Baldur's Gate that, by the late 14{{th}} century DR, was the closest thing the city had to a slum. The crossing was outlined by old rundown buildings and [[rat]]-infested rooming-houses. The windows and ropes across were decorated with drying washed laundry, and the sidewalks were filled with beggars and maimed old sailors. Due to the moot being in a busy part of Baldur's Gate, it was frequented by well-armed patrols.

==History==
The crossing's name – Fox Bottom, originated from what it was in the distant past. This part of the city was once a wooded hollow where many [[fox]]es raised their young in well-hidden dens.
