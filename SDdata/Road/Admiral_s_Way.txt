'''Admiral's Way''' was a dockside street in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Description==
Admiral's Way was located in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]], a single city block south of [[Sailor's Crossing]] plaza. The [[Low Lantern]] [[festhall]] was docked at the eastern end of Admiral's Way in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, on [[Kythorn 19]], the Sailor's Crossing plaza became a scene of a grizzly murder, located just within earshot of Admiral's Way. A puking [[human]] male was reported being on Admiral's Way shortly after the murder took place, but the detective missed the opportunity to interrogate the likely witness.
