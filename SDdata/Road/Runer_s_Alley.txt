Runers Alley was a small backalley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.
Runers Alley was located in the southeast section of Waterdeeps Sea Ward. It connected the southern ends of the Sutherlane and Haltovar Street, passing through a small neighborhood just north of Julthoon Street near the border with the Castle Ward.
The alley was named for a minstrel called Runer who slept here for many years.
