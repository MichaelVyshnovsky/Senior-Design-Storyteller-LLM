'''Suldroon Street''' was a prominent street in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|62}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 50: Khôltar, Part 1, First Impressions}}

==Description==
Suldroon was a major east&ndash;west thoroughfare that ran the full width of the city until it reached the inner walls and the unnamed lane that circumnavigated the town, servicing all the guard towers.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|76}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 59: Khôltar, Part 10, Hungry in Handrornlar, and More}} It was north of, and parallel to, [[Erethorn's Ride]], and intersected both [[Orntathtar Way]] and the [[North Way]]. Near the middle of its course, the [[Iron Way]] formed a T-intersection heading south to [[High Khôltar]].

The portion of Suldroon near the Iron Way was clustered with the opulently carved klathlaaedin (stone mansions) of the [[Onsruur]] (council of lords), but in smaller numbers than at the other end of the Iron Way where it intersected Erethorn's Ride. The area surrounding High Khôltar was known as "Deepcoin" to the locals. Farther out from the center, huge residential towers called "greatfists" were the dwellings of successful merchants and socialites.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 56: Khôltar, Part 7, Leaving the Farrgaunlar}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|79-80}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 61: Khôltar, Part 12, A Tour of Dubrinlar}}
