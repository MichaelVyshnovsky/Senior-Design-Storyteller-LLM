        "Description": "Gateguard Road went on a twisting, irregular course through the Old Town of Tilverton. The northern end came off of [[Knights' Ride]] near the [[Cormyr Stairs]], and went south around the grounds of [[Tilver's Palace]] past the [[Tower of Wits and Work]], [[Temple of Gond Wondermaker]], and the [[Windlord's Rest]] (later [[Jonstyl's Banner]]). It curved east along the southern edge of the city, passing by a side lane that held [[Undreir Facilitations]] and the newer location of the Windlord's Rest, before passing through the Upper City Gate and down a more gentle slope of the city's knoll that didn't require stairs. It finally terminated at an intersection with the [[Street of the Sorceress]] in southern Tilverton."
