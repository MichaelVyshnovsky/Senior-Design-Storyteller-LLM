'''Bindle Street''' was a slightly arched street that began on the edge of [[The Steeps]], ran across [[Heapside]], and ended in the [[Baldur's Gate/Eastway|Eastway]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Location==
Bindle Street began at the city's [[Old Wall (Baldur's Gate)|Old Wall]], where the famous store, [[Felogyr's Fireworks]], stood. From there, the street ran north, slightly curving away from the harbor, and then back towards the water. Along the way, it passed the [[Blushing Mermaid]], ran parallel to [[The Eastern Wet]], and ended just a block east of [[Athcaulyr's Stand]] docks.{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220221195407/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Nov â€“ Dec 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}} Most of [[Loklee Street]] ran parallel, to the east of Bindle Street.
