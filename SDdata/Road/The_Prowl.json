It ran in between Alnether Street and the western end of Cymbrils Walk, branching west off the southern end of Alnether Street to loop through a small neighborhood before connecting with Cymbrils Walk.\nThe alley was named for a nobleman who enjoyed loosing his pet panthers in the alley to terrorize the neighborhood. The Prowl was also truly haunted. A pair of skeletal hands lurked in the alley, strangling unsuspecting victims from behind four times per year."
