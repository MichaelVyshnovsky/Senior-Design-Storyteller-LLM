The Silver Road linked Silverymoon to Sundabar and was 165 miles long.
Starting at Silverymoon the road passed by Khelb before entering Silverymoon Pass. The road exited Silverymoon Pass at Auvandell, and continued on to terminate at Sundabar. The road was patrolled by the Knights in Silver, from Silverymoon, and by troops from Sundabar to stop monsters and bandits preying on the roads traffic.
