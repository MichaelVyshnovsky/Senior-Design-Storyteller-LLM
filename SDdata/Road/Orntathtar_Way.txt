'''Orntathtar Way''' was a main thoroughfare in the city of [[Khôltar]] in [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|67}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 53: Khôltar, Part 4, Our Tour Begins}}

==Description==
Orntathtar Way was a cobblestone street three times as wide as a typical street in Khôltar. It connected Dubrinlar (the west gate through the walls of Khôltar) with Handrornlar (the north gate) and was one leg of the triangle of roads connecting all three city gates. Orntathtar Way intersected with the [[North Way]] at Handrornlar, and with [[Hael Way]] at Dubrinlar.

Starting at Dubrinlar, on the north side of the gate (and Orntathtar Way) was [[Darrusktraal]], the imposing garthraun (police) station and duty-house for collecting the entry tax. Across the street, on the flat prow of the intersection with Hael Way, were the [[Malgart House]] and [[Manycoins Hall]], both of which faced west out the gate. An alley separated Darrusktraal from [[Halamor's Tower]], [[Hindror House]], and [[Nolvur's Manyworks]] (in that order, proceeding northeast along Orntathtar Way). Next was a textile district with cloth and clothing merchants and warehouses. Behind the businesses that fronted Orntathtar were neighborhoods of greatfists (large residential towers) belonging to the wealthier members of Khôltan society.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|79-80}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 61: Khôltar, Part 12, A Tour of Dubrinlar}}

Two major secondary roads ran east-west from wall to wall and both crossed Orntathtar Way. The southernmost was [[Erethorn's Ride]] and the northernmost was [[Suldroon Street]]. East of Orntathtar on either road, about half-way to the [[North Way]], was the district known locally as "Deepcoin", where many of the [[Onsruur]] (families with a seat on the council of lords) and the Belarkh (elected ruler of the Iron City) resided.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|82}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 62 Khôltar, Part 13, High Khôltar}}

Approaching Handrornlar, on the left (northwest) side of the street was the [[dwarven]]-favored  tavern known as [[Phlambror's]]{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|74-75}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 58: Khôltar, Part 9, Tarrying Nigh Handrornlar}} and the heart of the Stout Folk's social scene, [[Taurgaur's Tarjteir]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|73}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 57: Khôltar, Part 8, A First Look at Handrornlar}} Behind these two establishments was a lower-class neighborhood of fists (smaller residential towers) that contained the infamous [[Dark Corner]]&mdash;a meeting place where patrons paid for guaranteed privacy and no questions asked. Hard by the Tarjteir was the last building on this side of Orntathtar Way, Drurntraal (literally, "West Traal", or the west tower of [[Turthtraal]], the garthraun station and duty-house that bracketed Handrornlar with twin towers).

Across the street from the Tarjteir, on the blunted point of the intersection of Orntathtar and North Ways, was (west to east) [[Harmeirlarko's Journeys]], [[Surlpar's Stews]], and [[Jamrado's Thanetalium]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|77-78}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 60: Khôltar, Part 11, A Last Look Around Handrornlar}}

==History==
The final gates of Khôltar were constructed during the tenure of the dwarven Shieldlord [[Angloam Dubrin]] ([[577 DR|Year of the Alabaster Mounds, 577 DR]], to the [[619 DR|Year of Orcsfall, 619 DR]]) so Orntathtar Way was also completed during this period.

This thoroughfare was named after the human [[Embran Orntathtar]], the first (self-appointed) Belarkh of Khôltar. He was a garthraun official who declared martial law after Shieldlord Dubrin abdicated his position as governor of the city in 619 DR, and disappeared along with most of the dwarven guards, soldiers, and political appointees. Orntathtar violently put an end to the civil strife and street-fighting that erupted among the Onsruur trying to fill the power vacuum with claims of supreme leadership. The fundamental rules and laws that governed Khôltar were reviewed, modified, and reenacted under his rule.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|85-86}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 65: Khôltar, Part 16, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 3}}
