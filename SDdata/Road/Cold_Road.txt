The '''Cold Road''' was a route in the [[Unapproachable East]], heading roughly north from [[Nethentir]] in western [[Thay]]{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition/Map}} to [[Hoarbridge]] in northern [[Narfell]].{{cite book/The Forgotten Realms Atlas|7}}

==Geography==
From Nethentir in the [[tharch]] of [[Lapendrar]], the road travelled north beneath the western edge of the [[Thayan Plateau]] to [[Surcross]], from where it traversed the [[River Sur]] to enter [[Thesk]] and proceeded north to [[Two Stars]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|149}} Two Stars served as a major crossroads where the Cold Road heading north met the [[Golden Way]] heading east to [[Mulsantir]] and west to the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|144}}{{cite book/Unapproachable East|185}} The exact intersection between the Cold Road and the Golden Way meet in the courtyard of [[Gallidy Castle]], home of the city's ruling family.

From Two Stars, the Cold Road followed the western shore of [[Lake Ashane]] through the [[Ashanath]] region to meet the [[Great Road]] at [[Kront]], which connected through the [[Great Dale]] to [[Uthmere]] on the [[Easting Reach]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|115}}{{cite book/Unapproachable East|174}} The Cold Road proceeded north from Kront into [[Narfell]] through the [[Helena Gap]]{{cite book/The Bloodstone Lands/Map}} between the [[Rawlinswood]] (later called the Dunwood) and the [[Firward Mountains]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|118}} During the summer, the great [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]] Trade Fair of [[Bildoobaris]] was set up near this part of the road.{{cite book/The Bloodstone Lands|30-31}}

Continuing north to the trading town of [[N'Jast]] in Narfell, the Cold Road intersected with the [[Long Road (Northeast Faer√ªn)|Long Road]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|190}} It then continued north past N'Jast,{{cite book/The Bloodstone Lands|16}} Owing to plentiful game in this region, it was not unlikely to encounter [[yeti]] or hunters from one of the Nar tribes,{{cite book/The Bloodstone Lands|35}} particularly the [[Abordabe]] and [[Ragnor (tribe)|Ragnor]].{{cite book/The Bloodstone Lands|18-19}} The road then skirted the western edge of the [[Icerim Mountains]] to arrive in [[Snowcap]] before passing through [[Antlerbones]] and ending in [[Hoarbridge]] on the southern shores of the [[Icelace Lake]].

==Trade==
The Cold Road was the critical north-south trade route through the Unapproachable East. It allowed for trade between the lands of the south and the Nar tribes and [[dwarf]] villages of the Icerim Mountains to the north, and turned settlements along its route&mdash;like Kront and Two Stars&mdash;into important hubs.

While the stretch of the road between Two Stars and Kront was well-maintained, much of the Cold Road was little more than a wagon track.

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], some maps showed the Cold Road passing originating in the Thayan settlement of [[Tezir]] on the edge of the [[Surmarsh]] before heading north to Two Stars, as opposed to originating in the much further south Nethentir.

The road south of Two Stars into Thay was disrupted by the cataclysmic events of the [[Spellplague]], which tore the land apart and left the terrain broken and choked in volcanic smoke. This region became known as the [[Bonedark Hills]].

By {{yearlink|1479}}, the Cold Road was still in operation: [[N'Jast]]{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|134}} yet sat at the same crossroads.
