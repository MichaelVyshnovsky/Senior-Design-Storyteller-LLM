It cut the corner between the Street of Glances and both Gorl Street and Sighing Maidens Walk.\nAn entry into the Waterdeep sewers was found on Sniff Alley beside its lone tree.\nThe alley was named for a perpetual pile of rotting fishbones that was present until the Lords of Waterdeep enacted new laws about piling garbage."
