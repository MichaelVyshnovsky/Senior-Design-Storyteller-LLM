Pharras Alley was an alley in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep near the House of Wonder.
The alley ran west to east from Flint Street to Diamond Street. It was intersected from the north by Torch Lane and from the south by the Street of Spells.
The alley was named for Pharra, the first Magistress of the House of Wonder, who died in 1247 DR.
* Eltorchul Villa.
* House of Wonder
Wizards and clerics of the Circle of Skulls haunted the alleyway, an infrequent and unpredictable phenomenon that the alley was infamous for.
The alley was often used as a convenient shortcut by merchants passing through and as a favorite gathering place for young apprentice mages who hoped to impress the wizards of the nearby House of Wonder.
