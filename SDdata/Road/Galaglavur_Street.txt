'''Galaglavur Street''' was a street in [[Khôltar]], the Iron City, ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|79-80}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 61: Khôltar, Part 12, A Tour of Dubrinlar}}

==Description==
This cobblestone street began at [[Hael Way]] just a short walk east-southeast of Dubrinlar, the western gate through the walls of Khôltar. On the western corner was [[Vandanamer's]], a noisy and popular luthdren (restaurant). On the eastern corner was another loud establishment, [[Krostur's Forge]]. Opposite the mouth of Galaglavur Street, the view was mostly of the back side of [[Manycoins Hall]]. Galaglavur ran off in a southerly direction from Hael Way.
