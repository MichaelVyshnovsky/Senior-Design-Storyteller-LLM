Moanders Road was a wide straight line road running from Yulash to Myth Drannor that was created by the Abomination of Moander in 1357 DR.
The Moanders Road ran through the northern side of Cormanthors rimwood in a straight line almost all the way to Myth Drannor. The end of the road was marked by a hill of rot left behind by the god. For years after the rot bloomed with strange and alien blossoms that harbored unknown horrors inside.
Unlike other forest roads, the Moanders Road was created in less than one day in 1357 DR. The long thought dead god of rot and decay Moander kept a piece of himself, so-called Abomination of Moander, locked away in Yulash. The hero Alias unwittingly roused the avatar, and it made its way through the forest towards the city of the gods ancient enemies. Even though the creature was stopped, it absorbed all trees and plants and anything alive on its way through Cormanthor. Upon the abominations demise, it left behind a huge hill that rose above the treetops of the forest.
Eventually, the path excavated by the Abomination started to regain plant life of grass and shrubbery. Zhentarim agents were quick to utilize the road for their own purposes.
