About halfway along the road, a great blizzard fell upon the mountains, and Samon was forced to seek shelter. He found a simple peasants hut and was welcomed within.

Rejecting his vows of chastity, he romanced the girl and slept with her three nights in a row, which, by local customs, meant that she was now his wife.
