Blackhorn Alley was a hard-packed dirt and gravel alleyway in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.
This road ran east off of the Way of the Dragon, ending in a deadend in the block of buildings that stood between Way of the Dragon and the High Road. In the center of the alleyway, it was the northern terminus of Burdag Lane.
Blackhorn Alley was named for a cobbler that once lived on it, Alsible Blackhorn. Long after his death, by 1360s DR, it became a frequent haunt of brown giant rats. Some of the more destitute Waterdhavians were known to go after these rats with clubs or the alleys empty crates, viewing them as an easy meal.
