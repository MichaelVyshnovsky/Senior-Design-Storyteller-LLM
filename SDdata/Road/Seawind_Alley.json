        "mainbody": "Seawind Alley was an alley in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep notable for the ghostly voices that could be heard within the alley.\nThe alley ran from the south side of the Street of Lances into the city block between Westwall Street and the Street of the Singing Dolphin.\nAround 1267 DR, the alley led to an inn known as the Banshee at Bay. One night everyone in the establishment was found dead from an unknown disease and many inhabitants of Waterdeep stated the restless spirits of those killed haunt the alleyway.\n* Gerins Breads\n*Banshee at Bay\nThe voices were harmless and usually spoke nothing but nonsensical phrases. The only resident of note was the Avolakia Briarbones who lived in the sewers under the alley so he could study the phenomenon of the voices."
