}}'''Harrow Ride''' was the name given to two separate roads leading through [[Harrowdale]], in the [[Dalelands]], one on either side of the dried river bed.

At the south east end of the route lay [[New Velar]], and the north west part of the route went through [[Velarsburg]] before becoming the [[Halfaxe Trail]] at [[Velartree]].
