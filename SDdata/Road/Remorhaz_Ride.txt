The '''Remorhaz Ride''' was an icy path that crossed the tundra west of the [[Great Glacier]], connecting [[Frozen Flindyke]] with [[Mount Ghaethlauntar]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}} The course of the road passed through the eastern edge of the [[Frozen Forest]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|63}}

==Geography==
The bridge in Flindyke linked the Remorhaz Ride with the [[Way of the Powrie]] trail, which continued southwards into the lands of the [[Moonsea]].

==Inhabitants==
The territory surrounding the road had long been claimed by [[gnoll]]s, but as of the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, marauding [[remorhaz]] freely roamed the region, after they had been chased down from the Great Glacier by more dire threats. Despite the danger, gnolls continued to use the road to move [[sledge]] caravans full of ore from Mount Ghaethluntar to Frozen Flindyke.
