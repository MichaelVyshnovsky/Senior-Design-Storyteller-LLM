        "mainbody": "he Long Road was a route in northeast Faerûn that connected the Kingdom of Damara to the far north of Rashemen.\nThe road provided a trade route between the Cold Lands and the Unapproachable East, connecting the merchants of Damara, Rashemen, and Narfell. as the road was little more than a wide trail, and parts were impassable during the winter.\nWhile some maps put the route’s western origin in Damara at Helgabal, the Long Road itself truly began along the Merchants Run just south of the city of Trailsend in the Barony of Polten. From there, it travelled northeast along the edge of the Dunwood, passing through the town of Tellerth before heading north through the Giantspire Mountains at Giant Gap to arrive in Narfell. The Gap was less a pass and more an area of low hills between the mountains, and was known to become clogged with snow in the winter months.\nIn Narfell, the route passed the Nar meeting grounds at Nar-sek Quistrade before proceeding east to its first major stopover at the village of Jiyyd, at Mistbridge and crossing the Iceborn River, before finally ending in Nathoud at the base of the Icerim Mountains.\n* Trailsend, a city on the western end of the route, although the road truly began further south of the city along Merchants Run.\n* Tellerth, a farming and logging town in Damara.\n* Giantspire Gap, the pass through the Giantspire Mountains.\n* Nar-sek Quistrade, a neutral meeting place of the Nar tribes.\n* Jiyyd, a crossroads village in Narfell connecting the route to Peltarch.\n* Ormpur, a trademeet in Narfell.\n* NJast, a crossroads village in Narfell where the Long Road crossed the Cold Road.\n* Mistbridge, where the road crossed the River Erech.\n* Fortress of the Half-Demon, an ancient Nar castle.\n* Nathoud, a fortified town on the eastern end of the route. Here the Long Road met the Huhrongs Road."
