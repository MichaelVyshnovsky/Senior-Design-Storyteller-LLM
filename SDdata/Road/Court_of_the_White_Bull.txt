The '''Court of the White Bull''' was a prominent, hardpacked dirt courtyard in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of the city of [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
The courtyard as a whole was a [[wild magic|wild magic zone]], causing [[magic]] cast there to some or often times go awry. Though it being a wild magic zone was only known to the wider public as rumors.

==Geography==
This courtyard was located to the north of [[River Street]] and the [[River Gate]].

From the north, the Court of the White Bull was the southern terminus of [[Gaustus Street]], [[Nethpranter's Street]], and the [[Wide Way]]. Its western side was the eastern terminus of [[Chelor's Alley]]. And its southern side was the northern terminus of [[Salabar Street]], [[Urcandle Alley]], and [[Walltower Walk]].

==Activities==
The Court of the White Bull acted as a bazaar, being regularly visited by caravan owners to meet up and peddle their wares fresh from their wagons. Livestock was also commonly bought and sold here.

Beyond commerce, in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] this courtyard was commonly the site used to carry out floggings upon criminals.<ref>
===Law===
All manner of [[magic item]]s,

==History==
The Court of the White Bull earned its moniker from the miraculous birth of an [[albinism|albino]] [[bull]] on the spot to an astonished caravan owner. This incident occurred back when the spot laid outside of Waterdeep's [[Trollwall]], a time when the area was but an open field used by livestock and assembling caravans.

Taking the albino bull's birth as a good omen, the caravan owner went on to build a tavern at the spot that went by the name [[White Bull]]. The tavern later exploded in the midst of an infamous battle between [[Thongalar|Thongalar the Mighty]], [[Shile Rauretilar]], and Shile's apprentices.

The conflict between the [[mage]]s went on to not only cost Shile and his apprentices their lives, but tore at the [[Weave]] and ripped open a planar breach in the very fabric of the [[Prime Material plane]] to the [[Astral Plane]], a breach that was rapidly widening. This planar disaster was ultimately resolved by the [[deity]] [[Azuth]], who appeared in his [[avatar]] form and mended the breach, with later retellings of the event claiming he stitched reality and the Weave back together. Though as a consequence of the incident, the area became a wild magic zone.

One day in the late 14{{th}} century DR, a statue made of imported [[marble]] was unlawfully erected in the courtyard. The statue depicted a lone man, standing in a laborer's garb with a [[hammer]] in one hand and the other hand outstretched, its first finger extended out and curled into a hook&mdash;a vulgar gesture known locally as "hooking". Before the Lords of Waterdeep came to a decision on what to do about the statue, the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] were ordered to examine it, as the Lords were worried that it may have been a [[mimic]] as the courtyard [[Virgin's Square]] had faced a similar incident.{{Cite web/Waterdeep News/Lords Order Statue's Removal}}

Examining the statue, the Watch discovered that it sported several hidden cavities for dropping messages into, one of which actually held a scrip&mdash;its contents were never divulged to the public. After the thorough examination, the statue was pulled down and destroyed, and thereafter a proclamation about the incident was read before [[Piergeiron's Palace]].

==Reputation==
The Court of the White Bull was considered to be one of the landmarks of the Trades Ward.<ref>
