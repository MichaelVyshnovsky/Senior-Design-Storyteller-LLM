Belzers Walk was an alleyway in Waterdeep that stood on the boundary line of the citys Southern Ward and Trades Ward.The City of Waterdeep Trail Map and page 105 of the sourcebook Volos Guide to Waterdeep both misspell this road as "Belzors Walk". Some referred to the road as simply Belzers, much to the chagrin of Southern Ward locals, who were quick to correct those who called it such.
Paved in dirt and gravel, this alley stretched northeast out of Caravan Court and terminated on Wall Street.
