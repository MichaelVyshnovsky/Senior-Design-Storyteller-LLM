==Description==
Nerester's Run was connected to the [[Tholone Lane]] at its northern and by a smaller wagoncut through a cluster of building into the arching lane, located on Nerester's Run's southern end.

Most buildings on Nerester's Run's eastern side were stout three-story structures of stone and wood, all in need of repair and maintenance by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Many of the buildings operated businesses out of their ground floors and cellars. The top two floors of the buildings were used as apartments â€“ on a smaller side. Many of these ramshackle apartments were rented out by "retired old salts," small-scale smugglers, spies, dockworkers, and messengers. All the buildings on Nerester's Run were owned by middle-class merchants and merchant families of Suzail. The merchants rarely visited these properties and instead sent around rent-collectors every month, always accompanied by bodyguards.
