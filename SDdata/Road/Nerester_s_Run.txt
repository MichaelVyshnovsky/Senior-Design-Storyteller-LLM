Neresters Run was a short street in Suzail that began on Silverscales Streets western end and ran northeast in a straight line and abruptly ending at the end of the same block.
Neresters Run was connected to the Tholone Lane at its northern and by a smaller wagoncut through a cluster of building into the arching lane, located on Neresters Runs southern end.
Most buildings on Neresters Runs eastern side were stout three-story structures of stone and wood, all in need of repair and maintenance by the 14 century DR. Many of the buildings operated businesses out of their ground floors and cellars. The top two floors of the buildings were used as apartments â€“ on a smaller side. Many of these ramshackle apartments were rented out by "retired old salts," small-scale smugglers, spies, dockworkers, and messengers. All the buildings on Neresters Run were owned by middle-class merchants and merchant families of Suzail. The merchants rarely visited these properties and instead sent around rent-collectors every month, always accompanied by bodyguards.
