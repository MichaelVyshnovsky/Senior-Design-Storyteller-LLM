        "mainbody": "Dead Mans Walk was a trail that traversed the breadth of southern Vaasa, and was thus was a key piece of the northern trade route that ran from Damara to the Moonsea.\nThe road was filled with potholes. Travelers had to be cautious of dangerous fauna, notably packs of boars and wolves as well as giant wasps and giant leeches.\nDuring the boggy summer months, the trail became muddy and treacherous. In addition, travelers were beset by putrid smells and the constant buzzing and biting of insects. \nOn its western end, the trail originated at Avang on the Vaasan side of Garumns Climb, the pass that connected to the lands of the Moonsea North. Dead Mans Walk meandered north in the shadow of the Galena Mountains and entered the Bottomless Bogs. Here the route was laid with wooden logs intended to provide stability for travelers and wagons in the summer months when the entire region turned to mud.\nUpon reaching the Beaumaris River near Moortown,While the location of \"Deadman Pass\" is not specified in the short story Darksword, it is implied to be on the eastern side of the Bottomless Bogs. The story describes Melegaunt Tanthul having entered the Bottomless Bogs via Deadman Pass on his way to the Anauroch. In the late 15 century DR, the road then passed through the cliffside community of Kond before it climbed the southern face of the canyon out of the Clefts, and then continued eastward, skirting the northern edge of the Bleak Steppes of Haatar-Baen, until reaching Maur-Eturo. A short spur roughly midway along this segment led north to the capital, Telos City, via a bridge spanning the Clefts of Razack.\nFrom the crossroads at Maur-Eturo, the trail connected to a path leading to Darmshall across open plains to the east, and to Grambles Climb and Hulburg beyond to the south. Dead Mans Walk itself continued northerly to once again meet up with the Beaumaris at Nigels Ford before following the river east. In the mid&ndash14 century DR, it travelled along the rivers southern bank, while in the late 15 century DR, it crossed Nigels Ford to travel along the northern bank, where it passed through the tent city of Fugue. Either way, it then arrived in Bloodstone Pass via the Vaasan Gate.\nIn the mid-to-late 13 century DR, travelers along Dead Mans Walk had to be wary of attacks by bog people and dragonkin, who took advantage of the dense summer fogs to lay ambushes.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, travelers had to be cautions of orcs&mdashincluding from the Ring-nose clan&mdashand wights&mdashthe undead remains of soldiers who had served Zhengyi the Witch-King in the Bloodstone Wars.\n* The Vaasan Gate, a fortress at the entrance to Bloodstone Pass, and the eastern anchor of the trail.\n* Fugue, a tent city and refugee camp along the Beaumaris River in the late 15 century DR.\n* Nigels Ford, a crossing of the Beaumaris that was included in the route as of the late 15 century DR.\n* Maur-Eturo, a ranching town and crossroad in the Sunderland.\n* Kond, a trade outpost above the Beaumaris River in the late 15 century DR.\n* Moortown, an oft-ruined town in the Bottomless Bogs just off the trail.\n* Avang, a small settlement at the base of Garumns Climb, and the western anchor of the route."
