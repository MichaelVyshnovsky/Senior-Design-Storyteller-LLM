The '''Pilgrims' Route''' was a trade route located in [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Description==
[[Image:PilgrimRoute.png|thumb|right|''A map of Huzuz showing the Pilgrims' Route lined in black.'']]
Travelers departing [[Huzuz]] along the Pilgrims' Route exited the golden city through the [[Pilgrims' Gate]] before heading south. After passing the [[Shrine of the Brave]], travelers followed the southern curvature of [[Al-Akara Mountains]] toward [[Zayir]] in the east. Another {{SI|150|mi|k}} brought them to the [[Mosque of the Thirsty Jann]], at which point travelers moved south for {{SI|200|mi|k}} toward [[Hilm]] situated on [[Al-Muti River]] and the other [[Cities of the Pantheon]].

==History==
The name of this route was derived from the bountiful supply of [[pilgrim]]s traveling from the Cities of the Pantheon toward Huzuz.

Since it was used more by pilgrims than caravans, the chance of encountering bandits or raiders along this route was significantly less compared to other trade routes found throughout the Land of Fate.
