Travelers departing Huzuz along the Pilgrims Route exited the golden city through the Pilgrims Gate before heading south. After passing the Shrine of the Brave, travelers followed the southern curvature of Al-Akara Mountains toward Zayir in the east. Another  brought them to the Mosque of the Thirsty Jann, at which point travelers moved south for  toward Hilm situated on Al-Muti River and the other Cities of the Pantheon.
The name of this route was derived from the bountiful supply of pilgrims traveling from the Cities of the Pantheon toward Huzuz.
Since it was used more by pilgrims than caravans, the chance of encountering bandits or raiders along this route was significantly less compared to other trade routes found throughout the Land of Fate.
