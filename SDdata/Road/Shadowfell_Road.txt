The '''Shadowfell Road''' was a disorienting route that connected the city of [[Evernight]] to the nation of [[Thay]] through the [[Shadowfell]]. It was discovered and used in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] by agents of Thay loyal to [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] and [[Szass Tam]] to further their clandestine schemes in the [[Sword Coast North]].

==Description==
Travel along the Shadowfell Road was grueling and filled with horrors, but thanks to the space-warping properties of the Shadowfell, it was a quick but complex route across [[Faerûn]]. The [[magic]] of the route was such that the "road" only really existed if approached and followed precisely, making it easy to get lost without following a Thayan caravan. The route's true secrets were known only to a few.

Some stretches of the road were treacherous, following mountain ledges, crossing rickety wooden bridges, or passing through haunted terrain. Certain parts were particularly difficult to navigate with [[cart]]s, if not impossible.

==Geography==
Unlike a mundane trail, the Shadowfell Road comprised many disconnected paths&mdash;sperated by many miles if not across [[plane]]s&mdash;that were linked by subtle [[teleport|teleportation]] effects that had to be activated by following the route precisely. Efforts to take shortcuts or to join the path midway, or any failure to take the correct turn or to go through a specific archway or cave would mean backtracking to fix the mistake.

The route began in the Shadowfell city of Evernight. It exited the city via the southwestern gate before turning east through the [[Burning Woods]], The route then proceeded into the darker and more confusing depths of the Shadowfell for a few hours before arriving at its first teleportation point, which led to the haunted labyrinth known as [[Endless Alleys]]. The Alleys were not navigable by cart, and so the Thayans were known to leave carts at both this entrance and the exit further along the route (sometimes defended by their [[undead]] minions).

As the Shadowfell Road continued, it jumped back-and-forth between different places both within the Shadowfell and across the Material Plane. It ran through a wide array of regions and landscapes, including graveyards, mountains, ruins, swamps, and villages (some abandoned and others populated). One stretch bounced through secluded passes, vales, and ledges in the mountain ranges of [[Interior Faerûn|central Faerûn]] before [[shadow crossing|reentering the Shadowfell]] in a cave. Some of the locations through which the Road passed on [[Toril]] were not physically located between its starting point near [[Neverwinter]] and its endpoint in Thay. 

The Road eventually terminated in the town of [[Veil (town)|Veil]] in western Thay, a village split by a [[Shadow Veil|permanent rift]] between the planes that left half of it inside the Shadowfell.

==History==
The Thayans gained control over the Shadowfell Road sometime shortly before {{Yearlink|1479}}. This entailed not only discovering the very precise series of twists and turns required to traverse the whole route,

As a military supply route, the Shadowfell Road became a major point of tension between Thay and [[Netheril#Returned_Netheril|Netheril]], However, they were unable to do so decisively as of 1479 DR because the [[Shadow Veil]] in Veil disrupted their fortress's [[meteor tube]]s, which worked by routing projectiles through the Shadowfell to generate momentum.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Evernight]], the western terminus of the Road.
* [[Endless Alleys]], a haunted labyrinth of alleyways and rooftops.
* [[Still Waters (Shadowfell)|Still Waters]], an inhabited but intensely haunted swamp.
* The [[Obsidian Ziggurat]], a looming pyramid amid an abandoned village.
* [[Village of the Mad Druid]], a town where all of the people pretended to be undead.
* [[Veil (town)|Veil]], the eastern terminus of the Road, from which it was a short journey to Surcross.

==Inhabitants==
Unless accompanying a Thayan caravan or otherwise travelling in large numbers, monsters and factions along the Shadowfell Road were liable to attack any travelers. The Thayans themselves were a threat, as were their Netherese rivals for control of the Road. In addition, [[dark one]]s, [[Nightmare (creature)|nightmare]]s, [[shadow]]s, and undead monsters were potential threats, as were bandits and gangs of lost wanderers. Meanwhile, travelers approaching Veil had to contend with the Thayan garrison who defended the Shadow Veil, which included both living and undead soldiers in fortified bunkers equipped with [[arcane]] [[siege engine]]s.

Some of the villages through which the Road passed were populated with [[shadowborn]] inhabitants who simply wished for travelers to leave them alone, while other sites were abandoned and haunted by [[incorporeal]] [[spirit]]s.
