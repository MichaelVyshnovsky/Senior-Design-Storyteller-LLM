The '''Hunt Trail''' ran through [[the Vast]], connecting the towns of [[Ylraphon]] and [[Kurth (town)|Kurth]].

From west to east, it began at Ylraphon, passed the [[Flooded Forest]], ran through the village of [[Tavilar]] and the hills of [[Beluar's Hunt]] and ended at Kurth. On the way, it joined the [[Pass Trail]] and the [[North Road]].

The minstrel [[Lieshann]], traveling from Tavilar to Kurth, once took a wrong turn onto the trail to the [[Mage's Tower]], having mistaken it for the Hunt Trail.
