Taelas Trail was a small roadway found in eastern Sembia that connected Ordulin in the north with the smaller town of Surd in the southeast.
Taelas Trail meandered southeast from Ordulin before reaching Surd near the coast of the Sea of Fallen Stars.
Taelas Trails builder was Rorl Ossmran, a merchant out of Ordulin who lived long before the 14 century DR. The roadway bore the name of Rorls beloved, Taela.
