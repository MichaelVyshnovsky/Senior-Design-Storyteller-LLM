        "mainbody": "The '''Ten Trail''' was a trail that connected the [[Ten Towns]] to the southern edge of the [[Frozenfar]] and the rest of [[Faer√ªn]].",
        "Geography": "The trail began in the city of [[Fireshear]] and headed north through a pass along the [[Spine of the World]] as far as [[Bryn Shander]]. Travel through the Ten Trail was risky not only because of the low temperatures, since travelers along the road were also threatened by brigands, [[crag cat]]s, [[orc]]s, [[yeti]]s and even [[white dragon]]s.\n\nOn its northern leg past the mountains, the trail was known as the '''Caravan Trail''' and led up to the South Gate of Bryn Shander.\n\nThe mountain portion of the trail was almost impassable during the winter.\n\nSouth of the Spine of the World, the [[Iron Trail]] connected the Ten Trail to the city of [[Ironmaster]], but that trail practically disappeared during the winter. Further along its southern leg, the trail also connected to the [[Northern Means]], which headed towards [[Luskan]].",
        "Trade": "The Ten Trail was used by caravans to move goods to and from the cities in [[Icewind Dale]]. Because of its various dangers, caravans needed to be well armed for the trip."
