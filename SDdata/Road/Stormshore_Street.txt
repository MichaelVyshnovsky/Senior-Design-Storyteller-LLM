In the Candlekeep forums compilation of Ed Greenwoods lore, Stormshore Street is sad to run across the city, beginning by Stormkeep. However, published maps do not have a continuous street that stretches across the city while passing through location #11 indicated in Volos Guide to the Sword Coast. The same book also states that Stormshore Street passes Sorcerous Sundries, and, in Murder in Baldurs Gate and Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus, it is stated that Low Lantern is located on Stormshore Street and a city dock that bore the same name as Stormshore Street. According to the published sources, Stormshore Street had a dramatically curved shape.
