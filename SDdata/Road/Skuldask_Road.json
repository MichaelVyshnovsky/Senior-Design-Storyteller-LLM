        "mainbody": "'''Skuldask Road''' was a moderately traveled trade road in the [[Western Heartlands]] of [[Faer√ªn]]. It branched off of [[Thundar's Ride]] near the center of the [[Fields of the Dead]] and stretched east-southeast to [[Elturel]]. Below Elturel it crossed the [[River Chionthar]] and continued southeast until it met the [[Uldoon Trail]] just below [[Berdusk]].",

Click to enlarge.'']]\nAs of the [[1367 DR|Year of the Shield, 1367 DR]], there was a little-known village of [[gnomes]] and [[dwarves]] among the ruins at the intersection of Skuldask Road and Thundar's Ride called [[Tempus's Tears]]. Travel along the road was relatively safe because patrols of [[Hellriders]] from Elturel traveled this road every four hours or so, even at night. South of Elturel, the patrols ended at [[Windstream Lodge]] (one of their outposts).\n\nAs of the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the \"leaf farm\" owned by [[Tatha Beruel]], called [[Aloum Lyndren]], was located just north of Skuldask Road a few miles west of Elturel.{{Cite dragon/301/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Tatha's Broomworks|74}}"
