The '''Emerald Corridor''' was the main trade route in [[Chondath]] that stretched along the [[Vilhon Reach]] from the city of [[Arrabar]] to [[Hlath]], and further to [[Reth]].

==History==
The Emerald Corridor was established before the {{YearlinkName|139}} by Arrabar. Originally a busy pathway, it quickly became a major trade route. In 139 DR, the city of [[Shamph]] was erected along the corridor to be used as a storage and transporting stop for the busy Chondathan lumbering operations in the [[Chondalwood]].

The {{YearlinkName|900}} was marked by the raging [[Rotting Wars]]â€”a bloody civil war in Chondath. The first skirmish that sparked the conflict took place on the Emerald Corridor, south of the [[River Nun]], between the allied armies of [[Reth]] and [[Hlath]] against the forces of [[Neveris Bikou]], the ruler of Chondath.

The Emerald Corridor continued being a tumultuous trade route in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] as the cities of Hlath and [[Iljak]] engaged in a series of small-scale armed conflicts and raids against each other. This trade interruption only played into the hands of Arrabar and Shamph by sending merchants to their safer markets.
