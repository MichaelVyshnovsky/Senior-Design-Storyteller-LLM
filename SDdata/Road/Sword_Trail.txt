The Sword Trail was a traveling route that spanned a stretch of the northern coast of the Moonsea lake in north FaerÃ»n.
Unlike the adjacent Phlan Path, this road was like many trails in the region in that it was fairly under-developed as of the late 14 century DR.
The trail originated in the city-state of Melvaunt and followed the coast southeast, passing over the River Thent until it reached the independent city of Thentia.
