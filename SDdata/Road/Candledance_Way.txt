'''Candledance Way''' was the road that connected the [[Polyandrium]] and [[Myth Drannor]]'s City Heights area, allowing a more or less direct route to the [[Castle Cormanthor]].

==Geography==
Candledance Way traveled the distance between the city and the Polyandrium, over two springs that passed around the graveyard. The road crossed the bridge over the joining of the two springs, continuing south towards the City Heights. Reaching the city, the road became a street and veered west with a southwest curve. Further into the city, Candledance Way intersected with the [[Street of the Evening Star]]. The Street of the Evening Star itself went further, reaching the Castle Cormanthor, wrapping around it, and ending all the way to the north, at the [[Shaundakul's Throne]].

==History==
In [[1369 DR]], during the [[Cult of the Dragon]] occupation of the ruins of Myth Drannor, the Candledance Way was the main route for the cultists traveling between Castle Cormanthor and their excavation operation in the Polyandrium. Every {{SI|100|ft|long=yes}}, the Cult had groups of six guards armed with [[longbow]]s stationed on the Candledance Way, and the Street of the Evening Star. The route was patrolled during the day, and left empty at night, when vicious monsters roamed the ruins.
