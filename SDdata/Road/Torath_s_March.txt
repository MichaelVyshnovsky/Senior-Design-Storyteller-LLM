'''Torath's March''' was a trail that ran inland from the city of [[Phlan]] into the lands north of the [[Moonsea]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|56}}

==Geography==
The trail started at a point not far from the city, where the [[Phlan Path]] to [[Melvaunt]] turned east after running alongside the [[Quivering Forest]] to avoid the [[Twilight Marsh]]. It skirted along the northeastern edges of the forest and turned northwards when it reached the eastern edge of the [[Dragonspine Mountains]], continuing on until it reached [[Castle Vathar]].

At Castle Vathar, Torath's March connected with the [[Ilinvur Trail]] that continued north to [[Ilinvur]], and the [[Verdigris Trail]] that ran southwards to the community of [[Verdigris]].
