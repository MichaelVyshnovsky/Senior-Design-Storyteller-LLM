The '''Darkwalk''' was a dangerous road in [[Luskan]]'s [[Luskan/South Bank|South Bank]].

==Description==
The road took its name from the haunted reputation of the [[Ruins of Illusk]], through which it passed. Furthermore, many of Luskan's more notably dangerous alleyways branched off from the Darkwalk.

==Geography==
The road turned west from [[Aldever's Street]] at [[Captains' Close]] park and ran through the Ruins of Illusk to end at the [[Dark Arch]] bridge to [[Closeguard Island]] (and beyond that, to [[Cutlass Island]]). 

==History==
As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Darkwalk served as the boundary between the overgrown and [[undead]] haunted parts of the [[Illusk]] ruins on its north side and the safe and cleared part of the ruins to its south that had come to serve as burial grounds for rich Luskanites.
