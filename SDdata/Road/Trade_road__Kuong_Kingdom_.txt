The '''trade road''' was a road in the [[Kuong Kingdom]] in [[Malatra]].<ref group="note">Like many locations in the Kuong Kingdom, the Srelanat Road has not been labelled on any map of Malatra.

It began at the town of [[Javuhansa]], at the headwaters of the [[Kunong River]]. From there, it ran south, passing through the waystop village of [[Enlasre]]. Finally, it crossed the foothills of the [[Himasla Mountains]] and ended at [[Garuji]], the southernmost town of the kingdom.

As the name told, it saw much trade, with caravans bringing [[gold]] and [[ivory]] up from the southern jungles.

Kuong soldiers patrolled the trade route at points along its route. Those of Garuji guarded it through the Himasla foothills. Those of Yanajalan busied themselves with patrolling the trade road to make it safe for those who used it, but ''circa'' [[1357 DR]] they extorted "road fees" from travelers to guarantee their safe passage. Those from outside the kingdom who refused to pay risked being imprisoned for up to ten days and their property being confiscated.
