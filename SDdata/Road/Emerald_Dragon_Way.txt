'''Emerald Dragon Way''' was a prominent road found within the city of [[Suldolphor]] in far eastern [[Calimshan]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Suldolphor}}

==Location==
Emerald Dragon Way ran directly through the heart of central Suldolphor, stretching between [[Ludluth Street]] and [[Gaerul's Street]].

==Description==
The road curved gently from side to side along its route. Emerald Dragon Way glittered with ''[[faerie fire]]'' which decorated the lavish homes found along its length.

==Notable Locations==
All of Suldolphor's wealthiest families, including the [[Uluevryn]]s, [[Ilusproster]]s, [[Saccraran]]s, and many more, had estates lining both sides of Emerald Dragon Way.

==History==
The road was the site of a great battle between a forgotten hero and an [[emerald dragon]]. The hero prevailed and the bones of the great dragon were set into large transparent slabs found along both sides of the street.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some locals believed that anyone standing in front of the correct bone of the emerald dragon and asking a question with intense focus would hear the whispers of the slain beast giving answers or advice.
