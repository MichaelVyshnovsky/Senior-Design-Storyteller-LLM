Stonebolt Trail was a long trail found in the Stonelands of Cormyr that connected Gnoll Pass in the south with the Shadow Gap in the north.
The trail originated in Gnoll Pass in the Storm Horns, travelling nearly in a straight line northeast to reach the Shadow Gap in the Thunder Peaks north of Tilverton.
