        "mainbody": "The Rainbow Trail was located in Ra-Khati.\nThe trail was found at the junction of the Gogrus and Akundi rivers where they met at the Rainbow Falls. It passed by a series of buildings making up the Rainbow Monastery along a treacherous decent of over a thousand feet at the bottom of the waterfall.\nThe trail was used heavily by travelers and pilgrims passing through Ra-Khati. Monks from the monastery aided them in transporting their goods up and down the trail in return for a donation."
