This street ran east-southeast from the southern tip of the [[Westmarket]] area until it ended at [[Barrel Lane]] near the southern gate out of the city, known as the Sea Arch. Among the residences and shops on Saurovin Street was [[Shadowdark House]], an oddity that could roughly be called a magic shop.{{Cite dragon/287/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Shadowdark House|70}}"
