'''Hulkael Street''' was a short street in the [[Baldur's Gate/Heapside|Heapside]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]], near the city's eastern walls.

==Location==
Hulkael Street was a much larger street that cut across Heapside, [[Eastway]], and [[Brampton]] towards the [[Fox Bottom]] moot; however, the street became dramatically shortened by the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].In Ed Greenwood's Candlkeep post, Hulkael Street bends towards Fox Bottom, however, in later sources, that street became a portion of Stormshore Street. This article functions on the belief that by the late 15{{th}} century DR, Hulkael Street was cut short to just stretching between Lathdell and Murl's Rest. Hulkael Street began at the strake called [[Lathdell]], near the [[Shrine of the Suffering]], and moved to the [[Murl's Rest]] strake where [[Sorcerous Sundries]] stood.
