        "mainbody": "The Great Road, also referred to by locals as simply the Road, was the single roadway that passed through the length of the Great Dale and that for many years separated the Dunwood and the Forest of Lethyr, in the Unapproachable East region of northeast Faerûn.\nIt originated in the coastal city of Uthmere, along the Easting Reach, and continued east through the entirety of the dale until intersecting with the Cold Road at the hamlet of Kront.\nTraveling the length of the Great Road on foot took approximately 15 to 20 days. The Dalestream ran parallel with the road for nearly half of this distance. \nConstruction of the Great Road itself was initiated by Lord Uthmere, the first ruler of his namesake city.\nThe Great Road fell into disuse throughout the 15 century and was mostly overgrown as of the late 1470s DR.\nLong before humans \"settled\" the region of the Great Dale, a stretch of what would become the Great Road was the primary means of transportation between the elves of eastern Faerûn and Kara-Tur. This was achieved by means of a series of magical stones that could open a passageway to the eastern continent twice a year, on the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.\nDuring the Age of Humanity and the Era of Upheaval, this secret was well-protected by the druids of the Circle of Leth.\nSituated along the Great Road were about a dozen minor clanholds, including Carwyth Hold, Noonyms Hold, and Thys Hold.\n* Evreltheds Hill, a small farmstead situated about a half-days walk north of the road.\n* Great Barrow, a massive burial mound that was rumored to predate the ancient empire of Narfell.\n* Kront, the small crossroads town that hosted visiting traders from neighboring lands, including Thesk, Rashemen, and Narfell.\n* Mavalgard, a minor keep and surrounding village founded by the Impilturan family of Clan Maval.\n* Uthmere, the small coastal city that was wrecked by an earthquake but remained as a small village."
