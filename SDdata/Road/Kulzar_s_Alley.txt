'''Kulzar's Alley''' was an alley in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Description==
The alley was considered sufficiently safe for the rich inhabitants of the ward to walk by undisturbed. Like other alleys in the Sea Ward, it was clean and wide.

==Geography==
The alley started from [[Trollkill Street]] between [[Heroes' Walk]] and [[the Fanebar]], running into its city block until it arrived at [[Rook Alley]].

==History==
Kulzar's Alley was named after the Waterdhavian sailor [[Kulzar]], captain of the ''[[Lost Luck]]'', a ship that had broken up during a stormy night after running into shoals near Waterdeep. Kulzar was said to have immense strength and managed to swim to the shore while carrying his treasure. Kulzar died in the late 13{{th}} century [[DR]], sometime around the 1290's.

==Notable Locations==
* [[The Gildenfires]], a festhall that was out of use in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
* [[Roarke House]].
* [[Warehouse (Kulzar's Alley)|An unnamed warehouse]] that stood between Roarke House and the Gildenfires.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was rumored that Kulzar's treasure lay buried somewhere under the alley. Although the treasure had never been found, the legend attracted occasional treasure hunters and old sailors. However, any digging taking place in the alley was quickly stopped by the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]], whose main interest was to prevent tunnels from being dug under the [[Trollwall]]. Perpetrators were required to close off any dig sites and replace any removed pavement stones.
