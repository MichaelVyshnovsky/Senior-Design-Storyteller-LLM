The '''Eastways''' were three tunnels and roads that lead east from the [[drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]] to [[Fardrimm]] and [[Delzoun]].

==Menzoberranzan==
The Eastways were three tunnels that opened up in to the cavern of Menzoberranzan at the district of [[Donigarten]]. 

==Route==
The Eastways branched out into three main tunnels: the smallest and shortest led to the [[Driders' Chasm]], while the other two led north and east to the [[Fardrimm]] and fallen [[Delzoun]].
