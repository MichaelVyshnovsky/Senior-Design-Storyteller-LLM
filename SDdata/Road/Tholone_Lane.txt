Tholone Lane was a short cobbled street in Suzail that connected Silverscales Street to the south with Neresters Run to the northwest in an arch that slashed through a city block.
The large cobblestone area of the Tholone Lane that touched Silverscales Street was adorned with fishing-net drying racks, and the entire block on both sides of the Lane was quite dilapidated. All structures on the block showed signs of age most were three-story tallhouses of stone and lumber. Almost all ran businesses out of first floors and cellars, while the top floors were broken down into apartments. The tallhouses surrounding Tholone Lane belonged to middle-class merchants who sent rent collectors monthly but never showed more interest in the dockside property. Those who dwelled here were mostly aged sailors, minor merchants the sold smuggled goods, dockworkers, and other low-income folks.
Tholone Lane had several wagoncuts – shammer alleys barely big enough to squeeze a cart through. One cut through to Neresters Runs southern end, one cut to the street to the north, and four more – to the eastern Court Close.
The western building on the corner of a wagoncut with Neresters Run and Tholone Lane was an impressive building colloquially called "the Black Rock." Its permanent colors were due to the soot of three fires that charred the stone. However, it was not the color that was notable about it. The building was the biggest on the block, eccentrically decorated with stone-carved beast faces that, at some point, before the 14 century DR, behold to the Tireless Eyes trading coster. The buildings ground level was a glass-blowers store, and the basement – its worship. Immediately to its west was a hidden cellar entrance hidden by a garbage heap that led to the hidden temple of Valkur.
*Murrocks Fine Glass, or "the Black Rock" – a permanently blackened by fire stone storefront in the 14 century DR, before that – the headquarters of the Tireless Eyes trading coster.
*Valkurs Berth, a well-hidden half-flooded temple to Valkur that also housed a busy smuggling operation as of the 14 century DR.
