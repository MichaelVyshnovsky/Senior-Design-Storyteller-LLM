        "mainbody": "The '''Vale Road''' was the primary route leading north out of [[Hulburg]] on the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]], and connected the city to the farming community of [[Winterspear Vale]] and to [[Thar]] beyond.",
        "Geography": "The road originated in Hulburg. It passed through [[Harmach's Foot]], a square in [[Old Hulburg]], on its way north out of town. As it left the city, it turned east rather than cross at the [[Burned Bridge]], the junction with [[Keldon Way]], and remained on the eastern side of the [[Winterspear River]] heading north into the farmlands of Winterspear Vale. \n\nAfter about {{SI|3|miles|k|long=yes}}, the road passed through a narrow gap in [[Lendon's Dike]] as it neared [[Lake Hul]]. Rounding the lake, the road forked at an old dairy farm, with the road to [[Glister]] heading west into [[Thar]] and a cart track heading east and north into the [[Highfells]] to [[Garumn's Climb]] through the [[Galena Mountains]] to [[Vaasa]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}",
