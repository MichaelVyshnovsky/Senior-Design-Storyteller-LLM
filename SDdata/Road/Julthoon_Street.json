        "mainbody": "Julthoon Street was a major eastâ€“west thoroughfare in Waterdeep. It was the dividing line between the Sea Ward to the north and the Castle Ward to the south as of the Year of the Crumbling Keep, 1276 DR.\nJulthoon stretched from the cliffs of Gull Leap on the coast of the Sea of Swords to the High Road in the North Ward. At Gull Leap, Julthoon connected with Westwall Street and the Cliffride. Along the way to North Ward it touched or connected with many other streets and alleys including Jelzars Stride, Seaeyes March, Toalars Lane, Darselune Street, Gothal Street, Melshars Street, Haltovar Street, Tchozals Race, and Copper Street.\nSome points of interest along Julthoon Street included\n The Field of Triumph\n A huge stadium used for both official and entertainment purposes.\n The Spires of the Morning\n A beautiful temple dedicated to Lathander.\nIn the Year of the Raging Flame, 1255 DR, the walls protecting Waterdeep were expanded to keep up with the growth of the city. A portion of the new wall was built along the path of what would become Julthoon street when the walls were moved again in 1276 DR. At the western end of the street, a 90 ft (27 m) Walking Statue stood on Gull Leap until around the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR."
