        "History": "In the [[1255 DR|Year of the Raging Flame, 1255 DR]], the walls protecting Waterdeep were expanded to keep up with the growth of the city. A portion of the new wall was built along the path of what would become Julthoon street when the walls were moved again in 1276 DR. At the western end of the street, a 90 ft (27 m) [[Sahuagin Humbled|Walking Statue]] stood on Gull Leap until around the [[1370 DR|Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]]."
