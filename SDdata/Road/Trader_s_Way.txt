The '''Trader's Way''' (also seen as the '''Traders' Way'''{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|58}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 48: The Road to Khôltar, Part 1}}) was a caravan road that connected with the [[Golden Road]] at [[Kormul]] in [[the Shaar]].

==Geography==
Traveling south from Kormul, it passed by the [[Wyrmbones]] and crossed the [[River Talar]]. Turning east, it passed through [[Rethmar]] and [[Channathgate]] before climbing the [[Landrise]] and reaching [[Three Swords]], [[Eartheart]], and [[Delzimmer]] before turning south to end at [[Cathyr]] in [[Dambrath]].

The Trader's Way skirted the eastern edge of the [[Forest of Amtar]] which was a favorite place for bandits to prey on caravans that were not adequately guarded. For those traveling lightly with goods that fit on muleback, guides could be hired in [[Khôltar]] or [[Delzimmer]] for escort along this stretch, staying well to the east of the road (and the forest) using the cairns as landmarks.

The Trader's Way also met the [[Dunsel Trail]] at Eartheart.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|67}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 53: Khôltar, Part 4, Our Tour Begins}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|83}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 63: Khôltar, Part 14, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 1}}

==Description==
This road was characterized by numerous [[wikipedia:en:Cairn|cairns]], pinnacles, and crags that shepherded caravans along the Way. They could be found irregularly spaced all along the eastern side of the road (technically the north side when the road was heading in an east-west direction) and helped travelers navigate when dust storms kicked up.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|59-60}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 49: The Road to Khôltar, Part 2}} At least three of these cairns or pinnacles, just north and west of [[Delzimmer]], had names: [[Harboot's Tooth]], [[Knife (location)|the Knife]], and [[Daustable's Morrum]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|58-59}}
