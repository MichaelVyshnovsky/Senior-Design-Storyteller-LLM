'''Lamp Street''' was a short, curving avenue in [[Waterdeep]] that spanned the length of the city's [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]] and had a small segment in the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]].

==Location==
This road extended west off of [[Andamaar's Street]], corduroy-log paving, and curved southward until it terminated at the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]]. From there the road continued westward, where it was paved with packed earth and gravel pavement, intersecting through the main avenues of the [[Street of Bells]] and [[Street of the Sword]], the alleyway [[Elsambul's Lane]], and finally terminating on the eastern side of the main avenue [[Warrior's Way]].

==Notable Locations==
* On the corner of Lamp Street's Intersection with Elsambul's Lane stood a residential building owned by a member of the [[Harpers]]. It acted as a safe-house for that organization and contained a secret room that would ''[[teleport]]'' one to [[Harpers' Hold]].{{Cite dragon/211/"I Sing a Song by the Deep-Water Bay"|32}}
