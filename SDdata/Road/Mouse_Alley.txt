'''Mouse Alley''' was a short, curving minor avenue of hard-packed earth and [[gravel]]

==Geography==
This curving road linked the street of [[Blackcloak Alley]] to [[Brian's Street]]. East of it, the street [[Fishwife Alley]] ran roughly parallel.

==History==
An alleged event prior to the 13{{th}} century [[DR]] was the origin of both this alleyway's name and its status as a sacred site. The story went that [[Ahghairon]], the first [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep, was one day chasing a [[mouse]] down this alley that he believed to be a ''[[shapechange]]d'' [[wizard|sorceress]]. After catching the mouse, it transformed before Ahghairon and revealed itself to be the goddess Mystra.

Years later a prideful [[wizard]] by the name of [[Thunturn]] came to this alley with the intent of challengeing Mystra for mastery over all [[magic]]. The goddess answered his challenge and left him humbled, his hair jet black from fright and his magic all stripped away.

In the 14{{th}} century DR, [[Ruufdeidel Ressatar]] could usually be found lounging against a wall in this alley, waiting for someone to hire him for his informant services.

==Reputation==
It was said that worshipers of Mystra might receive aid from her in this alley or that she would punish anyone trying to harm her faithful that took refuge in the alley.
