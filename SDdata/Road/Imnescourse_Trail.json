        "mainbody": "Imnescourse Trail was a roadway that ran across central Amn. The western most point of the trail was at the town of Imnescar where it met with the Trade Way, then it ran east, along the edge of the Umar Hills through the town of Gambiton, linking with the South Road, before turning north and ending at the city of Esmeltaran. \nThe section of the Imnescourse Trail that runs though the Umar Hills was very dangerous. The area was full of wolves and possibly a werewolf.\nCategoryRoads\nCategoryLocations in Amn\nCategoryLocations in the Swordbelt\nCategoryLocations in the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryLocations in West Faer√ªn\nCategoryLocations on the Trade Way\nCategoryLocations in the Small Teeth\n0nmxfdhl3kbgd45rbef3w9k8k2vrn0n"
