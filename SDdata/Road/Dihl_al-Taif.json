        "mainbody": "Dihl al-Taif, or the Ghosts Route, was a trade route located in Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nThe portion of Dihl al-Taif found within mighty Huzuz was called the Caravan Boulevard.\nCaravans travelling by Dihl al-Taif followed Al-Sarif River east from Huzuz for  before heading north into the Haunted Lands. Another  of travel through harsh desert brought them to the small village of Zarif. Zarif was the last chance to re-supply for hundreds of miles.\nAfter departing Zarif, several days of travel brought the caravan to the Oasis of Solitude. This oasis marked the last source of fresh water before reaching Al-Malih River. A  stretch of barren wasteland greeted the caravan before the land finally began to turn green again where it met Al-Malih River, which flowed northeast directly toward Halwa for another .\nThough rife with danger, this heavily trafficked trade route was the quickest way to transport goods between Halwa and Huzuz."
