The Godsmoot was a wide street that ran diagonally northeast-by-southwest through the Temple District in the city of Athkatla. Like the names of many streets in the temple district, the name "Godsmoot" hearkened to a time before the 14 century DR when the ward of Athkatla was full of holy houses to gods like Azuth, Ilmater, and Tymora.
The northeast end of the street turned into Sarlannus Street, which verged northward, and the Street of Seven Altars, which continued northeast.
