        "mainbody": "he Lapal Way was a road that ran through Lapaliiya in southwest Faer√ªn in the 14th century DR, broadly following the coast of the Shining Sea. It was a vital road for the realm.\nFrom west to east, it linked Sammaresh, Malaxer, Abreon, Uzurr, Lhazantal, Zashuma, Ithmong, Mierskar, Lushpool, and Sheirlantar.\nBefore Shierlantar, the road crossed the River Talar at the Mouth of Istishia, a natural arch used as a bridge. Named for the goddess, it was wide enough for three carts to cross at the same time. Small towers stood at each end, garrisoned with well-armed soldiers to guarantee safe passage."
