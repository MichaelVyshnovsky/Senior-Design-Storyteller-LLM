The Cliffride was a street in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep that crawled up the north spur of Mount Waterdeep.
The Cliffride was located on the seaward side of the northern spur of Mount Waterdeep. It began at Julthoon Street and climbed in a southeasterly direction until it reached New Olamn bardic college (established in the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR). It was paved with gravel and very steep. It became even more treacherous in winter when covered in snow or when ice tended to form on everything the sea spray touched.
Map labels refer to the map above, circa the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR.
