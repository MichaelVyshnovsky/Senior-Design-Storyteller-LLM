The '''Trade Way''' was a long, well traveled trade road along the west coast of [[Faerûn]].  

==Geography==
The Trade Way started at [[Calimport]] in the south and traveled along the coast line all the way north to [[Waterdeep]]. The section of road between [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Tethyr]] was also known as the [[Coast Way]] on some maps.

===Lakes and ponds===
; [[Waypost Water]] : A small pond about half a days ride north of [[Daggerford]].

==Notable locations==
===Inns and taverns===
; [[Way Inn]] : Half a days ride south of [[Bowshot]].
; [[Friendly Arm Inn]] : A walled hamlet on the Coast Way, between Baldur's Gate and the town of Beregost.

==Travel times or distances==
* Bowshot to the Way Inn; ''half a days ride, north''.
* Daggerford to the Way Inn; ''two days hard ride, or about 100 miles, south of Daggerford''.

==History==
After the [[Spellplague]], traffic to [[Luskan]] and Calimport was nearly non-existent but the Trade Way remained in use from Waterdeep to the southern edges of Tethyr.  The Trade Way was no longer considered safe and [[paladin]]s from [[Elturgard]] guarded the crossing at the Winding Water River.  Caravan guards were considered a necessity and were in constant demand.
