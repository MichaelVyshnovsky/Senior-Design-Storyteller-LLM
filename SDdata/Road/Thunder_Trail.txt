The '''Thunder Trail''' was a short overland route in eastern [[Cormyr]] that began at the [[East Way]] just east of [[Masoner's Bridge]] and before it entered [[Hullack Forest]]. The trail headed north between the [[Immerflow]] and the forest's edge and climbed into the [[Thunder Peaks]] north of the forest.
