'''Black Dog Alley''' was an alley in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Geography==
The alley was a loop inside the southern part of a city block in the northeastern corner of the North Ward, delimited by [[Tower March]] to the north, the [[Trollmarch]] to the east, [[Stallion Street]] to the south, and [[Immar Street]] to the west. The northern access point to Black Dog Alley was another looping alley known as [[Watch Alley]]. Other access points existed from the Trollmarch and Immar Street as well.

==History==
The alley was named after the silent [[ghost]] of a black [[dog]] that could frequently be seen roaming the alley at night. The dog, which was as tall as a [[goat]], wore a spiked [[collar (animal)|collar]] and had flaming red eyes. It ignored people and objects, just walking past or through them.

==Notable Locations==
*[[Sunrise Tower]], or more colloquially known as the "Mad Tower" – an asylum for persons of addled or sick mind open in the 15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-12-18 - Insane Asylums in Waterdeep}}

==Inhabitants==
Like most alleys in the North Ward, Black Dog Alley was very safe. It was frequented by the occasional drunk who wanted to sleep undisturbed, as well as lone [[lantern guide]]s. It was considered safe enough for children to play unattended during nights of the full [[Selûne (moon)|moon]].
