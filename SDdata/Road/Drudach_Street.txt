'''Drudach Street''' was the major road of the [[Calimport|Calishite]] city of [[Manshaka]]. It ran west to east and effectively divided the city in half with four [[sabban]]s on each side. It ran from the gate of the city to its port region at the coast of the [[Shining Sea]].<ref name=EotSS-p111/>
