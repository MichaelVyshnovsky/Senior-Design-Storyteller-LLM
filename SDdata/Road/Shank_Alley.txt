'''Shank Alley''' was an alleyway of hard-packed earth and [[gravel]]<ref group="note" name="Name">The map within the 1{{st}}-edition sourcebook ''[[City System]]'' misprinted this location's name as '''Shark Alley'''.

==Geography==

Crowded by many stacks of crates containing [[fish]], this alley was often visited by [[bird]]s seeking to feed. Local youths were known to throw sticks and stones at these birds, killing them either to eat themselves or sell to a cook. Visitors skilled with [[sling]]s were known to do the same.

==History==
Prior to the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], this alley was often frequented by [[thieves]] who wielded [[shank (weapon)|shanks]].

==Notable Locations==
In the center of this alley stood a manhole opening to a surface shaft of the [[sewers of Waterdeep|city sewers]].
