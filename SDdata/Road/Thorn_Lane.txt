'''Thorn Lane''' was one of many shady alleyways that could be found in the city of [[Yartar]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activity==
Among the alleyways of Yartar, Thorn Lane was particularly known for being congested during the day, and even more so during the night, by [[coin-lass]]es and their gentleman callers. As a humorous colloquialism, Yartarrans referred to the area as being where people went to "improve their cultural relations."
