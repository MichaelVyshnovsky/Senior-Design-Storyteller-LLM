Karen Court was a major street that crossed the entirety of The Shutters neighborhood in the Crows End District of Ravens Bluff from east to west.
Karen Court ran parallel to Hammerstone Street and Red Sails Way, that formed The Shutterss southern border. It began at Mraedaras Street in the east and crossed Stonekeep Concourse, Burning Shield Lane, Landleen Lane, Helhavryns Walk, Castles Way, and Deepaxe Way, reaching its end at the muddy bank of the Fire River.
*Fish Tails, a fried fishcake factory, two doors west from The Last Jack near the Ravensbridge.
*Fruits & More, a grocer located next-door to Muldryns Chainworks on Karen Court. It specialized in sugars, jams, and compotes, as well as crude berry-infused cordials.
*The Last Jack, a quiet inn with a safe taproom located on the riverside where Stonekeep Concourse and Mraedaras Street crossed.
