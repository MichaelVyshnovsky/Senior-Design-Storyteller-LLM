'''Karen Court''' was a major street that crossed the entirety of [[Ravens Bluff/The Shutters|The Shutters]] neighborhood in the [[Ravens Bluff/Crow's End|Crow's End]] District of [[Ravens Bluff]] from east to west.

==Geography==
Karen Court ran parallel to [[Hammerstone Street]] and [[Red Sails Way]], that formed The Shutters's southern border. It began at [[Mraedara's Street]] in the east and crossed [[Stonekeep Concourse]], [[Burning Shield Lane]], [[Landleen Lane]], [[Helhavryn's Walk]], [[Castles Way]], and [[Deepaxe Way]], reaching its end at the muddy bank of the [[Fire River]].

==Notable Locations==
*[[Fish Tails]], a fried [[fishcake]] factory, two doors west from [[The Last Jack]] near the [[Ravensbridge]].
*[[Fruits & More]], a grocer located next-door to [[Muldryn's Chainworks]] on Karen Court. It specialized in [[sugar]]s, [[jam]]s, and [[compote]]s, as well as crude [[berry]]-infused [[cordials]].
*[[The Last Jack]], a quiet inn with a safe taproom located on the riverside where Stonekeep Concourse and Mraedara's Street crossed.
