After the fall of Myth Drannor in the [[Weeping War]], the Street of the Evening Star ended is a massive pile of rubble that once were the buildings of the northern part of the city surrounding Shaundakul's temple. The Street of the Evening Star intersected with the [[Dragoneyes Street]] immediately to the north of the Caste.\n\nThe Street of the Evening Star separated the [[Nightingale Court]] from the Castle cormanthor and the rest of the City Heights to the northeast, and ran past the [[Windrider Glade]] plaza.",
