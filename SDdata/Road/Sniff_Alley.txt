Sniff Alley was a small corner alley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.
Sniff Alley was located in the northcentral section of Waterdeeps Sea Ward. It cut the corner between the Street of Glances and both Gorl Street and Sighing Maidens Walk.
An entry into the Waterdeep sewers was found on Sniff Alley beside its lone tree.
The alley was named for a perpetual pile of rotting fishbones that was present until the Lords of Waterdeep enacted new laws about piling garbage.
