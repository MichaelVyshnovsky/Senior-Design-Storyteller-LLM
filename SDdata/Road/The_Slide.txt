The Slide was a small steep side road located in the city of Waterdeep.
The Slide was found in southern Waterdeep within the Dock Ward. It originated on Belnimbras Street near the intersection with Eel Street and branched south and east, cutting the main intersection with Sakiirs Street to connect with that road several buildings to the south.
The road derived its name from the icy and slick conditions it experienced during the winter months. When ice combined with the streets steep incline, pedestrians often went for an unplanned ride.
