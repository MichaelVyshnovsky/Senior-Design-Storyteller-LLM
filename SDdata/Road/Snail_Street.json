From there, Snail Street curved southeast, eventually terminating at [[Pressbow Lane]].\n\nAlong the way to its destination, Snail Street acted as an eastern and western terminus for a large number of smaller lanes and alleyways. In the Castle Ward, it acted as the western terminus of [[Crossbow Lane]], [[Niles Way]] and [[Rainrun Street]]. In the Trades Ward, roads that ended on the east side of Snail Street included [[Scroll Street]] and [[Simple's Street]].\n\nIn the Dock Ward, Snail Street acted as the eastern terminus of, in descending order, [[Blackstar Lane]], [[Spiderweb Alley]], Fish Street, [[Presper Street]], and [[Shrimp Alley]].
