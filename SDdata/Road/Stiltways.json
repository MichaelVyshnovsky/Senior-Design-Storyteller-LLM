        "mainbody": "The Stiltways was a unique street and marketplace found in Yhaunn in the 14 century DR. It was a microcosm of Yhaunns physical and social structure, with poverty and wealth piled up  vertically in a cramped space.\nThe Stiltways was located in the eastern region of Yhaunn near the docks.\nThe shops within the Stiltways were crowded together into four story shacks that were accessed by an ever-changing maze of ramps, ladders, bridges and chutes. The bottom levels were perpetually in shadow and dominated by crime and poverty, while the upper levels were prosperous and respectable. However, at night, it was scandalous for those with good reputations to visit even the highest levels .\n*Cutters Dip A shabby and violent tavern on the third level.\n*Fanters A fine tailor shop on the fourth level.\n*Skys Mantle A high-quality tavern located on the fifth level."
