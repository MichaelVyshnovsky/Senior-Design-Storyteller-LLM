        "mainbody": "The '''Stiltways''' was a unique street and marketplace found in [[Yhaunn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was a microcosm of Yhaunn's physical and social structure, with poverty and wealth piled up  vertically in a cramped space.",
        "Locations": "*[[Cutter's Dip]]: A shabby and violent tavern on the third level.\n*[[Fanter's]]: A fine tailor shop on the fourth level.\n*[[Sky's Mantle]]: A high-quality tavern located on the fifth level.",
        "Description": "The shops within the Stiltways were crowded together into four story shacks that were accessed by an ever-changing maze of ramps, ladders, bridges and chutes. The bottom levels were perpetually in shadow and dominated by crime and poverty, while the upper levels were prosperous and respectable. However, at night, it was scandalous for those with good reputations to visit even the highest levels ."
