        "mainbody": "The '''Northfurrow''' was a [[wagon]] trail running between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Goldenfields]].",
        "Description": "The trail ran parallel to the west bank of the [[River Dessarin]], passing between the [[Stump Bog]] and the [[Sarcrag]].",
        "Trade": "The Northfurrow facilitated the heavily guarded transport of food from Goldenfields south to Waterdeep, and subsequently the return of empty wagons back the way they came. The trail got especially busy after the harvest season.",
        "Inhabitants": "Along both sides of the trail were rural cottages and farmsteads owned by the Northfurrowers, as the local [[human]]s and [[halfling]]s referred to themselves."
