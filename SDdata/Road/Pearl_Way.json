        "Description": "Cargo departing [[Huzuz]] for the [[Pearl Cities]] traveled by ship across the southern portion of [[Zakharan seas|Suq Bay]], sailing west through the northern reaches of the [[Zakharan seas|Golden Gulf]], usually directly toward [[Tajar]], before continuing south to the rest of the Pearl Cities.",
        "History": "Given the precious cargo departing both the Pearl Cities and Huzuz, this was the richest trade route in all of Zakhara.\n\nRepresentatives from the Pearl Cities aggressively pursued pirates, so they were not much of a threat for merchants compared to other areas of Zakhara. However, vicious storms were known to strike the Golden Gulf and threaten ships. Communities of [[sahuagin]] inhabited the floor of the Golden Gulf as well, but they usually only attacked ships veering away from the coasts into deeper water."
