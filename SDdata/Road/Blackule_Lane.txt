The '''Blackule Lane''' was a street in the [[Blacklake District]] of [[Neverwinter]].

==History==
As of [[1480 DR]], the Blackule Lane was one of the few streets still operational in Neverwinter after the [[Ruining]] of [[1451 DR]].As the material in ''[[Ed Greenwood Presents Elminster's Forgotten Realms]]'' is intended to be useful regardless of what [[Dungeons & Dragons]] edition one may be playing, this implies that Blackule Lane must have survived the destruction of most of Neverwinter during the storyline that took place in 4th-edition.

==Notable Locations==
* The [[Starshine Academy]]
