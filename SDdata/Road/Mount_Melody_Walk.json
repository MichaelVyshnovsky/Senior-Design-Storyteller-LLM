The tunnel contained a little-known portal between Waterdeep and the keep in [[Rassalantar]].\n\nThe tunnel was continuously resounding with music due to an ongoing concert known as the [[Neverending String of Pearls]] that was performed by [[bard]]ic students from New Olamn in a small alcove in the tunnel."
