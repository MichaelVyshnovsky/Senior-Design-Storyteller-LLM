Urcandle Alley was a short alleyway of hard-packed dirt and gravel in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep, named for an individual who had long been forgotten by the 14 century DR.
This alleyway ran due south off of the Court of the White Bull and terminated on Sorn Street.
Urcandle Alley was home to one of the greatest concentrations of wheelwright stores in Waterdeep. They sold a wide variety of cables, drovers whips, harnesses, reins, ropes, cables, spare wagon wheels, and other such wheelwright items.
All this wagon related activity also made Urcandle Alley a frequent meeting spot for members of the Wheelwrights Guild and the Wagon-makers and Coach Builders Guild.
