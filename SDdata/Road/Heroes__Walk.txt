'''Heroes' Walk''' was a cobblestone,<ref name=CoS.M" /> U-shaped street that encircled [[Heroes' Garden]] in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].<ref name=CoS.M" />

==Geography==
This street both began and terminated at [[Trollkill Street]], forming with it a ring around Heroes' Garden.<ref name=CoS.M" />

On its eastern side, Heroes' Walk was a terminus to [[Phastal Street]] and [[Staghunter's Way]].<ref group="note" name="error">Map 5 of the ''[[City System]]'' sourcebook, as seen in the infobox, as well as the ''[[City of Splendors (boxed set)|City of Splendors]]'' poster map display the street [[Staghunter's Way]] as connecting to Heroes' Walk. In addition, the [[Realms by Night]] article [http://web.archive.org/web/20040917064917/http://www.wizards.com/ForgottenRealms/DnD_RBN_007.asp Kahla the Ghost of Heroes' Garden] states that [[Selchoun's Sundries Shop]] is located on Staghunters' Way. The map from ''[[Waterdeep: Dragon Heist]]'' incorrectly shows the Street of Glances as continuing on to Heroes' Walk. The road then went on to act as a terminus on its southwestern end to [[Ivory Street]], on its southern end to [[Mendever Street]], and on its southeastern end to [[Skulls Street]].<ref name=CoS.M" />{{Cite web/Realms by Night/Part Seven: Kahla the Ghost of Heroes' Garden}}

==Activities==
Every year during the summer, Heroes' Garden and Heroes' Walk were both overtaken by the nobles of the [[Church of Siamorphe]] on their holy day, the [[Divine Pageantry]].

==Notable Locations==
* Heroes' Garden
* [[Tower of Yintros]], a school of [[wizardry]] that from [[1066 DR]] to [[1306 DR]] occupied the space that would later be taken by the Heroes' Garden.
