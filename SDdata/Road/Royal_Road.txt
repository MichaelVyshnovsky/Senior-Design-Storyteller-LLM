The Royal Road was a long, well-traveled road that spanned the Easting Coast in southern Impiltur.
The main stretch of the road was surrounded by the green and fertile farmlands that covered most of the southern reach of Impiltur. It extended northeast from Lyrabar, which was located just outside the Gray Forest, and continued through the coastal city of Hlammach, north along the coast of the Easting Reach to New Sarshel.
