'''Black Wagon Alley''' was a small backalley that was located in the city of [[Waterdeep]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Waterdeep}}

==Location==
Black Wagon Alley was located in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]]. It originated on [[Book Street]], branching east to terminate at several dead ends in between Book Street and the [[Way of the Dragon (Waterdeep)|Way of the Dragon]].

==History==
The houses lining Black Wagon Alley were the homes of destitute citizens of the City of Splendors. As such, [[thieves]] lurked in the shadows and often set trip and strangle wires for unsuspecting victims, especially on the eastern end of the alley. [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] patrols were often busy clearing such traps.

The alley was named for a ghostly black [[plague wagon]] that was sometimes witnessed moving slowly and silently along the road without a [[horse]] or driver. It was said that any who encountered the wagon risked catching [[cackle fever]].
