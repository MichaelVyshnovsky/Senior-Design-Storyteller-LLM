        "mainbody": "Hmurs Way was the sole major clear roadway in the underwater city of Myth Nantar.\nHmurs Way was most likely named for Hmur, a mythical figure among the merfolk of Ser√¥s that was said to have been the first of them created by Eadro and the namesake of the Hmur Plateau.\nThis road was paved in blaze coral and depicted mosaics that over time broke down in appearance. Like the other major roadways of Myth Nantar, it measured  in width. It spanned west from the lowest slope of Mount Halaath to the Fire Fountain at the citys central square."
