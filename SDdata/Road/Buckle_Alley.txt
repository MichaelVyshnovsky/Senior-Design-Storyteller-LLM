Buckle Alley was an alley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.
Buckle Alley was located in the eastern section of Waterdeeps Castle Ward. It originated in the east on the High Road on the border with the Trades Ward where it branched west through the Sea Ward, crossing the Street of Bells, the Street of the Sword, and Warriors Way before terminating on the Street of Silver.
The alley was named for guards being reminded to buckle their sword belts before stepping foot onto the alley as it was once the home of the Shadow Thieves in Waterdeep.
