'''Asmagh's Alley''' was a backalley that was located in the city of [[Waterdeep]].{{Cite interactive atlas|Waterdeep}}

"Each ward has its own history, legends, and traditions based around who lived there in the past, famous or infamous events, and the uncanny things that continue to occur. For example, children (and even some adults) hop on one foot when crossing Asmagh's Alley in the Castle Ward. Why? Well, Asmagh was an apothecary who poisoned many patients, then buried them upright beneath the alley under cover of night. He was discovered, and some say that as many as eighty bodies were subsequently pulled up from holes under the alley's wide flagstones. Though this happened over a century ago, children passing through the alley still sing a song: “Hop for the hollows, hop for the dead, hop on the flagstones, hop on their heads.” As you stroll down Warrior's Way or the Street of Silver, listen for the children's delighted screams and go give it a try." -Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion (Waterdeep: Dragon Heist)
