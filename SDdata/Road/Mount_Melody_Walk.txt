Melody Mount Walk was a magically lit tunnel in the Castle Ward of Waterdeep that ran west up to the cliffs on which the New Olamn barding college was situated. The tunnel contained a little-known portal between Waterdeep and the keep in Rassalantar.
The tunnel was continuously resounding with music due to an ongoing concert known as the Neverending String of Pearls that was performed by bardic students from New Olamn in a small alcove in the tunnel.
