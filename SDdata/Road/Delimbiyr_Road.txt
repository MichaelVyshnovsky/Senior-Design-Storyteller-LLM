The Delimbiyr Road, also known as the Delimbiyr Route and the Shining Trail, was a trade road in the Delimbiyr Vale that ran from Loudwater in the east to the Trade Way in the west.In The North Guide to the Savage Frontier, the description of the Delimbiyr Route states incorrectly that the Route meets up with the "High Road south of Zundbridge" when in fact it is the Trade Way that runs south of Zundbridge.
It roughly followed the route of the River Delimbiyr from its northern banks, taking in the settlements of Loudwater, Zelbross (at about the halfway point), and Secomber. In the west, it joined the Trade Way near Julkoun, and a short trail led south to Daggerford. East of Loudwater, it joined the Dawn Pass Trail. The road was roughly  wide and was formed of hard-packed earth with deep wagon ruts. Tall grasses and wildflowers covered the sides of the road, but trees were prevented from growing right up to the edge of the road by outriders from passing caravans.
