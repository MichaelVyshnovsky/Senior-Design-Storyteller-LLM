Ilisars Alley was a small back alley that was located in the city of Waterdeep. It was sometimes miscalled as Illimars Alley, and its old name was Grave Alley.
Ilisars Alley was located in the northern section of Waterdeeps Southern Ward. The alley branched south from Telshambras Street at the border with the Trades Ward, cut west through a neighborhood, then turned north to reconnect with Telshambras Street.
The Stone House, which was the guild headquarters for the Carpenters, Roofers, & Plaisterers Guild, was located on the eastern side of Ilisars Alley where it branched from Telshambras Street.
Prior to the establishment of gates to the City of the Dead by the wizard Anacaster to facilitate travel there, the poorest of Waterdeeps citizens used this alley as a graveyard, hence the original name of Grave Alley. To preserve space, coffins were buried vertically, with one corpse under each flagstone. The practice was eventually abandoned after it led to undead bursting from beneath the street.
The alley was renamed for a Waterdhavian tailor named Ilisar, who became inexplicably wealthy and purchased the whole block. After he died of blacktongue fever, it was rumored that he had hidden or buried his wealth somewhere in one of the buildings on the alley.
As of the mid-to-late century DR, there were rumors that ghouls, skeletons, wights, and zombies left over from the alleys days as a graveyard would still occasionally emerge to haunt the area.
