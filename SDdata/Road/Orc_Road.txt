The '''Orc Road''' was the thoroughfare between [[Amn]]ian cities of [[Crimmor]] and [[Purskul]].

==Description==
[[File:Zehoarastria.png|thumb|''The location of the Orc Road in Amn.''|390x390px]]
The Orc Road was the name given to a patch of the [[Trade Way]] in [[Zehoarastria]] region between Crimmor and Purskul. Farms, family estates, and small agricultural communities filled the stretch of the road, providing the two cities with grains and produce.

==History==
The road's name derived from it being used by [[orc]]ish hoards that descended from the [[Cloud Peaks]] several times through Amn's history, including the {{YearlinkName|1235}} and the {{YearlinkName|1241}}. These two events lead to a large [[half-orc]] population in the town of Purskul and the nearby communities. Orc survivors from the failed invasions were enslaved, and their labor was used to pave and maintain the Orc Road.

Sometime ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1270}}, brutal Lord [[Alathallgo Gathalynker]] of the [[Gathalynker]] family was murdered and, allegedly, eaten by his orcish slaves on the Orc Road. The Lord's body was hastily buried somewhere along the road. In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Alathallgo's skull adorned in his ornate [[enchanted]] [[helmet]] was unearthed, but the rest of magical [[armor]] and other wondrous items were still believed lost, and buried along the Orc Road. As of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Gathalynkers continued the search for Alathallgo's magical equipment under cover of night, despite the local government's protests and drovers driving their carriages into excavated holes late into the evening.

==Notable Locations==
*[[Flagonsrich Estate]], known for its large gardens and vineyards to the west. As the Orc Road crossed the estate's grounds, a massive ''[[holy symbol]]'' of [[Chauntea]] constructed out of living multi-colored [[rose]]s could be seen from afar brain a major landmark of the area.
