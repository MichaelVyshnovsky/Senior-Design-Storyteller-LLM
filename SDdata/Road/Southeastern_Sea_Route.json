        "mainbody": "The Southeastern Sea Route was a trade route located in Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nThe Southeastern Sea Route exited Huzuz along Al-Sarif River and traveled south through Suq Bay, entering the Golden Gulf before turning southeast toward the Cities of the Pantheon.\nAs with the Pearl Way, the main danger along the Southeastern Sea Route was storms. Few pirates frequented the waters along the trade route.\nTrade with the Pantheist League was not lucrative compared to the other trade routes flowing through Huzuz, but the Grand Caliph liked to maintain positive diplomatic relations with the Pantheists."
