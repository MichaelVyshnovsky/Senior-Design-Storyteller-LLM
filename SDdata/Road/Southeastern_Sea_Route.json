        "Description": "The Southeastern Sea Route exited [[Huzuz]] along [[Al-Sarif River]] and traveled south through [[Zakharan seas|Suq Bay]], entering the [[Zakharan seas|Golden Gulf]] before turning southeast toward the [[Cities of the Pantheon]].",
        "History": "As with the [[Pearl Way]], the main danger along the Southeastern Sea Route was storms. Few pirates frequented the waters along the trade route.\n\nTrade with the Pantheist League was not lucrative compared to the other trade routes flowing through Huzuz, but the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] liked to maintain positive diplomatic relations with the Pantheists."
