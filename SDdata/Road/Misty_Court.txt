'''Misty Court''' was a humble and perpetually foggy street in the [[Tumbledown]] district of [[Baldur's Gate]]'s [[Outer City]].

==History==
In the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, on [[Kythorn 28]], was visited by [[Tav]], an adventuring detective who was investigating a series of grizzly murders. One of the dead bodies was fished out of [[River Chionthar]], wrapped in a tarp taken from one of the workshops on Misty Court. Tav found the open-air stonemason's workshop called [[Alabaster Stonecrafts]]. The twins who ran the workshop told the investigator that strange happenings had been plaguing the nearby [[Cliffside Cemetery]], claiming that the gravedigger â€“ [[Grom Skullsmash]], was responsible, or the [[ghost]]s.

==Notable Locations==
*[[Alabaster Stonecrafts]], the workshop of "Sister" and "Brother Alabaster" in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
