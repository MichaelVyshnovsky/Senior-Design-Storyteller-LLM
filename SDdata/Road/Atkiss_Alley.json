        "mainbody": "tkiss Alley was a minor avenue, partially of cobblestone and partially of hard-packed earth and gravel, in the Trades Ward of Waterdeep.\nThis curving road ran from north to south, connecting Quaff Alley with Virgins Square, while crossing through Scroll Street. As it crossed through Scroll Street and terminated at Virgins Square, the road transition from gravel to cobblestone.\nThis alley was often used by the well dressed men of the upper class and frequently patrolled by the City Watch, the latter of which largely dissuaded cutpurses from lurking in the alley."
