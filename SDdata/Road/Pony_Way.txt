Pony Way was a minor avenue of rock and gravel in the North Ward of Waterdeep.
Pony Way ran from north to south, shooting off south from the corduroy-log paved road Immar Street, and terminating at a cobblestone paved avenue by the name of Saerdoun Street.
Along the way, Pony Way was intersected from the east by Stallion Street and from the west by Horn Street.
