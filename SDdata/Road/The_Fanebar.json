        "mainbody": "he Fanebar was a corduroy-log paved, short alleyway in the northern section of the Sea Ward of Waterdeep.\nThis alleyway ran from northeast to southwest, coming off of Trollkill Street and terminating at Skulls Street. Towards the middle of the Fanebar a narrow passageway opened off its eastern side into Rook Alley.\n* At the southernmost corner of the Fanebar, at the passageway leading into Rook Alley and Kulzars Alley, there rested a stone half-hidden under a downspout. If that stone were activated, it would act as a portal to Maldiglasâ€™s Refuge."
