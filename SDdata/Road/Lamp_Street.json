        "mainbody": "Lamp Street was a short, curving avenue in Waterdeep that spanned the length of the citys Castle Ward and had a small segment in the Trades Ward.\nThis road extended west off of Andamaars Street, corduroy-log paving, and curved southward until it terminated at the High Road. From there the road continued westward, where it was paved with packed earth and gravel pavement, intersecting through the main avenues of the Street of Bells and Street of the Sword, the alleyway Elsambuls Lane, and finally terminating on the eastern side of the main avenue Warriors Way.\n* On the corner of Lamp Streets Intersection with Elsambuls Lane stood a residential building owned by a member of the Harpers. It acted as a safe-house for that organization and contained a secret room that would teleport one to Harpers Hold."
