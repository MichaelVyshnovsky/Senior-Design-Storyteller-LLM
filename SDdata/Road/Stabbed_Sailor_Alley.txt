Stabbed Sailor Alley, which was also simply called the Stabbed Sailor, was a small alley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.
Stabbed Sailor Alley was located in the southern section of Waterdeeps North Ward. The alley branched east from Vhezoar Street, joining Shattercrock Alley after passing Margaster Villa, and finally ending on Whaelgond Way. Little Street and Sprangalars Swordcut connected with the north side of Stabbed Sailor Alley.
A cluster of large shadowtop trees towering to nearly  ensured the alley was always shaded.
This alley was the scene of a violent clash between Waterdeeps citizens and members of the Cult of the Dancing Bear.
