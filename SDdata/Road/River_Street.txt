'''River Street''' was a cobblestone-paved major avenue of the [[Waterdeep/Trades Ward|Trades Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]], as well as the road that those going through [[River Gate]] entered or exited the city on.

==Geography==
River Street ran from east to west, starting at River Gate by coming off of [[Undercliff Way]] and terminating in the west on the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]]. At the beginning of the street, on either side of the River Gate, it was the terminus to [[Wall Street]] and [[Wall Way]], two roads that ran along the [[Trollwall]]. Towards its midsection it became the northern terminus of [[Buckle Street]] and west of that it was intersected by [[Salabar Street]].
