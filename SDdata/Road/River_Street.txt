River Street was a cobblestone-paved major avenue of the Trades Ward of Waterdeep, as well as the road that those going through River Gate entered or exited the city on.
River Street ran from east to west, starting at River Gate by coming off of Undercliff Way and terminating in the west on the High Road. At the beginning of the street, on either side of the River Gate, it was the terminus to Wall Street and Wall Way, two roads that ran along the Trollwall. Towards its midsection it became the northern terminus of Buckle Street and west of that it was intersected by Salabar Street.
