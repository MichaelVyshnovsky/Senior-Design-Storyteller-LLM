Shattrcrock Alley was a small alley that was located in the city of Waterdeep.
Shattercrock Alley was located in the southern section of Waterdeeps North Ward. The alley branched south off of Stabbed Sailor Alley, reconnecting with the alley after encircling Margaster Villa.
The alley was named appropriately when a wizard, one Phantamos of the Purple Cloak, was learning to fly and crashed wildly through a cart of crockery.
