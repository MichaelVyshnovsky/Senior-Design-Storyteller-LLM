The '''Risen Road''' was a long road that connected the metropolis of [[Baldur's Gate]] with the city of [[Elturel]].{{Template:Cite game/Baldur's Gate III}}

==Geography==
The road was located north of the [[River Chionthar]], running parallel with its route.

==Notable Locations==
* [[Waukeen's Rest]], an inn that obscured a hidden refuge of the [[Zhentarim]].
* [[Moonrise Towers]], the fortified home of the [[High Heralds]] of [[Faerûn]].
* [[Shattered Sanctum]], a [[Selûnite]] temple that fell to ruin.
* [[Moonhaven]], a town that formed around the temple.

==History==
As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], many travelers preferred the road over traveling the Chionthar by river barge.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a number of [[githyanki]] and their [[red dragon]] steed blocked passageway across the road as they searched for the [[Astral Prism]], an artifact lost to their people.
