        "mainbody": "he Street of the Learned, or the University Road, was located in Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.\nThis street was so named because it provided the most direct route for students commuting to the ferries that crossed Al-Sarif River to the great university, Al-Bidir Sallah. The Street of the Learned was adjacent to the Street of the Ajami in the Craft District, passing northeast though the district to exit the city and connect with the River Road and the ferries."
