        "mainbody": "The Hunt Trail ran through the Vast, connecting the towns of Ylraphon and Kurth.\nFrom west to east, it began at Ylraphon, passed the Flooded Forest, ran through the village of Tavilar and the hills of Beluars Hunt and ended at Kurth. On the way, it joined the Pass Trail and the North Road.\nThe minstrel Lieshann, traveling from Tavilar to Kurth, once took a wrong turn onto the trail to the Mages Tower, having mistaken it for the Hunt Trail."
