'''Zendulth Street''', formerly known as '''Zenduth Street''' until its name had been corrupted over time,{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-11-14 - Some Unlabeled North Ward Roads}} was a major and extensive street in the city of [[Waterdeep]] that began in the city's [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]]

==Geography==
This street began in the North Ward at the intersection of [[Golden Serpent Street]], [[Saerdoun Street]], and the [[Cliffwatch]]. It ran southwest off of them and, like the former two roads, Zendulth Street was initially paved in cobblestone. It became paved in hard-packed dirt and [[gravel]] for a block after passing its first gate into the City of the Dead, then became paved in corduroy-logs as it reached its second gate.

Along the way to that second gate, the road was met from the south by [[Beacon Street]]Across the editions this street went unlabeled on maps of Waterdeep. It was only revealed by [[Ed Greenwood]] on November 14{{th}}, 2021. then from the north by [[Mhalsymber's Way]] and [[Sammarin's Street]]. Once passing the western end of Sammarin's Street, this avenue became part of the Trades Ward as it passed through [[Andamaar's Street]].

Zendulth Street would continue to be paved in corduroy-logs for the majority of its length, becoming briefly cobblestone as it cut through the eastern end of the [[Coffinmarch]] and its entrance to the City of the Dead. On its way to the Coffinmarch, the road was met from the west by [[Selduth Street]], and a block after passing the Coffinmarch it would be met by [[Ironpost Street]]. Finally, Zendulth Street ended at the southwestern corner of the City of the Dead, at an intersection of [[Burnt Wagon Way]] and [[Wall Way]].

==Notable Locations==
;[[Dunblast Roofing Company]]: A carpentry business that stood at the corner of Ironpost Street and Zendulth Street until the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], at which point the business moved to the corner of Zendulth Street and the Coffinmarch.
