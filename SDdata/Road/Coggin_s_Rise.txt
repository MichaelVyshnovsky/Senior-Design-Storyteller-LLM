'''Coggin's Rise''' was a trail that ran through the hills from [[Stagwick]] to [[Castle Hartwick]]. The hills in the region were covered with white-barked [[aspen]]s. It took between a half hour and an hour to travel the full distance by horse.

==History==
It was off Coggin's Rise where Princess [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]] and her [[firbolg]] bodyguard [[Morten]] were ambushed by [[Ice Spire ogre]]s led by [[Goboka]] in [[1366 DR]].
