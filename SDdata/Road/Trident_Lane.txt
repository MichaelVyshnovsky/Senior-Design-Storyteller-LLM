'''Trident Lane''' was a dockside street in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].

==Description==
[[File:Trident Lane map.jpg|thumb|''A map sowing the location of Trident Lane.''|265x265px]]
Trident Lane was a short street on the shore southwest of the [[Seatower of Balduran]]. Further southwest from it was the [[Silver Crescent Beach]]{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220221195407/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Nov â€“ Dec 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}} The [[Fury of the Fist]] stature stood on Trident Lane and the lane itself was home to many businesses and weaponsmiths who serviced the [[Flaming Fist]] and its families who resided in the district. One such shop was run by a sentient [[automaton]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1477}}, ''circa'' [[Kythorn 19]], the city of Baldur's Gate was shuddered by a series of grizzly murders perpetrated by the [[dragonborn]] only known as [[the Dark Urge]]. One of the victims left being a distinct-looking sacrificial dagger. The adventuring detective named [[Tav]] visited the construct smith of Trident Lane on [[Kythorn 30]], seeking the information on the possible murder weapon. The automaton claimed it didn't recognize the blade but a certain [[githyanki]] gravedigger attempted to custom-order such a blade. The smith pointed Tav towards a mages' shop on the other side of the city to where it sent the gravedigger.
