In the summer of the , circa Kythorn 19, the city of Baldurs Gate was shuddered by a series of grizzly murders perpetrated by the dragonborn only known as the Dark Urge. One of the victims left being a distinct-looking sacrificial dagger. The adventuring detective named Tav visited the construct smith of Trident Lane on Kythorn 30, seeking the information on the possible murder weapon.
