The '''High Road''', largely known to citizens as just '''the High''',{{Cite dragon/410/Eye on the Realms: The Talking Door|29}} was one of the main streets of [[Waterdeep]], connecting its southern and northern regions. Together with the other boulevards that ran through the city in the north-south direction, it was heavily trafficked, and one of the main routes of the city's [[dray]]s and [[hire-coach]]es.

==Geography==
The High Road started at the [[South Gate (Waterdeep)|South Gate]] of Waterdeep, where it continued south as the [[Trade Way]]. From there it led northward, crossing the city and exiting it from the [[North Gate (Waterdeep)|North Gate]], from where it continued north along the [[Sword Coast North]] as the [[High Road|road of the same name]].

==Notable Locations==
In southern Waterdeep, the intersection between the High Road and the [[Way of the Dragon (Waterdeep)|Way of the Dragon]] was known as the [[Waymoot (Waterdeep)|Waymoot]]. A [[magic]] signpost at the center of the intersection indicated the direction and distance to locations outside the city. [[Berendarr's World of Words]], a [[broadsheet]] store, was located here.{{Cite web/Realmslore/Broadcryers of Waterdeep I: News for Sale}}
