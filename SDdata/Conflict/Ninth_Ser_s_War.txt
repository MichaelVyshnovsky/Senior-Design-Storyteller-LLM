The '''Ninth Serôs War''' was a conflict fought between the [[merfolk]] realm of [[Hmurrath]] and the [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]] [[Axe Kingdoms]] of [[Khuur]] and [[Nmalk]], in the undersea land of [[Serôs]] in the 6th century [[DR]].

==History==
===Background===
In the [[582 DR|Year of the Deep Wound, 582 DR]], [[Tarag]], a chieftain of the sea [[ogre]]s, used the powers of the sword [[Ilbratha|''Ilbratha'']] and his own battle strategies to conquer the western frontiers of the [[merfolk]] realm of [[Hmurrath]]. There, Tarag founded the two Axe Kingdoms of Khuur and Nmalk.

===The war===
The Axe Kingdoms and Hmurrath fell to fighting in the [[653 DR|Year of the Killing Blow, 653 DR]], beginning the Ninth Serôs War.

The merrow suffered a major defeat in the [[Battle of the Haunted Plains]] in the [[654 DR|Year of the Coveted Briars, 654 DR]]. Following their defeat, four-fifths of all merrow in Serôs were forced to flee south to the other side of the [[Sharksbane Wall]]. The rest survived on the [[Hmur Plateau]] or living amidst the ruins on the [[Haunted Plains]].

Three years of conflict culminated in the destruction of the Axe Kingdoms and the fall of the merrow to the merfolk of Hmurrath in the [[655 DR|Year of the Volanth, 655 DR]]. This saw the end of merrow "civilization" in Serôs.
