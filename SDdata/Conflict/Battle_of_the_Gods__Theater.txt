The '''Battle of the Gods' Theater''' was a costly conflict during the [[Crown Wars]].  Circa {{Yearlink|-10700}}, after peace failed, the [[Elf|elves]] of [[Shantel Othreier]] fought to defend their lands from the acquisitive and corrupt [[Vyshaan]] of [[Aryvandaar]].  Into this already-bloody conflict, located in what is now the [[Tunlands]], poured an enormous horde of [[Orc|orcs]].  Shantel Othreier paid the price, and the northern half of the nation was occupied by Aryvandaar.

A century later, [[Coronal]] [[Ynloeth]] died under mysterious circumstances, and Aryvandaar seized control of Shantel Othreier.
