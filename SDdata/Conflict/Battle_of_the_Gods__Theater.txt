The Battle of the Gods Theater was a costly conflict during the Crown Wars.  Circa , after peace failed, the elves of Shantel Othreier fought to defend their lands from the acquisitive and corrupt Vyshaan of Aryvandaar.  Into this already-bloody conflict, located in what is now the Tunlands, poured an enormous horde of orcs.  Shantel Othreier paid the price, and the northern half of the nation was occupied by Aryvandaar.
A century later, Coronal Ynloeth died under mysterious circumstances, and Aryvandaar seized control of Shantel Othreier.
