The '''Rotting War''' was a civil war fought in [[Chondath]] from [[900 DR]] to the {{YearlinkName|902}}, between the coastal and inland city-states of the nation.

==Conflicts==
In [[901 DR]], arch wizards of [[Arrabar]] and [[Reth]] joined the war, reigning devastation and death using ancient [[Netherese]] magics. In 902 DR, troops from Reth clashed in combat with the joint armies of Arrabar and [[Hlath]] in the [[Fields of Nun]], in the foothills of the [[Akanapeaks]]. The rulers of Chondathan cities craved an easy win and ordered their wizards to summon deadly [[necromantic]] plagues. The resulting epidemic killed two-thirds of the Chondathan armies in minutes.

Many of the battles were chronicled by three [[bard]]s. Each warred with one of the three participating armies. At a later date, they became known as the [[Bards of Nun]]. Notably, each of the bards independently recorded the appearance of the Lord of Battles [[Tempus]] on the [[Fields of Nun]] before the faithful [[Battle of Nun|clash]]. The avatar rode on a skeletal steed, dripping blood on the battlefield. Each of the three armies' generals took it as a good omen â€“ god of war on a white [[steed]].

==Aftermath==
The members of the Chondathan army who survived took the plague home, spreading the deadly disease. Eventually entire counties and baronies were wiped out as a result of the mysterious plagues, especially in the area known as [[Chondalwood]]. This devastating outcome of the Rotting Wars ensured Arrabar's loss of influence.

The nation of Chondath renounced its claims on [[Sembian]] cities<ref> and fractured, with all its cities having declared independence and returning to their old statuses as loosely allied city-states. This included the cities of [[Chancelgaunt]], [[Saerloon|Chondathan]], and [[Sespech]]. The only city not to declare independence was [[Iljak]].

Centuries later, it was speculated that a surviving sample of the Rotting War's plagues may have been the cause of the Great Plague of [[1317 DR]].
