        "mainbody": "{{otheruses4|the Hellish civil war|the various dating systems|Marking the years}}\nThe '''Reckoning''', sometimes called the '''Reckoning of Hell''', was a rebellion orchestrated by many [[archdevil]]s to depose [[Asmodeus]] from his seat as ruler of the [[Nine Hells]]. The conflict reshaped much of Baator's political landscape.",
        "Location": "The conflict began in the layer of [[Avernus]], but successive battles permeated the other layers until [[Maladomini]].",
        "History": {
            "Causes": "In the early days of the [[Blood War]], the archdevils moved their troops more freely between the different layers of Baator. Internal power struggles caused them to split into two factions: the first was led by [[Mephistopheles]], followed by [[Mammon]], [[Dispater]] and [[Geryon]]; the second was led by [[Baalzebul]], followed by [[Zariel]], [[Belial]] and [[Moloch]]. Each faction aimed at overthrowing the other in order to challenge Asmodeus for rulership.",
            "Battle": "The conflict started in earnest when Zariel led a massive contingent, thought to be aimed at [[demon]]s, to attack [[Dis]] instead. At the same time, Moloch and Belial led their armies into [[Stygia]]. In response, Mephistopheles attacked Maladomini, while Mammon lifted the siege on Dis. This counter-offensive turned the tides of the battle, forcing Zariel to retreat and Baalzebul to call for reinforcements.\n\nIn Maladomini, both forces sent massive legions to attack each other in an enormous battle, as their leaders started to see victory approaching and the deposition of Asmodeus at hand. However, Geryon had secretly remained loyal to the Lord of [[Nessus]]. Together, they amassed the loyalty of the [[pit fiend]] commanders of both armies, who, at Geryon's signal, turned against their commanders and obliterated both armies.",
            "Aftermath": "Asmodeus emerged unscathed from the conflict. [[Mammon]], on the other hand, quickly switched sides, humbling himself before Asmodeus and invoking the mistrust of all the other archdevils. [[Mephistopheles]] also managed to maintain his original position as Lord of [[Cania]].\n\nOther changes in power happened as a consequence of the Reckoning. [[Baalzebul]] was demoted from his seat as Lord of [[Malbolge]], a position later filled by Asmodeus's daughter, [[Glasya]], under the condition that her relationship with Mammon ended. All the dukes of Malbolge, who were under the sway of Baalzebul, were also demoted.\n\nIn addition, Asmodeus rewarded the pit fiend generals who remained loyal to him, creating the company known as the [[Dark Eight]]."
