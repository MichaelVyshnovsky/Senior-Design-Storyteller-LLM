        "mainbody": "An extended war between the Shadovar and Thay was fought over the city of Neverwinter in the mid-to-late 15 century DR. While the two main participants were Thay and the Shadovar of Thultanthar, later the revived empire of Netheril, the war was actually a secret conflict between several factions for dominion over Neverwinter that resulted from the New Neverwinter movement, including the Abolethic Sovereignty, Ashmadai, and Kingdom of Many-Arrows. As a result, while all the conflict in the war was undoubtedly centered around the Netherese and Thayans, there were in fact, several factions all at war with each other.\nIt ultimately ended in a lack of resolution between the Shadovar and Thayans, but a victory for Waterdeep and Neverwinter.\nWith the Spellplague well underway in the , the city of Neverwinter was crumbling. Using the upheaval to mask their efforts, the Shadovar sent the Shard of Night to Neverwinter and stationed it there until they would need it.\nAs of the 1450s DR, during the lordship of Hugo Babris, the city of Neverwinter was finally rebuilding itself. In the , after receiving reports that Xinlenal, the first Netherese enclave, could be located somewhere within Neverwinter Wood, the Princes of Shade commanded that the Shadovar go after it. They sent their tiefling warlord Herzgo Alegni to excavate the first enclave. After Alegni and his forces arrived at Neverwinter, and especially after Alegni sacked Helms Hold, none in Neverwinter dared move against any shade. Since his objective was in Neverwinter Wood, Alegni allowed Babris to continue to rule the city. Instead, Alegni ordered his slave assassin Barrabus the Gray to coerce Babris into renaming the Winged Wyvern Bridge the \"Herzgo Alegni Bridge\". Alegni planned on using Barrabus to deal with the elves in Neverwinter Wood and scout out some holes near the excavation site.\nMeanwhile, on the orders of Szass Tam, an upstart but growing cult of Ashmadai operated in Neverwinter Wood to trouble the Netherese. To fuel her Dread Ring, Valindra Shadowmantle and Dahlia Sinfelle arranged the awakening of the primordial Maegera, which triggered the eruption of Mount Hotenow and the Ruining of Neverwinter.\nThis was the opening of conflict between the Shadovar and the Thayans, as the destruction of Neverwinter effectively negated Alegni his claim on Neverwinter.\nThe devastation of Neverwinter also tore open a great chasm through the city. This rift reached the depths of the Underdark, to an underground sea where the Abolethic Sovereignty was experimenting on the Spellplague and the creatures of Neverwinter. With the Chasm open, aboleth activity on the surface dramatically increased with more monsters being experimented on and people being plagued with hallucinations and nightmares, though this was nothing compared to what the Sovereignty planned to enact. Since their operations risked being exposed, the aboleths bolstered their defenses and sent some of their early experiments to the surface to discourage adventurers from traveling down the Chasm.\nFor eleven years, the Netherese search for Xinlenal continued, but no longer under Alegni, who had faced severe disciplining for his inaction against Thay. Finally, in the , Alegni was once again placed in charge of the expedition, with the added objective of stopping Sylora Salm from completing the Dread Ring. Due to Szass Tam possessing a holy scepter of Asmodeus, the Ashmadai followed the leadership of Salm. In Gauntlgrym, the Ashmadai summoned the pit fiend Beealtimatuche, who killed Thibbledorf Pwent and Bruenor Battlehammer. Despite this, Salm failed to use Maegera.\nDue to Syloras aggression against Netheril and Alegnis operations being close to the Dread Ring, the tiefling was able to seize control and become the lead general of the Shadovar against Szass Tam. Tyrannically taking lordship over Neverwinter, Alegni decided to forge an army with which to fight Valindra and created the White Guard, led by Jelvus Grinch, and the Shadow Guard, led by his Netherese lieutenants. Another player had entered the war by this time, the Abolethic Sovereignty. Invadiah sent Arunika to corrupt the Sovereigntys Brother Anthus, but she was corrupted instead. Arunika proceeded to work with Thay and seduced Herzgo Alegni. Eventually, Entreri, Drizzt DoUrden, and Dahlia attacked Alegni, defeating him and forcing him to forfeit Charons Claw. Arriving at Gauntlgrym once more, the Shadovar started an assault against House Xorlarrin as Entreri destroyed Charons Claw. There, Dahlia also killed Herzgo Alegni, stalling Shadovar advances, forcing them out of Neverwinter. Brother Anthus later killed Arunika for her relationship with Alegni.\nAlthough the war against Thay had been stalled, Draygo Quick and Effron Alegni were given the option of continuing it immediately. Instead, due to Effron wanting to leave the Shadovar and Quick being more interested in finding Chosen for Telamont Tanthul, the Netherese were left with no general against Valindra. As such, the war, the Thayans, and the Netherese faded out of Neverwinter for the time being.\nIn the , Lord Dagult Neverember arrived in Neverwinter and, on behalf of the Lords of Waterdeep, immediately took control of the situation there. Neverember took advantage of the damage caused by the Thayans and Netherese to rebuild the city with his hired hands and mercenaries. Neverembers New Neverwinter movement was pure propaganda to stir up nationalistic feelings within the population. Although Neverember desired to take control of Neverwinter, he was aware that simply doing so would cause his support to dry up. Instead, Neverember hoped to offer the people new facilities, market opportunities, access to goods, work, and safety and so make them feel indebted and grateful towards him and, when the time was right, hopefully beg him to be king. However, Neverember did not disclose these plans to anyone not critically involved in them. Mindful that if any possible heirs to the throne came forth, his chances at becoming king would be ruined, Neverember kept a reliable network of spies to watch and report on any claimants. Neverembers savants managed to trace his own lineage back to Vers Never, a bastard son of Nasher Alagondar and give him a direct claim to the throne. Knowing that his word alone would not be enough, Neverember ordered the creation of books to link him to the royal line.\nThe arrival of Neverember and the ensuing flurry of activity drew the attention of the Sovereignty, with the aboleths seeing the reconstruction of Neverwinter as a threat to their plans. It also drew the attention of Jarlaxle Baenre, who set loose his Bregan Daerthe spies to operate in Neverwinter.\nMeanwhile, Valindras rebuilding crew worked tirelessly to repair the damaged areas of the Dread Ring. In her spare time, Valindra studied the nature of the Dread Ring so that she could one day restore it or give it a new purpose. She learned that Neverwinter Wood was the perfect location for a Dread Ring because the land surged with magical energy due to the bones of Lorragauth, an ancient black dragon.\nSimilarly, Netherese interests around Neverwinter became much more serious after Prince Clariburnus Tanthul himself decided to lead the effort to restore Xinlenal, which Herzgo Alegni had failed to do. Although Clariburnus had a variety of different schemes, all led back to Xinlenal. Few even knew the Netherese had returned and even fewer knew why, with the Netherese headstrong on restoring the enclave. Arriving in Neverwinter Wood, the Netherese were confronted by the Uthgardt Gray Wolf tribe, but by playing to tribal traditions managed to convince the barbarians to join up with them.\nNot all Neverwintans trusted Neverembers beneficent smile many of those whod refused to abandon the city following its destruction banded together as the Sons of Alagondar. Swearing loyalty to Neverwinter, despite going up against a much larger cause, the Sons of Alagondar traced their lineage back to Nasher Alagondars loyalist servants and were content. Leading the Sons of Alagondar was none other than a member of the Harpers known as Cymril, from around 1472 DR. Under Cymril, the Sons of Alagondars actions were nonviolent but annoying in nature by creating minor sabotages, stealing supplies and embarrassing mercenaries.\nIn the late 1470s DR, the Thayans and Netherese struggled for territory in the Shadowfell. By the time the Netherese had detected the Thayan incursion into the Shadowfell, Valindras forces had already established a base in Evernight. However, the undead of Evernight dealt with both sides and remained neutral in the conflict, requiring only that fighting not take place in their city. Meanwhile, their fighting in Neverwinter Wood became a war of attrition.\nFor twenty years, the orc population of Neverwinter Wood had begun to rise again until finally King Obould XVII of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows sent his vanguard Vansi Bloodscar to explore operations in the area. Rather than report back to Obould, Bloodscar took over the Cloak Tower and claimed northern Neverwinter for Many-Arrows.\nCirca 1479 DR, Neverember mounted reprisals against the Sons of Alagondar, resulting in the death of Cymril. This was a huge blow against the rebels, causing a power vacuum and internal conflict. Scattered, the Sons of Alagondar movement would have perished had they not found allies in the Dead Rats gang and received funds from the Thayans.\nLed by Rsolk, the Dead Rats made a lair in the sewers of the city to further their attempts at a criminal empire. As an end goal, the Dead Rats hoped to usurp the Sons of Alagondar and take control of Neverwinter. Recent events, however, had split the Sons of Alagondar into the Nashers and the Graycloaks. To ensure Neverembers distraction, Valindra continued to fund the Nashers foir their more violent approach, which included assassination, riots, and sabotage. Under Arlon Bladeshaper, the Nashers found themselves at odds with the more diplomatic Graycloaks. Skilled at bribery, infiltration and forgery, the Graycloaks wanted to pressure Neverember into relinquishing power to the civilians. The Graycloaks found themselves led by Madame Rosene. Despite being fractured, the Nashers and Graycloaks did continue to communicate with each other.\nTaking his role as Lord Protector seriously, Neverember sent his mercenaries to oust the orcs from the River District and the plaguechanged monstrosities at the Wall. Beyond establishing laws and keeping peace, Neverember considered it his goal to root out any rebels as well. Aware that installing forces from Waterdeep would fuel the rebellion, Neverember relied on soldiers from Mintarn led by General Sabine. A natural delegator, Neverember left the citys policing, defense and security to Sabine, who ruthlessly quashed disturbances and eradicated leaders. In addition, Neverember installed Soman Galt as the mayor of the city. However, with his power in Neverwinter growing, Neverember ultimately relinquished much power in Waterdeep, visiting the Masked Lords irregularly.\nWith Cymrils death, the Harpers experienced yet another setback in the region as their relationship with the Sons of Alagondar had become strained. With only around eleven members in the region, of whom only two were agents, the Harpers spent most of their time trying to figure out how to unite the rebels under a single cause once more. Their minor presence meant they too knew nothing of the Thayan or Netherese activities.\nTo the aboleths, the returning refugees simply proved to be a larger body of people on whom they could experiment. Neverember was completely unaware of the work of the Abolethic Sovereignty and that they were sending minions to keep him busy he only knew that the plaguechanged were Spellplague monstrosities. The Sovereignty collected these plaguechanged creatures to join their fledgling Symphony of Madness, with selected members serving as conduits for the Spellplagues energy.\nAware of the implications of finding Gauntlgrym, Neverember began to send scouts out to find the ancient dwarven homeland. A colony of illithids, unaware they were being aided by the Abolethic Sovereignty, retook Gauntlgryms lower levels. Using the Symphony of Madness, the aboleths controlled the illithids elder brain but their continued control began to mutate the mind flayers. Also present in Gauntlgrym were the duergar, who knew not why there were even there, but enjoyed mining the hellthorn. An even more dangerous faction, the drow of House Xorlarrin, also neared the caverns of Gauntlgrym.\nHaving not seen their holy scepter in some time, the Ashmadai believed Valindra to have spirited it away—unaware that Szass Tam had reclaimed it. The Ashmadai split into two sects those slavishly loyal to Asmodeous and those who cared more about acquiring power than paying homage to it. The former group, led by Favria, served Thay as the scepters holder. The less fanatical branch, led by Mordai Vell, was responsible for the rise of the Ashmadai as a shady, manipulative powerhouse in Neverwinter. The two sects rarely interacted, with their members not even aware of each other. Nevertheless, Favria and Mordai Vell often met up to discuss future machinations. It was in this way that the Ashmadai operated under the nose of Valindra Shadowmantle. Although they still payed lip service to Thay, under Mordai Vell, the Ashmadai advanced their own plots. Favrias branch were little more than thugs. Either as daylight leaders or through secret intimidation, Vell desired to control Neverwinter. Lacking numbers, however, Vell was aware he could not operate openly in the city and thus devised a pod system. Becoming more aggressive, Vell instructed his followers to mark shellacked buildings and corpses with the symbol of Asmodeous, hoping to terrorized the people into submission. Despite Favrias personal opinions, Vells plans worked like a charm.\nThe Ashmadai made proposed alliances to Neverember, which he mostly accepted. Since he knew little about the Ashmadai, however, Neverember did not reveal much to them. Underestimating their power, Neverember believed he could use them. Conversely, the Ashmadai began to turn Neverembers own people to their cause, by controlling most of the mercenaries guarding the Chasm and wooing a handful of Neverembers close retainers. This effort went all the way to the top, with Mordai Vell personally pursuing General Sabine. Ultimately, Vell hoped to induct Neverember himself.\nOne of Valindras many sanctums lay beneath Castle Never, where she and her servants prepared the bodies of the Neverwinter Nine for a special sort of animation. Around this time, Valindra battled a beholder named Talgath at Castle Never, which damaged a portion of the castles staterooms. At Neverdeath, Valindra animated dozens of bodies at a time. Using a special ritual, the Thayans marched the undead through the Shadowfell. From there, the undead would either go join the labor force at the Dread Ring or battle the Netherese in the Shadowfell or at Thays borders. Using the center of Neverdeath as a means of travel to the Shadowfell via a shadow crossing, Valindra created a teleportation circle for this very purpose. Desiring to dig up the remains of Lorragauth, Valindra forced the Cult of the Dragon, led by Adimond Kroskas, to aid her in her efforts at creating a dracolich. However, since the ritual to create a dracolich could only be done on living dragons, Valindra hoped that a restored Dread Ring would supercharge her and allow her to raise Lorragauth.\nAfter hearing reports that the Thayans had returned to the city, Neverember had General Sabine investigate. However, no definitive answer came back and Neverember remained ignorant to the Thayan presence—much to Valindras liking.\nCompletely ignorant of Netherese interests in the region, Neverember unwittingly hired several Shadovar agents to conduct discrete assassinations. Neverembers ignorance was such that he was entirely unaware that hundreds of shades, shadar-kai, humans, undead, and constructs were at work under Prince Clariburnus to unearth Xinlenal and restore it. This was mostly because few ventured as far into Neverwinter Wood as Xinlenal was buried. As the mythallar of Xinlenal was broken, Netherese spellcasters began to rebuild it using raw residuum. Scouring the region for the tools needed by the Shadovar, Clariburnus sought several powerful magical items from which he could get residuum. Sacking the ruins of Sharandar, the Netherese were able to keep the fey off guard and easily killed any eladrin elves that got in their way. With his hunt for magical items keeping him occupied, Clariburnus placed Orthinos Eln in charge of the excavation. Some Shadovar believed Ioulaum to still be alive and began to seek him out. Using the Shard of Night, the Shadovar fueled a teleportation ring in the tower to travel to and from the site of Xinlenal.\nWith conflict having reached the borders of Thay, Valindra sent undead against the Netherese, whom she saw as a threat to her plans and wished them obliterated. Clariburnus had already begun to plunder magical items from Thayan and Ashmadai forces. It was a significant ongoing military conflict on the Sword Coast North, yet the citizens of Neverwinter were oblivious to it.\nTo the citizens of Neverwinter, Thay was little more than a bedtime story, even though sightings of the Red Wizards of Thay began to increase in number. One of Neverembers spies, Seldra Tylmarande, obtained what she thought to be the true Crown of Neverwinter—actually a forgery. In 1479 DR, the Red Wizard Tolivast attempted to steal Seldras fake crown for Valindra and failed, but not before cursing to drive the wearer mad. Driven mad and creating the Lost Heir persona, Seldra began to try and take control of the city.\nThe Nashers later announced their alliance with the Dead Rats and the Lost Heir. After the Lost Heir saved people from plaguechanged abominations, Sabine hired adventurers to look into the so-called Lost Heir. After fighting the Dead Rats, the heroes gained an audience with Arlon Bladeshaper, then fought the Lost Heir and exposed her as Seldra. The heroes then defeated a plaguechanged white dragon that was awoken by Seldra.\nIn the , Tam Zawad, Aubrin Crownsilver, Mehen, Farideh, and Havilar arrived in Neverwinter. Arunikas sister, Rohini, was also sent by Invadiah to infiltrate the House of Knowledge and capture an aboleth. To do this, she killed Brother Anthus and seduced Brother Vartan but was angered to discover Farideh in her city. In the conflict that ensued, the Ashmadai slaughtered Glaysas Sixth Layer cultists Farideh and Havilar killed one of Mordai Vells top lieutenants, Yvon Claven and Vartan used the Hex Locus to convert Rohini into an agent of the aboleths—just like her sister had been converted years ago. Rohini was attacked directly by Invadiah but after losing the battle retreated into the Chasm.\nLater resurfacing, Rohini sought out and converted Soman Galt and made him an agent of the aboleths. With Galt firmly under their control, the aboleths determined that any emerging threats from the way of Neverember would be easy to stamp out. The aboleths hated the Ashmadai, but were content to let Mordai Vell operate and did not consider him a serious threat. The aboleths also began to siphon as much information as they could on Valindra in hopes of converting her. However, the aboleths were caeful not to make themselves known when dealing with Valindra or any Shadovar, for even they feared the powers of Szass Tam and Telamont Tanthul. Valindra was vaguely aware of the aboleths presence and was enraged that she knew so little about so powerful a faction, but despite her best efforts she found out little. Clariburnus, on the other hand, was aware of an unnatural presence, but did not care enough to even confirm that it was the Abolethic Sovereignty.\nHer primary purpose being stewardship of the Hex Locus, Rohini moved to Helms Hold to ensure that it would not be detected. She used the cathedral as a base of operations while collecting test subjects for the Symphony of Madness. She became the Prophet of Helms Hold, worshiped by those who lived at there and a mouthpiece for the aboleths, who created \"prophecies\" to influence the region. Rohinis biggest triumph came when none of Sabines men were able to slay the green dragon Chartilifax but she caught the dragon in thrall of her beauty. Rohini bestowed a kiss on him, forced her sorcerers to alter his form, and placed the mighty beast in her dungeons. With the Abolethic Sovereignty making overtures to Vansi Bloodscars orcs, Rohini beguiled the orc commander into accepting her blessing a spellscar with which she hoped to control the orcs.\nFeigning interest in Helms Hold, the Netherese began to use their Gray Wolf Uthgardt allies to infiltrate the cathedral so that, if they were ever exposed, the investigation would lead away from Xinlenal. Jurden Splitlip headed this effort and was responsible for several murders within the cathedral and even more kidnappings. Using information from their prisoners, the Gray Wolves created covers for themselves within Helms Hold and worked to create unrest so that Clariburnus could eventually sack the cathedral. While Clariburnus saw no need to directly pit himself against Neverember until he was ready to sack the city, the Shadovar did send spies to keep an eye on events.\nEngaged in a turf war with the aboleths, the Ashmadai wanted the Chasm closed. The Ashmadai took special efforts to act against the Abolethic Sovereignty. In his efforts to convert Soman Galt, Vell became suspicious of the mayor but wanted more evidence before he marked him for death. Vells pursuit of Sabine had begun to bear fruit as she visited his estate often. Even Neverember found Vells presence to be enjoyable, the two spending much time together. The Ashmadai wished to outmaneuver Thay and recover the holy scepter. Desiring Valindras phylactery, the Ashmadai wanted to kick the Thayans out and end the war with Netheril. To add further to their betrayal of Valindra, the Ashmadai often dealt with the Netherese in secret. Ultimately, Valindra continued to view the Ashmadai as tools or cannon fodder despite being aware they had their own ambitions. Clariburnus too saw the Ashmadai as Valindras tools, but Orthinos Eln believed they may have had their own aspirations and had dispatched a force to find out.\nEventually, the activities of the Ashmadai began to ramp up after they initiated Elden Vargas into their ranks. Convincing Vargas to send his insane wife, Karis, to Helms Hold, Mordai Vell then called in favors with Rohini to prevent him from seeing her. Turning on Vell, Vargas began to go by the title \"the Tormentor\" and began to mind control victims and brand them with the symbol of Asmodeous, so as to implicate Vells Ashmadai. Making it to Helms Hold, Vargas defeated the Prophet Rohini and placed Chartilifax under his control. At the top of Helms Hold, Chartilifax, Vargas and Karis were confronted by heroes who defeated the Tormentor.\nValindra also had some quarrels with the orc forces of Vansi Bloodscar. Instead of viewing them as an immediate threat, though, Valindra saw them as an irritation as only King Obould XVII raising his levies would warrant her attention.\nThe war with Thay had delayed Netherils efforts to recover Xinlenal, with Valindra sending her forces out into Neverwinter Wood to kill Clariburnuss soldiers. In return, the Prince of Shade attacked and damaged the Dread Ring. None of the Netherese attacks at the Dread Ring actually penetrated the fortress, but still slowed Thayan counterattacks. Clariburnus desired to shut down the Thayan portal to the Shadowfell and keep the Thayans reeling and unable to strike back. The Gray Wolves fought as frontline soldiers against the Thayans treated as expendable, they suffered heavy losses and started mistrusting Clariburnus. Some of the Gray Wolves attempted a mutiny, but this was easily quashed by Clariburnus. Escaping, these oathbreakers became known as the Forsworn and established a camp near Xinlenal, where they began to work against Netheril.\nTaking advantage of the attacks he ordered on the Dread Ring, Clariburnus sent the floating citadel Kolthunral to the skies over the edge of the Thayan Plateau. From there, the Netherese, led by Antethriss, rained death on the fortified city of Surcross. Clariburnus believed that if Surcross could fall, he could take the Thayan end of Shadowfell Road.\nBy 1484 DR, several aspects of the war had settled down. Bregan Daerthe had stopped operating in the city and was split between Luskan and Menzoberranzan for the Darkening, which also resulted in Many-Arrows orcs being drawn into the War of the Silver Marches. Netherese interests shifted elsewhere and they used their Sembian forces to capture Archendale. With the deaths of Rivalen Tanthul and Brennus Tanthul, it could be assumed that, on the Netherese side, the war began to dissipate.\nIn the , Thultanthar, the City of Shade, was destroyed the mind of Aglarel Tanthul was shattered Vattick Tanthul was killed and High Prince Telamont Tanthul was slain in the destruction. The Netherese were taken out of the war by outside circumstances, while Clariburnuss fate is unknown. \nAs a result of most of the factions being forced out of the city by the mid-1480s DR, the war between the Shadovar and the Thayans was effectively won by Neverwinter, as Neverember managed to keep holding the city despite losing his grip on Waterdeep.This Shadovar–Thay conflict and plotline established in Neverwinter Campaign Setting and other works of the 4-edition era appears to have been effectively dropped in the shift to 5 edition. Hence, the war is officially unresolved, so this article assumes the lack of events and outcome to be an outcome of sorts.\nOver the course of the war, several leaders arose at different times\n* Dahlia Sinfelle representing Thay, c. 1451 DR\n* Sylora Salm representing Thay, 1451 DR to 1462 DR\n* Valindra Shadowmantle representing Thay, 1462 DR onward\n* Herzgo Alegni representing Netheril, 1451 DR and 1462 DR\n* Prince Clariburnus Tanthul representing Netheril, 1467 DR onward\n* Lord Dagult Neverember representing Waterdeep and Neverwinter, 1467 DR onward\n* Soman Galt representing Waterdeep and Neverwinter, 1467 DR onward\n* General Sabine representing Waterdeep and Neverwinter, 1467 DR onward"
