        "mainbody": "The Legendary Campaign was a major military campaign waged in the Utter East It was a quest to unify the war-torn realms of the Utter East and bring peace to the land, albeit through yet more warfare. Notably, it was fought using basal golems mass-produced by bloodforges.The name of this conflict is taken from the name of the campaign in the Blood & Magic game it was not used in in-universe text. An alternative is the less-catchy \"Random Campaign\".The events of Blood & Magic are only dated to \"before the Time of Troubles\" (1358 DR) in game. It is assumed these are a part of the Bloodforge Wars described in Faces of Deception and dated in The Grand History of the Realms.\nthumb|250px|right|Its all about the bloodforges, baby.\nThe bloodforges were discovered in the Year of the Dancing Daggers, 648 DR, first by King Grewe of Konigheim and within tendays by Ffolk across all the Five Kingdoms. These ancient devices of war could mass-produce entire armies of living golems, eliminating overnight the cost of mustering and maintaining armed forces. Losing all restraint, turning war-mad, the Ffolk rulers of the Five Kingdoms each manufactured great golem armies and marched them against one another, bursting into the Bloodforge Wars. They were drawn into battle by thoughts of conquest and revenge, rivalry and intrigue. The kingdoms throve on the arcane magic of the bloodforges and were governed by military might.\nA number of conflicts large and small raged back and forth across the Utter East, with all sides commanding bloodforges and basal golem armies, the causes ranging from the serious to the frivolous. The power struggles were unending, kingdoms came and went, and their lands were devastated by war. In time, people at all levels of society hoped for a legendary leader who, regardless of whether their motives were virtuous, selfish, or immoral, could carry out the impossible quest of ending the wars, unifying the kingdoms, and bringing peace to the Utter East.\nWhat they got… was someone.This is of course the player of the Blood & Magic game. See Background, below, for more details. While the name is unknown, this wiki will refer to the character as simply \"leader\", and disregards the games final statement \"Your name shall be legend immortal!\". Its a silly name.\nthumb|250px|right|Living golems, forged for war, sounding familiar.\nEmerging from obscurity, this contender made a sovereign claim to rulership and swore to unify the realm and give mercy to anyone who recognized their claim. All the current rulers, of course, rejected it completely. Regardless, the new leader rallied their handful of basal golem followers and embarked on the Legendary Campaign. They engaged in bloodforge battles up and down the land, fighting rival claimants and warlords, challenging other bloodforge mages, aiding the needy, defeating the wicked, and attacking the good, and, in short, doing exactly the same as everyone else.The battles can be taken in any order, with only a progression of first, second, and third battle in any given map in the game. Thus, they will be presented in the following three phases, and collected in groups of three based on the geography of the earlier campaigns in Blood & Magic, but no particular order is intended. It is presumed the player-character is victorious each time for completion.\nThis leader would not be alone in this quest—there were others.
