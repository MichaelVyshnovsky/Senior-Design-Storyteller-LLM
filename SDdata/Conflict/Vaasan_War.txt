The '''Vaasan War''' was a decade-long conflict between the Kingdom of [[Damara]] and the Kingdom of [[Vaasa]] during the mid 14{{Th}} century [[DR]] in which [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] rose to power and successfully conquered both realms.

==Location==
The war began in Vaasa itself with Zhengyi's conquest of the [[Sunderland]] in the south and [[Ostraland]] in the north, but much of the war occurred on Damaran soil and climaxed at the [[Ford of Goliad]]. That said, [[Impiltur]] also felt the effects of the war with Zhengyi owing to the complete disruption of Damaran trade that it caused.

==History==
===Causes===
[[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] appeared in Vaasa and raised [[Castle Perilous]] in a single night in {{YearlinkName|1347}},<ref group="note">The [[Forgotten Realms]] campaign sets for both the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set|1st edition]] (set [[1357 DR]]) and [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition|2nd edition]] (set [[1368 DR]]) give Zhengyi's appearance as happening "20 years ago." The [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|3rd edition]] onward continued from the date established in the 2nd edition, and set the year as [[1347 DR]]. thus declaring himself ruler of a new Kingdom of Vaasa. He raised an [[undead]] army and quickly gained allegiance of the land's [[evil]] inhabitants, including the dreaded [[Citadel of Assassins]], and began a war of conquest across Vaasa and Damara.

===Battles===
====Conquest of Vaasa====
While the war did not arrive in Damara until {{YearlinkName|1348}}, the fighting began in {{YearlinkName|1347}}, when Zhengyi's forces conquered Vaasa immediately after the erection of Castle Perilous. while the southern town of [[Darmshall]] was the only settlement to withstand Zhengi's assault, but would become a puppet state of the Witch-King. At the same time, Zhengyi worked to cripple Damara's economy by dispatching [[demons]] to the [[Bloodstone Mines]]&mdash;a critical source of Damara's key export of [[bloodstone]] gems

====Invasion of Damara====
When the snows melted in early 1348 DR, the forces of Zhengyi's Kingdom of Vaasa crossed the [[Galena Mountains]] and began their invasion of Damara, committed atrocities and massacres everywhere they struck. The fighting was largely confined to Damara's northern duchies of [[Arcata]], [[Brandiar]], and what would become [[Soravia]]. 

Damaran defenses were somewhat disorganized. Most resistance took the form of militias led by local lords, including a young [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], who won every battle he led, and [[Kidaez Tahlard]], a nobleman who died early in the war when the forces of Vaasa encroached on his estate.{{Cite polyhedron/74/The Living City: The Ill Eagle Inn}} The Vaasan and Damaran forces fought many skirmishes, including a battle at [[High Moon]] wherein a mercenary company known as the [[Men of the Red Blade]] suffered losses.{{Cite polyhedron/46/The Living City: Skully's Bar and Bait|17}}

As the war dragged on, Damaran territory in the north, including [[Bloodstone Pass]], became increasingly cut off from the Kingdom of Damara. Even so, it was five years until the war truly began to turn against the Damarans. The first notable settlement to fall was [[Helmsdale]], a town of 500 that was decimated and became the Vaasan headquarters for the remainder of the war and beyond. A number of displaced and desperate refugees joined forces with bandits in the Galenas, and under the leadership of the Grandfather of Assassins, began pillaging and demanding tribute from surrounding towns, including [[Bloodstone Village]].

As the depredations of the Witch-King became clearer, the peoples of both [[Impiltur]] and [[Narfell]] grew increasingly concerned about Zhengyi's ambitions, but neither made any major effort to support Damara.

Despite minimal support from their neighbors, the Damarans held off Zhengyi for another four years. 

====The Battle of Goliad====
The two sides then arrived at an apparent stalemate during the summer of {{YearlinkName|1357}}, when the army of King [[Virdin Bloodfeathers]] met the Vaasan forces at the [[Ford of Goliad]]. This site was both the critical crossing point of the [[Beaumaris River]] and also a death trap for whichever army attempted to cross it while the other held the opposite side. The war had been tremendously costly for Damara to this point, and because of this, the young King Virdin was swayed to accept a gambit that he believed would allow him to surprise the Vaasan forces. The king was provided a [[magic]] [[wand]] that was meant to allow his troops to cross the river undetected, but in truth this was a ruse overseen by Zhengyi and the "wand" was a simple stick with twelve castings of ''[[Nystul's magic aura]]'' upon it. Thus the disastrous [[Battle of Goliad]] occurred and the army of Damara was slaughtered when they attempted to cross the Ford while King Virdin was assassinated as he watched the carnage in horror. Subsequently, it was widely believed that the king's chief lieutenant, [[Felix]], was Zhengyi's agent who both provided the "wand" to the king and was perhaps the assassin as well.

Zhengyi and his allies in the [[Citadel of Assassins]] quickly capitalized on their victory, leveling the town of [[Goliad]] In the [[Barony of Ostel]], the entirety of the ruling [[House Praka]] was killed, and likewise in the [[Barony of Polten]], Baron [[Donlevy the Old]] and all of [[House BelMaris]] were wiped out. With all leadership positions across the duchies thus now held by either puppets of Zhengyi or known cowards too scared to stand against him, the Witch-King quickly claimed control over all of Damara.

===Aftermath===
With most of Damara's experienced soldiers now dead and its leaders assassinated, the realm was unable to stand against Zhengyi any further. He claimed the northern duchies as his own, He further demanded that the southern baronies pay hefty tribute to his Kingdom of Vaasa, and hand-selected the rulers of most of these realms, sometimes selecting for loyalty but more often selecting for incompetence. The result was in-fighting between the southern rulers and heavy taxes on the people. While this arrangement was often considered a devious decision on his part, ensuring control of the northern regions (where most of Damara's mineral wealth was located) while leaving the southern regions unable to unite against him,

After consolidating his control, Zhengyi then turned his attention away from Damara as he plotted to grow his strength. Two years later, the [[Bloodstone Wars]] would erupt in Damara between the squabbling baronies.

==Combatants==
Zhengyi's army consisted of three main groups. The first were the [[demon]] and [[undead]] forces made available to him through his allegiance to [[Orcus]]. The second were the monstrous [[humanoids]], [[goblinoids]], and [[giants]] of Vaasa, who flocked to him when he first declared his rule over Vaasa. The last group included [[Vaasan]] [[humans]], such as the [[White Worm]] tribe and the [[Citadel of Assassins]]. 

King Virdin's army was comprised of the soldiers and militia of Damara, led by the Damaran nobility, with some very minor support of neighboring realms, namely [[Narfell]] and [[Impiltur]].
