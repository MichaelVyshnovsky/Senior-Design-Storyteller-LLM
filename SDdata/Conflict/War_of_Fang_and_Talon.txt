The '''War of Fang and Talon''' was a conflict between the [[dragon]]s and [[Primordial]]s of [[Abeir]].{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|78}}

==History==
The war began some time after the Primordials were granted the world of Abeir by Lord [[Ao]]. who were exhausted having lost most of their numbers in the [[Dawn War]] and the battle against the [[gods]] of [[Toril]] during the [[Tearfall]]. Unable to overcome their dragon steeds, the Primordials were quickly defeated and those who survived retreated into hiding and fell silent. Among the Primordials killed in the war were [[Nehushta]] and [[Petron]].

After having won their battle against the Primordials, the dragons turned against each other, and attacked the dragons who remained loyal to the Primordials as well. When the war came to an end, most of Abeir was laid to waste and only a handful of dragon lords survived.
