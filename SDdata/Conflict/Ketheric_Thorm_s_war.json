Raphael promised to get rid of Ketheric's army in exchange for Morfred's soul. Morfred accepted the offer and was transferred to the [[House of Hope]] where he stayed ever since as an eternal debtor of the [[cambion]].\n\nRaphael fulfilled the deal, sending [[orthon]] [[Yurgir]] and his [[merregon]]s to Grymforge. Within the ''[[Sharran's Journal]]'', there was an account of one of Dark Justiciars witnessing Yurgir's onslaught. Most of the Sharrans were wiped out during the first day. The others continued to fight back or hide for some time as the author of the ''[[Abandoned Journal]]''. The garrisons of the Gauntlet of Shar and of Grymforge slipped out of existence, but Yurgir's contract would remain unfulfilled until [[1492 DR]] as, unknown to him, Raphael had also made a contract with one of Dark Justiciars called [[Lyrthindor]], hiding his presence from the orthon and foredooming Yurgir to wander the Sharran temple for over a century.",
            "Shadow Curse": "[[File:Statue of Ketheric Thorm.png|thumb|Statue of Ketheric Thorm in [[Reithwin]] after the [[Shadow-cursed lands|shadow curse]] was cast upon the town.]]\nFollowing the near-complete destruction of Ketheric's army of Dark Justiciars, his Sharran army was defeated and Ketheric himself killed. Not long after his entombment in the Thorm Mausoleum, however, the lands surrounding Moonrise Towers were stricken with a [[Shadow-cursed lands|shadow curse]], plunging the region into malevolent shadow for over a century. The curse affected the armies of both sides and the locals without distinction, turning many into undead shadows that sought only to consume the living. Halsin's ''[[Druid Notebook]]'' mentions an acquaintance turning into a shadow that possessed a glaive. After the shadow was laid to rest, its glaive was brought to Emerald Grove and named [[Sorrow]] as a constant reminder of what was lost in the war."
