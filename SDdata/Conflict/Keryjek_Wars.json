In response, a number of them gathered together and formed a large raiding party. They crossed into Angulutiun territory and targeted the large caribou herds those tribes tended. This act started the war, which would result in fifty years of fighting between the two groups of Ulutiuns.\nThe final battle between the two tribes within the Ertyky Valley took place in in  and resulted in the loss of hundreds of warriors on each side.\nThe fighting finally ceased, a treaty was signed, and with this treaty was established the custom of koatulit, in which persons from the opposite tribes were invited to live as guests for an extended time period of feasting and games. Very little fighting has occurred between the two tribes in the thousands of years following.\nA memorial to the war and its final clash was built within Ertyky Valley in the form of an enormous equkoku (cemetery).\nCategoryWars\nCategoryEvents on the Great Glacier\nCategoryEvents in Northeast Faerûn\nCategoryEvents in Faerûn\nCategoryEvents on Toril\nge1jlz5xynlexvjna0au0mzsu7c4fik"
