        "mainbody": "he Rotting War was a civil war fought in Chondath from 900 DR to the , between the coastal and inland city-states of the nation.\nIn 901 DR, arch wizards of Arrabar and Reth joined the war, reigning devastation and death using ancient Netherese magics. In 902 DR, troops from Reth clashed in combat with the joint armies of Arrabar and Hlath in the Fields of Nun, in the foothills of the Akanapeaks. The rulers of Chondathan cities craved an easy win and ordered their wizards to summon deadly necromantic plagues. The resulting epidemic killed two-thirds of the Chondathan armies in minutes.\nMany of the battles were chronicled by three bards. Each warred with one of the three participating armies. At a later date, they became known as the Bards of Nun. Notably, each of the bards independently recorded the appearance of the Lord of Battles Tempus on the Fields of Nun before the faithful clash. The avatar rode on a skeletal steed, dripping blood on the battlefield. Each of the three armies generals took it as a good omen â€“ god of war on a white steed.\nThe members of the Chondathan army who survived took the plague home, spreading the deadly disease. Eventually entire counties and baronies were wiped out as a result of the mysterious plagues, especially in the area known as Chondalwood. This devastating outcome of the Rotting Wars ensured Arrabars loss of influence.\nThe nation of Chondath renounced its claims on Sembian cities and fractured, with all its cities having declared independence and returning to their old statuses as loosely allied city-states. This included the cities of Chancelgaunt, Chondathan, and Sespech. The only city not to declare independence was Iljak.\nCenturies later, it was speculated that a surviving sample of the Rotting Wars plagues may have been the cause of the Great Plague of 1317 DR."
