'''Bloodsword''' was the name given by the people of the city-state of [[Ormpur]], on the edge of [[Lapaliiya]] in [[southwest Faerûn]], to the day of [[Kythorn 12]] in the [[1306 DR|Year of Thunder, 1306 DR]]. On this day, a princess murdered her father, usurped the throne, burned a temple, and triggered a holy war.{{Cite dragon/272/The New Adventures of Volo: Quotations of the Realms|97}}

==Events==
On this day, Chansreena (princess) [[Maerildarraine]] murdered her own foster father, High Suikh (king) [[Askulder]], the Hand of Tiamat. She seized the throne and declared herself Queen of Ormpur, then led her loyal knights to plunder and burn the temple of [[Tiamat]], but the flames spread through the city. This outrageous act triggered a holy war, and by the end of the day, hundreds lay dead.

| text   = Rest you, good lady. Your labors have been hard this day, and the gods shall not soon forget what you accomplished. A war begun, a throne overthrown, a temple plundered, a city in flames, and hundreds dead. Hmmm… after this, I hope you don't find the morrow empty and boring.

At Torch Court at the end of this dark day, the jester [[Jeremmer Hardree]] alone dared quip to the still wounded and enraged Queen Maerildarraine, and kept his life.
