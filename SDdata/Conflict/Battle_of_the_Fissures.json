        "mainbody": "The '''Battle of the Fissures''' was the penultimate conflict between the tribes of the [[Bedine]] and the combined forces of the [[Zhentarim]] and their [[asabi]] mercenaries. While it was referred to as a \"battle\", it was little more than a massacre.\n\n{{Quote|Pass the word to dismount and come forward with lance and sword. We must pry these lizards from their dens.|[[Didaji]], to his fellow sheikhs before the battle.}}",
        "Description": "During daylight hours, while the nocturnal asabi rested, the united tribes of the Bedine systematically worked their way through the network of crevices and fissures in which the great lizards made their home. Using [[torch]]es, scrub brush that was lit on fire and even [[magic]]al, poisonous fumes, the Bedine smoked small groups of asabi out of their dens and shot them down with [[arrow]]s or pierced them with [[lance]]s. The battle continued from morning until dusk, when the Bedine warriors were exhausted and no more asabis remained.",
        "Location": "The attack occurred in a tunnel-complex in the southern peaks of the [[Wall of Fallen Djinn]] mountain range.",
        "Outcome": "{{Quote|It wasn't much of a battle. It was more like digging mice from their dens.|Sheikh Didaji.}}\nConsidering the asabi casualties outnumbered the Bedine by nearly ten-to-one, it was considered a victory for the gathered tribes, though one that did not bring them much glory.",
        "History": "The Battle of the Fissures took place during the series of conflicts that arose between the Bedine and the [[Zhentilar]] army during the {{yearlinkName|1360}}. It followed the [[Battle of the Chasm]] at the [[Well of the Chasm|oasis]] after which it was named; and preceded the siege of [[Orofin]], the decisive final battle between the two forces."
