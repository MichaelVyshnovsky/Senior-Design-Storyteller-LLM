The last '''battle with the Witch Lords''' took place in the {{YearlinkName|900}}, between the armies of [[Cormyr]] and the armies of the [[Witch Lords]] who had invaded. This was the final decisive battle of a war that had lasted several months. It took place about 40 miles from the edge of the [[Vast Swamp]] in Cormyr, at dawn.

==Participants==
===Witch Lords===
The Witchlords of Wyvernwater were [[necromancer]]s who had turned many of their [[human]] troops into [[zombie]]s before the battle. Their numbers included [[goblin]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[orc]]s, and [[troll]]s. Some higher-ranking humans entered the battle riding [[giant bat]]s. The wizard [[Luthax]] was among their number.

===Cormyreans===
The [[Glory of Cormyr]] was King [[Galaghard III]]'s army, which consisted of human foot troops and cavalry, including armies from [[Marsember]] and [[Arabel]]. It was supported by the High Wizard of Cormyr, [[Thanderahast]], and the King's cousin, [[Aosinin Truesilver]].

=== Elves===
The elf army was led by [[Othorion Keove]] and, although not large in number, was well armed and armored throughout. The army contained airborne units and those mounted on [[stag]]s.

==Battle==
As the battle began, the Witch Lords unleashed bat-mounted units who used lightning-based attacks to pick off some of the Marsembian troops. Thanderahast had spotted his old enemy Luthax in the air and used magic to engage him. The fight was swinging towards the Witch Lords and a large troll was bearing down on Galaghard when a young [[Bleth]] sacrificed himself to give the king more time to react. At this point, the orcs and goblins were driving the humans back on one flank in a move to encircle them.

The elves entered the battle and broke the orc and goblin advance, slaying their ogre leaders and routing them. This was the turn of the battle and the zombies were quickly defeated by the elves and the surviving humans, now inspired to continue the fight. The rest of the Witch Lords' army quickly retreated into the swamp, and the battle was won by the elves and the humans.
