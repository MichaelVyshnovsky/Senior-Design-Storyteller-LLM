        "mainbody": "The final battle of the war occurred in −166 in which the allied forces were victorious. The battle took place in a [[Eyesvale|tiny glen]] between [[Ithal Pass]] and Kzelter. There, standing atop [[Uller's Hill]] at the southern end of the field, King Silvam slew the last of the beholders.\n\nThe hill was \"lopsided\" because of how many petrified beholder corpses and [[humanoid]] skeletons were buried adjacent to the original hill.\n\n===Aftermath===\nWhile the war ultimately ended in victory for the humans and dwarves, it was at great cost. The fallen Calishite cities were retaken, and Calimshan began the process of rebuilding them after all the destruction. The alliance remained intact for a few years to continue pursuing renegade beholders scattered about their lands.\n\nWithin five years, however, the nations only remained allies in trade. Many among the [[Tethyrian]] clans did not believe the war had been of any benefit to Tethyr; they had sacrificed greatly with little thanks from the two other countries involved.\n\nIt was not until the {{YearlinkName|-150}} that the then [[syl-pasha]] of Calimport, [[Kamus el Tarshaj]], ceded the lands of [[Monrativi Teshy Mir]]—what would later become [[Ankaram]]—to Tethyr. In truth, this was more to protect Syl-Pasha el Tarshaj. Rumors had reached the syl-pasha that some of the clans of Tethyr were talking of beginning a war to take more land from Calimshan while it was weak. He had also heard rumors that other Calishite nobles in that area were also seeking to overturn his rule. King Silvam Ithal was named raj of Ankaram, removing the former raj of Mir from power and effectively ending both threats to the syl-pasha's rule simultaneously.\n\nIn Iltkazar, the dwarves found themselves severely weakened by the war, and this led to the loss of territory against other evils—drow from [[Guallidurth]], [[mind flayer]]s from [[Oryndoll]], and clans of [[duergar]].",
        "Location": "The battles were fought north of the [[Forest of Mir]] in Iltkazar, in eastern Calimshan, and around the city-states of the [[Lake of Steam]].",
        "History": {
            "Causes": "The beholders of the Alimir Mountains first arrived some two millennia prior in the year {{Yearlink|-2381}}, when three of their colony ships—[[spelljammer]]s from another world—crash-landed in the mountains. For the next two thousand years, the beholders and the [[Calishite]]s had conflicts with each other. In fact, all of the members of the so-called [[Alimir Hive]] were descendants of a single [[hive mother]] from one of those three crashed spelljammers.\n\nBattles with the beholders of the Alimir Hive continued in the [[Third Age of Calimshan]], and there was even a short period from {{Yearlink|-1428}} to {{Yearlink|-1402}} where beholders ruled all of Calimshan, until they were removed from power by [[warrior]]-[[priest]]s of various [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian powers]] known as the [[Drakhon]]s. However, while the Drakhons took back Calimshan proper, the beholders instead turned their attention to the [[Arnaden region]] and the Lake of Steam.\n\nWar with the beholders erupted again from {{Yearlink|-1280}} to {{Yearlink|-1080}}. Calishite forces, having developed the technologies of [[shortbow]]s and [[chariot]]s, were able to reduce the population of Alimir beholders to half of what it was and clear the region around [[Almraiven]] of the monsters.\n\nHowever, by the time of the [[Empire Plague]] to {{Yearlink|-370}}, Calimshan had fully lost control over the Arnaden region farther east to the tyrants again, and by −170 DR, a number of trusted [[Alzhedo dictionary#N|''nazirs'']] had even revealed themselves to be secret members of beholder cults, sworn to obedience to the Alimir Hive. The [[Arnaden|Arnadar]] and the [[eye tyrant]]s now set their many eyes on areas such as the [[Omlarandin Mountains]], the [[Kuldin Peaks]], and the Forest of Mir as places where they could entrench themselves for future incursions into civilized lands. In this year, they advanced with their troops north of the Forest of Mir into the dwarven kingdom of Iltkazar and west deeper into Calishite lands. The city of Almraiven fell before the month of [[Tarsakh]] and [[Suldolphor]] fell before [[Greengrass]].\n\nIn the dwarf-built city of [[Iltakar]], (later the city of [[Shoonach]]), the [[Garrison Meetings]] were held, in which King [[Silvam Ithal]] of Tethyr served as an intermediary between Calimshan and Iltkazar, which, like Tethyr, had previously been under Calishite control. The meetings were a success, and the three loosely allied nations joined forces in battle against the eye tyrants. For its part, Calimshan agreed to the alliance primarily out of dire need. Additionally, it hoped to find a weakness in Tethyr's army that would allow it to retake its former \"rebellious\" territories at a later date. \n\n[[File:Shield of Silvam.png|thumb|right|250px|''King Silvam Ithal of Tethyr bearing the legendary ''Shield of Silvam''.'']]\nBefore leaving with his troops for war, King Silvam's vizera, [[Zahyra Ithal]], gifted him with a powerful magic [[artifact]] that she and her mentor had created, the ''[[Shield of Silvam]]''. Besides the power to reflect the eyebeams of beholders, the shield allowed Vizera Zahyra to observe and participate in the battle with her [[crystal ball]] known as the ''[[Eye of Zahyra]]''. Not only could she monitor the status of the king and his troops, she could support them with her own spells and with the healing spells of [[cleric]]s in the court, who all remained safely back in Tethyr.{{Cite web/The Candlekeep Collection}})",
            "Battles": "The Calishite generals proposed many strategies designed for the Tethyrian and Iltkazaran armies to take the most casualties, and the beholders took advantage of these dis-unified battle plans to earn the majority of the early victories in the war. Early in the first year of conflict, before the month of [[Kythorn]], the beholders had conquered nearly all of southern Itlkazar and half of Calimshan, pushing west past Almraiven into the [[Spider Swamp]] and the Forest of Mir. The cities of Almraiven and Suldolphor, as already noted, had fallen to the beholder onslaught, as did the southern half of the Forest of Mir. This positioning by the beholder forces effectively cut off western reinforcements from reaching the eastern parts of Calimshan from the west.",
            "Aftermath": "While the war ultimately ended in victory for the humans and dwarves, it was at great cost. The fallen Calishite cities were retaken, and Calimshan began the process of rebuilding them after all the destruction. The alliance remained intact for a few years to continue pursuing renegade beholders scattered about their lands.\n\nWithin five years, however, the nations only remained allies in trade.

        "Combatants": {
            "Casualties": "Tethyr lost half of its troops to the war. Clan Bormul was hit particularly hard, loosing half of its noble sons, including the famous [[paladin]] [[Alonso Bormul]], who was Lord Pyrus's younger brother."
        },
        "Rumors & Legends": "Some believed that Lord Pyrus had caused the death of his younger brother by leading him into an ambush, being jealous of the latter for his many acts of valor. Such rumors were never proven.\n\nIn the city of Volothamp, one probably untrue legend told of the beholder [[Wythal|Wythal the Vile]] who ruled the city during its occupation during the war. Wythal was said to enjoy [[Flesh to stone|petrifying]] and then shattering anyone who opposed him. However, he kept as statues the victims whom he had managed to capture in \"humorous poses\". One of his statues, a former [[Alzhedo dictionary#A|''askar'']], came to life one night, though his body remained in the form of stone. The lowly soldier ended the dreadful reign of Wythal by shoving one stone hand and a stone arm stump into Wythal's central eye and then ripping the beholder wide open. Upon killing the monster, the ''askar'' of stone then crumbled to dust with a deafening cry of joy that echoed throughout the entire city.\n\nThe Eye Tyrant Wars were one of the major conflicts thought to have been cryptically predicted by the famed [[Abbalaya]]r seer [[Nar'ysr|el Nar'ysr]] in his [[Eclipse Prophecies]]."
