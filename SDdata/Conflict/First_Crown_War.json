        "mainbody": "The '''First Crown War''' was a conflict fought between the [[elf|elven]] realms of [[Aryvandaar]] and [[Miyeritar]] in [[northwest Faerûn]] in the 12{{th}} millennium before [[Dalereckoning]]. It was considered part of the overall [[Crown Wars]] and was largely concurrent with the [[Second Crown War]] also fought by Aryvandaar.",
        "History": "Following hundreds of years of futile diplomacy, greedy and impatient rulers of Aryvandaar, led by the [[Vyshaan]] clan attacked Miyeritar in {{YearlinkName|-12000}}, commencing the First Crown War. The Aryvandaarans started pressuring [[Shantel Othreier]] to join with them or suffer Miyeritar's fate.\n\nIn {{YearlinkName|-11800}}, Aryvandaar annexed and occupied Miyeritar but had to deal with resistance from clans and strongholds that still held out. Elves of [[Illefarn]], though officially neutral, secretly provided safe havens for elves fleeing Miyeritar.\n\nThe ongoing Crown Wars, and the [[Sable Wars]], caused a dramatic influx of elf refugees moving onto and into the [[Inner Sea]], away from the coasts, around {{YearlinkName|-11400}}. Their migration triggered the first significant conflicts with [[merfolk]] and [[sahuagin]].\n\nFinally, in {{YearlinkName|-11300}}, Aryvandaar fully conquered Miyeritar, ending the First Crown War."
