        "mainbody": "The War of the Twins, (or the War of the Harts,) was a war of succession that took place in the kingdom of Hartsvale in the late 14 century DR.\nWhen King Blod of the line of Hartkiller died, he left behind two twin princes, Camden and Dunstan. Since each had equal right to the throne, they began a long and deadly war against each other.\nThe War of the Twins lasted for three years.\nCamden and Gobokas strategy was to use a small band of ogres to pull out Dunstans forces from their defensible position so that a larger allied force of humans and ogres could attack. The plan was successful, and Dunstan was defeated.\nWhile Camden won the war and became king, he alienated many of his subjects in the process. Moreover, his wife soon gave birth to a daughter, Brianna."
