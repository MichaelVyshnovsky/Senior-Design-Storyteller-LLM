        "mainbody": "The Battle of Lendons Dike was a battle in the Moonsea region between the defenders of Hulburg and their mercenaries against the Warlock Knights and their orc and hobgoblin allies.\nIn Ches of 1479 DR, Kardhel Terov of the Warlock Knights approached warchief Mhurren of the Bloody Skulls orc tribe. He offered the warchief complete control over Thar and its various tribes in return for an oath of fealty. After sacking Glister with the promised troops and armaments, the army marched on Hulburg with a force now consisting of the orcs of the Bloody Skulls and Burning Daggers, the ogres of the Skullsmashers, the hobgoblins of the Red Claws, and a contingent of Warlock Knights and their controlled beasts, including wyverns and manticores.\nThey were met northwest of the town by an army half their size, led by Kara Hulmaster, known to the orcs as the Blue Serpent and a fearsome warrior. Karas army—which consisted of the towns Shieldsworn, mercenaries hired by Hulburgs merchant companies, and the professional mercenary company known as the Icehammers—was defeated, and the survivors retreated to Lendons Dike, the last defensible position between them and the town.\nThere, they were met by Geran Hulmaster and Hulburgs mostly untrained militia. When the orcs caught up, they held their own for several minutes until an army of undead appeared, summoned by Sergen Hulmaster to murder his family. Geran stopped him by stealing the magical amulet—a gift from Aesperus for Sergen returning his lost spellbook—that Sergen was using to control the undead. He then turned them on the orcs.\nWhen the sun rose, the amulet crumbled and the undead disappeared, giving the orcs the opportunity to once again attack the Hulburgans. At this point, the forces of House Veruna fled the field, and if not for Mhurrens death at the hands of Kara, it is likely the tribes would have overrun the defenders. Instead, the orcs and their allies retreated.\nTheir defeat severely weakened the Bloody Skulls tribe and created a power vacuum among the monstrous tribes of Thar. This led to fighting between dozens of tribes of orcs, goblinoids, and giantkin as they rushed to assert dominance.\nBecause of their actions during the battle, House Veruna was banned from the city of Hulburg."
