        "Equipment": "The leaders of the uprising used heavy [[Crossbow|crossbows]] that bore the same name as the event. [[Glorious Revolution (crossbow)|These crossbows]] possessed a ''+2'' [[Item enchantment|enchantment]] that made the [[weapon]] deadlier and guided the wielder's hand toward the target. It was especially effective at hitting [[evil]] targets. Its [[Magic|magics]] also increased the wielder's [[spell]] resistance."
