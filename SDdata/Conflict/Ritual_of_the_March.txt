The Ritual of the March was an ancient ritual used by the dwarves of Delzoun to traverse great distances as a unified army. The March included all of the various dwarven clans united as one with the common goal to defeat their enemies.
During the March, the dwarves would sing the ancient marching songs of old Delzoun while tirelessly marching and fighting their enemies for hundreds of miles. The magics and enchantments that were imbued in the dwarves during this period were ingrained into the very core of their being.
During the War of the Silver Marches in the , the resurrected King Bruenor Battlehammer channeled the whispers of Dumathoin through the memories of the Throne of the Dwarf Gods (located in the ancient dwarven stronghold of Gauntlgrym) to evoke the unity of the clans and the remembrance of the March. In doing so, the dwarves were able to wage a successful continuous marching campaign in the summer against the forces of Hartusk, the orc warlord of Many-Arrows. They retook the lands around Keepers Dale and defeated the orc armies surrounding Citadel Felbarr and the Cold Vale to Dark Arrow Keep. The March comprised 9,000 magically enhanced stomping, singing, battleclad warriors and dwarf priests. It was led by four dwarf kings and supported by three hundred Moonwood elf archers.
