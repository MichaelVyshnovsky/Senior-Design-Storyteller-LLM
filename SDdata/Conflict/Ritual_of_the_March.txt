The '''Ritual of the March''' was an ancient ritual used by the [[dwarves]] of [[Delzoun]] to traverse great distances as a unified army. The March included all of the various dwarven clans united as one with the common goal to defeat their enemies.

==Process==
During the March, the dwarves would sing the ancient marching songs of old Delzoun while tirelessly marching and fighting their enemies for hundreds of miles. The [[magic]]s and enchantments that were imbued in the dwarves during this period were ingrained into the very core of their being.

==History==
During the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the resurrected King [[Bruenor Battlehammer]] channeled the whispers of [[Dumathoin]] through the memories of the [[Throne of the Dwarf Gods]] (located in the ancient dwarven stronghold of [[Gauntlgrym]]) to evoke the unity of the clans and the remembrance of the March. In doing so, the dwarves were able to wage a successful continuous marching campaign in the summer against the forces of [[Hartusk]], the [[orc]] warlord of [[Many-Arrows]]. They retook the lands around [[Keeper's Dale]] and defeated the orc armies surrounding [[Citadel Felbarr]] and the [[Cold Vale]] to [[Dark Arrow Keep]]. The March comprised 9,000 magically enhanced stomping, singing, battleclad warriors and dwarf priests. It was led by four dwarf kings and supported by three hundred [[Moonwood]] [[elf]] archers.
