        "History": "After a decisive victory at the [[battle of Arambar Gulch]], the rebel dragonborn leaders [[Iskdara]] and [[Shurideh]] had gained a powerful [[artifact]] known as the [[Eye of Blazing Rorn]], after felling its previous owner, the [[silver dragon]] [[Asativarainuth]]. The two dragonborn sisters joined forces with the leaders of other rebel war bands, in order to kill the most powerful of the [[dragon]] tyrants of [[Abeir]], the [[red dragon]] [[Rhodrolytharnestrix]].\n\nThey went to the [[Crippled Mountain|Celestial Mountain]], a dormant volcano where Rhodrolytharnestrix had his lair, and opened a tunnel to the lava chambers using the [[Breath of Petron]]. While the rest of the dragonborn leaders led their war bands against Rhodrolytharnestrix's dragon army, Iskara, Shurideh, [[Reshvemi]], and [[Thuchir]] infiltrated the mountain and dropped the Eye of Blazing Rorn into the volcano, triggering an eruption so powerful that it killed Rhodrolytharnestrix, even though he was a red dragon.",
        "Aftermath": "The Celestial Mountain was destroyed, and was called the [[Crippled Mountain]] since then. The dragonborn heroes survived the explosion and reunited with the other rebel leaders, creating the dragonborn nation of [[Tymanchebar]]. The ash from the eruption fell for forty days, and the dragonborn began to call themselves the \"''vayemniri''\" (Ash-Marked Ones, in [[Draconic language|draconic]]), so that they would always remember the way they gained their freedom.\n\nAlthough she tried her best, sending wave after wave of dragons to attack the dragonborn lands, the Empress Dragon [[Gauwervyndhal]] was unable to conquer Tymanchebar. This remained unchanged until the [[Blue Breath of Change]] transported [[Laerakond]] to the world of [[Toril]]."
