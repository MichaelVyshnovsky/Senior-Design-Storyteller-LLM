            "The Beginnings": "In the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Szass Tam caused the murders of the zulkirs [[Druxus Rhym]] and [[Aznar Thrul]] and betrayed a Thayan army under the command of tharchions [[Azhir Kren]] and [[Homen Odesseiron]] to the [[Rashemen|Rashemi]] to create a climate of fear within the Thayan population. He further hindered proper investigation of the murders to solve these issues by himself. Szass thus tried to convince the nobles, legions and common people that he was the only one able to deal with these problems, in order to get himself elected supreme ruler of Thay.\n\nHis former ally Dmitra Flass discerned Szass Tam's plan and rallied the zulkirs originally loyal to the lich to stand against his aspirations.  Szass then chose to achieve rulership by force and declared war on all opposing zulkirs."
