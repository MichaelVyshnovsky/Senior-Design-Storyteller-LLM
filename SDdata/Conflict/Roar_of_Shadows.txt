The Roar of Shadows was a titanic conflict between the avatars of Nobanion, the King of Lions, and Malar, the Beastlord, during the Time of Troubles.
This battle occurred within the Gulthmere Forest of the Vilhon Reach.
When gods were forced to walk on Toril, in the , the avatar of Malar invaded the Gulthmere Forestâ€”the territory guarded by the Lion God, the avatar of Nobanion. Malars plan of slaughtering druids of the forest was foiled by the lion deity, and the two clashed in a rancorous battle named the Roar of Shadows. The battle was joined by ranking members of the Emerald Enclave, aiding Nobanion, and in the end, Malar was pushed out of the forest and driven north.
Nobanion secured the forest as the seat of his power on Toril, eventually opening a permanent portal to the Beastlands.
