        "mainbody": "The '''Orcgate Wars''', which began in {{Yearlink|-1076}}, were originally a magical experiment that quickly escalated into a war of devastating proportions across the [[Old Empires]].",
        "History": "In {{Yearlink|-1081}}, the theurgist adept [[Thayd]], last apprentice of the [[Imaskari]] [[wizard]]s, opened a fateful portal to a brutal world dominated by empires of fanatically religious [[orc]]s. After inciting the wizards of [[Mulhorand]] and [[Unther]] into rebellion, he was executed, leaving no one in [[Faerûn]] with knowledge of the existence of the portal. For five years, the portal remained dormant until the orcs began pouring through, eventually laying siege to both Mulhorand and Unther for six years.\n\nMore fanatical than those of the [[North Faerûn|north]], these invading [[gray orc]]s and their [[cleric]]s had developed amazingly powerful and deadly [[spell]]s; the most potent of [[magic]]s being their ability to directly call down [[avatar]]s of their [[deity|deities]]. Avatars of the gods of Mulhorand and Unther also dwelt on Faerûn, but weakened after the oppression under the Imaskari empire, were ill-prepared to defend against the orc hordes. \n\nThe orc invasion began in {{Yearlink|-1076}} in the lands that later would become [[Thay]], forcing the Mulhorandi to recruit mercenaries to help them quench the orc hordes, among them the warriors of the tribes of [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nar]], [[Rashemi]] and [[Sossrim]]. The war took a decisive turning point in the [[Battle of the Gods]], when most of the gods of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon|Mulhorandi]] and [[Untheric pantheon]]s were killed. One of the gods who perished in the war was [[Re]]. However, his death was not in vain. With his dying breath, he created hundreds of powerful [[enchanted]] [[greataxe]]s imbued with magics what made them extremely deadly to orcs. These weapons became known as ''[[Re's Redemption]]'' and helped to turn the tides of war.\n\nDespite their initial victories, the orc armies and their deities were heavily weakened, eventually being routed by the remnants of the Mulhorandi and Untheric pantheons after a rally in {{Yearlink|-1069}}.",
        "Aftermath": "So complete was the destruction of the orc horde that the gray orcs in the region were never able to fully recover from their losses.\n\nAfter returning to their homelands, the surviving mercenaries founded a series of kingdoms that eventually gave rise to the nations of [[Damara]], [[Narfell]], [[Rashemaar]] and [[Raumathar]]."
