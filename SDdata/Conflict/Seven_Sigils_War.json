        "mainbody": "he Seven Sigils War was a conflict between the wizards of Netheril against extraplanar immortals that theyd accidentally allowed to access Toril.\nThe conflict began in the  at the Netherese domain of Rdiuz, which was located along the Gods Legion Mountains (later known as the Desertsmouth Mountains). The Netherese had built a mighty floating citadel they named Meigg and were preparing to send troops into the Outer Planes through a massive portal called Cats Gate, seeking to conquer communities in the Outlands.\nThe portal turned out to be insecure, and allowed powerful extraplanar immortals from the Outer Planes to enter Toril, with initially devastating results for the Netherese.\nDesperately seeking ways to quickly regain the upper hand, the Netherese wizards set upon the idea of using the natural enemies of the immortals, the elementals. Knowing that the Anchor of Chaos in the Monument of the Ancients was actively preventing the Elemental Chaos from boiling into Toril through a dimensional weakness, they went there to deliberately sabotage the Anchor, which allowed a primordial to enter Toril for the first time in long ages.\nIn the , after over a century of bitter conflict, the Netherese managed to banish most all of the extraplanar entities that they had accidentally and deliberately summoned into Toril. Notably, one primordial, Maram of the Great Spear, escaped their attentions and fled into the wilderness."
