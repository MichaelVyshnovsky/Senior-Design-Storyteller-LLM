        "mainbody": "The '''Seven Sigils War''' was a conflict between the wizards of [[Netheril]] against extraplanar [[immortal]]s that they'd accidentally allowed to access [[Toril]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|48}}",
        "Location": "The conflict began in the {{YearlinkName|-489}} at the [[Netherese]] domain of [[Rdiuz]], which was located along the Gods' Legion Mountains (later known as the [[Desertsmouth Mountains]]). The Netherese had built a mighty floating citadel they named [[Meigg]] and were preparing to send troops into the [[Outer Planes]] through a massive portal called ''[[Cat's Gate]]'', seeking to conquer communities in [[the Outlands]].",
        "History": {
            "Causes": "The portal turned out to be insecure, and allowed powerful extraplanar immortals from the Outer Planes to enter [[Toril]], with initially devastating results for the Netherese.",
            "Battle": "Desperately seeking ways to quickly regain the upper hand, the Netherese wizards set upon the idea of using the natural enemies of the immortals, the [[elemental]]s. Knowing that the [[Anchor of Chaos]] in the [[Monument of the Ancients]] was actively preventing the [[Elemental Chaos]] from boiling into Toril through a dimensional weakness, they went there to deliberately sabotage the Anchor, which allowed a [[primordial]] to enter Toril for the first time in long ages.",
            "Aftermath": "In the {{YearlinkName|-371}}, after over a century of bitter conflict, the Netherese managed to banish most all of the extraplanar entities that they had accidentally and deliberately summoned into Toril. Notably, one primordial, [[Maram of the Great Spear]], escaped their attentions and fled into the wilderness."
