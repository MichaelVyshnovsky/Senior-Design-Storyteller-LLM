The '''Battle for Eveningstar''' was a pivotal battle of the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] that determined the course of the war from that point on. It was fought between the forces of [[Sschindylryn]] and the defenders of [[Cormyr]] as the [[drow]] attempted to capture the village of [[Eveningstar]] and the [[Thread of the Weave]] that [[Lolth]] sought.

The day preceding the battle, Swordcaptain [[Garwyn Thane]] received scout's reports indicating an imminent attack on the village, and likely that same night. He deduced that while they could feasibly attack in the daytime under the [[Darkening]], it would be too obvious and give away their attack, and so they would simply strike under cover of darkness to ensure their advantage. The villagers prepared the barricades and bonfires as best they could, and grimly waited for the drow attack once night fell. The defenders were made up by [[Purple Dragons]], [[War Wizards]], Evenor militia, [[adventurer]]s (including those from [[Eberron]]), and [[Elminster]]'s protégé [[Ana Brabener]]. On the drow side, their soldiers were supported by [[drider]]s, [[priest]]s of Lolth, and [[necromancer]]s with their [[zombie]]s. They also sent many captured Cormyreans forward with their ''[[drow slave collar]]s'' to fight and die against their own people.

Rather than taking to the field as a fighter, Elminster used his own fame and prominence against the drow attackers. He conspicuously left the village before the battle started, and led a sizable contingent of drow soldiers on a chase across the countryside. They believed that the Old Sage must be focused on protecting the Thread of the Weave, and so judged that pursuing him was just as vital as taking Eveningstar itself. Ana Brabener was left behind in the comparatively safe role of using her magical abilities to support the defenders at the village.

The initial attack broke through the palisade gates, but were easily defeated by the awaiting defenders. Before the drow could regroup, the adventurers charged out into the ruined western edge of the village, which had been abandoned ever since the first attack. They fought in the streets below the razed [[House of Morning]], cleared the village granary, and recaptured [[Tummarlin's farmstead]] on the edge of the forest. They also lit more bonfires as they took ground to dissuade drow counterattacks in their bright firelight. Along the way they encountered the cruel [[necromancer]] [[Jevan]] of [[House Szind]] and his horde of [[drow]] and [[human]] [[zombie]]s, the slaver [[Kal'anoth]] of [[House Avithoul]] and his collection of unwilling [[slave]] soldiers, and the [[priestess]] of [[Lolth]] [[Xyra Dun'Robar]] who ritually sacrificed others to preserve her own vitality.

With the ruins of Eveningstar cleared of invaders, the Cormyreans pursued the drow to their base camp in the nearby [[King's Forest]], where they had emerged from a cave entrance. There they found the field commander [[Draya Dun'Robar]], who rode atop the huge [[bebilith]] [[Red Weaver]]. After a fierce battle with the commander, a horde of [[spider]]s, and more drow soldiers, Red Weaver and Draya were slain, putting an end to the battle and breaking the siege of the village. Though the drow continued to skirmish and raid in the area, they failed to reassemble a large, organized force and the Cormyreans were able to take the initiative in the rest of the war. They used this advantage to strike directly at the Houses in Sschindylryn, ultimately weakening them and breaking their alliance.
