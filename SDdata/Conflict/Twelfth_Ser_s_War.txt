The '''Twelfth Serôs War''' was the major event in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] of the 1,439{{th}} year of [[Timesong]] ([[1369 DR]]). It involved the destruction brought by [[Iakhovas]] the Ravager, a great shark.

==History==
The war officially began on [[Flamerule 18|Eldasong 21]] when Iakhovas and his [[sahuagin]] demolished a large portion of the [[Sharksbane Wall]] and destroyed [[Akhanmyr]].

Iakhovas soon allied with the [[morkoth]] of [[Olleth]], the [[merfolk]] of [[Thurindru]], and the [[koalinth]] of the [[Sea Hulks]] tribe. They attacked the [[Xedran Reefs]].

Sahuagin caused the death of over 1,000 unhatched shalarin in Es'rath, which enraged all the shalarin of [[As'arem]] and brought them into the war as well.

Iakhovas next used magic to turn the entire population of the [[Whamite Isles]] into zombies to fight for him. [[Avina]], [[Lacuan]], and [[Voalidru]] soon fell. In revenge, [[ixitxachitl]]s from the Xedran Reefs annihilated three-quarters of the koalinth army.

The allied good races, known as the [[Nantarn Alliance]] rallied at [[Xadea]] and [[Myth Nantar]]. The merfolk of Xadea lost great numbers in an attempt to draw Iakhovas and his army toward Myth Nantar for a planned trap. His army began to break apart and was pressed against the forces of Myth Nantar.

The war ended on [[Uktar 11|Roamsong 23]] of {{YearlinkConvert|1439|TS}} when the High Mages of Myth Nantar created a ''[[whirlpool gate]]'' that cast Iakhovas into the [[Outer Sea]]. Many ships on the surface were destroyed and two of the High Mages were also lost.
