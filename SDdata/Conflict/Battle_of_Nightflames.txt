The '''Battle of Nightflames''' occurred in [[1334 DR]] between the armies of [[Mulsparkh]] and [[Tethyr]]. The Tethyrian forces were led by Crown Prince [[Rythan]] who was killed in the battle. The armies of [[Calimshan]] destroyed Mulsparkh itself soon after the battle.{{Cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|67}} Mulsparkh had been created by the [[Twisted Rune]] as part of their plot to exact revenge upon Rythan for his murdering [[Jhaniloth Puiral]] a few years earlier in [[1330 DR]].
