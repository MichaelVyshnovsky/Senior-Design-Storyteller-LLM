The Battle of Nightflames occurred in 1334 DR between the armies of Mulsparkh and Tethyr. The Tethyrian forces were led by Crown Prince Rythan who was killed in the battle. The armies of Calimshan destroyed Mulsparkh itself soon after the battle. Mulsparkh had been created by the Twisted Rune as part of their plot to exact revenge upon Rythan for his murdering Jhaniloth Puiral a few years earlier in 1330 DR.
