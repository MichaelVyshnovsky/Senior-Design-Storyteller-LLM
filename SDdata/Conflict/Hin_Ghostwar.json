In , the stronghearts and lightfoots allied against the ghostwise and battle continued for years until Chand of the stronghearts slew Desva in .\nMost of the few surviving ghostwise left Luiren for the Chondalwood, making an oath that they wouldnt speak until they had atoned for their savagery. They organized into familiar clans and became more isolated.\nMany lightfoots, horrified by the war, chose to leave Luiren and spread across northern Faer没n and mixing with other races.\nThe stronghearts remained in the Lluirwood and began building permanent settlements.\nCategoryWars\nCategoryEvents in the Lluirwood\nCategoryEvents in Luiren\nCategoryEvents in the Shining South\nCategoryEvents in Southeast Faer没n\nCategoryEvents in Faer没n\nCategoryEvents on Toril\nkebqebdknu14v5a5ac315ka327xhvax"
