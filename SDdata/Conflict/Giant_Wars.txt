The '''Giant Wars''' were fought between the [[giant]]s of [[Nedeheim]] and the [[dwarves]] of [[High Shanatar]] from {{Yearlink|-5360}} to {{Yearlink|-5350}}.

The dwarves were led by [[Karlyn]] of [[House Kuldever]].

By the end of the war, more than five thousand giants of Nedeheim had fallen to the dwarves and half of the entire giant population south of the [[Cloud Peaks]] was exterminated. The giant realm of Nedeheim was reduced to scattered clanholds.
