It ended in victory for the Netherese, who broke the Zhentarims power in the Moonsea region and caused a schism between the Zhentarim and the Church of Bane.The name of the Shadowbane War and its date of 1383 DR are given in Dungeon magazine Issue #170 Monument of the Ancients, in which the only additional information provided is that Cvaal Daoran killed a shade prince. It is not explicitly stated to be the same as the broader conflict between Netheril and the Zhentarim mentioned in other sources, and canon material does not explicitly name or date the conflict elsewhere. However, the author of Monument of the Ancients, Brian R. James, clarified in a [https//web.archive.org/web/20230420160236/https//twitter.com/brianrjames/status/1696164904?s=46&t=xaFHtQctnID1KcLCd6DOzg Tweet] that the broader conflict indeed occurred in 1383 DR. Thus, the Shadowbane War is presumed to be the name for the broader conflict.\nThe war took place across the western Moonsea, where the Zhentarim had built their influence.\nShortly following the Return of the Nertherese city of Thultanthar to Toril in the , the shadovar began a campaign to exterminate their ancient enemies, the phaerimm. By 1383 DR, they had determined that Fzoul Chembryl, the leader of the Zhentarim, had secretly formed an alliance with the phaerimm, and so decided to move against him and the Moonsea cities under Zhentarim control.\nThe Netherese razed both Zhentil Keep and the Citadel of the Raven, the two biggest centers of Zhentarim power in the Moonsea, The siege of Zhentil Keep left Fzoul Chembryl dead, Meanwhile, the Zhents fought back viciously, \nFollowing their defeats, the Zhentarim went from controlling half of the Moonsea to having no meaningful foothold in the region, and they ceased to be a threat to the surrounding areas&mdashsuch as the Dalelands&mdashas they had once been. They retreated to their strongholds at Darkhold and Stormwatch. \nWith most of their leaders dead or missing, the Zhentarim fractured, and soon many of its cells across Faer√ªn disbanded or were destroyed by rival factions. The death of Fzoul had particularly profound consequences as it led to a schism within the Zhentarim. Followers of Bane were forced out by followers of Cyric, who would go on to attempt to exert control over the Black Network (although they would prove to be less successful than the Banites had been under Fzoul).\nThe victorious Netherese attempted to claim the cities of the Moonsea as colonies, however they were stymied when Coronal Ilsevele of Myth Drannor allied with the cities of Hillsfar, Melvaunt, and Thentia to oppose them. Over the next century, Netheril and Myth Drannor would vie for influence over the Moonsea region.\nThe pact formed between Phlan and the fey of the Quivering Forest continued to be enforced by the fey for decades. When Talaric Daoran&mdashCvaals descendant&mdashviolated the agreement in the , this lead to his disappearance."
