        "mainbody": "The '''Goblin Wars''' were a series of conflicts fought in [[the North]] between the [[goblin]]s of the [[Valley of Khedrun]], the [[Uthgardt Alliance]], and the [[Covenant]] in [[753 DR]].",
        "History": {
            "Causes": "In the {{YearlinkName|705}}, the [[mage]]s of the [[Covenant]] began to covertly and magically manipulate the various [[Uthgardt]] tribes. By the end of the season, all the tribes stood united and ready to battle the [[goblinoid]]s of the [[Savage Frontier]], in what would be known as the Uthgardt Alliance.\n\nThese Uthgardt were tasked, in the {{YearlinkName|715}}, with hunting down and killing as many [[orc]] chieftains as possible. Twenty were eliminated over the next five years, preventing the formation of a horde.",
            "War": "Then, in the {{YearlinkName|753}}, a horde of goblins burst out of the Valley of Khedrun in the [[Spine of the World]] mountains and marched southward. They quickly overcame the defenders of [[Mirabar]] and looted the city.{{ Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|22}}\n\nSeveral of the Uthgardt tribes fought the goblins fiercely and relentlessly, facing them day and night for almost all season. Their efforts reduced the goblins' numbers significantly.\n\nFinally, the Covenant led the people of the [[Dessarin Valley]] against the goblins and wiped them out.",
            "Aftermath": "Following the battle, goblins were rendered nearly extinct in the North. However, Nethaug, with ''Namarra'' in hand, and others escaped back into the Spine of the World, into a ravine so remote that they would hold it securely well into the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nAfter the Goblin Wars, the Uthgardt Alliance battled another army of goblins and orcs led by [[ogre]]s that marched out of the [[Evermoors]] in the {{YearlinkName|775}}. The loss of the Uthgardt warriors and the suffering of the tribes, with the [[Elk tribe]] almost going extinct, led to the dissolution of the Alliance by {{Yearlink|802}}."
