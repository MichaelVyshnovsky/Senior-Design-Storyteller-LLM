        "mainbody": "The '''Dragonfall War''' was a conflict between the [[dragon|draconic]] followers of [[Bahamut]] and [[Tiamat]], part of the larger civil wars known as the [[Draco Holy Wars]]. In some respects the conflict never ended.",
        "History": "The war began in the [[Dawn Age|Time of Dragons]], circa {{Yearlink|-30000}}, In retribution, Tiamat unleashed all sorts of dragon-like beings during the war, breeding warped creatures from her eggs. These aberrant entities became known as the [[dragonspawn|Spawn of Tiamat]]. To counter them, Bahamut created his own agents, the [[dragonborn of Bahamut|dragonborn]], to act as his soldiers and knights.\n\nThe most recent era of conflict occurred between {{Yearlink|-2087}} and {{Yearlink|-1071}} in [[Unther]]. Upon the arrival of Tiamat's cult in Unther, priests of [[Enlil]] began to claim that she was the \"Nemesis of the Gods\" and the god-kings claimed that she was responsible for Untherian setbacks. Bahamut became part of the [[Untheric pantheon]] under the alias of [[Marduk]] to oppose her. This conflict concluded with the death of both Tiamat and Marduk during the [[Battle of the Gods]] in −1071 DR.\n\nAfter the last [[Rage of Dragons]] of {{Yearlink|1373}}, the dragon population of [[Faerûn]] regained their interest in worshiping the [[Draconic pantheon]]. This made the followers of Bahamut and Tiamat to began preparations for a possible future battle in the war between the two dragon gods.",
