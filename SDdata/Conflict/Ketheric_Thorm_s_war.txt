'''Ketheric Thorm's war''' was a conflict between the [[chosen]] of [[Shar]], [[Ketheric Thorm]] and the [[Harpers]] , that took place in the [[Chionthar Valley]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

== Conflict pre-history ==
[[File:Thorm Mausoleum fresco 2.png|thumb|240px|[[Ketheric Thorm]] and his dead wife [[Melodia Thorm]].]]

A former faithful worshipper of [[Selûne]], Ketheric Thorm turned to [[Shar]] following the death of his wife [[Melodia Thorm]] and daughter [[Isobel Thorm]]. Some citizens of Reithwin and the [[Shadow-cursed Lands|surrounding lands]] followed Ketheric's example and converted to the Shar's faith out of respect for him and not on religious grounds, but some were the true disciples of the Lady of Loss. ''[[Sharran Registry]]'' bore record to a large amount of people joining Ketheric's cause at that period, including multiple members of noble families. The owner of the ''[[Damaged Journal]]'' was one of examples of the disappointed Selûnites finding their new way in Shar's embrace.

===Selûnite Resistance===
After Ketheric's conversion to Shar, not all inhabitants of the lands controlled by him did the same. Those that did not convert were declared heretics and persecuted. Inquisitor [[Verzen Wranlock]]'s ''[[Investigation Notes]]'' shed light on some measures used in Reithwin to find the worshipers of Selûne.

==Course of the war==
{{Quote|So it is decreed, and so it is done. Wield the power of secret. Where light shines, extinguish it. Heed the Word of your Mistress and Master. Do this, and the Lady of Loss shall know you.|Ketheric's [[Tablet Fragments (Grymforge)|speech scribed on a tablet]].}}

The increasing strain from the ongoing military strife had an impact on the spirits of both parties. As a result, due to the Harpers' regular espionage activities, Sharran adherents found themselves at times punished by the Sharran inquisitors, mistakenly suspected of aiding the enemy. One of such situations was described in Justiciar [[Sybil]]'s ''[[Undelivered Letter]]'' apologizing for her oversight during an investigation in Grymforge. The Harpers also conducted interrogations of the inhabitants of Reithwin and Moonrise Towers using force as evidenced by the ''[[Harper Interrogation Transcript]]''.

On the [[Eleint 23]] or some time before it, Ketheric was poisoned by the Harpers, but managed to survive because of his immortality. (''[[The Waning Moon: Consignments]]'')

===Yurgir's Onslaught===
As Morfred wrote in his log, during the last year of the war, he met [[Raphael]], [[Mephistopheles]]' son, who offered him a [[Infernal contract|bargain]]. Raphael promised to get rid of Ketheric's army in exchange for Morfred's soul. Morfred accepted the offer and was transferred to the [[House of Hope]] where he stayed ever since as an eternal debtor of the [[cambion]].

Raphael fulfilled the deal, sending [[orthon]] [[Yurgir]] and his [[merregon]]s to Grymforge. Within the ''[[Sharran's Journal]]'', there was an account of one of Dark Justiciars witnessing Yurgir's onslaught. Most of the Sharrans were wiped out during the first day. The others continued to fight back or hide for some time as the author of the ''[[Abandoned Journal]]''. The garrisons of the Gauntlet of Shar and of Grymforge slipped out of existence, but Yurgir's contract would remain unfulfilled until [[1492 DR]] as, unknown to him, Raphael had also made a contract with one of Dark Justiciars called [[Lyrthindor]], hiding his presence from the orthon and foredooming Yurgir to wander the Sharran temple for over a century.

=== Shadow Curse===

Following the near-complete destruction of Ketheric's army of Dark Justiciars, his Sharran army was defeated and Ketheric himself killed. Not long after his entombment in the Thorm Mausoleum, however, the lands surrounding Moonrise Towers were stricken with a [[Shadow-cursed lands|shadow curse]], plunging the region into malevolent shadow for over a century. The curse affected the armies of both sides and the locals without distinction, turning many into undead shadows that sought only to consume the living. Halsin's ''[[Druid Notebook]]'' mentions an acquaintance turning into a shadow that possessed a glaive. After the shadow was laid to rest, its glaive was brought to Emerald Grove and named [[Sorrow]] as a constant reminder of what was lost in the war.

==Aftermath==

For many years Emerald Grove druids and Harpers tried to find the way to fight the shadow curse and to heal the lands affected by it.

== Influence==
*[[Roan Featherway]], a druid and Halsin's acquaintance, wrote a "poorly written romance with no basis in fact", called ''[[Shadow's Kiss]]'' around the events of that war.
