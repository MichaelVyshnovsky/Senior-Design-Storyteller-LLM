Ketheric Thorms war was a conflict between the chosen of Shar, Ketheric Thorm and the Harpers , that took place in the Chionthar Valley in the 14 century DR.

A former faithful worshipper of Selûne, Ketheric Thorm turned to Shar following the death of his wife Melodia Thorm and daughter Isobel Thorm. Some citizens of Reithwin and the surrounding lands followed Ketherics example and converted to the Shars faith out of respect for him and not on religious grounds, but some were the true disciples of the Lady of Loss. Sharran Registry bore record to a large amount of people joining Ketherics cause at that period, including multiple members of noble families. The owner of the Damaged Journal was one of examples of the disappointed Selûnites finding their new way in Shars embrace.

After Ketherics conversion to Shar, not all inhabitants of the lands controlled by him did the same. Those that did not convert were declared heretics and persecuted. Inquisitor Verzen Wranlocks Investigation Notes shed light on some measures used in Reithwin to find the worshipers of Selûne.

The increasing strain from the ongoing military strife had an impact on the spirits of both parties. As a result, due to the Harpers regular espionage activities, Sharran adherents found themselves at times punished by the Sharran inquisitors, mistakenly suspected of aiding the enemy. One of such situations was described in Justiciar Sybils Undelivered Letter apologizing for her oversight during an investigation in Grymforge. The Harpers also conducted interrogations of the inhabitants of Reithwin and Moonrise Towers using force as evidenced by the Harper Interrogation Transcript.

On the Eleint 23 or some time before it, Ketheric was poisoned by the Harpers, but managed to survive because of his immortality. (The Waning Moon Consignments)
*Letter of Surrender
As Morfred wrote in his log, during the last year of the war, he met Raphael, Mephistopheles son, who offered him a bargain. Raphael promised to get rid of Ketherics army in exchange for Morfreds soul. Morfred accepted the offer and was transferred to the House of Hope where he stayed ever since as an eternal debtor of the cambion.
Raphael fulfilled the deal, sending orthon Yurgir and his merregons to Grymforge. Within the Sharrans Journal, there was an account of one of Dark Justiciars witnessing Yurgirs onslaught. Most of the Sharrans were wiped out during the first day. The others continued to fight back or hide for some time as the author of the Abandoned Journal. The garrisons of the Gauntlet of Shar and of Grymforge slipped out of existence, but Yurgirs contract would remain unfulfilled until 1492 DR as, unknown to him, Raphael had also made a contract with one of Dark Justiciars called Lyrthindor, hiding his presence from the orthon and foredooming Yurgir to wander the Sharran temple for over a century.

Following the near-complete destruction of Ketherics army of Dark Justiciars, his Sharran army was defeated and Ketheric himself killed. Not long after his entombment in the Thorm Mausoleum, however, the lands surrounding Moonrise Towers were stricken with a shadow curse, plunging the region into malevolent shadow for over a century. The curse affected the armies of both sides and the locals without distinction, turning many into undead shadows that sought only to consume the living. Halsins Druid Notebook mentions an acquaintance turning into a shadow that possessed a glaive. After the shadow was laid to rest, its glaive was brought to Emerald Grove and named Sorrow as a constant reminder of what was lost in the war.

For many years Emerald Grove druids and Harpers tried to find the way to fight the shadow curse and to heal the lands affected by it.
*Roan Featherway, a druid and Halsins acquaintance, wrote a "poorly written romance with no basis in fact", called Shadows Kiss around the events of that war.
