Fey loyal to the Stag King, a dark fey with features of a deer, followed the Rashemi.  Aoth Fezim and his companion Cera Eurthos  circled above the battle and blasted Durthan witches off the battlements and the elemental mage Jhesrhi Coldcreek provided additional fire support for Aoth and his allies. \nThe Durthan were driven back into the catacombs underneath the fortress where most were hunted down and slaughtered by Aoth and his allies although several key Durthan leaders escaped.\nCategoryBattles\nCategoryEvents in Faer√ªn\nCategoryEvents on Toril\nn5gzxcvm4cro0al0o5v31bh5h3b7et8"
