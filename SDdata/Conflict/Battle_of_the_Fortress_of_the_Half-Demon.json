Fey loyal to the [[Stag King]], a dark fey with features of a deer, followed the Rashemi.  Aoth Fezim and his companion [[Cera Eurthos]]  circled above the battle and blasted Durthan [[wizard|witches]] off the battlements and the elemental mage [[Jhesrhi Coldcreek]] provided additional fire support for Aoth and his allies.{{Cite digital book/The Masked Witches/Kindle|3549}} \n\nThe Durthan were driven back into the catacombs underneath the fortress{{Cite digital book/The Masked Witches/Kindle|3379}} where most were hunted down and slaughtered by Aoth and his allies although several key Durthan leaders escaped.",
