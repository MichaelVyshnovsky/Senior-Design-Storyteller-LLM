        "mainbody": "he Cormanthor War was a very complex war fought in Cormanthor and the Dalelands in the late 14 century DR that saw Shadowdale occupied by Zhentil Keep and then liberated, the rout of the daemonfeyt, and ended with the restoration of an elven kingdom in Myth Drannor.\nIn the , after the failed feyri invasion of Evereska, the daemonfey of House Dlardrageth and those released from the Nameless Dungeon followed the suggestion of the fallen solar and yugoloth lord Malkizid and relocated to ruined Myth Drannor on Tarsakh 12, after using a portal network from Myth Glaurach.\nOn Mirtul 6, Dlardrageths legions attacked the temple of Lathandar in Myth Drannor. They destroyed the temple and slaughtered the priests the few survivors escaped through a portal. Scyllua Darkhope of the Zhentarim discovered the feyri presence in Myth Drannor on Mirtul 10. Sarya summoned Malkizid himself to Myth Drannor on Mirtul 13.\nThen, on Mirtul 19, a band of adventurers led by Araevin Teshurr discovered the portal network used by the daemonfey. \nIn Zhentil Keep on Mirtul 22, Scyllua Darkhope, Castellan of Zhentil Keep and High Captain of the Zhentarim, commenced preparations for a march south to Yûlash.\nLearning of the daemonfey escape, Lord Seiveril Miritar, the leader of the Crusade sent from Evermeet to aid [[]], held a Council of War amidst the ruins of Myth Glaurach on Mirtul 24. The Crusade commanders supported his vow to destroy the daemonfey for good, and so used the portal network to journey to Semberholme in Cormanthor, with the aid of the resurrected Fflar Starbrow Melruth. and the Crusade marched north for Mistledale and Shadowdale on Kythorn 1.\nThrough her spies and disguises, on Kythorn 4, Sarya Dlardrageth forged alliances with Sembia and Hillsfar, who were both interested in occupying the nearby Dalelands. and soon after as of Kythorn 16 numerous fiendish troops attacked various Dales, together with Sembian mercenaries and Hillsfars Red Plumes.\nBut First Lord Maalthiir of Hillsfar had used the alliance with Zhentil Keep as a ploy to have the elves destroy the Zhents for him. When the Army of Darkhope and the Crusade were due to clash in Shadowdale, Maalthir ignored Saryas requests to have Hillsfars Red Plumes support the Zhentilar. When she confronted him on this lack of action in the First Lords Tower on Kythorn 21, he admitted his plan to her outrage. They fought with magic, but the feyri escaped. Thus, Hillsfar broke off the alliance with House Dlardrageth,\nLearning of the broken alliance between Hillsfar and Dlardrageth on Kythorn 23, Fzoul withdrew Zhenti Keep from the alliance as well. Seeking to profiting off thje situation, the Zhents started to attack both Hillsfar and Dalesfolk holdings.\nMeanwhile, Dabron Sashenstar of the Merchants League had had their own victory over the Iron Throne and the Zhentarim for control of the arms trade. Seeing a growing opportunity in the war around Cormanthor, Dabron set up business in Arabel, Cormyr, and received orders from the quartermasters of the Crusade, Hillsfar, Sembia, and Zhentil Keep alike.\nIn response to Hillsfars reneging on the alliance, the feyri attacked both the First Lords Tower in Hillsfar and the largest Red Plume camp at the Standing Stone on Kythorn 26. Maalthiir survived but his Tower was severely damaged and by Flamerule 3 the Red Plumes were defeated, the remainder retreating to their home city. Dlardrageths continued attacks on the Sembian mercenaries pushed them to the point of collapse as well.\nFinally, on Flamerule 21, the Standing Stone was destroyed by House Dlardrageth, who then made an alliance with the House Jaelre drow.\nThe Sembians signed a truce with the Crusades emissaries on Eleasis 5. Meanwhile, at Semberholme, House Dlardrageth forces raided the Crusade camp, but were handily repelled. The following day, the Hillsfar garrison at Yûlash were wiped out by the Zhentilar.\nFollowing this, House Jaelre drow assaulted the Crusade and Sembian delegates at Tasseldale on Eleasis 9, though all three took casualties for it. That same day, First Lord Maalthiir of Hillsfar departed his city where to and why is a mystery. Hillsfars western lands were then invaded by the Zhentilar the very next day.\nThe Crusade leaders and Sembia improved their truce to an alliance against House Dlardrageth on Eleasis 11.\nOn Eleasis 17, the Zhentilar laid siege to Hillsfar, with Fzoul Chembryl  of Zhentil Keep issuing terms to High Warden Hardil Gearas, whod been left in charge after Maalthiirs departure. Hillsfar capitulated to Fzoul and the Zhentilar.\nThat same day, the Crusade fought the Dlardrageth legions in the Vale of Lost Voices and the next day drove them from the Vale whilst they banished Malkizid. By Eleasis 20, Crusade forces had encircled Myth Drannor\nLearning of the elven reclamation of Myth Drannor, the powers of Zhentil Keep desired the destruction of the nascent Myth Drannor. To this end, Fzoul held secret negotiations with Jezz the Lame of House Jaelre and representatives of Auzkovyn Clan on Eleasis 27 they all agreed to cooperate against the elves and defeat them before they could gain a foothold. The House Jaelre and Auzkovyn Clan drow allied in the Masked Brigades. For Zhentil Keeps part, Fzoul charged Scyllua Darkhope with leading the war effort. He ordered her to take control of the Moonsea Ride south of Hillsfar by building fortifications down its length.\nFrom Eleint 3 of 1374 DR, the Zhentarim and forces of Myth Drannor began fighting skirmishes up and down the Moonsea Ride, while masked drow conducted targeted assassinations that supported the Black Network. With full-scale conflict between the Army of Myth Drannor and the Army of Darkhope with their Masked Brigades allies, this would be considered the start of the Cormanthor War. Over the following months, both sides would raid and counter-raid the other with ever-greater bloodshed.\nThe Knights of Myth Drannor, together with Storm Silverhand and Dove Falconhand, came to Myth Drannor on Eleint 12 to help defend the city. But in only hours, drow skirmishers drew them into a series of hit-and-run battles in the eastern forests.\nBack in Sembia, Overmaster Kendrick Selkirk was murdered on Eleint 30 and succeeded temporarily by Mirabeta Selkirk on Marpenoth 10. With the threat of civil war rising, Sembia entered into a trade pact and military alliance with the Netherese of Thultanthar. From then on, the realm would be focused on the Sembian Civil War.\nMeanwhile, Fzoul Chembryl of Zhentil Keep allied with Esvele Greycastle of the Church of Shar on Uktar 3 When Scyllua Darkhope returned to Zhentil Keep the next day to take command of another division for the battle for Myth Drannor, she was abruptly ordered by Fzoul to invade Shadowdale instead, this time with the support of the Sharrans and the Dhuurniv drow.\nIn a prelude to the invasion, on Nightal 15, Sharran assassins stealthily entered town of Shadowdale to assault Elminster in his tower. By the battles end, Elminster and his tower had disappeared. With the Old Mage gone, the Zhents managed to occupy Shadowdale town with the help of Sharrans and drow early the following morning. With Zhentarim forces making simultaneous assaults on a number of important elven fortifications in the east, the Army of Myth Drannor were unable to come to their allys aid.\nShockingly, on Nightal 18, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra of Shadowdale welcomed the Army of Darkhope and declared them to be the dales allies and defenders, and even made an alliance with Zhentil Keep.\nAfter almost a tenday, on Nightal 27, Scyllua Darkhope made ready for a march south at the head of two brigades. Her next target was Mistledale. The Zhentarim Occupying Army, comprising the Brigade of Shadows, members of the Church of Bane, and Zhent naug-adar mages, remained behind for the continuing occupation of Shadowdale.\nFinally, Dove Falconhand and Storm Silverhand arrived in Shadowdale at years end at the head of an elite force of elves. Unfortunately,  the silver fire of the two Chosen of Mystra interacted strangely with the Weave in the area, badly injuring them. Compelled to teleport to safety, the elven force was left to deal with the situation as best they could.\nEventually, on Hammer 13 in the , visiting adventurers lifted the possession from Lord Mourngrym and rallied the common folk to Shadowdales defense.\nIn the aftermath, Mourngrym Amcathra abdicated his lordship and went to Myth Drannor to join his fellows in the Knights of Myth Drannor. He was succeeded by Azalar Falconhand. On Hammer 17, Fzoul Chembryl openly scapegoated Scyllua Darkhope for Zhentil Keeps losses in the Cormanthor War, called her the \"Bitch in the Trees\", and declared she would never be resurrected. Learning nothing of fighting wars on multiple fronts, he subsequently had Zhentilar soldiers occupy Phlan and make it another vassal state on Tarsakh 3.\nAlmost a whole year would pass before the divine facet of the War of the Spider Queen being fought contemporaneously amongst the drow led to the death of Vhaeraun on Nightal 20 and the ensuing collapse of his church and its absorption into the Church of Eilistraee. The Masked Brigades were demoralized at their gods death and in the , the elven Army of Myth Drannor quickly routed House Jaelre and Clan Auzkovyn from the Elven Court. The drow were left dispersed and disorganized.\nSoon after, without their drow allies, Zhentil Keep elected to conclude its war with Myth Drannor. A negotiated peace treaty between Fzoul Chembryl and Ilsevele Miritar ceded the forest of Cormanthor to the elves and the open lands north of a line between Hillsfar and Dagger Falls nor came formsllu under the rule of Zhentil Keep. The treaty also gave the Black Network free passage along the Moonsea Ride and Rauthauvars Road, provided they cut no live trees, harmed no elves, and did step beyond thirty paces from the road into the forest.\nThe elves reclamation of Myth Drannor was cemented the following year, when the Srinshee returned to the city after centuries and presented the Rulers Blade to Ilsevele Miritar in honor of her wise rule of the refounded realm. Accepting it, Ilsevele adopted the traditional title of coronal. Queen Amlaruil Moonflower of Evermeet also came to congratulate Ilsevele and gifted the revived realm with the Tree of Souls.\nThe defenders of Myth Drannor were known as the Army of Myth Drannor.\nThe Zhentish army was called the Army of Darkhope, after its commander, Scyllua Darkhope.\nThe Masked Brigades were a force of Vhaeraun-following drow from House Jaelre and the Auzkovyn Clan."
