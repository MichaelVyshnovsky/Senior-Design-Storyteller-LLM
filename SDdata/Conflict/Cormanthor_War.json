        "History": {
            "Daemonfey Occupation of Myth Drannor": "In the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, after the failed [[fey'ri invasion of Evereska]], the [[daemonfey]] of [[House Dlardrageth]] and those released from the [[Nameless Dungeon]] followed the suggestion of the fallen [[solar]] and [[yugoloth]] lord [[Malkizid]] and relocated to ruined Myth Drannor on [[Tarsakh 12]], after using a [[portal]] network from [[Myth Glaurach]].\n\nOn [[Mirtul 6]], Dlardrageth's legions attacked the [[Dawnspire|temple of Lathandar]] in Myth Drannor. They destroyed the temple and slaughtered the [[Seekers of the Dawn|priests]]; the few survivors escaped through a [[portal]]. [[Scyllua Darkhope]] of the [[Zhentarim]] discovered the [[fey'ri]] presence in Myth Drannor on [[Mirtul 10]]. Sarya summoned Malkizid himself to Myth Drannor on [[Mirtul 13]].\n\nThen, on [[Mirtul 19]], a band of adventurers led by [[Araevin Teshurr]] discovered the portal network used by the daemonfey. \n\nIn Zhentil Keep on [[Mirtul 22]], Scyllua Darkhope, Castellan of Zhentil Keep and High Captain of the Zhentarim, commenced preparations for a march south to [[Yûlash]].\n\nLearning of the daemonfey escape, Lord [[Seiveril Miritar]], the leader of the [[Seiveril's Crusade|Crusade]] sent from [[Evermeet]] to aid [[]], held a Council of War amidst the ruins of Myth Glaurach on [[Mirtul 24]]. The Crusade commanders supported his vow to destroy the daemonfey for good, and so used the portal network to journey to [[Semberholme]] in Cormanthor, with the aid of the resurrected [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]]. and the Crusade marched north for Mistledale and Shadowdale on [[Kythorn 1]].",
            "Short-lived Daemonfey Alliance with Hillsfar, Sembia, and Zhentil Keep": "Through her spies and disguises, on [[Kythorn 4]], Sarya Dlardrageth forged alliances with [[Sembia]] and [[Hillsfar]], who were both interested in occupying the nearby [[Dalelands]]. and soon after as of [[Kythorn 16]] numerous [[fiend]]ish troops attacked various Dales, together with Sembian mercenaries and Hillsfar's [[Red Plumes]].\n\nBut First Lord [[Maalthiir]] of Hillsfar had used the alliance with Zhentil Keep as a ploy to have the elves destroy the Zhents for him. When the Army of Darkhope and the Crusade were due to clash in Shadowdale, Maalthir ignored Sarya's requests to have Hillsfar's Red Plumes support the Zhentilar. When she confronted him on this lack of action in the [[First Lord's Tower]] on [[Kythorn 21]], he admitted his plan to her outrage. They fought with magic, but the fey'ri escaped. Thus, Hillsfar broke off the alliance with House Dlardrageth,\n\nLearning of the broken alliance between Hillsfar and Dlardrageth on [[Kythorn 23]], Fzoul withdrew Zhenti Keep from the alliance as well. Seeking to profiting off thje situation,<ref> the Zhents started to attack both Hillsfar and Dalesfolk holdings.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Dabron Sashenstar]] of the [[Merchant's League]] had had their own victory over the [[Iron Throne]] and the Zhentarim for control of the arms trade. Seeing a growing opportunity in the war around Cormanthor, Dabron set up business in [[Arabel]], [[Cormyr]], and received orders from the quartermasters of the Crusade, Hillsfar, Sembia, and Zhentil Keep alike.\n\nIn response to Hillsfar's reneging on the alliance, the fey'ri attacked both the [[First Lord's Tower]] in Hillsfar and the largest Red Plume camp at the [[Standing Stone]] on [[Kythorn 26]]. Maalthiir survived but his Tower was severely damaged and by [[Flamerule 3]] the Red Plumes were defeated, the remainder retreating to their home city. Dlardrageth's continued attacks on the Sembian mercenaries pushed them to the point of collapse as well.",
            "Daemonfey Ally with the Drow; Sembia Switches Sides; and Zhentil Keep Turns on Hillsfar": "Finally, on [[Flamerule 21]], the Standing Stone was destroyed by House Dlardrageth, who then made an alliance with the House Jaelre drow.\n\nThe Sembians signed a truce with the Crusade's emissaries on [[Eleasis 5]]. Meanwhile, at Semberholme, House Dlardrageth forces raided the Crusade camp, but were handily repelled. The [[Eleasis 6|following day]], the Hillsfar garrison at Yûlash were wiped out by the Zhentilar.\n\nFollowing this, House Jaelre drow assaulted the Crusade and Sembian delegates at Tasseldale on [[Eleasis 9]], though all three took casualties for it. That same day, First Lord Maalthiir of Hillsfar departed his city; where to and why is a mystery. Hillsfar's western lands were then invaded by the Zhentilar the [[Eleasis 10|very next day]].\n\nThe Crusade leaders and Sembia improved their truce to an alliance against House Dlardrageth on [[Eleasis 11]].",
            "Zhentil Keep Takes Hillsfar; the Crusade Takes Myth Drannor": "On [[Eleasis 17]], the Zhentilar laid siege to Hillsfar, with [[Fzoul Chembryl]]  of Zhentil Keep issuing terms to High Warden [[Hardil Gearas]], who'd been left in charge after Maalthiir's departure. Hillsfar capitulated to Fzoul and the Zhentilar.\n\nThat same day, the Crusade fought the Dlardrageth legions in the [[Vale of Lost Voices]] and the [[Eleasis 18|next day]] drove them from the Vale whilst they banished Malkizid. By [[Eleasis 20]], Crusade forces had encircled Myth Drannor",
            "Myth Drannor versus Zhentil Keep and the Drow": "Learning of the elven reclamation of Myth Drannor, the powers of Zhentil Keep desired the destruction of the nascent Myth Drannor. To this end, Fzoul held secret negotiations with [[Jezz the Lame]] of House Jaelre and representatives of [[Auzkovyn Clan]] on [[Eleasis 27]]; they all agreed to cooperate against the elves and defeat them before they could gain a foothold. The House Jaelre and Auzkovyn Clan drow allied in the Masked Brigades. For Zhentil Keep's part, Fzoul charged Scyllua Darkhope with leading the war effort. He ordered her to take control of the Moonsea Ride south of Hillsfar by building fortifications down its length.\n\nFrom [[Eleint 3]] of 1374 DR, the Zhentarim and forces of Myth Drannor began fighting skirmishes up and down the Moonsea Ride, while masked drow conducted targeted assassinations that supported the Black Network. With full-scale conflict between the Army of Myth Drannor and the Army of Darkhope with their Masked Brigades allies, this would be considered the start of the Cormanthor War. Over the following months, both sides would raid and counter-raid the other with ever-greater bloodshed.\n\nThe [[Knights of Myth Drannor]], together with [[Storm Silverhand]] and [[Dove Falconhand]], came to Myth Drannor on [[Eleint 12]] to help defend the city. But in only hours, drow skirmishers drew them into a series of hit-and-run battles in the eastern forests.\n\nBack in Sembia, Overmaster [[Kendrick Selkirk]] was murdered on [[Eleint 30]] and succeeded temporarily by [[Mirabeta Selkirk]] on [[Marpenoth 10]]. With the threat of civil war rising, Sembia entered into a trade pact and military alliance with the [[Netherese]] of [[Thultanthar]]. From then on, the realm would be focused on the [[Sembian Civil War]].\n\nMeanwhile, Fzoul Chembryl of Zhentil Keep allied with [[Esvele Greycastle]] of the [[Church of Shar]] on [[Uktar 3]] When Scyllua Darkhope returned to Zhentil Keep the [[Eleint 1|next day]] to take command of another division for the battle for Myth Drannor, she was abruptly ordered by Fzoul to invade Shadowdale instead, this time with the support of the Sharrans and the Dhuurniv drow.",
            "Invasion of Shadowdale": "In a prelude to the invasion, on [[Nightal 15]], Sharran assassins stealthily entered [[Shadowdale (town)|town of Shadowdale]] to assault [[Elminster]] in his [[Elminster's tower|tower]]. By the battle's end, Elminster and his tower had disappeared. With the Old Mage gone, the Zhents managed to occupy Shadowdale town with the help of Sharrans and drow early the [[Nightal 16|following morning]]. With Zhentarim forces making simultaneous assaults on a number of important elven fortifications in the east, the Army of Myth Drannor were unable to come to their ally's aid.{{Cite dragon/Cormanthor: War Amidst the Trees|71}}\n\nShockingly, on [[Nightal 18]], Lord [[Mourngrym Amcathra]] of Shadowdale welcomed the Army of Darkhope and declared them to be the dale's allies and defenders, and even made an alliance with Zhentil Keep.\n\nAfter almost a [[tenday]], on [[Nightal 27]], Scyllua Darkhope made ready for a march south at the head of two brigades. Her next target was Mistledale. The [[Zhentarim Occupying Army]], comprising the [[Brigade of Shadows]], members of the [[Church of Bane]], and Zhent [[naug-adar]] mages, remained behind for the continuing occupation of Shadowdale.\n\nFinally, Dove Falconhand and Storm Silverhand arrived in Shadowdale at [[Nightal 30|year's end]] at the head of an elite force of elves. Unfortunately,  the [[silver fire]] of the two [[Chosen of Mystra]] interacted strangely with the [[Weave]] in the area, badly injuring them. Compelled to [[teleport]] to safety, the elven force was left to deal with the situation as best they could.\n\nEventually, on [[Hammer 13]] in the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, visiting [[adventurer]]s lifted the possession from Lord Mourngrym and rallied the common folk to Shadowdale's defense.\n\nIn the aftermath, Mourngrym Amcathra abdicated his lordship and went to Myth Drannor to join his fellows in the Knights of Myth Drannor. He was succeeded by [[Azalar Falconhand]]. On [[Hammer 17]], Fzoul Chembryl openly scapegoated Scyllua Darkhope for Zhentil Keep's losses in the Cormanthor War, called her the \"Bitch in the Trees\", and declared she would never be [[Resurrection (spell)|resurrected]]. Learning nothing of fighting wars on multiple fronts, he subsequently had Zhentilar soldiers occupy [[Phlan]] and make it another vassal state on [[Tarsakh 3]].",
            "End of the War at Last": "Almost a whole year would pass before the divine facet of the [[War of the Spider Queen]] being fought contemporaneously amongst the drow led to the death of Vhaeraun on [[Nightal 20]] and the ensuing collapse of [[Church of Vhaeraun|his church]] and its absorption into the [[Church of Eilistraee]]. The Masked Brigades were demoralized at their god's death and in the {{YearlinkName|1376}}, the elven Army of Myth Drannor quickly routed House Jaelre and Clan Auzkovyn from the [[Elven Court]]. The drow were left dispersed and disorganized.\n\nSoon after, without their drow allies, Zhentil Keep elected to conclude its war with Myth Drannor. A negotiated peace treaty between Fzoul Chembryl and [[Ilsevele Miritar]] ceded the forest of Cormanthor to the elves and the open lands north of a line between Hillsfar and [[Dagger Falls]] nor came formsllu under the rule of Zhentil Keep. The treaty also gave the Black Network free passage along the [[Moonsea Ride]] and [[Rauthauvar's Road]], provided they cut no live trees, harmed no elves, and did step beyond thirty paces from the road into the forest.\n\nThe elves' reclamation of Myth Drannor was cemented the [[1377 DR|following year]], when the [[Srinshee]] returned to the city after centuries and presented the ''[[Ruler's Blade]]'' to Ilsevele Miritar in honor of her wise rule of the refounded realm. Accepting it, Ilsevele adopted the traditional title of [[coronal]]. Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] of Evermeet also came to congratulate Ilsevele and gifted the revived realm with the ''[[Tree of Souls]]''."

        "Combatants": "The defenders of Myth Drannor were known as the [[Army of Myth Drannor]].\n\nThe Zhentish army was called the [[Army of Darkhope]], after its commander, [[Scyllua Darkhope]].\n\nThe [[Masked Brigades]] were a force of [[Vhaeraun]]-following [[drow]] from [[House Jaelre]] and the [[Auzkovyn Clan]]."
