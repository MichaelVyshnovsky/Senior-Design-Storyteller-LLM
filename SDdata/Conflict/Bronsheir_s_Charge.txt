The Bronsheirs Charge was a battle fought between feuding factions of the church of Ilmater in the Year of the Groaning Hart, 1267 DR.
Holy war had broken out around 1265 DR when Archsufferer Bloirt Waelarn of the House of the Broken God in Keltar had denounced his fellow Ilmatari priests of the House of Holy Suffering in Mussum for refusing to relinquish the Tome of Torment, the holiest book of the faith. On one side were the Mussum priests and the Companions of the Noble Heart paladin order, and on the other were Waelarn, his followers, the Holy Warriors of Suffering, and the Knights of the Bleeding Shield.
