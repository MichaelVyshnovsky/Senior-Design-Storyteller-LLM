The '''Bronsheir's Charge''' was a battle fought between feuding factions of the [[church of Ilmater]] in the [[1267 DR|Year of the Groaning Hart, 1267 DR]].

==Events==
Holy war had broken out around [[1265 DR]] when Archsufferer [[Bloirt Waelarn]] of the [[House of the Broken God]] in [[Keltar]] had denounced his fellow Ilmatari priests of the [[House of Holy Suffering]] in [[Mussum]] for refusing to relinquish the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', the holiest book of the faith. On one side were the Mussum priests and the [[Companions of the Noble Heart]] paladin order, and on the other were Waelarn, his followers, the [[Holy Warriors of Suffering]], and the [[Knights of the Bleeding Shield]].

Bronsheir's Charge was a bloody battle.
