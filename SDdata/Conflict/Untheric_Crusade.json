        "mainbody": "The '''Untheric Crusade''' was a conflict between the nations of [[Mulhorand]] and [[Unther]] that took place in the late years of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": {
            "Background": "In response to the death of [[Gilgeam|Gilgeam the Tyrant]] and the insistence of the god [[Anhur]] for Mulhorand to take a more active role in the world, the [[pharaoh]] of Mulhorand, [[Horustep III]], allowed the [[cleric]]s of Anhur to cross the [[River of Swords]] and invade their long-time rival nation. Assisted by a [[mercenary]] company, the [[Gold Swords]], Mulhorand invaded Unther in [[1371 DR]].",
            "Conflict": "The initial campaign was incredible successful, and the Mulhorandi forces were able to conquer all of Unther, with the exception of [[Messemprar]]. However, a few Untherite rebel forces, led by the [[Northern Wizards]], keep fighting and were able to repel the Mulhorandi forces, mostly thanks to the secret support of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]], who didn't want to allow Mulhorand to create a new empire.\n\nAs the conflict raged, new factions became involved, such as the churches of [[Tiamat]], Gilgeam, and [[Hoar]], that opposed the Mulhorandi occupation forces.{{Cite dragon/358/Volo's Guide: War upon the Sands|70-71}} Irregular forces such as the [[Gray Ghost]] bandits, the [[wizard]]s of [[the Enclave]], and the [[Rebels of the Moon]], also joined the fight against the Mulhorandi.{{Cite dragon/358/Volo's Guide: War upon the Sands|73}}\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], the conflict turned in favor of the Untherite rebels when followers of [[Bane]] from [[Mourktar]] aided the defense of Messemprar, reinforcing the besieged defenders of that city. The mysterious [[Legion of Nanna-Sin]] also helped them fight against the other Mulhorandi forces in the southern regions of Unther.\n\nThe conflict lasted until [[1379 DR]], when the Mulhorandi were finally able to conquer the city of Messemprar, putting an end to the conflict at last.",
            "Aftermath": "With Messemprar finally under Mulhorandi control, Unther became a province of Mulhorand, ushering in the short-lived \"Third Mulhorandi Empire\"."
