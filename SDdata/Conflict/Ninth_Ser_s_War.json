There, Tarag founded the two Axe Kingdoms of Khuur and Nmalk.\nThe Axe Kingdoms and Hmurrath fell to fighting in the Year of the Killing Blow, 653 DR, beginning the Ninth Serôs War.\nThe merrow suffered a major defeat in the Battle of the Haunted Plains in the Year of the Coveted Briars, 654 DR. Following their defeat, four-fifths of all merrow in Serôs were forced to flee south to the other side of the Sharksbane Wall. The rest survived on the Hmur Plateau or living amidst the ruins on the Haunted Plains.\nThree years of conflict culminated in the destruction of the Axe Kingdoms and the fall of the merrow to the merfolk of Hmurrath in the Year of the Volanth, 655 DR. This saw the end of merrow \"civilization\" in Serôs.\nCategoryWars\nCategoryEvents in the Axe Kingdoms\nCategoryEvents in Hmurrath\nCategoryEvents on the Hmur Plateau\nCategoryEvents in Serôs\nCategoryEvents in Interior Faerûn\nCategoryEvents in Faerûn\nCategoryEvents on Toril\n73evk4jlqljzpbonyi9y6t9jicm1l9b"
