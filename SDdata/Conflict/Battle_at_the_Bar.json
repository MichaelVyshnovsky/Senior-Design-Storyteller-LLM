        "mainbody": "The '''Battle at the Bar''' was a fight that broke out in the common room of the [[Whistling Wizard]] inn sometime around the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]]. It involved two independent and uncoordinated [[Harper]] groups, members of a slavery and smuggling ring known as the [[Tarntar]], an [[illithid]], an [[ogre mage]], at least two [[doppelganger]]s, various bodyguards, and eventually the local law enforcers.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|34}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 28: The Recent and Colorful History of the Wizard}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|36}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 30: Endgame at the Wizard}}",
        "Location": "The Whistling Wizard inn was located on the outskirts of [[Voonlar]] where the [[North Ride]] emerged from the forest when traveling north from [[Shadowdale (town)|Shadowdale]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|29}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 24: An Inn For Adventurers}}",
        "History": {
            "Causes": "The Whistling Wizard was also home to the [[Wizard Well]], a water-filled cistern in the basement that was known to talk to individuals who came in peace. The Well was actually haunted by a female [[spectral harpist]] named [[Zarracee Ambroanye]] that gathered information and passed messages to Harper agents that came through Voonlar. She became sufficiently alarmed at the presence of so many suspicious or evil characters visiting or living in the inn that she eventually decided to send a message through the Harper network to [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] in Shadowdale and beg for intervention and removal of the numerous imposters lurking there.\n\nThe messenger Zarracee chose was one already on the way to Shadowdale to report to [[Storm Silverhand]], and therefore the Bard of Shadowdale heard about the spectral harpist's concerns in passing, and decided to act. She called upon her sister, the [[Simbul]] for aid and the Simbul readily agreed and brought along six of her eager apprentices for the experience. When news of Zarracee's plea reached Elminster's ears, he allowed the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] to handle the situation as they saw fit. Knights [[Sharantyr]], [[Jhessail Silvertree]], and [[Illistyl Elventree]] organized a strike team of about twenty-five Harper agents and made their way to Voonlar. Unbeknownst to the Knights/Harper team, the Storm/Simbul team was doing the same, and got there first.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 29: The Battle at the Bar}}\n\nAmong the guests in the common room of the Whistling Wizard that afternoon were members of a [[Sembia]]n crime syndicate known as the Tarntar. Present were the [[evoker]] [[Alro Randulkyn|Alro \"Five Flames\" Randulkyn]], the [[illusionist]] [[Skulto Mreth]], the wizard and so-called Master-of-Moons [[Hastammer Orlim]], a trader in cosmetics named [[Ghaurann Rhee]], and a dealer in furs and leather clothing, [[Tharath Shemmer]]. There were also other minor peddlers, apprentices, [[familiar]]s, bodyguards, wagon drivers, and attendants scattered throughout the common room, the inn, and the stableyard.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|35}}\n\nThe Simbul apparently [[scry|scried]] the room and recognized the Tarntar spellcasters, or [[divination|divined]] their names and backgrounds, because she altered her appearance to mimic the Sage of Shadowdale (right down to the smoking pipe that floated beside his head) and walked straight into the den of thieves and began to tease, cajole, and advise them about their personal life, their religious affiliations, and their slavery business. The audience was speechless and the mages knew better than to trade spells against Elminster himself, but when he grinned, sat in Hastammer's lap, and changed into a woman, the battle was on.",
            "Battle": "If the mages who cast the first attack spells had recognized the Witch-Queen of [[Aglarond]], the Battle at the Bar might never have begun. But this was not the case. Hastammer's associates immediately cast deadly spells at the Simbul even as she sat across his lap. She shrugged off the attacks, laughed out loud to signal her compatriots to join the fun, and then took up a defensive posture to protect the inn from major damage while her apprentices took on the Tarntar with the help of Storm.\n\nAs Storm and the apprentices rushed into the common room, merchants and attendants scattered to find or fetch their bodyguards. The Knights of Myth Drannor and two dozen Harper agents were approaching the inn when they observed people pouring out of windows and doors, running and shouting, and quickly joined the fray with the initial intent to quell the riot. The battle soon raged up and down the (mostly dark) halls and staircases of the inn and around the grounds. Zarracee flew from room to room, passing through walls and floors, with reports and warnings for the Harper troops.\n\nWhen someone fled or was chased into the cookhouse, their panic infected the doppelgangers into thinking they had been revealed. At this time, the Zhentarim was the major power in Voonlar, having control over the Bron (local sheriff) and his deputies and the backing of the local [[Dark God Reformed|temple of Cyric]], so the shapeshifters took on the form of what they believed was the most feared and respected beings in Voonlar: Zhentarim wizards. The sight of their arch-enemy put the Knights of Myth Drannor and the Harpers into full battle cry and escalated the fighting to a zealous fervor. These new developments also brought Gathkatra (the ogre-mage) and Klondras Imdree (the illithid archmage) into the widening conflict.\n\nAs the battle raged around the inn, the epicenter was still in the common room, and specifically, the bar. The wood of the counter was enchanted with ''[[firequench]]'' like most of the inn, but it also was the recipient of various ''[[magic mouth]]'' spells that laid dormant, each awaiting the specific trigger to deliver its message. It is believed that this overly-enchanted furniture was subject to many battle spells being thrown at or near it and this proved to be too much for maintaining arcane and structural integrity. In short, it exploded.\n\nThe explosion of the bar instantly killed the owner Ravvas, \"Five Flames\" Randulkyn, and Tharath Shemmer who were in close proximity, either backed up to the counter or using it as cover. The blast was so great that a good portion of the ceiling was destroyed. At the time, Gathkatra was engaged in battle in the manager's apartments just above the bar and was tossed into the air and fell through the hole to her death by impalement on the debris. Collaterally, the mind flayer Klondras was in mid-transformation to a different form when it was struck on the head by some explosively accelerated projectile and suffered major damage to its brain.\n\nIn the confusion immediately after the explosion, Hastammer Orlim cast a spell on himself and grew extra arms, each equipped with a [[dagger]], that he proceeded to thrust into the Simbul. With no less than six hilts protruding from her torso, the Simbul turned her wrath on Hastammer, whose triumphant smile was quickly reduced to sniveling and grovelling for his life. Either he was a good actor or the Witch-Queen was feeling generous that day because she stayed her hand, but the dastard repaid her mercy by causing the daggers in her body to detonate. Storm Silverhand furiously decapitated him with a single stoke of her blade as ''[[contingency]]'' spells and effects brought a bubble of healing liquid into which the Simbul's torn body fell, close to death.\n\nAs Storm and the apprentices rallied around the queen to give aid and protection, some deputies of the local law enforcement in Voonlar showed up with weapons drawn and a gaggle of gawking commoners were not far behind. One of the deputies unwisely tried to disarm and direct an unknown spellcaster and she, being an apprentice of the Simbul, sent him flying back up the road to the Throat (the crossroads at the center of town), ricocheting painfully off of obstacles on the way. The Harpers present were still seeing red and launched an attack on the remaining deputies who quickly retreated before overwhelming numbers.",
            "Aftermath": "The healing sphere quickly mended the Simbul's body and restored her to full health, although she needed a change of clothes. After seeing two of their number get blown up and a third beheaded, the remaining Tarntar fled as the deputies arrived and distracted their opponents. The ogre-mage Gathkatra died in the fall onto sharply pointed wreckage in the common room. The illithid was unable to transform or cast spells and was last seen in a morphologically ambiguous form, screaming and running into the forest. The doppelgangers were believed to be vanquished, but history has not yet revealed any proof of this. At the very least, they fled in the face of so many enemies and the kitchen staff was cleansed. The common room and several second-story rooms were a shambles in need of major repair and refurnishing.\n\nThe Knights of Myth Drannor and the Harpers were somewhat chagrined at the amount of damage the battle had caused and their open confrontation with the Voonlarren authorities, perhaps worried that future dealings with Voonlar would be met with harsher treatment for Harpers. They deferred to Storm and the Simbul since they had arrived first and clearly knew more about the situation than the Knights were led to believe. As they all departed the scene, Storm gave [[Avlar]], the elderly bartender who miraculously survived, a bag of gold and gems to easily cover the needed repairs.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 31: The Wizard Then to Now}}"

        "Combatants": {
            "Casualties": "The Harpers suffered no deaths, although the Simbul received catastrophic damage and only her ''contingency'' magics saved her. The Tarntar lost Alro, Hastammer, and Tharath, the rest got away. Of the residents, the owner, Ravvas, the ogre-mage disguised as the chatelaine, Gathkatra, and the mind flayer disguised as Klondras all perished. The doppelgangers either fled or were destroyed. The deputies of Voonlar suffered mainly wounds to their pride as they retreated before overwhelming numbers."
