        "mainbody": "The '''Battle of Caer Moray''' was a brief assault on the [[lycanthrope]]-held castle at [[Caer Moray]] on the Isle of [[Moray]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]].\n\nLycanthropes loyal to the [[god]] [[Malar]] attacked the settlement at night. They attempted to use rough-cut logs as ladders to scale the castle walls but were initially repelled. They attacked again with renewed vigor and succeeded in gaining the walls and took part of the castle courtyard.{{Cite digital book/The Rose of Sarifal/Kindle|2224}}\n\nAt this time an incarnation of the goddess [[Chauntea]] intervened and caused an earthquake and subsequent tsunami that swept the attackers out to sea.  Part of the castle's wall was destroyed by the tsunami and the defenders suffered a large number of casualties in the attack.{{Cite digital book/The Rose of Sarifal/Kindle|2522}}",
