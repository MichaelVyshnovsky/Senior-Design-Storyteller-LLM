They attempted to use rough-cut logs as ladders to scale the castle walls but were initially repelled. They attacked again with renewed vigor and succeeded in gaining the walls and took part of the castle courtyard.\nAt this time an incarnation of the goddess Chauntea intervened and caused an earthquake and subsequent tsunami that swept the attackers out to sea.  Part of the castles wall was destroyed by the tsunami and the defenders suffered a large number of casualties in the attack.\nCategoryBattles\nCategoryEvents in Caer Moray\nCategoryEvents on Moray\nCategoryEvents in the Moonshae Isles\nCategoryEvents in West Faerûn\nCategoryEvents in Faerûn\nCategoryEvents on Toril\nbw367rx57kyh3lfqe8zh55g13lca5gw"
