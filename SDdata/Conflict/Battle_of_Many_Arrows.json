        "mainbody": "The Battle of Many Arrows was a great siege in which a horde of orcs conquered the fortress-city of Citadel Felbarr in the 12 century DR, leading to it becoming an orcish stronghold known as the Citadel of Many Arrows.\nThe siege took place at Citadel Felbarr in the Rauvin Mountains.\nThe battle came about when an orc horde of terrible size arose in Dead Orc Pass during the . Led by a chieftain known as Obould, this force marched west to surround the nearby Citadel Felbarr. At that time, the ancient dwarven fortress-city had been abandoned by the dwarves and turned over to Silverymoon, which had used it for the preceding fifty years as an outpost and garrison. There were 3,000 soldiers defending the Citadel against the orcs.\nFor four months, the orcs threw themselves against the walls of the citadel, seemingly heedless of their losses. The conflict came to be known as the Battle of \"Many Arrows\" because the defenders fired every arrow they had into the horde, who simply kept climbing over the dead to swarm the walls. Finally, the orcs overwhelmed the garrison and slaughtered them to a man, save for a single wizard who managed to teleport away and recount the events of the battle.\nWith their victory over the defenders, the orcs moved into Felbarr, which came to be known as the Citadel of Many Arrows. They remained deeply entrenched there, harassing the surrounding cities,"
