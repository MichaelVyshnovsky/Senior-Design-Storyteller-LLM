        "mainbody": "The '''Reclamation Wars''', also known as the '''Tethyrian Civil War''', was a series of conflicts that centered around [[Zaranda Star]], the Countess of [[Morninggold]], and her efforts to unite the kingdom of [[Tethyr]] during the last years of the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]] of the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Background": {
            "Days of Terror": "In [[Tarsakh]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Zaranda and her mercenary company traveled to [[Ithmong]] and negotiated a contract with the city's ruling council. At the end of the talks, one of the members of her company proved himself a traitor by drugging Zaranda and kidnapping her back to Zazesspur before anyone knew she was gone. During the four days in the end of Tarsakh and the beginning of [[Mirtul]], which came to be known as the \"Days of Terror\", Zazesspur was left in utter chaos. [[Zhentarim]] slavers were discovered under the city; a \"darkling\"{{Darkling clarification}} army was unleashed onto the streets of the city; Baron Hardisty's advisor, [[Armenides]], a professed priest of [[Ao]], was revealed to be an evil fraud; and the children of the city's nobles murdered their parents while under the influence of evil [[magic]].\n\nDuring the confusion & terror, Zaranda escaped Zazesspur's dungeons with the aid of [[Shield of Innocence]], an [[orog]] [[paladin]] of [[Torm]] she had met and accepted the year before, as well as her friends including [[Vander Stillhawk]]. Just before dawn on [[Mirtul 3]], the group ventured into the [[Underdark]] and defeated the [[deepspawn]] known as [[One Below|The One Below]], which was behind all of the mayhem. \n\nWhen she emerged back into Zazesspur, the citizens of the city declared her as their queen. She would only accepted the adulations under the condition that all of the people of Tethyr would express the same desire and understand that she ruled for the will of the people. The 3{{rd}} of Mirtul would come to be known as [[Crowning Day]] in Zazesspur.",
            "Tour of Tethyr": "Zaranda spent the month of Mirtul helping to rebuild Zazesspur and in [[Kythorn]] she met with other nobles, [[Alaric Hembreon|Duke Hembreon]] and the Lords [[Inselm Hhune|Hhune]] and [[Faunce]] to plan on how to win the support of the rest of Tethyr. By [[Flamerule]], she began her tour of the country. Her first stop was the port city of [[Velen]] who greeted her as their queen on the merit of her reputation alone yet that didn't stop her from putting an end to threat of the pirates of the neighboring town of [[Tulmene]]. Zaranda had gained the support of the entire coastal region, including the [[archdruid]] of [[Mosstone]], by [[Higharvestide]].\n\nRather than traveling south to [[Myratma]] for the winter she took her followers to Ithmong when she heard tell of a new tyrant residing there with his own royal aspirations. Allied with the [[Company of Eight]] and with Star Protective Services swelling with new recruits from the coast, Zaranda's laid siege to the city in a short, and nearly bloodless battle.",
            "Battle of Myratma": "The {{YearlinkName|1368}}, saw [[ogre]]s and [[goblin]]s swarm out of the [[Kuldin Peaks]] and Forest of Tethir. One [[half-ogre]] even managed to organize an army of mercenaries and bandits in an attempt to create a monstrous city at [[Survale Ford]] but his efforts were quickly derailed. Zaranda gained the support of [[Saradush]] after rescuing their leader, [[Oon Santele]], from kidnappers and was officially recognized by [[Siamorphe]] as a rightful ruler, and accepted by the [[Order of the Silver Chalice]]. This put an end to any doubts Zaranda had as to whether or not she should be queen.\n\nZaranda's next target was [[Myratma]] but she was long delayed. Once there she and her \"Loyalist Army\" found the city occupied by [[Yusef Jhannivvar]], a man claiming to be of royal blood who refused to accept Zaranda's rule. He commanded a large force, including many magicians who rained destruction down onto the Loyalist Army. A month-long siege began and Zaranda's losses were staggering. Reinforcements arrived in the form of armies led by men who demanded noble titles in exchange for their help. Unfortunately these men had no tactical experience and their help only led to the deaths of more soldiers. Zaranda and three of her four surviving commanders were captured by Yusef. Two thirds of her army lay dead and that final third fled to [[Saharkhan]] to regroup. At the same time, all but one of the council of lords in Zazesspur broke their ties with Zaranda. They had revealed themselves to be traitors; either in an attempt to claim more power for themselves, or because they were secretly allied with prince Yusef for some time.",
            "Heir Apparent": "While all of this was going on in Tethyr, a well-respected scribe in [[Shadowdale]] known as [[Lhaeo]] was informed by [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] that he was the rightful king of Tethyr, his existence as Alemander IV's second son kept secret by a powerful few after his birth in [[Silverymoon]] 33 years earlier. Khelben bullied him into accepting his destiny and when he finally relented, Lhaeo, now known by his birth-name of [[Haedrak III|Haedrak]], spent the next 8 months studying swordplay and [[magic]]. He was granted a magically-enhanced [[pseudodragon]] [[familiar]], [[Purlakhonthiis]], the royal regalia of Tethyr, including the ''[[Monarch's Scepter]]'', and several other powerful magic items before his master [[Elminster]] bade him farewell.\n\nThe wise old sage opened a ''[[portal]]'' for him to [[Voonlar]] where Haedrak began recruiting allies before teleporting to Silverymoon where he and his new companions started planning what to do when they arrived in Tethyr. He traveled to [[Waterdeep]] first where he was announce by Khelben and [[Piergeiron Paladinson]] as the last true scion of Tethyr before the [[Nobility of Waterdeep|nobility of the city]]. Many pledged their support of his cause and an army soon marched behind Haedrak and his allies. His forces arrived by sea and land in Zazesspur in [[Uktar]] to find a city divided. Bolstered by [[Tyr]]ran paladins on a holy crusade to bring justice to Tethyr, Haedrak's army intimidated the splintered council of lords back into cohesion. Some people wanted to back Haedrak's claim to the throne but, trying to avoid more division, Haedrak made a public statement that he was not in Tethyr to claim the throne himself but to support Zaranda Star and encouraged everyone to do the same. He sent his ships, led by [[Corinna Dezlentyr|Lady Dezlentyr]] to blockade Myratma and marched his army overland to join up with the last of the Loyalist Army before starting a second siege of the city.\n\nTwelve days into the second siege, prince Yusef, after killing her commanders, ordered Zaranda removed from Myratma, fearing this second army would free her and remove any advantage he had built up. Haedrak used another ring to teleport himself, his familiar and a centaur named [[Timoth Eyesbright|Timoth]] to wherever Zaranda was located. An ancient [[mythal]] disrupted the teleport and the trio were separated. Haedrak found Zaranda first, unconscious and about to be devoured by a [[hell hound]]. He killed the beast and healed Zaranda's injuries with potions. The four regrouped and Zaranda led them outside where they could teleport back to the siege line. Zaranda took command of the troops and maintained the siege into the [[1369 DR|following year]].",
            "Siege of Myratma": "Though his strength was weakened by the slave uprising, a lack of supplies, befouled water sources and magically weakened walls, Yusef and his [[mage]]s managed to keep his foe's main force outside the walls for three months time. News reached Zaranda that unrest in Darromar, Saradush and the [[Ithal Pass]] was leading to an increasingly deteriorating state of affairs. \n\nRealizing that she needed to end the siege so that she could restore order to her cities, but unable to do much more, Zaranda was relieved when a storm erupted over the city in [[Ches 30]]. She had the druids and [[cleric]]s of her army cast ''[[control lightning]]'' spells that struck the walls. A day and a night passed before over a dozen lightning bolts simultaneously struck the city barbican, leveling it and allowing her forces to charge inside. Surprisingly, many slaves had survived the revolt and impeded the army's charge by attempting to escape through the same opening that Zaranda's forces were using to enter. Yusef himself attempted to escape in the guise of a slave, but he was discovered and forced into single combat with Haedrak. Yusef was defeated, but his life was momentarily spared while Haedrak asked Zaranda what she wanted to do with his life. As the Jhannivvar pretender stabbed Haedrak with a hidden [[dagger]], the Queen of Zazesspur shot him in the eye with an arrow, immediately followed by over a dozen more. The pretender to the throne was dead and the war was came to an end."

        "Aftermath": "The Tethyrian Interregnum was over. Heralds were sent across Faerûn on [[griffon]]-back to announce the return of a noble monarchy to Tethyr along with the royal wedding of Queen Zaranda Star Rhindaun and King-Consort Haedrak Rhindaun. Although many in Tethyr initially believed this was a wedding of political convenience, the two had fallen madly in love with one another. which would continue into the 15{{th}} century DR."
