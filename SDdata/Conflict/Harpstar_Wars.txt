The '''Harpstar Wars''' were a series of conflicts between the [[Harpers]] and the [[malaugrym]] in the late 12{{th}} and early 13{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==History==
The seeds of the conflict were planted with the rediscovery of the malaugrym in the {{YearlinkName|1179}}. 

The war began in earnest in the {{YearlinkName|1182}}, after Elminster created a [[magic item]] called the ''[[Harp of Stars]]'', tricked the malaugrym into stealing it, and then sent the Harpers to get it back. Among the many properties of the ''Harp of Stars'', it could record the memories of malaugrym who used it, thus if it could reveal a great deal about the shapeshifters plans and society. However, the ''Harp of Stars'' was lost or destroyed at the conclusion of the war. 

They continued until the {{YearlinkName|1222}}, when Khelben claimed control over the mind of the malaugrym leader, the [[Shadowmaster]], and compelled the malaugrym to disengage from the [[Material Plane]]. By this time, only a handful of the most powerful malaugryms had survived, and only about twenty Harpers remained. 

When the Harper veterans of the war came back to [[Faer√ªn]], they found the Harpers under the influence of the [[lich]] [[Thavverdasz]], the self-styled Harper King, and fighting with the [[Cult of the Dragon]]. In the last battles, Thavverdasz was destroyed by the [[Zulkir]] of [[Thay]], [[Szass Tam]]. Szass Tam was subsequently defeated by [[Elminster]], and the Harpers now found themselves opposed to Thay.

===Aftermath===
[[Clan Malaug]] made use of information gained in the war to assault the [[drow]] city of [[Chaulssin]] in the {{YearlinkName|1241}}.
