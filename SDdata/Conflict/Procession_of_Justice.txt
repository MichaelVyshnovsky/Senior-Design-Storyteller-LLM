The '''Procession of Justice''' was a campaign to pacify the remnants of the fallen empire of [[Jhaamdath]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the mid–3{{rd}} century [[DR]]. In it, the [[god]] [[Tyr]] himself appeared on [[Toril]], allied with [[Ilmater]], and led a [[celestial]] host against the chaotic and evil forces arrayed in the remains of the fallen empire.

==History==
===Background===
In the final years of the empire of [[Jhaamdath]], in the [[-269 DR|Year of Mournful Monuments, −269 DR]], the bloodthirsty Exarch [[Thelasand IV]] rose to prominence as a trusted advisor to Emperor [[Dharien]], alongside the appearance of the lesser deity of anarchy, [[Valigan Thirdborn]]. Favored by Valigan, Thelasand spurred Jhaamdath into increased conflict with the [[elves]] of [[Nikerymath]]. This culminated in the elven [[Elven high mage|High Mages]] raising an enormous tsunami that wiped out the empire in the [[-255 DR|Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR]], and reshaped the coastline into the Vilhon Reach.

Afterward, the remnants of Jhaamdath fell into lawlessness and banditry.

| text   = I am the planetar Antonia of Hjördis, known to mortals as Resounding Justice and I bring good tidings to you, Thelasand, fourth of that name. Grimjaws is nigh! In the name
of Tyr, this land shall be cleansed of wickedness and anarchy. The seed of Valigan Thirdborn shall be extinguished. Those with evil in your hearts beware—Tyr's justice is both merciful and swift.

In the [[-247 DR|Year of the Striking Lance, −247 DR]], Tyr, god of justice and war, emerged from a ''[[portal]]'' near what would later be [[Alaghôn]] in [[Turmish]] in command of an army of two hundred [[celestial archon]]s.

In a highly targeted campaign, Tyr's host crossed the Vilhon Reach into the remnants of Jhaamdath. In the ensuing battle, Valigan Thirdborn was slain by Tyr's divine host. The celestials later hunted for Thelasand himself, who was in hiding.

Drawn by Tyr's deeds and sacrifices, the older, previously obscure god Ilmater allied himself with Tyr in the [[-243 DR|Year of the Rack, −243 DR]].

The Procession of Justice ended in the [[-238 DR|Year of Fortunes Fair, −238 DR]], with much of Tyr's forces banished back to the [[planes]] or slain outright and the god taking an interest in wider [[Toril]] at the expense of the campaign.
