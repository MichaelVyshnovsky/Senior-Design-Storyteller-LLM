        "mainbody": "The '''Roar of Shadows''' was a titanic conflict between the [[avatar]]s of [[Nobanion]], the King of [[Lion]]s, and [[Malar]], the Beastlord, during the [[Time of Troubles]].",
        "Location": "This battle occurred within the [[Gulthmere Forest]] of the [[Vilhon Reach]].",
        "History": "When gods were forced to walk on [[Toril]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the avatar of Malar invaded the Gulthmere Forestâ€”the territory guarded by the Lion God, the avatar of Nobanion. Malar's plan of slaughtering [[druid]]s of the forest was foiled by the lion deity, and the two clashed in a rancorous battle named the Roar of Shadows. The battle was joined by ranking members of the [[Emerald Enclave]], aiding Nobanion, and in the end, Malar was pushed out of the forest and driven north.\n\nNobanion secured the forest as the seat of his power on [[Toril]], eventually opening a permanent portal to the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]]."
