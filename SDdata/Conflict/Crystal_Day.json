        "mainbody": "'''Crystal Day''' was the name given to a battle fought between the forces of [[Tabot]] and [[Shou Lung]] in Shou Year 894. It was named such for the use of the fabled [[crystalline warriors]] and thereafter celebrated as a holy day.",
        "History": "Tabot was periodically invaded by the forces of Shou Lung, with attempts in {{YearlinkConvert|837|SY}}, in {{YearlinkConvert|859|SY}}, and finally in {{YearlinkConvert|894|SY}}. In this last invasion, the Shou seized the whole of northern Tabot, from [[Lokar Pass]] to [[Ko'Chung Gompa]].\n\nWith the fate of their nation hanging in the balance, artisans in [[Ji]] fashioned the five crystalline warriors and a group of great [[dang-ki]] and [[wu jen]] animated them and gave them magical abilities. On the third day of the fifth month, the ragged defenders of Tabot and their five crystalline warriors confronted the Shou Lung army as they marched out of Lokar Pass. Though the battle was terrific, they were victorious, and went on to reclaim all of the conquered lands.\n\nAfterward, the crystalline warriors went into the mountains to await the day when Tabot again had need of them. The date of the battle would thereafter be considered holy and celebrated in the [[monasteries]] as Crystal Day."
