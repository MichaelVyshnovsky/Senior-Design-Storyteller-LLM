The '''Battle of Demarch's Fall''' was a battle fought in the [[Halls of Demarch]] beneath the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]] between rival factions of [[Demarch's Alliance]], an alliance between [[beguiler]]s who served [[Leira]] and those who served [[Mask]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Beguilers and Dragon Shamans|}}{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Shadowcasters|}}

==Events==
After Mask betrayed Leira in the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], the alliance was broken and the two factions fought a massive battle in their former headquarters, the Halls of Demarch.

The rival beguilers fought a number of bloody skirmishes through the tunnels of the subterranean complex, all concealed in mists. An enormous amount of [[magic]] was cast, resulting in the opening of a rift to the [[Plane of Shadow]]. [[Shadow]]s and various other monsters fell out of the rift, along with several [[magic item]]s and the ''[[tome of Suelivain]]''. The Maskarran and Leiran beguilers slaughtered each other.

===Aftermath===
The survivors fled across [[Faer√ªn]], living in fear of revenge attacks and church agents seeking to learn or maintain their secrets, most never coming back. A few friendly ex-members, however, returned to the Halls of Demarch and reformed into the [[Demarch's Folly]] organization.

The Halls of Demarch, however, were left permanently filled with fog and haunted by [[undead]], shadows, and other monsters.
