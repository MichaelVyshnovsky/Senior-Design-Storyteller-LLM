The '''War of the Silver Marches''' was a conflict between the [[orc]]s of [[Many-Arrows]] that took place in the [[Silver Marches]] over [[1484 DR]] to [[1485 DR]].

==History==
In order to prepare for the war, the [[drow]] [[wizard]] [[Tsabrak Xorlarrin]] channeled the [[Darkening]] upon the Silver Marches under the orders of [[Lolth]].

Soon, in the fall of {{YearlinkName|1484}}, the drow minions of [[Quenthel Baenre]] incited the [[frost giant]]s of the [[Shining White]] and two [[white dragon]]s, [[Arauthator]] and [[Aurbangras]], to ally with the [[orc]]s of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows, where the warmonger [[Hartusk]] gained the power. Thus, a large army of orcs and drow, supported by frost giants and white dragons, assaulted the Silver Marches in the War of the Silver Marches.

[[Nesmé]] was destroyed by an orc horde led by [[Tiago Baenre]] riding the white dragon Arauthator were besieged.

During the [[Battle of the Cold Vale]], [[Bromm]], one of the twin kings of Citadel Adbar, was tricked by the [[half-drow]] [[Doum'wielle Armgo]] and beheaded by Hartusk.

At last, in the spring of the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, Bruenor managed to unite all the dwarven forces to retake the [[River Surbrin]] bridge from the forces of Many-Arrows. In the sky above the battle, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Afafrenfere]] on the [[copper dragon]]s [[Ilnezhara]] and [[Tazmikella]] confronted Tiago Baenre and [[Tos'un Armgo]] on the white dragons Arauthator and Aurbangras, leaving Tos'un and Aurbangras dead and Arauthator in retreat.

In the summer of that year, Bruenor used the dwarven [[Ritual of the March]] and on [[Flamerule 1]] managed to conquer [[Dark Arrow Keep]], restoring it to [[Lorgru]], its proper ruler, and defeating Hartusk's remaining armies. Meanwhile, with the backing of [[Jarlaxle]], using Drizzt as a conduit, the turncoat drow [[archmage]] [[Gromph Baenre]] dispelled the Darkening, disguising the act as the power of [[Mielikki]]. The surviving orcs were forced into retreat, and the war was considered over.

Despite this, resurgent orcs returned to threaten the Silver Marches once more,Although ''Vengeance of the Iron Dwarf'' finishes on Flamerule 1, 1485 DR, and ''Storm King's Thunder'' p. 68 states it ends in 1485 DR, the earlier ''Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide'' p. 17 has the conflict continue into 1486 DR. It is not necessarily a contradiction, as the epilogue of ''Vengeance'' warns of a possible orc return under a lesser leader, hence the conflict continuing in SCAG. This is presumed in this article. Alternatively, SKT was published a year later and may simply supersede SCAG's version of events.
