The '''Gralhund Villa Bloodbath''' was the name given by [[Waterdeep|Waterdhavian]] newspapers to an attack on [[Gralhund Villa]] by members of the [[Zhentarim]] in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.{{Waterdeep-time}}

==Location==
The attack took place in Gralhund Villa, located between [[Saerdoun Street]] and [[Horn Street]] in the [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]].

==History==
===Causes===
House [[Gralhund]] and the Zhentarim maintained a tenuous alliance to achieve their common goal of accessing a treasure of [[Dragon (coin)|dragon]]s, which was accumulated by [[Dagult Neverember]] and left behind in the [[Vault of Dragons]] after he was ousted as the city's [[Open Lord]]. The Gralhunds provided a group of Zhents led by [[Urstul Floxin]] with shelter and money in exchange for a share of the treasure.

The attack was a result of rising tensions between Urstul and [[Yalah Gralhund]] over which course of action to pursue regarding the ''[[Stone of Golorr]]'', the key to the vault's location. While Urstul, who was in possession of the stone at the time, wished to confer with [[Manshoon]] before handing it over to the Gralhunds, Yalah grew tired of having him as a middle man, and decided to take the stone by force and lock Urstul in his quarters. Her goal was to use the stone directly to pursue her objectives.

===Battle===
Urstul, still injured by a ''[[fireball]]'' detonated by the rogue [[nimblewright]] under Yalah's control, rallied his allies in the estate to kill the guards and capture either Yalah or [[Orond Gralhund]] in exchange for the stone. During the confrontation, the nimblewright left the premises, carrying the stone with it.

===Aftermath===
Within minutes of the beginning of hostilities, a [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] patrol arrived at the scene, led by [[Generic City Watch sergeant (Waterdeep)|sergeant]] [[Saeth Cromley]] and [[Barnibus Blastwind]] of the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]], and accompanied by a detachment of [[Griffon Cavalry]] riders for air support. The patrol thoroughly investigated the site and took witness accounts of all neighbors and bystanders, while also making arrests.

The attack on Gralhund Villa had several unfavorable repercussions for the Zhentarim. Following the event, there was a crackdown on the organization by the City Watch, who arrested and interrogated any known members, regardless of whether or not they had been involved with the incident. This forced many members, such as [[Istrid Horn]], to hide and lay low for several days. In addition, the unflattering way in which local broadsheets portrayed the event damaged even more the group's already problematic reputation.

==Combatants==
===Casualties===
Both the Zhentarim forces and the Gralhund household suffered heavy casualties, including three servants who had not been directly involved with the battle.
