        "mainbody": "he War of the Silver Marches was a conflict between the orcs of Many-Arrows that took place in the Silver Marches over 1484 DR to 1485 DR.\nIn order to prepare for the war, the drow wizard Tsabrak Xorlarrin channeled the Darkening upon the Silver Marches under the orders of Lolth.\nSoon, in the fall of , the drow minions of Quenthel Baenre incited the frost giants of the Shining White and two white dragons, Arauthator and Aurbangras, to ally with the orcs of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows, where the warmonger Hartusk gained the power. Thus, a large army of orcs and drow, supported by frost giants and white dragons, assaulted the Silver Marches in the War of the Silver Marches.\nNesm√© was destroyed by an orc horde led by Tiago Baenre riding the white dragon Arauthator were besieged.\nDuring the Battle of the Cold Vale, Bromm, one of the twin kings of Citadel Adbar, was tricked by the half-drow Doumwielle Armgo and beheaded by Hartusk.\nAt last, in the spring of the , Bruenor managed to unite all the dwarven forces to retake the River Surbrin bridge from the forces of Many-Arrows. In the sky above the battle, Drizzt DoUrden and Afafrenfere on the copper dragons Ilnezhara and Tazmikella confronted Tiago Baenre and Tosun Armgo on the white dragons Arauthator and Aurbangras, leaving Tosun and Aurbangras dead and Arauthator in retreat.\nIn the summer of that year, Bruenor used the dwarven Ritual of the March and on Flamerule 1 managed to conquer Dark Arrow Keep, restoring it to Lorgru, its proper ruler, and defeating Hartusks remaining armies. Meanwhile, with the backing of Jarlaxle, using Drizzt as a conduit, the turncoat drow archmage Gromph Baenre dispelled the Darkening, disguising the act as the power of Mielikki. The surviving orcs were forced into retreat, and the war was considered over.\nDespite this, resurgent orcs returned to threaten the Silver Marches once more,Although Vengeance of the Iron Dwarf finishes on Flamerule 1, 1485 DR, and Storm Kings Thunder p. 68 states it ends in 1485 DR, the earlier Sword Coast Adventurers Guide p. 17 has the conflict continue into 1486 DR. It is not necessarily a contradiction, as the epilogue of Vengeance warns of a possible orc return under a lesser leader, hence the conflict continuing in SCAG. This is presumed in this article. Alternatively, SKT was published a year later and may simply supersede SCAGs version of events."
