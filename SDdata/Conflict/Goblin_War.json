        "mainbody": "The '''Goblin War''' was a conflict fought in [[Cormyr]] in [[1371 DR]]. The war started when [[Nalavarauthatoryl]], the Devil Dragon, massed an army of [[orc]]s, [[Grodd goblin]]s, the seven [[ghazneths]], and other monsters to attack the kingdom. It led to the deaths of King [[Azoun IV]] and Princess [[Tanalasta Obarskyr]] and beginning of the Steel Regency of [[Alusair Obarskyr]] on behalf of the infant King [[Azoun Obarskyr V]].{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|22}}",
        "History": {
            "Causes": "In the 1{{st}} century [[DR]], [[Thatoryl Elian]], an [[elf]] hunter of the [[Wolf Woods]], was murdered by [[Andar Obarskyr]]; he was the first elf in the region ever murdered by [[human]] hands. Thatoryl's betrothed, an elf-dragon known then as Lorelei Alavara, persuaded [[Iliphar Nelnueve]], [[Lord of Scepters]], to help her take revenge against human settlers. Despite earning Iliphar's respect and alliance when he and Andar's brother [[Ondeth Obarskyr|Ondeth]] first met, around 1000 humans were killed by elven hands before the elves grew tired of Lorelei's warmongering and, over a century since Elian's death, banished her to the [[Stonelands]]. However, she maintained her quest for vengeance on the [[Obarskyr]] name and all humans in Cormyr.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|116}}, a group of five Cormyrean wizards cast binding spells, specifically keyed to the elf-dragon, and imprisoned her in the [[Grodd]] demiplane. In the casting, two of the wizards gave their lives to empower the final words of the spell. In the process, several of Nalavara's companions were also cast into a [[Hoard (demiplane)|parallel dimension]].\n\nCenturies of suffering, imprisonment, and grief only enhanced her hatred for the realm of Cormyr. In her time, Nalavara, as she was now known,  searched for a means of escape and raised the Grodd goblins to an advanced and militant society. When Cormyr's Royal Wizard [[Vangerdahast]] became temporarily trapped in Grodd in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, she used his magic to power her escape, opening ''[[gate]]s'' back to the [[Prime Material plane]], She also created the ghazneths, long-dead traitors to the realm resurrected and transformed into winged monsters through dark magic.",
            "Battles": "First, the [[red dragon]] Nalavarauthatoryl sent orcs and the Grodd goblins through the ''gates'' to assault the kingdom, in greater numbers than Cormyr had suffered in centuries. She also sent the ghazneths. They were to prepare the way for her own return.\n\nThe Cormyreans, led by King Azoun V and Steel Princess Alusair, fought to defend the realm suffered many defeats. However, the Royal Magician [[Vangerdahast]] was still missing. Worse, some nobles defied Crown Princess Tanalasta or committed treason, showing they'd had more loyalty to Azoun than the Crown. Meanwhile, the victorious goblins raised fortifications in the north.\n\nMany settlements in the Storm Horns were evacuated. In [[Eveningstar]], around a dozen of the fifty or so buildings ruined in ghazneth and goblin attacks, but the town held out. At one point, the city of [[Arabel]] was besieged and its people were occupied before the goblins seized it.\n\nFinally, Nalavarauthatoryl herself entered the fray, being sighted in the skies with the ghazneths.\n\nUltimately, King Azoun IV and Nalavara faced each other in battle. Azoun slew the dragon and was victorious, but at great cost, for he later died of his wounds.\n\nMeanwhile, Crown Princess Tanalasta vanquished the ghazneths, but she too perished soon after, dying in childbirth as she brought Azoun V into the world.",
            "Legacy": "Azoun IV was succeeded by the infant king Azoun V and Alusair reigned as regent.\n\nThe conflict had laid waste to much of Cormyr. As late as [[Flamerule]] of {{yearlink|1372}}, many Arabellans remained displaced and impoverished by the war. Some inhabited Pauper's Town outside Arabel, where onetime farmers and craftsmen subsisted as beggars. Goods such as [[wine]] were also in short supply in Arabel. By autumn of {{yearlink|1374}}, many of these refugees had resettled in [[Wheloon]], rapidly building up the eastern bank.<ref>"
