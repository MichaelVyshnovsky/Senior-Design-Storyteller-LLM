The '''War of the Zulkirs''' was a civil war in [[Thay]] that took place from [[1375 DR]] to [[1385 DR]],<ref> between the self-proclaimed regent of [[Thay]], the [[lich]] [[Szass Tam]], and the combined forces of the other [[zulkir]]s: [[Lallara Mediocros]], [[Nevron]], [[Yaphyll]], [[Lauzoril]], [[Kumed Hahpret]], [[Mythrellan]], and [[Samas Kul]] under the guidance of [[Dmitra Flass]].

==Participants==
===Szass Tam and the Undead===
The necromancer and lich, Szass Tam, and his armies, consisting of loyal [[Red Wizards]] from the [[Necromancy|necromantic]] order and uncountable [[undead]] minions.

===The Council of Zulkirs===
Lallara Mediocros, Nevron, Yaphyll, Lauzoril, Kumed Hahpret, Mythrellan and Samas Kul under the guidance of Dmitra Flass, along with representatives of the Church of [[Kossuth]] and armies led by [[Nymia Focar]].

==The War==
===The Beginnings===
In the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Szass Tam caused the murders of the zulkirs [[Druxus Rhym]] and [[Aznar Thrul]] and betrayed a Thayan army under the command of tharchions [[Azhir Kren]] and [[Homen Odesseiron]] to the [[Rashemen|Rashemi]] to create a climate of fear within the Thayan population. He further hindered proper investigation of the murders to solve these issues by himself. Szass thus tried to convince the nobles, legions and common people that he was the only one able to deal with these problems, in order to get himself elected supreme ruler of Thay.

His former ally Dmitra Flass discerned Szass Tam's plan and rallied the zulkirs originally loyal to the lich to stand against his aspirations.  Szass then chose to achieve rulership by force and declared war on all opposing zulkirs.

===The Progress of War=== 
When Dmitra's council achieved a great victory against Szass Tam's undead army at the [[Keep of Thazar]], Szass called upon the united armies of [[Gauros]] and [[Surthay]] to march south towards the great city of [[Bezantur]]. 

By [[1377 DR]], Szass had established his seat of power at [[Thaymount]] by evicting his enemies from their estates on the plateau.

Over the ten years of warfare, some of the zulkirs changed sides a couple times and became Szass Tam's allies, such as the diviner [[Yaphyll]] who ended up as prisoner of Szass in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, and died during a divination performed for Szass Tam. As Yaphyll predicted, the fight at the [[Keep of Sorrows]] turned in Szass Tam's favor. But then the [[Spellplague]] struck and rendered Szass Tam's magical powers useless, forcing him to flee from the scene with his ally [[Xingax]].

By revealing to [[Malark Springhill]], Dmitra's former trusted ally, why he killed [[Druxus Rhym]], the lich convinced the spymaster to switch sides and work for him and his greater cause henceforth.

In order to learn more about the ways of magic in the time of the Spellplague, Szass summoned [[Bane]] and made a bargain with the evil [[god]]: Bane would reveal to Szass his knowledge about the chaotic magic, grant the lich the ability to raise more dead for his cause, and augment the lich's powers. Szass in turn would surrender his soul after 1000 years had passed when his quest of conquering Thay was completed. When it came to another fight at the Keep of Sorrows, Szass used his god-bestowed powers and summoned a [[dream vestige]] to turn the tide in his favor.

Tam succeeded in beating the legions of the zulkirs, chasing them all the way to [[Bezantur]] and even out of the town itself, forcing the zulkirs to flee aboard vessels. Szass followed the fleeing zulkirs, entangling them in a marine war between his enemies and Nevron's conjured denizens of the infernal oceans and the lich's own undead aquatic minions. When the zulkirs seemed to gain the upper hand, Szass conjured the dream vestige again, finally exhausting his magical powers bestowed by Bane. The [[bard]] [[Bareris Anskuld]] defeated the dream vestige and the zulkir's forces beat Szass Tam's minions, forcing the lich and Malark to withdraw to the Thaymount. Szass didn't bother chasing the remaining zulkirs any more, leaving [[Aloar]] and the [[Wizards' Reach]] to them as he did not fear any retribution by the depleted zulkir's forces. In any case, the continuing Spellplague effectively ended the civil war.
