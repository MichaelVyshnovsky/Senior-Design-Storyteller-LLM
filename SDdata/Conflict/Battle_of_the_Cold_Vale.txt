The Battle of the Cold Vale was fought between the orcs of Many-Arrows and the Silver Marches, represented by Citadel Adbar, in the .
The dwarves of Adbar had been tricked off-course by Doumwielle Armgo, and led into springing this trap. The orcs used ambush tactics, luring the dwarven army to commit before revealing their main forceâ€”one including frost giants and the white dragon Arauthator, ridden by Tiago Baenre. The dwarven host was quickly obliterated, with King Bromm captured and executed by Hartusk. Oretheo Spikes of the Wilddwarf Brigade, having been bested by Tiago, was stripped naked and sent back to Adbar to warn of the orcs coming.
