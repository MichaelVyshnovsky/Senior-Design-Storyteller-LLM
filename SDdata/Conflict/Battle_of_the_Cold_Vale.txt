|He worked his serrated long knife savagely, tearing out the king's throat to the howls of approval from his legions. The ferocious orc didn't stop there, digging and ripping the blade back and forth unrelentingly until he took the head of the dwarf king's shoulders.

==History==
The [[dwarves]] of Adbar had been tricked off-course by [[Doum'wielle Armgo]], and led into springing this trap. The orcs used ambush tactics, luring the dwarven army to commit before revealing their main forceâ€”one including [[frost giant]]s and the [[white dragon]] [[Arauthator]], ridden by [[Tiago Baenre]]. The dwarven host was quickly obliterated, with King [[Bromm]] captured and executed by [[Hartusk]]. [[Oretheo Spikes]] of the [[Wilddwarf Brigade]], having been bested by Tiago, was stripped naked and sent back to Adbar to warn of the orcs' coming.
