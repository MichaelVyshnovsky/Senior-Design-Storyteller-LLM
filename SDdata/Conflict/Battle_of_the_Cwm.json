        "mainbody": "The Battle of the Cwm took place in the early hours of Ches 27, the ,\nLed by Sarya Dlardrageth, the daemonfey consisted of 1500 feyri, 500 assorted demons and yugoloths (yugoloths, mezzoloths, vrocks, hezrous, babaus, nycaloths) and thousands of orcs, ogres, bugbears, and trolls. Sarya herself did not participate in the battle, nor did her general Mardeiym Reithel. The glabrezu Grushakk fought, however.\nThe elves were led by Seiveril Miritar and consisted of 2000 Evereskan combatants, and 6000 elves from Evermeet, The elves would also summon air elementals. The more notable participants on the elven side were\n* Seiveril Miritar\n* Ilsevele Miritar\n* Fflar Starbrow Melruth\n* Araevin Teshurr\n* Grayth Holmfast (human)\n* Maresa Rost (human/genasi)\n* Jorildyn\n* Jerreda Starcloak\n* Elvath Muirreste\n* Vesilde Gaerth\n* Rhaellen\n* Celeilol Fireheart\n* Haraeth Echorn\n* Geren Festryth\nThe daemonfey army arranged themselves on the west side of the battlefield with the elves on the east, on the higher ground near the Sunset Gate, which provided a tactical advantage to the archers and spellcasters.\nThe battle began with the sounding of horns in the daemonfey ranks, at which point the orcs, ogres, and others charged, while the feyri took to the air. The elves responded with archers, taking down hundreds from the charge, although the ogres were not so easily felled as the orcs, and the trolls could only be killed with acid or fire. Over a hundred elven spellcasters had disguised themselves beneath the cloaks of the archers and swordsmen, and they simultaneously summoned a large number of air elementals, which rose to engage the airborne feyri. It only served as a light distraction, however, since the feyri outnumbered the summoned elementals tenfold.\nDuring the battle, Araevin cast a flying spell upon himself so that he could more easily reach the feyri above, but they soon outnumbered him despite his spellcasting, and one of them dispelled his aerial magic, sending him into a fall and injuring him.\nIn a crucial moment of the battle, a company of demons teleported to Seiverils location and engaged the elven leader. He was aided by Fflar, who used the sword Keryvian to great effect, defeating two hezrous, while Seiveril himself defeated one hezrou and one nycaloth. A glabrezu, likely Grushakk,This is assumed to be Grushakk, though this is not mentioned in the text. engaged with Araevin, Ilsevele, Grayth and Maresa, but was quickly brought down and defeated.\nThe daemonfey armies were forced to retreat soon afterwards.\nAmongst the elves, 500 were killed and another 500 seriously wounded. Notable elven casualties were\n* Celeilol Fireheart\n* Geren Festryth\n* Elvath Muirreste\n* Haraeth Echorn\nThe elves estimated thousands of orcs and ogres dead, as well as \"dozens and dozens\" of fiends destroyed,"
