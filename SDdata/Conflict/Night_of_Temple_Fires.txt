The '''Night of Temple Fires''' was a conflict that occurred in [[Waterdeep]] in [[1345 DR]]. 

Following a period of unrest between followers of the churches of [[Lathander]], [[Sel√ªne]], [[Shar]], and [[Tempus]], one night of violence and looting resulted in the destruction of the [[Spires of the Morning]] and the [[House of Heroes]], and the sacking of a subterranean temple of Shar near [[Shadows Alley]].

The [[Dark Army of the Night]] tried, but failed to set fire to the [[House of the Moon]].
