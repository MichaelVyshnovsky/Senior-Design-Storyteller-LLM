        "mainbody": "The Rage of Wizards was a conflict between two dozen ambitious archmages of Tashluta and Lapaliiya, who fought the yuan-ti of the Coiled Cabal in .\nWhen the Coiled Cabal mages woke up in  after a centuries-long sleep, they tried to take Sammaresh, before reconquering the rest of the Cities of the Seabreeze. Their actions drove two dozen scheming mages of Tashluta and Lapaliiya into action, however, and the two factions fought for a season, leaving a trail of destruction across the Tashtan coast.\nNeither the yuan-ti nor the archmages gained a single throne, in spite of the extensive destruction. As a consequence of the conflict and the destruction, mages were viewed with suspicion throughout Lapaliiya, while civic faiths were created. The city of Procalith was completely destroyed by a sorcerously-driven storm during the fight, and never rebuilt."
