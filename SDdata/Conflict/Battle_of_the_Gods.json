When the orcs invaded Mulhorand and Unther, the gods of those nations also sent their avatars to the lands that later would become Thay, to face the invaders gods, resulting in what was later known as the Battle of the Gods.\nIll-prepared to defend themselves against the orc gods, however, the gods of Mulhorand and Unther were slaughtered. Re was the first to fall, slain by Gruumsh, Ki and Utu were later killed by the orc deities as well. Tiamat, who was also the enemy of the other Untheric gods, saw an opportunity to slay Gilgeam while he was battling Ilneval. However, Marduk (Bahamuts Untheric aspect) intercepted her before she could act and in the ensuing battle they killed each other in one of the climactic battles of the Dragonfall War.\nDespite their initial advantage, the orcs and their deities were eventually defeated by the survivors of the Mulhorandi and Untheric pantheons in the final Orcgate war, that took place in .\nGilgeam became the remaining god-king of Unther. In time, he became more and more tyrannical,"
