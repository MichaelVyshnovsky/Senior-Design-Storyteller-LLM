        "History": "During the Orcgate Wars, the [[gray orc]]s and their [[cleric]]s had developed amazingly powerful and deadly [[spell]]s; the most potent of [[magic]]s being their ability to directly call down [[avatar]]s of their [[deities]]. When the orcs invaded [[Mulhorand]] and [[Unther]], the gods of those nations also sent their avatars to the lands that later would become [[Thay]], to face the invaders' gods, resulting in what was later known as the Battle of the Gods.\n\nIll-prepared to defend themselves against the [[orc]] gods, however, the gods of Mulhorand and Unther were slaughtered. [[Re]] was the first to fall, slain by [[Gruumsh]], [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]] and [[Utu]] were later killed by the orc deities as well. [[Tiamat]], who was also the enemy of the other Untheric gods, saw an opportunity to slay [[Gilgeam]] while he was battling Ilneval. However, [[Marduk]] ([[Bahamut]]'s Untheric aspect) intercepted her before she could act and in the ensuing battle they killed each other in one of the climactic battles of the Dragonfall War.",
        "Aftermath": "Despite their initial advantage, the orcs and their deities were eventually defeated by the survivors of the Mulhorandi and Untheric pantheons in the final Orcgate war, that took place in {{Yearlink|-1069}}.\n\nGilgeam became the remaining god-king of Unther. In time, he became more and more tyrannical,"
