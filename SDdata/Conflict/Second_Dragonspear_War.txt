The '''Second Dragonspear War''' was a series of conflicts that took place in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, between the rampaging [[Hordes of Dragonspear (army)|Hordes of Dragonspear]] and several armies united in defense. Included among the defenders were the combined forces of several [[Lords' Alliance]] powers, [[elves]] from the [[Misty Forest]] and [[Laughing Hollow]], as well as the [[dwarves]] of [[Clan Stonehand]],{{Cite web/Siege of Dragonspear: Field Report}} and those from [[Illefarn]].

==Location==
The war took place in the [[Western Heartlands]] and along the [[Sword Coast]]. Some battlegrounds included lands around the [[The Way Inn]], the town of [[Daggerford]], and the source of fiendish army, [[Dragonspear Castle]].

==History==
===Causes===
In the years following the [[First Dragonspear War]], several [[baatezu]] from [[Avernus]] discovered the ''[[portal|gate]]'' that connected the [[Nine Hells]] to the [[material plane]] at the heart of Dragonspear Castle. While at first only a few devils passed through the portal in secret, others soon followed until they claimed the castle as their own. They came to be led by the malevolent [[pit fiend]] [[Baazka]].

===Initial Conflicts===
The first belligerent actions of the war were a series of raids on the Misty Forest, made by the [[Marauders]] of the Dragonspear army. A contingent of [[goblin]]s and [[kobold]]s rampaged through the forest, but were turned away by the [[elves]] and [[druid]]s that lived within.

The Marauders returned a few weeks later, accompanied by [[bugbear]]s and [[ogre]]s of [[The Storm]]. The elves and druids were able to turn the invaders and their victory was close at hand. Unfortunately, the [[dragon aging|ancient]] [[black dragon]] [[Maelestor Rex]] swooped over the Misty Forest and rained its acid breath over the allied defenders. The elven lines were broken and the horde continued their frenzied assault.

As the fiendish horde ravaged the countryside of the Sword Coast, refugees came pouring in to Daggerford in droves. [[Pwyll Daggerford|Duke Pwyll "Greatshout"]] made a call to arms and rallied the [[Army of Daggerford|town's army]]. The Daggerford army was soon joined by a band of adventurers, and guardsmen from the 3{{rd}} company of Waterdeep's [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|High Guard]], led by [[Frey Silverblade]].

===Battles===
The next major battle took place just outside The Way Inn. The adventurers, Daggerford's militia, and the 3{{rd}} company soldiers were all stationed around the inn, which sat atop a hill The Marauders of the Dragonspear Horde came directly up the road, in a disadvantageous position. The defenders emerged victorious and the [[cornugon]] commander of the Marauders, [[Vrag]], swore revenge. 

A group of [[Uhbrick's Rangers|mercenaries]] led by the [[ranger]] [[Uhmbrick]] vowed to join the cause, as they considered the Daggerford commander [[Dauravyn Redbeard]] to be a trusted old friend. The allied army and their new companions remained at the inn while the adventuring party left to scout the decimated Misty Forest.

While the army left a small detachment behind, the majority of their forces moved south shortly thereafter. Their numbers were bolstered by the elves led by [[Sylyndyrryl Moonspinner]], along with the dwarves that fought under [[Cyrag Hammerbone]]. Not long after the army left, The Way Inn was destroyed by the hordes' black dragon.

Following the destruction of the inn, the Hordes of Dragonspear assaulted the town of Daggerford.

Following the battle, [[the Army Banner of Daggerford]] militia was lost as the defenders were forced to retreat back behind Daggerford city walls. The orcs and devils dragged the banner back into [[Dragonspear Castle]], reveling in a battle's victory. The Army Banner was proudly erected on top of the tallest spire of the castle as a war trophy. With the enemy stronghold being perceived as impregnable, the Daggerford militia's morale plummeted. The Duke knew that demoralization was sure to result in a crushing defeat, and recovering the banner was essential to survival. However impossible the task seemed, one soldier, [[Kaylet Wespil]], volunteered for the suicide mission. With Duke's permission, the woman rode to her cottage a few miles away from Daggerford and retrieved a small lockbox left to her by her heroic father. Later the same day, Kaylet Wespil returned to the Duke's tent, carrying the Army Banner of Daggerford. The woman cashed a favor in from a [[bronze dragon]] ally of her father. On the wyrm's back, she flew over the castle and snatched the banner without the enemy's notice. The Duke commissioned the dragon's aid with the ensuing battles, and the militia morale was high once again.

The final battle of the war took place in the wooded fields outside Dragonspear Castle, with the entirety of both forces present. While the allied forces were greatly outnumbered by the horde, the adventuring party that accompanied them managed to turn the tide of battle. Having previously acquired the ''[[dragonspear]]'' in the subterranean labyrinth beneath the castle, they presented it to Maelestor Rex. Knowing that the weapon's destruction meant he could regain his free will, the dragon unleashed its acidic breath on the spear and turned on his fiendish oppressors.

Once they routed the horde of devils and monsters, allied forces eradicated the last remaining fiends from within the castle itself. After nearly two years of fighting, the Second Dragonspear War was at an end.

===Aftermath===
After the Horde army was broken and the evil forces of Dragonspear Castle were stopped, [[Priest]]s of the god [[Tempus]] constructed a shrine within the castle, like the ruined [[Hold of the Battle Lions]] temple built after the first war. The shrine remained a bulwark against the forces of the Nine Hells well into the 15{{th}} century.<ref group="note">The [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|FRCS 3e]] states this happened "a decade ago" from [[1372 DR]]. Presumably this refers to an event after the second war, which took place [[1363 DR]], rather than one sixteen years prior in [[1356 DR]].

The Way Inn was rebuilt over the course of the following year.

Overall, the conflict strengthened the relationship between Daggerford and Waterdeep, two powers united under the [[Lords' Alliance]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, [[Caelar Argent]] led the [[Shining Crusade]] under the false promise of freeing the souls of those who had died during the Second Dragonspear War.

===Combatants===
The Hordes of Dragonspear, led by the [[pit fiend]] [[Baazka]], comprised three distinct contingents. The Marauders of Vrag numbered nearly a thousand goblins and kobolds that engaged in suicidal raids, the [[Blood Guard]] had half their number of [[orc]]s and [[hobgoblin]]s in what was the main assault force, and [[The Storm]] was a couple hundred [[bugbear]]s and [[ogre]]s that fought under cover of the black dragon, Maelestor Rex.

;Notable Individual Combatants:
* [[Baergon Bluesword]], a [[cleric]] of [[Tempus]] that helped defend during the Battle of Daggerford
* [[The Barghest]], a ruthless [[half-orc]] that had previously fought in the first war
* [[Kaylet Wespil]], a militia woman of Daggerford who recovered the Army Banner of Daggerford and enlisted help of a fierce bronze dragon who aided against the forces of Dragonspear.
