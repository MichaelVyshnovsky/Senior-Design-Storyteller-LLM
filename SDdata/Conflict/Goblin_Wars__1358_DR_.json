        "mainbody": "The Goblin Wars were a series of conflicts fought in the kingdom of Erlkazar against invading goblins in 1358 DR.\nEarly in the , King Ertyk Uhl of the Starrock tribe led a horde of goblins down from the High Peaks and the Kuldin Peaks to invade Erlkazar, then under the rule of King Valon Morkann. For over three months, the goblins laid siege to the city of Duhlnarim. The goblins numbers appeared limitless and many heroes and Duhlnarims mages failed to stop them.\nFinally, however, Elestams Crusaders forged an alliance with the Shieldbreakers, a reliable ogre mercenary force from Rivenshield. The war turned and the goblins were cut down to under a third of their number. After almost a full year of fighting, the conflict ended before the close of the year.\nDuring the conflict, a brewer of Llorbauth, Araneth Idogyr, met and befriended a cyclops, from whom he acquired the recipe for Old One Eye ale.\nErlkazar and the Shieldbreakers maintained their alliance against the High Peaks goblins and giants as of 1367 DR.\nAccording to reports, the goblins had just begun to regain their strength a decade later.\nAmong the casualties was Rysodyl Boughstrong, the elf husband of High Watcher Laxaella Bronshield, Baroness of Tanistan. Rysodyl was killed by King Ertyk Uhl himself."
