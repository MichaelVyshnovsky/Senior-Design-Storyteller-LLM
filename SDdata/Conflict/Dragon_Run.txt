The '''Dragon Run''' of the {{YearlinkName|1306}} leveled the city of [[Phlan]] on the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]].<ref name=GHR>

==History==
During that year, an invasion of [[dragon]]s swept through the [[Moonsea]] region of [[north Faerûn]]. The dragon attack occurred at the same time as a [[human]] conflict in the region between [[Mulmaster]] and an alliance of other cities. Focused on their own struggles, the other powers in the region were unable to send aid to Phlan.<ref name=GHR/>

Phlan was completely destroyed during the attack, forcing the survivors to rebuild anew.
