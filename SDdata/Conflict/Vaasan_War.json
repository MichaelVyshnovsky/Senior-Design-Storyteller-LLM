        "mainbody": "The '''Vaasan War''' was a decade-long conflict between the Kingdom of [[Damara]] and the Kingdom of [[Vaasa]] during the mid 14{{Th}} century [[DR]] in which [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] rose to power and successfully conquered both realms.",
        "Location": "The war began in Vaasa itself with Zhengyi's conquest of the [[Sunderland]] in the south and [[Ostraland]] in the north, but much of the war occurred on Damaran soil and climaxed at the [[Ford of Goliad]]. That said, [[Impiltur]] also felt the effects of the war with Zhengyi owing to the complete disruption of Damaran trade that it caused.",
        "History": {
            "Causes": "[[Zhengyi the Witch-King]] appeared in Vaasa and raised [[Castle Perilous]] in a single night in {{YearlinkName|1347}},<ref group=\"note\">The [[Forgotten Realms]] campaign sets for both the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set|1st edition]] (set [[1357 DR]]) and [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition|2nd edition]] (set [[1368 DR]]) give Zhengyi's appearance as happening \"20 years ago.\" The [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition|3rd edition]] onward continued from the date established in the 2nd edition, and set the year as [[1347 DR]]. thus declaring himself ruler of a new Kingdom of Vaasa. He raised an [[undead]] army and quickly gained allegiance of the land's [[evil]] inhabitants, including the dreaded [[Citadel of Assassins]], and began a war of conquest across Vaasa and Damara.",
            "Battles": "",
            "Aftermath": "With most of Damara's experienced soldiers now dead and its leaders assassinated, the realm was unable to stand against Zhengyi any further. He claimed the northern duchies as his own, He further demanded that the southern baronies pay hefty tribute to his Kingdom of Vaasa, and hand-selected the rulers of most of these realms, sometimes selecting for loyalty but more often selecting for incompetence. The result was in-fighting between the southern rulers and heavy taxes on the people. While this arrangement was often considered a devious decision on his part, ensuring control of the northern regions (where most of Damara's mineral wealth was located) while leaving the southern regions unable to unite against him,\n\nAfter consolidating his control, Zhengyi then turned his attention away from Damara as he plotted to grow his strength. Two years later, the [[Bloodstone Wars]] would erupt in Damara between the squabbling baronies."
        },
        "Combatants": "Zhengyi's army consisted of three main groups. The first were the [[demon]] and [[undead]] forces made available to him through his allegiance to [[Orcus]]. The second were the monstrous [[humanoids]], [[goblinoids]], and [[giants]] of Vaasa, who flocked to him when he first declared his rule over Vaasa. The last group included [[Vaasan]] [[humans]], such as the [[White Worm]] tribe and the [[Citadel of Assassins]]. \n\nKing Virdin's army was comprised of the soldiers and militia of Damara, led by the Damaran nobility, with some very minor support of neighboring realms, namely [[Narfell]] and [[Impiltur]]."
