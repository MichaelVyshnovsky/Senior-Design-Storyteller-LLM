The '''Rage of Wizards''' was a conflict between two dozen ambitious archmages of [[Tashluta]] and [[Lapaliiya]], who fought the [[yuan-ti]] of the [[Coiled Cabal]] in {{yearlink|1142}}.

==Conflict==
When the [[Coiled Cabal]] mages woke up in {{yearlink|1142}} after a centuries-long sleep, they tried to take [[Sammaresh]], before reconquering the rest of the [[Cities of the Seabreeze]]. Their actions drove two dozen scheming mages of [[Tashluta]] and [[Lapaliiya]] into action, however, and the two factions fought for a season, leaving a trail of destruction across the Tashtan coast.

==Aftermath==
Neither the yuan-ti nor the archmages gained a single throne, in spite of the extensive destruction.{{cite book/Serpent Kingdoms|99}} As a consequence of the conflict and the destruction, mages were viewed with suspicion throughout [[Lapaliiya]],{{cite book/Serpent Kingdoms|98}} while civic faiths were created.{{cite book/Serpent Kingdoms|100}} The city of [[Procalith]] was completely destroyed by a sorcerously-driven storm during the fight, and never rebuilt.{{cite book/Serpent Kingdoms|126}}
