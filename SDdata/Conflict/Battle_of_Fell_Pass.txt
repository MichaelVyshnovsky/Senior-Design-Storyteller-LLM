The Battle of Fell Pass took place centuries before the 14th century DR in Fell Pass in the Spine of the World. It was fought between Delzoun dwarves and orcs. As of 1370 DR their ghosts still occupied the pass.
The battle was originally going the orcs way but the dwarves used the many tunnels and caverns of Fell Pass to resupply and heal the wounded.
The dwarves then lured the orcs into a trap by presenting a small group, and waiting for the orcs to charge, at which point the full force of dwarves came out of concealment behind trapdoors and attacked. The battle was won by the dwarves, though at great cost.
