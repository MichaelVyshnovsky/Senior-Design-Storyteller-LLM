'''The Night of Crystal and Iron''' was a decisive battle during the [[Fall of Zhentil Keep]].

One night, in [[Alturiak]], the forces belonging to the delicate alliance between the [[white dragon]]s and [[frost giant]]s in [[Cyric]]'s siege army came together in an all-out offensive against the Keep. Amazingly, the tired and starving [[Zhentilar]] defenders managed to hold their line against the onslaught.
