The '''Murann Spice War''' marked the pinnacle of a 100-years-long feud between the [[Ophal]] and [[Ulvax]] merchant families of [[Amn]].

==History==
===Causes===
A fierce dispute over the rights to the [[Zakharan]] [[spice]] trade in the {{YearlinkName|1238}}, brought the Ophal and Ulvax families into opposition. It was the beginning of a century-long feud including several other incidents.

===Battle===
In the {{YearlinkName|1338}}, the conflict escalated into a small-scale civil war in the city of [[Athkatla]]. Guards and assassins hired by both families fought in the streets, causing the residents to join the battles to support their favorite family. The most important battle of this conflict, which became known as the [[Night of Spiced Spears]], saw the deaths of 400 people, including 150 civilians.

===Aftermath===
In order to stop the bloodshed, the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] took the unprecedented decision to interfere with the business of the involved merchant families. Because their investigations concluded that House Ulvax was responsible for the deadly battle, the council withdrew all their trading rights related to spice business, replacing them with different mercantile activities of similar monetary value. This removed any reason for both families' businesses to interact with each other, thereby ending the conflict.

As a result of the sanction, the influence of House Ulvax dwindled in Athkatla, whereas House Ophal rose in power.
