The Wine Blight Insurrection was a conflict between wine-producing peasant farmers in the Purple Hills and their lord, the Duke of Ankramir, in the summer of the .
A vine-blight struck Faer√ªn in 1252 DR, causing grapes to die and resulting in a shortage of wine. This created hardship for the wine-producing peasants of the Purple Hills in Tethyr, which was exacerbated when the Duke of Ankramir made it known that he expected his usual levy of wine from them. Instead, the destitute peasants ignored him sought to recoup their losses by selling their wine stores to buyers in the North. Incensed, the Duke sent his soldiers to confiscate the wine.
The only notable battle of the Wine Blight Insurrection was the so-called Battle of the Broken Vats, in which the peasants defiantly smashed many of their casks of wine and threw them into the Sea of Swords to prevent the Dukes soldiers from seizing them. In retaliation, the Duke ordered his troops to capture the head of every household in the Purple Hills.
The captured peasants were to be hastily tried for treason by a council of judges and then put to death. However, a priest of Ilmater named Ramedar came to their aid, and eloquently argued that the rebels should be released into the custody of the church of Ilmater. His pleas successfully saved hundreds of lives and cemented his reputation as a saint of his faith, especially once the enraged Duke had him put to death for treason soon after.
