The '''Battle of Bloody Reeds''' was a battle fought in [[Impiltur]] against an [[orc]] horde from [[Vastar]] in [[512 DR|the Year of the Wyvernfall, 512 DR]].

==Events==
===Lead up===
In [[512 DR|the Year of the Wyvernfall, 512 DR]], the orc nation of Vastar was on the rampage again, with orc hordes from here and other strongholds emerging and threatening [[Cormanthyr]] and many other lands with war. 

The orc chieftain [[Ulbror]] marched his horde through many small passes of the [[Earthspur Mountains]] and invaded the uplands of [[Impiltur]] instead. King [[Sharaun Mirandor]] and his three sons led a small army north to meet them and were defeated and slain in battle, killing off the [[Mirandor]] dynasty.

===The battle===
[[Duke]] [[Harandil Durlaven]]—Sharaun's son-in-law—mustered another army and went after the orcs. The horde was routed at the Battle of Bloody Reeds.

===Aftermath===
Harandil was declared king of Impiltur by the acclamation of his followers, and crowned on the battlefield itself. This founded the [[Durlaven]] dynasty.
