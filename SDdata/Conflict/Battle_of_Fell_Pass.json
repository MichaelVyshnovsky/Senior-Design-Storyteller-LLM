        "mainbody": "The '''Battle of Fell Pass''' took place centuries before the 14th century [[DR]] in [[Fell Pass]] in the [[Spine of the World]]. It was fought between [[Delzoun]] [[dwarves]] and [[orc]]s. As of [[1370 DR]] their [[ghost]]s still occupied the pass.",
        "Battle": "The battle was originally going the orcs' way but the dwarves used the many tunnels and caverns of Fell Pass to resupply and heal the wounded.\n\nThe dwarves then lured the orcs into a trap by presenting a small group, and waiting for the orcs to charge, at which point the full force of dwarves came out of concealment behind trapdoors and attacked. The battle was won by the dwarves, though at great cost.",
