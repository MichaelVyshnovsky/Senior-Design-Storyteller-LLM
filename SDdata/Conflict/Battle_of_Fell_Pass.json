        "mainbody": "The Battle of Fell Pass took place centuries before the 14th century DR in Fell Pass in the Spine of the World. It was fought between Delzoun dwarves and orcs. As of 1370 DR their ghosts still occupied the pass.\nThe battle was originally going the orcs way but the dwarves used the many tunnels and caverns of Fell Pass to resupply and heal the wounded.\nThe dwarves then lured the orcs into a trap by presenting a small group, and waiting for the orcs to charge, at which point the full force of dwarves came out of concealment behind trapdoors and attacked. The battle was won by the dwarves, though at great cost.\nFell Pass\nCategoryEvents in the Spine of the World\nCategoryEvents in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryEvents in Faerûn\nCategoryEvents on Toril\ndyzoc8p85rlzsnah0ju6d1lmqihu2ku"
