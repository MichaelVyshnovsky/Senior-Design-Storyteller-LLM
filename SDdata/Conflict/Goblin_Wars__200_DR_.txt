The '''Goblin Wars''' were a series of conflicts fought in the kingdom of [[Cormyr]] against the [[goblin]]s of [[Hlundadim]] around [[200 DR]].

==History==
===Battle===
Directed by the mysterious mage known only as [[Great Hlundadim]], the goblinkin of Hlundadim invaded Cormyr in the {{yearlinkName|198}}. They razed the settlement of Arabel and continued on into the [[King's Forest]]. Battle after battle would follow.

Finally, north of [[Suzail]] in the {{YearlinkName|200}}, King [[Moriann Obarskyr]] led the armies of Cormyr into battle against the Hlundadim goblins. The goblins were defeated and forced into the [[Stonelands]].

===Aftermath===
Victory was a costly one for Cormyr: Moriann's two sons and heirs were killed in the fighting, and the king himself died the [[201 DR|following year]] whilst at a feast celebrating the victory.{{Cite dragon/407/Blades of Kings|30-31}} He was succeeded by his brother, [[Tharyann Obarskyr|Tharyann the Elder]].

The knight [[Varanth]], "Thundersword", a loyal companion of King Moriann, was one of the first deaths of the war, and was followed into the grave by five of his sons. The sixth and surviving son was a popular young knight named [[Rayn]], who claimed inheritance of his father's sword, ''[[Symylazarr]]'', which had been taken up by Moriann during the war and was almost buried with the king. Tharyann, not yet even crowned, agreed so as not to anger the people. A [[tenday]] later, Rayn returned and pledged his fealty to the now King Tharyann, laying ''Symylazarr'' at his feet. The king ennobled Rayn as the first Lord [[Thundersword]], while ''Symylazarr'' was adopted by the Obarskyrs for knighting and oaths of fealty as Moriann had used it during the war.

During the conflict, the [[Alsevir]] family was also raised to the nobility.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|67}}

Hlundadim collapsed under the expansion of the [[Anauroch]] desert in the {{YearlinkName|268}}.
