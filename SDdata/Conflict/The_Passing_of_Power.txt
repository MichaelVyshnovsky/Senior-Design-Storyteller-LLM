'''The Passing of Power''' took place in {{Yearlink|-205}} when the [[elf]] [[Iliphar Nelnueve]] challenged the [[black dragon]] [[Thauglor]] to a [[Feint of Honor]].

Although a Feint of Honor typically took place between two dragons, Iliphar had cause to challenge Thauglor to put a stop to the fighting between the two races. The dragons contested the elves had invaded their long-established territory, while the elves maintained the dragons did not need to prey upon them.

At first, Thauglor saw no benefit in participating in the Feint, but Iliphar pointed out that despite elf deaths far outnumbering dragon deaths, the elves were quicker to reproduce and were many times greater in number. Thauglor accepted the challenge and inflicted heavy injuries upon Iliphar, but Iliphar managed to lodge his magical staff in the mouth of the dragon, the first technical breach of the rules. Unable to free it using normal means, Thauglor used his acid breath to melt away the staff, a technical breach of the Feint's rules, and unwittingly unleashed the magic stored inside the staff, causing his throat to explode, and condemning him to defeat.
