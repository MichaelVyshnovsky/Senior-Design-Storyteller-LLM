Hartkiller eventually forced the giants to leave the valley of Hartsvale, but he was killed by a storm giant at the end of the war.\nAfter the conclusion of the war, a purple misty apparition visited the giants, warning them that they were rejecting Annam All-Fathers will by refusing to comply with Hartkiller, that the humans in Hartsvale survived as a punishment to the giants, and that Annam was destined to return when a new king emerged from Hartsvale to restore the kingdom of Ostoria.\nCategoryWars\nCategoryEvents in Hartsvale\nCategoryEvents in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryEvents in Faerûn\nCategoryEvents on Toril\nhq0m11jqdj32t53ixnqxdpu459wlkfr"
