        "mainbody": "The '''War of the Hart''' (not to be confused with the [[War of the Twins|War of the Harts]]) was a battle that took place between [[Hartkiller]]'s [[human]] and [[giant-kin]] armies and the [[giant]]s.\n\nIt took place many hundreds of years before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Hartkiller eventually forced the giants to leave the valley of [[Hartsvale]], but he was killed by a [[storm giant]] at the end of the war.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the war, a purple misty apparition visited the giants, warning them that they were rejecting [[Annam All-Father]]'s will by refusing to comply with Hartkiller, that the humans in Hartsvale survived as a punishment to the giants, and that Annam was destined to return when a new king emerged from Hartsvale to restore the kingdom of [[Ostoria]].",
