The '''Hin Ghostwar''' (also known as the '''Hin Ghostwars''') was a long conflict between the [[ghostwise halfling]]s and the allied [[Strongheart halfling|strongheart]] and [[lightfoot halfling]]s in the [[Lluirwood]] in [[Luiren]].

==Background==
The three halfling subraces ([[lightfoot halfling]]s, [[strongheart halfling]]s, and [[ghostwise halfling]]s) were originally nomadic tribes of the [[Lluirwood]] in [[Luiren]] who shared their resources among each other.

==Events==
Around {{Yearlink|-100}}, a ghostwise halfling [[cleric]] named [[Desva]] began leading the ghostwise in the worship of [[Malar]] and violence, performing savage acts on the creatures and other halflings of the forest. In {{Yearlink|-68}}, the stronghearts and lightfoots allied against the ghostwise and battle continued for years until [[Chand]] of the stronghearts slew Desva in {{Yearlink|-65}}.

==Results==
Most of the few surviving ghostwise left Luiren for the [[Chondalwood]], making an oath that they wouldn't speak until they had atoned for their savagery. They organized into familiar clans and became more isolated.

Many lightfoots, horrified by the war, chose to leave Luiren and spread across northern [[Faer没n]] and mixing with other races.

The stronghearts remained in the Lluirwood and began building permanent settlements.
