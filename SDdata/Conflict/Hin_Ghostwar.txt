The Hin Ghostwar (also known as the Hin Ghostwars) was a long conflict between the ghostwise halflings and the allied strongheart and lightfoot halflings in the Lluirwood in Luiren.
The three halfling subraces (lightfoot halflings, strongheart halflings, and ghostwise halflings) were originally nomadic tribes of the Lluirwood in Luiren who shared their resources among each other.
Around , a ghostwise halfling cleric named Desva began leading the ghostwise in the worship of Malar and violence, performing savage acts on the creatures and other halflings of the forest. In , the stronghearts and lightfoots allied against the ghostwise and battle continued for years until Chand of the stronghearts slew Desva in .
Most of the few surviving ghostwise left Luiren for the Chondalwood, making an oath that they wouldnt speak until they had atoned for their savagery. They organized into familiar clans and became more isolated.
Many lightfoots, horrified by the war, chose to leave Luiren and spread across northern Faer没n and mixing with other races.
The stronghearts remained in the Lluirwood and began building permanent settlements.
