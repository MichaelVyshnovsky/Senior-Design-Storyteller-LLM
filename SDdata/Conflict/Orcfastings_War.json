This battle was the longest of the war, taking nearly 11 Days of constant battle between thousands of men and orcs.

The battle was won but the losses were great for the orcs. \n\nThe [[Battle of Burning Cliffs]] was won by the humans and marked the point at which the humans broke the orc siege of Nimoar's Hold.\n\nThe [[Battle of the Westwood]] was won by the humans. [[Uruth]], the orc king, was killed in this battle."
