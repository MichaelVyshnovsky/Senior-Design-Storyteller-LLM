        "Battle": "After two years of fierce fighting, the rebel leader [[Nanathlor Greysword]], the [[Green Regent]] of [[Mielikki]], led his ragtag band against the mercenaries and [[devils]] of [[Pasuuk Rensha]], the ruler of Loudwater, somewhere near [[Tanglefork Woods]] on the southern fringe of the [[High Forest]] near the [[River Delimbiyr]],<ref> in the {{YearlinkName|1317}}.\n\nIn the midst of the fighting, Nanathlor called on the goddess Mielikki for aid, and she ''[[awaken]]ed'' the trees surrounding the battlefield and set them to attack Pasuuk's forces. In response, Pasuuk revealed his diabolic dealings by summoning a coven of [[devil]]s to assault the trees. By the day's end, however, Mielikki's servants were victorious and the devils and Pasuuk were all killed in the fighting.",
        "Aftermath": "The corpses of Pasuuk and his fiendish allies were scattered like filth, blackening the soil of Tanglefork Woods with their evil. Over half a century later, it was still as dark as midnight.\n\nNanathlor Greysword became the new High Lord of Loudwater and began work to restore the beauty of nature to the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] after the [[Rensha]]'s strip mines and logging."
