        "History": {
            "Causes": "The [[Rensha]] family had ruled Loudwater and the Delimbiyr Vale since the [[1150 DR|Year of the Scourge, 1150 DR]], and though they made the town prosperous and expanded its connections with the outside world, they exploited the Vale's natural resources and despoiled much of the pristine beauty of the area. Over time, the amoral Renshas descended into decadence and committed several atrocities in pursuit of their dark [[magic]].\n\nInto this area came a mercenary named [[Nanathlor Greysword]], a noble of [[Nimbral]] who'd desired to establish a realm of his own in the [[North]], and found one that needed him. In the [[1315 DR|Year of Spilled Blood, 1315 DR]], Pasuuk commanded a band of talented mercenary hunters, among them Nanathlor, to bring him the horn of a [[unicorn]], apparently for some infernal rite. But Nanathlor stayed his hand and instead defended the unicorn—in fact an [[avatar]] of the [[goddess]] [[Mielikki]]. She made him the new Green Regent and the twelve hunters who stood with him his scions, and tasked them with overthrowing the Renshas.",
            "Battles": "From then on, Nanathlor Greysword and his loyal followers were in rebellion against the rule of Pasuuk Rensha as they struggled to liberate Loudwater.\n\nThe war culminated in the [[Battle of Tanglefork]] in the {{YearlinkName|1317}}, when Nanathlor led his ragtag band against Pasuuk and his forces near Tanglefork Woods on the southern fringe of the [[High Forest]] near the [[River Delimbiyr]].<ref> Nanathlor called on Mielikki for aid, and she ''[[awaken]]ed'' the trees around the battlefield and set them to attack Pasuuk's forces. In response, Pasuuk summoned a coven of [[devil]]s to assault the trees. Ultimately, Mielikki's servants were victorious and the devils and Pasuuk were all killed in the fighting."
        },
        "Aftermath": "With the fall of the Renshas and the end of the War of the Returned Regent, Nanathlor Greysword became the new High Lord of Loudwater. Nanathlor maintained relations with other lands but ended the rampant logging and strip-mining, thus restoring the ecology and fertility of the land, and in turn renewing prosperity in the Vale."
