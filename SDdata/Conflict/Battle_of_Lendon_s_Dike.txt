The '''Battle of Lendon's Dike''' was a battle in the [[Moonsea]] region between the defenders of [[Hulburg]] and their mercenaries against the [[Warlock Knights]] and their [[orc]] and [[hobgoblin]] allies.

==History==
===Background===
In [[Ches]] of [[1479 DR]], [[Kardhel Terov]] of the [[Warlock Knights]] approached warchief [[Mhurren]] of the [[Bloody Skull (Thar)|Bloody Skulls]] orc tribe. He offered the warchief complete control over Thar and its various tribes in return for an oath of fealty. After sacking [[Glister]] with the promised troops and armaments, the army marched on [[Hulburg]] with a force now consisting of the orcs of the Bloody Skulls and [[Burning Daggers]], the [[ogre]]s of the [[Skullsmashers]], the [[hobgoblin]]s of the [[Red Claws]], and a contingent of Warlock Knights and their controlled beasts, including [[wyverns]] and [[manticore]]s.

===Battle ===
They were met northwest of the town by an army half their size, led by [[Kara Hulmaster]], known to the orcs as the Blue Serpent and a fearsome warrior. Kara's army—which consisted of the town's [[Shieldsworn]], mercenaries hired by Hulburg's merchant companies, and the professional mercenary company known as the [[Icehammers]]—was defeated, and the survivors retreated to [[Lendon's Dike]], the last defensible position between them and the town.

There, they were met by [[Geran Hulmaster]] and Hulburg's mostly untrained militia. When the orcs caught up, they held their own for several minutes until an army of [[undead]] appeared, summoned by [[Sergen Hulmaster]] to murder his family. Geran stopped him by stealing the magical amulet—a gift from [[Aesperus]] for Sergen returning his lost [[spellbook]]—that Sergen was using to control the undead. He then turned them on the orcs.

When the sun rose, the amulet crumbled and the undead disappeared, giving the orcs the opportunity to once again attack the Hulburgans. At this point, the forces of [[House Veruna]] fled the field, and if not for Mhurren's death at the hands of Kara, it is likely the tribes would have overrun the defenders. Instead, the orcs and their allies retreated.

===Aftermath===
Their defeat severely weakened the Bloody Skulls tribe and created a power vacuum among the monstrous tribes of Thar. This led to fighting between dozens of tribes of orcs, [[goblinoids]], and [[Giant|giantkin]] as they rushed to assert dominance.

Because of their actions during the battle, House Veruna was banned from the city of Hulburg.
