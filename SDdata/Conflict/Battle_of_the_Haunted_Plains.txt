The '''Battle of the Haunted Plains''' was a battle fought between the [[merfolk]] realm of [[Hmurrath]] and the [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]] [[Axe Kingdoms]] of [[Khuur]] and [[Nmalk]]. It took place in the [[Haunted Plains]] in the undersea land of [[Ser么s]] in the 6th century [[DR]].

==History==
The Axe Kingdoms and Hmurrath fell to fighting in the {{YearlinkName|653}}, beginning the Ninth Ser么s War.

At the Battle of the Haunted Plains in the {{YearlinkName|654}}, the merrow suffered a major defeat. Four-fifths of all merrow in Ser么s were forced to flee south to the other side of the [[Sharksbane Wall]]. The rest survived on the [[Hmur Plateau]] or living amidst the ruins on the [[Haunted Plains]].

This crushing blow and three years of conflict culminated in the destruction of the Axe Kingdoms and the fall of the merrow to the merfolk of Hmurrath in the {{YearlinkName|655}}.
