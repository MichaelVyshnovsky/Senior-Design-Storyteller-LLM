The Battle of Caer Moray was a brief assault on the lycanthrope-held castle at Caer Moray on the Isle of Moray in the Moonshae Isles.
Lycanthropes loyal to the god Malar attacked the settlement at night. They attempted to use rough-cut logs as ladders to scale the castle walls but were initially repelled. They attacked again with renewed vigor and succeeded in gaining the walls and took part of the castle courtyard.
At this time an incarnation of the goddess Chauntea intervened and caused an earthquake and subsequent tsunami that swept the attackers out to sea.  Part of the castles wall was destroyed by the tsunami and the defenders suffered a large number of casualties in the attack.
