The '''War of the Twins''', (or the '''War of the Harts''',) was a war of succession that took place in the kingdom of [[Hartsvale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
===Causes===
When King [[Blod]] of the line of [[Hartkiller]] died, he left behind two twin princes, [[Camden]] and [[Dunstan]]. Since each had equal right to the throne, they began a long and deadly war against each other.

===Battles===
The War of the Twins lasted for three years.

Camden and Goboka's strategy was to use a small band of ogres to pull out Dunstan's forces from their defensible position so that a larger allied force of humans and ogres could attack. The plan was successful, and Dunstan was defeated.

===Aftermath===
While Camden won the war and became king, he alienated many of his subjects in the process. Moreover, his wife soon gave birth to a daughter, [[Brianna Burdun|Brianna]].
