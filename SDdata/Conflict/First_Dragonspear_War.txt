The '''First Dragonspear War''' was an armed conflict between the allied armies of [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Waterdeep]], and the [[devil]]s that dwelled within [[Dragonspear Castle]].

==Location==
The war took place in the region of the [[Sword Coast]] surrounding Dragonspear Castle, as well as within the fortress itself.

==History==
The war was preceded by an increase in monster activity, [[orc]]s, and even fiends raiding the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 1340s [[DR]]. In response to this threat, the [[Amn]]ian castles of [[Citadel Amnur]] and [[Citadel Rashturl]] were rebuilt and upgraded into modern fortresses in order to protect the realm's northern border. By [[1354 DR]], the [[Hold of Battle Lions]] was overwhelmed by devils passing through the ''[[portal]]'' of [[Ithtaerus Casalia]] and the castle had been entirely claimed by the planar invaders, joined by a growing army of [[hobgoblin]]s, [[bugbear]]s, [[troll]]s, and orcs from the [[High Moor]].

In early [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]] of the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, a Waterdhavian patrol passing through the [[Open Marches]] was assaulted by a group of devils and [[goblinoid]]s. The threat posed by the ''portal'' became wider knowledge, and armies around the Sword Coast were readied for what was to come.

The [[Council Army]] of Amn responded by massing its forces on the northern border in preparation for the coming war. They pursued the monstrous assailants back to Dragonspear Castle and set fire to the ancient ruin, but the devils were not beaten and their ranks continued to swell for months.

The [[Knights of the Shield]] noticed the disruption in trade early on, and began hiring their own mercenary armies to fight the growing threat. As the Council Army of Amn mobilized in [[Tarsakh]] to join the fight, the Knights of the Shield disbanded some forces and turned the rest over to join the state army in fully-fledged, fierce combat in the [[Greenfields (Western Heartlands)|Greenfields]]. Far-ranging raiders razed [[Triboar]] and broke into [[Tethyr]], and many villages in the North evacuated to more secure settlements such as [[Mirabar]] and [[Silverymoon]]. The carcasses of conquered devils were paraded through the streets of Waterdeep, bringing some resolve to the population.

[[Mirtul]] saw [[Baldur's Gate]] nearly besieged, the [[Ardeep Forest]] partially burned, and overland travel between Amn, Waterdeep, and [[Iriaebor]] almost entirely halted. An unnatural mist that Blackstaff [[Khelben Arunsun]] struggled to dispel cloaked the land as warbands of goblinoids struck forth and the devils seemed to increase in number. Despite the terrible foes and the obscuring mist, the army of Amn broke the invaders in the Greenfields and began driving north towards Dragonspear Castle itself. Commander [[Reyni Delapond]] was among these troops, and won great acclaim fighting the monsters.

The Waterdhavian and Amnian troops were eventually joined by the [[Flaming Fist]] from [[Baldur's Gate]], and the combined forces were able to defeat the fiends by late summer, with the remaining monsters wiped out by the [[Feast of the Moon]] in [[Uktar]] and most of the soldiers returned home.

===Aftermath===
As part of an effort to keep the area safe, priests of [[Tempus]] built a shrine inside the ruins of the walls. Travelers typically avoided camping in the vicinity of the ruins, and the whole region between the Way Inn and [[Boareskyr Bridge]] was considered overly dangerous. Bands of orcs continued to operate widely across the Western Heartlands, though it was unclear if they were stragglers from Dragonspear or part of a different allegiance such as King [[Graul]].

Around [[1358 DR]], the [[Zhentarim]] played with fire by intentionally opening planar ''portals'' around Dragonspear Castle in order to destabilize the region and take the ruins as their local stronghold, though it met with little success.

In the years that followed, a significant number of [[tiefling]]s appeared in the lands surrounding the castle.
