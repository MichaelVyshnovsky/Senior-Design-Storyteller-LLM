His forces quickly overcame Battledale, Featherdale and Harrowdale, and soon began invading Deepingdale and Mistledale.\nHowever, Cormyr, Hillsfar, Sembia and Zhentil Keep were displeased by Lord Lashan Aumersairs intentions, and an alliance was formed, which saw his defeat and the collapse of his \"empire\".\nThaeron, swordmaster to Lord Elmaer Oraun almost two centuries prior to the battle, who had been living under the guise of farmer Durthar Morgath, but revealing himself as \"Thaeron, Rightful Swordmaster of Harrowdale\", rallied men from northern Harrowdale to fight against Lashan, and was killed in the battle."
