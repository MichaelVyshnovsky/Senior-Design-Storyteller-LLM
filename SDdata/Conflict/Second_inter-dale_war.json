His forces quickly overcame [[Battledale]], [[Featherdale]] and [[Harrowdale]], and soon began invading [[Deepingdale]] and [[Mistledale]].\n\nHowever, [[Cormyr]], [[Hillsfar]], [[Sembia]] and [[Zhentil Keep]] were displeased by Lord Lashan Aumersair's intentions, and an alliance was formed, which saw his defeat and the collapse of his \"empire\".",
        "Combatants": "[[Thaeron]], swordmaster to Lord [[Elmaer Oraun]] almost two centuries prior to the battle, who had been living under the guise of farmer Durthar Morgath, but revealing himself as \"Thaeron, Rightful Swordmaster of Harrowdale\", rallied men from northern Harrowdale to fight against Lashan, and was killed in the battle.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/Harrowdale}}"
