            "The Battle of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge": "Led by Sergeant Knox, the Neverwintan guards fought the undead horde on the Sleeping Dragon Bridge, as it was the last line of defense between the undead and the [[Protector's Enclave]].{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHmoQ7EiHHE|title=Neverwinter Story Trailer|accessmonthday=February 4th|accessyear=2018|author=[[wikipedia:en:Cryptic Studios|Cryptic Studios]] |date=2013}} \n\nLuckily for the defenders, one of the adventurers joined forces with Private Wilfred, and the two forced their way into the city while fighting the horde of undead, and eventually faced Valindra herself and her most powerful undead, the [[Harbinger]], on the Sleeping Dragon Bridge. She didn't pay attention to them, however, and after killing Private Wilfred she left the battlefield. The adventurer had to deal with the Harbinger alone, but in the end was able to defeat it.\n\nWith the Harbinger defeated, the undead horde lost their will to fight and the combined forces of guards and adventurers were able to defeat the horde, this time for good, and lift the siege of Neverwinter."

        "Aftermath": "After their defeat, Valindra and the Red Wizards were forced to flee from the heart of the city. They took refuge in [[Neverdeath]], and began to plot their next movement. In the following weeks, several factions and individuals tried to take advantage of the chaos caused by the attack to advance their own agendas."
