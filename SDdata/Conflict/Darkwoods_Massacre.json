        "Events": {
            "Lead up": "Late in [[331 DR|the Year of Cold Clashes, 331 DR]], the orcs of Vastar launched a surprise attack on [[Cormanthyr]], and occupied a portion of the lands east of the Old [[Elven Court]]. They solidified their forces in the area over the next few years. The akh'velahrn forces of [[Myth Drannor]] attempted to recover these lands three times.",
            "The battle": "The fourth major effort by the akh'velahrn occurred in the height of the summer of [[335 DR|the Year of Seven Stones, 335 DR]] as they ventured into the Darkwoods against them. However, the akh'velahrn forces suffered from ineptness and bigotry among its elven officers. Troop placements were biased, communications were not maintained and orders were not shared while in camp. Worse, they treated the non-elven soldiers cruelly, willingly sacrificing them for the safety of their elven comrades.\n\nThe orcs took advantage of such negligence and surrounded over half the akh'velahrn force while they camped. Then they commenced slaughtering them as they slept, in an event later known as the Darkwoods Massacre. Over one thousand akh'velahrn soldiers were slain in a single night, but only one hundred of them were elven.",
            "Aftermath": "The human guards were among the dead, so no explanation was forthcoming as to how the massacre had occurred. The causes remained mysterious until [[346 DR|the Year of Blushing Stars, 346 DR]], with the conclusion of the court martials of seven officers involved, all elven (two [[moon elf|moon]], five [[gold elf|gold]]). Their incompetence and barbarous behavior were revealed, they were blamed for the Darkwoods Massacre, and they were exiled from Myth Drannor and Cormanthyr.\n\nFor his failure to notice the problem among his soldiers and his own second-in-command, [[Arms-Major]] [[Pirphal Faerondaryl]] tended his resignation, but was refused by [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl]]. Instead, Eltargrim ordered him to resolve the issues. Therefore, Pirphal took three new lieutenants—one human, one [[dwarf]], one [[halfling]]—and commissioned the [[Baneblades of Demron]] for them to wield."
