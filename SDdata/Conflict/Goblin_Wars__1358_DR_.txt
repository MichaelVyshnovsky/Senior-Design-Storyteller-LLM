The '''Goblin Wars''' were a series of conflicts fought in the kingdom of [[Erlkazar]] against invading [[goblin]]s in [[1358 DR]].

==History==
Early in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, King [[Ertyk Uhl]] of the [[Starrock]] tribe led a horde of [[goblin]]s down from the [[High Peaks]] and the [[Kuldin Peaks]] to invade Erlkazar, then under the rule of King [[Valon Morkann]]. For over three months, the goblins laid siege to the city of [[Duhlnarim]]. The goblins' numbers appeared limitless and many heroes and Duhlnarim's mages failed to stop them.

Finally, however, [[Elestam's Crusaders]] forged an alliance with the [[Shieldbreakers]], a reliable [[ogre]] mercenary force from [[Rivenshield]]. The war turned and the goblins were cut down to under a third of their number. After almost a full year of fighting, the conflict ended before the close of the year.

===Legacy===
During the conflict, a brewer of [[Llorbauth]], [[Araneth Idogyr]], met and befriended a [[cyclops]], from whom he acquired the recipe for [[Old One Eye]] ale.

Erlkazar and the Shieldbreakers maintained their alliance against the High Peaks goblins and [[giant]]s as of [[1367 DR]].

According to reports, the goblins had just begun to regain their strength a decade later.

==Combatants==
===Casualties===
Among the casualties was [[Rysodyl Boughstrong]], the [[elf]] husband of High Watcher [[Laxaella Bronshield]], Baroness of [[Tanistan]]. Rysodyl was killed by King Ertyk Uhl himself.
