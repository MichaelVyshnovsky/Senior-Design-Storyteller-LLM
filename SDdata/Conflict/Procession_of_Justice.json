Favored by Valigan, Thelasand spurred Jhaamdath into increased conflict with the [[elves]] of [[Nikerymath]]. This culminated in the elven [[Elven high mage|High Mages]] raising an enormous tsunami that wiped out the empire in the [[-255 DR|Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR]], and reshaped the coastline into the Vilhon Reach.\n\nAfterward, the remnants of Jhaamdath fell into lawlessness and banditry.",
