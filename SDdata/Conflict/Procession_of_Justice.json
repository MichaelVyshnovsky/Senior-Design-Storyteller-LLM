        "mainbody": "The Procession of Justice was a campaign to pacify the remnants of the fallen empire of Jhaamdath in the Vilhon Reach in the mid–3 century DR. In it, the god Tyr himself appeared on Toril, allied with Ilmater, and led a celestial host against the chaotic and evil forces arrayed in the remains of the fallen empire.\nIn the final years of the empire of Jhaamdath, in the Year of Mournful Monuments, −269 DR, the bloodthirsty Exarch Thelasand IV rose to prominence as a trusted advisor to Emperor Dharien, alongside the appearance of the lesser deity of anarchy, Valigan Thirdborn. Favored by Valigan, Thelasand spurred Jhaamdath into increased conflict with the elves of Nikerymath. This culminated in the elven High Mages raising an enormous tsunami that wiped out the empire in the Year of Furious Waves, −255 DR, and reshaped the coastline into the Vilhon Reach.\nAfterward, the remnants of Jhaamdath fell into lawlessness and banditry.\nIn the Year of the Striking Lance, −247 DR, Tyr, god of justice and war, emerged from a portal near what would later be Alaghôn in Turmish in command of an army of two hundred celestial archons.\nIn a highly targeted campaign, Tyrs host crossed the Vilhon Reach into the remnants of Jhaamdath. In the ensuing battle, Valigan Thirdborn was slain by Tyrs divine host. The celestials later hunted for Thelasand himself, who was in hiding.\nDrawn by Tyrs deeds and sacrifices, the older, previously obscure god Ilmater allied himself with Tyr in the Year of the Rack, −243 DR.\nThe Procession of Justice ended in the Year of Fortunes Fair, −238 DR, with much of Tyrs forces banished back to the planes or slain outright and the god taking an interest in wider Toril at the expense of the campaign."
