        "mainbody": "he Battle of Luthcheq was a conflict between the nations of Chessenta, Akan没l, and Tymanther against the dragon players of Brimstones xorvintaal that took place in the Year of the Ageless One.\nWhen Alasklerbanbastos warned Brimstone about Aoth Fezim and the Brotherhood of the Griffon attempts to foil the xorvintaal, the smoke drake allowed the dracolich to reach other dragon allies, including Tchazzar and a few dragon Princes of Murgh么m, among them Astanalan, Chelnadatilar, Ferzath, and Llemgradac, to attack and destroy the Brotherhood, who at the time were in the city of Luthcheq.\nHowever, the battle actually started before the dragons reached the city, when Tchazzar, jealous of one of the members of the Brotherhood, Gaedynn Ulraes, forced Jhesrhi Coldcreek to kill him. Unable to kill her friend, Jhesrhi betrayed Tchazzar and the mad dragon ordered the chessentan army to kill the Brotherhood of the Griffon, and, in a fit of madness, to attack the akan没lan military forces led by Lord Magnol of the Four Stewards who were stationed in the city as allies of Chessenta in a potential war against Tymanther. Searching for more allies, Aoth and the priestess of Amaunator Cera Eurthos sought out the priests of other faiths in Luthcheq, saving them from the followers of Tchazzar who were about to kill them, and convinced them to fight alongside the Brotherhood.\nAlasklerbanbastos and his dragon allies arrived to Luthcheq in the night of Eleint 7, and a huge battle started between the dragons and Tchazzars loyalists against the mercenaries of the Brotherhood and the army of Akan没l. Fearing the destruction of their country, Hasos Thora and Kassur Jedea freed Shala Karanok from Tchazzars dungeons, where she was thrown due to alleged actions of treason against the red dragon. Shala took control of a group of chessentan warriors loyal to her and a few threskelian soldiers, and turned them against Tchazzar and his allies.\nMembers of a tymantheran diplomatic party sent to Luthcheq to reinstate the relations between Tymanther and Chessenta, arrived in the mist of battle and lent their aid to the allied forces against the dragons. The mercury dragon Praxasalandos, a former player of xorvintaal, also helped the allied forces in the battle. However, Praxasalandos was killed when he faced Tchazzar. \nThe paladin Daardendrien Medrash was able to purify a few gem and metallic dragons from the xorvintaal compulsion, and the freed dragons fought against those still bound by the magic of the xorvintaal, changing the tide of the battle. Chelnadatilar was able to kill Ferzath, but Llemgradac died at the hands of Alasklerbanbastos. Despite the death of the emerald dragon, the allied forces were able to kill Tchazzar and destroy Alasklerbanbastos.\nWith Tchazzar dead, his loyalists surrendered and the battle came to an end. The priests of Tiamat killed Halonya, Tchazzars \"high priestess\", in her temple before fleeing the city."
