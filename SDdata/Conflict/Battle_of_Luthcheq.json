        "mainbody": "The '''Battle of Luthcheq''' was a conflict between the nations of [[Chessenta]], [[Akanûl]], and [[Tymanther]] against the [[dragon]] players of [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s ''[[xorvintaal]]'' that took place in the [[1479 DR|Year of the Ageless One]].",
        "History": "When [[Alasklerbanbastos]] warned Brimstone about [[Aoth Fezim]] and the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] attempts to foil the ''xorvintaal'', the [[smoke drake]] allowed the [[dracolich]] to reach other dragon allies, including [[Tchazzar]] and a few dragon [[Princes of Murghôm]], among them [[Astanalan]], [[Chelnadatilar]], [[Ferzath]], and [[Llemgradac]], to attack and destroy the Brotherhood, who at the time were in the city of [[Luthcheq]].\n\nHowever, the battle actually started before the dragons reached the city, when Tchazzar, jealous of one of the members of the Brotherhood, [[Gaedynn Ulraes]], forced [[Jhesrhi Coldcreek]] to kill him. Unable to kill her friend, Jhesrhi betrayed Tchazzar and the mad dragon ordered the chessentan army to kill the Brotherhood of the Griffon, and, in a fit of madness, to attack the akanûlan military forces led by Lord [[Magnol]] of the [[The Four Stewards|Four Stewards]] who were stationed in the city as allies of Chessenta in a potential war against Tymanther. Searching for more allies, Aoth and the [[priest]]ess of [[Amaunator]] [[Cera Eurthos]] sought out the priests of other faiths in Luthcheq, saving them from the followers of Tchazzar who were about to kill them, and convinced them to fight alongside the Brotherhood.\n\nAlasklerbanbastos and his dragon allies arrived to Luthcheq in the night of [[Eleint 7]], and a huge battle started between the dragons and Tchazzar's loyalists against the mercenaries of the Brotherhood and the army of Akanûl. Fearing the destruction of their country, [[Hasos Thora]] and [[Kassur Jedea]] freed [[Shala Karanok]] from Tchazzar's dungeons, where she was thrown due to alleged actions of treason against the [[red dragon]]. Shala took control of a group of chessentan warriors loyal to her and a few [[threskel]]ian soldiers, and turned them against Tchazzar and his allies.\n\nMembers of a tymantheran diplomatic party sent to Luthcheq to reinstate the relations between Tymanther and Chessenta, arrived in the mist of battle and lent their aid to the allied forces against the dragons. The [[mercury dragon]] [[Praxasalandos]], a former player of ''xorvintaal'', also helped the allied forces in the battle. However, Praxasalandos was killed when he faced Tchazzar. \n\nThe [[paladin]] [[Daardendrien Medrash]] was able to purify a few [[gem dragon|gem]] and [[metallic dragon|metallic dragons]] from the ''xorvintaal'' compulsion, and the freed dragons fought against those still bound by the magic of the ''xorvintaal'', changing the tide of the battle. Chelnadatilar was able to kill Ferzath, but Llemgradac died at the hands of Alasklerbanbastos. Despite the death of the emerald dragon, the allied forces were able to kill Tchazzar and destroy Alasklerbanbastos.",
        "Aftermath": "With Tchazzar dead, his loyalists surrendered and the battle came to an end. The priests of [[Tiamat]] killed [[Halonya]], Tchazzar's \"high priestess\", in her temple before fleeing the city."
