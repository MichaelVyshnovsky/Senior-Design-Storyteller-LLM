        "mainbody": "The '''dragonborn rebellion''' was a revolt against the [[dragon]] tyrants of [[Laerakond]], led by the [[dragonborn]] slave clans of [[Skelkor]], that also involved the [[human]] slaves of [[Eskorn]], in the late years of the 13th century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the late years of the 13th century DR, dragonborn and human slaves rebelled against the dragon lords of the nations of Skelkor and Eskorn. In Eskorn, the rebellion was led by the legendary human hero [[Aunglass Roaryl]]. Aunglass himself killed the dragon emperor [[Eskornamundyr]], allowing the Eskornar humans to overcome their dragon masters.\n\nAfter the battle in Eskorn was over, the dragonborn rebels focused their efforts on freeing their clans in Skelkor. The dragonborn heroines [[Iskdara]] and [[Shurideh]] killed the powerful [[silver dragon]] [[Asativarainuth]] in the major [[battle of Arambar Gulch]], obtaining the powerful [[artifact]] known as the [[Eye of Blazing Rorn]]. The two dragonborn sisters later joined forces with the leaders of other rebel war bands, in order to kill the most powerful of the dragon tyrants of [[Abeir]], the [[red dragon]] [[Rhodrolytharnestrix]].\n\nWhile the rest of the dragonborn leaders led their war bands against Rhodrolytharnestrix's dragon army, the heroes Iskara, Shurideh, [[Reshvemi]], and [[Thuchir]] infiltrated the [[Crippled Mountain|Celestial Mountain]], a dormant volcano where Rhodrolytharnestrix had his lair, and dropped the Eye of Blazing Rorn into the volcano, triggering an eruption so powerful that it killed Rhodrolytharnestrix, even though he was a red dragon. This battle was later known as the [[Battle of the Crippled Mountain]].",
        "Aftermath": "The Celestial Mountain was destroyed, and was called the [[Crippled Mountain]] since then. The dragonborn heroes survived the explosion and reunited with the other rebel leaders, creating the dragonborn nation of [[Tymanchebar]]. The ash from the eruption fell for forty days, and the dragonborn began to call themselves the \"''vayemniri''\" (Ash-Marked Ones, in [[Draconic language|Draconic]]), so that they would always remember the way they gained their freedom.\n\nWith Eskornamundyr dead, the Eskornar humans earned their freedom as well, and Eskorn became a human-dominated land."
