            "Aftermath": "As part of an effort to keep the area safe, priests of [[Tempus]] built a shrine inside the ruins of the walls. Travelers typically avoided camping in the vicinity of the ruins, and the whole region between the Way Inn and [[Boareskyr Bridge]] was considered overly dangerous. Bands of orcs continued to operate widely across the Western Heartlands, though it was unclear if they were stragglers from Dragonspear or part of a different allegiance such as King [[Graul]].\n\nAround [[1358 DR]], the [[Zhentarim]] played with fire by intentionally opening planar ''portals'' around Dragonspear Castle in order to destabilize the region and take the ruins as their local stronghold, though it met with little success.\n\nIn the years that followed, a significant number of [[tiefling]]s appeared in the lands surrounding the castle."
