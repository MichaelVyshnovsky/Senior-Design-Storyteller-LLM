        "mainbody": "The '''Bloodstone Wars''' were a series of battles waged during the {{YearlinkName|1359}}, in [[Damara]] between the [[Bloodstone (barony)|Barony of Bloodstone]] and the various puppet duchies and baronies of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]]. Each battle ended in a decisive victory for the then-baron of Bloodstone, [[Gareth Dragonsbane]].",
        "Location": "The Bloodstone Wars took place across northern Damara, predominantly in [[Bloodstone Valley]] and the Duchy of [[Brandiar]].",
        "History": {
            "Causes": "The Bloodstone Wars were the culmination of the chaos inflicted on Damara by Zhengyi the Witch-King following his victory in the [[Vaasan War]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, which entailed the death of King [[Virdin Bloodfeathers]] along with most of the ruling nobility of Damara, and the subsequent installing of the Witch-King's puppets as the leaders of every major Damaran duchy and barony save for Bloodstone. These rulers squabbled among each other, and as taxes rose to cover the cost of tribute to the Witch-King, a refugee crisis began.\n\nThe seeds of the conflict itself were sown in the next year, the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, when Gareth Dragonsbane and his companions accepted a request by Baron [[Tranth]] of Bloodstone to protect the people of [[Bloodstone Village]] from bandits affiliated with the Citadel of Assassins. By winter, the bandits had been driven off and the [[Bloodstone Mines]] had been reclaimed from Zhengyi's allies, drawing the ire of the Witch-King and of his puppets. By [[Mirtul]] of 1359 DR, Gareth had married the baron's daughter, [[Christine Dragonsbane|Christine]], and had been declared the new Baron of Bloodstone. Soon after, he and his companions arrived in [[Heliogabalus]] escorting approximately one million [[gold pieces]] worth of newly mined [[bloodstone]] from the reclaimed Mines. Rumor of these incredible riches spread quickly, drawing thousands of refugees and immigrants to Bloodstone Valley and attracting the jealous and greedy attention of Duke [[William Horgath]] of Arcata and Duke [[Helmont the 14th]] of Carmathan, both of whom made plans to invade the Barony of Bloodstone.\n\nWilliam Horgath, known as William the Lazy, was the first to move against Bloodstone. He was supported by the [[Grandfather of Assassins]], leader of the Citadel of Assassins, who sought to destroy Bloodstone in retaliation for the humiliation of his forces at Bloodstone Village and the disruption of his master Zhengyi's plans in Bloodstone Mines the year prior. The first act of war was an assassination attempt on the lives of Gareth Dragonsbane and his compatriots in Bloodstone Village, which was carried out by a member of the Citadel of the Assassins known as The [[Fist]]. On the heels of this effort, William the Lazy declared war on Bloodstone on the basis of a manufactured slight, and within a month his armies had marched up the [[old King's Road]] and arrived in Bloodstone Valley.",
            "Battles": "",
            "Aftermath": "With Zhengyi defeated, Gareth was hailed as a hero and a savior by many Damarans, although the people of the southern baronies remained skeptical of him. He was surrounded by calls for him to claim the mantle of the King of Damara&mdash;a title to which he held a strong claim thanks to his wife's bloodline In Vaasa, Gareth hired adventurers and bounty hunters to root out his enemies. In Damara, his forces were led by his [[ranger]] companion [[Olwen Forest-Friend]], who swept through Soravia, Gareth was ultimately declared King of Damara also before before the end of that year."
