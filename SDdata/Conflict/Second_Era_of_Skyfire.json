        "mainbody": "The Second Era of Skyfire was a period of hostilities between the efreeti Memnon and the djinni Calim in the late 14 and 15 centuries DR. The ancient hostilities between the two resumed as the High Magic ritual binding the two genies was unraveled by the Spellplague in 1385 DR and ended in 1450 DR when Calim and Memnon were mysteriously sent back to their home planes."
