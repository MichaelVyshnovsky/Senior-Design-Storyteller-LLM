The '''Battle of the Cwm''' took place in the early hours of [[Ches 27]], the {{YearlinkName|1374}},

==Participants==
===Daemonfey===
Led by [[Sarya Dlardrageth]], the daemonfey consisted of 1500 [[fey'ri]], 500 assorted [[demon]]s and [[yugoloth]]s ([[yugoloth]]s, [[mezzoloth]]s, [[vrock]]s, [[hezrou]]s, [[babau]]s, [[nycaloth]]s) and thousands of [[orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[bugbear]]s, and [[troll]]s. Sarya herself did not participate in the battle, nor did her general [[Mardeiym Reithel]]. The glabrezu [[Grushakk]] fought, however.

===Elves===
The elves were led by [[Seiveril Miritar]] and consisted of 2000 Evereskan combatants, and 6000 elves from Evermeet, The elves would also summon [[air elemental]]s. The more notable participants on the elven side were:
* [[Seiveril Miritar]]
* [[Ilsevele Miritar]]
* [[Fflar Starbrow Melruth]]
* [[Araevin Teshurr]]
* [[Grayth Holmfast]] (human)
* [[Maresa Rost]] (human/genasi)
* [[Jorildyn]]
* [[Jerreda Starcloak]]
* [[Elvath Muirreste]]
* [[Vesilde Gaerth]]
* [[Rhaellen]]
* [[Celeilol Fireheart]]
* [[Haraeth Echorn]]
* [[Geren Festryth]]

==Battle==
The daemonfey army arranged themselves on the west side of the battlefield with the elves on the east, on the higher ground near the [[Sunset Gate]], which provided a tactical advantage to the [[archer]]s and spellcasters.

The battle began with the sounding of horns in the daemonfey ranks, at which point the orcs, ogres, and others charged, while the fey'ri took to the air. The elves responded with archers, taking down hundreds from the charge, although the ogres were not so easily felled as the orcs, and the trolls could only be killed with acid or fire. Over a hundred elven spellcasters had disguised themselves beneath the cloaks of the archers and swordsmen, and they simultaneously summoned a large number of [[air elemental]]s, which rose to engage the airborne fey'ri. It only served as a light distraction, however, since the fey'ri outnumbered the summoned elementals tenfold.

During the battle, Araevin cast a flying spell upon himself so that he could more easily reach the fey'ri above, but they soon outnumbered him despite his spellcasting, and one of them dispelled his aerial magic, sending him into a fall and injuring him.

In a crucial moment of the battle, a company of demons teleported to Seiveril's location and engaged the elven leader. He was aided by Fflar, who used the sword ''[[Keryvian]]'' to great effect, defeating two hezrous, while Seiveril himself defeated one hezrou and one nycaloth. A glabrezu, likely Grushakk,<ref group="note">This is assumed to be Grushakk, though this is not mentioned in the text. engaged with Araevin, Ilsevele, Grayth and Maresa, but was quickly brought down and defeated.

The daemonfey armies were forced to retreat soon afterwards.

==Casualties==
Amongst the elves, 500 were killed and another 500 seriously wounded. Notable elven casualties were:
* [[Celeilol Fireheart]]
* [[Geren Festryth]]
* [[Elvath Muirreste]]
* [[Haraeth Echorn]]
The elves estimated thousands of orcs and ogres dead, as well as "dozens and dozens" of fiends destroyed,
