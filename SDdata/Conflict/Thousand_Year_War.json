        "History": {
            "Causes": "In the few centuries that followed their arrival to [[Toril]], dragons generally kept aloof of the giants and ignored them, But they regularly preyed upon the herds of animals the giants founded and tended, such as [[elk]] and [[rothé]].{{Cite dragon+/8/Volo's Guide to Befriending Giants}} This led to many minor conflicts with the giants,\n\nThe war truly began in ''circa'' [[-26000 DR]]. but by most accounts it was when the [[Draconic pantheon|dragon god]] [[Garyx]] sent an [[avatar]] to lead a flight of [[red dragon]]s to attack the giant nation.\n\nWith that act of aggression the giants finally felt that dragonkind posed a serious threat to them and Ostoria went to war. And soon afterward, all races of dragonkind were involved in the conflict.",
            "Battle": "The giants created a powerful colossus [[construct]] called [[Vonindod]] to help them in the fight against the dragons,\n\nOne of the most renowned heroes of the war was the [[frost giant]] [[Hjurnur Wyrmrever]], who killed many dragons single-handedly, though he could not match the Vonindod in terms of wyrms slain. He was credited during this time with killing an adult [[blue dragon]] with a single blow of his [[axe]] and for breaking the spine of a [[black dragon]] over his knees. He ultimately died fighting an ancient [[gold dragon]] general that had previously destroyed many a giant city, though some would say it was a king.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = \n| width  = auto\n| source = From the ''[[Saga of the Dragon Queller]]''\n| text   = I pour [[mead]] to the All-Father for<br />Hjurnur, son of [[Hjurgen]],<br />leveler of [[Ranauroch]],<br />son of [[Ottar]],<br />Jarl of the northern wind-teeth,<br />son of grand Annam,<br />All Seeing, All Knowing, All Quelling,<br />All Father―<br />Fireheart,<br />Mighty reaver of the wyrm's core,<br />He who howled at the sun,<br />He of the quenched heart,<br />He who drowned in the river of swords,…\n}}\n\nDespite the giants best efforts, the dragons ultimately drove them out of the southern portion of Ostoria.
