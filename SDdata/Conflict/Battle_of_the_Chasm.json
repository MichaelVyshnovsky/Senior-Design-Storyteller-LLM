        "mainbody": "he Battle of the Chasm was one of the early engagements between the Bedine tribes of Anauroch and the Zhentilar soldiers that sought to take control of the desert for their Zhentarim masters.\nThe battle occurred in the canyons around and leading into the Well of the Chasm oasis in the Sword region of Anauroch.\nAfter wiping out the Qohadar and the Mtair Dhafir tribes, the Zhentilar army marched upon the Well of the Chasm and sought to destroy the Razahi. As Sheikh Utaiba led his warriors in defense of their home, Sheikh Saar and the Bait Mahwa marched down the canyon pathway behind their forward scouts, led by the young Mtairi warrior Kadumi.\nWhen the Mahwai arrived at the siege, they found the Zhentilar soldiers and their asabi mercenaries positioned between the two tribes, with no rearguard in sight. After letting loose an initial volley of arrows, claiming many asabi deaths, a single Zhentarim wizard let loose arcane fire upon the Mahwai vanguard and scattered their forces. The witch Ruha was able to eliminate the wizard with a conjured sand lion as the asabi returned fire their crossbows, and an full-on melee broke out.\nJust as the Mahwai gained the upper hand against the asabis in the canyon, the camel-mounted Razhadi warriors were able to break the siege line and route the Zhent assailants. The asabi mercenaries began to mount and climb the canyons walls to circle back and gain advantage over the Razhadi, but were stopped by Ruha when she brought the sands of the canyon walls down like streaming water and buried the lizards beneath it.\nThe united Bedine warriors were victorious, having defeated a force that was many times greater their number in size. It set the stage for the battles that would follow, and mass-poisoning.\nThe Battle of the Chasm took place during the series of skirmishes that arose between the Bedine and the Zhent forces during the . As the first battle in the ongoing conflict, it was followed by Battle of the Fissures at the southern end of the Wall of Fallen Djinn mountain range."
