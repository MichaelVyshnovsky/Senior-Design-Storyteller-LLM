King Sharaun Mirandor and his three sons led a small army north to meet them and were defeated and slain in battle, killing off the Mirandor dynasty.\nDuke Harandil Durlaven—Sharauns son-in-law—mustered another army and went after the orcs. The horde was routed at the Battle of Bloody Reeds.\nHarandil was declared king of Impiltur by the acclamation of his followers, and crowned on the battlefield itself. This founded the Durlaven dynasty.\nCategoryBattles\nCategoryEvents in Impiltur\nCategoryEvents in Northeast Faerûn\nCategoryEvents in Faerûn\nCategoryEvents on Toril\nlttwfg8xdmjhzy4a16ubh6fynloasan"
