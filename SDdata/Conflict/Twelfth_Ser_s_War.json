        "mainbody": "The Twelfth Ser√¥s War was the major event in the Sea of Fallen Stars of the 1,439 year of Timesong (1369 DR). It involved the destruction brought by Iakhovas the Ravager, a great shark.\nThe war officially began on Eldasong 21 when Iakhovas and his sahuagin demolished a large portion of the Sharksbane Wall and destroyed Akhanmyr.\nIakhovas soon allied with the morkoth of Olleth, the merfolk of Thurindru, and the koalinth of the Sea Hulks tribe. They attacked the Xedran Reefs.\nSahuagin caused the death of over 1,000 unhatched shalarin in Esrath, which enraged all the shalarin of Asarem and brought them into the war as well.\nIakhovas next used magic to turn the entire population of the Whamite Isles into zombies to fight for him. Avina, Lacuan, and Voalidru soon fell. In revenge, ixitxachitls from the Xedran Reefs annihilated three-quarters of the koalinth army.\nThe allied good races, known as the Nantarn Alliance rallied at Xadea and Myth Nantar. The merfolk of Xadea lost great numbers in an attempt to draw Iakhovas and his army toward Myth Nantar for a planned trap. His army began to break apart and was pressed against the forces of Myth Nantar.\nThe war ended on Roamsong 23 of  when the High Mages of Myth Nantar created a whirlpool gate that cast Iakhovas into the Outer Sea. Many ships on the surface were destroyed and two of the High Mages were also lost."
