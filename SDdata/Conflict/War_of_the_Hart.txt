The War of the Hart (not to be confused with the War of the Harts) was a battle that took place between Hartkillers human and giant-kin armies and the giants.
It took place many hundreds of years before the 14 century DR. Hartkiller eventually forced the giants to leave the valley of Hartsvale, but he was killed by a storm giant at the end of the war.
After the conclusion of the war, a purple misty apparition visited the giants, warning them that they were rejecting Annam All-Fathers will by refusing to comply with Hartkiller, that the humans in Hartsvale survived as a punishment to the giants, and that Annam was destined to return when a new king emerged from Hartsvale to restore the kingdom of Ostoria.
