        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|-111}}, several massive orc hordes came south from their homes in the [[Spine of the World]] and [[Ice Mountains]] to devastate the civilizations of the North.\n\nThe orcs nearly crippled the [[dwarf|dwarven]] realm of [[Delzoun]] through numerous attacks, and overran its capital city, [[Gauntlgrym]]. They also conquered the [[human]] city of [[Illusk]]; the majority of Illuskans had fled the city before its fall, either onto the sea or with the aid of [[magic]], and survived.\n\nFinally, an alliance of the [[elves]] of [[Iliyanbruen]], [[Rilithar]], [[Siluvanede]], and [[Earlann]] stopped the orcs  before they could reach the [[High Forest]] and [[Dessarin River|Dessarin Valley]], and broke their strength.\n\nThe Illuskans were able to return and rebuild their home in the {{YearlinkName|-108}}. Gauntlgrym remained abandoned until the {{YearlinkName|141}}, when an effort was made to resettle it."
