        "mainbody": "The '''Battle of Bryn Shander''' was fought between the barbarian tribes of [[Icewind Dale]] and the defenders of the [[Ten Towns]] in the [[1351 DR|Year of the Crown, 1351 DR]].",
        "History": {
            "Causes": "The barbarian tribes of Icewind Dale had long raided the villages of the Ten Towns, but, as autumn of 1351 DR came and the herds moved south, the tribes chose to make one massive thrust in an attempt to occupy the communities and live off slave labor from their conquered foes.\n\n[[Regis]], a member of the Council of the Ten Towns, convinced his fellow councilmen to form an alliance against the threat.",
            "Battle": "Before the battle, a traitor from one of the Ten Towns named [[deBernezan]] revealed their weaknesses to the barbarians. However, [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] spied on the barbarians and deBernezan and learned their plans and promptly informed [[Bruenor Battlehammer]].\n\nThe bulk of the barbarian force moved south to [[Bryn Shander]]. Once the city was occupied, the barbarians figured they could strike at leisure at the other communities. Aware of the plan, the men of [[Maer Dualdon]] hid in [[Termalaine]], while a threefold trap was prepared in Bryn Shander for the main host of barbarians. Inside the city walls stood the combined forces of Bryn Shander, [[Caer-Konig]], and [[Caer-Dineval]], armed with bows and hot oil. Outnumbered, the barbarians turned back and found the way blocked by Bruenor's [[dwarves]]. Townspeople from all three lakes surrounded the tribe and victory was secured.",
            "Aftermath": "During the battle, Bruenor Battlehammer captured the young tribesman [[Wulfgar]], whom he kept as an indentured servant for five years and one day."
