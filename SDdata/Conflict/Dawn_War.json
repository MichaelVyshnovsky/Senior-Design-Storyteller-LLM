        "mainbody": "The '''Dawn War''' was an ancient conflict that raged between the [[primordial]]s and the [[god]]s at the Age Before Ages. The conflict was massive, spanning entire [[Cosmology|planes of reality]], The war encompassed the eras known on Abeir-Toril as the [[Blue Age]] and the [[Shadow Epoch]].\n\n{{Quote|The primordials and the gods had not yet made contact in this long ago era before the Dawn War. The birth of the [[Abyss]] changed this, as it changed so many things. . . .|''Excerpt from the [[Demonomicon of Iggwilv]].''|}}",
        "Location": "The Dawn War took place mostly on the [[Astral Sea]], the [[Shadowfell]], and in many worlds of the Prime Material plane.",
        "History": {
            "Causes": "According to the sages of [[Faerûn]], the Dawn War began when the primordials invaded [[Realmspace]], as they coveted the newly born worlds of this universe. This happened soon after [[Toril]] was seeded with life, so [[Selûne]] and [[Shar]] both moved to defend the worlds of Realmspace against the primordial threat.\n\nThe [[Demonomicon of Iggwilv]] suggest a more sinister cause for the war, however. According to [[Iggwilv]], when the Oerthian deity [[Tharizdun]] found the [[Shard of Pure Evil]] in his quest for a weapon that would allow him to conquer the [[multiverse]],<ref name=\"MM4e-p52/>\n\nInfuriated against Tharizdun, the obyriths tried to destroy him, but the Shard of Pure Evil had given Tharizdun powers the obyriths couldn't have predicted. Using his newfound power to enslave the [[demon]]s that were spawned by the Abyss, Tharizdun opposed the obyriths for eons before the two forces reached a stalemate. Meanwhile, a group of primordials went into the Abyss out of curiosity, and were corrupted in the process, becoming [[demon lord]]s. Among them were [[Baphomet]], [[Demogorgon]] and [[Orcus]].\n\nLike it did with Tharizdun, the Shard of Pure Evil corrupted Obox-Ob and compelled him to plant it in the Astra Sea. Aware that if Obox-Ob did that he would become the master of the multiverse, Demogorgon, Baphomet and Orcus joined forces and defeated Obox-ob. The battle was so violent that it created the [[Blood Rift]], where the Shard of Pure Evil fell, never to be seen again. When he became aware of their presence, Tharizdun tried to control Baphomet, Demogorgon and Orcus, like he did with the lesser demons spawned by the Abyss, but they proved to be very powerful and opposed him. Avoiding to risk defeat at the hands of the demon lords, Tharizdun retreated to the Elemental Chaos.<ref name=\"MM4e-p52/>\n\nUnder the guise of \"The Elder Elemental Eye\", the first of the primordials (a ruse devised by Tharizdun to gain the trust of the primordials), Tharizdun marshaled the forces of the primordials, who were already angered by the gods' intervention with the worlds of the Material plane. This movement eventually gave origin to the [[Cult of Elemental Evil]], rallying other elemental creatures and demons of the Abyss under the banner of \"The Elder Elemental Eye\". Among the converts, only a few knew the true identity of Tharizdun. Of those few, a [[tanar'ri]] known as [[Miska the Wolf-Spider]] soon advanced through the ranks and became a high ranking officer of the elemental forces.\n\nHowever, the creation of the Abyss caught the attention of the other gods at last, who temporarily put aside their differences and joined forces in order to imprison Tharizdun.\n\nWith Tharizdun imprisoned, Miska the Wolf-Spider took control of the forces of the Cult of the Elemental Evil and launched an attack on the Abyss, intending to reclaim the Shard of Pure Evil for himself. While he faced the forces of the Prince of Demons Obox-Ob, the [[Queen of Chaos]] appeared and killed the obyrith, giving the title of Prince of Demons to Miska the Wolf-Spider, who gave her his allegiance in exchange for her aid in destroying the gods.\n\nRegardless of the actual causes of the war, the Dawn War started when the primordials launched an attack (either on their own or led by Miska the Wolf-Spider) on the Astral Sea, destroying the [[w:c:dnd4:Lattice of Heaven|Lattice of Heaven]], prompting the gods to retaliate.",
            "War on the multiverse": "While most battles happened on the world of Nerath,{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|78}}\n\nThings became even harder for the gods when some primordials, led by the powerful [[Timesus]] the Black Star, went to the center of the Shadowfell, a place called [[Death's Reach]], and began to consume the souls of the dead to increase their powers. With his new power, Timesus was able to effortlessly kill many of the younger gods. Eventually, Shar and Selûne summoned gods from other dimensions, among them the gods of the world of Nerath, to aid the native gods in their struggles against the primordials and their servants. \n\nSome sources say that [[Bane]] was the first to organize the forces of the gods. He devised clever tactics, instructing the gods to set aside their differences and work together in small groups of three or five members, and sending those teams to fight specially mighty primordials. In a battle that destroyed countless worlds, Bane led the gods to victory by killing [[Tabrach-Ti]] the Queen of Bronze, the first primordial to fall in the war.\n\nAt some point during this conflict, the goddess [[Auril]] killed the primordial [[Dur-baagal]].{{Cite dragon/367/Hall of the Frostmaiden|61}} Meanwhile, the primordial [[Rorn]] of the Rages, unable to control his temper, killed many gods and even other primordials during the conflict, earning the enmity of both factions.\n\nThe [[dragon]] god [[Io]] intervened in the war on his own, leading his army of dragons against the forces of the primordials. He killed many primordials on his own. However, in one of the most violent battles of the war, in his arrogance Io faced alone a primordial called [[Erek-Hus]] the King of Terror, and was killed when the primordial cleaved him in two with his [[adamantine]] axe. \n\nThe same legend told that [[Bahamut]] and [[Tiamat]] were born from the two halves of the dead god. \n\nEons passed, and the Blue Age became the Shadow Epoch after [[the sun]] of Realmspace was devoured by the primordial known as [[Dendar the Night Serpent]]. During this phase of the war, [[World Serpent|Ouroboros the World Serpent]] was the major force leading the armies of the gods. All seemed lost until the primordial [[Ubtao]] the Deceiver turned against his kin and aided the gods in imprisoning many of his former allies. The gods were able to launch a full attack on Death's Reach, defeating Timesus and sealing him away, depriving the primordials of one of their most powerful assets. \n\nMeanwhile, Bahamut's allies, the [[Wind Dukes of Aaqa]], and an [[exarch]] of [[Moradin]], crafted the [[Rod of Law]] and defeated Miska the Wolf-Spider at the Battle of Pesh on the world of Oerth, which shattered the armies of the primordials, and the Queen of Chaos retreated with her armies back into the Abyss.\n\nLegends told that in the final battle of the Dawn War, the Oerthian deity [[w:c:dungeonsdragons:Kord|Kord]] slew the primordial [[Sehil]] barehanded."

        "Aftermath": "The gods of the world of Athas were destroyed or driven away by the primordials during the conflict, and some of the primordials who survived the Dawn War became the masters of that world after the war ended.\n\nConcerned by the unparalleled destruction caused by the gods and primordials to the worlds of Material plane, the [[nature spirit]]s enacted the \"[[primal ban]]\", a powerful magic that bans [[outsider]]s from the Material plane unless they are summoned by its inhabitants.\n\nIn Realmspace, the sun was recreated and the oceans thawed. This ended the Dawn War and began the [[Days of Thunder]]."
