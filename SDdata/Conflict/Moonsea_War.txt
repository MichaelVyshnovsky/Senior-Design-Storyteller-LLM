'''The Moonsea War''' was a conflict between the allied forces of [[Phlan]], [[Hillsfar]], [[Sembia]], [[Melvaunt]] and [[Zhentil Keep]] against the increasingly imperialistic [[Mulmaster]]. Mulmaster was blockading the [[River Lis]], an important trade river that connected the [[Moonsea]] to the [[Dragon Reach]] and [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. The allied armies attacked in [[1306 DR]]. The attack was successful, Mulmaster was defeated and its fleet no longer controlled the river.<ref>
