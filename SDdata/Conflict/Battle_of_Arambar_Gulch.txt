The Battle of Arambar Gulch was a major battle the dragonborn slaves of Skelkor fought during their rebellion, before they gained their freedom.
During the rebellion of the Skelkoran dragonborn slaves, the rebel dragonborn leaders Iskdara and Shurideh fought the powerful silver dragon Asativarainuth at Arambar Gulch. The twins managed to kill the dragon and steal a powerful artifact known as the Eye of Blazing Rorn.
The victory at Arambar Gulch proved to be decisive for the slave rebellion, as it allowed the slaves to get the artifact that eventually would allow them to defeat Rhodrolytharnestrix and earn their freedom in the climatic battle of the Crippled Mountain.
