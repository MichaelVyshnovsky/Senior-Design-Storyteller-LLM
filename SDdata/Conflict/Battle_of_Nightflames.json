Mulsparkh had been created by the Twisted Rune as part of their plot to exact revenge upon Rythan for his murdering Jhaniloth Puiral a few years earlier in 1330 DR.\nCategoryBattles\nCategoryEvents in Tethyr\nCategoryEvents in the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryEvents in West Faerûn\nCategoryEvents in Faerûn\nCategoryEvents on Toril\n1pqtu5sn2qj59tiwtv3nq8crwx9q64w"
