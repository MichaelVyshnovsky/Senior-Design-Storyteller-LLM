The '''Battle of Tsagang''' was a battle fought between the forces of [[Tabot]] and [[Shou Lung]] in {{YearlinkConvert|646|SY}}.

==History==
When soldiers of Shou Lung under the [[Ho Dynasty]] invaded Tabot that year, the tribes of the lowland cities and the remaining priests and monks of the mountain [[monasteries]] (who themselves had fled persecution in Shou Lung between {{YearlinkConvert|585|SY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|640|SY}}) were forced to ally against them. Baron [[Ohn]] of [[Han Chao]] commanded his warriors and the great [[sohei]] [[Ramara]] led a force of monks and together they repelled the Shou in the Battle of Tsagang.

Afterward, Ramara and Ohn negotiated for ten days and established the [[Peace Land Treaty]] between the tribes and the monks. They also founded the city of [[Tsagang]] at the site and founded the new nation of Tabot. All present blessed the union and it came to be a holy place and a holy word.
