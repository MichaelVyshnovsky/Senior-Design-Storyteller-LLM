The '''Fiend Wars''', were a series of conflicts in the 8{{th}} century [[DR]], between the armies dedicated to [[the Triad]] and the [[demon]]s of the [[Scaled Horde]] that invaded the realm of [[Impiltur]].{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom|69}}

{{Quote|With great sacrifice we defeated the fiends that brought ruin to our cities and callously hunted and slew our people for sport. As one, we emerged triumphant from those terrible times and sang songs of praise to the Triad.|[[Alither Ementharn|Alither "Surequill" Ementharn]], [[1373 DR]].}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|726}}, Impiltur was overrun by the demonic hordes led by the [[balor]] [[Ndulu]]. Ndulu was empowered by the ''[[Crown of Narfell]]'', which was itself controlled by the malign [[demon prince]] [[Orcus]]. Settlements along the [[Easting Reach]] fell quickly, while only [[Milvarn]] managed to muster an organized defense. The king of Impiltur [[Forvar II]], was slain and the royal [[Durlarven]] dynasty was ended. 

In response, the [[church of Torm|churches of Torm]], [[church of Tyr|Tyr]], and [[church of Ilmater|Ilmater]] initiated what came to be known as the '''Triad Crusade'''. They gathered valorous warriors from across [[Faer√ªn]], and rallied together under the leadership of the young [[paladin]] [[Sarshel Elethlim]]. 

After three years of occupation, Sarshel Elethlim led the combined armies of the Triad across the sea to the [[Easting Coast]] in the {{YearlinkName|729}}. They immediately engaged the forces of the Scaled Horde. any battles broke out over the course of the next two years. 

In the {{YearlinkName|731}}, Sarshel led his forces intot he [[Citadel of Conjurers]] to confront the balor Ndulu. He destroyed the ''Crown of Narfell'', breaking Orcus' control over the Scaled Horde. Ndulu and the demons were forced to retreat.<ref group="note">While ''[[Champions of Valor]]'' states the war ended in [[732 DR]]; ''[[Champions of Ruin]]'', ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'', and ''[[Dragon magazine 346]]'' states it ended in [[731 DR]]. 

==Outcomes==
While the demonic army was broken, not all of the fiends were eradicated. Those that remained retreated into the nearby [[Rawlinswood]] forest.

The Fiend Wars led to the formation of the [[Order of the Triad]] the [[732 DR|year after]] the fighting ended.
