The '''Second Era of Skyfire''' was a period of hostilities between the [[efreeti]] [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]] and the [[djinni]] [[Calim]] in the late 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. The ancient hostilities between the two resumed as the [[High Magic]] ritual binding the two [[genie]]s was unraveled by the [[Spellplague]] in [[1385 DR]] and ended in [[1450 DR]] when Calim and Memnon were mysteriously sent back to their home planes.
