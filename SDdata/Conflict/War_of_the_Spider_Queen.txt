The '''War of The Spider Queen'''{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|7}}<ref><ref> was a series of conflicts that took place in the [[drow]] cities of [[Menzoberranzan]], [[Ched Nasad]], [[Eryndlyn]], and [[Maerimydra]] and others in the [[Underdark]] over [[1372]] and [[1373 DR]] during the [[Silence of Lolth]].

==Overview==
The drow of the Underdark, highly dependent upon the powerful clerical [[magic]] of their dark goddess, were greatly weakened by [[Lolth]]'s failure to answer prayers during her Silence (for reasons then unknown to them).

The other organized races of the Underdark like the [[duergar]] sought to exact revenge upon the drow and to usurp their power, began to make threatening moves towards the drow cities.{{Cite web enhancement/City of Wyrmshadows|4}} the [[Scoured Legion]] of [[Hellgate Keep]], the forces of [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]], and the churches of [[Kiaransalee]] and [[Vhaeraun]] began to do the same.

Lolth's silence threatened to rip apart the very fabric of matriarchal drow society, with females (of whom the greater part were [[cleric]]s) left magically bereft, and males (many of whom were merchants, warriors, annd [[wizard]]s) left in a position of power.

The drow of Menzoberranzan, through [[Triel Baenre]], sent a group of powerful adventurers—initially [[Quenthel Baenre]], [[Pharaun Mizzrym]], [[Ryld Argith]], [[Valas Hune]] and the [[draegloth]] [[Jeggred Baenre]]—to discover the cause of Lolth's silence (or, as was then suspected, disfavor).

==History==
===First Year===
On [[Eleasias 28]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Lolth went silent and stopped granting [[spell]]s to her clerics. She did not answer prayers or give any signs. Many sacrifices were made in an attempt to 'atone' for whatever misdeeds the priesthood were believed to have performed.

Almost immediately, several noble houses in Maerimydra start slaughtering one another.

Seizing their chance, the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] commenced attacks and schemes to gain power in drow settlements all through the Underdark. In [[Dusklyngh]], [[Jhachalkyn]], and [[Karsoluthiyl]], they would enable the male-led merchant houses to gain influence at the cost of the weakened power of the Matron Mothers. One of their number, [[Nimor Imphraezl]], instigated strife in Menzoberranzan.

On [[Eleint 23]], [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]] attacked Maerimydra outright with an army of [[goblin]]s, [[ogre]]s and other [[giant]]s, and even [[demon]]s. He had the aid of the city's archmage [[Duneth Wharreil]]. The drow population was largely killed or enslaved, while refugees fled in small groups into the [[Deep Wastes]]. Only [[House Dhuurniv]] remained strong, as most of their holdings lay outside the city. [[Irae T'sarran]] took over Castle Maerimydra during the chaos. She killed Duneth and conquered Maerimydra while her daughter Dorina took over [[Szith Morcane]] to the west. Irae summoned Kiaransalee's [[Undying Temple]] to the [[Material Plane]] and Dorina launched raids on [[Daggerdale]].

In Menzoberranzan, many drow males vanished without explanation. [[Matron mother]]s suspected that they must know something about Lolth. Against Triel's wishes, on [[Marpenoth 13]], [[Gromph Baenre]] ordered [[Pharaun Mizzrym]] to investigate. Pharaun recruited Ryld to help. Meanwhile, Gromph sent [[demon]]ic assassins to kill [[Quenthel Baenre]]. Pharaun and Ryld discovered the missing males to be working with an [[alhoon]] who planned to cause a slave rebellion in order to weaken the city. They killed the alhoon and the rebellion was crushed mercilessly by drow soldiers on [[Marpenoth 20]].

Afterward, leaving Menzoberranzan on [[Marpenoth 26]], Quenthel's company journey to [[Ched Nasad]]. There, [[House Zauvirr]] captured Quenthel Baenre. As part of a failed coup attempt in Ched Nasad, House Zauvirr hired a [[duergar]] mercenary company to attack the city on [[Uktar 3]]. However, the Jaezred Chaulssin sold [[stonefire]] bombs to the duergar, which burn the calcified webs that held up the buildings and roads of each level of the city. The levels collapsed and Ched Nasad was destroyed. Quenthel's company escape through a ''[[portal]]'' and begin searching for priests of [[Vhaeraun]].

On [[Uktar 15]], Menzoberranzan came under siege from the duergar of [[Gracklstugh]], the [[Scoured Legion]] of [[tanarukk]]s from [[Hellgate Keep]] commanded by [[Kaanyr Vhok]], and Menzoberranzan's own [[House Agrach Dyrr]]. They were covertly supported by the Jaezred Chaulssin.

Quenthel's company finally reached the [[Demonweb Pits]] on [[Uktar 16]], but were betrayed by their Vhaeraunite guide, [[Tzirik]], who summoned his god to attack the defenseless Lolth. [[Selvetarm]] arrived to battle Vhaeraun but both fell off the web and plummeted into the darkness below.

All up, by the close of the year, Ched Nasad was obliterated with its ruins in the grasp of the Jaezred Chaulssin, Eryndlyn had been taken over by the followers of Vhaeraun and Ghaunadaur, Maerimydra was in the grip of the faithful of Kiaransalee, and Menzoberranzan seemed set to follow.

===Second Year===
Lolth's Silence ended when she was transformed into a [[greater deity]] on [[Ches 28]] of the {{YearlinkName|1373}}.<ref>

Soon after, Vhaeraun-worshiping surface-dwelling drow in the [[Darkwoods]], [[Velarswood]], and [[Eastern Fringe]] came under attack from Lolth's [[Lady Penitent]].

Meanwhile, in the ruins of Ched Nasad, the Jaezred Chaulssin worked to establish control over what remained.

On [[Ches 30]], the Scoured Legion withdrew their forces from Menzoberranzan, thus lifting the siege.

===Aftermath===
As of the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Lolth and [[Eilistraee]] were playing a game of ''[[sava]]'' of divine proportions, with the stakes being the fate of the drow and their own existence. Vhaeraun's followers used [[Elven High Magic]] to open a portal to Eilistraee's realm that Vhaeraun used to effort to slay his sister. But he failed, as Eilistraee slew Vhaeraun instead and absorbed his [[portfolio]].<ref>

As a result, the [[Church of Eilistraee]] absorbed the [[Church of Vhaeraun]] and the [[Church of Lolth]] absorbed the [[Church of Selvetarm]].

Kiaransalee foolishly joined in the game of ''sava'' and in the {{YearlinkName|1377}}, her followers tried to alter the Underdark's natural ''[[faerzress]]'' magic to affect the ability of drow to use [[teleport]]ation or [[divination]] magic. In retribution, Eilistraee's followers assault the [[Acropolis of Thanatos]] in [[V'elddrinnsshar]] under the [[Galena Mountains]] and killed Kiaransalee's high priestesses, the [[Crones of Thanatos|Crones]]. Meanwhile, other followers, Q'arlynd Melarn and his apprentices, invoke Elven High Magic using use six ''[[kiira]]'' discovered in the ruins of [[Miyeritar]] to remove all mention of Kiaransalee's name from [[Toril]]. Without worshipers, she faded from existence.<ref>

The {{YearlinkName|1379}}, saw Eilistraee and her chosen [[Qilué Veladorn]] killed by the Lady Penitent at the urging of Lolth's champion [[Wendonai]]. However, roughly 20% of all drow were redeemed in the eyes of the [[Seldarine]] and their divine curse was lifted, restoring to them their lighter skin and normal elven temperament.<ref>

Finally, that same year, Lolth attempted to destroy her last rival in the [[Dark Seldarine]], [[Ghaunadaur]]. However, the Lord of Slime turned out to be proved to be much older and more powerful than Lolth had expected. Ghaunadaur left the Demonweb and created his new divine realm in the [[Deep Caverns]], thus ending the War of the Spider Queen.{{speculation}}

==Combatants==
During the conflicts, the vengeful clerics eradicated [[spider]]s and [[monstrous spider]]s in [[drow]] cities. Those of Kiaransalee even paid a bounty for spider legs. The Kiaransaleens even raised Lolth's slain sacred spiders as [[undead]] creatures known as [[husk vermin]] and dispatched them against the still-faithful priestesses of Lolth. They also persuaded the mutant [[shunned]] rejected by Lolth to join them, but ultimately betrayed them.
