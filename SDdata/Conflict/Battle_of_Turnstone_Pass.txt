'''Battle of Turnstone Pass''', also known as '''Moonlight's Triumph''',

==Preparation==
The [[Moonlight Men]] mercenaries had reached [[Turnstone Pass]] before the [[orc]]s, who were approaching from the north. Archers were positioned at the south end of the pass in ambush, while spellcasters took the high ground of the hills that the pass penetrated. Piles of heavy rocks were also stacked up on the hills ready to drop from above. The entire mercenary force was then concealed behind ''[[invisibility]]'' spells until the orcs had committed their forces.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}}

==Battle==
The vast majority of the orcs went through the pass, while a small number of them diverted to their left. When the bulk of the orcs were in position, thousands of arrows were let loose, and rockslides were triggered. Then the spellcasters rained destructive spells down upon the orcs; however, they had not accounted for the horde's magical protections, [[Talisman of spell turning|talismans]] made from [[iris agate]], [[silver]], and [[dragon]] bone, which turned much of the [[magic]] back on its casters.

The Moonlight Men supposedly carried several [[Horn of blasting|''horns of blasting'']] to soften up the orcs before the battle descended into melee combat, which would have helped the still-outnumbered remaining mercenaries.

The entire battle lasted for hours.

==Aftermath==
Only six Moonlight Men, including their leader, [[Mintiper Moonsilver]], were left to claim victory. These remaining mercenaries buried their fellows in a mass grave later known as the [[Cairn of Moonlight]] before leaving the site. Men from Everlund claimed to have burned four thousand orc corpses on pyres after they had left.

After the battle, Mintiper composed a ballad, ''[[Moonlight Paean]]'', which was included in the famous collection of his works, ''[[Mintiper's Chapbook]]''.
