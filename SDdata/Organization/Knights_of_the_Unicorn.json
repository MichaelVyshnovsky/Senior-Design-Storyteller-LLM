        "mainbody": "The Knights of the Unicorn were an adventuring party, and later a mercenary company, established some time before 1358 DR. They derived their name from their service to Lurue, the Unicorn Queen.\nThe Knights of the Unicorn ventured throughout the Sword Coast, taking on duties that aligned with their worship of the Unicorn Queen. These included the rescue of those in need and the uplifting of those who could not stand alone, whether because they were downtrodden or simply because they had been outgrown by their lofty dreams. These chivalric behaviors and ideals did not wane when they became a mercenary company, and neither did their reverence of Lurue, but were nonetheless difficult to sustain as a proper corps rather than as an adventuring party.\nThe Knights did not have a single, formal headquarters, but whenever they met in Baldurs Gate, they made the Helm and Cloak their unofficial base of operations. Therein was the marble bust of a unicorn with a bronze horn, their symbol, whose horn would be rubbed or kissed for luck.\nThe Knights of the Unicorn began as an adventuring party of young aristocrats from various cities on the Sword Coast, all pursuing whimsy and classical romance as their way of worshipping Lurue. The original Knights thought little of it, wanting only to have fun and taking lightly their dedication to the Unicorn, but after a few adventures, they began to recognize how dangerous this way of life truly was. Rather than despair, however, this matured outlook also brought with it a new understanding of the ideals that Lurue pursued. They knew, now, that they had to live life to its fullest, laughing in the meanwhile, and quest according to any whim or dare. They knew that even impossible dreams were to be chased after, because completing these would bring only wonder, and that anyones strengths were worthy of being praised, as their weaknesses were worthy of being allayed. \nAt least seven of the Knights made their base in Baldurs Gate, including their leader, Javalar Roaringhorn, as well as Balanta Whiteshield and Jolboss Twylar, but they were, more often than not, found roaming the whole of the Sword Coast North. \nSome time in the , the Knights of the Unicorn found themselves with the opportunity to strike a blow against a bandit group that committed crime along the Sword Coast. When the time came to swiftly and finally attack the bandits central stronghold, the Knights hired a unit of mercenaries, some of which were rogues and rangers, as support. Upon their victory, the Knights decided to permanently recruit a majority of these mercenaries, around 50 or so, which marked their transition into the Knights of the Unicorn mercenary company.\nAt some point, one of the Knights slew a black dragon that had been terrorizing Baldurs Gate for food and profit. To do this, the Knight hid among the offerings being given to the dragon, which allowed him to strike while the dragon slept. Certain rumors say this was only possible because he obscured his scent using pig dung. Ultimately, he hung the dragons prized head above the gate, and this triumph was honoured in the naming of Black Dragon Gate.\nFollowing the Time of Troubles, the Knights split into smaller affiliated groups collectively referred to as the Order of the Unicorn,\n* Javalar Roaringhorn, their leader.\n* Balanta Whiteshield\n* Jolboss Twylar\n* Halesta, an ex-Knight who ran the Helm and Cloak in 1482 DR.\n* Vedren, Halestas husband and coworker, also a retired Knight.\n* Isteval\n* Mithann"
