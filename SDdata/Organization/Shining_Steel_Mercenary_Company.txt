The Shining Steel Mercenary Company was a disbanded mercenary company around 1358 DR.
The Shining Steel originated as an adventuring party in the Sea of Fallen Stars. When the leaders of Spandeliyon asked for their help to defend the city from a pirate horde, they recruited more members and successfully defeated the pirates.
They decided to continued to act as mercenary group but always with the approach of an adventuring party. When the Horde menaced Faer√ªn, they decided to join the crusade of Azoun Obarskyr IV, being hired by Sembia. During the war they fought well but were decimated. The few survivors continued on as an adventuring party.
