The Undertakers were a bandit group based out of the Dungeon Level of Undermountain in the early 1490s DR.
The Undertakers were a group of failed actors and singers that posed as vampires and extorted tolls from gullible adventurers. They were at war with the Xanathars Thieves Guild.
In 1492 DR, the relationship between the gangs two leaders, Harria Valashtar and Uktarl Krannoc, had broken and the two started plotting to kill each other and become the only leader of the gang.
