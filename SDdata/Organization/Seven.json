        "mainbody": "he Seven were the first apprentices of Halaster Blackcloak who ventured with him into Undermountain. \n* Rantantar Described as dour man scarred by fire.\n* Marambra Nyghtsteel Said to be an evocation mage.\n* Trobriand Called \"the Metal Mage\", Trobriand had a gift for building metal constructs and monstrosities.\n* Muiral Called \"the Misshapen\", Muiral was originally a great warrior who served as Halasters bodyguard. He later became an apprentice to the Mad Mage and used his power to augment his considerable strength and fighting prowess. Finally, as the madness of Undermountain overcame him, he grafted his body onto a giant scorpion.\n* Arcturia Much like Muiral, Arcturias madness led her to experiment with bodies, both hers and others. Perhaps Halasters most ambitious apprentice, she was known for her cruel experiments with polymorphing others to suit her whims.\n* Jhesiyra Kestellharp For reasons unknown, Jhesiyra transformed herself into a living wish spell to escape from Halaster, but he brought her back to Undermountain. She later ruled over other living spells in Undermountains Citadel of the Bloody Hand. Driven half mad by her transformation, she ruled over the living spells the Mad Mage forced her to create, and it is uncertain whether she was truly aware of Halasters demise.\n* Nester A handsome man and necromancer.\nIn the , they abandoned Halasters Hold and moved into Undermountain.\nAs of 1372 DR, it was believed one of the Seven was dead, two others remained alive, and the fate of the others was still unknown. The two known to still be alive were Trobriand the Metal Mage and Muiral the Misshapen.\nShradin Mulophor Shradin was a powerful Netherese necromancer whod survived the collapse of his civilization. While he was not an original apprentice, in the , he learned of Sargauth Enclave and petitioned to become an apprentice to the Mad Mage. Halaster agreed and also allowed him to take the Enclave as his own. Shradin, calling himself the \"Lord of Bones\", turned the Enclave into Skullport, a neutral way-station permanently linking Undermountain to the Underdark."
