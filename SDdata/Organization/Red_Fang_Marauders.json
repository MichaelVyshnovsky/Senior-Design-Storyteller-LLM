        "mainbody": "he Red Fang Marauders, or simply the Red Fang, was a goblin and goblinoid tribe of marauding bandits, secretly allied with the Zhentarim, that menaced the Western Heartlands in the late 14 century DR.\nthumb|The marauders lair in the Trollbark Forest.\nIn the late 14 century DR, the Red Fang Marauders targeted the environs of Baldurs Gate, striking at traveling caravans from a base that was well hidden from the Gates guards. One of the marauders lairs was hidden in a cave within the Trollbark Forest from where they raided the Trade Way. One of the caravans that fell under the goblinoid attack was Randalla Brasshorns. She had led the caravan from Waterdeep to Baldurs Gate but it was attacked on the portion of the road south of Dragonspear Castle. That hideout was led by a goblin chieftain Bile-Tooth and housed kidnapped caravaners, including Randalla Brasshorn. Another goblin force set out for the Wayfork Village to pillage and ravage under the leadership of hobgoblin Harnak the Butcher.\nSerendipitously, a group of adventurers came across Keaira, Randallas caravan guard, and set out to find the Trollbark caves. Subsequently, they slew Bile-Tooth and freed the captured caravaners. Soon after, they defended Wayfork Village from the Red Fang Marauders and slew Harnak at the Wayfork Inn."
