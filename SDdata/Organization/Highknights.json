The rank of highknight was created around the time of Azoun Obarskyr IVs death in the .\nHighknights were charged with conducting important duties, such as rooting out traitors amidst the Purple Dragons or nobility. They would also guard the royalty or appropriate envoys. Highknights spoke with royal authority and had ready access to the royalty and court personnel. \nThe Highknights employed units that specialized in amphibious-combat, operating out of Marsember, and even abroad along the Dragon Coast, and dealt with anti-Cormyrean smuggling operations.\nHighknights were trained in etiquette and the laws of Cormyr, as well as the wielding of weapons. Most were trained as fighters, but the rank remained open to most other persons that could not be as easily placed into ordinary court hierarchies.\nHighknights were specially trained in evading attackers and protecting their targets. They could boast of a resilience to poison and a degree of resistance to magical spells.\nHighknights could be found practically anywhere, such as around the Dragonreach or on the Dragon Coast, but were most likely to be found in Cormyr itself.\nHighknights minds were regularly read by War Wizards to guarantee against treason, magical influence, and impersonation.\n* Beliard Cormaeril\n* Rowen Cormaeril\n* Targrael, a former highknight that was later raised as a death knight and mind-controlled by Manshoon"
