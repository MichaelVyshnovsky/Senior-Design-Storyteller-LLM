The Ministry of Secrets was found in the northern section of Dihliz in the mid–14 century DR.
The Ministry was tasked with cataloging all of the ancient ruins and treasure sites that lay between the Salt Jungle and Sempadan Forest and the border with the Cities of the Pantheon region. The organization was under constant review and restructuring, leading to many reports and scrolls being misfiled, stolen, or lost—though a sufficient bribe was often enough to produce any such lost item from the archives.
Amin Nur held the title of Minister of Secrets in 1367 DR.
