The '''Ministry of Secrets''' was found in the northern section of [[Dihliz]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|19}}

==Activities==
The Ministry was tasked with cataloging all of the ancient ruins and treasure sites that lay between the [[Salt Jungle]] and [[Sempadan Forest]] and the border with the [[Cities of the Pantheon]] region. The organization was under constant review and restructuring, leading to many reports and scrolls being misfiled, stolen, or lost—though a sufficient bribe was often enough to produce any such lost item from the archives.

==Members==
[[Amin Nur]] held the title of Minister of Secrets in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|17}}
