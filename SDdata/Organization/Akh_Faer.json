        "mainbody": "l troops in the Akh'Faer bear a ring identifying them as such and grants them resistance against magic as well as wands of ''detect magic''. Junior officers often are granted a complement of wands of such spells as ''magic missile'' or ''lightning bolt'', while senior officers might be given ''rods of absorption'' or ''rods of security''.\n\n===Tattoos===\nThe Akh'Faer, like the Akh'Velahr, use tattoos to signify rank.  All of the akh'faern wear black lightning sigils on the backs of their hands. As they become officers, they gain a large tattoo made up of azure lines and as they progress, up to four interlocking circles are added. Once a senior officer, yellow is added to the azure to make it green, and further up they gain concentric lozenges in black, intersecting with the circles.  Finally, a Spell-Major has all of his designs turned silver on green using the power of the Artblade or the painstaking skill of a tattoo artist.\n\nAll branches of the military are granted tattoos as medals in recognition of service as well.  Some of the common medals given to the members are the Akh'Aegis (for being seriously wounded in defense of the realm), Ister's Star (for an akh'faern who created and gifted a spell to the military), and the Crossed Swords (for any elf who fought [[drow]] and survived; some even chose to receive the tattoo a number of times for each drow slain).",
        "Heirarchy": "The Akh'Faer was mixed between the [[gold elves]] and the [[moon elves]]. They were composed of roughly three hundred primary troops (4th- 8th level [[wizards]]), one hundred junior officers (9th to 12th level wizards) and fifty senior officers (13th level or higher wizards) below the leadership. The leader of the Akh'Faer is called the [[Spell-Major]], and is chosen by ritual of [[blade-rite]], having been able to successfully draw the [[Artblade]]. A Spell-Major also names his four second in command, the [[Spell-Captain | Spell-Captains]]. Examine the table to the right to learn about the officer ranks in the Akh'Faer. To read the table, look at one rank to see what group is is a part of and how many troops he commands as part of that group.  For example, a Faerne is part of a Sphere, and commands Four Circles worth of troops (look further down to learn about a Circle).\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 5px 5px 5px 15px;\"\n|+ ''Officer Ranks in the Akh'Faer''\n!style=\"background-color:gray;color:white;\"|Officer Rank!!style=\"background-color:gray;color:white;\"|Group!!style=\"background-color:gray;color:white;\"|Troops Under Command\n|-\n|Faerniir||Ring||Four Troops\n|-\n|Faernil|| ||Two Rings\n|-\n|Faernaa||Circle||Four Rings\n|-\n|Faernos|| ||Two Circles\n|-\n|Faerne||Sphere||Four Circles\n|-\n|Faernae|| ||Two Spheres\n|-\n|Arfaern||Wing||Four Spheres\n|-\n|[[Spell-Captain]]||Flight||Two Wings\n|-\n|[[Spell-Major]]||Akh'Faer||Four Flights\n|}",
