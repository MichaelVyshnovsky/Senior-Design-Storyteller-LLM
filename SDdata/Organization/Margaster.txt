==Description==
The family had [[Illuskan]] heritage.

==Activities==
The Margasters engaged in overland trading of bulk goods, but also quietly practiced [[wizardry]].

==Base of Operations==
Their estate was located in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]], between [[Stabbed Sailor Alley]] and [[Shattercrock Alley]]. [[Thornhold]], a fortress located off the southern edge of the [[Mere of Dead Men]], was owned by the warlord [[Brunyundar Margaster]] until it was captured and claimed by a [[paladin]] as part of the [[Trollwars|Second Troll War]]. House Margaster continued to claim a right to Thornhold into the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

By the time of the [[War of the Silver Marches]], the Margasters owned property in [[Silverymoon]], including a three-story tower and a detached carriage house. Two [[cambion]]s guarded a stash of magical items in the carriage house, while [[Xamlyn Margaster]] resided in the tower.

==History==
By the time of the [[War of the Silver Marches]] of [[1485 DR]], several members of the Margaster family were secret worshipers of Asmodeus.

In [[1488 DR]], the Margaster family had allied with the [[drow]] of [[House Hunzrin]] and together managed a business of [[Demon|demonic]] [[phylacteries]].
