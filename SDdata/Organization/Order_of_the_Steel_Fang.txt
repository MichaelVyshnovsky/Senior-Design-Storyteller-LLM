The '''Order of the Steel Fang''' was an elite militant order within the church of [[Tempus]] was founded during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
Contingents of the order―known as Swords of the God―were led by members of the [[Tempuran church]] who had previously fought in many battles.

As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the order led by a council of these experienced warriors of Tempus.

==Activities==
The order's members were usually assigned to especially dangerous duties, such as bodyguard work or as protectors of holy [[relic]]s.

==History==
The order was founded in the {{YearlinkName|1352}}, by a group of adventuring [[Tempuran]] clerics known as the ''Steel Fang of the God''.{{Cite archive/Greenwood's Grotto/2023-07-06/Order of the Steel Fang}}

Over time, more and more Steel Fangs were conscripted into various non-religious conflicts throughout [[Chessenta]] and the [[Vilhon Reach]]. They earned great wealth for the church of Tempus but incited displeasure in both senior clergy and Tempus himself.

The conflicted nature of the order came to a head in the {{YearlinkName|1466}}, when Steel Fangs were conscripted to opposing sides of a conflict somewhere in the Realms. As members of the order slew each other in battle, Tempus grew so angry he appeared on the battlefield himself. He told his loyal Fangs: "Go home to your altars, and leave these leaderless folk to fight their own battles", before disappearing in a roar of thunder. Tempus' followers obeyed his command and the conflict came to an end. This event came to be known as The [[Tempuswrath]].

The [[1467 DR|following year]], the Order of the Steel Fang was repurposed as an internal disciplinary force, rather than soldiers for hire.
