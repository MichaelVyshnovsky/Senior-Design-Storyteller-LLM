The Sardonyx Knights were an order of crusaders devoted to Grumbar, the King of the Land Below the Roots.
Members of the order guarded Grumbars various holy sites against intruders and led any military operations sponsored by the Church of Grumbar. It fell to the crusaders to also punish any of Grumbars faithful who broke their sacred oaths.
