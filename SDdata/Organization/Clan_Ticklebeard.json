        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], Clan Ticklebeard had developed the ''Crazy Wilbur.'' The technique involved the [[returning]] dwarvish weapon [[enchantment]]. These enchanted weapons, like ''[[returning pike]]s'', were allowed or forced to be swallowed by their opponents. Then, the fighters called the returning weapons back, making the flight back as ready and messy as possible."
