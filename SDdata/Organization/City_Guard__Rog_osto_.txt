The City Guard of Rogosto served as a police force within the city as well as a standing army for the "City of Spires".
The composition of the city guard as of  was 1,000 infantry, 400 palace guards, and 200 jann. Additionally, each of the citys towers housed a personal guard of around 200 soldiers each.
The martial forces of Rogosto were extremely weak compared to every other city in Zakhara. However, the presence of so many powerful wizards made potential enemies think twice before attacking the city.
