The '''City Guard''' of the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free City]] of [[Utaqa]] served as a police force within the city as well as a standing army for the "City of Free Men".

==Organization==
The composition of the city guard as of {{Yearlink|1367}}{{AQ-time}} was 4,000 infantry, 10,000 [[mercenary barbarian]]s, and an impressive navy of 30 ships. Additionally, three units of [[mamluk]]s from the [[Studious Mamluk Society|Studious]], [[Valiant Mamluk Society|Valiant]], and [[Dutiful Mamluk Society|Dutiful Mamluk Societies]] were fortified upstream along [[Al-Zulma River]].<ref group="note">Page 84 of ''Adventurer's Guide to Zakhara'' from ''Land of Fate'' states the mamluks are stationed along Al-Kufr River, but this is believed to be an error since that river is 200 miles from Utaqa. The mamluks numbered 900 soldiers per unit.

==Activities==
Only about half of the mercenaries were present in the city at any given time, with the remainder patrolling the wilds surrounding the city. In theory, the mamluks were positioned strategically to offer aid during times of crisis, but their real orders from [[Qudra]] were to quell Utaqa should the inhabitants ever get out of hand.
