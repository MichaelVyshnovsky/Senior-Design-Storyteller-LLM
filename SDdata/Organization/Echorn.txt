The '''Echorn''' was an [[elven]] house of [[Myth Drannor]] that later migrated to [[Selu'Maraar]].{{cite book/Sea of Fallen Stars|153}}

==History==
House Echorn was one of the twelve First Houses of [[Myth Drannor|Cormanthor]], the fourth by seniority.

The clan supported the [[School of Arts]] in [[Semberholme]] since its founding in {{yearlink|212}}.{{cite book/Cormanthyr: Empire of the Elves|93}}

After the laying of the ''[[mythal]]'', the clan moved some of its members towards [[Semberholme]]. The rest moved to [[Selu'Maraar]] after the Fall of Myth Drannor.
