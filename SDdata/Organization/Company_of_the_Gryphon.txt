The '''Company of the Gryphon''' (also seen as the '''Company of the Griffon''') was an [[adventuring company]] active for a few hundred years{{Cite dragon/74/Seven Swords|22}} and later a mercenary company active in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were credited with discovering the lost dwarven city of [[Gauntlgrym]].
The original write-ups of ''Namarra'' cover events "Within the last five hundred years…" but key events were later dated to centuries earlier. As a result, the subsequent events seem spread out more than intended. This is evident with the Company of the Gryphon potentially being active for several centuries, rather than the original one century. Moreover, the story of ''Namarra'' calls the Company of the Gryphon "a band of adventurers", while ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Set'' declares them "a large... party of mercenaries". Thus, these may represent the same long-running adventuring/mercenary company or different companies operating under the same name in different eras. Nevertheless, the two are included here for completeness and ease of use.

==History==
===Early History===
At some point, the Company of the Gryphon killed a [[goblin]] wielding an [[enchanted]] sword named [[Ghaur]]. The company's then leader, the warrior named [[Flar]], claimed the sword and found it was the legendary ''[[Namarra]]'', the Sword that Never Sleeps, which the goblins of the [[Valley of Khedrun]] had looted in the plundering of [[Mirabar]] during the [[Goblin Wars]] in {{yearlink|753}}.It is unclear when this occurred. The sources say the goblins had the sword "for almost two hundred seasons", but it is unknown if this is meant to be 200 years (''e.g.'', 200 winters) or only 50 years (four seasons per year). Moreover, Namarra's timeline has been stretched by later dating, so it can only be some time between c. 800 DR or c. 950 DR and the 1270s DR. As the timeline is stretched, both presumed dates are difficult to fit—Flar may have the sword for up to ~470 or ~320 years and seems very long-lived.

Later, to pay for training in the combat arts, Flar gave ''Namarra'' to [[Thulmar One-Eye]] of [[Port Llast]] around the 1270s DR.

===Gauntlgrym===
In the mid-1300s DR, an unidentified person in [[Waterdeep]] had discovered the location of the lost [[dwarf|dwarven]] city of [[Gauntlgrym]], reputed to contain much magic and wealth. To explore it on his behalf, he hired the Company of the Gryphon, then a mercenary company numbering thirty members. On their expedition, they found a decaying entrance to the dwarf hold in a high hidden valley. However, only three members returned, having fled the company soon after..

These three made it back to Waterdeep early in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}. and the Company of the Gryphon were credited with discovering Gauntlgrym that year. They began spending prodigiously on new weapons and armor for another expedition. Meanwhile, several Waterdeep-based adventurers began investigating, not only the location of the entrance to Gauntlgrym but also the fates of the rest of the Company of the Gryphon and the identity of the one who'd sent them to their dooms. Answers, however, remained unknown as of [[Ches]] of that year.

Nevertheless, either a week or a season later, the survivors returned to Gauntlgrym to retrieve its treasures, and did not return, not that year nor the next, nor a decade since.

The [[Knights of Myth Drannor]] would later re-discover Gauntlgrym by [[1358 DR]], and survived.<ref>
