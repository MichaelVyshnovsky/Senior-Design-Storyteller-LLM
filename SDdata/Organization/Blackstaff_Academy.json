        "mainbody": "'''Blackstaff Academy''' was a loosely organized group of elite apprentices and students who studied under the [[Blackstaff]] at [[Blackstaff Tower]] in the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].",
        "Organization": "The Blackstaff served as the master/mistress of the school, under whom trained senior apprentices who were responsible for most of the day-to-day running of the academy, including the conducting of lessons for junior students, as well as the defense of the Academy against monsters and hostile [[mage]]s.",
        "Activities": "The school trained [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s who sought to learn from the Blackstaff,\n\nStudying under the purview of the Blackstaff offered students access to some rare or even unique [[spell]]s designed by the Blackstaff or other notable members of the Academy, including ''[[blackstaff (spell)|blackstaff]]'', ''[[Khelben's dweomerdoom]]'', ''[[Khelben's suspended silence]]'', ''[[Laeral's cutting hand]]'', and ''[[Laeral's silver lance]]''.\n\nIt was a priority to make sure that no student was treated badly or was not given the opportunity to keep busy with studies. This was done to ensure that graduates would continue to regard the Academy as allies, and so even when an apprentice decided to leave, the Academy helped them to establish themselves in their new endeavors. As of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], this strategy had proven to be effective at minimizing any treachery within the school.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Academy operated out of Blackstaff Tower, These areas included multiple libraries and laboratories.\n\nThe role of protecting the Tower fell to the senior apprentices, who were always well-trained in [[Abjuration|defensive magics]].",
        "History": "The school was founded following the arrival of [[Laeral Silverhand]] to live at Blackstaff Tower with the original Blackstaff, [[Khelben Arunsun]], in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}. Magic practitioners flocked to seek apprenticeship under the two legendary mages, and as those apprentices took on their own students in turn, they formed an elite yet makeshift and informal school that came to be known as Blackstaff Academy. In those initial years, Khelben and Laeral held the titles of master and mistress of the school. and as of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Laeral had assumed most of the administrative duties of the Academy, which boasted 54 students and apprentices.\n\nWizards continued to train with the Academy after Khelben's death and into the late 15{{th}} century DR when [[Vajra Safahr]] took up the mantle of Blackstaff in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. and made it her mission to see the Academy become the center of magical studies in [[Faer√ªn]], even pursuing multiple plans at once to make this a reality. She was known to roam the Academy wearing [[Pillars of Knowledge|magically silent boots]], which allowed her both to avoid disrupting the apprentices' studies or to make a sudden appearance for a pop quiz or to provide crucial insight. She was rumored to invite particularly talented apprentices to read and copy spells from her own [[spellbook]], and sometimes extended the even greater honor of having them add a spell of their own invention to it.\n\nAt one point during Laeral Silverhand's tenure as [[Open Lord]] of Waterdeep in the late 15{{th}} century DR, a group of [[adventurer]]s in her service recovered a sample of ''[[Frostsilver armor]]'' from [[Frostsilver Mines]], and sent it to the Academy at Laeral's behest in hopes that the students would be able to learn its secrets.",
