The Black Eagle coster was a trading company whose headquarters, little more than a warehouse, was located on the eastern side of Ashabenford in late 14 century DR. They would purchase locally made food stuffs like grain, cheese, ale and salted meats and sell them out in Hillsfar, Harrowdale and Scardale, to be sold and shipped overseas.
The companys ownership consisted of a five-man partnership of former adventurers led by the swordsman Iletian Blackeagle.
