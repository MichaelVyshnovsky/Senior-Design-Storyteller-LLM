The '''Foulwater''' tribe was a group of [[goblin]]s that laired within the [[Twilight Marsh]] of the [[Moonsea North]] for a time during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The tribe's leadership was taken over by a particularly large [[bugbear]] named [[Gorrunk]].{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|13}} It was estimated the Foulwater tribe included dozens, if not several hundred goblinoid members.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|14}}

==Activities==
They spent much of their time raiding and only a few scant members remained within their den in the marsh.

==Base of Operations==
The Foulwater goblins operated out of a cave system in the Twilight Marsh, the entrance of which was protected by a tripwire trap.

==Relationships==
They kept several pet [[wolves]] within their underground home.

==History==
The tribe moved into a cave some time in the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} after the [[black dragon]] that previously claimed it as its lair was slain by [[adventurer]]s. Not long later, the reborn [[Cult of the Dragon]] came to investigate and wound up slaying many of the Foulwater goblins.{{Cite adventurers league/Defiance in Phlan|12}}

In the end, the goblins and cultists came to an agreement. The goblins would allowed to remain within the dragon's old cave, so long as they exclusively sold to the cult any items of interest found within.
