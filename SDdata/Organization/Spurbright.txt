'''Spurbright''' was a noble house of [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
The Spurbrights had a seat in [[Espar]], and owned 20 or so miles of tenanted farms north of Espar along either side of the [[Way of The Dragon]]. Their heraldry contained a circle of four crowns at its heart, referencing the legend of the [[Four Floating Crowns]].

[[Thaelder]] was the house wizard of the Spurbright family in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Secretly, like many of house wizards that served Cormyrean noble houses, was a [[War Wizard]] who used his magics to monitor the family.

==Notable Members==
* [[Aglara Spurbright]], a family member who fell afoul of the [[Four Floating Crowns]].
* [[Delandra Spurbright]], wife of Elvarr, mother of Torsard.
* [[Elvarr Spurbright]], the patriarch of the Spurbrights ''circa'' [[1348 DR]] who conspired against the [[Obarskyr]] royal family.
* [[Torsard Spurbright]], Elvarr's son and avid [[falcon]]er.
