        "mainbody": "The Most Careful Order of Skilled Smiths & Metalforgers was a guild of blacksmiths and metalworkers operating out of the city of Waterdeep.\nThe Master of the guild was both the leader of the Order, and the primary point of contact for those wanting to make contact with the group as a whole, or wishing to join. The guild imported, and provided its members with the raw materials needed for their crafts. They also made the tools that their members required for their work, either renting or selling them, while ensuring they remained well-maintained.\nGuildmembers were always busy, crafting everyday metal objects, such as brackets, chains, hinges, horseshoes, latches, needles, and the like. They were also responsible for crafting simple weapons such as hammers and maces.\nIn business, the guild prided themselves in being able to design efficient, yet elegant items produce their crafts quickly and, when required, replicate those designs with exacting precision.\nThe guildhouse, named Metalmasters Hall, was a large, three-story building in Southern Ward on the eastern side of the High Road, near the magical signpost known as the Waymoot.\nMembers tended to be people who were very strong and hardy, with impressive tolerances for the heat and din of the forge. They had to pay thirty dragons to join the guild, and paid a further twenty in annual dues.\nMembers wore a uniform consisting of red tunics with a black hammer (head at the top of a vertical handle) on the breast, and gray caps with black plumes."
