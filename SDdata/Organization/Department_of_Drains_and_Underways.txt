The '''Department of Drains and Underways''' was a civic organization managed by [[Baldur's Gate]] that maintained the city's underway and [[Baldur's Gate/Sewers|sewers]].

==Activities==
The Department of Drains and Underways employed a tribe of gutter [[kobold]]s to perform some maintenance work on the city's street hatches, drainage, and maintaining flow in the underground sanitation tunnels, however, the tribe was reported slain by an unknown perpetrator during the [[Absolute crisis]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the [[Cult of the Absolute]] infiltrated the walls of Baldur's Gate whilst allied with the [[Church of Bhaal|cult of Bhaal]]. [[Orin the Red]], the crazed [[Chosen]] of the Lord of Murder, and her [[doppelganger]]s performed ritualistic murders of Baldurians, using as a base their so-called Tribunal, deep under the Lower City. [[Gohumberry Tresp]] of the Lower City grew suspicious of the rising stench of death that emanated from the City Sewers' drains and hatches. Gohumberry began investigating the scandalous issue and petitioned the Department of Drains and Underways for a resolution to the problem. The Department claimed to be handling the problem and sternly warned Gohumberry away from attempting to enter the Underways on his own.
