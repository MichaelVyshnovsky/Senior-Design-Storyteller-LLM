The Sisterhood of the Oaks were a mercenary company based in the Chondalwood around 1358 DR.
They were a group of rangers who fought during the war against the arcanaloth Yrkhetep.
The Sisterhood were female trackers, archers, and scouts. They were all vegetarians, never harming fish, birds, and other "children of nature".
The Sisterhood took 1 gold piece for a day for each member. Usually they acted as escorts or scouts, or as a special attack force.
