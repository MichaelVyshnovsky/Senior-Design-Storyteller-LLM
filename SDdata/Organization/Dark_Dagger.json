        "mainbody": "The Dark Dagger was a widespread group of Vhaeraun-worshiping drow. \nIn the 14th century DR, the Dark Dagger was active in Skullport, Turmish, the Vilhon Reach, Amn, and Calimshan and were expanding to other cities around the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nThe Dark Dagger was led by drow males but recruited humans and half-elves as well. Members of the Dark Dagger used poisons to which they were immune, resulting from prolonged and controlled exposure.\nIt seemed that common members or cells were called Points and the leaders held the title Envenomed Edge.\nIn 1359 DR, in the course of the Darkstalker Wars, the Dark Dagger in Skullport suffered an attack by assassins hired by Ralan el Pesarkhal. This attack caused casualties that numbered half of the Skullport cells members and made it impossible to send money and material supplies to their southern fellows. This interruption caused their bid to gain control over Calimshans underworld to fail. \nThe groups in Calimshan and Skullport were in serious danger of collapsing but their state of weakness didnt last. The Skullport cell saw a change in leadership and was rebuilt after under Malakuth Tabuirr, becoming a major power in Skullport, while the cell in Calimshan rebuilt their influence under Masoj Naerth.\nAfter the death of Victor Dhostar in 1367 DR, the Dark Dagger attempted to secretly take control of the Night Masks but failed, thus earning their enmity.\nThe Dark Dagger sought to establish themselves as the masters of the criminal world in the region around the Inner Sea lands. Their modus operandi was to first infiltrate and eventually become the de facto rulers of such groups.\nAs a religious order, they also founded temples and drew dissatisfied humanoids (humans and half-elves) to their faith by using the similarities of Masks and Vhaerauns symbols as an entry.\nAs mentioned above, the Dark Dagger was a widespread group. They were active to various degrees in Turmish, Amn, Calimshan, Vilhon Reach, and also in Skullport.\nThe cell numbered about 80–90 members with a ratio of 13 in favor of non-drow members. While the cell had only about 20 actual drow members (out of whom about six were part of Vhaerauns priesthood), the majority of Vhaeraun followers in Skullport was affiliated with the Dark Dagger.\nUnder the leadership of Malakuth Tabuirr, they dealt in legal but more often than not in illegal goods and services and even their legal business had a shady taint. but also as assassins.\nMalakuth Tabuirr was a member of the Iron Ring, a slaver ring for mutual protection and the most influential in the field, but Dark Daggers field of expertise was the smuggling business.\nThe Dark Dagger dealt in poisons, alcohol, weapons and armors, through routes leading into and out of Waterdeep, and vice versa. They favored female elf and human slaves. While it wasnt clear to whom the slaves were sold to, it was suspected that the buyers were denizens of drow cities.\nTraders from outside Skullport were also targets of extortion and their goods were targets for theft, with traders from Calimshan being the favored targets to disrupt.\nA religious enemy of the Dark Dagger were followers of Lolth. In Skullport, the foremost Lolthite organization was House TanorThal of Karsoluthiyl, which was a contender in the trading field. The Dark Dagger undermined the Houses economic activities and power by raiding their caravans, because prolonged long-term conflicts were prohibited by the Skulls of Skullport. Despite losing both lives and property to the Dark Dagger, House TanorThal never managed to understand that the Dark Dagger were behind these attacks.\n* Amryyr Yauntyrr Scholar and courier.\n* Malakuth Tabuirr Leader of the Dark Dagger in Skullport and member of the Iron Ring circa 1370 DR.\n* Masoj Naerth Leader of the Dark Dagger in Calimshan.\nCategoryThieves guilds\nCategoryAssassins guilds\nCategorySlaving organizations\nCategoryOrganizations in Skullport\nCategoryOrganizations in Undermountain\nCategoryOrganizations on the Sword Coast North\nCategoryOrganizations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Turmish\nCategoryOrganizations in the Vilhon Reach\nCategoryOrganizations in Westgate\nCategoryOrganizations on the Dragon Coast\nCategoryOrganizations on the Sea of Fallen Stars\nCategoryOrganizations in Interior Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Amn\nCategoryOrganizations in Calimshan\nCategoryOrganizations in the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryOrganizations in West Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\nCategoryOrganizations in the Eastern Heartlands\n1tbbyteii6qmhyg4g2mv0cezqnj45a8"
