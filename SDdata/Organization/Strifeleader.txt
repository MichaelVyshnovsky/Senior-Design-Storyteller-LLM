'''Strifeleaders''', or as they referred themselves '''the Sworn''', were the [[specialty priest]]s of the deity [[Cyric]]. They were charged with sowing discord and chaos across the Realms in order to grow the faith of the Dark Sun. They spread what they referred to as the "One True Way" of their god's faith.

==Activities==
When they weren't propagating fear and mistrust among those outside of their faith, Strifeleaders often plotted against other [[Cyricist]]s, to increase their own personal standing.

Strifeleaders were adept at utilizing and seeing through subversion. As to be expected they were adept at lying to others, even in the face of certain [[spell]]s used to discern the truth. Similarly, Strifleaders could withstand [[magic]]al ''[[fear]]'' effects and were adept at seeing through ''[[illusion]]'' magic.

Many of them were skilled in the utilization of various [[poison]]s.

As they grew in personal power, they gained access a few [[divine magic|divine spell]]s unique to their faith, including: ''[[black talon]]'', ''[[dread blast]]'', ''[[skull of secrets]]'',  ''[[triple mask]]'', and ''[[create direguard]]''. 

==Tactics==
They often involved themselves in the courts of corrupt or malevolent rulers, particularly those who sought to increase their own power by any means necessary.

==Base of Operations==
In the first decade of their existence, Strifeleaders and the other faithful of Cyric maintained their headquarters in [[Zhentil Keep]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, there were few priests wholly dedicated to Cyric. However at that time the number was growing rapidly.

==Notable Members==
* [[Dag Zoreth]]: This 14{{th}} century Cyricist [[priest]] operated out of [[Darkhold]] keep alongside [[Malchior]].
