        "History": "The Emveolstone family was originally from [[Tethyr]] and they were ennobled in Waterdeep in the {{YearlinkName|1205}}. They maintained close ties to Tethyr, in particular the marriage between Lord [[Ortaal Emveolstone]] and the Tethyrian Princess [[Cyralna Emveolstone|Cyralna]], but lesser nobles of the family got embroiled in treachery, bringing shame and condemnation to the family and causing a rift between the [[Sword Coast]] nation and the City of Splendors.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1274}}, Cyralna was due to give birth to her first child. Her brother, Prince [[Toram (prince)|Toram]], two younger sisters, and five young nieces made the journey to Waterdeep to celebrate the happy occasion. Ortaal's sister [[Evelyn Emveolstone|Evelyn]] found Toram to be a kindred spirit and they became lovers. She fanned the flames of his desire to become king of Tethyr and they plotted to remove other family members that could block Toram's succession. When Cyralna and the baby were tragically lost during childbirth, they convinced Ortaal's brother [[Kyvan Emveolstone|Kyvan]] that the two princesses that were Cyralna's midwives actually caused their deaths in order to remove potential rivals for the throne. Toram and Kyvan then acquired young [[mimic]]s and placed them in the bedchambers of all seven princesses, killing all of them in one fell swoop.\n\nLord Kyvan and Prince Toram were proven by investigators to be the culprits of this perfidy, but Evelyn managed to avoid being implicated. King [[Errilam I]] requested they be executed as traitors and the two men were drawn and quartered and their remains were left to rot on the gates of Waterdeep and [[Zazesspur]] respectively. Lady Evelyn withdrew from society for many years but her enmity towards the royal [[House of Tethyr]] over the death of her beloved Toram only festered. In the {{YearlinkName|1288}}, Princess [[Shaerglynda]], a niece of Toram, was in Waterdeep as part of a trade convoy. Lady Evelyn hired an assassin to kill the princess and make it look like a robbery. She again escaped notice as the instigator, but she unwisely kept a signet ring while disposing the rest of the princess' jewelry through discrete contacts.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1295}}, Lady Evelyn hired a large group of mercenaries through multiple layers of intermediaries to ambush and slay King [[Jaszur]] of Tethyr, who was trying to rebuild a relationship with [[Open Lord]] [[Baeron]] of Waterdeep. The attack succeeded and Evelyn came into possession of the crown jewels and regalia of Tethyr. But this time, a captured brigand provided enough information to trace the jewels back to House Emveolstone and Evelyn was quietly arrested on strong suspicion. The signet ring proved she was involved in the death of Princess Shaerglynda, and further investigation finally brought to light much of her behind-the-scenes treachery over the previous two decades. The crown jewels were recovered and Lady Evelyn was beheaded in [[Castle Waterdeep]], witnessed only by Lord Baeron and Lord Ortaal.",
