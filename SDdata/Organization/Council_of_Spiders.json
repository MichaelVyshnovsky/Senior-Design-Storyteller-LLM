        "mainbody": "he Council of Spiders was an organization of drow wizards who sought representation on the Ruling Council of Menzoberranzan in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the late 15 century DR, minor wizards of various noble houses of Menzoberranzan (most prominently House Xorlarrin and House Barrison DelArmgo) formed the Council of Spiders to gain seats on the Ruling Council alongside the priestesses of Lolth.\nRaelaryn Xorlarrin, one of the Councils elders, invited his cousin Hoshtar to a meeting in the ruins of House SruneLetts compound in Narbondellyn. During the meeting, Raelaryn and an elder from House Barrison DelArmgo were killed by Merinid Dalael, an assassin from the Jaezred Chaulssin, and Hoshtar was taken captive. Adventurers in the employ of House Xorlarrin, House Melarn, and Bregan Daerthe arrived looking for the prisoner, resulting in a fight with the Council of Spiders. However, the adventurers defeated Merinid and rescued Hoshtarr, discovering the assassins plot.\nThe Council also set up a meeting with the Archmage of Menzoberranzan, Gromph Baenre.\nBy 1486 DR, the Council was sponsored by renegade archmage Vizeran DeVir and they supported him in plots against the matron mothers.\nElders of the Council of Spiders included Raelaryn Xorlarrin and a low-ranking noble of House Barrison DelArmgo. Other members from House Xorlarrin were senior wizards Filraen and Nym Brael and junior wizards Krenaste and Tarlyn."
