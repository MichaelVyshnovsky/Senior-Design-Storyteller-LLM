An Elder Concord was a ruling body in illithid society made up of individual Creed representatives.
The members of Elder Concords were Creedmasters, each who represented their Creed.
Each Elder Concord in a society was tasked with rulership responsibilities. However, the societys elder brain could propose its own plans and even decide the action taken by the Elder Concord, should they be undecided.
Elder Concords were responsible for electing officials in illithid community, such as quastors (finance and trade officials), vigileators (security officials), and aedileators (general officials).
When a circumstance required the attention of more than one mind flayer society, the individual Elder Concords would come together as a Grand Elder Concord. The Grand Elder Concord was a temporary body, and would be dissolved after the affairs were dealt with.
For meetings, Elder Concords gathered around a platform that surrounded the societys elder brain.
In the 14 century DR, Thalynsar the Ulithautarch the foresaw that a Grand Elder Concord would rule Toril. Thalynsar anticipated that all elder brains would merge with ulitharids in order to achieve this.
