The '''Ironseth''' family was a [[human]] [[Amn]]ian mercantile family of [[Amnwater]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The Ironseths focused on [[horse]] training and the hiring and training of [[mercenaries]], and owned more than half of the land around Amnwater. Together with the [[Wheelarit]]s and [[Yhliivast]]s, they managed to corner the economic and political power in Amnwater around [[1320 DR]] and proceeded to effectively operate the town as an oligarchy.

==Members==
* Lord [[Ghaark Ironseth]], the family leader in 1370 DR.
* [[Togar Ironseth]], Ghaark's third son.
