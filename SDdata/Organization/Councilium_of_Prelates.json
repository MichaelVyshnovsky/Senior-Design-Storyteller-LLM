        "Organization": "The Councilium was made up of the [[priest|high priest]]s of each of Saelmur's seven largest faiths&mdash;the [[Church of Chauntea]], the [[Church of Helm]], the [[Church of Ilmater]], the [[Church of Lathander]], the [[Church of Oghma]], the [[Church of Torm]], and the [[Church of Tyr]].",
        "History": "Around the later 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a frequent topic of discussion during the Councilium's meetings was the [[Knights of the Black Gauntlet]]. and the neighboring city-state of [[Kzelter]] since [[1370 DR]].<ref> Many within the Councilium felt that war between Saelmur and the Knights was inevitable, but could not agree on how to approach the situation. The leader of the Church of Torm felt that they should strike soon, even threatening to wage an attack with just his own forces, while the leader of the Church of Tyr felt that the Saelmurrans had no chance of facing the Knights' forces without outside aid.",
