The '''Cult of Jathiman''', also called the '''Jathimites''', were an ancient cult of [[Netherese]] origin. They hated all the [[god]]s and their works, and were most known for crafting the ''[[Jathiman Dagger]]''.

==Dogma==
The Jathimites bore an intense hatred of deities and all aspects of the divine. They believed that, through sheer brute force, mortals could even bring down and kill the gods.

==History==
By weaving [[arcane magic]] through violent self-destruction—in the actual self-sacrifice of thirty-nine Jathimites—they manifested these forces in physical form, crafting the ''Jathiman Dagger''. It was designed to slay the gods themselves.

They would not get to savor their creation for long. The god [[Jergal]], Lord of the End of Everything, caused the slaughter of the whole surviving sect in grisly fashion. He trapped the remaining 149 Jathimites in a great coliseum where he slowly imploded and then reanimated them as [[ghoul]]s who would devour the others, and forced them to watch each other's fates in horror and hunger. Afterward, he took the ''Jathiman Dagger'' for himself.Although this is undated, the account on page 46 of ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'' references the Cult of Jathiman and has the ''Jathiman Dagger'' used after the fall of Netheril in {{Yearlink|-339}} and presumably before the destruction of [[Jhaamdath]] in {{Yearlink|-255}}, placing the Cult some time before the latter date.
