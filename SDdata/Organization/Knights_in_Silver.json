        "mainbody": "The '''Knights in Silver''' were the army of [[Silverymoon]] and it was their duty to patrol and defend the city against [[orc]]s and other dangers.",
        "Organization": "As of [[1372 DR]], the commander of the Knights in Silver was [[Sernius Alathar]].",
        "Base of Operations": "A dozen Knights in Silver guarded [[Hawk's Nest]], the watchtower near the top of [[Silverymoon Pass]] during the months when the [[Silverymoon Pass road|road]] from Silverymoon to [[Sundabar]] was in heavy use protecting the road's traffic from monsters and bandits.",
        "Relationships": "They were aided by many [[wizard]]s and contingents of [[Harper agent]]s.",
        "History": "The Knights in Silver were led by [[Besnell]] of Silverymoon, an [[elven]] [[fighter]] up until his death in the war between [[Mithral Hall]] and [[Menzoberranzan]]. After the war was won he was replaced by his second in command [[Terrien Doucard]], a [[half-elf]] soldier from Silverymoon. Later, Terrien led [[Stumpet Rakingclaw]], the [[dwarven]] high priestess of Mithral Hall to save the injured [[Alustriel|Lady Alustriel]] higher up on the slopes of [[Keeper's Dale]]. \n\nThe Knights in Silver contributed some of their soldiers to the [[Army of the North]], when the threat of the [[phaerimm]] appeared before the Silver Marches and the surrounding lands in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, during the [[War of the Silver Marches]], a contingent of the Knights in Silver led by Aleina Brightlance were sent to help King [[Firehelm]] in defending [[Sundabar]] from the oncoming forces of the [[Many-Arrows]]. They attempted to repel them at the [[River Redrun]], but with [[frost giant|frost giants]] and the [[drow]] forces of [[Ravel Xorlarrin]] aiding the orcs the Knights in Silver were ultimately overwhelmed and suffered heavy casualties. In the days that followed many people referred to the defeat as a slaughter.",
        "Members": {
            "Recruitment": "There were two ways of becoming a Knight in Silver: volunteering, or receiving a commission from the High Mage. The former was by far the more common method. When volunteering for duty an aspirant presented themselves to the Recruiting Master [[Mazillor Shatterstave]] in the city of Silverymoon. Master Shatterstave received applicants only once a month, so if an aspirant missed the recruiting period they must wait til the next month to apply again.",
