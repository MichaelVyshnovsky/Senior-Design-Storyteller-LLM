The vremyonni or Old Ones were an arcane brotherhood in Rashemen.
Men that were arcane spellcasters in Rashemen had two choices, exile or to join the vremyonni. Many vremyonni were kept alive for eons by longevity magic.
Vremyonni were expert weaponsmiths and magic item creators.
On very rare occasions, vremyonni would fight in the defense of Rashemen.
Vremyonni used secrets of magic that even the Witches of Rashemen did not use, destructive spells forbidden among the wilds of Rashemen, in case such magic was needed.
The Running Rocks harbored secret strongholds of the vremyonni. 
All vremyonni wore masks.
