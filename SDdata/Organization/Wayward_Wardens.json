        "mainbody": "The '''Wayward Wardens''' were a loosely organized group of [[halfling]] [[paladin]]s, [[cleric]]s, and [[ranger]]s that served [[Yondalla]], the Nurturing Matriarch and leader of the [[halfling pantheon]].",
        "Organization": "The Wayward Wardens were a fellowship of halflings that indulged their wanderlust and roamed [[Faerûn]] without settling in one place for long periods of time. Their mission was to protect and serve hin communities that were threatened by outside forces or events until such time when their services were no longer needed. They journeyed alone or in groups, patrolling roads and safeguarding settlements.",
        "Activities": "Some forty Wardens took up temporary residence with the hin of the [[Purple Hills]] during the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]] and were instrumental in preventing the violence that swept through the [[human]] community from spilling over onto their brethren.",
        "Tactics": "In a group of Wardens, those with stealthy skills would often split off and remain hidden while the rest boldly approached a situation. This allowed for surprise, rapid reinforcement, or preventing the escape of perpetrators."
