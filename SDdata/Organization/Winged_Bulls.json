        "mainbody": "The Winged Bulls were a faction within the Everlasting in 1367 DR.\nThe Winged Bulls were based in the fortress of Sarahin located deep within the Haunted Lands.\nGenerally speaking, the Winged Bulls were the most unpolished members of the Everlasting. Most of the time the tasks they were assigned were designed simply to keep them from hindering the other members of the Everlasting in their work.\nThey were eager and fanatical, but lacked the necessary skills to rise within the ranks.\nThe Winged Bulls were led by Nusrah bin Kerim.\nThe true leader of the Winged Bulls, Aida al-Irrahman, was busy in Qudra spreading propaganda."
