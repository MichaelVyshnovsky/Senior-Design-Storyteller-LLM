The individual Naug-adar were usually assigned by the Zhent to spying and eavesdroppings missions. They performed other missions in order to advantage the Black Network, such as killing enemies, manipulate people and events or discover important secrets. Usually they used most of their time and resources to try and sabotage their superiors.\nThey could be promoted to enter the Zhentarim ranks only if they demonstrated some initiative. Usually, the Naug-adar would deal with information following this pattern good news were always reported to superiors, while bad news were systematically buried if such news had no apparent utility, there was the possibility that the member would keep them for themselves, hoping to use them to rise up the ranks one day. The Naug-adar died in large numbers during the Fall of Zhentil Keep but the organization survived. Some Naug-adar fought in Shadowdale in 1375 as members of the Zhentarim Occupation Army"
