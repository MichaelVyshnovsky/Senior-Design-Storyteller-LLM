            "Initial Councilors": "* Harbin Wester, a [[banker]] and formerly the sole Townmaster of Phandalin. He prioritized the prosperity of the town.\n* [[Sildar Hallwinter]], a former soldier and adventurer. He prioritized the security of the town's mining and trade.\n* [[Trilena Stonehill]], co-owner of the [[Stonehill Inn]]. She was elected by the town's longtime residents to represent their interests.",
            "Councilors in 1496 DR": "* Harbin Wester, who relied on rhetoric accusing adventurers of his prior failures in order to pursue the newly created role of mayor.\n* Sildar Hallwinter, who prioritized the town's safety and opposed Wester in the mayoral election.\n* [[Halia Thornton]], the head of the [[Phandalin Miner's Exchange]]. She mysteriously disappeared prior to the mayoral election."
