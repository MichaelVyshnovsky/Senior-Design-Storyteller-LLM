The '''Rus''' were an [[Illuskan]] tribe.

==History==
Many centuries before the 14{{th}} century DR, the Rus raided much of coastal [[Faer√ªn]], with some bands even sailing the rivers further inland.

In {{YearlinkName|-105}}, a group of Rus led by chieftain [[Yvengi (chieftain)|Yvengi]] were transported onto the eastern shore of [[Lake Ashane]] in [[Raumathar]] by way of a malfunctioning ''[[portal]]'' in the [[Whalebones]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes}}<ref group="note">In ''[[Volo's Guide to All Things Magical]]'', the Rus are described as having arrived in Rashemen by way of a chain of lakes and rivers, but this was contradicted in the later ''[[Champions of Ruin]]'' and ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'', which state that their arrival was the result of a malfunctioning ''[[portal]]''. The Rus integrated with the native [[Rashemi]] of the region, and their presence was credited with sparking the insurrection that would displace [[Eltab]] in {{YearlinkName|-75}}, led by the half-Rus and half-Rashemi warrior hero also named [[Yvengi]].
