The '''Bounty Hunters of Cavus Dun''', often known as the '''Bounty Hirelings of Cavus Dun''' or simply as '''Cavus Dun''', were renowned mercenaries from [[Netheril]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].The novel ''Charon's Claw'' twice refers to the organization as "Bounty Hirelings of Cavus Dun" (pp. 22 and 35 of the hardcover edition, in chapters 1 and 2), but this name seems in error, as 'hirelings' implies a lowly employee or mercenary, which is at odds with their high reputation and 'bounty hirelings' makes little sense. They are also referred to "Bounty Hunters of Cavus Dun" (p. 24, chapter 1), which is more appropriate for their occupation. Otherwise, they are generally known simply as "Cavus Dun" but it's unknown what this is.
 
==Organization==
Members of the mercenary group were not considered Netherese nobles, but were considered above commoners.

The leader of Cavus Dun was called the Grandfather.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1463}}, a group of Cavus Dun members were hired by [[Effron]] to capture [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] and kill [[Drizzt Do'Urden]]. They failed in their task, in no small part because Ambergris turned on the group and defected to Drizzt's side, taking Afafrenfere with her.

==Notable Members==
* [[Afafrenfere]]: A male [[human]] [[monk]] and member of the [[Brothers of the Gray Mists]].
* [[Ambergris (person)|Ambergris]]: A female [[dwarf]], who was not fully converted to the Shadovar.
* [[Glorfathel]]: An [[elf]] Shadovar [[wizard]].
* [[Jermander]]: A [[tiefling]] shade, killed by [[Artemis Entreri]] in 1463 DR.
* [[Parbid]]: A tiefling monk, member of the Brothers of the Gray Mists.
* [[Ratsis]]: A human male shade, known for his spiders.
