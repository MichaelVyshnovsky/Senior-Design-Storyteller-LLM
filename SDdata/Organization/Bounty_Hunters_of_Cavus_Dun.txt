The Bounty Hunters of Cavus Dun, often known as the Bounty Hirelings of Cavus Dun or simply as Cavus Dun, were renowned mercenaries from Netheril in the 15 century DR.The novel Charons Claw twice refers to the organization as "Bounty Hirelings of Cavus Dun" (pp. 22 and 35 of the hardcover edition, in chapters 1 and 2), but this name seems in error, as hirelings implies a lowly employee or mercenary, which is at odds with their high reputation and bounty hirelings makes little sense. They are also referred to "Bounty Hunters of Cavus Dun" (p. 24, chapter 1), which is more appropriate for their occupation. Otherwise, they are generally known simply as "Cavus Dun" but its unknown what this is.
Members of the mercenary group were not considered Netherese nobles, but were considered above commoners.
The leader of Cavus Dun was called the Grandfather.
In the , a group of Cavus Dun members were hired by Effron to capture Dahlia Sinfelle and kill Drizzt DoUrden. They failed in their task, in no small part because Ambergris turned on the group and defected to Drizzts side, taking Afafrenfere with her.
