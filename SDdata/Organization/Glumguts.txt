The '''Glumguts''' were an extended family of [[dark one]]s&mdash;predominantly [[dark creeper]]s&mdash;that operated in the [[Shadowfell]] city of [[Evernight]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The Glumguts were paid by the [[Netheril#Empire_of_Shadows|Empire of Netheril]] to maintain their Evernight consulate at the so-called [[dark creeper enclave]]. In practice, this simply meant receiving messages for the Netherese and ensuring that the consulate was a safe place for visiting [[shadovar]]. The Glumguts were not granted any formal authority under this relationship, and the Netherese would destroy them if they did anything that embarrassed or weakened Netheril's interests in Evernight.

To supplement their income, the Glumguts engaged in banditry outside Evernight's walls and along the [[Shadowfell Road]], and would steal from any living visitors to the city.

==Members==
As of {{Yearlink|1479}}, the Glumguts were led by a [[dark stalker]] known as [[Blackclaw (dark stalker)|Blackclaw]], who was feared among their ranks for his cruelty.

Other notable members included Blackclaw's son, [[Blackcut]], and his cousins, [[Thrax]] and [[Vynnia]]. These three were known to engage in pranks across Evernight, and were the only ones brave enough to test Blackclaw's patience, largely because they believed that Blackcut's relationship with his father would protect them. As of 1479 DR, the three had engaged in acts that had worsened Netheril's reputation in the city, but Blackclaw had not yet found out.
