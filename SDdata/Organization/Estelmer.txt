'''House Estelmer''' ({{Pronounce|ESS|tel|mer|refs={{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|3}}

==Organization==
The Estelmer family arms comprised three daggers with black handles and silver blades, a green gauntlet; a brown shelf with black scrollwork, four white skulls, a gold half-shield, a white book, and a turquoise quill pen, on a white field.

==Activities==
Their trades and interests lay in heraldry, sage-lore, and printing.

Family members often prayed to [[Oghma]], the Lord of Knowledge.

==Base of Operations==
The family had a villa in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]], which took up almost an entire city block between [[Sulmor Street]] and [[Hassantyr's Street]] and between [[Vhezoar Street]] and [[Brondar's Way]].

==Possessions==
The family had resources up to 28,000 [[gp]] available.

==Relationships==
The Estelmer family supported the New Olamn bardic college and the Font of Knowledge temple to Oghma.

==History==
The Estelmers were ennobled in Waterdeep in the [[1293 DR|Year of the Talking Skull, 1293 DR]].

In the [[1366 DR|Year of the Staff, 1366 DR]], the Estelmers were among those families who backed the establishment of the [[New Olamn]] [[bard]]ic college. They continued to support it in the following years.

The Estelmer family also aided in the establishment of a temple to Oghma the city, by generously donating funds for the construction. The [[Font of Knowledge]], as it was called, was due to be completed by [[Midsummer]] of the [[1368 DR|Year of the Banner, 1368 DR]]. Until then, its planned Great Library was gathered and organized at the Estelmers' villa. Thanks to the Estelmers taking the lead, the Font of Knowledge opened on schedule with the greatest library in the city. They continued to provide financial support.

In the chaos that ensued in the [[Spellplague]], the family's fortune came to decline and eventually they lost their standing as a noble house.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Gilding a Noble|11}}
