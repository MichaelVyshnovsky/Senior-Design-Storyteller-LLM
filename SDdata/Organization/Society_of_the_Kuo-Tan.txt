The '''Society of the Kuo-Tan''' was a secret society secretly helping [[Shou Lung]].

==Description==
The Society of the Kuo-Tan was a vigilante organization. They investigated corruption, evil, and vice in the court or abroad and when they discovered any they took lethal countermeasures.

==History==
The Society of the Kuo-Tan split from the [[Tsui Tong]] when it started to become corrupt. The original founders of the Tsui created the Kuo-Tan to stop their now-evil first creation. In time, they gained the tacit support of the Emperors. In 1357 DR, one of their most powerful members was the maternal grandfather of the current Emperor [[Kai Tsao Shou Chin|Kai Chin]].
