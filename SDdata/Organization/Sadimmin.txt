El Sadimmin were the standard army of the country of Calimshan.
The term sadimmin was plural, and meant "powerful swords".
The Sadimmin forces of a given city were under the control of one of the sultans. In 1370 DR, el Sadimmin had the following military ranks, from lowest to highest
* Musar
* Chawal
* Yuzas
* Shyk
* Balak
* Qayadin
By 1374 DR, Calimshan had reinstated the archaic ranks of askar, djawal, and mumijin and created a new rank of sahrmak. An askar was originally a term for a generic soldier. Originally, "djawal" was a term for a noble soldier, or knight, who were similar to officer cadets. Historically, a djawal outranked a musar, but this had changed by 1374. Between the ranks of shyk and balak, the mumijin was now inserted, and a sahrmak was a higher ranking general than even a qayadin.
Upon reaching the rank of balak or qayadin, a soldier in el Sadimmin was granted a mansion or villa on the syl-pashas estate. This provided enhanced status for the officer but also meant that the syl-pasha could blackmail him more easily.
The barracks for the soldiers of each sabban was known as a sadidah. A sadidah often had a minaret attached to it and was four stories tall or taller. They tended to be simple and practical structures, holding 40 to 60 troops. Each garrison was controlled by at least four officers and contained armories as well. A sadidah armory was stocked about twice as well as that of a typical amlakkhan.
El Sadimmin awarded decorations to its troops who had demonstrated bravery or other favorable things, such as simply surviving a conflict. Known decorations in order of increasing prestige included
* Sword of the Syl-Pasha &mdash an embroidered badge awarded for being wounded
