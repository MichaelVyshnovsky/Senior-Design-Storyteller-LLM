The Loyalists were a faction of the holy slayer organization known as the Everlasting in 1367 DR.
The Loyalists were the only faction within the Everlasting to truly remain faithful to the Shadow Caliph, hence their name. If the Shadow Caliph were to die, the Loyalists would not hesitate to consolidate as much power as they could.
As of 1367 DR, 142 members of the Loyalists dwelt within the fortress of Sarahin.
Yusuf bin Ayyub was the leader of the Loyalists.
