        "mainbody": "'''Gillian's Hill Gang''' was a bandit group that briefly plagues the hamlet of [[Gillian's Hill]] and the adjacent patch of the [[Trade Way]] in [[1372 DR]].",
        "History": "Gillian's Hill Gang was a makeshift group of bandits assembled in the ruined tower of [[Gillian Cantilar]] on the summit of Gillian's Hill, turning it into a flophouse. They started robbing travelers and caravans that traveled along the Trade Way. Eventually, they adopted the name of Gillian's Hill Gang and became a big nuisance for [[Sejellus Krimp]], the owner of a distribution company that operated out of the hamlet. He posted a bounty on the gang in the city of [[Daggerford]] and eventually, the individual known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]] claimed the 500 [[gold]] [[coin]]s after disbanding and possibly killing the gang members."
