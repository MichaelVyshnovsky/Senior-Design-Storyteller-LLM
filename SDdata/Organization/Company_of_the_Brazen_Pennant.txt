The '''Company of the Brazen Pennant''' was a major ferrying service for towns and cities across [[northwest Faer√ªn]].

==Organization==
The company offered transport via ship to major towns with a port, such as [[Luskan]], across the [[Savage Frontier]] and [[Sword Coast North]], and even locations in the [[Trackless Sea]], such as [[Orlumbor]] and [[Mintarn]]. They were prompt with timing, and always left in the mid-morning within a one-hour time slot.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1358 DR]], they appeared to be the only company willing to take dangerous and risky trips, such as to [[Tuern]] and [[Gundarlun]]. However, such trips came at a cost of 100 [[gp]] per head, and disasters were known to happen. The [[Heroes of Ascore]] used their service to sail to Gundarlun and rescue [[Jagaerda]].
