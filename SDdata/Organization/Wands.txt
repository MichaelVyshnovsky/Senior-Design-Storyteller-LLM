In 1370 DR, the Wands family suffered a public embarrassment when Marcus Wands stole the family heirloom of Mulhorandi origins, the golden scarab beetle, that was said to bring magic luck to any Wands family member possessing it. The scarab was lost in Undermountain and Maskar Wands, the family wizard patriarch, requested Khelben Arunsuns aid in the matter. The heirloom was subsequently retrieved from the Tomb of Ankh-Kephra and returned to the Wands family.
