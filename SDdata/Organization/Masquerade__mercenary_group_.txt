The Masquerade were a mercenary company based in Waterdeep around 1358 DR. They were a company of professional spies and infiltrators.
The first sign of the Masquerade was around 1343 DR. They had infiltrated many governments and several other mercenary companies in preparation for potential future jobs.
The Masquerade employed many human thieves and wizards but all kinds of races and classes were welcomed.
They usually worked undercover to infiltrate the target. The Masquerade also used a large number of informants. The true Masquerade members had mental blocks implanted by a high-level psionicist. They usually only spied on or assassinated targets. The only kind mission in open battle that they accepted was to break sieges.
The Masquerade took 100 gold pieces for a day adjusted to the difficulty of the task.
Their leader was a doppelganger.
