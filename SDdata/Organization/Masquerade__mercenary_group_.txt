The '''Masquerade''' were a mercenary company based in [[Waterdeep]] around [[1358 DR]]. They were a company of professional spies and infiltrators.

==History==
The first sign of the Masquerade was around [[1343 DR]]. They had infiltrated many governments and several other mercenary companies in preparation for potential future jobs.

==Membership==
The Masquerade employed many [[human]] thieves and wizards but all kinds of races and classes were welcomed.

==Tactics==
They usually worked undercover to infiltrate the target. The Masquerade also used a large number of informants. The true Masquerade members had mental blocks implanted by a high-level [[psionicist]]. They usually only spied on or assassinated targets. The only kind mission in open battle that they accepted was to break sieges.

==Contracts==
The Masquerade took 100 [[gold piece]]s for a day adjusted to the difficulty of the task.

==Members==
Their leader was a [[doppelganger]].
