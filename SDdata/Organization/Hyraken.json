It was based in the town of [[Hilp]]. <ref group=\"note\">It is not altogether clear that \"Hyraken\" is actually a noble family of Cormyr. It is referred to only in the name of \"Lord Hyraken\" and in a single reference to \"the Hyraken\" in ''[[Into the Dragon's Lair]]'', page 20, upon which the supposition this is a noble house is based. Furthermore, Lord Hyraken is stated to hail from Hilp, but [[Doon Dzavar]] was previously established to be its local lord in other sources. It may be that the Hyrakens replaced the Dzavars, or are a much more minor family of Hilp, or that \"Hyraken\" is in fact a given name for a member of the Dzavars.",
