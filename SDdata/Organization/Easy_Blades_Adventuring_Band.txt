The '''Easy Blades Adventuring Band''' was an [[adventuring company]] that operated in [[Cormyr]] and [[Sembia]] in the mid-14th century [[DR]].

The Easy Blades were [[adventuring charter|chartered]] in [[Suzail]]. They were often suspect of conducting extensively smuggling operations along the coast of Sembia.

One member was [[Whelgar Taerncole]], though he'd retired before [[1358 DR]].
