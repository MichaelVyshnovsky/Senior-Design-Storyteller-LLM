The Church of Eilistraee was the primary religious organization of the followers of the goddess Eilistraee, the Dark Maiden.
The worshipers of Eilistraee were mostly drow either born into her society, or hoping to escape the Underdark and Lolths evil, taking back their place in the surface world and living at peace with all other races. However, in line with her ideals, Eilistraee would welcome and accept beings of all races who desired to see all people living in harmony, without pointless discrimination or wars, and worked towards that goal.
The main work of the church of Eilistraee was reaching drow trapped in Lolths web, aiding them, and providing them with a new life and future on the surface. The followers of the Dark Maiden also strove to offer kindness, help, and protection to those in need and they nurtured beauty and arts, spreading joy whenever and wherever possible and showing that the drow could create, rather than merely destroy.
On helping others
Eilistraeens were bidden to aid and protect all folks in need, of any race, whether weak or strong, kind or rude, and to promote harmony and acceptance among all races. They were to lend their help to all those who fought for good whenever there were ways to do so. Except when fighting evil, they were to be always kind, even to those who showed rudeness, and to aid others in acts of kindness.
They were to treat strangers as friends. Hungry travelers were to be fed and the homeless given shelter, under their own roof if needed. When traveling and while adventuring, they were to feed, help, and protect all those in need they met along the way as a prayer and offering to the goddess. They were also to patrol the lands around them, especially in cold winters, so that all those who were lost, hurt, or suffering the cold could be given appropriate treatment and shelter.
On promoting joy, arts, and beauty
Eilistraeens were advised to bring happiness and merriment everywhere they went, lifting peoples hearts with kindness, gaiety, songs, jests, and revelry. They were to nurture and create beauty, promote and practice music and dance, learn new songs and dances, and learn how to play, craft, and repair musical instruments. They were to pass this learning on whenever possible, and use it to bring joy to friends and strangers alike. It was said that feasts should always be joyful events and that food should be eaten with the accompaniment of music, save for sad occasions. The faithful were also told to practice swordwork, learning new techniques with the blade.
On drow
The faithful were meant to encourage drow to return to the surface world whenever and wherever there were ways to do so. They were to promote peace between them and other races, thus helping the drow forge their own place in the world and become part of its rightful, non-evil inhabitants. They were also to aid all drow who were in danger or in need of help. If they were in combat, the fighting had to be ended as soon as possible, with as little bloodshed as possible. All drow met, when not working evil on others, were to be given the message of Eilistraee.
On food
Food could be a source of joy the faithful were advised to learn how to best cook it and to gather new recipes and spices whenever they could. They were to feed themselves by their own gardening and hunting skills, and assist hunters when possible. If food was aplenty, part of it was set aside and given to all those in need (especially outcasts and individuals of other races) thus, Eilistraeens were advised to carry some food for this purpose. Any remaining food was given to priestesses of the Dark Maiden, as they would give it away in turn and none would go hungry.
On conflict
Eilistraeens were commanded to repay violence with swift violence, thus quickly removing dangers and threats, so that the fewest might be hurt. The bodies of evil enemies were to be burned as an offering to the goddess, unless they were edible and non-sentient and hungry people were near. When faithful, friends, and allies fell in battle, priestesses of the Dark Maiden were to comfort and sooth those who were mourning the loss, and provide a funeral song and burial.
On possessions
Wealth was to be used to buy food, swords, armor, and musical instruments and to assist the work of the goddess. When helping others, their price should be no more than a single tool or favor, or a good sword or armor, that could be used to serve the goddess will.
On slavery
Eilistraee and her church detested slavery and actively fought it whenever possible.

The Sword Coast was one of the regions where Eilistraee most often appeared to dance and speak with mortals, which impacted the activities of her followers in the region. For example, the citizens of Waterdeep witnessed her dancing in the moonlight near the walls of the city, up the road to Amphail. This led many moondancers to the City of Splendors, with the goal of creating a forest-shrine to their goddess (The Dancing Haven) within its walls. They persuaded Remallia Haventree, the Harper representative in the city, to offer her support to the endeavor. The events also caused some taverns to hold drow-themed shows, with performers painting their skins obsidian and wearing silvery wigs. While originally meant to be created in the Field Ward of Waterdeep, due to the chaotic developments of that area, the Dancing Haven was temporarily moved to the North Ward. The Eilistraeens planted and grew a small grove of trees within an abandoned, roofless building, and then used it as a temple and base of operations.
From there, the moondancers led a series of expeditions to cleanse, rebuild and resupply the Promenade. In the 1490s DR, a dozen priestesses, four novices, and nine lay guardians populated the temple Trelasarra Zuind was their (informal) leader.Few knew of the restored Promenade (aside from followers of Eilistraee), but rumors regarding it restoration spread in Skullport.
After becoming a Weaveghost, Qilué Veladorn no longer was the leader of the Church of Eilistraee--she chose to remove herself from mortal affairs for the most part, but she still talked and interacted with them through altars and sacred places, much like the other "dead" seven sisters could while waiting for Mystra to recreate their bodies. Eilistraee hadnt given up on her either, and granted the priestess full access to her divine realm.
During 1485/1486 DR, a group of Sword Dancers of Eilistraee, led by the charismatic and kind-hearted high priestess Saradreza Oussmtor, decided to help an unlikely coalition—agents of the Harpers, Zhentarim, Emerald Enclave, Lords Alliance, and Order of the Gauntlet the drow of Szith Morcane, led by archmage Solom Nedrazak the warriors following Elanil Elassidil of the Hillsfar rebellion the Red Plumes led by First Lord Vuhm Yestral the myconids of Sporedome and the illithids of Ryxyg—to oppose Grazzts growing influence in Maerimydra. The demon lord had in fact rallied the fire giants, led by his daughter Hledh Hellspawn, and turned Maerimydra into a base from where he could spread his demonic influence and gain control over the Prime Material plane (through a restored Undying Temple, which he planned to use to gain free access to the whole prime, surface included). His threat had already taken a heavy toll on the drow of Szith Morcane and in the area of Elventree and Hillsfar, leading unlikely allies to band together to face demons and giants. The followers of the Dark Dancer saw this as a good opportunity to lend their help and spread Eilistraees message among drow who were tired of Lolths tyranny or seeking freedom from the fire giants. The alliance eventually succeeded, and Saradreza and the other Sword Dancers gained a place in Maerimydra alongside the drow of Szith Morcane. They joined the rebuilding effort, hoping to reunite the drow of the Moonsea area and establish good relations with the other inhabitants of the region.
After the Second Sundering, the faith of Eilistraee had a following in the Aevendrow enclave of Callidae. Galathae, paladin of the Dark Maiden, led the defenses of the city, and handled the task of accepting outsiders.
Temples of the Dark Maiden were typically established in the mouths of caverns or in woodlands, places that allowed her followers to reach the surface world and act there. Temples in the Underdark—even shrines close to the surface—were unusual and the Promenade of the Dark Maiden was unique in being a large center of worship, and the main one, built underground in the caverns of Undermountain, it was built to prevent the return of one of Ghaunadaurs avatars to Toril. When not dictated by necessity, places of worship were chosen in a similar fashion to those dedicated to the Seldarine followers of Eilistraee used natural places that needed little modification where they could live in harmony with their surroundings, leaving few traces of their passage. Temples typically included a glade where they could dance and the moon was fully visible, a dark place removed from the light of day, a thick tree canopy, a freshwater stream, a forge to craft swords and armor, an access tunnel to the Underdark, and a vein of iron or some other metal suitable for the craft. However, all of that was not necessary, as a shrine of the Dark Maiden only required a moonlit glade and a song capable of leading one into a dance.
Eilistraeen communities usually formed around temples and shrines, and many were connected through a network of Moonspring portals.
*The Promenade of the Dark Maiden The main center of worship of Eilistraee after 1355 DR, located near Skullport. The Promenade was led by High Priestess Qilué Veladorn until 1379 DR. Starting since 1491 DR, its informal leader was Trelasarra Zuind.
*The Dancing Haven shrine in the North Ward of Waterdeep
*Imberlur, Eilistraee-worshipping drow city under the Border Kingdoms, known for its production of Spellbones, which made magic easily accessible to all
*The Chondalwood shrine
*The Dancing Dell, Ardeep Forest The Dancing Dell was a valley surrounding the Ladystone, a sacred stone touched by Eilistraee. The Dark Maiden herself manifested in the dell, more than once, to dance with her priestesses. Her worship in the dell was led by her chosen, Qiluè Veladorn.
* The Dancing Stone, Elventree A shrine to Eilistraee whose community was led by Seyll Auzkovyn. The followers of the goddess there were welcomed in nearby Elventree.
*The Dark Dancer, Ravens Bluff A shrine to the Dark Maiden whose community was led by Rebekkah Darklyte.
*Darkmaidens Leap, the High Forest A small clearing in the northern High Forest that became sacred to Eilistraee after 1358 DR. The magic of the goddess lingered in the area (especially on a large flat-topped stone bearing a single footprint the size of a drow females foot), blessing all those who danced there and keeping portals to her realm in Arvandor and to a cave near the Promenade.
*The Forest of Lethyr shrine The shrine was a natural pillar of black rock about ten feet tall, carved with crescent moon-shaped holes that created the sound of several flutes playing when the wind blew. The hilt of a sword protruded from the top of the rock. Hidden behind a nearby waterfall was a cave that housed the shrines followers.
*The Forest of Shadows shrine
* The Forest of Tethir shrine
*The Grey Forest shrine
* Lake Sember shrine
*The Lith Myathar shrine, set in an abandoned Lolthian temple within the city, was the base of the Eilistraean resistance against the Valsharess and shelter of many of the refugees created by her war.
*The Misty Forest shrine In a section of the forest littered with broken chunks of stone was an ancient structure that consisted of a dozen sharp sword-shaped columns of black obsidian set point-first into a circular platform of white stone the column-swords hilts flattened to support a weathered circular roof of white stone with a round moon-shaped hole at its center.
*The Mouth of Song, the Moonwood A shrine to Eilistraee located in a cave beneath a treeless hill in the Moonwood.
*The Shadowtop Glade, Velarswood A shrine located in a gully surrounded by shadowtop trees, in northern Velarswood..

*Qilué Veladorn, Chosen of Eilistraee (and of Mystra).
*Liriel Baenre. Although she ultimately became a cleric of Mystra, for a while she also followed Eilistraee, who guided and helped her in her journey. After unwillingly drawing the attention of Lolth on the Promenade and indirectly causing the death of Ysolde Veladorn and other drow of the Dark Maiden, she felt she could have no place among them, even though she kept feeling Eilistraees song and magic calling to her, as the goddess would have still accepted her. After that, Eilistraee continued to hold a particular significance to Liriel the goddess spoke to her emotional side, providing a sense of belonging and sisterhood, and reminding her of the beauty and joy that could be found in life.
