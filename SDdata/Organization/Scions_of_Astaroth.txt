The Scions of Astaroth, known also as the Astarothans, were a cadre of tieflings of demonic descent newly active in the mid–14 century DR. They named themselves for the long-dead demon lord Astaroth and were based in the former lands of Narfell.
They viewed Faerûn as another front in the great Blood War, and therefore tried to oppose the plots of devils to seize power in the Prime Material plane. Around 1370 DR, the Scions had just recently sensed the hand of Gargauth—the arch-devil-turned-god who slew Astaroth—behind the Knights of the Shield, and began to prepare for war against them. They predicted this to run for centuries, though the Knights were still almost unknown around the Inner Sea.
