The '''Scions of Astaroth''', known also as the '''Astarothans''', were a cadre of [[tiefling]]s of [[demon]]ic descent newly active in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They named themselves for the long-dead [[demon lord]] [[Astaroth]] and were based in the former lands of [[Narfell]].

They viewed [[Faerûn]] as another front in the great [[Blood War]], and therefore tried to oppose the plots of [[devil]]s to seize power in the [[Prime Material plane]]. Around [[1370 DR]], the Scions had just recently sensed the hand of [[Gargauth]]—the [[arch-devil]]-turned-[[god]] who slew Astaroth—behind the [[Knights of the Shield]], and began to prepare for war against them. They predicted this to run for centuries, though the Knights were still almost unknown around the [[Inner Sea]].
