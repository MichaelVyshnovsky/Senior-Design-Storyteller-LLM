The '''Hordes of Dragonspear''' were the collective forces of [[devil]]s, [[goblinoid]]s, and other monstrous creatures that launched a [[Second Dragonspear War|devastating offensive]] from [[Dragonspear Castle]], under the leadership of the [[pit fiend]] [[Baazka]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The fiendish army comprised three distinct divisions:

;The Marauders:
: Led by the [[cornugon]] [[Vrag]], the Marauders were looked down upon and tasked with undesirable tasks that often led to heavy casualties. In order to change this view and gain greater esteem, Vrag devoted his forces to increasingly dangerous missions. Vrag was served by two lieutenants, the [[kobold]] chieftain [[Wolg]] and the [[goblin]] leader [[Pruj]], each of whom commanded 500 members of their respective races.

;Blood Guard:
: The strong fighting force of the Blood Guard comprised [[monstrous humanoid]]s led by the devilishly intelligent cornugon commander [[Vooka]]. This group carried out the raids and main assaults of the Dragonspear army. Serving under Vooka was the ferocious commander [[Dahrgash]], and his 300 [[orc]] warriors, along with the authoritative [[hobgoblin]] chieftain [[Skarr]], and his 200 soldiers.

;The Storm:
: The Storm was the most menacing contingent of the fiendish horde. The brutal fighting force of 200 [[bugbear]]s and [[ogre]]s was led by warmonger [[Vesarius]].

==Activities==
The combined armies of Dragonspear led raids and outright assaults on settlements, forests, and other areas around the [[High Moor]].

==History==
The horde's first belligerent actions were inflicted upon the [[elves]] and [[druid]]s of the [[Misty Forest]]. The woods were devastated in a fly-by assault made by Maelestor Rex.

In the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, the [[barbazu]] serving Vrag and the Marauders were sent to scout the town of [[Daggerford]]. They managed to incapacitate [[Llewellyn Longhand|Sir Llewellyn Longhand]], the leader of [[Army of Daggerford|Daggerford's army]]. The raiders attacked the town's army again a short time later, in a battle outside of [[The Way Inn]].

The army was finally bested in the final battle of the Second Dragonspear War, that took place at their rallying fortress, Dragonspear Castle.
