The '''Neidlig''' were a tribe of [[goblin]]s in the [[Goblin Marches]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The tribe was led by the visionary and clever King [[Srubaash]], who claimed to be following the guidance of a mysterious spirit on his empire-building quest. In addition to hundreds of goblins, the tribe was home to a company of [[orc]] mercenaries and a large number of [[ogre]]s.

==Activities==
The Neidlig were the most powerful and expansive group in the [[Stonelands]], [[High Moors]], and Goblin Marches. They hunted and raided widely, and actively sought to build a new empire as the successor to [[Hlundadim]]. Despite their military power, they avoided warfare with others and focused on recruiting and integrating outsiders.

==Base of Operations==
The Neidlig made their home in [[Neidlig Citadel]], an ancient ruined keep in the southern Goblin Marches. Unlike most goblin tribes they did not hide it, but lived openly, as they were so secure in their power.

==Relationships==
The Neidlig used diplomacy whenever possible, and built alliances with their neighbors. They worked alongside the [[Merrowdrinkers]] hobgoblins and the [[Colchar]] orcs, but found themselves fierce rivals of the xenophobic [[Fenlis]].
