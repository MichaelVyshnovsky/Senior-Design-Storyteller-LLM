The Neidlig were a tribe of goblins in the Goblin Marches in the 14 century DR.
The tribe was led by the visionary and clever King Srubaash, who claimed to be following the guidance of a mysterious spirit on his empire-building quest. In addition to hundreds of goblins, the tribe was home to a company of orc mercenaries and a large number of ogres.
The Neidlig were the most powerful and expansive group in the Stonelands, High Moors, and Goblin Marches. They hunted and raided widely, and actively sought to build a new empire as the successor to Hlundadim. Despite their military power, they avoided warfare with others and focused on recruiting and integrating outsiders.
The Neidlig made their home in Neidlig Citadel, an ancient ruined keep in the southern Goblin Marches. Unlike most goblin tribes they did not hide it, but lived openly, as they were so secure in their power.
The Neidlig used diplomacy whenever possible, and built alliances with their neighbors. They worked alongside the Merrowdrinkers hobgoblins and the Colchar orcs, but found themselves fierce rivals of the xenophobic Fenlis.
