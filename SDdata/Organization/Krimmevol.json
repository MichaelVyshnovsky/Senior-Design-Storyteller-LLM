        "orgname": "the Krimmevol family",
        "mainbody": "'''Krimmevol''' was a wide-reaching family from [[Amn]] that achieved great political and mercantile power.",
        "Activities": "The family had most of its interests in the field of running caravans, The family also held a large amount of influence in [[Eshpurta]], with [[Jharvex Krimmevol]] sitting on the [[Shield Council]] for several decades. Their significant interests in Riatavin were controlled by [[Mundal Krimmevol]], who came to control a quarter of all caravan-related business in the city.",
        "Base of Operations": "The primary family estate was [[Crystalgates Manor]] in the city of [[Crimmor]],{{Cite dragon/334/Crimmor: City of Caravans|24,26,27}} with secondary ones in [[Athkatla]] and [[Riatavin]].",
        "Relationships": "The Krimmevols in Amn had good relationships with the [[Crytrapper]], [[Coprith]], and [[Zoar]] families, and lacked any real enemies among the domain's mercantile houses.",
        "History": {
            "Krimmevols of Ithmong": "[[Artek Krimmevol]]'s branch of the family was exiled from Amn and pursued by assassins, arriving in [[Ithmong]] in [[Tethyr]] just after the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]] in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}. They claimed a fortified stone building and made it into [[Krimmevol Hall]], but Artek and his son [[Dytor Krimmevol|Dyotor]] were killed by assassins within four years, leaving [[Jyordan Krimmevol I|Jyordan]] in charge of the family as a teen. Within a decade, the family was established as the leading blacksmiths and weaponsmiths of the city, with Jyordan building a close personal friendship and business relationship with [[Julian Gallowglass]], son of Lord-Mayor [[Ernest Gallowglass]].\n\nTheir fortune turned foul again with the [[Reclamation Wars]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, as Jyordan had by chance sold weapons to [[Yusef Jhannivvar]] just before he began his own bid for the throne. Jyordan gave assistance to Zaranda during her siege of Ithmong, betraying his long friendship with Julian Gallowglass, but then flipped once more when his trade partners in [[Myratma]] were threatened by Zaranda's forces. Jyordan, his three brothers, and their 14 sons took to the streets of Ithmong on the [[Night of Cold Claws]] and started killing all who called Zaranda their Queen. They killed scores of innocents before guardsmen contained them and the [[Purple Warlock]] suddenly appeared. The [[wizard]] turned nine Krimmevols to stone (creating the famous [[Krimmevol Court]]), slew four with fire, and cut the hands off the remaining five using a ''[[blade barrier]]''. The situation resolved, the Purple Warlock vanished and the Krimmevols were taken into custody.\n\nThe surviving men were transported to the [[Cloister of St. Ramedar]], where they attempted to escape repeatedly over several weeks. [[Errilam Krimmevol|Errilam]] managed to escape over the walls and fall to his death at the bottom of the cliff, but the remainder were sentenced to death as traitors, and subjected to hanging and drawing-and-quartering. Those Krimmevols who partook in quieter crimes against the realm were banished to [[Trademeet]] in [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, while the uninvolved members of the family were allowed to remain in Tethyr and practice their trades as before, with many becoming official Royal Blacksmiths and Krimmevol Hall becoming a royal guard armory. Though innocent, many of the women of the family chose to exile themselves back to Amn and take up quiet religious lives in penance for their sons' and husbands' crimes. Some went to serve the [[Church of Waukeen]] in [[Murann]] and [[Esmeltaran]], two went to [[Loviatar]], and three became [[priest]]s of [[Cyric]]."
