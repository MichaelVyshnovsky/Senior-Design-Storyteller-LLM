        "mainbody": "rimmevol was a wide-reaching family from Amn that achieved great political and mercantile power.\nThe family had most of its interests in the field of running caravans, The family also held a large amount of influence in Eshpurta, with Jharvex Krimmevol sitting on the Shield Council for several decades. Their significant interests in Riatavin were controlled by Mundal Krimmevol, who came to control a quarter of all caravan-related business in the city.\nThe primary family estate was Crystalgates Manor in the city of Crimmor, with secondary ones in Athkatla and Riatavin.\nThe Krimmevols in Amn had good relationships with the Crytrapper, Coprith, and Zoar families, and lacked any real enemies among the domains mercantile houses.\nThe Krimmevols were descended from the rulers of the duchy of Cortryn, a realm neighboring Amn that was absorbed in the 8 century DR.\nIn the , the Krimmevol family joined the Spulzeer and Coprith families in the founding of Riatavin. The leading figure of the operation was Riatan Krimmevol, who gave his name to the new settlement.\nBy the mid–14 century DR, the Krimmevols were one of the most powerful families in Amn, controlling vast swathes of business and trade in many of its cities and influencing the politics heavily.\nFollowing the secession of Riatavin in 1370 DR, the Krimmevols sought to normalize trade between the two realms and have a new duchy formed around it—either as part of Tethyr or as an independent realm, with Mundal Krimmevol as the duke. By supporting Pehllus Tanisloves plot to become King of Amn, they hoped to reform the duchy of Cortryn as an autonomous entity. Through this, the Krimmevols would ultimately control most overland trade between Amn and Tethyr, making them even more rich and powerful. They attempted to achieve this with their own influence, as well as with the Knights of the Shield through Lady Ninvara Krimmevols relationship with Lord Bly Ruldegost.\nArtek Krimmevols branch of the family was exiled from Amn and pursued by assassins, arriving in Ithmong in Tethyr just after the Ten Black Days of Eleint in the . They claimed a fortified stone building and made it into Krimmevol Hall, but Artek and his son Dyotor were killed by assassins within four years, leaving Jyordan in charge of the family as a teen. Within a decade, the family was established as the leading blacksmiths and weaponsmiths of the city, with Jyordan building a close personal friendship and business relationship with Julian Gallowglass, son of Lord-Mayor Ernest Gallowglass.\nTheir fortune turned foul again with the Reclamation Wars in the , as Jyordan had by chance sold weapons to Yusef Jhannivvar just before he began his own bid for the throne. Jyordan gave assistance to Zaranda during her siege of Ithmong, betraying his long friendship with Julian Gallowglass, but then flipped once more when his trade partners in Myratma were threatened by Zarandas forces. Jyordan, his three brothers, and their 14 sons took to the streets of Ithmong on the Night of Cold Claws and started killing all who called Zaranda their Queen. They killed scores of innocents before guardsmen contained them and the Purple Warlock suddenly appeared. The wizard turned nine Krimmevols to stone (creating the famous Krimmevol Court), slew four with fire, and cut the hands off the remaining five using a blade barrier. The situation resolved, the Purple Warlock vanished and the Krimmevols were taken into custody.\nThe surviving men were transported to the Cloister of St. Ramedar, where they attempted to escape repeatedly over several weeks. Errilam managed to escape over the walls and fall to his death at the bottom of the cliff, but the remainder were sentenced to death as traitors, and subjected to hanging and drawing-and-quartering. Those Krimmevols who partook in quieter crimes against the realm were banished to Trademeet in Marpenoth of the , while the uninvolved members of the family were allowed to remain in Tethyr and practice their trades as before, with many becoming official Royal Blacksmiths and Krimmevol Hall becoming a royal guard armory. Though innocent, many of the women of the family chose to exile themselves back to Amn and take up quiet religious lives in penance for their sons and husbands crimes. Some went to serve the Church of Waukeen in Murann and Esmeltaran, two went to Loviatar, and three became priests of Cyric.\nthumb|230px|Lady Syleda Krimmevol suffered a terrible fate.\nThe majority of the family lived in Amn, and managed the political and mercantile projects there.\n* Aernos Krimmevol, the patriarch of the family in 1370 DR.\n* Arilan Krimmevol, the Captain of Citadel Amnur.\n* Cahorl Krimmevol, younger brother of Jharvex who was framed for murder.\n* Jharvex Krimmevol, uncle of Aernos and member of the Shield Council of Eshpurta.\n* Mikaal Krimmevol, nephew of Aernos and best friend of Mayor Corlyn Braen of Crimmor.\n* Mundal Krimmevol, third brother of Aernos and overseer of interests in Riatavin.\n* Riatan Krimmevol, the founder of Riatavin.\n* Syleda Krimmevol, a lady who was killed and replaced by a mirrorkin.\nA branch of the family lived in Tethyr during the 1300s DR after being exiled from Amn.\n* Artek Krimmevol, a lunatic who was banished along with his family.\n* Dytor Krimmevol, son of Artek.\n* Ellem Krimmevol, nephew of Jyordan I.\n* Errilam Krimmevol, nephew of Jyordan I.\n* Jyordan Krimmevol I, son of Dytor who led a bloody treason against Zaranda Star in 1369 DR.\n* Jyordan Krimmevol II, son of Jyordan I.\n* Tuldek Krimmevol, younger brother of Jyordan I.\n* Ninvara Krimmevol, a lady who was banished from Tethyr after the treason."
