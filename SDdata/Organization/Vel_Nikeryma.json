        "mainbody": "he VelNikeryma (or Blade Lords) was the organization that acted as the guiding council for the Eldreth Veluuthra. Its purpose was to gather information from across Faer没n in order to dictate the direction of the Eldreth Veluuthra but, in general, they avoided intervention in individual cells matters.\nAlthough the organization was originally led by members of its five founding families, as of 1374 DR, this was no longer the case, and the leadership was determined by voting amongst its most powerful members.\nRecruitment into the VelNikeryma was through the Eldreth Veluuthra. An established member could apply to become an agent and be granted a sort of free-roaming status in Faer没n. An agent would be expected to gather information and pay a portion of his or her treasure to superiors, in exchange for knowledge of the organizations passcodes, handshakes and symbols. An agent would be able to seek supplies and shelter from a cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra, and only if the agents stay exceeded a tenday or demands were very high could the cells leader demand a task be carried out.\nAround 1374 DR, agents were sent on treasure hunts to the House of Stone, a ruin near the edge of the Ardeep Forest. They were also tasked with locating the ancient Myth Rhynn and restoring its mythal.\nOn Evermeet, the organization was responsible for gathering information and subverting sun elf families.\n* Bhyrindar \"Silverhart\" Tellynnan, the werewolf leader of the High Forest cell.\n* Eldaerneth Spellstalker, an infiltrator of the Night Masks in Westgate.\n* Saeval Calaudra, an agent who gave support to any cell in Faer没n that needed it and spread the word about the VelNikeryma.\n* Talindra Amalith, leader of the Methwood cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra.\n* Torynnar Rhaevaern, a baelnorn and, as of 1374 DR, the only surviving member of the founders of the Eldreth Veluuthra.\nAround 1374 DR, a female member of the organization was killed by the daemonfey in the High Forest, where it was keen to gain more information about the human settlement called Olostins Hold.\nCategoryElven organizations\nCategoryOrganizations in Faer没n\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\n9tw5phbe5qlb2gp3zp8drodrr5dh4gk"
