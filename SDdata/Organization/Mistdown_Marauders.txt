The '''Mistdown Marauders''' were a famed [[adventuring company]] that operated in [[the Vast]]. They were based out of [[The Stag and Viper]] [[inn]] at [[Viperstongue Ford]].

==History==
The Mistdown Marauders gained some fame for their exploits. They were believed to have earned a fortune in coin, [[gem]]s, [[jewellery]], and magical [[armor]].

When they attempted to loot treasure belonging to a [[ghost]], they met a grisly end. Their bodies were found stripped of their own wealth and treasure, apparently claimed by the ghost. They buried amongst trees north-east of Viperstongue Ford.

Afterwards, local legend held that, buried with the Marauders, were cryptic clues to the location of the ghost's treasure. It was also said that some of the Marauders had risen as undead to guard their graves.
