The '''Chainstone''' family was one of the most powerful aristocratic houses of [[Athkatla]], the capital of [[Amn]], by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Base of Operations==
House Chainstone was based in Athkatla's political heart, the [[Athkatla/Scepter District|Scepter District]]. Like other powerful Scepternian houses, Chainstones' sprawling family compound was the size of a city block.
