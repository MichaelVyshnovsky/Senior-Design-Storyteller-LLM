        "mainbody": "he Schooled was the name given to the students of the Magister Caldauvur Maerglauthyn. The Magister enforced ironclad discipline amongst his students through spells, but he accepted anyone into his classes even his greatest detractors understood he meant to create a body of mages with conscience, strong ethics and a common understanding of principles. At least one of the communities of the Schooled lived in a manor within the lower Dessarin Valley."
