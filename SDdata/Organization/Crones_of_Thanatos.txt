}}The '''Crones of Thanatos''', also known as simply the '''Crones''', was the primary religious organization dedicated to the worship of [[Kiaransalee]], the [[drow]] [[goddess]] of [[undeath]] and vengeance.

==Dress==
Crones always dressed in loose black hooded robes, wore a gray [[skullcap (cap)|skullcap]], and sported at least one [[silver]] ring on each hand.

As many of them eventually embraced [[undeath]], they became either [[revenant]]s or [[keening spirit]]s, raised by the goddess herself.<ref>

When undead, they were powerful enough to be unaffected by the [[turn undead|rebuke]] of a cleric and could [[paralyze]] at a distance. They could cast [[illusion]]s related to the past of the victim and damage living beings with just a touch. They healed from physical wounds in mere seconds.

==History==
When [[Cavatina Xarann]] and [[Kâras]] were in the Hunt, they came across a Crone revenant, who had previously had been Kâras's lover in [[Maerimydra]].

In the [[Underdark]], [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] and many other [[diviners]] of [[Sshamath]] realized that when casting [[divination]]s they emitted a flicker of [[faerie fire]], which was unprecedented.<ref> After contacting the [[Church of Eilistraee|priestesses of Eilistraee]] and confirming that only drow were affected, [[Seldszar Elpragh]], [[Urlryn Khalazza]] and [[Qilué Veladorn]] organized a joint expedition to uncover the mystery. The situation got worse, with divinations becoming increasingly difficult to perform, but evidence pointed to the [[Acropolis of Thanatos]], the largest temple of Kiaransalee, which was heavily guarded by Crones and other undead.<ref> The expedition discovered that the Crones were amassing a massive amount of [[voidstone]] within the Acropolis, hoping to create a [[gate]] and summon an army of undead from the [[Negative Energy Plane]].<ref> Incidentally, the voidstone reacted with the ''[[faerzress]]'', increasing its energy and disrupting drow [[magic]] in the region.
When [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] and his apprentices used [[Elven High Magic]] to erase Kiaransalee's name from the minds of her worshipers, all the undead Crones died on the spot, and the rest stumbled about, confused about the sudden lack of purpose and patron deity.

Although [[Cavatina Xarann| Cavatina]], noticing the Crones' defenseless and pitiful state asked [[Qilué Veladorn|Qilué]] about the possibility to redeem them and spare their life, [[Wendonai]]'s influence, acting through the possessed [[Crescent Blade]], made Qilué order their death.
