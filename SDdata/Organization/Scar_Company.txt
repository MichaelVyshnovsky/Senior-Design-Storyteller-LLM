'''Scar Company''' was an irregular military unit that protected the city of [[Neverwinter]] from the horrors of the [[Chasm]] in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
Scar Company was composed only of a handful of [[spellscar]]red individuals who were skilled combatants. Their headquarters were located in [[Scar Keep]], a ruined military outpost near the Chasm, and they maintained a forward-base within the Chasm at [[Fort Precipice]]. In spite of all the hardships they faced, or perhaps because of them, Scar Company soldiers were renowned for their courage and dedication to Neverwinter.

==Possessions==
Scar Company was perpetually ill-supplied as no Company soldier was allowed to leave the Chasm once they were sent there, and few people in Neverwinter were willing to brave a trip into the Chasm to give them supplies, for fear of the [[plaguechanged]] horrors or of contracting a spellscar (or something worse).

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, [[Dagult Neverember]], as part of the rebuilding efforts of Neverwinter, decreed that all citizens who were affected by the Spellplague were to be sent to [[Helm's Hold]] for treatment and confinement. This edict was known as the [[New Neverwinter#Protector's Law|Protector's Law]]. However, for those few who were also skilled combatants or had any training in fighting skills, Neverember devised an alternative plan: they could "volunteer" to serve as Neverwinter's sworn protectors, fighting the plaguechanged horrors of the Chasm. Those who accepted this assignment knew it was tantamount to a death sentence, but deemed it preferable to the asylum at Helm's Hold.
