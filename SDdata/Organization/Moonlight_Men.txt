The '''Moonlight Men''' were a mercenary company famous for saving the cities of [[Silverymoon]] and [[Everlund]].

==History==
The Moonlight Men were a mercenary company for only eight years, but during that brief time, they gained a great reputation. They usually guarded caravan roads around [[Sundabar]], Silverymoon, and Everlund.

Their last battle was the defense of [[Turnstone Pass]] against a huge [[orc]] [[Nethertide Horde|horde]]. They managed to crush the orcs, but only six Moonlight Men, include [[Mintiper Moonsilver]], survived. Mintiper went to wander south, while the others possibly joined the army of Silverymoon.

The bodies of the fallen mercenaries were interred in the [[Cairn of Moonlight]] within the Pass.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}}
