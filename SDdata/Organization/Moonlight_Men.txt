The Moonlight Men were a mercenary company famous for saving the cities of Silverymoon and Everlund.
The Moonlight Men were a mercenary company for only eight years, but during that brief time, they gained a great reputation. They usually guarded caravan roads around Sundabar, Silverymoon, and Everlund.
Their last battle was the defense of Turnstone Pass against a huge orc horde. They managed to crush the orcs, but only six Moonlight Men, include Mintiper Moonsilver, survived. Mintiper went to wander south, while the others possibly joined the army of Silverymoon.
The bodies of the fallen mercenaries were interred in the Cairn of Moonlight within the Pass.
* Mintiper Moonsilver.
* Lord Laerlos Silmerhelve II of Waterdeep.
* Tsaelynos of Everlund, a wizard-priest of Sel√ªne.
* Barundar "Firebeard" Battlehammer, a dwarf.
