The Purple Flame was an adventuring company operating out of a keep near Soubar.
This large group of warriors hired themselves out for some years as caravan guards and often fought the creatures of Darkhold, a nearby stronghold of the Zhentarim. In 1358 DR, they recruited many new members and decided to become a true mercenary company.
The leader Thintel Ormbar and Sindel, a sorceress, were lovers.
