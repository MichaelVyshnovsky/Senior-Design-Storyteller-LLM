A vision of Tyrs warhammer shows the gods favor and permits immediate acceptance into the order. A vision of Tyrs sword means that the aspiring Hammer has failed in some way and must atone before entering the ranks. A successful atonement quest allows the aspirant to join the Order as though he had seen the vision of the warhammer. Currently there are less than 12 Hammers in active service, a testament to the purity and power required to become one of the order.\nCategoryPaladin orders\nCategoryMilitary organizations\nCategoryTyrran organizations\nCategoryReligious organizations\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\nt4o92i2x7lyqgusias0v47q4p4z3ak8"
