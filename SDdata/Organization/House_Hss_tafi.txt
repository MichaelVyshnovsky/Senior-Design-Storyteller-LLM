House Hsstafi was a tribe of yuan-ti distinguishable by their cobra-like hoods. Members of this tribe were called Hsstafin.
House Hsstafi once resided on the northwest shores of the Lapal Sea in the Black Jungles. The entire tribe was magically transported from the jungles into the ruins of Ssthartissssun in the Forest of Wyrms in -320 DR.
House Hsstafi viewed themselves as the most practical of the hasrammass. They worked well under the nagas and other species, realizing that by doing so they could ultimately advance Sseths goals, and by default those of the yuan-ti, across Faer√ªn. This view led the other great yuan-ti tribes to view the Hsstafin with distrust.
The Hsstafin became part of the ruling class of Najara, the Kingdom of Snakes, ever since their arrival in -320 DR. They held various roles including those of merchants, administrators, and religious leaders.
House Hsstafi played a critical role in rebuilding the ruined sarrukh city of Ssthartissssun during the reign of Terpenzi. The Hsstafin were instrumental in reestablishing the rule of the nagara after Najaras fall which helped transform the kingdom into a major power in the Western Heartlands.
The Hsstafin were the first tribe of yuan-ti to develop the process for creating tainted ones and broodguards.
