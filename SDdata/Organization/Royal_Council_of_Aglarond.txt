The '''Royal Council of Aglarond''' was the council that advised [[the Simbul]], ruler of [[Aglarond]], since the beginning of her reign in [[1320 DR]].

==Activities==
It met monthly, usually at full moon, at the [[Council Hall]] in [[Velprintalar]]. As of [[1374 DR]], the council meetings had reached around a [[tenday]] in length.

==Membership==
The council was made up of 30 members, of which 11 were from major cities and the others were from smaller villages in Aglarond. [[The Fang]] and [[Dahst]] did not recognize their being part of Aglarond at all, and therefore did not send a councilor. Most of the positions on the council were hereditary positions held by the nobility of a particular province or city.

==History==
The council was originally formed when Aglarond was created in [[1065 DR]].
