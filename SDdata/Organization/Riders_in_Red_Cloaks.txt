The '''Riders in Red Cloaks''' were the mounted defenders of the market-town of [[Asbravn]], in the southern [[Sunset Vale]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Comprising local volunteer townfolk, along with a few seasoned warriors and [[wizard]]s, they were sponsored by [[Iriaebor]] to patrol the roads of the [[Dusk Road]] and [[Uldoon Trail]] and keep them safe.

Asbravn and the Red Cloaks were synonymous with one another, as almost every family in town counted at least one relative within their ranks.

==Activities==
The Red Cloaks often faced [[orc]]s, [[bugbear]]s, [[troll]]s, and other monstrous humanoids that roamed between the [[Reaching Woods]] and [[Sunset Mountains]].

They received 10 [[gp]] per week in pay,

==Equipment==
The Riders were armed with ''[[longsword]]s'' and ''[[spear]]s'' and wore ''[[chainmail]]'', or ''[[plate mail]]'' in the case of the officers. Of course they all wore red cloaks, from which their organization drew its name.

==History==
In [[Ches]] of [[1357 DR]], a horrifying creature "with many heads all like snakes" attacked a couple of farms north of Asbravn. The leader of the Riders in Red Cloaks reached out for aid in slaying this monster and even sent a carrier pigeon to [[Masked Lord|Lord]] [[Piergeiron the Paladinson|Piergeiron]] of [[Waterdeep]] for aid.

Around the year [[1366 DR]], a number of protectors of Asbravn were reportedly [[poison]]ed. To add to these heinous attacks, the group had been repeatedly ambushed by a number of well-paid mercenary companies. The [[Zhentarim]] were suspected to be responsible for these crimes.
