The Black Gauntlet was an adventuring company active during the 13 century DR.
The group was led by Jhastan and Quarra. They were based out of Starmantle on the Dragon Coast.
The Black Gauntlet confronted and slew the mighty green dragon Chathuulandroth in his lair. Upon sorting through the dragons hoard they discovered the tome Unique Mageries. The group disbanded following the deaths of their leaders.
