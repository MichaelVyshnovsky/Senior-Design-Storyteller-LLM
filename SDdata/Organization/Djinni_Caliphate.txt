The Djinni Caliphate was the collective term referring to the ruling body of government of the djinn.
The Great Caliph, Husam al-Balil ben Nafhat al-Yugayyim, ruled over all of the noble djinni comprising the Djinni Caliphate.
Husam kept 20 of his most trusted followers near him at all times.
The Great Caliph and his court rarely left their stronghold. When they did it was usually a trip to Zakhara to create trouble for the great cities of the Land of Fate.
The Citadel of Ice and Steel within the Elemental Plane of Air served as the seat of power for the Djinni Caliphate.
