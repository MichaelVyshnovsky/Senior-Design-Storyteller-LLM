The family was distantly related to the [[Truesilver]]s.\n\nThe family was very keen on expanding Cormyr's shipping interests and enlarging the official presence of Cormyr's navy in the [[Inner Sea]], and allied with the Truesilvers in this goal.  The relocation of Cormyr's navy to Suzail from [[Marsember]] in the late 15th century DR boosted the family's power.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail}}",
