'''House Arabani''' was a [[drow]] house of [[Sshamath]].

==Organization==
This house was not involved in politics and instead were the owners of the [[Jacinth Rose]] in the [[Dark Weavings Bazaar]]. Here, they sold [[gem]]s, [[jewelry]], and occasionally ''[[ioun stone]]s'' and ''[[gem of seeing|gems of seeing]]''. They were reluctant to sell their best wares to non-drow.

==History==
House Arabani were once a great and powerful drow house in [[Sshamath]], though this was no longer the case as of [[1370 DR]]. After their downfall, they were still referred to as nobles.
