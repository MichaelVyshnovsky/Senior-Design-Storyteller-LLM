'''Nyaril''' was one of several local merchant families in [[Arabel]] who held great political power in that city. They were primarily grain merchants.

==Activities==
The Nyarils sold and traded grains primarily within the city of Arabel and had little business elsewhere in Cormyr.

==Base of Operations==
Their large, walled manor was located in the north{{Arabel map orientation}} of the city of Arabel, in the richest part of the city among other tall mansions. The manor sat between the [[Falcon's Rest]] inn and the [[Watchful Shield (business)|Watchful Shield]] and was across the street from a large grove that contained a temple to [[Sune]].

The family owned and operated four large warehouses located at the southeastern corner of the city, near the wall and south of the [[Swinging Gate]] inn.

The southernmost warehouse had dimensions of {{SI|50|feet|long=yes}} by {{SI|200|feet|long=yes}}, with a {{SIAdj|20|feet|adj=high|long=yes}} arched roof. Its walls were made of thick wood, and its floor of stone. It had no ceiling, only rafters. There was a small basement. A set of large double doors entered the warehouse from opposite ends.{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|41-42}}

The southern end of this warehouse contained an inventory office, a large goods area, a break area, a manager's office, and several storage stalls.

==History==
Around [[1360 DR]],{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|28-29}} the 
[[Night Parade]], seeking revenge against [[Myrmeen Lhal]] for her victory over them the prior year in [[Calimport]], purchased the southernmost warehouse from the Nyaril family, which they then established as a base.{{Cite dungeon/61/Storm Season|36}} Within the warehouse, the elite squad of monsters were constructing a [[portal|''gate'']] to the [[Demiplane of Nightmares]], from which they intended to summon reinforcements. The ''gate'' required power from five lightning bolts per day over a period of ten days to be activated. Lord [[Tempos (Night Parade)|Tempos]], their leader, summoned thunderstorms each night to charge the ''gate''.

==Rumors & Legends==
There was a market for [[basilisk]] [[poison]] sacs in Arabel, and House Nyaril was rumored to possess maps that detailed the migration routes of basilisks in the [[Storm Horns]] and [[Thunder Peaks]] mountain ranges.
