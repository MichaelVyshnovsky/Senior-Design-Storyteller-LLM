The '''anchorites of Talos''' were a loosely organized group of [[half-orc]] [[shaman]]s and [[mystic]]s dedicated to [[Talos]]. They were active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] around the [[Sword Coast North]].

==Organization==
The anchorites of Talos were a reclusive group who rarely operated in large numbers. All members shared both [[human]] and [[orc]] ancestry, and were blessed by Talos with mastery over lightning, including allowing them to cast ''[[lightning bolt]]s'' at their enemies. In addition, the anchorites were all [[shapechanger]]s who could take the form of [[boar]]s. They revered one of Talos's servants, the [[primal spirit]] known as [[Gorthok|Gorthok the Thunder Boar]].

==Activities==
The anchorites served Talos's will by inflicting destruction on those they saw as intruding on their territory. They performed rituals in honor of Talos, often involving [[humanoid]] and [[animal]] sacrifices followed by dancing. These rituals were used to invoke Talosâ€™s favor, to create magical storms in his name, and to summon Gorthok the Thunder Boar to wreak havoc. The anchorites also nurtured and made use of other monsters to attack local populations, including [[ankheg]]s

==Tactics==
Anchorites tended to prefer to attack from a position of advantage. They used their [[magic]] to breed or compel monsters to fight for them,

==Base of Operations==
The anchorites did not have a centralized base of power, however they were known to make sacrifices to their god and to perform their [[ritual]]s at a sacred site in [[Neverwinter Wood]] known as the [[Circle of Thunder]].  

==Possessions==
As shape-shifting hermits, the anchorites had little use for most possessions. The wore clawed [[gauntlets]] for use in combat,

==Relationships==
Among the [[orcs]] of the [[Sword Mountains]], they were respected as mystics and advisors, and would provide blessings to the tribes in times of hardship.

They were generally opposed to "civilized" folk, making them a threat to the safety of nearby towns, such as [[Phandalin]] and [[Leilon]]. They were also known to attack logging operations within Neverwinter Wood.

When the [[Cult of Talos]] arose with plans to sow destruction up and down the [[Sword Coast]], many anchorites joined them.

==History==
The anchorites of Talos were active in the late 15{{th}} century DR, shortly after the [[Second Sundering]] in which their god Talos was once again recognized as a distinct [[deity]] from the [[Orc pantheon|orcish god]] [[Gruumsh]].{{Cite dragon/378/Domains in Eberron and the Forgotten Realms|36-37}}

The anchorites became notable threats during the period in which the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] claimed the area north of the Sword Mountains as his hunting ground. A tribe of orcs was driven from their stronghold at [[Icespire Hold]] by the dragon, and made their way to the anchorites in Neverwinter Wood for assistance. Bolstered by these orcs, the anchorites became more bold in their efforts to push logging and hunting operations out of their territory, and plotted to summon Gorthok the Thunder Boar to aid them. During this time, they launched attacks on [[Falcon's hunting lodge]] and [[Tibor Wester's loggers' camp]].

At the same time, or perhaps beginning even before the arrival of Cryovain, many anchorites joined forces with the [[Cult of Talos]], led by [[Fheralai Stormsworn]], who aimed to wreak havoc on trade in the region. The magic of the anchorites bewitched the lighthouse beacon atop the [[Tower of Storms]] on the coast of the [[Sea of Swords]], luring ships to crash on the cliffs so that the cult could plunder them. When this scheme captured a [[death knight-dreadnaught]], several anchorites ended up helping to crew the ship. During this time, many other cultists began referring to themselves as "anchorites" as well.

==Members==
* [[Drethna]], who summoned ankhegs to attack loggers in Neverwinter Wood.
* [[Flenz]], who performed rituals at the [[Circle of Thunder]].
* [[Grannoc]], who cultivated a [[Gulthias tree]] in order to spawn [[blight]]s.
* [[Moesko]], who was the keeper of the shrine and lighthouse at the [[Tower of Storms]].
* [[Narux]], who performed rituals at the Circle of Thunder.
* [[Yargath]], who was in charge of defending the Circle of Thunder.
