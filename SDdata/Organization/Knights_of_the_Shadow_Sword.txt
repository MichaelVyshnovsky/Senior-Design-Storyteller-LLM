The Knights of the Shadow Sword was a military order devoted to Shaundakul, the Rider of the Winds.
The order operated out of Shaundakuls Throne in Myth Drannor.
The Knights of the Shadow Sword were founded by a half-elf named Jax Nightsong. The order was composed of crusaders, rangers, and windwalkers. They dedicated themselves to ridding the forests around Myth Drannor, as well as the city itself, of evil creatures.
