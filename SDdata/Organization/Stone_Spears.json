        "mainbody": "he Stone Spears, or simply the Spears, were the standing army of the city of Tulmon along the coast of the Lake of Steam in south Faerûn.\nThe vast majority of soldiers, some 3,650 to be precise, were garrisoned at Spearpoint Tower along Tulmons harbor. Several hundred more soldiers were stationed at both the Lehrengate and Bloodarch Gate.\nMost of the Stone Spears were foot soldiers who wore chainmail and wielded a broadsword and crossbow. The Spears were led by the Olembarlar, who was Grymmon Borlethgar during the late 14 century DR.\nThe Spears spent most of their time policing Tulmon and monitoring Crypt City, though they were known to respond slowly to emergencies."
