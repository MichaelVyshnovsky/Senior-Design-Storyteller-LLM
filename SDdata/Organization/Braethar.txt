'''Braethar''' was a powerful [[Amn]]ian mercantile family during the 11{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The Braethars helped end the venerable [[Torlath]] dynasty with the help of their archrivals, the [[Villax]] family. King [[Niskam the Doomed]] took the throne in the {{YearlinkName|1094}}, following the assassination of his great-grandfather King [[Imnel Torlath IV|Imnel IV]], and he was quickly slain in turn by agents of the Braethars. King [[Rhor the Lackey]] was installed as the puppet of the Braethars, but he was killed in the {{YearlinkName|1095}}, by agents of the Villaxes as they installed King [[Dornak the Puppet King]]. King Dornak was then quickly slain, and the chaos only ended with the rise of King [[Erdhinn Wavegold I]].
