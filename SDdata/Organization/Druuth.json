        "mainbody": "'''Druuth''' were small groups of [[doppelganger]]s in the employ of [[mind flayer]]s. A druuth shared the name, or nickname, of the illithid in command.",
        "Organization": "A druuth comprised a single illithid leader and four to six doppelgangers. They could also be [[greater doppelganger]]s. It was almost unheard of for a druuth to remain together without an illithid to exert control—only Hlaavin of the Unseen had successfully done so, and Hlaavin was secretly a [[half-illithid]] created as part of an experiment by the mind flayers of Ch'Chitl to establish a more effective druuth.",
        "Activities": "They operated essentially as monstrous [[Adventuring company|adventuring companies]]. Some druuth were known to conduct covert raids, with the doppelgangers adopting [[human]] form to avoid notice when they could and the forms of beasts when in the wilderness. Others worked to infiltrate cities by replacing powerful persons, in order to gather information or as a prelude to conquest.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Druuth slayer.jpg|thumb|right|400px|''A [[half-orc]] [[ranger]] and [[dire rat]] companion confronting a mind flayer after slaying its druuth.'']]\nSpecialist 'druuth slayers' arose to thwart and destroy druuth wherever they found them. Such folk studied the lore of these creatures, learned how to recognize doppelgangers even in disguise, and trained to resist an illithid's mental powers and shake off the effects of its ''[[mind blast]]''.<ref> Training as a druuth slayer was a prerequisite for joining the [[Confluence]], an organization dedicated to eliminating [[shapechanger]] infiltration of [[Waterdeep]]. One [[wizard]] who battled a powerful druuth created the ''[[eye of the druuthbane]]'' to strengthen the mind and reveal doppelgangers,<ref> and naturally these were common in Waterdeep.<ref>",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1246}}, in a bazaar in [[Murghyr]] in [[Murghôm]], a merchant double-crossed another merchant in a deal, but this was in fact a doppelganger member of a druuth. This doppelganger killed the merchant and the mind flayer took his recently purchased treasure—the holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]] ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]''. The mind flayer tried to exchange the tome for a more useful [[magical item]], but, by sheer chance, the man it tried to trade with was [[Rhighaermon O'Antlers]], a veteran ranger and former bearer of the ''Companion''. Rhighaermon killed the mind flayer and stole back the ''Companion'', and carried it to the [[Temple of Mielikki (Maerlar)|temple of Mielikki]] in [[Maerlar]]. However, he was hunted all the way by the mind flayer's druuth. Mortally wounded and with the doppelgangers close behind, Rhighaermon collapsed on arrival, and an [[avatar]] of [[Mielikki]] appeared and caused vines to ensnare, choke, and tear apart the doppelganger druuth with no more than her finger.\n\nDruuth first appeared—or, perhaps, were first ''noticed''—early in the 14{{th}} century DR and steadily grew to become a serious threat, though what that threat was, none could say [[Elminster]] described them as \"the rising scourge of the Realms.\"''Polyhedron'' #127 page 6 says \"These groupings appeared early in this century.\" implying a first appearance of druuth in the early 1300s, but ''Prayers from the Faithful'' page 118 has one earlier, in the late 1200s DR. It seems likely that druuth first appeared some time earlier, but were not yet an established type of organization or were not previously noticed because of doppelganger disguises, perhaps with the one encountered by Rhighaermon in Murghyr was not yet recognized as a druuth.\n\n''Circa'' [[1340 DR]], the mind flayer [[Nalynaul|Nalynaul the Shriveled]] abandoned its community in [[Gauntlgrym]] to become an [[illithilich]] and left its druuth on their own. Though Nalynaul expected the druuth to still pass along information, the other mind flayers took their revenge on the doppelgangers instead. Only two survived, having wisely left early: [[Semmonemily]] and [[Gondyl Ilitheeum]].\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], druuth were being encountered more and more often in the [[south Faerûn|southern realms of Faerûn]], that is, south of the [[Shaar]] and in the [[Shining Lands]]. They remained quite rare in the rest of Faerûn, albeit with significant exceptions.\n\nAt least four druuth were based in the [[Jundarwood]] in the [[Border Kingdoms]]; they launched raids all over the land and came to dominate in [[High Mukshar]]. Known collectively as [[the Others]] to the Muksharrans, the names of two of the druuth were known: [[Sshreea]] and [[Oinuth]], likely illithid nicknames.{{Cite polyhedron/127/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: The Border Kingdoms|6-7}}<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/129/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: The Border Kingdoms|10}}<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/134/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|9}}<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/137/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: A Wayfarers Guide to the Forgotten Realms|8}}{{Cite web/The Border Kingdoms/High Mukshar }} These druuth maintained an uneasy peace with one another, though only after three of them destroyed at least three other rival druuth, with the survivors forming the fourth druuth. The druuth did ally to defeat strong opponents such as [[adventuring companies]].\n\nOne of the most notable druuth, however, was that serving [[Thalynsar]] the Ulithautarch of [[Ch'Chitl]]. It  worked to infiltrate Waterdeep, but as Thalynsar grew distracted by events in Ch'Chitl from [[1362 DR]], the druuth achieved a great deal of independence. Its leader, [[Hlaavin]], accepted non-doppelganger members and expanded the druuth into the [[Unseen]] criminal network."
