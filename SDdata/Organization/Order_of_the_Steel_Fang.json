        "mainbody": "The Order of the Steel Fang was an elite militant order within the church of Tempus was founded during the mid–14 century DR.\nContingents of the order―known as Swords of the God―were led by members of the Tempuran church who had previously fought in many battles.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, the order led by a council of these experienced warriors of Tempus.\nThe orders members were usually assigned to especially dangerous duties, such as bodyguard work or as protectors of holy relics.\nThe order was founded in the , by a group of adventuring Tempuran clerics known as the Steel Fang of the God.\nOver time, more and more Steel Fangs were conscripted into various non-religious conflicts throughout Chessenta and the Vilhon Reach. They earned great wealth for the church of Tempus but incited displeasure in both senior clergy and Tempus himself.\nThe conflicted nature of the order came to a head in the , when Steel Fangs were conscripted to opposing sides of a conflict somewhere in the Realms. As members of the order slew each other in battle, Tempus grew so angry he appeared on the battlefield himself. He told his loyal Fangs \"Go home to your altars, and leave these leaderless folk to fight their own battles\", before disappearing in a roar of thunder. Tempus followers obeyed his command and the conflict came to an end. This event came to be known as The Tempuswrath.\nThe following year, the Order of the Steel Fang was repurposed as an internal disciplinary force, rather than soldiers for hire.\n* Bors Andrurvelkh\n* Cadalanth Norvruu\n* Cassian \"Heartbreaker\" Agivar\n* Erendralon\n* Faraelra \"Manyfangs\" Varurshield\n* Farlon \"Firehammer\" Adalon\n* Galadaera Mrorsun\n* Havalorn \"Old Sword\" Jeztorren\n* Holkur Obrannath\n* Junster Tarvrabuld\n* Nathamurra \"Nineswords\" Kloevrylda\n* Neztralarra \"Mighty Mace\" Maesadrar\n* Prestrur Tharaldron"
