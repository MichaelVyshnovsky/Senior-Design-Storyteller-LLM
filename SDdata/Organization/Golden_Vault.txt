The Golden Vault was a secret organization dedicated to correcting moral wrongs and keeping dangerous magical artifacts away from ill-intentioned individuals. It specialized in cases that were ignored by official authorities.
In addition to performing delicate heists, operatives of the organization acted as spies, collecting information on future targets and looking for talented new recruits.
The Golden Vault was rumored to originate from a good-aligned Outer Plane, but had operatives in major cities all over the multiverse.
The Golden Vault provided their operatives with a magical music box. When opened using special golden keys, the music box would recite the goal of their next mission in a soothing voice. The golden key would then vanish once the box was closed.
According to rumors, the Golden Vault was associated with well-intentioned metallic dragons. The organization would also associate with adventuring parties once they proved that they could be trusted.
At the request of Clan Axebreaker, the Golden Vault sent agents to Revels End in order to retrieve a magical key that would allow them to retrieve stolen riches.
