As of the early 1360s DR, the head of the Razhadi was Sheikh Utaiba.\nThey preferred the oasis known as the Well of the Chasm, in the Scimitar Spires mountains. They were one of only a few tribes that knew of its exact location.\nIn the , malevolent agents of the Zhentarim embarked upon a campaign against the Bedine people in order to gain control of a stretch of the Anauroch desert. As the army marched across the sands, they set up camp just outside the Well of the Chasm and besieged the Razhadi people within their cavern oasis. The siege was broken by the warriors of the Bait Mahwa tribe, who joined the Razhadi to defeat the Zhents and their asabi mercenaries at the Battle of the Chasm shortly thereafter.\nUnder the leadership of Sheikh Utaiba, the Razhadi went on to join the unified tribes of the Bedine at the oasis of Elahzad fight in the decisive Battle of the Fissures, and ultimately defeat the Zhentilar at Orofin, halting the armys campaign against their people."
