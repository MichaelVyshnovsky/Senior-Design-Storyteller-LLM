        "Organization": "Like all of the Bedine tribes, the Raz'hadi were led by a single elder man holding the title of sheikh. As of the early 1360s [[DR]], the head of the Raz'hadi was Sheikh [[Utaiba]].",
        "Base of Operations": "They preferred the oasis known as the [[Well of the Chasm]], in the [[Scimitar Spires]] mountains. They were one of only a few tribes that knew of its exact location.",
        "History": "In the {{yearlinkName|1360}}, malevolent agents of the [[Zhentarim]] embarked upon a campaign against the [[Bedine]] people in order to gain control of a stretch of the [[Anauroch]] desert. As the army marched across the sands, they set up camp just outside the Well of the Chasm and besieged the Raz'hadi people within their cavern oasis. The siege was broken by the warriors of the [[Bait Mahwa]] tribe, who joined the Raz'hadi to defeat the Zhents and their [[asabi]] mercenaries at the [[Battle of the Chasm]] shortly thereafter.\n\nUnder the leadership of Sheikh Utaiba, the Raz'hadi went on to join the unified tribes of the Bedine at the oasis of [[Elah'zad]] fight in the decisive [[Battle of the Fissures]], and ultimately defeat the [[Zhentilar]] at [[Orofin]], halting the army's campaign against their people."
