The '''Order of Tye''' was a prestigious knightly unit dedicated to guarding and escorting the members of the [[Lords' Alliance]] during travels outside the walls of [[Waterdeep]]. They were easy to spot by the Order's colors of azure blue.

==Organization==
Based in the City of Splendors, the Order of Tye's reputation brought numerous aspiring applicants. The number of aspiring knights led to the Order's leaders to implement rigorous initiation tests. The applicants bore the title of Squire and only the best of them reached the end of the trials. The trials varied greatly with many of the youths losing their lives during exercises, to deadly traps, or when sent to stand against dangerous beasts. The final test was referred to as the Knight's Trial.

==History==
[[Peneshay|Lord Peneshay]] was the leader of the Order of Tye ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]. Under his leadership the order flourished and gained significant prestige that increased the number of prospective members. In 1372 [[DR]], Squire [[Blancheflor]], Squire [[Launfal]], and Squire [[Camelon]] were facing their Knight's Trial. The trio was sent to the area known as the [[Lonely Barrens]], in [[Delimbiyr Vale]], to the east of [[Daggerford]]. The youths were ordered to slay a vicious and dangerous foe: the [[Mighty Rat of Cunning Demeanor]]. But the squires fled from the creature's lair at the sight of a swarm of hungry [[rat]]s that attempted to consume them. With the help of the individual known as the [[Hero of Daggerford]], the squires survived the ordeal and brought MRCD with them to the Order of Tye as a prisoner and the proof of their dubious valor.
