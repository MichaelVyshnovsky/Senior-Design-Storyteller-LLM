Clan Jalt was one of the dragonborn clans of the nation of Tymanther.
Clan Jalt was the clan tasked with the administration and defense of the frontier village of Ruinspoke. As such, Clan Jalt had a strong presence in the village, and was in charge of protecting the frontier between Tymanther and Mulhorand.
Clan Jalt was one of the few Tymantheran clans who allowed among its members followers of the gods, and some of their number were also members of the Platinum Cadre.
Clan Jalt was a traditional ally of Clan Belnak. They were also allies of the minor Clan Ibeig, and in fact, members of Clan Jalt encouraged the young couple to found their own clan.
