'''Clan Daraz''' was a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] clan that inhabited [[Faer√ªn]] sometime ''circa'' [[872 DR]].

==History==
Clan Daraz was most famed for the creation of [[enchanted]] ''[[Daraz hammer]]s'' that were created in huge quantities and ensorcelled for the clan to stand against an incoming horde of [[goblinoid]]s. Sometime ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|872}}, Clan Daraz took its last stand against a horde, but despite being armed with the magic hammers and stoic determination, the clan was extinguished by the sheer number of enemies. Since then, Clan Daraz's name was remembered thanks to the numerous enchanted hammers that found their way across the realms of the known world.
