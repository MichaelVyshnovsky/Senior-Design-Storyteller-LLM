Clan Daraz was a dwarven clan that inhabited Faer√ªn sometime circa 872 DR.
Clan Daraz was most famed for the creation of enchanted Daraz hammers that were created in huge quantities and ensorcelled for the clan to stand against an incoming horde of goblinoids. Sometime circa the , Clan Daraz took its last stand against a horde, but despite being armed with the magic hammers and stoic determination, the clan was extinguished by the sheer number of enemies.
