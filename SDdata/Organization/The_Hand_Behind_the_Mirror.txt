'''The Hand Behind the Mirror''' was a [[mercenary company]] based in [[Athkatla]] in [[Amn]].

The Hand Behind the Mirror was composed of [[shadowcasters]]. They used their [[shadow magic]] to swiftly transport warriors to other destinations via the [[Plane of Shadow]].

They were particularly useful in Amn's war with the [[Sothillisian Empire]] ([[1371 DR|1371]]–[[1374 DR]]) and the [[stinger]]s of [[Oaxaptupa]] (1374–[[1376 DR]]).{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Shadowcasters|}}
