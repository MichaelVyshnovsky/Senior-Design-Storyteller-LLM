The Silver Herd was a group of twelve unicorn stallions that often accompanied the appearance of an avatar of Lurue.
Lurue would always be at the head of the Silver Herd, leading them on spirited runs. The unicorns would stampede against any enemies threatening a follower of the Unicorn Queen in their presence.
The Silver Herd appeared before a group of adventurers, who would later become the Knights of the Unicorn, outside the elven castle of Ellahana Raikeil.
