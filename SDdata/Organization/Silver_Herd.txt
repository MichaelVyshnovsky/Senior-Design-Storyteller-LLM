The '''Silver Herd''' was a group of twelve [[unicorn]] stallions that often accompanied the appearance of an [[avatar]] of [[Lurue]].

==History==
Lurue would always be at the head of the Silver Herd, leading them on spirited runs. The unicorns would stampede against any enemies threatening a follower of the Unicorn Queen in their presence.

The Silver Herd appeared before a group of [[adventurer]]s, who would later become the [[Knights of the Unicorn]], outside the [[elven]] castle of [[El'lahana Raikeil]].
