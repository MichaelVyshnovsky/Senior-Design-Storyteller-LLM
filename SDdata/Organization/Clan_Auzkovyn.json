        "History": "The clan was named after the founder of the clan.\n\nThe clan wandered in [[Upperdark|Upper Underdark]] for centuries. At some point during the 12th century DR, they had settled in [[High Forest]] with the intent on founding a permanent state. But due to increasing hostilities from the [[wood elf|wood elves]], who intended found a state too, they decided to leave the High Forest.\n\nIn [[1371 DR]], members of Clan Auzkovyn created a portal which opened near the [[Abbey of the Sword]]. They moved to the forest of Cormanthor, to populate the lands the elves abandoned in their [[Retreat]].\n\nOnce on the surface, they decided to lead a nomadic lifestyle in [[Cormanthor]] instead of forming permanent settlements. They had good relationships with [[House Jaelre]], the biggest drow group in Cormanthor, both on organization level as they didn't kill each others' trespassers{{Cite web/Obsul Ssussun, \"The Door to Light\"}} Their relationship with House Jaerle improved later to a full alliance called the [[Masked Brigades]].\n \nClan Auzkovyn were mainly [[Vhaeraun]]ites but also followed other deities. They welcomed non-drow into their group, including [[elf|elves]], [[half-elf|half-elves]], and the occasional [[human]]. They also were known to provide tokens which gave the owner free passage for life time for services done for them, for example turning items of spiritual value for them as the [[Obsul Ssussun]], \"The Door to Light“, to them.",
        "Notable members of Clan Auzkovyn": "* [[Seyll Auzkovyn]], priestess of [[Eilistraee]].\n* [[The Widower]], a wizard who led a group of the Clan and the first holder of the Obsul Ssussun \"The Door to Light“. \n* Divolg Luen, a ranger and successor of the Widower as his group’s leader.\n* [[Zulifein T'orgh|Zulifein T’orgh]], the inheritor of the Obsul Ssussun."
