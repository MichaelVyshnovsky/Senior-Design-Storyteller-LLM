The '''Krakk't''' was a tribe of [[thri-kreen]] who dwelled in the [[Rushing Hills]] on the [[Shining Plains]]. Their territory extended into the plains themselves and southwest to outside the city of [[Surkh]].

==Organization==
The tribe only numbered about fifty or so members and was nomadic within their territory. The tribe was further split into three distinct packs, for which reason outsiders called them "tri-kreen".

==Activities==
They hunted [[rabbit]]s, [[Plainsteed]]s, and other herd animals that entered their territory.

They rarely attacked travelers in the area, but the chances of an attack rose if there were [[elves]] in the group,

The [[fire drake]]s of the [[Deepwing Mountains]] hunted for food in the Rushing Hills, and occasionally attacked the thri-kreen there.

==History==
After the founding of [[Assam]] in [[715 DR]], the three cities of the Shining Plains—Assam, [[Lheshayl]], and [[Ormath]]—spent the next three centuries in skirmishes and minor battles with the thri-kreen and [[centaur]]s of the plains, before they learned to live in peace.

Around [[1360 DR]], the folk of Lheshayl decided to try to drive the thri-kreen from the hills. They made sure no animals ever wandered into the tribes' hunting area. However, this tactic only drove the thri-kreen farther north and they attacked travelers on the road. This incident established the semi-official policy of driving some animals into the hills to keep the thri-kreen fed, so they did not prey on merchants journeying to Lheshayl.

==Relations==
Each year in the month of [[Tarsakh]], the thri-kreen sent one of their number to the [[Hill of Memories]] to meet with representatives of the [[human]] cities of Assam, Lheshayl, and Ormath; the [[Emerald Enclave]]; and the centaur and [[wemic]] tribes of the Shining Plains. Here they discussed any issues that had developed over the last year. At the meeting in [[1370 DR]], there were reportedly tense moments between the Krakk't representative, [[Kissikit'a]], and the ruler of Lheshayl, [[Entawanata]], but they and the other rulers mostly discussed trade routes, local monsters, and so on.

The [[Ten-Paw]] tribe of wemics freely shared the plains with the thri-kreen and other races. The city-dwellers had also learned not to fight the thri-kreen and other races.

==Rumors==
[[Liches]] and other [[undead]] were said to live in the hills, and some in Lheshayl said the undead controlled the thri-kreen, but these tales were unconfirmed.
