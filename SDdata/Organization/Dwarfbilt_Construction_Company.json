        "mainbody": "The '''Dwarfbilt Construction Company''' was an [[engineering]] business based in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Organization": "As their name implied, Dwarfbilt was owned and operated almost entirely by [[dwarves]].",
        "Activities": "This company could be hired out to help in constructing most structures.",
        "History": "Some years prior to the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, Dwarbilt Construction was approached by a [[merman]] named [[Slaythis J'harja]]. He desired to create an underwater restaurant in the [[Dragon Reach]], having heard from a number of land dwellers during his adventuring days of the many restaurants and taverns that dotted the surface. The company's workers were fascinated by the prospect and contributed much to its plans, with discussions bringing up a number of engineering and technical issues. However, Dwarfbilt was ultimately unwilling to do work in or on the water.''Port of Ravens Bluff'' (pp. 42, 45) states that Charles O'Kane became Mayor 20 years ago, which would set it in 1361 DR.\n\nSlaythis tried to make increasingly larger offers of [[gold]] and treasure for them to take his contract, but Dwarfbilt refused to budge. Eventually Slaythis yielded, thanking the company for their time and ideas. As they parted ways one of the employees took Slaythis aside and told him in hushed whispers of a fabled offshoot of the dwarven race, [[aquatic dwarves]], but warned that they might be unwilling to work with him. This lead would eventually culminate in the desired restaurant, [[Sharkey's Bar & Grill]]."
