        "mainbody": "The '''Durang''' were a tribe of raiding [[ogre]]s somewhere in Faerûn in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{cite book/Lady of Poison|37-40|4}}",
        "Activities": "The Durang were a raiding tribe.",
        "Possessions": "The leader of the Durang wore a shirt made of flattened [[human]] skins, the faces of which were animated and capable of biting. He also bore a [[greatclub|two-handed club]], {{SI|20|feet|long=yes}} in length, reinforced with both [[iron]] [[nail]]s and the teeth of many beasts.{{cite book/Lady of Poison|113-116|12}}",
        "History": "When [[Marrec]] joined the town militia at the age of sixteen, he fought the Durang in a raid on the village proper. Though they slew his adoptive brother [[Emmon]], Marrec discovered his petrifying [[medusa]] gaze while fighting; they retreated after seeing it in action. They made a second raid some time after; though Marrec had been banished from the village, he came to its aid together with his mentor, [[Thanial Selwander]]. The Durang leader personally led the raid this time around; the young man was forced to resort to his medusa gaze when his master was caught by the ogre chief. Though the ogre was petrified and his tribesmen retreated, Thanial Selwander was affected by the gaze too; after both of them fell over, their stone forms were shattered beyond recovery.",
        "Notable Members": "The Durang leader was an ogre about twice the size of his comrades, who could speak [[Common]]. He spoke with a foul, phlegmy tongue."
