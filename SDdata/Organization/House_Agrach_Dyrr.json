        "mainbody": "ouse Agrach Dyrr was a drow house of Menzoberranzan.\nHouse Agrach Dyrr was the fifth house in 1372 DR.\nThe house was located on Quellarzorl and built around nine stalagmites. It was surrounded by adamantine and stone. It had flying buttresses around its spires and a railless bridge across a moat-like chasm. The house had multiple reception halls, as well as a small sitting room with coral, limestone, and kuo-toa motifs. The compound itself formed of concentric circles, with a domed temple to Lolth in the center of the complex.\nHouse Agrach Dyrrs temple had a sacrificial altar limned in purple faerie fire and candles. There was a large black sculpture of a spider (a guardian golem), which was home to the Lichdrows phylactery. There were high-backed stone benches in the chapel, with weblike curtains, spider motifs, and actual spiders and webs.\nThe house had strong magical wards, many of which were placed by the Lichdrow Dyrr, including the master ward, which activated all wards in the compound in the event the lichs phylactery was destroyed.\nUntil 1372 DR, members of House Agrach Dyrr were the main soldiers at the Rhazzts Dilemma outpost some 30 miles south of Menzoberranzan.\nHouse Agrach Dyrr was more than 5,000 years old. Only House Baenre was older.\nMatron Mother Auropol Dyrr was killed during the drow attack on Mithral Hall in 1358 DR. After Auropols death, Yasraena Dyrr became matron mother.\nIn 1372 DR, House Agrach Dyrr entered into a secret alliance with the Jaezred Chaulssin, which had chosen that house because of the de facto male ruler, the (Lichdrow Dyrr). In exchange for the assassination of Matron Mother Ghenni Tlabbar, they worked with Nimor Imphraezl to betray Menzoberranzans Army of the Black Spider to the armies of Gracklstugh and Kaanyr Vhok. Nimor posed as Captain \"Zhayemd\" of House Agrach Dyrr in order to complete the deception. \nAfter the houses betrayal was revealed, the house compound was besieged by House Xorlarrin and its allies. Gromph Baenre battled Lord Dyrr, destroying his corporeal form and infiltrating the house to destroy the lichs phylactery. Destroying the phylactery activated the master ward, destroying the house temple.  Before the Xorlarrins could move in, Triel Baenre arrived and halted the assault. She met with Anival Dyrr, daughter of Yasraena, and made an agreement House Agrach Dyrr were to become vassals of House Baenre for centuries, \"essentially an extension of House Baenre.\" House Agrach Dyrr was also removed from the Ruling Council.\nAgrach Dyrr had orc and bugbear slaves.
