The '''Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors''' was the [[guild]] of [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s for the city of [[Waterdeep]]. However, while technically a guild, the Watchful Order functioned primarily as a mage academy. The Watchful Order also policed the use of [[magic]] within Waterdeep, encouraging wizards to use magic wisely.

The Order provided many services to its members, including a venue for trading [[spell]] components and [[magical item]]s. The Order served Waterdeep by providing spell wards for wealthy inhabitants and fire fighting through the use of [[water elemental]]s.

The Order also provided many services to the city. Members could earn extra money serving as a fire guard, firefighter, or spell guard. A fire guard was hired to stand watch over a building and squelch any fires that may start as well as alert the firefighters. A firefighter is just that - they are summoned to put out fires with [[magic]]. A spell guard serves as a bodyguard to counter magical attacks. Pay was typically 5, 10, and 10 [[Gold|gold pieces]] per night/day, respectively.
