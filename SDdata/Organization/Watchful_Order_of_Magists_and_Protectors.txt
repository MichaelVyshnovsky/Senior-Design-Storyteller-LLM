The Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors was the guild of wizards and sorcerers for the city of Waterdeep. However, while technically a guild, the Watchful Order functioned primarily as a mage academy. The Watchful Order also policed the use of magic within Waterdeep, encouraging wizards to use magic wisely.
The Order provided many services to its members, including a venue for trading spell components and magical items. The Order served Waterdeep by providing spell wards for wealthy inhabitants and fire fighting through the use of water elementals.
The Order also provided many services to the city. Members could earn extra money serving as a fire guard, firefighter, or spell guard. A fire guard was hired to stand watch over a building and squelch any fires that may start as well as alert the firefighters. A firefighter is just that - they are summoned to put out fires with magic. A spell guard serves as a bodyguard to counter magical attacks. Pay was typically 5, 10, and 10 gold pieces per night/day, respectively.
