        "mainbody": "'''House Despana''' was a [[drow]] noble house which was spread across many drow cities. One was located in the [[Vhaeraun]]-dominated [[Rilauven]] in the north, another was based in the devoutly [[Lolth]]-worshiping [[Ust Natha]] further to the south. A third section of the family was a minor house of [[Menzoberranzan]].",

            "Ust Natha branch": "This branch was headed by Matron Mother [[Ardulace Despana|Ardulace]], a powerful drow cleric. The Ust Natha branch employed the typical drow philosophy of female dominance and worship of [[Lolth]]. This branch was known for forming an alliance with [[Irenicus]], who planned on attacking [[Suldanessellar]]."

        "History": "Some members of the House turned against the typical matriarchal society of dark elves, and assumed power in a coup. After this, many of them went on to worship [[Vhaeraun]] instead of [[Lolth]].",
