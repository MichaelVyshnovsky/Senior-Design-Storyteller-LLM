While the church was viewed by many as mere scatterings of thieves and charlatans, the Maskarran faith was of the wealthiest churches in all [[Faerûn]]. They managed to achieve this feat despite operating primarily beyond the reach of lawfulness and in the shadows of civilized society.\n\n{{Quote|Trust in the shadows, for the bright way makes of you an easy target.|Excerpt of the Maskarran dogma.}}",

            "Politics": "While Mask held domain over the [[portfolio]] of intrigue, Maskarran priests regularly participated in local politics. They wove intricate tapestries of lies, deceit, and misappropriation to cast a shroud over the other crimes their fellow faithful committed. Mask's followers were not above thrusting a whole realm into outright war if it would foster an environment of advantageous lawlessness."

        "Rituals": {
            "Prayer": "Maskarran clerics offered prayer at night, when under the cloak of darkness, or during times of need. A courtier appearing before a noble court or even a member of a political envoy would beseech Mask's favor to ensure favorable discussions.\n\nDuring the daily 'Sunset Prayers', Maskarran clergy offered coins to their immediate superiors within the church's hierarchy, beginning with the Unproven. Once the Lord or Lady Master received their tribute, they presented it before the lowest-ranking clergy member as a token of appreciation for Mask's sardonic sense of humor."

            "Regions": "The Maskarran faith was prominent among criminals in many nations across Faerûn, including [[Telflamm]] in nation of [[Thesk]] Nearly every citizen of the city contributed in some way to the prosperity of the city's [[Shadowmasters of Telflamm|Shadowmasters]]. While many [[tiefling]]s across the Realms turned to the worship of Mask in lieu of [[Asmodeus]], the only recorded lineage of Maskarran tieflings originated from Thesk. many  \n\nThe faith was also quite popular in the [[Unapproachable East|eastern realm]] of [[Thay]], as well as cities in nearby [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]]. It was notable that Mask was the only non-native deity to garner any following of note in Mulhorand.\n\nWorship of Mask was prohibited in the otherwise tolerant realm nations of the [[Shining Lands]].",
            "Temples": "While shrines to Mask could be found in many cities across the Realms, true temples only typically arose in cities that maintained fewer laws against thievery and burglary. Quite often these temples were constructed in hidden locales, with underground tunnels that granted easy access between them and their local thieves' guildhouse.\n\nUndistinguished temples of Mask could be found within [[Tilverton]] in [[Cormyr]], [[Bezantur]] in Thay, and [[Westgate]] on the [[Dragon Coast]]. One long-forgotten shrine dedicated to Mask could be found deep within the [[Ithkyxan's lair|lair]] of the [[spirit naga]] [[Ithkyxan]], while at least one other was situated in the [[Street of White Roses]] in Bezantur.\n\nNotable Maskarran temples included:\n* [[House of the Master's Shadows]], in [[Telflamm]]; the largest temple of Mask in all of Faerûn.\n* [[Telamuzhidah]], a major focal point for criminal activity in [[Calimport]]."

            "Dress": "{{Quote|The degree of law in a town can be seen on the face of a priest of Mask.|A common saying regarding Mask's servants.}}\n\nAs would be expected, clergy of Mask's church often wore no specific vestments or insignias that could be used to identify their allegiance while operating beyond their temple. This was especially true among the faithful that took on the adventuring lifestyle. These adventuring Maskarrans―along with many demarches/esses preferring simple [[leather armor]] or unassuming clothes befitting common folk of the lands they traveled.\n\nDuring ceremonies and other rituals, Maskarran clergy wore flamboyant, vibrantly-colored tunics with puffed-out sleeves and striking embellishment. This striking attire was then covered in drab, hooded gray cloak, with the priest's face hidden behind a mask of black gauze. In lands where their faith was impinged upon, Mask's priests wore their gray robes in public as mark of his favor, along with a black [[wool]] mask, tailor-made to hide their features.",
            "Magic Items": "Senior members of the church often sponsored acquisition of certain [[item enchantment|enchanted items]] that aided the priesthood with their daily activities. Notable among these were ''[[ring of invisibility|rings of invisibility]]'', ''[[ring of shadow|rings of shadow]]'', ''[[rope of entanglement|ropes of entanglement]]'', and ''[[slippers of spider climbing]]''.\n\nThe ''[[Mask of Mysteries]]'' was a minorly [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[silk]] mask that resembled those worn by Maskarran priests, but functioned as a type of [[arcane]] [[spellbook]]. Anyone wearing the mask that performed the correct actions to activate it, gained access to a select number of spells. It also smelled faintly of some unidentifiable [[spice]]s."

            "Beliefs": "Mask's followers believed that any events that occurred \"within shadow\" fell under his domain.\n\nMaskarran clergy held a dynamic view of property rights and ownership of belongings. A individual or organization only held right of possession\nover assets so long as they remained in their physical possession.",

The ability to gain an edge over other with poised articulation―often utilizing feigned platitude―was considered a mark of distinction among clergy members. Integrity however was always maintained when working alongside other members of the church. Exemplary priests of Masks dutifully fulfilled the objectives proposed to their superiors within the church, even if numerous attempts were required for success."

        "Orders": "While the church of Mask sponsored no knightly orders, a number of its more daring and calculating members joined the [[Circle of the Gray Ribbon]].\n\nThe [[Night Masks]] of [[Westgate]] were one of the numerous thieves' guilds of Faerûn that considered Mask as their patron deity. Yet others like the [[Shadow Thieves]] of [[Amn]], merely venerated the Lord of Shadows in name only.",
        "Classes": "Priesthoods of Mask predominantly comprised [[thieves]], [[cleric]]s, and [[specialty priest]]s known as [[demarche]]s or demarchesses.\n\nA priest of Mask that chose to work specifically in large, densely-populated cities could take on the role of a [[catfoot]], whereas one that preferred to be out in the wilderness could join the ranks of the [[nightrunner]]s.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the [[Time of Troubles]] broke out across the Realms and the gods were sent down to [[Toril]] in mortal form. During that year, Mask took the form of a [[magic]]al sword called ''[[Godsbane]]'', which eventually fell into the possession of the mortal adventurer [[Cyric]]. At the culmination of those transformative events, Cyric ascended to godhood and took with him Mask's dominion over intrigue. That shift in divine [[portfolio]]s prompted Mask to redirect his followers' efforts across the Realms. They would no longer involved themselves in political schemes or public plots and focus their deception to a more personal and individual scope.",
