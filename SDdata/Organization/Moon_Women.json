        "mainbody": "The Moon Women were a group of Lesser Immortals of the Celestial Bureaucracy, the dominant faith of Kara-Tur.\nThey had the great responsibility of maintaining Heaven itself. They refilled the oil lamps in the Sun, polished the crystal orbs of the stars, and steered the motions of the Moon and the constellations. Since these governed the Kara-Turan calendar, Moon Women were the patron saints of festivals, portents, auspicious moments, and other matters of time.\nMoon Women appeared as young women of slender build and wearing gauzy blue robes. They were often almost transparent.\nIt was believed they prized Mokan River pearls."
