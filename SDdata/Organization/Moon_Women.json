        "mainbody": "The '''Moon Women''' were a group of [[Lesser Immortals]] of the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], the dominant faith of [[Kara-Tur]].\n\nThey had the great responsibility of maintaining [[Celestial Heavens|Heaven]] itself. They refilled the oil lamps in the [[Sun]], polished the crystal orbs of the stars, and steered the motions of the [[Moon]] and the [[constellation]]s. Since these governed the [[Kara-Turan calendar]], Moon Women were the patron saints of festivals, portents, auspicious moments, and other matters of time.\n\nMoon Women appeared as young women of slender build and wearing gauzy blue robes. They were often almost transparent.\n\nIt was believed they prized [[Mokan River pearl]]s."
