The '''Stone Knives''' was a [[Batiri]] [[goblin]] tribe that inhabited the jungles of [[Samarach]] on the [[Wild Coast]] side of the [[Chultan Peninsula]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Members of the Stone Knives tribe were known to use typical Batiri items, weapons, and armor, including a special type of [[arrow]] called ''[[keening reeds]]'' and ''[[onyx spear]]s'', as well as more mundane weapons such as [[kama]] and [[bastard sword]]s. The tribe carved totems that decorated their caverns and the entrance into the lair.

==History==
If Batiri legend was to be believed, the tribe was formed after goblins discovered the ''Heart of the [[Samarlogh]]'', a massive boulder landmark. It possessed some magical properties and when goblins managed to break a piece off it for themselves, the boulder's magics were imbued on the so-called ''[[Shard of the Samarlogh]]''. The shard was shaped into an [[enchanted]] [[shortsword]] and became the tribe's namesake.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the Stone Knives had a lair in the mountains to the east of [[Omgar's Teeth]] from where they raided the shores and ventured deeper into the region's jungles. During that time, the Stone Knives were led by Chieftain [[Zhechrrog]] and a group of matrons and elders, who waged war against the hated Batiri [[Shattered Spear tribe]]. At some point in or shortly before 1373 DR, Stone Knives stole Shattered Spear's namesake revered heirloom, and in retaliation, the Spears drove the Knives out of their previous home in the jungles of Samarlogh.

When the ill-fated vessel named ''[[Vigilant (ship)|Vigilant]]'' crashed onto Omgar's Teeth, Stone Knives raided the wreck, murdering and capturing a handful of survivors of the crash, including [[hin]] Captain [[Lastri Kassireh]] and her First Mate [[Kadjin]]. Captain Kassireh recalled her crew members begging for their lives before being murdered and the screams of Kadjin as he was cooked and devoured by the goblins. When a group of adventurers hired by merchant [[Sa'Sani]] of [[Samargol]] arrived to rescue the survivors, only Lastri Kassireh was still alive. The Chieftain attempted to plead and lie her way out of the situation, but Lastri exposed the goblin's lies. A battle ensued, and many of the tribesmen were slain in the process, including Chieftain Zhechrrog herself.
