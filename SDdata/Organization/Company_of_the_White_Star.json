        "mainbody": "The '''Company of the White Star''' was an [[adventuring company]] active in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "It was started by [[Araevin Teshurr]] to explore the ruins of ancient elven sites.\n\nWhen its members disbanded in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, Araevin gave them all a star-shaped pendant that would act as a conduit in case he needed to call them together again.\n\nThe company was reformed in [[Ches]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, and consisted of Araevin; his partner, [[Ilsevele Miritar]]; former member [[Grayth Holmfast]]; Grayth's squire, [[Brant Rethalshield]]; and [[Maresa Rost]], daughter of former member [[Theleda]].\n\nAfter reforming, the company went searching for ''[[telkiira]]''. Araevin had one in his possession, which he had recovered from the slain mage [[Philaerin]] in [[Tower Reilloch]], and each ''telkiira''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s whereabouts were pointed to by the previous one.<ref> The company located the second ''telkiira'' in an abandoned mage's tower in the [[Forest of Wyrms]] but were ambushed by the [[daemonfey]], who had the help of various [[demon]]ic creatures. In the combat that ensued, Brant was killed, but Araevin used a teleportation spell to escape with his other companions, leaving behind their [[horse]]s and supplies.\n\nAfter returning to [[Evermeet]], the company learned of [[Seiveril Miritar]]'s plans to counter the daemonfey army marching on [[Evereska]], and promptly returned to [[Faer√ªn]] to aid him. They participated in the resulting [[Battle of the Cwm]] on [[Ches 2]], and all emerged unscathed.\n\nThe company marched onwards using the second ''telkiira'' as a guide to the third. From Evereska they used a [[portal]] to the [[Moonwood]] where they headed northeast towards the [[Cold Vale]], coming across the cave of [[Grimlight]], a [[behir]]. The telkiira was located in the cave, and although the party slew Grimlight, they were soon after ambushed by the daemonfey, who took them captive.\n\nThe daemonfey took the company back to their leader, [[Sarya Dlardrageth]], at her hideout at [[Myth Glaurach]], who revealed that the first ''telkiira'' had been planted, and three were needed to find a ''[[selukiira]]'' called the [[Nightstar (selukiira)|Nightstar]], which contained the secrets of [[Aryvandaar]]. Since the daemonfey could not find the ''telkiira'' themselves, Sarya had tricked Araevin into locating them. When Araevin refused to unlock the third ''telkiira'', Sarya had [[Nurthel Floshin]] kill Grayth by stabbing him in the neck, which anguished Araevin, allowing Sarya to enchant him into helping.",
