        "mainbody": "he Company of the White Star was an adventuring company active in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nIt was started by Araevin Teshurr to explore the ruins of ancient elven sites.\nWhen its members disbanded in the , Araevin gave them all a star-shaped pendant that would act as a conduit in case he needed to call them together again.\nThe company was reformed in Ches of the , and consisted of Araevin his partner, Ilsevele Miritar former member Grayth Holmfast Grayths squire, Brant Rethalshield and Maresa Rost, daughter of former member Theleda.\nAfter reforming, the company went searching for telkiira. Araevin had one in his possession, which he had recovered from the slain mage Philaerin in Tower Reilloch, and each telkiiras whereabouts were pointed to by the previous one. The company located the second telkiira in an abandoned mages tower in the Forest of Wyrms but were ambushed by the daemonfey, who had the help of various demonic creatures. In the combat that ensued, Brant was killed, but Araevin used a teleportation spell to escape with his other companions, leaving behind their horses and supplies.\nAfter returning to Evermeet, the company learned of Seiveril Miritars plans to counter the daemonfey army marching on Evereska, and promptly returned to Faer√ªn to aid him. They participated in the resulting Battle of the Cwm on Ches 2, and all emerged unscathed.\nThe company marched onwards using the second telkiira as a guide to the third. From Evereska they used a portal to the Moonwood where they headed northeast towards the Cold Vale, coming across the cave of Grimlight, a behir. The telkiira was located in the cave, and although the party slew Grimlight, they were soon after ambushed by the daemonfey, who took them captive.\nThe daemonfey took the company back to their leader, Sarya Dlardrageth, at her hideout at Myth Glaurach, who revealed that the first telkiira had been planted, and three were needed to find a selukiira called the Nightstar, which contained the secrets of Aryvandaar. Since the daemonfey could not find the telkiira themselves, Sarya had tricked Araevin into locating them. When Araevin refused to unlock the third telkiira, Sarya had Nurthel Floshin kill Grayth by stabbing him in the neck, which anguished Araevin, allowing Sarya to enchant him into helping.\n* Araevin Teshurr\n* Grayth Holmfast\n* Darthen\n* Belmora\n* Theleda Rost\n* Sanidine\n* Ilsevele Miritar\n* Brant Rethalshield\n* Maresa Rost"
