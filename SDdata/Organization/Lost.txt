'''The Lost''' were a group of [[wood elves]] that lived in the [[Border Forest]] during the [[Age of Humanity]] and the [[Era of Upheaval]]. They were isolationist in nature, foregoing the wondrous isle of [[Evermeet]] for their ancestral home in the [[Dalelands]].

==History==
When [[human]] forces expanded logging operations in the [[Tesh Valley]], the woodlands that came to be known as the Border Forest were separated from the larger forest of [[Cormanthor]]. The isolated elves retreated deeper into the forest, separated from their kin.

One of the wood elves, [[Raunaeril|Raunaeril the Rose]], continued to maintain a relationship with the Dalesfolk.

When [[Zhent]] forces took hold in the area around the Border Forest in [[1330 DR]], the elves cut off all contact with the outside world and came to be known as "the Lost".

In [[1369 DR]] a group of adventurers came to the Border Forest, in an effort to free Snowmantle from the grip of the combined forces of the [[Zhentilar]] army and the more-nefarious [[Zhentarim]] agents. Upon their arrival they met the keeper of knowledge for the Lost. This wise old wood elf [[Tanseril]], happened to also be the father of Raunaeril and grandfather of the recently imprisoned Lanseril (whom he regarded as "the half-breed"). While he couldn't allow any of his kin to leave their home, the ancient lorekeeper aided the adventurers in their efforts to save his grandchild by giving them a ''[[scroll]]'' of ''[[conjure nature elemental]]''.
