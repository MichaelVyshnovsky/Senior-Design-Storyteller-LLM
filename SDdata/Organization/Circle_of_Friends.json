        "mainbody": "The '''Circle of Friends''' was a trading cartel active in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Organization": "The Circle of Friends coster was run by [[Jon Archen]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]]. It was one of three major trade cartels granted offices within the [[Temple of Waukeen (Neverwinter)|Temple of Waukeen]] following the [[Shadow War]] in Neverwinter's [[Tyr's Eye]] district.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Circle of Friends was known for its stellar reputation. At the time, the coster was under the leadership of a wealthy Neverwintran nobleman Jon Archen whose son perished in the Shadow War. The Circle of Friends operated under lower profit margins making their methods and prices popular among consumers. Their methods, however, did have some opponents, including certain members of the [[Church of Waukeen]] who thought that discounted goods were beneficial to the consumers of [[Faer√ªn]], but unhealthy for market competition."
