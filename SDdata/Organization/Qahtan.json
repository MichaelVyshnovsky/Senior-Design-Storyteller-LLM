Sheikh Sabkhat of the Mtair Dhafir offered up an alliance between the two tribes their people would share the region for the summer, after which the Qahtan return north to their home. The union between the tribes was bound by the marriage of Saars daughter Ruha to Ajaman, the son of the Qahtani sheikh.\nThat same year, the sheikh of the tribe was approached by Lord Zarud of the Zhentarim, who hoped to forge an \"alliance\" with the tribe. According to Zarud, the Qahtani leader chose not to enter into such an agreement.\nFollowing the refusal, nearly every member of the Qahtan were slaughtered by a night time raid of Zhentarim warriors and their asabi mercenaries. The only known survivor was Ruha, the young Qahtani woman who was hiding the fact she had sorcerous powers, and Kadumi a young warrior who had been traveling on a lone camel ride across the desert as a rite of massage into manhood.\n* Ruha, the Bedine sorceress that became an agent of the Harpers.\n* Kadumi, a young man burdened by being the last warrior of his tribe."
