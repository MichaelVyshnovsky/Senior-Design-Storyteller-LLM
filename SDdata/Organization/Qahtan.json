        "Relationships": "The tribe enjoyed a brief friendship with the [[Mtair Dhafir]] tribe.",
        "History": "In the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, the Qahtan were plagued by no water in their territory of the desert, on the northern sands of [[the Sword]], and traveled south to the lands of the Mtair Dhafir. Sheikh [[Sabkhat]] of the Mtair Dhafir offered up an alliance between the two tribes: their people would share the region for the summer, after which the Qahtan return north to their home. The union between the tribes was bound by the marriage of Sa'ar's daughter [[Ruha]] to [[Ajaman]], the son of the Qahtani sheikh.\n\nThat same year, the sheikh of the tribe was approached by [[El Zarud|Lord Zarud]] of the [[Zhentarim]], who hoped to forge an \"alliance\" with the tribe. According to Zarud, the Qahtani leader chose not to enter into such an agreement.\n\nFollowing the refusal, nearly every member of the Qahtan were slaughtered by a night time raid of Zhentarim warriors and their [[asabi]] mercenaries. The only known survivor was Ruha, the young Qahtani woman who was hiding the fact she had [[sorcerous]] powers, and [[Kadumi]] a young warrior who had been traveling on a lone [[camel]] ride across the desert as a rite of massage into manhood.",
        "Members": "* [[Ruha]], the Bedine [[sorceress]] that became an agent of the [[Harpers]].\n* [[Kadumi]], a young man burdened by being the last warrior of his tribe."
