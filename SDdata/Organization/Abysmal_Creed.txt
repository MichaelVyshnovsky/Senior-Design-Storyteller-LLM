The '''Abysmal Creed''' was one of the major [[illithid]] [[Creed (illithid)|Creeds]] in the Realms. They focused on instilling fear into thrall populations. They were highly efficient at torturing thrall races.<ref name ="DDGttUpp22,80-81"> One such method was the use of the [[Nerve swimmer]].

==Bases==
The Abysmals had a base called the [[Vaults of Terror]] in [[Oryndoll]]. In the city, they were not only known for being able to efficiently cow the thrall population, but they were also known for making decorative masks that captured moments of pure terror upon them, which they sold to whoever would buy them. They worked closely with the [[Venerator Creed]].<ref name ="DDGttUpp22,80-81"/>
