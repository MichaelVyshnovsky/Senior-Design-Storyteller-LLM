The '''Many-Fanged Serpent''' was a mercantile secret society that operated out of the town of [[Purskul]] in the [[Zehoarastria]] region of [[Amn]], several centuries prior to the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The Many-Fanged Serpent held clandestine meetings in the [[Owlroost Head Inn]] of Purskul. Back then, the inn bore a different name, and the phrase [[Owlroost Head (hill)|"Owlroost Head"]], the name of a certain hill, was used as the secret society's password. The meetings of the Many-Fanged Serpent were attended by merchants and laborers and planned attacks against unjust treatment and price-gouging by the visiting traders, merchants, and corrupt rulers. These planned actions were often referred to as "Serpent striking."

As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Many-Fanged Serpent was presumed disbanded, but every time Purskul was shaken by vandalisms, mercantilism-related murders, or other trade disturbances, the locals attributed these acts to the Striking Serpent. The swearing "By the Serpent!" remained very common in Purskul.

It was believed that the largest dining hall of the Owlroost Head Inn was constructed atop a buried cache of money stolen by the Many-Fanged Serpent.
