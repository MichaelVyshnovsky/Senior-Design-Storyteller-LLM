The '''Triumvirate''' were a group of three [[phaerimm]] who managed to escape [[Anauroch]] through a breach in the [[Sharn Wall]]. They conquered the [[beholder]] city of [[Ooltul]] in the [[Northdark]].

==Activities==
In their continuing war against the beholders, the Triumvirate learned from the still-trapped phaerimm their ancient methods for creating a [[beholderkin]] known as a [[gouger]]. They also created miniature, mutated beholderkin known as [[eyeball]]s. However, the Triumvirate allowed their mutant creatures to stray out and across the [[Underdark]].

By [[1372 DR]], they plotted to release the other phaerimm still trapped in Anauroch.
