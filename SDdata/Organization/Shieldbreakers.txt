The Shieldbreakers were an ogre mercenary company based in the Lands of Intrigue.
These ogres were known for being unbiased and honorable.
The mercenaries always refused contacts involving the murder of unarmed foes.
The Shieldbreaker base, Shieldbreaker Citadel, was located south of the Deepwash in Erlkazar. In the High Peaks, the Shieldbreakers made their home in the village of Rivenshield.
Loyal to their name, the Shieldbreakers never used shields in battle. The group preferred to wield two-handed weapons, like bardiches.
The Shieldbreakers were formed when a group of ogres refused to kill unarmed humans despite the orders of their chief. Around 1358 DR, the Shieldbreakers made an alliance with the barony of Ahlarkhem to protect Duhlnarim against King Ertyk Uhl and his Starrock goblin horde.
