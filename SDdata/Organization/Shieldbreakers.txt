The '''Shieldbreakers''' were an [[ogre]] mercenary company based in the [[Lands of Intrigue]].

==Organization==
These ogres were known for being unbiased and honorable.

==Activities==
The mercenaries always refused contacts involving the murder of unarmed foes.

==Base of Operations==
The Shieldbreaker base, [[Shieldbreaker Citadel]], was located south of the [[Deepwash]] in [[Erlkazar]]. In the [[High Peaks]], the Shieldbreakers made their home in the village of [[Rivenshield]].

==Possessions==
Loyal to their name, the Shieldbreakers never used [[shield]]s in battle. The group preferred to wield two-handed weapons, like [[bardiche]]s.

==History==
The Shieldbreakers were formed when a group of ogres refused to kill unarmed [[human]]s despite the orders of their chief. Around [[1358 DR]], the Shieldbreakers made an alliance with the barony of [[Ahlarkhem]] to protect [[Duhlnarim]] against King [[Ertyk Uhl]] and his [[Starrock]] [[goblin]] horde.

==Members==
;[[Koranan Splitoak]]: Veteran leader

==Prices==
* 50 [[gp]] per day for their services.
