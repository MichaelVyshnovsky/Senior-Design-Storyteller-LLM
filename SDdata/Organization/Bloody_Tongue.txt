The Bloody Tongue were a tribe of orcs active in the Vast in the 7 century DR.
In the Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR, the orcs of the Bloody Tongue tribe joined a horde of orcs that engulfed the dwarven kingdom of Roldilar in the lands later known as the Vast. At Viperstongue Ford, the Bloody Tongue battled the elf hero Beluar and his forces, but were defeated and forced into a rout. As the sun set, Beluars forces pursued the orcs north and east into an area of rolling, rugged hills. Finally, Beluars forces chased the remaining orcs up the North Road to the village of Maskyrs Eye. Beluar himself killed the last orc on the road in front of the village smithy at dawn.
The smith of Maskyrs Eye at the time had the opportunity to examine the Bloody Tongues armor, and found it poor quality, comparable to the basic hardware known as blackwork.
