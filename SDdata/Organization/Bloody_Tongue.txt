The '''Bloody Tongue''' were a tribe of [[orc]]s active in [[the Vast]] in the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/The Everwinking Eye: A Closer Look at Maskyr's Eye|25}}

==History==
In the [[649 DR|Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR]], the orcs of the Bloody Tongue tribe joined a horde of orcs that engulfed the [[dwarf|dwarven]] kingdom of [[Roldilar]] in the lands later known as the Vast. At [[Viperstongue Ford]], the Bloody Tongue battled the [[elf]] hero [[Beluar]] and his forces, but were defeated and forced into a rout. As the sun set, Beluar's forces pursued the orcs north and east into an [[Beluar's Hunt|area of rolling, rugged hills]]. Finally, Beluar's forces chased the remaining orcs up the [[North Road]] to the village of [[Maskyr's Eye]]. Beluar himself killed the last orc on the road in front of the village smithy at dawn.

The smith of Maskyr's Eye at the time had the opportunity to examine the Bloody Tongue's armor, and found it poor quality, comparable to the basic hardware known as blackwork.
