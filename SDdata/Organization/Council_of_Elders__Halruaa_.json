        "mainbody": "The '''Council of Elders''' of [[Halruaa]], whose individual members were referred to as '''Halruaan elders''', It was an immensely diverse collective of powerful,\n\nAs of the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]], the council was overseen by the nation's Wizard-King, [[Zalathorm Kirkson]], whose reign began in [[1262 DR]].",
        "Members": "Only arcane casters were eligible to join the ranks of the Council of Elders, the vast majority of which were [[wizards]]. Other spellcasters were not respected in Halruaan society, so few of them ever stayed in their homeland long enough to attain the level of talent necessary to become a member of the Council.\n\nAlthough the 400-plus members of the council  were proven [[wizard]]s, being an [[arcane spellcaster]] was not enough to hold authority in Halruaa. After passing a [[divination|divinatory]] background check, they had to prove their mastery of [[the Art]] with unique displays of arcane force and knowledge, enough to make them famous all across the land. \n\nSuch individuals that achieved this feat, and earned the title of a \"Halruaan Elder\", were granted permission to participate in the nation's revered and prestigious ruling council. This assembly served as the court of the Netyarch, where the group discussed the official policies and important matters of the country with the head of state.",
        "Activities": {
            "Meetings": "Council meetings were conducted by Zalathorm, often facilitated by his unique ''[[crystal orb]]'' that allowed him to contact any member regardless of their location on [[Toril]]. Most of the time only half of the elders attended meetings and at least thirty nine council members were required for a meeting to occur. Except in the most dire of circumstances only a tenth of council were required to participate in order to have a successful vote.\n\nIf an issue so warranted, a special vote was called and a magical summons sent to each elder of the council to return to the [[Netyarch's palace|palace]] of the Netyarch in [[Halarahh]]. Although some time was given for all the councilors to arrive, those that couldn't had to live with the critical decisions made in their absence."

        "Abilities": "Through their research and exploration of arcane knowledge in Faer√ªn and beyond, the elders of the Council became even more masterful spellcasters. They were experts at manipulating [[metamagic]], could engage in [[Halruaa]]n [[circle magic]] and often maintained a repertoire of signature [[spell]]s."
