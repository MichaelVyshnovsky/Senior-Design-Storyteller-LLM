        "mainbody": "he Circle of Greater Powers, also known as the Circle of Twelve Powers, was the coalition of twelve Greater Powers of the Faer√ªnian pantheon. These mighty beings directed the actions of their fellow gods to keep and maintain the Balance, in accordance with the will of the overgod Ao.\nThe Circle did not hold regular conclaves, but did meet when problems arose that concerned them all.\nThe twelve greater powers met within the Pavilion of Cynosure which was set within a unique demiplane within the greater Ethereal plane.\nAt some point in their history, the Circle of Greater Powers banned members of the pantheon from dealing with Kezef the Chaos Hound. They magically bound the beast within the depths of Pandemonium.\nIn the , the Circle held a series of sessions to discuss and deal with the god Cyric. Cyric was believed to have slain the goddess Leira and had created a magical book called the Cyrinishad, that could convert readers to the Cyricist faith. Tyr offered a mere warning to the Mad God, but Mystra illegally stripped him of his ability to cast magic.\nThe Council met once again to address both Cyrics crime of releasing Kezef, and Mystras unlawful seizure of magic from Cyric. They found that due to the fact each god had recently ascended from mortality, they would be forgiven so long as they made right their offenses. Cyric was directed to participate in the  Circles meetings and abide by their decisions, and Mystra was forced to restore to Cyric his access to the Weave.\nIn the end Cyric, continue to work against the gods and eventually faced uprising within his own divine realm. He blamed the Circle for his own failings and cursed them as his enemies from then onwards.\n* Chauntea, the goddess of cultivation.\n* Cyric, the god of strife.\n* Lathander, the god of renewal and dawn.\n* Mystra, the goddess of magic.\n* Oghma, the god of knowledge.\n* Shar, the goddess of the night.\n* Sune, the goddess of beauty.\n* Talos, the god of storms.\n* Tempus, the god of war.\n* Tyr, the god of justice.\n* Kelemvor, god of the dead.\n* Silvanus, god of nature."
