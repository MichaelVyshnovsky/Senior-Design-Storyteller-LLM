The '''Confluence''' were a loose, secret association of [[half-dragon|half–]][[steel dragon]]s based in [[Waterdeep]] with the purpose of eliminating all [[shapechanger]]s that tried to enter the City of Splendors. Its primary enemy in [[1374 DR]] was the [[Unseen]].

==Relationships==
Their allies were the noble families of [[Bladesemmer]], [[Tesper]], and [[House Thongolir]], who raised the half-steel offspring, the [[Harpers]] and the offshoot [[Moonstars]], plus the local [[church of Selûne]] at the [[House of the Moon]]. Other enemies were the church of [[Malar]] and the [[People of the Black Blood]].

==Membership==
Members had to be sponsored by a patron, usually one or both of their parents and were often called upon to perform services for these patrons. They also hired adventurers to perform various missions for the group, though they never revealed their own identities.

Members traveled the city in disguise, whether magical or conventional, to hide their nature from passers-by.

==History==
The Confluence originated with a pair of [[steel dragon]]s, [[Auntyrlothtor]] and [[Quituryte]]. During the [[Harpstar Wars]] of [[1182 DR]] – [[1222 DR]], they fought in Waterdeep against the [[malaugrym]] together with a group of noble women. In time, the two brothers produced half-breed offspring that were raised in secret by the noble families of the original dames, contrary to the custom of the Waterdhavian nobility to not allow half-dragons in their families.

In [[1254 DR]], the half-steel nobles had reached maturity and the malaugrym subtly attacked Waterdeep again. Thanks to the experience of the veterans of the Harpstar Wars, the menace was stopped but they understood that they needed to remain vigilant to stop a future resurgence. Thus they founded the Confluence to control and eliminate all shapechangers entering the city.

In the decades since, they ruined more than a dozen malaugrym plots. The climax was in [[1291 DR]] when the Confluence exposed the secret sorcerers guild of the [[Eyes of the Golden Hawk]] as sons of [[Malaug]], stopping an insidious ten-year-long plot to supplant the [[Lords of Waterdeep]].

In [[1331 DR]], they discovered that high-ranking members of the [[Master Mariners Guild]] were a group of [[wereshark]]s and stopped their criminal plan.

The war with the [[Unseen]] started in [[1363 DR]]. The Confluence frequently came into conflict with the Unseen: one such battle was the cause of the [[Rat Hills Conflagration]], another time they manipulated [[Volothamp Geddarm]] into unmasking the [[doppelganger]] courtesans of the [[Hanging Lantern]] festhall, and they once reported to the Lords that the pirate leader the [[Hlaavin|Black Admiral]] was a doppelganger. The only shapechanger tolerated in the city was [[Amarune]], who posed as Lady [[Nael Irlingstar]], but only as a personal request of the famous [[Elminster Aumar]].
