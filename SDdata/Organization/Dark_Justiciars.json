        "Membership": "It was rumored that in order to gain admittance to the order of the Dark Justiciars, a Sharran supplicant had to have killed a priest or priestess of [[Selûne]]. This was in fact quite true, but the process was a little more involved than that.\n\nFor those Dark Justiciars at the [[Gauntlet of Shar]] temple in the [[Underdark]], when a Sharran supplicant wanted to become a Dark Justiciar, they would require approval from their superior in the church. With this granted, they would travel to the Gauntlet of Shar and undergo trials to test their stealth, strength, and wisdom. After all trials were passed, they were permitted to go into the inner sanctum to spill the blood of a Selûnite as the ultimate sacrifice, and so become a Dark Justiciar. However, with the fall of Thorm's Dark Justiciars and the ''shadow curse'', the Gauntlet of Shar fell into ruin in the late 14{{th}} century and this path of becoming a Dark Justiciar was gone with it.",

Now, that fool's soul is Shar's to torment for eternity.\n| source = From Inosencia's diary\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}\nThese executors of Shar's will served the Dark Lady over a millennium before the [[Era of Upheaval]], dating as far back as the ancient empire of [[Netheril]].\n\nIn [[Procampur]]'s [[Port District]] on [[Uktar 17]], the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the Sharran priestess Inosencia Cielian murdered [[Justina Palfry]], a Selûnite priestess visiting from [[Ravens Bluff]], solely to become a Dark Justicar.{{Cite organized play/LC/A Friendly Suggestion|36,40}}\n\nAt some point, a former [[Selûnite]] [[paladin]] named [[Ketheric Thorm]] turned to the worship of Shar and became her [[chosen]]. At Shar's command, Ketheric built the [[Gauntlet of Shar]] for training and initiating faithful Sharrans as Dark Justiciars.\n\nSome time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1391}}, Ketheric Thorm raised an army of Dark Justiciars beneath the Thorm family mausoleum. He and his followers managed to release the ''[[shadow curse]]'' across the lands surrounding [[Moonrise Towers]], before they were turned away by an allied force of [[Harpers]], Selûnites, and [[druid]]s of the [[Emerald Grove]], including the hero [[Jaheira]] and Master [[Halsin]].\n\nFollowing Thorm's turn to Shar, Raphael was contacted by the architect of Moonrise Towers to destroy the Dark Justiciars. The [[devil]] [[Yurgir]] slaughtered all but one Dark Justiciar. He was bound by a contract from [[Raphael]], represented as a song, to \"spill all the blood sworn to the night\" and \"leave no Justiciar alive to obey.\" Though he believed he fulfilled the contract, somehow it still stood, and he remained trapped in the [[Grand Mausoleum]]. In fact, the last remaining Justiciar, [[Lyrthindor]], guarded Lady Shar's temple and kept the faith alive even after the other Dark Justiciars were exterminated. Uniquely, Lyrthindor performed a ritual, also from Raphael, that transformed him into a swarm of [[rat]]s. Each rat retained fragments of Lyrthindor's memories and identity, and together they shared who he once was. Despite their fragmented state, they continued to exist, offering a treacherous bargain to those who encountered them.",
