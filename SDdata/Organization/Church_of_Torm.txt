Gauntleted hand
The church of Torm, also known as the True and Loyal as well as the Watchful Guardians, as well as the god of courage and self-sacrifice. having grown in prevalence and influence as Torm became a greater power during the Era of Upheaval.
The faith itself was referred to as the True Faith or the Unbending Way of Torm. Collectively, Torms clergy were dubbed the Tormtar or Tormish, while his followers were known as Tormish, or Tormar. 
The tenets of Torms church involved obedience to duty and loyalty to ones allies. Tormish clergy and laypeople were directed to uphold virtuousness, maintain order throughout the Realms, and strike out against corrupt and evil forces. Serving others in these causes was the truest path to deliverance of the spirit and the best means to honor Torm himself. Disobedience was to be punished quickly and severely.
All followers of Torm were expected to demonstrate devotion to their faith, their family, their superiors, and all goodly beings of the Realms.
Torm requires the following
* Respect and enforce the law, and honor your traditions.
* Demonstrate truthfulness, loyalty, and steadfast devotion to a rightful cause.
* Do not flinch in the execution of your duty, no matter what the consequence.
By 1480 DR, the creed of Torms church dictated "Be loyal, obedient, and dutiful, up-holding laws, rules, and the most ethical stances through both unwavering support and armed vigilance. Seek corruption constantly and stamp it out. Give swift but brutal death to traitors. Where laws are unjust or flawed, urge improvements and alternatives rather than a confusion of ever more laws. Train law keepers and judges to be just, and watch over them to ensure that they perform with impartiality. Serve with all your heart as well as all your reason. Every failure of duty diminishes the Loyal Fury every success empowers him and brightens the world. Be vigilant always. Question your actions and stances rather than sinking into the sin of self-righteousness. Torm watches you, and expects you to watch and guide others."
Followers of Torm conveyed gratitude for the opportunity serve the mortals of the Realms. They did not act for personal acclaim accept any material rewards but rather for the personal fulfillment of making the world a safer and more just place to live. Anyone found guilty of garnering wealth while carrying out the churchs tenets would be offered penance for minor infractions but would be immediately excommunicated in other instances.
The church did not consider the hoarding of arms and weaponry as inherently wicked but abstained from doing so as a matter of practical caution.
While some individuals resented the overbearing influence the Tormish church held over their daily lives, many accepted it as a necessary burden to live a life free from oppression.
Torms church was organized into three tiers, separated from the others by both the caliber and duration of service to the faith.
The highest tier of Torms church comprised the Tormtar, and included the following titles in descending order (along with associated color robes or pigmented armor) Champion (dusky purple), Vanguardier (amethyst), Knight (deep blue), Guardian (sky blue), Enforcer (deep green), Loyan (pale green), Watchful Venturer (yellow), Vigilant (orange), Warden (dark amber), Faithblade (rose red), Anduran (crimson), and Unproven (uncolored), the faiths novices. Other titles were bestowed upon Tormtar that undertook specific duties. These included Priest Inquisitor, High Priest, Templemaster, Seneschal, Doorwarden, Revered Messenger, and Patrol Captain.
For a time following the death of Tyr, the title of High Justiciar was incorporated into the hierarchy of the church.
The second tier of the church encompassed the numerous knightly orders that undertook charges and quests in his name. Regardless of the order of which they were a member, these holy champions were collectively known as the Swords of Torm.
The third and lowest-ranking tier of the church included all the laypeople that venerated Torm as their patron deity. This group included folks from all walks of life, including many soldiers and city officials. Despite not having membership within they Tormish clergy, they were expected to uphold the tenets of the faith and offer regular tithing to their local temple or shrine.
* Girded Healers Members of this order worshiped both Torm and Ilmater. The primary purpose of this order was to heal those touched by war or the Spellplague.
* The Evenhands of Everlund, an upstanding order of knights based in Luruar protects the civilized lands of the north. Commanded by the Lord of Everlund, the paladin of Torm, Kel Moorwalker.
* Loyal Order of Innocents, a group of Tethyrian knights that was founded by Queen Zaranda Star during the mid-14th century DR. 
* Order of the Golden Lion, a holy order of knights and paladins founded after the Time of Troubles that focused their collective efforts on fulfilling the churchs Penance of Duty and repairing the Weave. 
* Paladins of the Hand, an order of twelve Tormtar paladins that were active during the 12 century DR.
* Trueblades, an order of crusaders based in Tantras responsible for damage control during warfare and disasters.
* Sons of Light, an order of knights that once existed during the early 8th century DR and fought in the Weeping War.
About two out of five members of Torms church were specialty priests, Clerics, crusaders, and paladins, composed the rest of his clergy. These Tormtar were also accompanied in their services by a number of divine champions and disciples.
Tormtar clergy set out to overthrow corrupt officials that garnered positions of power by unscrupulous means, and offer ethical alternatives in their place. They rooted out unjust and racist laws from the realms in which they were active and stymied efforts by leaders to conquer neighboring lands. When necessary, they were to exact lethal judgement against those that betrayed the trust of others. To accomplish their aims, the clergy integrated themselves into political organizations and governments across the Realms, except for those run by despots and tyrants. 
Additionally, regularly provided aid and resources to all manner of valorous knights, dutiful guardians, and honest courtiers in the nations across Faerûn. 
Followers of Torm that took up the adventuring lifestyle were granted much freedom while questing, but were required to regularly report back to church officials. They were dispatched as explorers to learn more about the realms outside their spheres of influence. They were directed to offer significant tithings, upwards of half the riches they acquired during their travels.
Following the churchs actions taken during the Time of Troubles, Torm himself directed his faithful undertake acts of penitence, in response to their collective moral failings. From that time on, all of his followers would undertake the Penance of Duty, three debts that were to regularly be repaid to the folks of the Realms.
* Debt of Persecution In recompense for persecuting members of other faiths, Torms followers would regularly aid the clergies of other morally-upstanding churches.
* Debt of Dereliction To answer for failing to route corruptive forces, clergy members must actively take up arms against the churches of Bane, Cyric, Iyachtu Xvim, and the Zhentarim.
* Debt of Destruction In response to the damage inflicted upon the Weave during the Time of Troubles, all of Torms faithful were ordered to report any areas of dead or wild magic were to be reported, and all efforts made to assist in their restoration.
Torms followers offered a specific litany of prayers to their god at dawn, noon, dusk, and finally at midnight. They would make additional prayers as warranted, such as in the case of great personal need or crisis. Clerics specifically prayed for their spells at dawn.
Clergy members carried out several different rituals, one on a recurring basis, and the others on special occasions. Three special rituals were the minimal requirements for the priesthood. The ritual of Torms Table involved offering a bountiful meal to someone in need once every two months, to be enjoyed while the offering priest fasted. Whenever a layperson became a full-fledged priest they completed the ritual of Investiture, and then fulfilled the Holy Vigil whenever they ascended in rank within the churchs hierarchy.
The church of Torm celebrated a few different holidays that were marked on the Calendar of Harptos.
* Eleasis 13 marked the Divine Death, honoring Torms epic and ultimately fatal battle between Bane during the Avatar Crisis.
* Marpenoth 15 was gleefully celebrated as the True Resurrection, when Torm was restored to the Faerûnian pantheon following the death of his avatar.
* Tormish followers celebrated Shieldmeet every four years by reaffirming their oaths of service and solidifying other commitments for others.
Initiates of Torm were able to channel the power of their faith when striking against of the followers of their gods most-hated foes, namely those of Bane, Cyric, or their progenitors, Bhaal, Myrkul, and Iyachtu Xvim.
Torms faith was prevalent throughout the Dalelands, the Shining Lands, Tethyr, Ulgarth, the Vast, especially within the city of Tantras, and even became the state religion of Elturgard upon its founding in the 1430s DR.
Some scholars speculated that Chalsembyr, the ancient kingdom Torm ruled over as a mortal in the -4 century DR, was located somewhere within the Border Kingdoms south of the Lake of Steam.
There was a small village on the Sword Coast named Torms Hand. Due to the Spellplague that led to the deaths of Tyr and Helm, Torms faith spread in Neverwinter of the Sword Coast North.
Temples of Torm were often constructed out of white granite, set upon the upper slops of mountains or other peaks that offered a commanding view over the surrounding landscape. These impenetrable keeps were designed to embody Torms stately defiance against the evils of the world. They were often made of white granite and decorated with statues of lions and knights in gleaming armor, adorned with mementos taken from the dutiful Tormtar fallen heroes.
Some of the most prominent or famous churches of Torm included

Torms holy symbol comprised a gauntleted right hand, palm held upwards or extended forward, known as the Hand Resolute. To Torms followers it symbolized restraint and temperance The Hand Resolute slightly changed by 1479 DR. By 1489 DR, the symbol became a white right gauntlet (a white gauntlet made for the right hand). The Tormish temples, civic structures, and the homes of the faithful are often decorated with the Hand Resolute images as a contrast reminder of the principle the just and true must pause for action to judge if their intention upholds Torms ideals.
