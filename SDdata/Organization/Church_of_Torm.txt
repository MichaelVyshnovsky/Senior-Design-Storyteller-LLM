The '''church of Torm''', also known as the '''True and Loyal''' as well as the '''Watchful Guardians''', as well as the god of courage and self-sacrifice. having grown in prevalence and influence as Torm became a [[greater power]] during the [[Era of Upheaval]].

The faith itself was referred to as the ''True Faith'' or the ''Unbending Way of Torm''. Collectively, [[:Category:Worshipers of Torm|Torm's clergy]] were dubbed the ''Tormtar'' or ''Tormish'', while his followers were known as ''Tormish'', or ''Tormar''. 

{{Quote|[The church is] the shield that protects us all, good and bad, so as to be ourselves and not oppressed slaves.|Saying among the common folks of the Realms.}}
==Dogma==
The tenets of Torm's church involved obedience to duty and loyalty to one's allies. Tormish clergy and laypeople were directed to uphold virtuousness, maintain order throughout the Realms, and strike out against corrupt and evil forces. Serving others in these causes was the truest path to deliverance of the spirit and the best means to honor Torm himself. Disobedience was to be punished quickly and severely.

All followers of Torm were expected to demonstrate devotion to their faith, their family, their superiors, and all [[good]]ly beings of the Realms.

Torm requires the following:

* ''Respect and enforce the law, and honor your traditions.''
* ''Demonstrate truthfulness, loyalty, and steadfast devotion to a rightful cause.''
* ''Do not flinch in the execution of your duty, no matter what the consequence.''
By [[1480 DR]], the creed of Torm's church dictated: "''Be loyal, obedient, and dutiful, up-holding laws, rules, and the most ethical stances through both unwavering support and armed vigilance. Seek corruption constantly and stamp it out. Give swift but brutal death to traitors. Where laws are unjust or flawed, urge improvements and alternatives rather than a confusion of ever more laws. Train law keepers and judges to be just, and watch over them to ensure that they perform with impartiality. Serve with all your heart as well as all your reason. Every failure of duty diminishes the Loyal Fury; every success empowers him and brightens the world. Be vigilant always. Question your actions and stances rather than sinking into the sin of self-righteousness. Torm watches you, and expects you to watch and guide others.''"

===Attitudes===
{{Quote|Salvation may be found through service. Every failure of duty diminishes Torm and every success adds to his luster. Strive to maintain law and order. Obey your masters with alert judgement and anticipation. Stand ever alert against corruption. Strike quickly and forcefully against rot in the hearts of mortals. Bring painful, quick death to traitors. Question unjust laws by suggesting improvement or alternatives, not additional laws. Your fourfold duties are to faith, family, masters, and all good beings of Faerun.|Excerpt from Torm's dogma. (1372 DR)}}
Followers of Torm conveyed gratitude for the opportunity serve the mortals of the Realms. They did not act for personal acclaim accept any material rewards but rather for the personal fulfillment of making the world a safer and more just place to live. Anyone found guilty of garnering wealth while carrying out the church's tenets would be offered penance for minor infractions but would be immediately excommunicated in other instances.

The church did not consider the hoarding of arms and weaponry as inherently wicked but abstained from doing so as a matter of practical caution.

While some individuals resented the overbearing influence the Tormish church held over their daily lives, many accepted it as a necessary burden to live a life free from oppression.

==Organization==
Torm's church was organized into three tiers, separated from the others by both the caliber and duration of service to the faith.

===Titles===
The highest tier of Torm's church comprised the Tormtar, and included the following titles in descending order (along with associated color [[robe]]s or pigmented [[armor]]): Champion (''dusky purple''), Vanguardier (''amethyst''), Knight (''deep blue''), Guardian (''sky blue''), Enforcer (''deep green''), Loyan (''pale green''), Watchful Venturer (''yellow''), Vigilant (''orange''), Warden (''dark amber''), Faithblade (''rose red''), Anduran (''crimson''), and Unproven (''uncolored''), the faith's novices. Other titles were bestowed upon Tormtar that undertook specific duties. These included: Priest Inquisitor, High Priest, Templemaster, Seneschal, Doorwarden, Revered Messenger, and Patrol Captain.

For a time following the death of [[Tyr]], the title of High Justiciar was incorporated into the hierarchy of the church.

The second tier of the church encompassed the numerous [[Church of Torm#Knightly Orders|knightly orders]] that undertook charges and quests in his name. Regardless of the order of which they were a member, these holy champions were collectively known as the Swords of Torm.

The third and lowest-ranking tier of the church included all the laypeople that venerated Torm as their patron deity. This group included folks from all walks of life, including many soldiers and city officials. Despite not having membership within they Tormish clergy, they were expected to uphold the tenets of the faith and offer regular tithing to their local temple or shrine.

===Orders===

* [[Girded Healers]]: Members of this order worshiped both Torm and Ilmater. The primary purpose of this order was to heal those touched by war or the [[Spellplague]].{{Cite dragon/381/Channel Divinity: Champions of Torm|93-94}}

====Knightly Orders====
* [[The Evenhands of Everlund]], an upstanding order of knights based in [[Luruar]] protects the civilized lands of the north. Commanded by the Lord of Everlund, the paladin of Torm, [[Kel Moorwalker]].
* [[Loyal Order of Innocents]], a group of [[Tethyr]]ian knights that was founded by Queen [[Zaranda Star]] during the mid-14<sup>th</sup> century [[DR]]. 
* [[Order of the Golden Lion]], a holy order of knights and paladins founded after the [[Time of Troubles]] that focused their collective efforts on fulfilling the church's [[Church of Torm#Penance of Duty|Penance of Duty]] and repairing the [[Weave]]. 
* [[Paladins of the Hand]], an order of twelve Tormtar paladins that were active during the 12{{th}} century DR.
* [[Trueblades]], an order of [[Crusader|crusaders]] based in [[Tantras]] responsible for damage control during warfare and disasters.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades}}
* [[Sons of Light]], an order of knights that once existed during the early 8<sup>th</sup> century DR and fought in the [[Weeping War]].

===Classes===
About two out of five members of Torm's church were [[specialty priest]]s, Clerics, [[crusader]]s, and [[paladin]]s, composed the rest of his clergy. These Tormtar were also accompanied in their services by a number of [[divine champion]]s and [[divine disciple|disciples]].

==Activities==
{{Quote|The Tormites are the wagging finger in all of our lives.|King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], of [[Cormyr]].}}{{Quote|Lord Torm walks among us. He is all. Our god sets the hours of the day, the loyalty  in your heart, the reason in your head.|Tormite's common phrase during the [[Time of Troubles]].}}
Tormtar clergy set out to overthrow corrupt officials that garnered positions of power by unscrupulous means, and offer ethical alternatives in their place. They rooted out unjust and racist laws from the realms in which they were active and stymied efforts by leaders to conquer neighboring lands. When necessary, they were to exact lethal judgement against those that betrayed the trust of others. To accomplish their aims, the clergy integrated themselves into political organizations and governments across the Realms, except for those run by despots and tyrants. 

Additionally, regularly provided aid and resources to all manner of valorous knights, dutiful guardians, and honest courtiers in the nations across [[Faer√ªn]]. 

Followers of Torm that took up the [[adventurer|adventuring]] lifestyle were granted much freedom while questing, but were required to regularly report back to church officials. They were dispatched as explorers to learn more about the realms outside their spheres of influence. They were directed to offer significant tithings, upwards of half the riches they acquired during their travels.

===Penance of Duty===
Following the [[Church of Torm#Time of Troubles|church's actions]] taken during the [[Time of Troubles]], Torm himself directed his faithful undertake acts of penitence, in response to their collective moral failings. From that time on, all of his followers would undertake the Penance of Duty, three debts that were to regularly be repaid to the folks of the Realms.

* Debt of Persecution: In recompense for persecuting members of other faiths, Torm's followers would regularly aid the clergies of other morally-upstanding churches.
* Debt of Dereliction: To answer for failing to route corruptive forces, clergy members must actively take up arms against the [[church of Bane|churches of Bane]], [[church of Cyric|Cyric]], [[church of Iyachtu Xvim|Iyachtu Xvim]], and the [[Zhentarim]].
* Debt of Destruction: In response to the damage inflicted upon [[the Weave]] during the Time of Troubles, all of Torm's faithful were ordered to report any areas of [[Dead-magic zone|dead]] or [[wild magic]] were to be reported, and all efforts made to assist in their restoration.

==Rituals==
Torm's followers offered a specific litany of prayers to their god at dawn, noon, dusk, and finally at midnight. They would make additional prayers as warranted, such as in the case of great personal need or crisis. Clerics specifically prayed for their [[divine magic|spells]] at dawn.

Clergy members carried out several different [[ritual]]s, one on a recurring basis, and the others on special occasions. Three special rituals were the minimal requirements for the priesthood. The ritual of [[Torm's Table]] involved offering a bountiful meal to someone in need once every two months, to be enjoyed while the offering priest fasted. Whenever a layperson became a full-fledged priest they completed the ritual of [[Investiture]], and then fulfilled the [[Holy Vigil]] whenever they ascended in rank within the church's hierarchy.

==Celebrations==
The church of Torm celebrated a few different holidays that were marked on the [[Calendar of Harptos]].

* [[Eleasis 13]] marked the [[Divine Death]], honoring Torm's epic and ultimately fatal battle between [[Bane]] during the [[Avatar Crisis]].
* [[Marpenoth 15]] was gleefully celebrated as the [[True Resurrection]], when Torm was restored to the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon]] following the death of his avatar.
* Tormish followers celebrated [[Shieldmeet]] every four years by reaffirming their oaths of service and solidifying other commitments for others.

Initiates of Torm were able to channel the power of their faith when striking against of the followers of their god's most-hated foes, namely those of Bane, Cyric, or their progenitors, [[Bhaal]], [[Myrkul]], and [[Iyachtu Xvim]].

==Base of Operations==
===Regions===
Torm's faith was prevalent throughout the [[Dalelands]], the [[Shining Lands]], [[Tethyr]], [[Ulgarth]], [[the Vast]], especially within the city of [[Tantras]], and even became the state religion of [[Elturgard]] upon its founding in the 1430s DR.

Some scholars speculated that [[Chalsembyr]], the ancient kingdom Torm ruled over as a mortal in the -4{{th}} century DR, was located somewhere within the [[Border Kingdoms]] south of the [[Lake of Steam]].

There was a small village on the [[Sword Coast]] named [[Torm's Hand]].{{Cite adventurers league/Hellfire Requiem|4}} Due to the [[Spellplague]] that led to the deaths of [[Tyr]] and [[Helm]], Torm's faith spread in [[Neverwinter]] of the [[Sword Coast North]].{{Cite dragon/381/Channel Divinity: Champions of Torm|92}}

===Temples===
Temples of Torm were often constructed out of white [[granite]], set upon the upper slops of mountains or other peaks that offered a commanding view over the surrounding landscape. These impenetrable keeps were designed to embody Torm's stately defiance against the evils of the world. They were often made of [[Granite|white granite]] and decorated with statues of [[Lion|lions]] and knights in gleaming armor, adorned with mementos taken from the dutiful Tormtar fallen heroes.

Some of the most prominent or famous churches of Torm included:
* [[House of the Hand]], the temple in [[Procampur]].
* [[Temple of the Highest]], Torm's temple in [[Elturel]] that managed to survive [[the Descent]].
* [[Temple of Torm's Coming]], the famous temple in Tantras that housed the [[High Council of Torm|High Council]], and became a site of pilgrimage for Torm's faithful.

Other temples could be found in [[Citadel of the Eagle|Eagle Peak]], [[Hawk's Nest]], [[Orvyltar]], [[Teziir]], [[Torm's Hand]] near [[Baldur's Gate]],{{Cite adventurers league/Hellfire Requiem|9}} and [[Weatherstone Keep]].{{Cite adventurers league/Ruined Prospects|2}}

Shrines of Torm could be found in [[Baldur's Gate]], the [[High Hall (Elturel)|High Hall]] of [[Elturel]], [[Eshpurta]], [[Hillsfar]], [[House of Loyalty|Ravens Bluff]], [[Scornubel]], and [[Urmlaspyr]].

==Equipment, Spells, and Relics==
Torm's [[holy symbol]] comprised a [[gauntlet]]ed right hand, palm held upwards or extended forward, known as the ''Hand Resolute''. To Torm's followers it symbolized restraint and temperance The Hand Resolute slightly changed by [[1479 DR]]. By [[1489 DR]], the symbol became a white right gauntlet (a white gauntlet made for the right hand). The Tormish temples, civic structures, and the homes of the faithful are often decorated with the Hand Resolute images as a contrast reminder of the principle: the just and true must pause for action to judge if their intention upholds Torm's ideals.

Tormish ''[[faith token]]s'' allowed the bearers to cast the spells ''[[guidance]]'' and ''[[virtue]]''. 

===Dress===

[[File:Half-orc PHB5e.jpg|left|thumb|A Tormtar paladin with the ''[[shield of vigilance|symbol of Torm]],'' a ''[[Holy avenger|Holy Avenger]]'' broadsword and gilded plate poleyn.]]
Priests of Torm wore either clean [[robe]]s complete with a [[breastplate]] and [[bracer]]s or an immaculate set of [[plate mail]] armor with an elaborately decorated helm. Their robes and armor were dyed or tinted with [[ink]] to denote [[Church of Torm#Titles|different ranks]], the latter of which were inscribed with Torm's [[Church of Torm#Penance of Duty|Penance of Duty]].

===Weapons and Arms===
Tormtar kept and used the best weapons and armor available to them. Their weapons were immaculately maintained and their armor polished at all times, save those occasions when doing so would get in the way of their duties.

Followers of Torm treasured a type of [[item enchantment|enchanted]] shield known as the ''[[shield of vigilance]]''. The ''[[lance of Faer√ªn]]'' was a variety of [[lance]] that were crafted specifically for mounted Tormtar champions. The ''[[tooth of Torm]]'' was a type of [[magic]]al dagger with a [[silver]] blade that allowed the wielder to ''[[See invisibility|see through invisibility]]''.

===Spells===
Tormish clergy were granted a casting of the spell ''[[command]]'' to use once per day at their discretion. ''[[golden dragonmail]]'', ''[[Hand of Torm]]'', ''[[bolt of glory]]'', ''[[swordward]]'', and ''[[wrath of Torm]]''.

===Relics===

==Relationships==
[[File:Paladin PHB5e.jpg|left|thumb|A Tormtar paladin on his mount who focused on offense.]]
Several valorous and benevolent knightly orders were considered among the allies of Torm's church, including the [[Knights of Imphras II]], the [[Knights Kuldar of Barakmordin]], and the [[Triadic knight]]s, the latter two of which deified [[the Triad]], the group of gods of which Torm was a member. 

While not allies ''per se'', the Tormish church appreciated the tenets of the [[Guardians of the Weave]], specifically their efforts to negate the ill-effects of [[wild magic]] areas and [[dead-magic zone]]s. They also held the [[church of Gaerdal Ironhand|gnome followers]] of [[Gaerdal Ironhand]] in high regard.

Despite the fact Torm and Helm remained close as divine powers,

The church was considered a direct enemy of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|726}}, the church of Torm, along with those of [[church of Tyr|Tyr]] and [[church of Ilmater|Ilmater]], initiated the [[Triad Crusade]]. Holy warriors from all three faiths were dispatched to Impiltur to depose King [[Argosh]] the Scaled, who had previously seized the kingdom's throne. 

===Time of Troubles===
When the [[Faer√ªnian pantheon|gods of the Realms]] were cast down to [[Toril]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Torm's [[avatar]] manifested within the city of Tantras in [[the Vast]]. designated the followers of other faiths as "unbelievers", and engaged in systematic oppression and torment over them.  

When the colossal [[avatar]] of [[Bane]] marched upon the city that same year, intent on leveling it in search of the lost ''[[Tablet of Fate]]'', Torm took action to protect his followers in his holy city. By means of the [[Ceremony of Power]], Torm absorbed the life force of all his followers‚Äîboth corrupt and true-hearted alike‚Äîand transformed his avatar into that of a [[lion]]-headed, [[humanoid]] champion equal in stature to the Bane's monstrosity. Torm and Bane's avatar's mortally wounded each other in the waters beyond the city, of devout Tormish followers were dead. Many of them sacrificed their lives willingly, so that the great evil could be struck from the Realms.

For his service Torm was reinstated as a member of the Faer√ªnian pantheon. Some speculated that he was offered back his divinity in exchange for carrying the tenets of his faith unto death. Yet others believed that as a formal mortal native to the [[Prime Material plane|Prime]] that ascended to the power of a [[demigod]], Torm could not be destroyed outright on Toril.

===Renaissance===
[[File:Torm statue.JPG|left|thumb|''[[Order of the Radiant Heart]] Torm statue'']]
The church of Torm experienced a rebirth following this miraculous yet tragic series of events. Incensed by his followers' persecution of other goodly religions due to Dunn Tenwealth's misguidance, Torm dictated for his followers' failing the "debts" that became known as the [[Church of Torm#Penance of Duty|Penance of Duty]]. Many children, called the [[Martyr's Progeny]], left orphaned by sacrifices their parents made in Tantras were adopted by the church. 

In the years that followed, Torm's clergy worked alongside [[Church of Mystra|Mystran]] priests to cleanse regions of dead and wild magic that were created during the Avatar Crisis. They utilized some of the [[wish|most potent]] magic available to spellcasters at the time.

After Bane's return in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, many people turned to Torm's church for guidance and protection from the returned evil god and his [[Church of Bane|cultish followers]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, Cyric conspired the death of Tyr and affected Torm alongside the Loyal Fury's church.{{Cite dragon/381/Channel Divinity: Champions of Torm|91}}

===15{{th}} Century===
In the time following the death of Tyr, some of Torm's clergy carried on traditions once associated with the [[Church of Tyr|Tyrran faith]], even utilizing the same titles used within the church. Some orders of Tyrran paladins converted to the veneration of Torm, while others aligned their faiths with other gods.

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Torm's faith had grown exponentially more influential, and boasted the highest number of paladins among any group on all of [[Toril]]. Torm had ascended to the rank of greater power, 

==Members==
All manner of folks from across the Realms embraced Torm's faith and joined his church. These people often sought to better their own lives the world around them, and understood that often required resolute self-sacrifice.

The worship of Torm was notable among the [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s, notably members of the [[Black Lion tribe]].
