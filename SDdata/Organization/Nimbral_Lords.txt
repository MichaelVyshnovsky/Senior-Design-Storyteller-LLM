The '''Nimbral Lords''' were the mysterious [[magic]]al rulers of [[Nimbral]].

==Organization==
These authority figures were very reclusive, and hid themselves away from others. However, they were also said to be insane [[wizard]]s who were controlled by [[illusion]]s.

==Activities==
The Nimbral Lords gave orders to the [[Knights of the Flying Hunt]], who themselves lived in castles on the island. which they might later have further enhanced to become ''[[storm armor]]'' or even ''[[greater storm armor]]''. If the armor was broken, the generous lords would create a new set, and only charge the cost required to create these sets.

As they seldom spoke to others directly, their envoys and ambassadors, the [[Nimbral Heralds]], would often speak for them.

==Members==
Some of the known lords were named [[Ardanthe]], [[Belaurant]], [[Mardamaun]], [[Skouloun]], and [[Yusendre]].{{Cite web/Realmslore/The Realm of Nimbral, Part Eight: The Nimbral Lords}}

==Rumors & Legends==
It was rumored that the Nimbral lords occasionally rode alongside the Knights of the Flying Hunt. Here, the lords would cast a [[spell]] similar to ''[[mass teleport]]'' in order to send their armies across [[Faerun]].
