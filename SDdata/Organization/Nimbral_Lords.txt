The Nimbral Lords were the mysterious magical rulers of Nimbral.
These authority figures were very reclusive, and hid themselves away from others. However, they were also said to be insane wizards who were controlled by illusions.
The Nimbral Lords gave orders to the Knights of the Flying Hunt, who themselves lived in castles on the island. which they might later have further enhanced to become storm armor or even greater storm armor. If the armor was broken, the generous lords would create a new set, and only charge the cost required to create these sets.
As they seldom spoke to others directly, their envoys and ambassadors, the Nimbral Heralds, would often speak for them.
Some of the known lords were named Ardanthe, Belaurant, Mardamaun, Skouloun, and Yusendre.
It was rumored that the Nimbral lords occasionally rode alongside the Knights of the Flying Hunt. Here, the lords would cast a spell similar to mass teleport in order to send their armies across Faerun.
