Valors Call was an adventuring party composed of good-aligned beings, who committed themselves to hunting down and destroying evil wherever it may be.
Valors Call was founded and led by Strongheart, a resolute human paladin. He alone decided who was permitted to join and as such was always keeping an eye out for brave heroes.
