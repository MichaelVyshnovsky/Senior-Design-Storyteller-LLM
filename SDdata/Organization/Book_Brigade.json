        "mainbody": "he Book Brigade was a book club organized by a hin woman named Morgan in the city of Baldurs Gate, active in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the , Morgan ran one of the Book Brigades monthly gatherings to discuss a new pulpy book they had all read since the previous meeting of the club. The group met at Bloomridge Park in the Lower City and consisted of Nansi Gretta, the proprietor of the Bibliophile, half-elf Caerdwyn, and gnome Kepli for whom Nansi Gretta had feelings. At some point during the Absolute crisis of 1492 DR, Nansi Gretta chose to leave the group, owing to the busy schedule running her bookstore, yet Morgan still tried to entice the shopkeep to attend the meetings, using her affections for Kepli as an incentive. One of the works the group read was a series of smutty  books called Dusks Dark Desires, featuring a werecow character, supposedly beautifully written. The book club was in session in Bloomridge Park when a group of assassin worshipers of Bhaal attempted to slaughter the park-goers in the middle of a day to venerate their monstrous deity. It was unknown if the Book Brigadiers survived."
