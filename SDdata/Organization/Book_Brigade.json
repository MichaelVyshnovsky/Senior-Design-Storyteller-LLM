        "mainbody": "The '''Book Brigade''' was a [[book]] club organized by a [[hin]] woman named [[Morgan]] in the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Morgan ran one of the Book Brigade's monthly gatherings to discuss a new pulpy book they had all read since the previous meeting of the club. The group met at [[Bloomridge Park]] in the [[Lower City]] and consisted of [[Nansi Gretta]], the proprietor of [[the Bibliophile]], [[half-elf]] [[Caerdwyn]], and [[gnome]] [[Kepli]] for whom Nansi Gretta had feelings. At some point during the [[Absolute crisis]] of 1492 DR, Nansi Gretta chose to leave the group, owing to the busy schedule running her bookstore, yet Morgan still tried to entice the shopkeep to attend the meetings, using her affections for Kepli as an incentive. One of the works the group read was a series of smutty  books called ''[[Dusk's Dark Desires]]'', featuring a [[werecow]] character, supposedly beautifully written. The book club was in session in Bloomridge Park when a group of [[assassin]] worshipers of [[Bhaal]] attempted to slaughter the park-goers in the middle of a day to venerate their monstrous [[deity]]. It was unknown if the Book Brigadiers survived."
