        "mainbody": "The Seven Eye was an orcish tribe that inhabited the southern reaches of the Fallen Lands in the 14 century DR.\nLike most orc tribes in the Fallen Lands, the members of the Seven Eye tribe occasionally rode upon axebeaks. While doing so, they typically wielded lances or shortbows.\nMore often than not, the members of Seven Eye were seen to engage in warfare with the other orcish tribes that inhabited the southern reaches of the Fallen Lands. However, they showed fealty to the Bloody Scar tribe and their leader King Ogrash, who ruled over the northern reaches of the Fallen Lands."
