The Ahimar clan was the least well known and most secretive of the four major crime families operating in Calimshan in 1370 DR. They rose to power during the Darkstalker Wars in 1359 DR. Believed to have been a lost house, they were aided by Ralan el Pesarkhal, and as such were indebted to him and under his indirect control.
