The '''Ahimar''' clan was the least well known and most secretive of the four major crime families operating in [[Calimshan]] in [[1370 DR]]. They rose to power during the [[Darkstalker Wars]] in [[1359 DR]]. Believed to have been a lost house, they were aided by [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]], and as such were indebted to him and under his indirect control.<ref name=EotSS-p72>
