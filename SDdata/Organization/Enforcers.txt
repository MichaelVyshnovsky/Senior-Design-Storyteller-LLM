The Enforcers were a vigilante law-enforcement company that was active in Realmspace around .
The Enforcers were most commonly found near the outer planets of Realmspace, between Glyth, Garden, and HCatha, but sometimes traveled sunward and could occasionally be found near the Tears of Selûne. Their main purpose was to fight against pirates and mind flayers.
One of the most notable targets of the Enforcers was the pirate Clive the Fearsome from Garden. While unsuccessful in bringing Clive to justice, they were more active around Glyth, where they more successfully hunted down mind flayers. They were careful to stay out of reach of the beholders from HCatha when conducting their operations.
They tended to ignore established law when pursuing their own vision of justice, but were known for occasionally hiring mercenary companies to assist them in their operations.
The company flagship and base of operations was the angelship Enforcer. The reconditioned ship still worked with its original armament, but its aft cargo hold was modified to have its floor removed. This increased the compartments capacity to store large rocks and boulders, up to a maximum capacity of . In addition, since that floor layer was located on the ships gravity plane, its removal had the effect of suspending all the rocks midair.
The ships masts had also been removed to provide a clear field of vision for the rocks to be thrown.
The company was founded by the lizardfolk ranger Frollth, from Coliar. After his friends were captured by mind flayers, never to be seen again, Frollth found the derelict angelship and assembled a crew to restore and crew it.
By the mid‒14 century DR, the leader of the Enforcers was Frollth. The first mate and company bouncer was the frost giant Murray Coldstare, who was proficient with throwing the rocks stored in the Enforcers cargo hold with remarkable accuracy. The company also counted with nine more members, which included mages, clerics, and fighters.
