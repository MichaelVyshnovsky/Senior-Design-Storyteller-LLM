A younger bladesman rode with him, the merry [[Ferostil]]. [[Delg Hammerhand]], a [[dwarf]], was also a [[warrior]]. His constant companion was the [[bard]] [[Rymel]], probably the brightest of them all. The [[wizard]] [[Thail]] deferred to his younger, louder companions. Last and least of the company was the [[thief]], one [[Shandril Shessair]], a bright-eyed, soft-spoken waif in ill-fitting old [[breeches]] and a much-patched [[tunic]].",
