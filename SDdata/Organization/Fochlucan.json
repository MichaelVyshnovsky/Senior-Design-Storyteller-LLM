        "mainbody": "The College of Fochlucan (|audio=Fochlucan.ogg)&mdashalso spelled Foclucan, Focluchan, and Fochluchan&mdashwas a traditional bardic college in Silverymoon.\nThe reestablished college sought to restore the ancient Fochlucan bardic traditions. Most of the bards attending it studied the College of Lore and practiced its methods.\nThe main site of the college lay on the northeastern edge of Silverymoon.\nThe college was allied with the Harpers, but its master bards were always careful to keep their own mission separate from them.\nThe College of Fochlucan was one of the seven elder bardic colleges, dating back to the legendary bard Falataer, who established it as the first level of his bardic college. The Fochlucan bandore, one of the Instruments of the Bards, was named after this college. It had been created by Falataer to test and reward his students who achieved mastery of the Fochlucan level of skill.\nFollowing this tradition, bards studying to obtain the rank of Magna Alumnae attended all seven colleges, starting with Fochlucan before moving on to Mac-Fuirmidh. However, this practice was abandoned once the original colleges declined.\nAfter the original college had closed its doors, it was later reopened as Utrumms Music Conservatory, which was subsequently moved to Southbank. The unoccupied site was then reopened as the House of the Harp by master bard Forell Luekuan, who already envisioned reviving the original colleges traditions and teachings.\nAfter many years, with the support of the city of Silverymoon and the Harpers, the House of the Harp had recruited enough members with sufficient amassed knowledge to revive the original college and adopt the Fochlucan name again."
