House Xlarrazetsoj was a former drow house of Menzoberranzan. It was defeated by House Baenre.
Upon the birth of Gromph Baenre, the matron mother of this house granted him a wand of viscid globs. However, House Baenre themselves destroyed House Xlarrazetsoj just one year later, meaning that Gromph had to say that he found the wand whilst cleaning an attic in House Baenre.
