Yrraska, his second wife, was killed in a tunnel collapse, while his third wife Marral died fighting mind flayers. Nearly all of his remaining children died in these two incidents as well, leaving him with only two living sons as of the .\nXardoroks aspirations for the Sunblight clan were ultimately foiled, and their fortress was taken over by a tribe of kobolds.\n* Xardorok Sunblight, an ambitious warlord.\n* Durth Sunblight, Xardoroks son and lieutenant.\n* Nildar Sunblight, Xardoroks youngest son and lieutenant."
