The '''Yayazato''' clan were a [[samurai]] family in [[Wa]] and the leaders of [[Aru Province]] during the mid-1700s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==History==
After the removal of [[Hisao Matsutomo]] in {{YearlinkConvert|1730|WY}}, the daimyate of Aru Province passed to Takashi Yayazato.

Takashi governed the province well, but suffered much tragedy. Though he had three sons on becoming daimyo, all strong and suitable heirs, two died when their vessel sank in a typhoon and the third was killed in a climbing accident whilst scaling the Dragon's Face of [[Mount Matazan]]. Thus Takashi had no male heirs to succeed him when he died in {{YearlinkConvert|1758|WY}}. Thus, [[shogun]] [[Matasuuri Nagahide]] returned the daimyate to the [[Matsutomo]]s, under [[Benju Matsutomo]].

Takashi's granddaughter, Naomi, later became a favored consort of Benju and was pregnant by him around {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}.

==Notable Members==
* [[Takashi Yayazato]]
* [[Naomi (consort)|Naomi]]
