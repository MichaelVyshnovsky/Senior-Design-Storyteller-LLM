'''House Toporello''' was a respected old mercenary company and noble family of the city-state of [[Sumbria]] in the [[Blade Kingdoms]]. The Toporellos maintained a small army of troops, granting the leader of the House the title of Blade Captain and the privilege to vote in Sumbria's Blade Council.

==Base of Operations==
House Toporello had its own insignia and distinct colors that decorated the soldiers' uniforms and the [[Toporello family palace]]. It was the mansion home and the base of House Toporello, located in the city-state of Sumbria. The sizable mansion was topped with a pepperbox turret, [[copper]] roofing, and shaped like a hollow square, like many other mansions of the Blade Kingdoms. It was defended by [[crossbow]]men atop its battlements and soldiers patrolling the mansion's courtyards with their loyal [[hound]]s. [[Hippogriff]] cavalry and traps could also be seen defending the noble family home. A small army of servants and cleaners always swarmed the halls of the Toporello family palace.

==Possessions==
The Toporello family heirloom was an antique [[horse]] [[bridle]] studded with [[star sapphire]]s. The item was defended by traps  and an army of and mercenaries in 1217 DR, when Sumbria was plagued by a series of burglaries committed by [[Tekorriikii]], a kleptomaniac [[firebird]].

==Relationships==
House Toporello was a fiercely loyal ally and follower of House [[Mannicci]], the ruling family of the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1217}}, House Toporello was burglarized by a greedy firebird who learned that where there were many guards, there were many glorious, glittery, shiny baubles. As [[Orlando Toporello]] slept hugging a wooden box, Tekorriikii found a way into the mansion by clawing through the copper sheet metal roofing and entering the Blade Captain's bedroom. The bird managed to steal the antique horse bridle without Old Toporello waking up.

The summer of the same year, House Toporello accompanied the Prince-elect [[Cappa Mannicci da Sumbria]] into the "white war", a bloodless competition of wits, between Sumbria and [[Colletro]]. The conflict was over the ownership of the lush [[Valley of Umbricci]]. Sumbria won the conflict to the disdain of a Blade Captain of Colletro, [[Ugo Svarézi]].

As per tradition, the "white war" of 1217 DR was followed by the famous resplendent [[Festival of Blades]]. House Toporello participated in the revelries. Orlando Toporello, his anti-thievery committee, and his daughter were present at the [[Palace of Manniccis]] in Sumbria during the famous, scandalous unveiling of ''[[The Sea Goddess Rising from the Weaves]]'' painting gifted to Sumbria by the city-state of [[Lomatra]].

Ugo Svarézi hatched a diabolic plan of betrayal and the use of innovative deadly scientific weapons to disturb the Blade Kingdoms and take power for himself. The Blade Captain manipulated Colletro and Sumbria into an open and bloody war, orchestrating the destruction of the Mannicci's troops and the loss of the ruling family's powers. Three days later, the Blade Council of Sumbria cast their votes to elect a new Prince, leaving loyal Orlando Toporello disgusted with the Council's opportunism. He announced House Toporello's withdrawal from Sumbria and returning to its roots as an independent mercenary company. Three smaller Houses followed the old nobleman's lead and withdrew from the Blade Council.

In the following fall and winter, Ugo Svarézi started a civil war and aimed to take over or destroy the Blade Kingdoms. House Toporello refused the usurper warlord's [[gold]] and [[silver]], saying "this money defiles true solduer's hands."
