The Rangers Three was a nickname for a trio of rangers, consisting of Belkram and Sharantyr of Baldurs Gate and Itharr of Athkatla. They acquired the nickname informally throughout their adventures.
During the Time of Troubles, the Rangers Three assisted Elminster in freeing High Dale from Zhentish occupation.
