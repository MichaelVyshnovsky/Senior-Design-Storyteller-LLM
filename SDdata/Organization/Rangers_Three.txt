The '''Rangers Three''' was a nickname for a trio of [[ranger]]s, consisting of [[Belkram Hardeth|Belkram]] and [[Sharantyr]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] and [[Itharr Jathram|Itharr]] of [[Athkatla]]. They acquired the nickname informally throughout their adventures.<ref><ref>

During the [[Time of Troubles]], the Rangers Three assisted [[Elminster]] in freeing [[High Dale]] from [[Zhentil Keep|Zhentish]] occupation.
