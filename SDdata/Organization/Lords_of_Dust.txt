The Lords of Dust was a secret organization of fiends and mortals in the world of Eberron. It sought to find and release god-like fiends known as the Overlords, which had been imprisoned within Eberrons underworld of Khyber.
The upper echelons of the Lords of Dust were dominated by rakshasas, and the lower ranks were made up of more disposable local humans and other pawns. They were supported by creatures like hezrou, jariliths, hellhounds, death knights, and fire reavers.
