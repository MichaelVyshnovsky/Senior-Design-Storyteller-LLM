        "mainbody": "The Poisoned Quill were a tribe of merfolk in the Sea of Fallen Stars in the 15 century DR.\nThis tribe was particularly known for hunting.\nAll members of this tribe wielded spears that were longer than the average length. They also carried small pouches that contained the spines of pufferfish.\nIn the late-15 century DR, the sea elves of Myth Nantar sent a group of adventurers to try and convince nearby merfolk tribes, including the Poisoned Quill, to aid them in a coming assault from the Red Wizards of Thay. The then leader of the tribe, Asirae, was eager to join the fray and felt her people were prepared for it. Though she was concerned that the other tribes, the Cerulean Shores and Deep Coves, were not as well trained enough for such a battle.\n* Asirae Shipwrecker, the leader of the tribe in the late-15 century DR."
