        "History": "In the late-15{{th}} century DR, the [[sea elves]] of [[Myth Nantar]] sent a group of [[adventurer]]s to try and convince nearby merfolk tribes, including the Poisoned Quill, to aid them in a coming assault from the [[Red Wizards of Thay]]. The then leader of the tribe, Asirae, was eager to join the fray and felt her people were prepared for it. Though she was concerned that the other tribes, the [[Cerulean Shores]] and [[Deep Coves]], were not as well trained enough for such a battle.",
