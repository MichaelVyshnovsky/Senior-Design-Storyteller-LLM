The '''Eltan''' family of [[Baldur's Gate]] was one of the city's noble [[patriar]] families during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were descended from [[Eltan|Duke Eltan]], who once served on the [[Council of Four]]. 

==History==
The family held partial financial ownership of the [[Flaming Fist]] mercenary company. At one point however, they were forced to sell their interest to help pay significant debts they had incurred.

[[Xeremiah Eltan]]'s granddaughter served the city of Baldur's Gate under Counsellor [[Florrick]] and was fiercely loyal to the city and Ulder [[Ulder Ravengard]] during the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.
