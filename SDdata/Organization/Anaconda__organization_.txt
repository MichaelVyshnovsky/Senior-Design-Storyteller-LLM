The '''Anaconda''' were a warrior society and mercenary company hailing from [[Katashaka]] and operating in [[Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were based in the [[Cormanthor|Elven Wood]] near [[Elmwood]].

==Organization==
===Culture===
They were a fellowship of brothers and sisters pledged to protect each other, even to the death.

They had a sophisticated culture, but it was closed to outsiders. They would never share their customs or language, nor their concerns and secrets, with folk outside the group. Their tongue was little known, making for an effective way of communicating in secret without needing a code. They were taciturn on any issue they were asked about.

Their patron [[deity]] was an unnamed snake god.

===Membership===
The Anaconda recruited only married couples, with the two spouses enlisting simultaneously and thereafter fighting as a pair. For their initiation, both members were ritually scarred with two small rows of diamond-shaped scars on their scalps.

In the early 1360s [[DR]], the Anaconda were led by a married couple: [[Nkonzi Maru]], a veteran [[ranger]], and [[Kwanza Maru]], a priest of their snake god.

There were ninety members in all, the majority of them [[warrior]]s proficient in tracking and stealth. It was often rumored they included [[weretiger]]s; the Anaconda never confirmed this, but nor did they deny it. They also had an [[elephant]] mascot named [[Blanka]], while Nkonzi had several [[animal companion]]s, with a [[tiger|white tiger]] and a pair of [[hawk]]s.

==Tactics==
They were very effective as advance scouts and irregular soldiers. They engaged in skirmish tactics by harassing the enemy before withdrawing, or by setting ambushes, most often under cover of night. They used a [[potion]] brewed by Kwanza that granted them [[infravision]] so they could see in darkness. When engaged in large battles or on caravan escort, they employed their elephant as a rallying point.

The warriors traveled and fought light, clad in [[hide armor]] or [[leather armor]]. In melee, they wielded [[scimitar]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[hand axe]]s, they carried [[shield]]s, and at range they used [[blowgun]]s with darts or threw [[javelin]]s.

When outnumbered, the Anaconda would resort to [[poison]], but they had a strict code regulating its use. Poison could only be applied to missile weapons like their blowgun darts, and only be used by one member of each married pair. Poisoned darts were often employed in ambushes.

==Contracts==
The Anaconda would take on any job that paid, with a sliding scale according to the difficulties and danger anticipated. They charged a basic price of 120 [[gold piece]]s per week for their services, rising as high as 400 gold pieces for night-time raids and long-range reconnaissance. They took a calculating attitude toward their jobs.

They never backed out of a contract, instead seeing it through no matter how many lives and couples they lost. However, they suffered and resented every one of their number slain. At the end of a contract, they could turn on a former employer, and wreck everything they'd just protected if their work was not appreciated, or even engaged in a kind of blood feud wit employers who put them in needless danger or wasted their lives.

==Relationships==
The amazon marines that made up a large portion of the [[planes]]-sailing ''[[Ebony Queen]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew were noted to be related to the Anaconda. These warrior women used similar tactics and weaponry.

==History==
How the Anaconda came to be is unknown, even to their leaders. However, it was known they were a black-skinned people originating from an unknown faraway island southwest of Faerûn{{Cite dragon/Speaking in Tongues|29}}<ref group="note">''[[Gold & Glory]]'' refers only to "an island far to the southwest". This could've been the [[Chultan Peninsula]], but that is of course not an island. "Speaking in Tongues" in ''[[Dragon Magazine Annual 1999]]'' uses the Anaconda to suggest a so-called "Dark Continent" where the human [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi tribe]] originated. In later sources, this became Katashaka.

In the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], rumors held that they had taken contracts both defending and raiding caravans in the [[Dalelands]] and fighting alongside and against the [[Stonelands]] [[goblinoid]]s. Some, namely their enemies, said they'd sometimes even worked for the [[Zhentarim]], but the Anaconda typically gave no comment.

In the early 1360s [[DR]] they were operating in the Dalelands and Stonelands.
