        "mainbody": "The '''Fenlis''' were a tribe of [[goblin]]s in the [[Goblin Marches]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "The Fenlis competed with the [[Neidlig]] for power in the region, attempting to assemble their own dominion of goblins. They were spurred into this grand goal by the proclamations of Neidlig's King [[Srubaash]], who intended to build his own realm of goblins, [[orc]]s, [[ogre]]s, [[kobold]]s, and more in the style of [[Hlundadim]].",
        "Base of Operations": "The lair of the Fenlis was hidden north of the [[High Moors]], and extremely well defended by traps of unsurpassed technical complexity.",
        "Relationships": "The Fenlis were xenophobic elitists, and believed that goblins should subjugate or exterminate all others. They were unusual in the region for only having goblins in their tribe, refusing to hire or integrate orcs and ogres, and despised the Neidlig for trying to build a multi-racial empire. They raided and warred with every non-goblin around them, and particularly hated the [[Colchar]] [[orc]]s."
