Unbeknownst to the sheikh, he was being manipulated by the spellcaster Yhekal and forced to act against his will.

The tribe was all but eradicated by the invading forces, and their bodies were fed to the reptilian asabis.\n* AlAif, the tribes most fearsome warrior.\n* Nata, its most mighty tribesman.\n* Ruha, the exiled spellcaster who guided her people away from subjugation."
