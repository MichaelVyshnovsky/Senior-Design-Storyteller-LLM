House TanorThal was the dominant house in the drow city of Karsoluthiyl in the 14 century DR.
The house sold a large number of slaves in Skullport. Using a portal to their outpost of Kyorlamshin, led by Matron Haelra TanorThals niece Kesra, they captured any potential slaves that they could and sold them in the bazaars of Skullport. House TanorThal was, in fact, Skullports most prominent drow slaving organization.
Political pressure was being put on Matron TanorThal back in Karsoluthiyl to allow access to Kyorlamshins portal for the other houses of the city. This was a concession the matron mother did not wish to make.
House TanorThal also established itself in Spiderhaven, where a lot of displaced drow had recently begun to dwell as of 1375 DR.
