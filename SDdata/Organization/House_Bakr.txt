House Bakr, also called the Clan of the Young Camel, was an enlightened desert tribe of Al-Badia spread across west Zakhara in 1367 DR.
In 1367 DR, most of the tribe abandoned their desert life in favor of living in and around the city of Tajar where their sheikh ruled. Still, some 500 of them preferred to stay true to their ancient ways and remained within the High Desert.
Many members of House Bakr married into other desert tribes.
Sheikh Ali al-Hadd was the leader of the House of Bakr, as well as the city of Tajar, in 1367 DR. Ajan al-Yaqud led the portion of the tribe living within the High Desert.
