        "Possessions": "As poetically suggested by the fourth stanze of the ''Moonlight Paean'', the orcs of the Nethertide Horde possessed magical [[talisman of spell reflection|''talismans of spell reflection'']], which allowed the orcs to deflect some of the spells cast upon them back at their foes. (Several decades later, [[witch doctor]]s and [[shaman]]s of the [[Thousand Fists]] orc tribe of the Nether Mountains still knew the secret of crafting such [[talisman]]s, as did the [[cambion]] [[Kaanyr Vhok]], who sought to teach the craft to other orc tribes in the region.)",
