"'''Kraken hunters'''" were mercenaries available for hire at the harbor of [[Westgate]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] who promised to protect ships from [[kraken]] attacks.

==History==
Following the rise of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] during the 15{{th}} century DR, anxiety arose that their kraken minions would attack ships. In Westgate, this led to the rise of self-proclaimed "kraken hunter" agencies, which branded themselves with fearsome names and provided [[spear]]-wielding mercenaries who promised to protect merchants' cargo and to secure shipping lanes.

By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, it was well-known among the kraken hunters themselves that a kraken attack was exceedingly unlikely, and so most of them simply expected to collect their pay without risk.{{Cite organized play/LFR/A Stab in the Dark|8}}

==Notable Kraken Hunters==
* [[Aboleth Slayers]], a kraken hunter agency
* [[Sashara Keenspear]], who was famous as the most legitimately dangerous of the kraken hunters
* [[Yu Kai]], a famous hunter, and [[Yu Kai's Kraken Exterminators]], a kraken hunter agency
