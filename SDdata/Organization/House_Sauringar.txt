'''House Sauringar''' was one of the greater tribes ([[Yuan-ti dictionary#H|''ha'srammass'']]) of the [[yuan-ti]].

==Base of Operations==
House Sauringar maintained a large holding in the [[Chultengar]] They also had members living in northern [[Chult]], northern [[Calimshan]], and [[Narubel]].

==Activities==
Secretly, the Sauringans were the true rulers of the city-state of Narubel. They also had a strong influence over the actions of the [[Rundeen]]. For centuries they supported the Rundeen with targeted acts of piracy.

==Customs==
Members of House Sauringar employed the "[[to the egg return]]" ritual, sharing the practice with the [[House Extaminos|Extaminos]] and [[House Se'Sehen|Se'Sehen]] tribes.

Magical ''[[serpent ring]]s'' were favored by members of House Sauringar.

==Relationships==
House Sauringar was closely allied with House Se'Sehen, which was a far more powerful tribe. The Sauringans benefited the latter house by secretly influencing the Rundeen, guiding the merchant consortium against selecting [[Tashalan]] leaders with ophiophobia. These actions eventually led to House Se'Sehen allying itself with the Rundeen.

Also allied with the Sauringar tribe were the [[spirit naga]]s of the Chultengar.

==History==
For hundreds of years, the [[Sanrach Basin]] was the home of the Sauringans.

The Sauringar tribe was finally driven from their ancient lands in [[605 DR]] by [[human]]s led by a lord of [[Nimbral]].

==Members==
Most Sauringans with snake bodies possessed the ability to puff out their skin, increasing the size of their bodies to appear more threatening, similar to [[wikipedia:Bitis|puff adders]]. Sauringans living in Chult and Calimshan were served by human cultists who worshiped [[Varae]].

===Notable Members===
* [[Di'Nastassa]], the [[yuan-ti pureblood|pureblood]] chosen one of a [[jahi]], led a cabal of Sauringans in the depths of the jungles of [[Samarach]]. This [[Harim of the Jahi]] sought to reclaim the [[Chultan Peninsula]] for the yuan-ti.
* [[Sa'Sani]], a princess of House Sauringar and priestess of [[Sseth]], held a public position as the head of a merchant company in Samarach's capital [[Samargol]]. She was expelled from the city in [[1374 DR]] over the exposure of one of her employees as a yuan-ti. Aided by an adventurer party in her employ, she moved her base of operations to [[Crossroad Keep]] in the [[Sword Coast North]] and prosecuted a counterinsurgency against [[Zehir]]'s [[Snaketongue cult]], which had come to control House Se'Sehen.
