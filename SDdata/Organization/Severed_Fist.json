While doing so, they typically wielded lances or shortbows.\nMore often than not, the Severed Fist were seen to be engaging in warfare with the other orcish tribes that inhabited the southern reaches of the Fallen Lands. However, they showed fealty to the Bloody Scar tribe and their leader King Ogrash, who ruled over the northern reaches of the Fallen Lands."
