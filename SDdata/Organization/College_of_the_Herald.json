        "mainbody": "he College of the Herald was a bardic college from Heralds Holdfast that instructed the bard members of the Heralds of Faer√ªn.\nThe main focus of the Heralds was to collect and preserve knowledge of ancient history, legends, heraldry, and folklore, and to make it available for those of good and peaceful intentions. For that reason, most Herald bards studied the College of Lore and practiced its methods. There was little focus on musical performance, but the library had a vast collection of songs.\nThe colleges main site was Heralds Holdfast, northwest of Silverymoon.\nThe Heralds were allies of the Harpers, but chose to remain neutral in most conflicts in order to keep preserving knowledge as their top priority.\nThe college was founded at the same time the Heralds themselves were formed in 922 DR by the Harper Aliost Oskrunnar.This date is in disagreement with the founding of the Heralds from The Grand History of the Realms, p. 113, which states it to be 992 DR. It is possible that this is a typo in the Sword Coast Adventurers Guide."
