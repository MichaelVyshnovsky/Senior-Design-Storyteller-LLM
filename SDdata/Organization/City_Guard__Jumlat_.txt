The '''City Guard''' of the [[Jumlat]] served as a police force within the city as well as a standing army for the "City of Multitudes".

==Organization==
The composition of the city guard as of {{Yearlink|1367}}{{AQ-time}} was 10,000 infantry, 1,000 mercenary cavalry, and a navy of 30 ships.

==Activities==
All members of the cavalry were skilled [[desert rider]]s from the [[High Desert]]. The navy patrolled the [[Pearl Banks]] to protect Jumlat's investment in the area. Jumlat also hired 10â€“30 additional ships crewed by [[Corsair (kit)|corsairs]] and privateers to harass their rival [[Gana]].
