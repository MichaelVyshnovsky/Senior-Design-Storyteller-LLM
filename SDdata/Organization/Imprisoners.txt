The '''Imprisoners''' were a group of powerful mages active in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Working for [[Larloch]], they imprisoned spirits in [[magic item]]s. Their ultimate goal was apparently to preserve some of Larloch's power so he could access it later. The items created were known as [[Blueflame ghost|Blueflame items]] and had powerful magic contained within.

The [[church of Mystra]] became aware of the plot but [[Mystra]] herself apparently refused to allow any interference. The [[Simbul]] believed the Blueflame items created by the Imprisoners contained enough of Mystra's power to restore the goddess after her death in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}.
