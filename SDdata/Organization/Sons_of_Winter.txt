The '''Sons of Winter''' was a [[primordial]] cult dedicated to [[Cirotralech]] that operated out of the [[Fimbrul]] in [[Laerakond]].

==History==
In [[1480 DR]], the Sons of Winter were founded by the scholar [[Rathloff]],{{Cite organized play/LFR/Quench the Fire of the Raging God|34-36}} in order to awaken the primordial Cirotralech.

To fulfill their goals, Rathloff and his followers raided the ruins of [[Darkturret]] in [[Gontal]], searching for powerful [[magic item]]s.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stir Not the World's Doom|15}} This alerted Queen [[Imreera Hethkantan]] of their existence, and the Queen quickly assembled a group of [[adventurer]]s to deal with the cultists.

The adventurers faced the Sons in Fimbrul, where they were conducting foul rituals to unleash Cirotralech, having previously released the [[Bride]], Cirotralech's consort.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Stir Not the World's Doom|15}} The adventurers were able to stop the ritual and kill all the Sons, but is uncertain whether or not they could stop them unleashing Cirotralech.
