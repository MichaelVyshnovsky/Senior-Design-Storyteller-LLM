        "mainbody": "The '''Church of Lathander''' was an organization that comprised the collective practitioners of the faith surrounding [[Lathander]] the Morninglord. It was among the most well-respected, Lathander's church languished for decades following the Morninglord's apparent \"death\", and true to his divine domain of rebirth, was restored following the conclusion of the [[Era of Upheaval]].",
        "Organization": {
            "Titles": "Titles within the church included (in descending order): Sunrise Lord, High Mornmaster, Mornmaster, High Morninglord, Morninglord, Dawnmaster, High Dawnlord, Dawnlord, Dawngreeter, Dawnbringer, and Awakened for novitiates. Despite the numerous titles, Lathanderian clergy commonly referred to one another as \"Dawnbringer\" or \"Dawn Priest\". \n\nIn old [[Athalantar]], clergy members were referred to as \"Lights of Lathander\".{{Cite dragon/228/The Athalantan Campaign|32}}\n\nIt was customary for priests to take on a new name for themselves, as revealed to them by Lathander. This act symbolized their \"rebirth\" as an official member of the clergy.",
            "Factions": "{{Quote|The [[Netherese]] of old knew [[Amaunator]], the great sun lord, whose light and order filled the world for an age. We know him now as Lathander...Just as the sun brightens while it climbs into the sky, so will Lathander's glory and radiance grow as he resumes the glory and mastery that were his of old.|[[Sunmaster]] [[Andar]], espousing beliefs of the [[Risen Sun heresy|Risen Sun]].}}\n\nWithin the greater church was a faction that believed Lathander was in fact the reincarnation of the [[Netherese pantheon|Netherese god]] [[Amaunator]]. This divine theory led to the rise of the [[Risen Sun heresy]], the belief that Lathander would transform into a resurrected Amaunator within a matter of years.\n\nYet others subscribed to the [[Three-Faced Sun heresy]], that the [[sun]] itself was trisected [[overdeity]]—that comprised the three aspects of dawn, highsun, and dusk—only two of which could be witnessed by mortals at any given time. To these individuals, Lathander supplanted Amaunator as the aspect of dawn and became dominant over highsun and dusk. Opinions differed on whether Lathander or another deity would ascend as the aspect of highsun, and what would become of the aspect of dawn."

They cultivated lands that were otherwise barren, culled monstrous creatures to make way for new settlements, fought off the forces of [[evil]], and imparted civilized ideals to discordant locales. Lathanderians offered much assistance to adventurers, pilgrims, or others that traveled across the Realms. They made efforts to recover long-lost [[relic]]s, [[magic items]], or creative works such as literature or art in order to further their own innovative endeavors.\n\nPriests offered a wide variety of services to their parishioners, including marriages, birthings, funerary services,  and even public announcements of new public works projects.\n\nLathanderian temples often sponsored non-combative athletic events, such as wrestling, archery, riding, running, swimming, and the like. They also honored creative competition in the arts, including the arts such as literature. More often, local clergy hosted grand revels for forward-thinking scholars and intellectuals, in order to stimulate their creativity and inspire new ideas that would further advance culture and civilization across [[Faerûn]].\n\nPriests of Lathander often concerned themselves with new business ventures, offering loans to business people seeking more startup capital than their neighborhood moneylender could offer. Some of them took this entrepreneurial spirit even further, becoming investors, merchants, and financial brokers for their own personal enrichment. They were often viewed as overly enthusiastic hucksters. Yet other priests chose to propagate more humanistic unions, serving as matchmakers to prospective lovers that had yet to find their partners.",
        "Rituals": "Befitting Lathander's title of Morninglord, rituals, ceremonies, and daily prayers led by his clergy were held at dawn each day. Formal unions such as official contracts or marriages held during that time were considered especially blessed. An additional prayer to Lathander was held by some temples at highsun each day, and were considered a solemn but joyous rite of the faith. A ceremony known as the Going Down was performed at funerals, which were always held at dusk.\n\nLathander's faithful often invoked Lathander's blessing before setting out on long travels or embarking upon new ventures.",
        "Celebrations": "The [[Song of the Morning]], or ''Song of Dawn'', was sung in Lathanderian temples on certain days throughout the [[Calendar of Harptos|year]], notably on the mornings of [[Midsummer]] and the [[vernal equinox|vernal]] and [[autumnal equinox]]es. The elegant song honored Lathander with an intricate combination of choral harmonies.\n\nThe holiday of [[Rhyestertide]] celebrated in [[Waterdeep]] was held in honor of Rhyester, Lathander's first prophet.\n\nAnother Waterdhavian festival called [[Sornyn]] was observed by both the Lathanderian and [[Church of Waukeen|Waukeenar]] clergies of the city. It was a blessed occasion to forge new business agreements, formalize pacts and contracts, build relations with foreign entities, and interestingly enough, overindulge in [[wine]] and other drink.\n\nIn [[Mulmaster]], Lathanderians celebrated the [[Festival of Fiery Night]], a night-long revel that was to many little more than an excuse to get exceedingly drunk.{{Cite adventurers league/Mayhem in the Earthspur Mines|21}}",

They were nearly always built with the temple's main chamber facing east, in the direction of the rising [[sun]].\n\nIn exchange for these services, the temples' clergy accepted tithings of food, [[gp|gold]], magic items, or even newly-formed ideas or inventions from Lathander's faithful.

They believed themselves divinely appointed to carry out Lathander's will and administer to the lives of their \"lessers\". Other Lathanderian clergy maintained strong moral character, and their genuine compassion was appreciated by Faerûnians from all walks of life.\n\nWhile they did not require others to praise Lathander to benefit from their altruism, Lathanderians highly encouraged his worship among the more [[good]]ly folks of the Realms.

        "History": {
            "14{{th}} Century": "Lathander's Wandering Patriarch [[Ansultath]] received a prophetic dream regarding the [[Time of Troubles]] some time during or before the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. According to him, great turmoil would inspire new heroes to arise and usher in a [[Era of Upheaval|new era]] for the Realms.\n\nAfter [[Waukeen]]'s disappearance from the [[Faerûnian pantheon|pantheon]], and the subsequent pronouncement of her death in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, some of her faithful converted to the worship of Lathander.\n\nDespite the popularity of the Lathanderian faith at the time, the church itself was faced with a ever-growing divide. [[Daelegoth Orndeir]] of [[Elversult]] began giving sermons that declared Lathander was actually the restored god Amaunator, who would soon reveal his true nature. Belief in the Risen Sun began to grow increasingly popular and Amaunatori [[sunlords]] were regularly offered support by the church. By [[Ches]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the influential [[Tower of Morning]] in Telpir proclaimed support for the new Risen Sun belief offering it credence by one of the Morninglord's most grand temples. Within months belief of the Risen Sun had spread as far away as Sembia and clergy of [[Saerb]] that did not subscribe to the Risen Sun were exiled from their community.\n\nAfter Daelegoth performed a ''[[miracle]]'' to spare his city from the disastrous effects of the melting of the [[High Ice]], his brand of Lathanderism spread far and wide along the [[Trade Way]]. A conclave of Cormyrean priests from Marsember declared Daelegoth a heretic, while conversely the head of the Sun Soul monks offered their him their full support. On [[Midsummer]] that year, the Risen Sun prophet cast an ''[[Amaunator's eternal sun|epic spell]]'' that created a second sun that remained above the city of Elversult. While the church of Lathander remained divided, the [[church of Amaunator]] was reborn.\n\nWhen the calamitous [[Spellplague]] struck the Realms in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, it was believed by some scholars that Lathander had died, while others insisted that he was actually the reincarnation of Amaunator.{{Cite dragon/388/Channel Divinity: Tymora|45}} Yet another group theorized that Lathander was an [[aspect]] of Amaunator, a divine persona used to conceal his true nature during his centuries of absence.{{Cite dragon/378/Domains in Eberron and the Forgotten Realms|37}}",
            "15{{th}} Century": "During the time of the [[Second Sundering]], in the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, the child Chosen of Lathander [[Stedd Whitehorn]] arrived in [[Turmish]] and performed powerful magic while the [[druid]]s of the [[Emerald Enclave]] recited the ''[[Hymn of Still Waters]]'' to end the realms' devastating drought.
