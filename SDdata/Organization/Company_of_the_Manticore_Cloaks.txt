The '''Company of the Manticore Cloaks''' was a renowned and chartered adventuring company of [[Cormyr]], active in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, the Company of the [[Manticore]] [[Cloak]]s was a famous group of heroes in service of the Crown of Cormyr. Even mention of their name caused whispers and excited murmurs. The company was mentioned by King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] when then-unknown [[adventurer]]s – [[Knights of Myth Drannor|Swords of Eveningstar]], were granted Cormyr's official adventuring charter. King Azoun held a grand ceremony in the town of [[Espar]] and competed the young adventurers to still famed Company of the Manticore Cloaks, predicting the Swords' bright future.
