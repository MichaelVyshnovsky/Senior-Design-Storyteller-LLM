        "Activities": "Despite the requirements for all citizens to serve, active deployments in the militia were rather sparse. They served as guards for a minimum of three days of each month.\n\nSoldiers were required to carry out guard duty or patrol the lands beyond the town's walls.\n\nThe constable of Daggerford was selected from among the ranks of the militia.",
        "Possessions": {
            "Training": "Each recruit was trained in horsemanship and taught how to wield a spear in combat. While only one day of training was required each month, some militiamen attended more often in order to further hone their skills. \n\nThe duke's master–at–arms offered additional martial training to those who had access to other [[weapons]], or individuals of noble birth."
        },
        "Base of Operations": "The militia was headquartered in the town's barracks and were given space to train in the nearby drill field, just south of the town's [[Caravan Quarter]].",
        "Relationships": "In the years following the [[Second Dragonspear War]], the militia fought alongside the 3{{rd}} company of [[Waterdeep|Waterdeep's]] [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|High Guard]].",
        "History": "When the [[fiend]]ish [[Hordes of Dragonspear (army)|hordes of Dragonspear]] threatened the [[Sword Coast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, the militia fought alongside their allies from [[Waterdeep]], along with [[dwarven]] and [[elven]] allies. They valiantly defended their home during the [[Battle of Daggerford]].\n\nAfter the second [[Dragonspear War]], the [[Council of Guilds]] created a barracks that housed both the town's militia and the 3{{rd}} company of Waterdeep's [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|High Guard]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the Daggerford militia committed all 50 of its soldiers to the [[Coalition]] army that set out to stop the threat of the [[Shining Crusade]]. They fought under the leadership of [[Haither Stonehand|General Haither Stonehand]].{{Cite web/Siege of Dragonspear: Field Report|9}}\n\nSometime around the {{YearlinkName|1485}} the retired [[Purple Dragon knight]] [[Isteval|Sir Isteval]] let a group of militiamen to [[Cromm's Hold]] after the keep was assaulted by the [[black dragon]] [[Sjachmalsvir]].\n\nA short time later the region around Daggerford was assailed by monstrous creatures, including [[gnoll]]s and [[goblin]]s. Under order of [[Maldwyn Daggerford|Duke Maldwyn]], the militia was forced to close the town's gates and bar entry to the scores of refugees that fled the surrounding farmlands.",
