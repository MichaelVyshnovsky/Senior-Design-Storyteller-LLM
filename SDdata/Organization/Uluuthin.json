        "History": "During the politically tumultuous past of the Turmish nation, House Uluuthin was among the noble merchant clans contending for the Princedom. House Uluuthin lost three of its scions in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] after the family purchased a magical tome excavated from a tomb complex underneath the city of [[Jathrin's Jump]]. The tombs were used as a temple of [[Talos]], with an [[undead]] High Priest [[Aragath Taltar]] helming the worship. The [[book]] was Aragath's diary, and after getting the tome, Uluuthin house members spread word of Aragath's undead state sometime ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1310}}. Mysteriously, three young lords of House Uluuthin perished while adventuring and Aragath felt cheated, unable to slay them himself."
