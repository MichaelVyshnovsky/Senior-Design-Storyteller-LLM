House Norjah was a noble house in the city of Airspur whose mansion was located in Airspurs south-facing cliffs. The house was most notable for being almost entirely composed of vampires.
House Norjah managed to acquire seven of the twenty-two Whispering Children artifacts. In 1479 DR, the genasi Riltana stole one of the Whispering Children and Lord Kasdrian sent vampiric assassins after her although they eventually reached a truce.
*Kasdrian - Leader of the house
*Lady Ascension - Member of the Rune Court
