        "mainbody": "The Seekers of Scales was a dragon cult that operated out of Tarmalune, one of the Windrise Ports. It was the oldest, largest, and wealthiest of the dragon cults of Laerakond.\nThe cult was composed mostly by dragonborn and humans, although a few individuals of other races were members as well. They were barely tolerated in Tarmalune, only allowed to exist because the citizens believed in freedom of choice. The Seekers met in secret in a high tower on the edge of Tarmalune.\nMany people also suspected that most of the rulers of Sambral were part of the Seekers.\nMost people in Tarmalune believed the Seekers wanted to attune themselves and commune with dragons, usually a random wyrm nearby, though they could also select an individual dragon if they were aware of its proximity. To be able to achieve this mental state, the Seekers used drugs and herbs usually sold for other purposes. Some cultists believed that if they were able to attune with a dragon, they would learn their secrets, or at least the location of their hoards.\nHowever, the true goal of the Seekers was to uncover the secrets that allowed a humanoid to transform into a dragon. The Seekers believed that such a transformation was a way to achieve godhood, as they believed dragons were akin to the gods themselves. They called this state of being \"the Dreaming\"."
