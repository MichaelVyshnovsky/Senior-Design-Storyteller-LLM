        "mainbody": "he Keepers of the Flame were a monastic order of psionic duergar clerics of Laduguer who dwelled in the city of Gracklstugh in the Northdark.\nThey had the duty of serving the Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh, the red dragon Themberchaud,\nThey kept Themberchaud under control through their persuasions, psionics, and appeasements, and by speaking on his behalf with others. But they also secretly had the responsibility of slaying the Wyrmsmith before he grew too strong, and of replacing him with a new and more pliable hatchling.\nBy the late 15 century, the Keepers had much influence in the city and advised Deepking Horgar Steelshadow V and aided him in thwarting the plots of the derro Council of Savants. They advised the D The Keepers power rested on their psionics, the Deepkings authority, and their control of Themberchaud.\nThe Keepers were caught up in a bitter feud with the Gray Ghosts thieves guild, also based in Gracklstugh. Otherwise, they were highly respected within the city.\nAt some point, the Gray Ghosts under Zunkhasp Saltbaron stole a red dragon egg from Themberchauds hoardâ€”it was unclear whether it was his offspring or a prize of conquest. In a rage, the Keepers declared war on the Gray Ghosts, opening hostilities between them and causing strife in the city by 1373 DR.\nHowever, in the late 1400s DR, the Gray Ghosts once again stole a red dragon egg,It is unclear if the two egg theft incidents are meant to be the same or unrelated, and if it is the same egg. Out of the Abyss says this is \"recently\" but is set more than a century later, so it is presumed they are separate events. this one intended to hatch a new Wyrmsmith, and the Keepers became distracted by their renewed war on the thieves. The Keepers captured and executed the Gray Ghost leader, but he never gave up the eggs hiding place and they were shamed by their failure. Worse still, Themberchaud, still the current Wyrmsmith, had grown stronger, restless, and more resistant to their control, and had started getting ideas of dominating the whole city for himself. In response, the Keepers refocused their security around the dragons lair and explored other options. They hired talented mercenaries within the city, but Themberchaud too would try to recruit them as his agents, while Gartokkar would then interrogate them as to the dragons intentions.\nAlthough the Keepers also sensed the effects of a demon incursion into the Underdark at the time, but not the demons themselves, Gartokkar was convinced the Gray Ghosts were somehow behind it. He would hire a group of adventurers to follow a derro Gray Ghost agent, Droki, to locate their lair. The Keepers might also have fought an open battle with the Gray Ghosts at this time.\nThe Keepers trained as both psionicists and priests, or in other terms, psions and clerics. Their psionics gave them powers similar to the friends, message, and command spells, in addition to their divine spells.\nThe Keepers of the Flame wore crimson robes.\n* Gartokkar Xundorn, leader of the Keepers in the late 1400s DR"
