        "mainbody": "wivelback was a goblin tribe active sometime before the late 13 century DR in Faerûn.\nSwivelback goblins were led by a somewhat legendary leader – Chief Geraq, who rose to power, by some accords, thanks to his talent for strategy or, according to other legends, for being able to feed his tribe on the raid spoils for weeks, while others attributed his leadership to knowledge of obscure and helpful lore. However, in truth, Geraq led his tribe with the aid of a special type of Ioun stone – scarlet-blue ioun stone, which the goblin never parted with. Eventually, Chief Geraq disappeared from the pages of history books, but the magic stone continued whispering the goblins knowledge to anyone who owned it."
