[[Shadow Thieves]] in the employ of Geldirth II raided the Gundwynd villa, capturing or killing every Gundwynd they could find, then absconded with the wealth in the villa's vaults. The surviving, captured Gundwynds were then trapped and starved to death in the [[Fireplace Level]], where they rose as [[ghost]]s intent on killing Geldirth II or his descendants.{{Cite dungeon/128/Vampires of Waterdeep: The Fireplace Level|74}}\n\nA distant relative of the deceased Gundwynds came to Waterdeep and claimed the family's noble title, rebuilding their wealth on the back of the slave trade. Though they couldn't prove the [[Gost]]s involvement, the Gundwynd family would harbor suspicions that the Gosts were responsible for the attack for centuries thereafter.\n\nIt appears that the Gundwynds had successfully abandoned the slave trade by mid-fourteenth century, as they had returned to their old aerial mounts business.\n\nAround [[1367 DR]], with the family business struggling, [[Maurgosz Gundwynd]] attempted unsuccessfully to convince the Lords of Waterdeep that hippogriffs should be accepted as steeds in the Griffon Cavalry due to their more temperate nature.\n\nSome time between the {{YearlinkName|1367}} and the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the heir of the family, [[Jynnia Gundwynd|Jynnia]], disappeared and her younger brother, Myrnd became the heir in her place.<ref>{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|4,8}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1388}} the Gundwynd Clan was once again rendered extinct in [[Waterdeep]] after entering the burial portal in their family tomb in the [[City of the Dead (Waterdeep)|City of the Dead]] to bury three members, shortly after the [[Spellplague]] first struck the city. All who emerged were permanently transformed into [[troll]]s or [[giant]]s.",
