Toknana led Hruba the Chimera, Ylarria the red dragon, Voal the hydra, and numerous leucrotta petitioners, who were allowed to join the pack as a reward for being dangerous and resourceful during their lives.\nThe Pack did not fear anything and hunted and attempted to kill anything they encountered.\nLeucrotta worshiped the Pack as gods and strived to join their host in the afterlife. As a reward, The Pack sent prey to deserving mortal followers or their members to protect leucrotta that needed defending or in an effort to teach them new tricks in deceit."
