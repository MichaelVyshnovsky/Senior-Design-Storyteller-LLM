The Wrath of the Old was a holy slayer organization in Zakhara who followed the teachings of Kor, the Zakharan god of wisdom.
The symbol of the Wrath of the Old was a dagger emblazoned with the sunburst of Kor.
Agents from this group of holy slayers were devoted to eliminating anyone who hindered the learning or the spreading of knowledge. They tended to be a reclusive group but spared no expense when doing the work of their god.
Agents could be found in all of the Free Cities, as well as in the Corsair Domains and Huzuz.
The Furrowed Mountains south of the Free Cities was the base of the Wrath of the Old.
