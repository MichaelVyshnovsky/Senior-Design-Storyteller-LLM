The '''Wrath of the Old''' was a [[holy slayer]] organization in [[Zakhara]] who followed the teachings of [[Kor]], the Zakharan god of wisdom.{{cite book/Land of Fate/Fortunes and Fates|27}}

The symbol of the Wrath of the Old was a dagger emblazoned with the sunburst of Kor.

==Activities==
Agents from this group of holy slayers were devoted to eliminating anyone who hindered the learning or the spreading of knowledge. They tended to be a reclusive group but spared no expense when doing the work of their god.

Agents could be found in all of the [[Free Cities of Zakhara|Free Cities]], as well as in the [[Corsair Domains]] and [[Huzuz]].

==Base of Operations==
The [[Furrowed Mountains]] south of the Free Cities was the base of the Wrath of the Old.
