        "mainbody": "The '''wakadoshiyori''' were an office of the shogunate of [[Wa]]. They were the fourth most important office in the hierarchy of the shogunate.",
        "Organization": "The wakadoshiyori were considered subordinates of the Council of Elders, called the [[roju]]. Between two and four officials served in this role.\n\nLike all other positions in the shogunate, to be a junior elder was a coveted role, and only the shogun could approve such an appointment.",
        "Activities": "These junior elders had similar duties to members of the roju but particularly oversaw the [[daimyo]]'s [[hatamono]], or \"bannermen\". They also performed a miscellany of other activities, such as inspecting public buildings or supervising the appointment of staff and counselors to the daimyo."
