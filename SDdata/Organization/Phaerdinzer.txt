The Phaerdinzer clan was a family of magically powerful individuals extant in the late 14 century DR.
The Phaerdinzers were sharp-featured, with unusual eye colors such as emerald, ice-blue, and gray, and hair most often auburn, red, or brown.
The clan had been fostered by Maxiladanarr Torstren during his reign as the Magister, from  to . He determined that some archmage had experimented on them "until their veins ran with magic". As this was not a normal occurrence, he considered there was something special about their experimentation or about their makeup.
More immediately before his fostering, they had been shopkeepers, mostly in the furniture and medicine business, for a long time. Their members had practiced magic, but took care to hide the true extent of their powers.
As of , the clan was led by Othlo Phaerdinzer and Jasurra Phaerdinzer, who remained in their Tallstones mansion in Athkatla, Amn. Their most likely successor was Dartabba Shoukyn.
The clan counted about six hundred people, of which two hundred may have been mages of some accomplishment, as most never developed their power beyond a handful of spells.
The Phaerdinzers were never in any risk of their body failing while midway through a transformation. They also had the ability to use a number of minor magics at will, such as a form of silence that affected only them, a short-range form of telekinesis out to , and the ability to levitate themselves or feather fall. About half of them also had one more power, like dancing lights, invisibility, detect thoughts, detect invisibility, locate object, spider climb, or sleep.
Most people saw the Phaerdinzers as ambitious merchants who just loved their work.
Phaerdinzers never admitted to any power, making excuses for it by blaming it on sorcerous wares, for instance. They thought their powers were probably a prank from the gods, maybe one that theyd be let in on some day a few generations hence.
