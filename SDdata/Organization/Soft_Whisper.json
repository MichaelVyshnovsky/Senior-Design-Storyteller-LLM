It was unknown whether or not the Grand Caliph gave commands to the Soft Whisper, but those who spoke out against him met swift ends at the hands of these skilled assassins.\nWithin Huzuz it was rumored that the Grand Vizier merely had to go pray at the Mosque of Hakiyah the Honest if she discovered a threat to the Grand Caliphs life and wished to have it eliminated.\nThe Soft Whisper was the only holy slayer organization where all of the members were female.\nHoly slayers of the Soft Whisper were active throughout the Land of Fate, but Golden Huzuz was the seat of their power.\nSeveral members of the Soft Whisper held positions of power with the royal harim of the Palace of the Enlightened Throne.\nThe basement of the Mosque of Hakiyah the Honest housed several members of the Soft Whisper."
