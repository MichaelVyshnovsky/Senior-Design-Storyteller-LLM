        "mainbody": "The Jewelers Guild was one of the official guilds of Waterdeep. It was responsible for the acquisition and distribution of gems throughout the city, as well as the cutting, mounting, and appraisal of gemstones.\nThe Jewelers Guild was small, secretive, and extremely wealthy. Its members were known to be always accompanied by large contingents of bodyguards, usually up to the maximum limit of sixteen guards per non-noble person.\nGuild members wore deep purple robes with a triangular crown-cut white gem placed on the chest, with the point downward. They also wore purple hats adorned with white feathers.\nAll work of cutting, polishing, and mounting gems was handled by members of the Jewelers Guild. They also performed repairs and resetting of gems upon request, as well as appraisal of gemstones at the behest of other merchants.\nThe guild also took it upon itself to police illegal gem traffic and gem theft within the city. They relentlessly pursued suspected perpetrators and enacted quiet vendettas upon them.\nThe guild typically handled the acquisition of gems by privately hiring mercenaries and adventuring parties to bring hauls of uncut precious gems from distant locations. The most common expeditions were hired to steal such gems from the South.\nIt was common for guild members to hire dwarven artisans and mages to create traps to protect their gems and gold.\nThe guilds headquarters was the House of Gems, located on the north side of Gem Street in the Castle Ward.\nAll external activities of adventurers commissioned by the Jewelers Guild were closely monitored by the Red Sashes and Shadow Thieves. It was rumored that at least two high-ranking members of the guild had ties with the Shadow Thieves.\nDuring the Guildwars of the mid–13 century DR, Lord Parnak Deepwinter allegedly conspired with Jewelers Guildmaster Yivvik Chourm to create a powerful faction by merging the Jewelerss Guild with the Guild of Silversmiths and Gilders (then controlled by the Deepwinter family). Lord Parnak was the fourth son and not likely to become the leader of the guild, but assassination of all the other noble members of the clan brought him to power and the merger was accomplished. After Lord Parnak died in the fire that consumed his family villa, the Deepwinters and the Guild of Silversmiths and Gilders ceased to exist.\nIn the mid‒14 century DR, the Jewelers Guild donated a copy of the book Jewel and Gemcutting to the library of Bard Keep near Silverymoon.\nBy the , the guildmaster of the Jewelers Guild was Master Jeweler Stromquil Halazar, who also owned the shop Halazars Fine Gems in the Sea Ward. The spokesperson for the guild was Gentleman Speaker for the Jewelers Jhauntar Olmhazan, who also owned and operated the shop Olmhazans Jewels in the Castle Ward.\nMembership into the guild cost an initial entry fee of 40 gp, plus an annual membership fee of 25 gp."
