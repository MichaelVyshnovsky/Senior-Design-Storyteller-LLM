        "mainbody": "The '''Grey Riders''' (also '''Gray Riders''') were a group of around twenty [[ranger]]s on horseback who were protectors of [[Harrowdale]] in the [[Dalelands]]. Their primary purpose as of 1368 DR was to guard against monsters and bandits in the forests and woods of the dale.",
        "Activities": "By 1374 DR, the [[Council of Seven Burghers]] had recruited twelve Grey Riders to operate from [[Velartree]].",
        "History": "In 1368 DR, the Grey Riders had no powers of arrest, and their duty was simply to watch for threats, and, if necessary, seek support from other dales. However, by 1374 DR, the Grey Riders had been granted the power of arrest, to keep prisoners, and to transport them to [[New Velar|Harrowdale Town]] for \"Council justice\"."
