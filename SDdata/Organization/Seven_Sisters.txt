The Seven Sisters were seven immortal women, all Chosen of Mystra and daughters of the goddess Mystra, the second Goddess of Magic. They were all Chaotic, Neutral or Good spellcasters born to the ranger Dornal Silverhand and his sorcerer wife Elué Silverhand (nee Shundar), whom Mystra possessed to give birth to the children. Notably, the seventh was unborn due to the death of Elué, therefore, divine intervention made the seventh daughter reborn in the unborn miscarried child of Eilistraean drow Iliryztara Veladorn.
* Anastra Syluné Silverhand, more commonly known as "Syluné", the kindly Witch of Shadowdale, who was slain in 1356 DR by a red dragon but remained in Faerûn as a ghostly spectral harpist. She continued to exist in 1491 DR as a Weaveghost. Her husband was Aumry Obarskyr the Lord of Shadowdale until his death in 1339 DR.
* Alustriel Silverhand ("Endué Alustriel Silverhand" was her birth name), the regal but unashamed Lady of Silverymoon, founder of the nation of the Silver Marches. She was renowned for her many children (The Tall Ones, etc) from different fathers.
* Dove Falconhand ("Ambara Dove Silverhand" was her birth name), whose magic was second to her skill at arms, for she was a ranger and a renowned Knight of Myth Drannor married to another Knight, Florin Falconhand. She was the mother of Azalar Falconhand. She died from her battle wounds against the dying Vattick Tanthul in 1487 DR and later existed as a Weaveghost alongside her sister Anastra and Qilué.
* Storm Silverhand ("Ethena Astorma Silverhand" was her birth name), a famous and much-loved Harper, sorceress, and Bard of Shadowdale, who, despite sometimes appearing flighty, Her consort was Maxan Maxer.
* Laeral Silverhand Arunsun ("Anamanué Laeral Silverhand" was her birth name), the radiant and good-hearted Lady of Waterdeep, who married the great wizard Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun and with him led the secretive organization known as the Moonstars (who were once Harpers).
* The Simbul ("Alassra Shentrantra Silverhand" was her birth name, but few knew it and fewer used it) was the Witch Queen of the eastern kingdom of Aglarond, former lover of Elminster and once the most powerful sorceress in all Faerûn—her kingdom stayed intact only because of the might she could bring against the nefarious Red Wizards of Thay and their zulkirs.
* Qilué Veladorn, the youngest daughter, was not widely known like her sisters—when she was whispered of she was called "The Dark Sister"—and that was probably a good thing for she was a drow (born to Mystra in exceptionally odd circumstances), but also a fair and mighty priestess of both Mystra and the good drow goddess Eilistraee. She was slain by the Lady Penitent, Halisstra Melarn, in 1379 DR, and became a Weaveghost as a result.
As the Chosen of Mystra, each sister is gifted with a special power.
* Syluné Unknown.
* Alustriel Spellcast.
* Dove Magic Arms (armor and weapons).
* Storm Immunity to all forms of natural electricity, but will physically recover instead if hit.
* Laeral Magic Items.
* The Simbul Unknown.
* Qilué Dual Chosen of Mystra and Eilistraee.
After Elué died in the , Dornal abandoned his daughters and they were cared for by various foster parents. Their father later died and became The Watcher of the Weave.
During the Second Sundering in the 1480s DR, five of the Seven Sisters vanished and were presumed deceased. Storm and Dove remained, but much diminished in magical power and living under assumed names. In the , Laeral and Alustriel came out of hiding to assist Elminster in securing Mystras Weave and stopped Shars quest to seize dominance over magic from Mystra.
