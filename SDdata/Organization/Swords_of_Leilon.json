        "mainbody": "The Swords of Leilon was an adventuring company based in Leilon.\nThe Swords of Leilon were a ragtag band of local thugs that fought very well together.\nThe Swords looted and survived six of the Mage-Tombs near Leilon, slaughtered a lizardfolk tribe in the Mere of Dead Men, and guarded some caravans in Neverwinter.\nAround 1357 DR, the Swords lost some of their members in Ironford fighting wizard-led hobgoblins and they wanted revenge.\nSometime in 15th century DR, a group of Swords returned to Leilon, in ghostly form, during the time of Cryovains reign at Icespire Peak and the rise of the Cult of Talos along the Sword Coast North. They helped defend Leilon during the Siege of Leilon.\n*Aubrey Silverspun\n*Augusta Krul\n*Ogri Ninebeards"
