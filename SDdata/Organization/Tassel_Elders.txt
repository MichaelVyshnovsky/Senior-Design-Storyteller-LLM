The '''Tassel Elders''' were a group of representatives that assisted with the rule of [[Tasseldale]]. One member was elected from each tassel, typically a wise citizen or pillar of the community, and advised the [[Grand Mairshar]] on decisions of major importance. Their counsel was required before the Lord could create new laws, rally the dale's militia, or deploy the [[Mairshars]] outside of Tasseldale.  

The Elders' approval was required when an outgoing Grand Mairshar selected their successor before retirement.
