The Ragnor were a dangerous tribe of Nars found in eastern Narfell. There were 1,900 Ragnor in 1357 DR.
Because of their close proximity to some of the savage people of Rashemen and Ashanath, the Ragnor found themselves constantly at war. They were slightly less hostile to any other outsiders they encountered.
The Ragnor were found among the Teardrops of eastern Narfell.
