The '''Iron Legion''' was a disbanded mercenary company by [[1358 DR]].

==History==
The Iron Legion was the combined army that fought the [[arcanaloth]] [[Yrkhetep]] in his home plane of [[Hades]]. Most of its members died in the decisive battle. Only two of the many groups that composed the Legion remained active: the [[Windriders]] and the [[Sisterhood of the Oaks]].
