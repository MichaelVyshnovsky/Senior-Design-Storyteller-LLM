The Midler family was a farming household that lived near the village of Eveningstar in Cormyr during the 15 century DR, led by the family patriarch Ricnan Midler. They were joined there by the Chandler family, who had married into the Midlers.
During the Darkening and the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar in the mid-1480s DR, the Midler farmhouse outside of Eveningstar was overtaken by the cruel priestess of Lolth Vicala Szind. Vicalas forces, including her pet spider Akorstra and Warleader Speitar DunRobar, held the entire extended family hostage while interrogating them for clues as to the location of the Thread of the Weave. Their cook Maisby managed to evade detection and hid in the shed behind the house, waiting there for a full night and day before stealthily moving to Eveningstar to get help.
In response to the call for aid, two Purple Dragons including Vicben Arroway moved to investigate, only to be overcome by the drow invaders. A team of adventurers were sent next, who found that Vicben and the whole Midler family had been magically linked to Vicala Szind, allowing her to drain their life force to replenish her own, and forcing the adventurers to handle the situation very carefully. While Vicben was slain, the rest of the Midler family may have been rescued safely without Vicala having the chance to sacrifice them as her shields.
Regardless of the outcome, their servant Maisby moved on to hopefully calmer employment, only to become part of a vampire plot at Sable Manor.
