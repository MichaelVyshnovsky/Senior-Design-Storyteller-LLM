The Glass-breakers were a group of fanatical gnomes who lived on an uncharted island in the middle of Yal Tengri in the 14 century DR.
The sole purpose of the Glass-breakers was to thwart the construction of the Great Spire of the Ice Sea that was being built by a cult of Gond circa 1359 DR. They achieved this by executing nighttime raids on the spire where they damaged the spire, burned factories, and scared the workers.
Lurdas Jasperstone organized the group of gnomes who would become the Glass-breakers.
