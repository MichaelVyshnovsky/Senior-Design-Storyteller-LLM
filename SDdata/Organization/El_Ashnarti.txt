The '''Ashnarti''' family of crime lords was one of the smaller crime families in [[Calimshan]], with its base in [[Keltar]], and was known for its brutes and thugs.<ref name=EotSS-p110>

The headquarters of the Guild of Enforcers and Thugs of Calimshan was located in Keltar<ref name=EotSS-p72> and was the only rogues' guild of note in the city. In [[1370 DR]], this guild was in the control of the sultan of Keltar, [[Duncan el Ashnarti]], allowing him to control both illegal and legal activity there. Duncan was married to a niece of [[el Ahimar]] family, one of the four major crime families in [[Calimshan]], which was in turn subservient to [[el Pesarkhal]] family and the [[syl-pasha]] himself, so the entire Ashnarti family and the underworld of Keltar was in control of [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]].<ref name=EotSS-p110/>
