'''House Marliir''' was a noble house of [[Cormyr]], based in [[Suzail]].

==Activities==
The family were always outsiders at the Royal Court<ref> and had extensive landholdings and businesses in the [[Arabel]] area.<ref>

==History==
The Marliirs led the Marsemban infantry fighting with King [[Galaghard Obarskyr III]] against the Witch-Lords in the {{YearlinkName|900}}. The house fought against [[Dhalmass Obarskyr]] in [[Marsember]] and was part of the [[Redlance Rising]], and was in tax trouble since that time.

The house also backed the regent [[Salember]] in a civil war. 

However, the family remained loyal to King [[Azoun IV]] when [[Gondegal]] attempted to seize the throne in the {{YearlinkName|1352}}.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, heavy rain lasted for two entire seasons, spring and summer. This downpour caused a sinkhole underneath stables of a respectable Arabellan inn, within a hundred steps of [[Lady's Hall (Arabel)|the Lady's Hall]], the temple of Tymora. The collapsed building exposed a hidden shrine to [[Beshaba]] and killed thirty-seven worshipers of Lady Luck's hateful sister [[Beshaba]]. A lesser cousin of House Marliir was among those dead worshipers of Beshaba. The High Lord Priest [[Daramos Lauthyr]] chose to lie about the noble's association and claimed that the dead Marliir was at the stables when the disaster struck. The High Priest wanted to play the game of politics and avoid scandals while gaining good standing for his church.

The Marliirs were at one time the largest noble house in Arabel. but this changed inthe {{YearlinkName|1396}}, when King [[Azoun V]] married [[Nalara Marliir]] and the house moved to Suzail. In the 15{{th}} century DR, the family's fortunes waned.

==Relations==
The Marliirs and the [[Huntcrown]]s hated each other and were close to open conflict in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|?}}
