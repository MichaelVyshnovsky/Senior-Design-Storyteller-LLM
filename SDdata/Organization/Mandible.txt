The Mandible was the most powerful gang operating in Skullport in the late 15th century DR. Next to the Skulls of Skullport The Mandible was the closest thing to a government the town had.  The gang took its name from a sword known as Dragons Tooth which was found in the ruins of the old town.  The sword served as a badge of office for the gangs leader and, since gang members bickered frequently amongst themselves, possession of the sword changed hands often.
