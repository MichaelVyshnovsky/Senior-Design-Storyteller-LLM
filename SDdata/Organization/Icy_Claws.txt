The '''Icy Claws of Iyraclea''' were a group of [[gelugon]]s who served the self-proclaimed Ice Queen [[Iyraclea]] on the [[Great Glacier]].

==Description==
Each of the Icy Claws was more powerful and better trained then the typical ice devil from [[Cania]] would be.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Frozen Wastes}}

==Notable Members==
The Icy Claw [[Tosvin]], while investigating the ancient [[giant]] ruins of [[Gharreil]] for Iyraclea, was chosen by the last [[Prince of Jhoth√ªn]] to be Gharreil's portal guardian.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Frozen Wastes: The Great Glacier}}
