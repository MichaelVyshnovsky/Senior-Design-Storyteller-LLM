The Icy Claws of Iyraclea were a group of gelugons who served the self-proclaimed Ice Queen Iyraclea on the Great Glacier.
Each of the Icy Claws was more powerful and better trained then the typical ice devil from Cania would be.
The Icy Claw Tosvin, while investigating the ancient giant ruins of Gharreil for Iyraclea, was chosen by the last Prince of Jhoth√ªn to be Gharreils portal guardian.
