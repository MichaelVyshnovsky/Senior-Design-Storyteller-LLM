The Zealots of the Written Word, who were often simply called the Zealots or the Carmendines after their founder, was an adventuring group devoted to Deneir, the Lord of All Glyphs.
The group was founded by Carmendine.
The Zealots would travel with Deneirrath clerics on missions and holy quests in order to raise funds for the church.
