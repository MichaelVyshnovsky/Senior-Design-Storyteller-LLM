The '''Holy Warriors of Suffering''' were a knightly order of [[paladin]]s devoted to [[Ilmater]], the Broken God, and affiliated with the [[Church of Ilmater]].

==Base==
The Holy Warriors of Suffering were based out of a fortress located on the site of what was later [[Castle Dasaajk]], east of the [[Purple Hills]] in [[Tethyr]].

==Activities==
The Holy Warriors undertook various dangerous missions and expeditions to cull monsters.

==History==
After enchanting the sword ''[[Dornavver]]'' in the [[275 DR|Year of the Wrath Sword, 275 DR]], the [[Church of Ilmater]] entrusted the blade to the Holy Warriors of Suffering. They desired that it should be used to battle the spread of evil around southwestern [[Faer√ªn]], particularly [[fiend]]s. ''Dornavver'' was kept and wielded by the Holy Warriors for over a century.

Finally, an unnamed paladin of the order took the sword and journeyed north to the realm of [[Torsil]], then under the tyrannical rule of [[Uldoon]], "the Mage of Fangs", whose armies of summoned [[fiend]]s had terrorized the surrounding lands. Wielding ''Dornavver'', the paladin battled through the fiends of Torsil and defeated Uldoon. These heroic deeds were recorded in the ballad "[[Uldoon's Doom]]". Following the downfall of Uldoon, the paladin then traveled west of the [[Heartlands]], bearing the sword. Its whereabouts were unknown for over a hundred years.

Around [[1265 DR]], Archsufferer [[Bloirt Waelarn]] of the [[House of the Broken God]] in [[Keltar]] had denounced the Ilmatari priests of the [[House of Holy Suffering]] in [[Mussum]] for refusing to relinquish the ''[[Tome of Torment]]'', the holiest book of the faith, and declared them degenerate, mentally ill heretics. The Mussum priests and the [[Companions of the Noble Heart]] attacked Waelarn and his followers, labeling them "false clerics" and "subverted by evil". An angry Waelarn summoned the Holy Warriors of Suffering, as well as the [[Knights of the Bleeding Shield]], and the [[Order of the Golden Cup]], to his side and vowed holy war against the "unclean ones of Mussum" and their allies. The war saw the violent clashes of [[Holy Hill Farm]] in [[1266 DR]] and [[Bronsheir's Charge]] and [[Weeping Rock (Ilmater)|Weeping Rock]] in [[1267 DR]]. Finally, Lord Sir [[Jargus Holenhond]] of the Golden Cup called an end to the bloodshed between true believers, insisted that the ''Tome of Torment'' be transferred to Keltar as planned, and blamed Bloirt Waelarn for the senseless violence, determining that he should be removed from office and sent into hermitage for the remainder of his years. The weary paladins accepted and carried out his judgment.

Shortly after the war, [[Althea|Althea the Abased]], the new leader of the House of the Broken God, declared that no high-ranking member of the church was worthy of the ''Tome''. Althea selected [[Blaermon|Blaermon the Blessed]], a knight of the Holy Warriors of Suffering named for surviving many hopeless battles, to take away the ''Tome of Torment'' and bestow it upon the first "needy and worthy" Ilmatari he met, someone who worked or fought for the benefit of the common people and their faith, not merely for wealth and adventure. In the [[1264 DR|Year of the Daystars, 1268 DR]], Blaermon gave the ''Tome'' to [[Flaergon]] of [[Glister]], who devoted his efforts to assisting miners and caravan-workers in the frozen north of the [[Moonsea]].

The ''Tome'' was again in the possession of the House of the Broken God from [[1343 DR]] to [[1362 DR]], during which time it was occasionally loaned to Ilmatari priests embarking on dangerous missions and monster culls with the Holy Warriors of Suffering.
