The '''Skullsmashers''' were a tribe of unusually strong and fierce [[ogre]]s who made their base in [[Fangjaws Hold]] in [[Thar]]. They were known to enslave "lesser" neighbors such as [[goblin]]s and even [[human]]s and [[dwarves]], working them hard, usually to death in just a few months.{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/drrl/20071217a|title=The Tribes of Thar|accessdate=2007-12-21|author=[[Richard Baker]]|date=2007-12-17|work=Realmslore|publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]}}

==History==
In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the tribe was led by a brutish two-headed ogre named [[Zar-Umak]]. It was a matter of speculation among the tribe as to whether he was part [[ettin]] or not. Under his leadership, the tribe was notable for having subdued neighboring tribes around Fangjaws Hold.

In the mid-to-late late 15{{th}} century DR, the tribe was led by the ogre [[Guld]]. Under his leadership, the tribe joined a coalition of monstrous tribes led by the powerful [[Blood Skull]] [[orcs]] to raid the nearby human settlements of the [[Moonsea]]. The Skullsmashers participated in the destruction of [[Glister]] and the subsequent attack on [[Hulburg]], which ended with the coalition being scattered at the [[Battle of Lendon's Dike]]. This defeat weakened the Blood Skulls and created a power vacuum among the [[goblinoid]] and [[giant|giantkin]] tribes of Thar, such as the Skulllsmashers, who began warring with each other for supremacy.
