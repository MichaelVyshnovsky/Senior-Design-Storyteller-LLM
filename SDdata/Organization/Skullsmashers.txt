The Skullsmashers were a tribe of unusually strong and fierce ogres who made their base in Fangjaws Hold in Thar. They were known to enslave "lesser" neighbors such as goblins and even humans and dwarves, working them hard, usually to death in just a few months.
In the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the tribe was led by a brutish two-headed ogre named Zar-Umak. It was a matter of speculation among the tribe as to whether he was part ettin or not. Under his leadership, the tribe was notable for having subdued neighboring tribes around Fangjaws Hold.
In the mid-to-late late 15 century DR, the tribe was led by the ogre Guld. Under his leadership, the tribe joined a coalition of monstrous tribes led by the powerful Blood Skull orcs to raid the nearby human settlements of the Moonsea. The Skullsmashers participated in the destruction of Glister and the subsequent attack on Hulburg, which ended with the coalition being scattered at the Battle of Lendons Dike. This defeat weakened the Blood Skulls and created a power vacuum among the goblinoid and giantkin tribes of Thar, such as the Skulllsmashers, who began warring with each other for supremacy.
