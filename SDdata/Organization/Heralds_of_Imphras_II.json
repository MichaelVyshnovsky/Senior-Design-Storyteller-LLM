        "mainbody": "he Heralds of Imphras II were couriers who carried news to the far corners of Impiltur on behalf of the Lords of Imphras II as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe Heralds were couriers and messengers, who travelled by horseback in bands along Impilturs major roads, ranging as far as Haelimbrars Watch. While their primary role was to bring news from Impilturs major population centers to the outlying villages, the Heralds more broadly served as a line of communication between the rulers and its common folk. They acted as patrols on the roads which they travelled, with each band being led by a veteran fighter empowered to enforce the law.\nWhenever the Heralds learned of a newcomer to the realm along one of their roads, they sought them out. The Heralds were always courteous and helpful to new arrivals unless they deemed them to be a threat to the people of Impiltur, in which case they proved formidable foes."
