The Xendreth was the ruling council of Malydren, composed of both the preeminent wizards and clerics of the ixzan city.
Unlike most ixzan communities, mutant ixzan, such as temperamental Bhylqex, were allowed to join the clergy and become wizards, so they could also join the council. For many centuries, the council was in fact strongly influenced by the two vampiric ixzan Zekaqux and Phiaqiv.
