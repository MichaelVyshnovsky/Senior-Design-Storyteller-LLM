The '''Thorntower''' family was a branch of the nobility of [[Cormyr]].

==Members==
In early spring of the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, one of the young scions of the family was involved in the [[Marsember]] meeting of the [[Rightful Conspiracy]]. Some remarked on the man's lustfulness in his amorous activities with the pleasure-lass [[Tharmoraera]], and others on his arrogance in believing that only the ''right'' nobles (for example, himself) really knew Cormyr and should either lead the effort to depose the [[Obarskyr]]s or even replace them.
