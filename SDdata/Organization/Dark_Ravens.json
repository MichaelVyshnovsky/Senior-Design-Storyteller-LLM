        "mainbody": "'''Dark Ravens''' was an order of [[monk]] [[assassin]]s for hire, active sometimes in and before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "Dark Ravens were an esoteric splinter sect of the little-known [[Black Raven Monastery]], The monks were known as some of the most deadly assassins [[coin]] could buy.",
        "History": "Sometime before the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Dark Ravens were hired through coin and some unknown twisted deals and agreements by several [[drow house]]s of [[Menzoberranzan]] to remove their adversary [[House Uoswiir]] from the scene. The assassins attacked and wiped out the house almost completely. The only person who escaped the slaughter was the heiress â€“ [[Vhaidra Uoswiir]]. Her half-sister, [[Ulua]], survived as well, but only because the assassins considered her to be a half-breed and not part of the noble line. For some time, Ulua was unsure if her sister survived the fall of House Uoswiir, receiving conflicting reports from her contacts. Subsequently, Ulua reconnected with Vhaidra, who took to the adventuring life and planned vengeance on the heads of her family's enemies. During that time, Ulua conducted operations to regroup surviving House Uoswiir allies and plotted to eliminate its rivals.\n\nUlua eventually learned the location of the Dark Raven Monastery and passed the information long to her sister. Vhaidra stormed this monastery and found its archimandrite, [[Draezen Direhand]]. He dismissed Ulua's existence on the grounds that she was only of half-Uoswiir blood and said that House Uoswiir would die with Vhaidra. Once the half-sister returned to Baldur's Gate victorious, Ulua informed her that she had already sent agents to destroy the monastery, having heard of her success and that, when Vhaidra was ready to take up her place as head of the Uoswiir household, she would not stand alone."
