        "mainbody": "The '''Argent Legion''' was the state army of [[Luruar]].",
        "Activities": "Formed in an attempt to ensure the safety of the smaller settlements of Luruar, the Argent Legion's forces were drawn from the various armies maintained by the more powerful city-states of that nation. Its purpose is to patrol Luruar's territory and garrison its settlements.",
        "Base of Operations": "Based in Rauvinwatch Keep, which stood roughly 15 miles west of [[Silverymoon]], the legion maintained a force of 400 troops (mostly dwarves) who spent their time either training or going out on patrols with the [[Knights in Silver]]. The other half of the Legion were stationed in or around [[Citadel Felbarr]] (100 dwarves, 100 Knights in Silver) and [[Sundabar]] (200 soldiers), which had both seen heavy fighting prior to the formation of the Legion. A force of 50 Legionnaires were also stationed in [[Jalanthar]] as it was a frequent target for [[orc]] and [[Uthgardt]] raids.",
        "Membership": "Any member of Luruar's various official state military forces could be transferred into the Legion. Many cities chose to send their barely-trained new recruits to maintain their commitment to the force while not losing their own veterans. In [[1372 DR]] the group numbered 850 soldiers - 200 Knights in Silver (Silverymoon), 250 [[Iron Guard]] ([[Citadel Adbar]]), 200 [[Shieldsar]] (Sundabar), 50 [[dwarf|dwarves]] each from Citadel Felbarr and [[Mithral Hall]], and 100 archers & cavalry from the [[Army of the Vale]] ([[Everlund]]).",
        "Leadership": "[[Methrammar Aerasumé]] was appointed High Marshal of the Legion by his mother, [[Alustriel Silverhand]]. An able warrior, Methrammar was an excellent drillmaster whose training regimen turned green youths into elite warriors.\n\nThe High Marshal of the Legion was considered the seventh member of the [[Nine Peers]] council that governed the [[League of the Silver Marches]].",
        "Notable Members of the Argent legion": "* [[Methrammar Aerasumé]], [[half-elf]], High Marshal of the Legion in [[1372 DR]].\n* [[Badel Kilmander]], [[human]], commander of the company stationed in Jalanthar in 1372 DR.\n* [[Jandar Starblade]], half-elf, [[paladin]] commander of the company station in Citadel Felbarr in 1372 DR."
