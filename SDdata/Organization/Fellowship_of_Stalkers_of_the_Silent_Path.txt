The Fellowship of Stalkers of the Silent Path was a group of specialty priests, called rangers devoted to Gwaeron Windstrom, the Tracker Who Never Goes Astray.
Stalkers of the Silent Path, which was how the rangers where known, led solitary lives deep in the forests. Their only companionship came in the form of a loyal bloodhound.
