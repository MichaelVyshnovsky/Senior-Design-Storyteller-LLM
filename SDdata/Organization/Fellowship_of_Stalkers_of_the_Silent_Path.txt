The '''Fellowship of Stalkers of the Silent Path''' was a group of [[specialty priest]]s, called [[Ranger (priest)|rangers]] devoted to [[Gwaeron Windstrom]], the Tracker Who Never Goes Astray.

==Activities==
Stalkers of the Silent Path, which was how the rangers where known, led solitary lives deep in the forests. Their only companionship came in the form of a loyal [[bloodhound]].
