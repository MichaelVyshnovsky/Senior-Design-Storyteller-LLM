Even mention of their name caused whispers and excited murmurs. The company was mentioned by King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] when then-unknown [[adventurer]]s – [[Knights of Myth Drannor|Swords of Eveningstar]], were granted Cormyr's official adventuring charter. King Azoun held a grand ceremony in the town of [[Espar]] and competed the young adventurers to the still famed Company of the Manticore Cloaks, predicting the Swords' bright future, reaching the fame and prosperity of the Trollbloods and the [[Company of the Manticore Cloaks]]."
