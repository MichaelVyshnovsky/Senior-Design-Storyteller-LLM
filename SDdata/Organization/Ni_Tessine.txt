NiTessine was a noble sun elven house of Cormanthyr.
The familys ruling line used heraldry colored in pegasus-related colors such as powder-white and sky-blue. Lesser lines used griffon-related colors such as dun-brown and gold.
Following the destruction of Myth Drannor in the 8 century DR, many members of the NiTessine clan emigrated to the city of SeluMaraar in the sea elven realm of Serôs. Along with other immigrant clans, they were looked down on by the  "native" Serôsian elves even though the majority of the citys population originally hailed from other "surface elven" communities.
As of the 14 century DR, the clan also had a presence in Waterdeep. This branch of the family, led by Fenian NiTessine, were elven supremacists who violently opposed the romance between Princess Amnestria of Evermeet and the human ranger Bran Skorlsun.
