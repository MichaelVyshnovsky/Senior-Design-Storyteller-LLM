'''Ni'Tessine''' was a noble [[sun elf|sun elven]] house of [[Cormanthyr]].

==Organization==
The family's ruling line used heraldry colored in [[pegasus]]-related colors such as powder-white and sky-blue. Lesser lines used [[griffon]]-related colors such as dun-brown and gold.

==History==
Following the destruction of [[Myth Drannor]] in the 8{{th}} century [[DR]], many members of the Ni'Tessine clan emigrated to the city of [[Selu'Maraar]] in the [[sea elf|sea elven]] realm of [[Serôs]]. Along with other immigrant clans, they were looked down on by the  "native" Serôsian elves even though the majority of the city's population originally hailed from other "surface elven" communities.

As of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the clan also had a presence in [[Waterdeep]]. This branch of the family, led by [[Fenian Ni'Tessine]], were elven supremacists who violently opposed the romance between Princess [[Amnestria]] of [[Evermeet]] and the [[human]] [[ranger]] [[Bran Skorlsun]].{{Cite digital book/Elfshadow|4446}}
