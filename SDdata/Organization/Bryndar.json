        "mainbody": "The '''Bryndar''' were a group rumored to dwell within [[Brynwood]] in [[the Vast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Stories about them varied, but agreed that they were a clan of [[evil]], [[magic]]-using female shapeshifters.{{Cite polyhedron/88/The Everwinking Eye: Treasures of the Vast, Part One|14}}",
        "Activities": "The most common of these stories claimed that they were evil magical creatures who could change their shape into that of a female [[human]]. In this guise, they were said to lure male [[adventurer]]s into the depths of the Brynwood forest and there transformed into [[wolves]], [[giant spider]]s, huge [[snake]]s, or [[owlbear]]s to then devour their victims. Either way, a certain [[minstrel]] wrote a ballad about one of these women, whom he named \"[[Snowhair the Sorceress]]\", a scornful, white-haired mage.\n\nA third story popular in [[tavern]]s in [[Impiltur]] said that the Bryndar (so named in this story) dwelled in an ancient castle with many spires deep in Brynwood, where they developed powerful [[spell]]s and used magical ''[[gate]]s'' or ''[[portal]]s'' to travel to far-flung cities like [[Airspur (Chessenta)|Airspur]], [[Telflamm]], [[Westgate]], and [[Waterdeep]]. There they sought [[magic]] by underhanded means, using stealth or [[poison]] to drug or slay [[wizard]]s and rob them of whatever they could. With enough magical power, they would one day emerge from the Brynwood and attempt to take over and rule the world with their Art\n\nThough completely unproven, this last tale was particularly vivid and persistent. By [[1370 DR]], the [[sage]] [[Elminster]] theorized that some unknown person or force was spreading or maintaining this tale of the Bryndar to lure adventures into the forest for some reason. Certainly, three [[adventuring company|adventuring companies]] of note had vanished after venturing into Brynwood over a ten-year period."
