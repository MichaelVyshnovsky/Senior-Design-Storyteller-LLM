The Desai were a Bedine tribe located in Anauroch. By 1468 DR, they were nominally under the rule of Netheril.
On the Spring Equinox (Ches 19) in 1463 DR, Ruqiah (the reincarnated Catti-brie) was born to Kavita and Niraj of the Desai tribe. In 1468 DR, the Shadovar agents Untaris and Alpirs DeNoutess attempted to kidnap her on behalf of Parise Ulfbinder, but Ruqiah killed them with her divine magic. Soon after, Ruqiah was forced to flee the tribe but returned regularly to gain magical training from her parents.
In 1468 DR, a Desai encampment of tents was located at the remains of the ancient city Rasileth.
Like other Bedine tribes, the Desai were forbidden to practice magic, but some (namely Kavita and Niraj) secretly did so anyway.
A typical outfit of a Desai man was a round, white cotton garment set with a large button and tassel. Like other Bedine, a Desai man wore a kufiya headscarf and an igal tie that spoke of their stature in the tribe.
The Desais primary gods were Nasr, god of the dead, and Atar the Merciless, the Yellow Goddess of the desert.
The discovery of a wellspring in the desert was celebrated all night long.
