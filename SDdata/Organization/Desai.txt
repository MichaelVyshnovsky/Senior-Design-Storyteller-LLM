The '''Desai''' were a [[Bedine]] tribe located in [[Anauroch]]. By [[1468 DR]], they were nominally under the rule of [[Netheril]].

==History==
On the Spring Equinox ([[Ches 19]]) in [[1463 DR]], [[Ruqiah]] (the reincarnated [[Catti-brie]]) was born to [[Kavita]] and [[Niraj]] of the Desai tribe. In [[1468 DR]], the [[Shadovar]] agents [[Untaris]] and [[Alpirs De'Noutess]] attempted to kidnap her on behalf of [[Parise Ulfbinder]], but Ruqiah killed them with her divine magic. Soon after, Ruqiah was forced to flee the tribe but returned regularly to gain magical training from her parents.

In [[1468 DR]], a Desai encampment of tents was located at the remains of the ancient city [[Rasileth]].

==Culture==
Like other Bedine tribes, the Desai were forbidden to practice magic, but some (namely Kavita and Niraj) secretly did so anyway.

A typical outfit of a Desai man was a round, white cotton garment set with a large button and tassel. Like other Bedine, a Desai man wore a ''[[wikipedia:en:Keffiyeh|kufiya]]'' headscarf and an ''[[igal]]'' tie that spoke of their stature in the tribe.

The Desai's primary gods were [[N'asr]], god of the dead, and [[At'ar]] the Merciless, the Yellow Goddess of the desert.

The discovery of a wellspring in the desert was celebrated all night long.
