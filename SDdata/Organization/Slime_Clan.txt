The Slime Clan were a tribe of derro living in the Underdark near Delzimmer in southern Faerûn. The tribe lived in a huge cave and had crude stone huts as dwellings. The only building of substance was a large stone building in which their leader lived and in which the derro performed bizarre experiments. The cavern contained portals to the Far Realm through which denizens passed only to be captured by the derro.
The clan was ruled by the Slime King. In the past, an aboleth and a mind flayer had been the Slime King. As of 1479 DR, the Slime King was a yuan-ti pureblood named Iraska who had been enslaved by the derro but managed to manipulate her way to leadership.
