The '''Lords of Waterdeep''' were the mysterious and predominantly anonymous ruling council of [[Waterdeep]], having governed the city from the 11{{th}} century onwards.

==Organization==
A full council comprised 20 Lords, though this number might vary from 16 to 29.<ref> The full number of Lords was not always known and some Lords were kept secret 

===Open Lord===
[[File:LordsOfWaterdeep.png|thumb|right|300px|Open Lord [[Piergeiron the Paladinson|Piergeiron]] and a Masked Lord in official garments ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].]]
The Open Lord of Waterdeep (also called the "Unmasked Lord") was the sole member of the Lords of Waterdeep whose identity was publicly known. The Open Lord was also the city's chief diplomat.

There were seven [[Lords of Waterdeep#Open Lord|Open Lords]] of [[Waterdeep]] to [[1489 DR]]; [[Ahghairon]] the Mage, [[Baeron Silmaeril]], [[Lhestyn]] the Masked Lady, [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]], [[Caladorn Cassalanter]], [[Dagult Neverember]], and [[Laeral Silverhand|Lady Laeral Silverhand]].<ref name="SCAG-p55" >

=== Masked Lords ===
The Lords of Waterdeep were only seen in public when sitting in the Lord's Court or when appearing every four years at [[Shieldmeet]] Council when the Lord's Rule is reaffirmed. The identities of the Lords, other than the Open Lord, were not supposed to be known to the public, although they were known to each other. The intent of this was to ensure that the Lords were free of coercion and could be drawn from any social strata within the city. While the masked Lords were considered to be equal to the Open Lord in authority, some executive authority was reserved for the Open Lord, including the vetting and selection of new Lords, the naming of the next Open Lord,<ref> and determining the needed number of Lords.

==Activities==
Ultimate legal authority in Waterdeep fell to the Open and masked Lords of Waterdeep. The Open Lord and at least two others attended the [[Lord's Court]] while it was in session, enforcing the city-state's set of rules and laws known as the [[Code Legal]]. The lords listened to the most severe crimes committed against the city and the Waterdhavian people. They also appeared on occasion when asked to by Waterdhavian lower courts, but always only few in number. It was extremely rare for more than seven Lords to sit in Court on a particular occasion, except at Sheildmeet.

The Lords helped maintain peace and order within the city and beyond,<ref group="note">The Lords of Waterdeep cannot be held responsible for the flogging, banishment, incarceration, or execution of adventurers who violate the Code Legal, nor are the Lords responsible for the actions of beholder crime lords, unscrupulous nobles, drow swashbucklers, and evil clones. by directing the four branches of the Waterdhavian armed forces, namely the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]], the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]], the [[Griffon Cavalry]], and the city's naval forces. They also held direct command over the actions of [[Force Grey]], 

The Lords also held some power over Waterdeep's economic status, controlling the minting of coinage and [[trade bar]]s. They also possessed sole authority to grant nobility to Waterdhavians of great wealth and influence that petitioned as such. 

They also controlled diplomatic relations. The Lords had final say in whether to approve the erection of proposed embassies of foreign agents and governments being built within city limits. The Open Lord also represented Waterdeep in the [[Council of Lords (disambiguation)|Council of Lords]].  

===Lords' Rule===
Every [[Shieldmeet]], at the Shieldmeet Council, the Lords' Rule was reaffirmed.

===Anonymity===
While no other Lords were formally named, some individuals became the subject of widespread rumors that could even become a general consensus. The penalty for impersonating a Lord, whether by dressing in a set of their identical clothing or by a false claim, was punishable by the impostor's immediate execution.

At any time, the Open Lord could demand the private unmasking of any person posing as a masked Lord, under punishment of death for refusal.

==Base of Operations==
While the Lords only officially gathered within the Lord's Court, the Open Lord made full use of the [[Palace of Waterdeep]] in full view of the city's populace.

==Possessions==
[[File:Lord's ensemble-5e.png|thumb|right|300px|The Masked Lords each appeared identical to one another, thanks to their magical raiments.]]
All Masked Lords wore black formless robes and spoke through the Open Lord, in order to keep their identities secret. These magical items—known as the [[Lord's ensemble]] or "Lords Effects"—included [[illusion]]-enhanced robes, a heavily [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] helm, the numerous magical Lord's Rings, and the Lord's Amulet.

Some powerful spellcasters were capable of piercing through the illusion magic that maintained the Masked Lords' identities.

==Relationships==
The Lords maintained numerous contacts throughout Waterdeep, even in the less-reputable places, such as the underground city of [[Skullport]]. These individuals often aided agents working on behalf of the Lords, or acted as their eyes and ears within the city streets.

Interestingly enough, Waterdeep's system of rule was so iconic throughout the [[Sword Coast]], that it was more or less mimicked by other governing bodies, such as the [[Council of Guilds]] in [[Daggerford]].

==History==
The first Open Lord Ahghairon ascended his role in the {{YearlinkName|1032}}, marked by the beginning of the [[Northreckoning]] calendar.

The [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian nobility]] was first recognized by Ahghairon and the Lords in the {{YearlinkName|1248}}. This decree proved extremely successful for the Lords and their relationship with the growing number of wealthy merchants in the city and surrounding farmlands. In the years that followed, the two power groups were often at odds with one another, but ultimately the Lords prevented the guilds from gaining too much influence.

The Lords regained governance over the city in the {{YearlinkName|1273}}, and over the course of three years added an additional 14 members to their ranks. [[Baeron Silmaeril]] ascended as the Open Lord and the [[Zoar]] and [[Gildeggh]] noble families were exiled from the city.

Years of peace in Waterdeep ended in the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, when two masked Lords were slain by [[Amril Zoar]], favored son of the outcast Zoar family. 

The Lords of Waterdeep collectively exiled the [[Shadow Thieves]] from the city in the {{YearlinkName|1300}}, and took action to limit the power of any criminal organization within the city in the decades that followed. The troublesome thieves' guild subsequently relocated to [[Amn]] in the south.

After the [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Thultanthar]] returned to [[Faerûn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the Lords of Waterdeep began negotiations with [[Princes of Shade|Prince]] [[Aglarel Tanthul]]. The negotiations went poorly and the burgeoning alliance that was to be formed between the two cities was immediately halted.

In the {{YearlinkName|1400}}, the Lords issued the 'Tarnsmoke Proclamation' effectively legalizing [[bounty hunter|bounty hunting]] within the city and surrounding lands.

When the [[Cult of the Dragon]] reemerged as a threat to the Realms in the 1480s [[DR]], the City of Splendors hosted four sessions of the [[Council of Waterdeep]] in response. During the meetings, the Lords were represented first by Open Lord [[Dagult Neverember]], then by his successor [[Laeral Silverhand]].

==Members==
Throughout the council's history, the exact number of masked Lords was never known, but scholars estimated that there had been between 50 and 80 Lords as of The Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, four of whom had also served as [[#Open Lord|Open Lord]]. The Lords came from all walks of life and while they were predominantly [[human]], they had had members of various races from throughout the Realms. 

===Rumored Lords===
On occasion some individuals garnered suspicion that they were one of Waterdeep's Masked Lords, while in fact they were not. Such was the case with the mercenary fighter [[Daria|Daria the Hammer]].

In [[Mirtul]] of [[1491 DR]], Masked Lord [[Braethan Cazondur]] enacted a conspiracy to kill other Masked Lords and replace them with ones that would be easier to influence. The following 7 Masked Lords of Waterdeep were killed within a short time of one another, in order:

After the voting-in of replacement lords, an additional 6 Masked Lords and the singular Open Lord were also quickly killed, in order:

*Braethan Cazondur, landlord and aspiring tyrant, was killed by [[Suthool]] with an envenomed blade.
