        "mainbody": "Clan Icehammer was an extended family of dwarves that hailed from Icespire Peak in the Sword Mountains during the 14 and 15 centuries DR.\nThe dwarves of Clan Icehammer were avid and successful miners.\nThey dwelled within the small village of Torunedar on the mountains surface, but had grand plans to construct a mighty underground fortress within.\nThe eponymous weapon known as the Icehammer was a dwarven throwing hammer long-associated with the clan with which it shared its name.\nOver time, they developed immense enmity towards frost giants and goblins that also dwelled on and within Icespire Peak.\nAt some point during the late 14 century DR, the frost giant Lakkar acquired the Winterforge, a powerful artifact associated with the Elemental Chaos. Lakkar waged war on the local clan of Icehammer dwarves armed with the powerful weapon bestowed upon him by Thrym himself. The conflict came to an end when Skeld Icehammer, the formidable giant slayer, threw the Icehammer into Lakkars heart, killing the giant and scattering his army to the surrounding lands.\nYears later, Skelds son Florin founded the village of Torunedar on Icespire Peak with the hope and promise of a better life for them all. The dwarves sought to create a new home for their clan and reclaim his fathers Icehammer, which remained stuck within the Winterforge inside the mountain. They discovered rich mithral deposits within Icespire Peak, dug out mines to retrieve the valuable metal, and thrived for years in their new home.\nUnfortunately, Florins expedition to the Winterforge was not as successful. When he uncovered the Winterforge altar, Florin attempted to retrieve the Icehammer, but in doing so disrupted the long-dormant magic within. Soon after, the frost giant Hrimnir eventually subjugated the goblins of the local Winterkill tribe and ordered them to raid the Icehammer holdings. The giant and goblinoid forces took over the dwarves mines as their own and overran Torunedar. Florin refused to let his people abandon Icespire Peak entirely, and struck out against Hrimnir and his minions in an ongoing guerilla conflict.\nAt some point during or around the , the Icehammer dwarves found a new ally an an adventurer from Neverwinter. Working together, the adventurer and Florin along with his clanmates managed to drive the Winterkill goblins from Torunedar and reclaim both their mithral mines and the Icehammer itself. They were then able to strike out against the frost giants, slaying Hrimnirs lieutenants and then the giant leader himself.\nLater one in the 1480S DR, the Cult of the Dragon disrupted Clan Icehammers mithral mining as part of their ongoing effort to accumulate wealth and perform a ritual to summon Tiamat to the Realms. The same hero that fought alongside the Icehammer dwarves returned to aide them once again, working alongside Fitzhugh Montgomery of the Lords Alliance. Together they defeated Dragonsoul Theures from the dwarven mines and exiling the cult from Icespire Peak once and for all.\n* Belauk Foregearm\n* Bolbin Ironbrow\n* Khella Icehammer\n* Orreft Mountwatch"
