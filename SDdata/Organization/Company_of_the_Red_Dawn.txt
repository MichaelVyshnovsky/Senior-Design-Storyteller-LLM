The '''Company of the Red Dawn''' was an adventuring company responsible for an attack on the [[vampire]] [[Noreyth Harpell]] and his associates in [[1315 DR]].

They were recruited and sent by [[Artor Morlin]], the Baron of Blood, to kill Noreyth. Noreyth, his servant [[Dhusarra el Abhuk|Dhusarra yr Fadila el Abhuk]], and two other [[Malar]]ites were ambushed on the Storeroom Level of [[Undermountain]]. The company killed the two other Malarites, but Noreyth and Dhusarra escaped.{{Cite dungeon/126/Vampires of Waterdeep: Blood of Malar}}
