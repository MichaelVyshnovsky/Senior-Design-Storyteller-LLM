        "mainbody": "House Phylund ( The primary family business was acquiring, taming, training, and selling fierce beasts.\nIn the , the head of the family was Urtos Phylund II and his consort Lythis. and two others, but the official heir recognized by the Lords of Waterdeep was Urtos III, son of Urtos I and his consort (and widow), Aridarye. At this time, there were fourteen Phylund nobles in all.\nSpecializing in the many uses of monsters, they captured, bred, and sold monsters as pets, guard beasts, and arena fighters. Those that couldnt be tamed or used in the arena were either released to be hunted for sport or harvested for their flesh, skin, and bones. The Phylunds sponsored both monster hunting expeditions and adventuring parties to procure new beasts. With his marriage to Lady Lythis Mhairuun, Urtos II acquired the secrets and techniques for breeding and training watchspiders for the Phylund clan, which significantly increased the familys already considerable fortunes.\nthumb|right|270px|The Phylund family villa (labeled N40) circa 1372 DR.\nThe Phylund family estate was located in the North Ward on the east side of Copper Street between Julthoon Street and Manycats Alley. The compound included two- and three-story buildings. In the , Urtos I built a grand house in Ardeep Forest that he called a \"hunting lodge\", but it had all the comforts of a noble villa. It was used as a private lodge as well as a base for monster hunting expeditions hosted by the Phylunds.\nThe Phylunds were rivals with other Waterdhavian families that had similar interests in exotic beasts, notably the Brokengulfs, the Gundwynds, and the Ilvastarrs, but there were exceptions. Most prominent was the friendship between Urtos II and Prendergast Brokengulf. The lines were further blurred when Prendergast married Urtos IIs young stepmother, Aridarye.\nThe Phylund family was of Tethyrian descent and the family was ennobled in the . until tragedy befell the family in the , when Urtos II and nine other members of a hunting expedition were reportedly killed by a large pack of wolves. Days later, Urtos I and six beast-wranglers were killed by an owlbear in the basement of the Field of Triumph, supposedly because the elder Urtos grew careless in his grief and a cage had not been secured properly. In reality, both accidents were deliberately caused at the behest of Aridarye. She planned to take over the family business by having her son, Urtos III, be named heir and herself as regent.\nUrtos II did not die in the wolf attack, but he was afflicted with lycanthropy. It took him several tendays to learn that he could remain master of himself during the time of the full moon, but could not control the transformation into a werewolf. Upon hearing news of his fathers death, he returned to Waterdeep less than a tenday after the funeral and claimed his birthright as head of the Phyland clan, much to the shock and vexation of Aridarye. Thereafter, Urtos II spent the nights of the full moon at the Lodge and hid his affliction from everyone with the help of Kharkos, a trusted family butler.\nthumb|right|270px|The Phylund family villa (outlined in red), circa 1492 DR.\nIn the ,\nIn the , amid the chaos during the event known has Halasters Higharvestide, three behirs appeared in the North Ward not far from the Phylund estate. Lord Urtos II and his beast-tamers captured them in good health with minimal property damage and no loss of life.\nEventually, Urtos IIs secret was revealed and the familys fortunes waned. All members who were living at the Lodge moved back to the villa on Copper Street as they tried to put uncomfortable events behind them. By the 1480s DR, the Lodge had fallen into disrepair and a Red Wizard necromancer named Thegger Grynn had moved in and began experimenting on the contents of the Phylund family crypts.\nBy the midâ€“1490s DR, the Phylunds were still in business and still sponsoring groups of adventurers to hunt and capture beasts for their monster mill.\n* Namynie Phylund mother of Bartos I.\n* Bartos Phylund I father of Urtos I.\n* Nydurra Phylund wife of Bartos I.\n* Urtos Phylund I patriarch in the mid-14 century DR.
