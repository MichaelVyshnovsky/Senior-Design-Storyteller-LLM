At this time, there were fourteen Phylund nobles in all.",
        "Activities": "Specializing in the many uses of monsters, they captured, bred, and sold monsters as pets, guard beasts, and arena fighters. Those that couldn't be tamed or used in the arena were either released to be hunted for sport or harvested for their flesh, skin, and bones. The Phylunds sponsored both monster hunting expeditions and adventuring parties to procure new beasts.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|4}} With his marriage to Lady Lythis Mhairuun, Urtos II acquired the secrets and techniques for breeding and training [[watchspider]]s for the Phylund clan, which significantly increased the family's already considerable fortunes.",
        "Base of Operations": "[[File:North Ward-Phylund Villa.png|thumb|right|270px|''The Phylund family villa (labeled N40) circa 1372 DR.'']]\nThe Phylund family estate was located in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] on the east side of [[Copper Street]] between [[Julthoon Street]] and [[Manycats Alley]]. The compound included two- and three-story buildings. In the {{YearlinkName|1346}}, Urtos I built a [[Phylund Hunting Lodge|grand house in Ardeep Forest]] that he called a \"hunting lodge\", but it had all the comforts of a noble villa. It was used as a private lodge as well as a base for monster hunting expeditions hosted by the Phylunds.",
        "Relationships": "The Phylunds were rivals with other Waterdhavian families that had similar interests in exotic beasts, notably the [[Brokengulf]]s, the [[Gundwynd]]s, and the [[Ilvastarr]]s,{{Cite polyhedron/93/Adversaries|4}} but there were exceptions. Most prominent was the friendship between Urtos II and [[Prendergast Brokengulf]]. The lines were further blurred when Prendergast married Urtos II's young stepmother, Aridarye.",
        "History": "The Phylund family was of [[Tethyrian]] descent and the family was ennobled in the {{YearlinkName|1295}}. until tragedy befell the family in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, when Urtos II and nine other members of a hunting expedition were reportedly killed by a large pack of [[wolves]]. Days later, Urtos I and six beast-wranglers were killed by an [[owlbear]] in the basement of the [[Field of Triumph]], supposedly because the elder Urtos grew careless in his grief and a cage had not been secured properly.{{Cite polyhedron/93/Adversaries|6}} In reality, both accidents were deliberately caused at the behest of Aridarye.{{Cite web enhancement/Dungeon 128 Map and Handout Supplement|9}} She planned to take over the family business by having her son, Urtos III, be named heir and herself as regent.\n\nUrtos II did not die in the wolf attack, but he was afflicted with [[lycanthropy]]. It took him several tendays to learn that he could remain master of himself during the time of the full moon, but could not control the transformation into a [[werewolf]]. Upon hearing news of his father's death, he returned to Waterdeep less than a [[tenday]] after the funeral and claimed his birthright as head of the Phyland clan, much to the shock and vexation of Aridarye. Thereafter, Urtos II spent the nights of the full moon at the Lodge and hid his affliction from everyone with the help of [[Kharkos]], a trusted family butler.\n\n[[File:PhylundVilla.png|thumb|right|270px|''The Phylund family villa (outlined in red), ''circa'' 1492 DR.'']]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1366}},{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|8}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, amid the chaos during the event known has [[Halaster's Higharvestide]], three [[behir]]s appeared in the North Ward not far from the Phylund estate. Lord Urtos II and his beast-tamers captured them in good health with minimal property damage and no loss of life.\n\nEventually, Urtos II's secret was revealed and the family's fortunes waned. All members who were living at the Lodge moved back to the villa on Copper Street as they tried to put uncomfortable events behind them. By the 1480s DR, the Lodge had fallen into disrepair and a [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizard]] [[necromancer]] named [[Thegger Grynn]] had moved in and began experimenting on the contents of the Phylund family crypts.\n\nBy the midâ€“1490s DR, the Phylunds were still in business and still sponsoring groups of [[adventurer]]s to hunt and capture beasts for their monster mill.",
