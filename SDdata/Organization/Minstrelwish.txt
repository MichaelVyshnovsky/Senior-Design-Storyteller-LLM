Minstrelwish was one of the most famous and numerous of hin clans as of the 14 century DR, generously spread out across the entirety of Faerûn.
The Minstrelwish family held a noble title in the city of Ravens Bluff. The family was led by a Baron (traditional hin title – Auldoan), its members were numerous, and the family counted at least nine active family branches as of the 14 century DR. The clan had a reputation cheerful, happy-go-lucky, but tieless and industrious workers. Many Minstrelwishes thought the noble status nothing more than a joke, considering themselves simple folk. Their wealth was built through hard work and wise business diversification. 
Unlike many other noble families, the Minstrelwish clan had no mercenary armies, no council seats, or major land holdings. Most of the family wealth was invested into restoring and rebuilding homes, renting them out for fair prices with live-in Minstrelwish landlords, various shipping and courier services, employing other halflings, gnomes, and humans, art dealerships, foods, and selling everyday necessities. Low-profile landlords and real estate merchants of the Minstrelwish clan inhabited Arrabar, Baldurs Gate, Beluir, Berdusk, Crimmor, Derlusk, Everlund, Luthcheq, Saerloon, Scornubel, Sheirtalar, Shoun, Silverymoon, Tarmalune, Tharsult, Waterdeep, Yhaunn, and Zazesspur.
Apart from mercantile activities, the Minstrelwish clan was considered the most influential hin family in regards of art, music, fiction writing, and even in the lucrative windchime industry. They existed for several thousands of years as of the 14 century DR.
As of the late 14 century DR, the Minstrelwish family was the only noble halfling clan in Ravens Bluff. There, the clan owned numerous cobbler shops, laundry, and cleaning services. The familys estate – Whitegates, stood on the crossing of the Moorland Ride and Dragonscale Street in Ravens Bluff.
The Moon Mountain Brewery on the Unicorn Run was run and served as home to two prominent hin families Borulglar and the Minstrelwish. Together, both clans numbered 18 adults and 7 kids who operated the business in the late 14 century DR. The families collected lumber from the High Forest to craft barrels, farmed brewing fruit, grains, and vegetables, all resulted in rum and moonslake.
The volcanic ice of Arnrock a the center of the Lake of Steam was home to members of Minstrelwish, Brolluck, and Rauligar halfling clans, collectively known as the Arn. They used volcanic heat to produce copper.
Beyond the world of Toril, Minstrelwishes were present on the worlds of Mystara and even Earth.
Over the centuries, Minstrelwish halflings showed interest in planal travel and used it to trade across many worlds. This use of magic attracted the attention of various Chosen of Mystra. By the 14 century DR, wizardly Minstrelwishes were considered useful allies to the Seven Sisters, Elminster, and Khelben Arunsun.
