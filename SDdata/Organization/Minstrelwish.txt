'''Minstrelwish''' was one of the most famous and numerous of [[hin]] clans as of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]],{{Cite dragon/269/The New Adventures of Volo: Hin Nobody Knows|84}} generously spread out across the entirety of [[Faerûn]].

==Organization==
The Minstrelwish family held a noble title in the city of Ravens Bluff. The family was led by a Baron (traditional hin title – ''Auldoan''), its members were numerous, and the family counted at least nine active family branches as of the 14{{th}} century DR. The clan had a reputation cheerful, happy-go-lucky, but tieless and industrious workers. Many Minstrelwishes thought the noble status nothing more than a joke, considering themselves simple folk. Their wealth was built through hard work and wise business diversification. 

Unlike many other noble families, the Minstrelwish clan had no mercenary armies, no council seats, or major land holdings. Most of the family wealth was invested into restoring and rebuilding homes, renting them out for fair prices with live-in Minstrelwish landlords, various shipping and courier services, employing other halflings, [[gnome]]s, and [[human]]s, art dealerships, foods, and selling everyday necessities. Low-profile landlords and real estate merchants of the Minstrelwish clan inhabited [[Arrabar]], [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Beluir]], [[Berdusk]], [[Crimmor]], [[Derlusk]], [[Everlund]], [[Luthcheq]], [[Saerloon]], [[Scornubel]], [[Sheirtalar]], [[Shoun]], [[Silverymoon]], [[Tarmalune]], [[Tharsult]], [[Waterdeep]], [[Yhaunn]], and [[Zazesspur]].

Apart from mercantile activities, the Minstrelwish clan was considered the most influential hin family in regards of art, music, fiction writing, and even in the lucrative windchime industry. They existed for several thousands of years as of the 14{{th}} century DR.

==Base of Operations==
As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Minstrelwish family was the only noble halfling clan in Ravens Bluff. There, the clan owned numerous cobbler shops, laundry, and cleaning services. The family's estate – [[Whitegates]], stood on the crossing of the [[Moorland Ride]] and [[Dragonscale Street]] in Ravens Bluff.

The [[Moon Mountain Brewery]] on the [[Unicorn Run]] was run and served as home to two prominent hin families: [[Borulglar]] and the Minstrelwish. Together, both clans numbered 18 adults and 7 kids who operated the business in the late 14{{th}} century DR. The families collected lumber from the [[High Forest]] to craft barrels, farmed brewing fruit, grains, and vegetables, all resulted in [[rum]] and [[moonslake]].{{Cite dragon/299/Elminster's Guide to the Realms: Moon Mountain Brewery|80-81}}

The volcanic ice of [[Arnrock]] a the center of the [[Lake of Steam]] was home to members of Minstrelwish, [[Brolluck]], and [[Rauligar]] halfling clans, collectively known as the [[Arn]]. They used volcanic heat to produce [[copper]].

Beyond the world of [[Toril]], Minstrelwishes were present on the worlds of [[Mystara]] and even [[Earth]].{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-02-26 - The Minstrelwish Family}}

==History==
Over the centuries, Minstrelwish halflings showed interest in planal travel and used it to trade across many worlds. This use of magic attracted the attention of various [[Chosen of Mystra]]. By the 14{{th}} century DR, wizardly Minstrelwishes were considered useful allies to the [[Seven Sisters]], [[Elminster]], and [[Khelben Arunsun]].

By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the family's patriarch was at least 121-year-old Baron [[Obelarth Minstrelwish|Obelarth "Oldwrinkles" Minstrelwish]] of Ravens Bluff. He built his wealth via the business of making [[spectacle]]s, [[spyglasses]], and other lenses. His elected successor was Lady [[Kassandra Minstrelwish]], a member of the [[Knights of the Hawk]] and the Deputy Guildmaster of the [[Silent Network]]. She was wed to [[Harold Pierre]], the owner of the [[Crescent Moon (inn)|Crescent Moon Inn]] shortly before 1370 DR.

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the most renowned far-traveling Minstrelwishes were [[Anathraea Minstrelwish|Anathraea]], [[Claretta Minstrelwish|Claretta]], [[Nintarra Minstrelwish|Nintarra]], and [[Yaunsae Minstrelwish]], while the clan's ''Auldoan'' of the time was [[Duroavran Minstrelwish]], who, in turn, was guided by his older Matriarch cousins [[Breteenra Minstrelwish|Breteenra]], [[Maevurla Minstrelwish|Maevurla]], and [[Zarettara Minstrelwish|Zarettara]].
