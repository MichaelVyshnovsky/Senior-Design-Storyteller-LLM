When there were suitable jobs, they made their living as sellswords. However, when honest work was unavailable, they turned to criminal activities, resorting to brigandry and thievery.",
        "History": "The group tried to steal the presumed treasure hoard of the young [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]] from its lair, [[Icespire Hold]]. They waited for the dragon to leave its lair so they could raid it in its absence. However, Cryovain hadn't amassed any treasure yet.",
