The Order of the Unicorn was a group of former adventurers who turned to Lurue and spread her influence across Faerûn.
The Order was composed of many smaller groups which separated from the Knights of the Unicorn following the Time of Troubles in order to do good deeds over a larger area. They referred to this as "chasing the unicorn." Each separate group within the Order of the Unicorn was commanded by one of the original members of the Knights of the Unicorn who were visited by Lurue and her Silver Herd outside of the elven castle of Ellahana Raikeil.
The commanders of the Order as of the mid–14 century DR were
* Javalar Roaringhorn
* Iallanara Moondust
* Plomdar the Bombastic
* Balanta Whiteshield
* Ventar Halfhuman
* Penegala Sashenstar
* Jolboss "Stoutguts" Twylar
