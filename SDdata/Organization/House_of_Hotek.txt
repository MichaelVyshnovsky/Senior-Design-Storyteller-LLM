The House of Hotek was a smaller tribe of enlightened Al-Badia within the Haunted Lands around 1367 DR who were intent on disrupting the city of Hiyal.
This tribe traditionally roamed the northwest region of the Haunted Lands.
The sheikh of the Hotek preached against Hiyal and its Sultana, causing the tribes ranks to swell beyond their previous count of 2,000 members. Many smaller clans hurt or oppressed by the Sultana flocked to the House of Hoteks side.
The increased raiding done by the House of Hotek begun to bring them into conflict with the House of Hanif who, as loyal servants to the Grand Caliph and his vassals, were honor-bound to protect Hiyal.
Sheikh Ibrin ruled the tribe in 1367 DR.
