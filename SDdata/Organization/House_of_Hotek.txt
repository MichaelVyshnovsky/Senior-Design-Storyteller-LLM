The '''House of Hotek''' was a smaller tribe of [[Zakharan pantheon|enlightened]] [[Al-Badia]] within the [[Haunted Lands]] around [[1367 DR]] who were intent on disrupting the city of [[Hiyal]].{{AQ-time}}<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p43-44">

==Base of Operations==
This tribe traditionally roamed the northwest region of the Haunted Lands.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p43-44"/>

==Activities==
The sheikh of the Hotek preached against Hiyal and its [[Alurah bint Asrah|Sultana]], causing the tribe's ranks to swell beyond their previous count of 2,000 members. Many smaller clans hurt or oppressed by the Sultana flocked to the House of Hotek's side.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p43-44"/>

The increased raiding done by the House of Hotek begun to bring them into conflict with the [[House of Hanif]] who, as loyal servants to the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] and his vassals, were honor-bound to protect Hiyal.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p43-44"/>

==Members==
Sheikh [[Ibrin]] ruled the tribe in 1367 DR.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p43-44"/>
