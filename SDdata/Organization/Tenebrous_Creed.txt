The '''Tenebrous Creed''', previously known as the '''Black Ice''', was a sect of [[Shar]]-worshipers that devoted themselves to releasing the [[elder evil]] [[Father Llymic]] from imprisonment within the [[Thunder Peaks]] mountain range.{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|3}}

{{Quote|From afar he comes. Here the sunlight succumbs. Shadows will overwhelm. As frost embraces the realm. For Shar. For Shar.|The ''Tenebrous Creed''.}}

==Activities==
The Tenebrous Creed sought to unleash the [[evil]] of the entombed Father Lymic to bring more glory in [[Shar]]'s name. Yet others within the group wanted to transform into immortal, crystalline versions of their own selves.

==Base of Operations==
The group set up a base camp in the Thunder Peaks near Father Lymic's frozen, mountaintop prison.

==Possessions==
Unlike other Sharran sects, apostles of the Tenebrous Creed wore bright yellow robes.{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|19}}

==History==
The sect's history dates back to when Father Lymic was brought to the Realms from the [[Far Realm]] by [[elves]] from [[Myth Drannor]]. On that occasion some followers of Shar received a prophetic tenet that was subsequently passed down in the centuries that followed. This came to be known as the ''Tenebrous Creed'', from which the organization took its name.{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|10}}

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Tenebrous Creed managed to access the [[Supreme Forge]] beneath the lost [[Abeir]]an city of [[Xorvintroth]].{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|16}} 

During their expedition they uncovered the artifact known as the ''[[Gauntlet of One]]'',{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|12}} tapped into the memories of dead [[dragonborn]] to learn more secrets about the Far Realm,{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|17}} and inadvertently let loose some Far Realm energy within one of the forge's workshops.{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|18}} The leaders of the sect even managed to briefly bring forth an aspect of Father Lymic by means of an improvised ''[[portal]]'' to the Far Realm,{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|20}} but were thwarted by a band of [[adventurer]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/Expedition to the Supreme Forge|21}}
