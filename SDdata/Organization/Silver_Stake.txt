'''The Silver Stake''' was a [[lycanthrope]]-hunting organization based in a compound on the outskirts of [[Baldur's Gate]].{{Cite web/The Search for the Circle of Vehlarr/Part Two}}

==Members==
The Silver Stake numbered between twenty and thirty, and attempted to capture and cure lycanthropes in the [[Western Heartlands]]. The organization was led by [[Karel Mahorne]], an elderly priestess of [[Mielikki]].

Many of the Silver Stake's members were those who lost loved ones to lycanthropy and wanted to make a difference. These were mainly [[ranger]]s, [[fighter]]s, and [[cleric]]s, though membership was open to anyone of [[good]] alignment who shared the organization's goals. The clerics in the organization venerated Mielikki out of respect for Karel, but many actually worshiped [[Sel没ne]]. All members had at least one [[magic]]ally enhanced [[weapon]] and one [[silver]] weapon.

==Base==
Their compound consisted of a shrine to Mielikki and a collection of lore on lycanthropy and its cures. It was manned by two acolytes, a priestess of Sel没ne, and guarded by a few men-at-arms.

==Gas bombs==

The Silver Stake employed explosive devices packed with allergy-inducing materials that could weaken lycanthropes so that they could be successfully captured. They were effective to about {{SI|15|ft}} and each member usually carried up to four of them.{{Cite web/The Search for the Circle of Vehlarr/Part Three}}
