The Silver Stake was a lycanthrope-hunting organization based in a compound on the outskirts of Baldurs Gate.
The Silver Stake numbered between twenty and thirty, and attempted to capture and cure lycanthropes in the Western Heartlands. The organization was led by Karel Mahorne, an elderly priestess of Mielikki.
Many of the Silver Stakes members were those who lost loved ones to lycanthropy and wanted to make a difference. These were mainly rangers, fighters, and clerics, though membership was open to anyone of good alignment who shared the organizations goals. The clerics in the organization venerated Mielikki out of respect for Karel, but many actually worshiped Sel没ne. All members had at least one magically enhanced weapon and one silver weapon.
Their compound consisted of a shrine to Mielikki and a collection of lore on lycanthropy and its cures. It was manned by two acolytes, a priestess of Sel没ne, and guarded by a few men-at-arms.
The Silver Stake employed explosive devices packed with allergy-inducing materials that could weaken lycanthropes so that they could be successfully captured. They were effective to about  and each member usually carried up to four of them.
