        "mainbody": "The church of Mielikki (\nAlthough it had a similar ethos to the church of Silvanus, whom the Forest Queen served, the church of Mielikki emphasized the positive and beneficial aspects of the wilderness. and that people could enjoy the fruits of nature without excesses or exploitation. Moreover, they desired to live in full harmony with nature, and not by becoming beasts themselves but by being conscientious stewards of the wilderness and friends to all beasts.\nHence, the Walkers of the Forest Way were taught that the ways of the wild were the ways of good, and they should not fear the wild but rather welcome and embrace it. They were to learn the hidden ways of all life maintain the balance of natural cycles and of wilderness and civilization, and protect forests and nature in general against the forces of ignorance and evil, of which ignorance was the more damaging, and act not just for the good of the natural world, but the world as a whole. They also saw complete freedom as the natural state, reasoning that as animals would go where they willed, then so should people.\nIn particular, Mielikkians were asked to protect the life of the forest and defend every tree. They were invited to dwell within the forest and be a part of it and be at peace with it, rather than exist in lasting conflict with it. They should not let trees be cut down without purpose or let fires spread, and when a tree was felled by disease, logging, or fire, they should plant another to maintain their numbers and the balance. Moreover, they should disrupt and even punish people who hunted only for sport and were cruel to wild animals. But Mielikkians must also encourage others to respect and love forest life rather than fear it and teach them the ways of the forest and how to live in harmony with it too. However, they were not to push their ways on others, but to help and lead by example.\nBy and large, Forestarms were practical folk who were disinterested in fuss and had little time for overmuch ceremony, yet they were reverent in their prayers by the campfire. Both Needles and Forestarms alike were apt to be the most adventurous of those who lived in the wilds, and tended to be easygoing by nature. They were serene in their understanding of the natural balance.\nInitially, the Walkers of the Forest Way were composed almost entirely of clerics. They had little-to-no formal hierarchy, with senior clergy simply assembling networks of allies who could gather and disseminate information and would work together to realize the churchs goals. Rangers who were members of the church or who were in direct service to it were a laity treated as an auxiliary force or adventuring division that could be set against enemies of the faith. Perhaps surprisingly, there were no druids at all by 1358 DR, but the church was on good terms with them.\nThen, in 1369 DR, to halt the decline of her faith, Mielikki herself called for the church to be restructured. Druids were reintroduced and either joined the clerics as part of the new hierarchy (though they were still few in number in the years immediately after) or else established druid circles of their own dedicated to Mielikki in the North. In the new church, there were three great branches the Heartwoods, the Arms of the Forest, and the Needles.\nHeartwoods\nComprising dryads, hamadryads, and treants, these beings served as the voices of the spirits of the very trees and were considered the heart of the church.\nArms of the Forest\nAlso called the Forestarms, or simply Arms, and made up of the clerics and druids, this was the main body of the priesthood and its spiritual center. They were dedicated to protecting the forests. It was open to all humans, demihumans, and woodland beings of good and neutral character, but the majority were human and half-elf women who displayed a passion for their work, combat prowess, and adventuring habits.\nNeedles\nThese were the rangers of the church. They usually acted as a militant order that defended the forests against the churchs enemies, but they could also act as priests themselves. Far from the lowliest, they were believed to be most beloved by Mielikki, the Supreme Ranger.\nMembers of the church were officially called the Walkers of the Forest Way, which was also the adjective for the faith. Circa 1479 DR, the priesthood was commonly called \"druids\".\nAmong the Forestarms, titles were simple and few. The novices were called Questers, junior priests hadnt yet seen two winters in service were Spring Stags, and regular priests with experience but no significant achievements or temple duties were Stalkers in the Green. In the higher ranks, senior temple staff, emissaries, and recognized teachers of the faith were all Forest Flames. Among temple staff, titles were straightforward, such as Cook, Doorwarden, Housemaster, Worship Master, Master of Novices, Prior, and Abbot. At the highest levels, temple leaders and champions of the church were titled High Rangers. The goddess herself bestowed the title Hawk of the Lady on her most valued and highest-ranked faithful.\nthumb|left|250px|A woodscout combined the skills of a cleric and a ranger.\nThe restructured church of Mielikki included clerics and druids (both called Forestarms) and rangers (termed Needles). Similarly, crusaders of the faith were trained in tracking but could not turn undead and the unique woodscouts merged priest and ranger skills. In the late 1400s, the church could also include wardens and the favored of Mielikki.\nWithin each of the branches were a number of distinct religious orders. Some of the most notable were\n* Order of the Unicorns Horn A small society of wandering healers who aimed to bring peace to injured people, animals, and plants.\n* Shadoweirs Part of the Needles, this was a religious knighthood of the woods made up of half-elf druid/rangers. They were activists who proselytized with zeal and would go on the offensive to save their sacred forests.\n* Circle of the Stag A druid circle of the High Forest who held the ceremony for selection of the Green Regent, one of the Chosen of Mielikki.\n* Treespeakers, all graceful elf maidens who ride unicorns\n* The Druids of Tall Trees, a band of druids devoted to Mielikki, Eldath, and Silvanus who take care of the Tall Trees region of the High Forest.\nThe Walkers of the Forest Way worked to both renew the remaining woodlands and grow them further and to help forest life flourish. This work was primarily undertaken by the Forestarms, with support from the Needles and the churches of Eldath and Silvanus. In an ongoing effort, all members collected seeds of trees and forest vegetation, planted them, and nurtured them, with the goal that forty new trees grow for every one claimed by logging or fire. In various hidden valleys, the Forestarms kept nurseries of seedlings of all kinds of forest plants and deep in the forests they protected wildlife preserves where rare beasts bred and thrived undisrupted by the outside world. Pragmatically minded, however, Forestarms also negotiated or manipulated local leaders into logging only dying or deceased trees in one area so they would leave a recovering area elsewhere untouched. They also tried to eliminate blights, both natural and unnatural. Their goal was to keep the forest healthy overall.\nTo try to halt further advances of civilization into the forests and the loss of habitats, the Forestarms taught folk to respect and care for the woodlands. They encouraged both urban and rural folk to revere nature and see local woodlands not as dangerous wildernesses to be feared and battled, but as safe and pleasant places where they could appreciate natural beauty and find refuge and renewal. Forestarms were usually found visiting small settlements located along the forest fringes, teaching people there love for the woods and the skills of good forest husbandry. Both Forestarms and Needles met with foresters periodically to provide healing and advice to limit the number of trees they cut and to hunt weaker and older animals rather than healthy young ones and to cull unnatural predators. They also worked with and assisted all rangers, no matter their faith, however they could. Around the Realms, it was advised that hunters, loggers, and homesteaders looking to clear land or expand settlements first consult with the churches of Mielikki, Eldath, Silvanus, or others, or rangers or druids of them, and work with them and local druid circles, rather than against them.\nBut when they must, both Forestarms and Needles would fight to defend the forests as well. They would drive out or slay creatures of evil who trespassed in the forest and opposed practitioners of fire magic, such as Red Wizards and the faithful of Kossuth, for its threat to forests, though this was secondary to their primary goals. The savage leucrotta was one unnatural beast they believed should be hunted and slain on sight. But most of all, Mielikkians were outraged by the hunting of unicorns to claim their horns, and would go so far as to execute those convicted of committing such vile deeds.\nBy habit and by preference, both Forestarms and Needles tended to live within the forests. They usually maintained two or more dwellings and at least a dozen caches of food and supplies, which they could journey to when required. The Heartwoods, of course, lived in the forests by their very nature.\nTo venerate the Forest Queen, one of the faithful needed only to spend some time in meditation and introspection in both the morning and evening, and do so under a forests branches if possible. Afterward, they listened to the whispers of the woods and tried to interpret their meaning,  for they believed the goddess to most often manifest her voice as a whisper in the rustling of leaves, echoing forever through all the forests of the world, and that a good and faithful worshiper could comprehend them. Otherwise, the particulars of worship differed from person to person. Many of the rangers of the North prayed to Gwaeron Windstrom instead, rather than Mielikki herself, worrying that she was too divine, wild, primal, and mysterious to be beseeched directly, while Gwaeron at least was once a mortal ranger like them. Divine spellcasters following Mielikki could pray for spells in either the morning or evening, but were required to observe both events. \nAt other times, when beseeching the goddess for aid or a blessing in a simple task such as treating an injured animal or following a trail, Mielikkians simply asked her under their breath for going ahead. When choosing to undertake a quest to right some wrong done to the woods, a Mielikkian would make a special prayer asking for guidance and strength. On special occasions, groups of them would assemble under the stars, to sing and praise the Lady of the Forest and call her to guide them.\nWhen lighting a fire, Mielikkian priests were required to whisper the Dread Prayer over it. Then, by the goddesss grace, it produced intense heat in so only selected directions, but very little smoke and only dim light. Thus, it drew little attention and could not spread, eliminating the risk of forest fires, so the Mielikkian need not watch the fire.\nOnce a month, if not more often, all of the Walkers of the Forest Way were required to perform a ritual titled the Song of Trees, which called forth a dryad, hamadryad, or treant, and to perform various small deeds for it for a day.Though not specified, it seems likely these creatures are of the Heartwoods branch of the church. Mielikki shielded the faithful from the dryads charms. \nMielikkians also held the equinoxes and solstices as holy days, called the Four Feasts, with the simple titles of First Feast, Second Feast, Third Feast, and of course Fourth Feast. Most familiar to those outside the faith but held deep in the woods, these were times of sacred rituals, songs of praise to the Forest Queen, and revels for celebration of the sensual side of life.\nThe common festival days of Greengrass and Midsummer Night were similar to the Four Feasts but greater in scale, with additional planting rites and the grand Wild Ride. On these occasions, Mielikki brought unicorns together in herds that raced through the woods at a gallop. Walkers of the Forest Way were even allowed to mount these unicorns and ride them bareback all through the night. Mielikki also empowered the unicorns to teleport as often as they wished and to thrice the usual range, so her followers could be taken incredible distances and see much of the world around them. In the years of Shieldmeet, which occurred after Midsummer, the Wild Ride could continue through that day and night too, if unicorn and rider wished.\nA unique local celebration was the Rite of the Stag Lass, held every year in Amphail on Flamerule 1. It commemorated the death of a local Mielikkian priestess, Asaudrae Daerantree, to hunters while she was in the form of a stag. In it, a Waterdhavian noble maiden dressed in green and wearing a stag headdress made her way to and around town as people threw drinks on her, before she arrived at the Stag-Horned Flagon, where she drank a potent draught, bathed, and was rewarded with gold. After that, drinks were free and the blessed bathwater was used on trees and gardens.\nThe rare emergence of a new oaken defender—once every 1,100 years at a given grove—was a time for both mourning and cheer for the Mielikkians. When a formerly unguarded grove became home to a new young defender, they celebrated the occasion in the festival of Greenhome. They made offerings of food, they prayed to Mielikki, and they performed services for both the dryads and the oaken defender.\nthumb|left|A sketch of the holy symbol of Mielikki.\nThe traditional holy symbol of the faith was a white unicorns head, golden horned and blue eyed, facing sinister, that is, to the left. An alternative symbol showed a white unicorn over a green field. An older symbol was a white star on a green leaf, specifically a tiny and dazzlingly bright white star balanced on a green leaf of oak or ash that was open and verdant. Within the Finnish pantheon, her symbol was an evergreen tree.\nThe Walkers of the Forest Way were spread far and wide and few between. They were not many and rarely came together in a sizeable group for very long. Hence, they rarely established official temples, with most worship held in serene forest glades and glens and at small shrines.\nShrines to Mielikki could be found in wilderness lands all across the North, the Savage Frontier, the Dalelands, and the Western Heartlands, Shrines were often dead tree trunks carved with her holy symbol, or else living trees with a piece of wood bearing the symbol tacked onto it. These often served a dual purpose, as they also marked a limit to logging and hunting in the area—no locals would work beyond the shrine. Such shrines were usually erected by the loggers themselves at the end of an expedition as a sign of gratitude to the Forest Queen for the wood and for their safety.\nTemples to Mielikki were less common than shrinesAgain, though not specified, it seems likely this dryad is of the Heartwoods branch. Small forest creatures were also welcome within the temples and some lived in them permanently.\nSome notable shrines and sacred sites were\n* At the Falls of Tumbling Stars in the Thunder Peaks, a hidden mountain valley was believed sacred to Mielikki and was the most significant place of worship.\n* Gwaerons Slumber, a sacred forest located west of Triboar in the Dessarin Valley. Believed to be where Mielikkis servant Gwaeron Windstrom took his rest, rangers of both gods came here for inspiration.\n* Mielikkis Glade, an open-air glade and college in the center of Silverymoon.\n* The Deep Glade in the Tall Trees, an area of the High Forest considered a stronghold of Mielikkian druids.\n* The Ladys Hands, later the Shrines of Nature, in Waterdeep.\n* The Green Door inn in Essembra, Battledale the shrine was in fact a sacred pool behind it. Pilgrims came here to receive visions.\n* The Dancing Place, a valley in High Dale where Mielikki and other deities once manifested to inspire the formation of the Harpers. Mielikkian priests help tend it as a great garden.\n* A shrine in the village of Mornbryns Shield was one of the most holy to the faith. It marked the tomb of the famed ranger Mornbryn.\n* The headwaters of the Unicorns Run, deep in the High Forest, considered the holiest place to Mielikki.\n* The Moonsilver Inn and the city of Silverymoon, once visited and blessed by both Mielikki and Lurue.\nSee also CategoryShrines to Mielikki and CategoryTemples to Mielikki.\nthumb|A priest of Mielikki in spring ceremonial dress.\nthumb|A pendant holy symbol of Mielikki.\nThe raiment of the Walkers of the Forest Way was governed by the seasons, with each article of clothing having a specific base color and an accent depending on the season. In autumn, it was red with white accents, representing fallen leaves becoming covered with snow. In winter, it was white with green accents, for the evergreen trees under the snow and how the forest remained in full life. In spring, it was green with yellow accents, symbolizing the forest slowly returning to lushness. And finally, in summer, it was yellow with red accents, for the beauty and bounty of flowers, fruits, and grains. Otherwise, the trappings of the faith were often in forest green.\nTheir vestments comprised a plain tunic or tabard, which was typically sleeveless in summer and long-sleeved in winter, together with boots, trousers, and a short cape. All articles of clothing were in the seasonal colors, except the boots, which were always brown. They had no headwear. While working in the woods, most priests wore whatever befitted the weather and the task at hand, but they made an effort to display the seasonal colors, even if in hot weather this might be only a sash and baldric. Needed items were carried in pouches or packs or even strapped to their boots. During times of conflict and adventuring, priests and rangers wore regular armor (often chainmail) with only their capes.\nThey wore their holy symbols of Mielikki always over their hearts, either stitched into the fronts of their tabards with silvery thread or as a pendant carved from bone or ivory.\nWhile within a forest environment, any cleric, druid, or ranger of Mielikki might use a form of the spell analyze balance whenever required. When cast on a type of creature, a specific individual, or an item, it functioned as normal, But if cast on the forest itself, they could detect if the local ecology was significantly threatened.\nA number of spells and prayers were unique to Mielikkian priests or were closely associated with them\n* Banish blight\n* Create treant\n* Find drinkable water\n* Ground trace\n* Stalk\n* Tree healing\n* Unicorn steed\n* Wood sword\nMany spells commonly used by Mielikkians and those that were unique to the church were recorded in Yornars Trail Companion, a holy spellbook that was passed from ranger to priest and from priest to ranger in the Rightful Cycle when Mielikki herself urged the bearers to pass it on. It was thought Mielikki sent the book out to inspire and encourage her faithful and to strengthen the magic of her priests.\nClerics and druids initiated into the higher secrets of the church in the 1370s DR could cast the following unique spells\n* Mold touch\n* Briartangle\n* Thorn spray\n* Fireward\n* Tree healing\nThese they shared with the churches of Silvanus and Eldath. Moreover, they could rebuke or command animals or plant creatures.\nthumb|left|250px|A dwarf favored of Mielikki working magic.\nCirca 1479 DR, a priest of Mielikki could channel divinity and use the divine spell fleetness of Mielikki, becoming blessed with the speed and surefootedness of her sacred white hart.\nJust as Mielikki and Eldath both served Silvanus, members of their respective religions—at least those who put their deitys favor over any personal concerns or conflicts—worked together to achieve their shared goals. Meanwhile, Mielikkis Needles lent aid to Eldathyn and Silvanites alike, and a number of Mielikkian ranger orders maintained close ties to the Church of Silvanus.\nNaturally, Mielikkians had peaceful relations with all the other nature-based deities (with the exception of Malar) and the priests worked closely with rangers in general and had good relations with most druids, even when they werent among the church. In fact, the druids of Faerûn maintained relatively amiable relations between their faiths and deferred to one another in their respective fields of expertise—on matters of forestry and rangers, they consulted Mielikkians.\nAmong common folk in frontier and wilderness lands, the church of Mielikki was viewed favorably for reasons. For one, rangers were usually the only safeguard against the dangers. For another, many believed the priests to be much more open to finding a fair balance between protecting nature and establishing settlements, at least compared to the Silvanites or elves. Finally, they were considered vital to fending off the vicious depredations of the Malarites.\nThe church of Malar was perhaps the greatest foe of the church of Mielikki. They referred to Malar as the Great Beast, the Beast of Beasts, and the Bloodgod. The churches of Mielikki, Silvanus, and Gwaeron Windstrom regularly made expeditions into woodlands to root out and destroy lairs of the People of the Black Blood, a cult of Malarite lycanthropes.\nLastly, while the Harpers were not a part of the church of Mielikki, Those Who Harp had very close ties with the Walkers of the Forest Way. The Harpers opposed all great powers who would try to reshape the Realms, which would perforce threaten the environment. Hence, Mielikkians were obliged to aid the Harpers, at least when it did not interfere or conflict with their main work, and did so especially when their goals aligned.\nWhen the Army of Darkness assaulted Myth Drannor during the Weeping War (711 DR to 714 DR), the church of Mielikki allied with the churches of Selûne, Moradin, Garl Glittergold, and Labelas Enoreth to protect the Temple Ward during the First Sieges. They established a combined army, the Templestars, which was initially victorious in their goals and attracted other faiths under their banner. But in the fall of Myth Drannor, many worshipers of Shaundakul were slain and his faith declined sharply. The church of Mielikki absorbed those Shaundakun rangers who survived, while the church of Waukeen claimed the traders.\nAccording to Mielikkian legend, one dark night in the 10 century DR, Yornar the Tracker was lost in the forest and harried by bugbears when he glanced up at the crescent moon and muttered \"Oh, that the moon itself would come down and light the way for my sword.\" And to his surprise, it did, with a small glowing crescent descending from the heavens and illuminating the forest. As the bugbears cowered, Yornar could see clearly enough to overcome them. Afterward, he gazed up at the crescent and prayed to Mielikki to give thanks, and it came to him in the form of a book of spells that would be known as Yornars Trail Companion. It would be passed between the faithful through the years to come.\nIn the 11 century DR, a priestess of Mielikki that lived in Amphail, Asaudrae Daerantree, was killed by hunters while in the form of a stag, giving rise to the Rite of the Stag Lass. Many of the faith and some in Amphail would come to believe Asaudrae to be Mielikki herself.\nThe Mielikkian temple of Highluthholt in the High Forest was destroyed by a flight of wyverns in the . The wyverns carried off a number of treasures for their unknown master, including Yornars Trail Companion, which remained lost for years.\nYornars Trail Companion resurfaced in , in a bazaar in Murghyr in Murghôm when a mind flayer tried to trade it to Rhighaermon OAntlers, a ranger whod carried it much earlier. Rhighaermon killed the mind flayer and stole back the Companion, and carried it to the Mielikkian temple in Maerlar in Mulhorand. However, he was hunted all the way by the mind flayers druuth and, mortally wounded, collapsed on arrival. An avatar of Mielikki then arrived to slay the doppelgangers and carry Rhighaermon personally to the afterlife. The next day, a message was found on the altar encouraging the Mielikkians to continue the Rightful Cycle of the Companion.\nBut Yornars Trail Companion disappeared for a second time, when its bearer, treespeaker Elanalue Sharrith of the Border Forest was captured by drow and taken into slavery in the . As of 1368 DR, at least six adventuring companies had gone in search of her and the book, the last being the Dwarves of Destiny in Eleint, the . But none had succeeded, or even returned. With the Companion lost, the church of Mielikki could do naught but keep \"an eye out for it\" and try to reclaim it they ever learned of it.\nIn the Dalelands around the 1340s DR, Arms of Mielikki lived, worked, and fought alongside the elves there. As the elven population was so small and slow to replenish, they relied on the human Mielikkians to protect them, calling them as \"our shields\". This established a deep and long-lasting trusting between the church of Mielikki and the Dales elves.\nWhen the gods were cast down to the mortal world during the Time of Troubles in the , Mielikki suffered little, but having so many stray other gods wandering the world gave her faithful no end of grief.\nIn the latter half of the 1360s DR, a few Forestarms started buying up land around Secomber in the Western Heartlands and in upcountry Sembia, using riches retrieved from hidden caches and ruins in some forests. On these lands, they established orderly tree plantations that would serve as \"forest shields\" to supply local peoples with lumber before they looked to natural woodlands. The Arms would even cut the wood themselves and sell it cheap. They later extended this scheme to parts of Amn and Tethyr. To aid this practice, the Forestarms hired foreign adventuring companies, nicknamed \"armies of the trees\", to combat any woodcutters who still targeted the natural woodlands. Other Forestarms and Needles worked with ranchers in eastern Amn, in the Dessarin Valley, and north of Melvaunt in the Moonsea, having them breed large herds of domestic deer to provide food and pelts, thereby leaving wild forest-dwelling deer free to replenish their numbers. This also allowed other forest creatures to recover, both those preyed on deer and those slain or scared off by humans coming into the forest after them.\nBy the 1360s DR, the church of Mielikki and the goddess herself were in decline. Mielikki came to recognize that, with her service to Silvanus, as his power was growing, her own was dwindling, as were her faithful, which was threatening to reduce her to a demigoddess or less. Finally, in the , Mielikki ordered a complete restructuring of her clergy, creating the branches of the Heartwoods, Forestarms, and Needles and reintroducing the druids. The action not only arrested the decline of her power, but bolstered it and gave her enough to establish her first divine realm in the Outer Planes. Moreover, it both preserved ancient forest traditions and guaranteed the faith would continue to flourish.\n* Hawk of the Lady Neretheen Jalassan at the Falls of Tumbling Stars\n* Vishara, the Arm of Mielikki, a paladin\n* Yornar the Tracker, a ranger and first bearer of Yornars Trail Companion\n* Montolio Debrouchee, the druid who taught Drizzt DoUrden the faith of Mielikki and ranger ways\n* Drizzt DoUrden, a noted drow ranger\n* Lander\n* Pikel Bouldershoulder\n* Florin Falconhand"
