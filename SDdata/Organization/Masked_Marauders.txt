The Masked Marauders were an evil adventuring company in Myth Drannor in 1370 DR.
The four members of the group were
* Gaurldar Ravenhand, the leader
* Ilueth Dragonil, a wizard
* Irlon Shulstarr, a thief and
* Llurella Shulstarr, a thief sister of Irlon.
The Masked Marauders operated in Thay but in 1370 DR they quickly escaped from that country. After a journey through Impiltur and Calaunt, they diverted a ship to Myth Drannor, where they hoped to gain many treasures from the ruins or from other adventurers.
