The Tam family of Thay was nearly as old as the nation itself, and greatly influenced its course of growth and direction throughout the years. Their seat of power was known as the Necropolis.
Since the 11 century DR, the Tam family has overseen operations of the undead servants who moved goods across the long portage. They profited well from transporting shipments arriving from Lake Mulsantir along the River Thay, up the First Escarpment and unloading them on vessels that sailed the waterways atop the Thayan Plateau.
Throughout the familys history in the magocratic nation they have had only three heads of household. The most recent leader of the family was Szass Tam, who has existed on Toril since the early 12 century.
* Shevas Tam Former head of the family and founder of the long portage.
* Szass Tam Zulkir of necromancy and High Regent.
