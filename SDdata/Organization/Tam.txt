{{otheruses4|the Thayan family|other uses|Tam (disambiguation)}}
The '''Tam''' family of [[Thay]] was nearly as old as the nation itself, and greatly influenced its course of growth and direction throughout the years. Their seat of power was known as [[Necropolis (Thay)|the Necropolis]].

==Activities==
Since the 11{{th}} century [[DR]], the Tam family has overseen operations of the [[undead]] servants who moved goods across the [[long portage]]. They profited well from transporting shipments arriving from [[Lake Mulsantir]] along the [[River Thay]], up the [[First Escarpment]] and unloading them on vessels that sailed the waterways atop the [[Thayan Plateau]].

==History==
Throughout the family's history in the magocratic nation they have had only three heads of household. The most recent leader of the family was [[Szass Tam]], who has existed on [[Toril]] since the early 12{{th}} century.

==Notable members==
* [[Shevas Tam]]: Former head of the family and founder of the long portage.
* [[Szass Tam]]: [[Zulkir]] of [[necromancy]] and High Regent.
