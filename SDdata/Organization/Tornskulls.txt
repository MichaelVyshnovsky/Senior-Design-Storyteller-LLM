The '''Tornskulls''' were an [[orc]] tribe led, in [[1372 DR]], by the trio of [[Koront]], [[Naurorin]], and [[Baerzel]]. 

==Tactics==
The Tornskulls used the tactic of strike first and strike hard. They were much more numerous than neighboring tribes.

The main aim of the Tornskulls was to conquer [[Citadel Felbarr]] and [[Sundabar]]. However, the Tornskulls didn't want to risk their army so they tried every means to convince the [[Red Fangs]] and the [[Heart Takers]] orc tribes to besiege these strongholds instead. The leaders of the Tornskulls were aware that if they had goaded neighboring tribes against the [[Silver Marches]] the situation would have been turned in their favor. Their plan was to conquer the citadels by killing rival orcs when they eventually tired of fighting. During [[1372 DR]], they were still not able to find a way to convince the neighboring tribes to join their war.

==Organization==
The trio of warleaders led almost five thousand well-equipped experienced orcs. Their units were divided into "claws". Each "claw" was formed by eighty orcs led by a veteran leader. Six runner orcs were assigned to each "claw"; their job was to report any suspicious movements of the enemy back to the chief.

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], the Tornskulls had settled a permanent garrison of a "claw" to keep away anyone trying to cross the pass. Warleader Koront hoped that blocking the path would induce the Silver Marches to set up a messy expedition through the Rauvin Mountains to clear the way.

If the orcs noticed any enemies approaching the pass, they sounded the alarm with torches and horns. The claw of Vaug had also at their disposal many [[goblin]] slaves, which would have done any dirty work.

==Religion==
The orcs were [[Gruumsh]] worshipers. They made tremendous sacrifices on the [[Old Skull Altar]] in the name of Gruumsh. Before suffering the victims were stripped. On the Old Skull Altar were laid various relics, which nobody touched since it was Gruumsh's will. [[Puchk|Old Puchk]] and his adepts resided in the [[Shrine of Gruumsh]], a small rough cavern lit by smoking braziers.
