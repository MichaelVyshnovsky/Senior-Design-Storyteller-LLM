The '''Dao Khanate''' was the collective term referring to the ruling body of government of the [[dao]].
 
==Organization==
The Great Khan, [[Kabril Ali al-Sara al-Zalazil]], ruled over all of the [[noble dao]] comprising the Dao Khanate.

==Activities==
The Great Khan's favor was based upon industry and production, spurring the noble dao to undertake an endless number of mining operations and excursions through the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] in search of precious gems and ore.

The dao did not desire outright conquest of their elemental plane as did some of the other [[genie]]s. They were sorely focused on mining the [[Great Dismal Delve]] for all it was worth.

==Base of Operations==
The [[Sevenfold Mazework]] within the Great Dismal Delve served as the seat of power for the Dao Khanate.
