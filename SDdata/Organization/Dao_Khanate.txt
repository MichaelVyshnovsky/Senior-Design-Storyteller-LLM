The Dao Khanate was the collective term referring to the ruling body of government of the dao.
The Great Khan, Kabril Ali al-Sara al-Zalazil, ruled over all of the noble dao comprising the Dao Khanate.
The Great Khans favor was based upon industry and production, spurring the noble dao to undertake an endless number of mining operations and excursions through the Elemental Plane of Earth in search of precious gems and ore.
The dao did not desire outright conquest of their elemental plane as did some of the other genies. They were sorely focused on mining the Great Dismal Delve for all it was worth.
The Sevenfold Mazework within the Great Dismal Delve served as the seat of power for the Dao Khanate.
