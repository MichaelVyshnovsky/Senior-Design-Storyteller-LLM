The Conclave of Doom was a council comprising the senior clergy of Myrkul in Faerûn, which operated until the mid–14 century DR. They would oversee the lesser clerics in their service to the Lord of the Dead and instill their doctrine to the churchs initiates. 
They conducted their meetings within the Skullspire, a dreadful tower located in the town of Tulmon on the coast of the Lake of Steam.
