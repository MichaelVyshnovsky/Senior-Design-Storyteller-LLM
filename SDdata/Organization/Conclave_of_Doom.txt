The '''Conclave of Doom''' was a council comprising the senior [[Church of Myrkul|clergy]] of [[Myrkul]] in [[Faerûn]], which operated until the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They would oversee the lesser [[cleric]]s in their service to the Lord of the Dead and instill their doctrine to the church's initiates. 

They conducted their meetings within the [[Skullspire]], a dreadful tower located in the town of [[Tulmon]] on the coast of the [[Lake of Steam]].
