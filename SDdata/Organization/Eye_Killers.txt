The '''Eye Killers''' were a unit of [[orog]] soldiers in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] that fought for Lord [[Vorik Aris]] of [[Cormyr]].

==Description==
The Eye Killers were a well-organized formation of 60 orog soldiers equipped with [[horse]]s, [[splint mail]], [[scimitar]]s, and [[shortbow]]s with [[flight arrow]]s. Their three officers had [[plate mail]] and carried extra [[sheaf arrow]]s, while their chief [[Gribbergrash]] bore some magical equipment.

==History==
The Eye Killers were hired by Lord Aris in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, joining his service alongside the [[Twilight Brigade]], other mercenaries, and various amoral [[adventurer]]s. They were based in [[Wyvernwatch Castle]] and performed scouting and raiding throughout the [[Stonelands]], and Gribbergrash became one of Lord Aris's inner circle of advisors.

When Lord Aris marched on [[Darkenshield]] to begin his military campaign against Cormyr, the Eye Killers rode with him. Unfortunately for the orogs, the first battle they fought was against the combined spirits of Darkenshield's residents and [[Starburst Swords]], and they were destroyed.
