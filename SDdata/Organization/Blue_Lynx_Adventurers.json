        "mainbody": "The '''Blue Lynx Adventurers''' were an adventuring troupe for hire from the [[Sword Coast North]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Blue Lynx Adventurers were hired by [[Lady Jannath]] to search for her missing consort, a painter of some renown, [[Oskar Fevras]]. The group was paid one thousand [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]] for the service and one thousand more in incidentals. The band returned empty-handed, no trace of Oskar was found from [[Baldur's Gate]] to [[Waterdeep]], which was not surprising as he was captured and enslaved by a gang of [[Zhentarim]] smugglers and kept in the [[Zhentarim hideout (Risen Road)|Zhentarim hideout]] underneath [[Waukeen's Rest]] inn in the [[Chionthar Valley]]."
