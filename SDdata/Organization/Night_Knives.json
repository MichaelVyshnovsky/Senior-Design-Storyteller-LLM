        "Organization": "The [[guild]] numbered forty or so members with a mix of [[rogue|thieves]], smugglers, fences and a couple [[wizard]]s and [[cleric|priests]] of [[Mask]].  The Night Knives were known to be infiltrated by both [[Zhentarim]] and [[Harper]] agents.",
        "History": "The guild was destroyed when the [[Krollir Venasten]], the guildmaster and a powerful cleric of Mask, summoned the greater dread [[Yrsillar]] in [[1371 DR]]. [[Drasek Riven]], a lieutenant of the guild and a secret member of the Zhentarim disrupted the circle of protection containing the [[demon]], freeing it. It slew Krollir and possessed his body while he converted the Night Knives into lesser [[shade]]s and [[ghoul]]s."
