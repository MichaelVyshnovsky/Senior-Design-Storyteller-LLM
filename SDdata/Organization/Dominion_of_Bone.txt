The '''Dominion of Bone''' was a small organization of [[undead]] who lived in the ruined fortress of [[Glaur]].

== History ==
In [[1385 DR]], the [[Blue Breath of Change]] happened and destroyed the old fortress of Glaur, transporting [[Laerakond]] from the world of [[Abeir]] to the world of [[Toril]]. Prince [[Nathur Hethkantan]]'s expedition to the fortress was obliterated, but Nathur himself survived as an [[spellscar]]red [[dracolich]]. Unable to leave the section of Glaur known as the Sapphire Vortex, Nathur conquered it and rename it the "Dominion of Bone", killing any creature who entered in his domain to create an army of undead servants.{{Cite dragon/375/Gontal: Dominions of Nehu|83-84}}

== Membership ==
The Dominion of Bone was composed by undead created by Prince Nathur. The oldest among them were a few members of Nathur's original expedition that weren't assimilated into his body, but most members were either [[genasi]] of the [[Dominion of the Burned]] or adventurers who didn't survive their exploration of the Sapphire Vortex. The leader of the Dominion of Bone was Prince Nathur himself, and his most trusted servant was an [[skull lord]] named [[Teshaurus]].
