        "mainbody": "ouse Vandree was the 17th drow house of Menzoberranzan in 1358 DR and therefore one of the minor drow houses in the city. By 1480 DR, it had become the eighth house and thus a member of the Ruling Council.\nHouse Vandree was located in a huge, walled compound south of House DoUrden in the district of West Wall. The compounds main walls extended outwards (to the east) from the wall, appearing almost like a prow.\nThe members of House Vandree were very interested in Surface affairs and frequently collected trophies from the Surface, from leaves to human skulls.\nA tragic fate came upon one of the daughters of House Vandree around the year 1322. Sosdrielle Vandree became one of the latest liaisons of the archmage Gromph Baenre and gave birth to his daughter Liriel. When Gromph realized her talent for magic, he arranged the death of her mother Sosdrielle as an accident and took his daughter into House Baenre.\nAround 1357 DR, Dinin DoUrden spent a year infiltrating House Vandree at the order of Jarlaxle of Bregan Daerthe in preparation for an attack. Dinin was recalled when Jarlaxle found a more interesting opportunity with Vierna DoUrden and her lust for Drizzt DoUrden.\nShortly after the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR, when the house ranked seventeenth,\nHouse Vandree was in a most precarious situation around 1368 DR. Their numbers were few but their compound grand. Their neighboors of House Barrison DelArmgo had made it known that they coveted the Vandree compound. For this reason Matron Trokenther Vandree tried either to win the protection of House Baenre, or get Yvonnel Baenre to demand a civilized swap of the compounds. But the old Baenre hesitated to do so. On the one hand there had been too much chaos in the recent past among the leading houses, but on the other hand, Yvonell was eager to see Barrison DelArmgo get into a fight and show what they could do. But there was a spark of hope for House Vandree they had a long-standing tradition of getting into trouble and somehow finding a way out. Trokenther and her offspring seemed to delight in internal feuding and dangerous political ploys. House Vandree even dabbled in surface-world affairs, acquiring all sorts of trophies and useful magical items. There were rumors that human skulls, fashioned into drinking goblets, were their favorites.\nHouse Vandree fell to the position of the twentieth house by 1372 DR.\nBy 1480 DR, House Vandree rose quickly to become the eighth house and thus a member of the Ruling Council.\nSometime before the late 15 century DR, a High Priestess from House Vandree became involved with then-young Minthara Baenre. The women remained lovers for some time until Minthara received an order to end the High Priestess. Minthara poisoned her lover and stayed at her side, whispering words of comfort until the priestess died.\n Alton Vandree  One of the missing males who disappeared in 1372 DR to join the illthilich Syrzans revolt against the citys priestesses.\n Fiirnelther Vandree  Daughter and assassin of Trokenther. Current matron mother.\n Liriel Vandree (Liriel Baenre)  Daughter of Sosdrielle Vandree and Gromph Baenre. She was a Vandree until five years of age, when she was taken by her father, who gave her his name in order for her to join House Baenre (although she was raised by House Shobalar.\n Sosdrielle Vandree  Mother of Liriel Baenre one of the most beautiful drow of Menzoberranzan and consort of Gromph Baenre until she was killed by his golem.\n Trokenther Vandree  Former matron mother.\n Asha Vandree  Junior priestess stationed at Velkynvelve."
