The '''Scoured Legion''' (also known as the '''Scourged Legion''') of [[Hellgate Keep]] was a strong company of [[tanarukk]]s. 

==Leadership==
The Scoured Legion was led by [[Kaanyr Vhok]], a [[cambion]] who proclaimed himself "the Sceptered One and Master of the Scoured Legions." 

==Members==
Vhok's Scoured Legion consisted of 2,000 tanarukk warriors with auxiliary troops: bugbears, ogres, giants, etc. They had their own forges and armories.

Vhok lost 120 tanarukks in the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]].

==Base==
The Scoured Legion was originally based in [[Hellgate Keep]]. After the fall of the keep, they settled in [[Ammarindar]], where they remained until [[1372 DR]]. After the failed Siege of Menzoberranzan in [[1373 DR]], they returned to Hellgate Keep.

==History==
The Scoured Legion invaded the [[Nameless Dungeon]] in Alturiak [[1369 DR]], opposed by a band of snakelike creatures. 

In [[1372 DR]] to [[1373 DR]] they participated in the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]] alongside the [[duergar]] army of [[Gracklstugh]] with the support of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]], but withdrew just as the tide of battle turned against them, leaving their allies to be decimated. Vhok subsequently removed his headquarters to [[Hellgate Keep]].

Later in the year they besieged [[Sundabar]] but were again repelled. [[Kaanyr Vhok]] and his consort [[Aliisza]], fled for the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] through a ''portal'' beneath the city, leaving the Legion fractured.
