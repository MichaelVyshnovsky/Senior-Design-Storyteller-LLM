The League Conclave was the governing body of the Pantheist League in the Cities of the Pantheon region of interior Zakhara in 1367 DR.
In addition to normal duties of government, the Conclave guided and enforced the pure moralist teachings of Pantheist Enlightenment throughout the Pantheist League.
The League Conclave was based in Itiraf which was the capital of the Pantheist League. The building housing the Conclave here was second in size and grandeur within the Cities of the Pantheon only to the Great Mosque of the Pantheon. The Conclave maintained satellite locations in all of the major cities of the region.
