        "History": "Clan Nornglast was one of the most prominent clans of Eskorn, and its members were the founders of the \"Royal Keep\" of the [[Nornglast|same name]]. They had an incredibly fabulous wealth but expended most of it in a secret project nobody knew about it. Eskornar commoners called it the \"Nornglast Secret\", as a way to say that the Nornglast were different to other nobles but nobody knew how.\n\nClan Nornglast disappeared many years before the [[Spellplague]]."
