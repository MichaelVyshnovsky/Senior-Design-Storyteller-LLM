==Headquarters==
While the Brotherhood did take up residence in the Icespear House for a time, their inner sanctum was hidden beneath a [[magic]]ally sealed slab on the manor's stone floor.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Shades of Blue Fire|21}}

==History==
Shortly before the [[Spellplague]] of 1385 DR, the Brotherhood settled into the town of Deadsnows and wound up taking residence within the Icespear House. From there, they began patrolling the region in order to defend it from the malevolent raiders of the [[Nether Mountains]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Shades of Blue Fire|7}}

The brotherhood began to garner some considerable wealth from their exploits. When the [[blue fire]] came upon the Icespear House once again, it quickly killed many within the group. Those few that survived were forced to abandon their cache of riches and [[magic]] items,{{Cite organized play/LFR/Shades of Blue Fire|21}}
