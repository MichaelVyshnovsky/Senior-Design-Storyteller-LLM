The Sewn Sisters were a coven of three night hags loyal to Acererak. They were formed sometime in the late 15 century DR.
The coven consisted of three night hags
* Widow Groat, who had tarnished golden coins over her eyes and ants nesting in her skull.
* Peggy Deadbells, who had a necklace made of childrens teeth and was wrapped with gnome skin. Whenever she laughed, yellow gas came out of her ears, mouth, and nose.
* Baggy Nanna, who had a leather sack sewn over her head. Inside the sack were a viper, a cockerel, and a terrier. They would speak for her when needed.
The hags worked with Acererak to nurture and protect the atropal in the Tomb of the Nine Gods until it grew into a death god. They were tempted by all the souls they would obtain.
When adventurers came close to the ruined city of Omu, the hags would haunt their nightmares and steal blood, hair, or other forms of organic matter to clone them. After this, they would interrogate and then eat the clone.
The hags based themselves in the Tomb of the Nine Gods in Omu in Chult.
They owned a scarecrow named Strawbundle made of blood and hair, which held the covens hag eye. They also owned three dolls infused with the souls of dead children. Peggy Deadbells owned a black orb that could be used to exit the tomb once at the end of the tomb.
The Sewn Sisters were one of the few individuals who knew the true name of Mr. Fox, the arcanaloth and guardian of Acereraks library of lore. Only once one of the hags remained living would she reveal Mr. Foxs true name.
