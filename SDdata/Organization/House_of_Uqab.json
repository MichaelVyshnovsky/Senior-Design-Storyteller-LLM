        "mainbody": "The House of Uqab, also called the League of the Vulture, was a tribe of loosely enlightened Al-Badia found in the High Desert of west Zakhara around 1367 DR.\nMade up primarily of 2,500 outcasts of the desert, the House of Uqab considered themselves enlightened, but they held little respect for both the Grand Caliph and the Zakharan gods. Savages and other mountain tribes joined their ranks regularly. These individuals were often used on the front line of any attack to soften the enemy.\nThis tribe survived by raiding caravans and robbing others. They attacked any adventurers in the desert without question.\nSheikh Hanjar al-Haqara ruled the House of Uqab in 1367 DR.\nThe more civilized tribes of the High Desert looked up the House of Uqab with disgust."
