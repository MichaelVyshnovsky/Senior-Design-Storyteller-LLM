            "Ranks": "Like the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]], the City Guard had specific titles for the members of their forces. A City Guard patrol usually consisted of twelve members, whose commanding officer was called the civilar. A commanding officer holding the rank of [[generic City Guard captain (Waterdeep)|captain]] was known as an aumarr, or senior civilar, while one holding the rank of [[generic City Guard lieutenant (Waterdeep)|lieutenant]] was known as a shieldlar, or, simply, civilar. The patrol also contained one armar, or [[Generic City Guard sergeant (Waterdeep)|sergeant]], and ten [[Generic City Guard private (Waterdeep)|guardsmen or guardswomen]], or trusties.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/Ranks of the Waterdeep City Guard and City Watch}} A patrol could also be led by a sergeant.\n\nOther officer positions existed within the ranks of the Guard, not typically associated with regular patrols. In particular, the ranks of valabrar and torsin were responsible for escorting important individuals within the city, while also composing honor guards and bodyguards to diplomats and illustrious visitors to the city. Officers holding those positions outranked captains.\n\n{{Border box float\n| theme        = \n| float        = right\n| contentalign = center\n| width        = 350px\n| styles       = \n| content      = \n{{{!}} cellspacing=0 style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n{{!}}+ style=\"font-size:larger;font-family:Georgia,serif;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;\" {{!}} City Guard Ranks\n{{!}}-\n!

        "Activities": "The City Guard's duty was to investigate foreign threats to Waterdeep and to protect the city against them.{{Cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/fr/20010516c|title=Waterdeep|author=[[Rob Heinsoo]], [[Ed Greenwood]], [[Sean K Reynolds]]|date=|work=Sneak Peek|publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113084854/http://www.wizards.com:80/default.asp?x=dnd/fr/20010516c |archivedate=2007-11-13|accessdate=2019-03-11}} City Guards could be found posted at [[Castle Waterdeep]], [[Piergeron's Palace]], the city walls, and its surrounding countryside.\n\nCity Guard patrols also kept watch on the roads leading from Waterdeep to [[Amphail (village)|Amphail]], [[Daggerford]], and [[Goldenfields]].",
        "Possessions": "Around [[1357]] and [[1358 DR]], soldiers of the City Guard wore yellow [[scale armor]] under green cloaks and [[tabard]]s. They wore matching conical helms of green and gold with fur trim, chainmail neck-guards, and topped by a spike. They could also carry a shield. Both tabard and shield bore the symbol of Waterdeep, a crescent moon reflected over a bay, surrounded by seven stars. They wielded [[longsword]]s, [[dagger]]s, and [[dart]]s coated with a paralytic [[poison]]. On missions outside, they were also armed with [[bow]]s.\n\nBy [[1368 DR]], the standard uniform of the City Guard was silver scale mail under black, gold-trimmed tabards. Standard armament included daggers, [[rod]]s, [[shortbow]]s, and [[shortsword]]s, with the possibility of additional armament for specific assignments.\n\nAround [[1372 DR]], Waterdeep's City Guards wore a uniform of polished [[chainmail]] covered with a tabard in black cloth with gold trim. They carried various weapons as their posts would require, including longswords, shortbows, [[shortspear]]s, shortswords, daggers and [[club]]s.\n\nWhenever Waterdeep reached highs of {{SIrange|80|89|F|long=yes}} in the summer season, the City Guard would dress down from sweltering full body armor into more appropriate protection. This included back and [[breastplate|breast]] plates, [[gorget]]s, metal [[codpiece]]s, and light helms. They would also abstain from wearing [[gauntlet]]s and dress in [[surcoat]]s that were of a white hue in order to minimize heat absorption.<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-05-16 - What the Waterdhavian Guard Wears in the Summer}}",
        "History": "[[File:City_guard_and_magister-5e.jpg|thumb|250px|''Members of the City Guard hold down a suspect while a [[Magister (Waterdeep)|magister]] dispenses judgment.'']]\nOne day in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, a huntsman informed the City Guard of a magical tower erected within a single day, a full day's hard ride north of Waterdeep's [[Trollwall]]. A City Guard patrol, including [[Pern]], investigated and attempted to scale the tower. [[Imgig Zu]], master of the tower, animated his [[gargoyle]] minions to attack the guardsmen.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, when the skies over the city darkened and an interdimensional wormhole (from the [[Great Door]]) disgorged a swarm of [[gargoyle]]s and [[kenku (winged)|kenku]]s over the city, a City Guard troop and [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] arrived to hold them off. {{Cite comic/Day of the Darkening|5}} Shortly after, during the [[Time of Troubles]], members of the City Guard stationed in Castle Waterdeep during a party tried to stop a trio of the [[Dark Army of the Night]] from kidnapping a [[Shar|false avatar]] of [[Selûne]]. However, they were hindered by the Dark Army's utter darkness and then by blinding light. The avatar herself stopped the trio with a ''[[bind]]'' spell, and the City Guard arrested them. Later, Lord [[Piergeiron]] ordered [[Rathnar]] of the City Guard to arrest [[Kyriani]] after she fought with the avatar, but [[Khelben Arunsun]] took charge of the prisoner and let her go.{{Cite comic/Dark of the Moon|11-14,19-20}}\n\nThe 3{{rd}} company of the High Guards fought in the final battle of the [[Second Dragonspear War]] at the [[Dragonspear Castle|castle]] in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}.\n\nWhen the [[Shining Crusade]] threatened the Sword Coast in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, one hundred guardsmen joined the [[Coalition]] army under the command of [[Cedric deLancie|Torsin deLancie]].\n\nAfter the murder of Warden [[Ezender Drayth]] in [[1491 DR]], [[Elminster Aumar]] accepted the position of Warden of Waterdeep, answering directly to [[Open Lord]] [[Laeral Silverhand]]."
