The Emerald Swords were an adventuring company that operated circa 1369 DR. Amoral in the extreme, they worked for Lord Orgauth of Zhentil Keep.
In 1369 DR, the Emerald Swords abducted Lord Partic Thistle at Thistleflame Keep, intending to remove him to Zhentil Keep for interrogation. They had the doppelganger Xixis impersonate Lord Thistle in order to cover their escape, but Xixis acted recklessly and risked exposing their plan. In order to guarantee their success, Gandegar Armstrong had Haridyn Storm assassinate Xixis and left his body as a decoy Lord Thistle. To add further confusion and cover their tracks, they destroyed the official records of the Emerald Swords, Stag Runners, and the Gold Coins adventuring companies. Despite this, the investigation that followed resulted in the Emerald Swords coverup falling to pieces, and Lord Thistle was recovered alive.
As they had killed one of their own number and only kidnapped Lord Thistle, the Emerald Swords may have only been exiled from Cormyr, rather than executed.
