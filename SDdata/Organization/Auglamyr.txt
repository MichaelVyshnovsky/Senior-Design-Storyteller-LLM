Auglamyr was the name of an elven house of Cormanthyr. Their symbol was a multi-headed gold dragon.
The House already existed from long before , when Symrustar Auglamyr was born. Several of its members were involved in the events before the laying of the Mythal of Myth Drannor, including the sisters Holone and Sylmae, who were in service to the Coronal at the time.
Per sages, House Auglamyr survived the Weeping War.
