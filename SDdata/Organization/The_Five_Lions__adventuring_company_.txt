The Five Lions was an adventuring company in the realm of Turmish in the Vilhon Reach in the mid–14 century DR.
They were based at The Five Lions inn in western Turmish. They were founded there and took their name from it.
An adventuring brotherhood, it was led by five retired adventurers.
The group provided training to inexperienced, and aspiring adventurers, usually restless Turmishan youths. They offered instruction in weapons and survival in wilderness and underground environments, though their prices were high. They made use of a number of test dungeons, including an old abandoned tomb, the cellar of a ruined keep, and a mine connected to deeper caverns. It was claimed that drow prowled these caverns, and a deepspawn definitely lived there.
Many of their alumni went to Alaghôn and took work as guards on overland caravans or aboard ships.
During the Ten Black Days of Eleint in the , several members of the royal family escaped Tethyr and somehow made it to The Five Lions inn. However, they were followed by rebels, who killed them in the woods.Polyhedron #98 only says "When strife came to Tethyr..." Its presumed this refers to the triggering event, rather than the following two strife-filled decades of the Tethyrian Interregnum. The history of the Ten Black Days implies all the royal family were killed in the castle fire, but it is known that many nobles escaped to Amn. Thus, it is likely these were royal-related nobles.
These events gave rise to a rumor that, within the cellars of The Five Lions inn, there was a permanent gate of great age that connected to some hidden location in Amn. It was supposed both the fleeing royals and the pursuing rebels had found and gained access to this gate. Moreover, it was suspected by some that the five adventurers who led the group werent fully retired after all.
