        "mainbody": "The '''Red Boar Trading Coster''' was a [[coster]] based in the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was led by [[Deldron Rein]] of the [[Rein]] family.{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/A Fellowship Rises}}",
        "Organization": "For a trading coster, the Red Boars had a significant guardâ€”practically a private army. It was led by Deldron's son, [[Stedd Rein]].\n\nOne of their most preferred caravan captains was [[Geveral Telkku]].<ref>\n\nIts employees wore their own livery.<ref>",
        "Activities": "The Rein family owned a pair of [[coaster]]s that operated between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Baldur's Gate]].<ref>{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/Dispel Confusion Issue 1}}",
        "History": "When his son Stedd returned from the [[College of War]] in [[Athkatla]] in the {{yearlinkName|1369}}, while he was still ''en route'' to Loudwater, Deldron departed the city to greet his son and conduct business in [[Daggerford]], taking the Red Boar Trading Coster's sizeable guard with him. But a magical communication from Loudwater alerted Deldron about a vicious [[lycanthrope]] attack, known as the [[Night of the Blood Moon]], and the Reins and their Red Boar guard hastened to return. Deldron sent Stedd ahead with half his forces while he followed close behind.\n\nStedd and the Red Boar guard arrived in Loudwater on the third day of the conflict, linking with [[Gauntlet (title)|Gauntlets]] [[Kalahar Twohands]] and [[Harazos Thelbrimm]]. Twohands and Thelbrimm divided the city into quadrants for defense by their own armies, the Red Boar guard, and the [[elf|elven]] house guards. Stedd opened the Red Boar's stores and equipped his forces with nearly forty [[alchemical silver]] weapons. Then, on the third night, Stedd Rein rallied his Red Boar forces and charged desperately through the [[Malarites]]' ranks, fighting all the way with silver blades and battle spells, to reach [[Standing Stone Hill]] in an effort to rescue the [[Green Regent]] [[Galaer Grasswave]]. It was a valiant effort, but too far and too hard to be successful. For his courage and leadership, Stedd Rein earned praise and accolades."
