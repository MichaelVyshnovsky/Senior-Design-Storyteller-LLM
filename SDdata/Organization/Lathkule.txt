The '''Lathkules''' were a family of [[Waterdeep]] ennobled in the midâ€“13{{th}} century [[DR]]. They survived through to the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The family business was based around jewelry, prospecting, [[gem]] mining, and gem cutting.

==Possessions==
[[Lathkule Villa]] in the [[North Ward]] was their main residence.{{cite book/Volo's Guide to Waterdeep|239}}

==History==
The family was ennobled in the {{yearlinkName|1248}}.

At some point, the [[Defenders Three]] foiled one of the plots of the patriarch, Nimor Lathkule, against Lord [[Maernos]], a fellow noble.{{Cite dragon/211/"I Sing a Song by the Deep-Water Bay"|34}}

In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], [[Maerjanthra Shalace]]'s jewelry store and workshop was attacked, and its owner apparently slain. Her child, [[Narnra Shalace]], suspected the Lathkule or [[Artemel]] families of having ordered it, though she never found out the truth.

==Members==
As of {{yearlink|1372}}, the Lathkule family boasted 25 official members. At that time, their roster was known to include:
* Patriarch [[Nimor Lathkule]]
* Consort [[Larin Lathkule]]
* Heiress [[Jacinth Lathkule]]
Other known Lathkules of the time period included:
* The adventurer [[Morgunn Lathkule]]{{Cite dragon/227/The Reports from Undermountain|16}}
* [[Korlgan Lathkule]], member of the [[Blacklegs]]{{cite web/Candlekeep Forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2005)/09-21 - Noble Cabals}}

Lathkules of other time periods included:
* [[Shallen Lathkule]], vampire hunter
* [[Yathla Lathkule]], an adventuress around [[1479 DR]].{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/Vraunt of the Masked Princess}}

==Rumors==
The Lathkule family was said to be quite possessive after death, especially to the unlucky living that got too close.{{cite book/City of the Dead||16}}
