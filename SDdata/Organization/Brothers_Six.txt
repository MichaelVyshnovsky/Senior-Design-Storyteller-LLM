The Brothers Six was a group of related mages who wished to control all trade in Calimport some time before the 14 century DR.
As the name implied, six brothers composed the organization.
In order to accomplish their goals the Brother Six went to war with the Nighteyes, a thieves guild whom they believed stood in their way. Though ultimately successful in eliminating their rival, the Brothers Six was reduced to just two surviving brothers by end of the conflict. However, their success was short-lived as Khelben Arunsun stepped in and eliminated the surviving brothers when they tried to expand their influence to Baldurs Gate and Waterdeep.
