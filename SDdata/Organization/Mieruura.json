        "mainbody": "he Mieruura family was one of the twenty families that made up the Onsruur (the hereditary council of lords) in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nThe Mieruura did not have a sharply defining characteristic in their bloodline, but all members had brown or black hair. Suave and polished, they specialized in crafting trade documents to their advantage and negotiating good deals with carefully worded speech. They avoided confrontations, preferring to get all parties to sign a binding agreement.\nThis family was the landlord of some of the largest swaths of Khôltan real estate. They also had properties in Lapaliiya."
