The '''Faerûnian pantheon''' was the most worshiped [[pantheon]] on [[Faerûn]], a continent on [[Toril]].

{{quote|''Now we recall. The slayer of [[Moander]]. A demi-power worshiped only in Abeir-Toril. There are so many gods worshiped in that world it's hard to keep track of them all. We wouldn't be surprised to find they have a god there with dominion over the tableware and ale mugs.''|[[Ilsensine]], on [[Finder Wyvernspur]] and powers of Faerûn}}

==Organization==
===Membership===
The Faerûnian pantheon was a pantheon of [[deities]]. Pantheons were a group of deities who were worshiped by people who shared one characteristic, for example sharing the same cultural or racial background. In the Faerûnian pantheon's case the believers' shared characteristic was a geographic one, people who lived in those parts of the continent Faerûn where other pantheons did not hold sway were the believers.

===Hierarchy===
The [[Circle of Greater Powers]] were the twelve deities that led the pantheon. The leadership was a loose matter and was more of administrative nature. Apart from this, there was little hierarchy in the Faerûnian pantheon except for the one the gods created among themselves. A unique trait of the Faerûnian pantheon was that deities with similar portfolios clustered in a hierarchic relationship.

==Activities==
{{Quote|

Selûne to guide,<br />
Kelemvor to judge,<br />
And passage provide.
|A common Faerûnian household prayer.}}

The Faerûnian pantheon was a very fractious one that fought among themselves and had no overarching goal. This fractious nature was believed to be the source of the pantheon's adaptability and its ability to expand. When it expanded its physical sphere of influence, it usually did so at the expense of other pantheons.

The aforementioned Circle of Greater Powers regulated the deities according to the rules as set by [[Ao]], the [[overgod]] of Toril to whom all pantheons worshiped on Toril were subject to. However, the leaders rarely (if ever) convened to carry out their duties. On the occasions where they did convene they were slow to act, not because of deliberation but because of conflict between each other.

==Tactics==
As mentioned above, the Faerûnian pantheon was a single-sphere pantheon. The reason why gods deliberately concentrated their work on one single world at the exclusion of others was that this way they could shut out deities from other worlds entering and infringing on their home turf.

==Base of Operations==
The Faerûnian pantheon had―as it was normal for single-sphere pantheons―no base of operations. The members held their [[divine realm]]s where it suited them most. The closest to a base of operations was the pavilion of [[Cynosure]], a [[demiplane]] where the Circle of the Greater Powers met.

==Relationships==
As mentioned above, the Faerûnian pantheon was subject to Ao and tried to execute his rule of Balance.

As mentioned above, single-sphere pantheons were good at defending themselves from infringement from potential external rivals. This came at the cost of interplanar unimportance, Toril's deities were, as deities who were worshiped only on a backwater plane like Toril, unimportant deities on the interplanar political landscape. However, the rate at which their importance grew was equal to that of the most vibrant of pantheons. That said, the Faerûnian pantheon ever becoming an important force on the interplanar landscape was considered unlikely at best.

The Faerûnian pantheon as a whole had special relationships with the [[Chultan pantheon]]. The pact between the two was quite simple, [[Ubtao]] would look out for [[Dendar]] while the Faerûnian pantheon would leave Ubtao's turf alone for this service.

==History==
The Faerûnian pantheon was created out of the merging of at least four pantheons, the [[Coramshite pantheon]], the [[Jhaamdathan pantheon]], the [[Netherese pantheon]], and the [[Talfiric pantheon]]. These pantheons were all geographically divided [[human]] pantheons. In ancient times, human pantheons were loosely geographically divided because the humans' population density and area was such that they did not border each other. Over time, the human cultures and borders intermingled with each other and their pantheons intermingled too. When this happened, deities of similar portfolios had to fight each other for supremacy to get rid of the other one. Over time, the pantheons merged together and the Faerûnian pantheon was born. For example, [[Garagos]] and [[Tempus]], both war gods of the Netherese and Talfiric pantheon respectively, fought each other and the former lost. It was not clear when exactly the various pantheons merged into the Faerûnian pantheon. Various gods entered and dropped out of the pantheon.

For example, [[Jergal]] split his portfolio among three mortals, [[Bane]], the new god of strife, [[Bhaal]], the new god of murder, and [[Myrkul]], the new god of death, the last whom Jergal served. Other mortals who arose to godhood were [[Azuth]], who needed to fight over his position with [[Savras]], [[Gwaeron Windstrom]], the [[Red Knight]], [[Torm]], and [[Uthgar]].

As mentioned above, the Farûnian pantheon was a single-sphere pantheon. Gods formed such with the objective of shutting out other world's deities from  Toril. That said, various deities managed to sneak into the pantheon of Toril and the number of such deities was expected to increase. That world was a favored destination of foreign deities who were losing influence for one or the other reason. Examples included [[Oghma]] and [[Silvanus]] from the Celtic pantheon, [[Tyr]] from the [[Norse pantheon]], and [[Loviatar]] and [[Mielikki]] from the Finnish pantheon, all entering the Faerûnian pantheon to cling to life and/or some degree of influence. Another example was [[Tyche]] from the Greek pantheon who split in two deities [[Beshaba]] and [[Tymora]] over the course of the [[Dawn Cataclysm]].

===Era of Upheaval===
====Time of Troubles====
[[File:AvatarCrisis.png|thumb|right|300px|''The gods being cast down to Toril during the Time of Troubles.'']]
{{main|Time of Troubles}}
The gods, not only of the Faerûnian pantheon but all of them, were cruel creatures who exploited mortals while not pursuing their duties on levels that horrified Ao, who was losing his patience with them because of it. The last straw was the theft of the ''[[Tablets of Fate]]'' at the hand of Bane and Myrkul, two deities of the Faerûnian pantheon. The [[Time of Troubles]] was started by Ao as a response.

During that time, a deity's avatar's death could mean the death of the deity. Among the deities who died were Bane, Bhaal, Myrkul, [[Mystra]], and Torm, the last one was reinstalled, the first three's positions were overtaken by [[Cyric]], and Mystra's was overtaken by [[Mystra (Midnight)|Midnight]]. Other deities who arose over the course of the Time of Troubles were [[Iyachtu Xvim]] and [[Finder Wyvernspur]] by killing an avatar of [[Moander]]. [[Shar]] killed two deities, [[Ibrandul]] and [[Eshowdow]]. The latter had potential to become important for the Shadow Giant was a member of the Chultan pantheon and Shar making inroads into that pantheon was an action that did potential harm to the agreement between the Faerûnian pantheon and the Chultan one.

A pantheon that stopped working as one because of the Time of Troubles was the [[Untheric pantheon]]. Its surviving members, [[Hoar]] and [[Tiamat]], signed up with the Faerûnian one. but the smaller Mulhorandi one feared to be swallowed up by the bigger one.

Another presumed effect of the Avatar Crisis was that the gods of the Faerûnian pantheon started to look out for other sources of faith outside of Toril to become more powerful.

====Interim Years====
The troublesome time for the Faerûnian pantheon did not end with the Time of Troubles. Cyric tried to increase his power. He killed [[Leira]] for that goal and ordered the writing of the ''[[Cyrinishad]]'', a book that made the reader believe that Cyric was the greatest person in existence, and completed it. He read it himself and fell into delusional hubris. In the wake of his madness, he lost the portfolio of death to [[Kelemvor]] and that of tyranny to Iyachtu Xvim. Cyric later came back to his senses in [[1371 DR]].

In [[1368 DR]], [[Velsharoon]] became a deity. In [[1372 DR]], Bane returned by killing his son Xvim.

In [[1374 DR]], [[Daelegoth Orndeir]] cast ''[[Amaunator's eternal sun]]'' and with it heralded the transformation of [[Lathander]] to [[Amaunator]]. In the same year, [[Mask]] handed his power and life over to [[Shar]].

In [[1384 DR]], Tyr killed [[Helm]] over the misunderstanding that the latter wanted an adulterous relationship with his wife [[Tymora]]. In [[1385 DR]], Tyr abdicated{{Cite digital book/The Crystal Mountain/Kindle|3449-3458}} and died fighting a demon horde.

In [[1385 DR]], Cyric murdered Mystra and with it the [[Spellplague]] happened. On the divine side, [[Savras]] died with [[Dweomerheart]], [[Deneir]] built himself and the Metatext into the [[Weave]] or what remained of it and ceased to exist.{{Cite digital book/The Ghost King/Kindle|2343-2350}}

====Post-Spellplague====
{{Main|Spellplague}}
After the Spellplague, various formerly racial deities made inroads into the Faerûnian pantheon and various racial deities turned out to be Faerûnian deities' aspects and vice versa.

Examples of gods who had aspects in the form of racial deities were [[Aerdrie Faenya]], who turned out to be [[Akadi]], or [[Hanali Celanil]], who turned out to be [[Sune]]. A reverse example was [[Talos]] who turned out to be [[Gruumsh]], the [[orc]]ish head deity.{{Cite dragon/378/Domains in Eberron and the Forgotten Realms|36-37}}

Members of racial pantheons who made inroads into the Faerûnian one were [[Corellon]], [[Ghaunadaur]], Gruumsh, [[Lolth]], and [[Moradin]].

Lolth tried to become the deity of magic in [[1480 DR]]. She failed and Mystra returned to power.

===Second Sundering===
{{Main|Second Sundering}}
In the wake of the [[Second Sundering]], a number of deities made their return. [[Drasek Riven]] put on the mantle of Mask.{{Cite digital book/The Godborn/Kindle|6085-6089}} The formerly racial deities left the Faerûnian pantheon for their racial ones.

==Members==
===Members after the Second Sundering===
The following were members of the Faerûnian pantheon after the Second Sundering:
;[[Akadi]]: Akadi was the embodiment of the [[element of air]] and [[neutral]] [[goddess]] of elemental air, speed, and flying creatures.
;[[Amaunator]]
:Amaunator was the [[lawful neutral]] [[Netherese]] [[The sun|solar]] deity of order, the sun, law, and time. He was prayed to for desirable weather, but was also the object of worship when keeping laws and oath was the matter at hand, for he was viewed as a strict deity to whom the rule of law was very important.
;[[Asmodeus]]
:Asmodeus was the Faerûnian [[lawful evil]] deity of indulgence and ruler of all [[devil]]s. His belief lived from the fact that when mortals did not follow their patron deity's edicts, they had a longer time to wait on the [[Fugue Plane]] or might stay there for eternity. People prayed to him to be provided with entertainment during the waiting time or cover their transgressions up so they had a chance to leave the Fugue Plane.
;[[Auril]]
:Auril was the fickle, vain, and [[evil]] deity of winter, who was primarily venerated out of fear. Her worship was done in cold regions in the hope of her making winter easier to live through.
;[[Azuth]]
:Azuth was the Faerûnian god of [[arcane magic]] whose concerns included the perpetuation of the [[magic]]al arts as a craft. He was the god of the practice of magic but not of magic itself.

;[[Bane]]
:Bane was the Faerûnian [[god]] of tyrannical oppression, terror, and hate, known across Faerûn as the face of pure evil through malevolent despotism. Bane stood for the notion that "might makes right".

However, even that often had a dark touch to it.
;[[Beshaba]]
:Beshaba was the [[chaotic evil]] intermediate deity of accidents, bad luck, misfortune, and random mischief, and a member of Tempus' pantheon. Worship of her was done to appease her and with it spare misfortune for themselves.
;[[Bhaal]]
:Bhaal was the widely feared Faerûnian god of violent and ritualistic murder. Naturally, praying to him was not something average people did. It was something those who killed did, either for a living or for other reasons.
;[[Chauntea]]
:Chauntea was the Faerûnian goddess of life, bounty, and agriculture, who viewed herself as the embodiment of all things agrarian. The Earthmother was seen as the tamer parallel of Silvanus, The Forest Father of [[druid]]ry and wilderness, as she was the deity of agriculture and plant cultivation. She had two aspects, one agricultural one that was almost exclusively prayed to in rural areas and one as a mother goddess, in whose aspect she collected faith from everybody who felt secure at home.
;[[Cyric]]
:Cyric was the monomaniacal Faerûnian god of strife and deception, and the greater god of conflict and murder, as well as lies, intrigue and illusion.

;[[Ilmater]]
:Ilmater was an intermediate deity of the Faerûnian pantheon whose portfolio included endurance, martyrdom, perseverance, and suffering. He was the god of those who suffered, the oppressed, and the persecuted, who offered them relief and support, encouraged them to endure, and who encouraged others to help them, to take their burdens or take their places. His worshipers often worked to diminish suffering in the world. This included both doing charitable work to tend to victims of calamities like plagues or war, but also stopping violence by force.

Her worshiper-base consisted of people who engaged in trade including in illegal ones like smuggling. They saw a virtue in creating business opportunities, which was why they were not on good footing with guilds and monopolies.

===Former Members===
The numerous former members could be broadly divided into two categories: Faerûnian deities who vanished in the wake of the Spellplague and Second Sundering, or racial deities of other pantheons that were briefly counted as part of the Faerûnian pantheon in the interim time between those two events.
