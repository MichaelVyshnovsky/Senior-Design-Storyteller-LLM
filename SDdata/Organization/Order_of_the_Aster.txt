The '''Order of the Aster''', also known as the '''Knights of the Aster'''{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|14}} or the '''Soldiers of Light''', was a militant order that served [[Lathander]] the Morninglord in the 14th century [[DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|8}} They took particular interest in thwarting the clergies of several malevolent deities such as [[Bane]], [[Shar]] and [[Talos]].

==Membership==
The order was loosely organized and comprised [[crusader]]s, [[fighter]]s, and paladins dedicated to Lathander. The paladins often trained in other discipline and served as [[divine champion]]s, [[divine disciple|disciples]], [[hierophant]]s, and even counted some members among [[Purple Dragon knight]]s of [[Cormyr]].

While all members of the order were devotees of Lathander with a comprehensive understanding of the [[Church of Lathander|church's]] teachings, some members had achieved the rank of [[Sunmaster]] within the divine hierarchy.

While members were not required to pay a fee upon entrance into the order, they did make a solemn vow to a standing [[Morninglord]]. The order's barracks were located one block from the main cathedral in Waterdeep and held 80 templars. The organization had a monthly due of 50 [[gp]] to be paid once per month.

==Dogma==
The paladins of the Aster were often more conservative and by-the-book than [[cleric]]s of Lathander.

==Activities==
Members usually defended Lathanderite shrines and temples, and commanded large military forces levied by the [[church of Lathander]] when required. Individual shrines and temples of Lathander typically did not maintain significant defensive forces of their own, owing to the cost, so they instead usually retained the Order's services to guard their holy sites, in appropriate numbers. 

When not thus engaged, the holy warriors of the order wandered the realms promoting the faith of Lathander and doing good deeds in his name. Many spent their time defending individual Lathanderite temples or served within the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]] of [[Waterdeep]].

==Relations==
Lathander's paladins stood as some of the most beloved heroes of the Realms, and the Order of the Aster was no exception.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1136}}, knights of the order fought off the [[dracolich]] [[Umbralax]] when it arrived in [[Faer√ªn]] from the [[Plane of Shadow]] along with the ruined village of [[Hespheira]]. Their victory at the [[Battle of Hespheira]] was aided in great part by their possession of the ''[[rod of Lathander]]'', but came at the loss of nearly half their members.
