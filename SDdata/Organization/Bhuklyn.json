        "mainbody": "The '''Bhuklyns''' were a collective of wealthy merchants, living within the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They made their living as [[iron]]-workers, making such everyday items as pots, cooking pans, hooks, chests and safe-boxes, including their specialty rodent-proof \"[[Bhuklyn's box]]es\", all stamped with the symbol of their house. The endogenous presence of their items within homes throughout the Bluff led to the saying \"Bhuklyn's is everywhere\".\n\nThe Bhuklyns had phenomenal sales throughout the entirety of [[the Vast]], and rewarded their purveyors with a larger-than-usual amount of the sales profits. While the Bhuklyns saw this as fair, it inspired significant loyalty within their vendors.",
        "History": "The origins of House Bhulkyn came from a group of merchants called the [[Raven Moon]]. One of their shareholders, [[Aldimo Bhuklyn]], bought out his associates and made the organization his own. He restructured the business from several brick-and-mortar shops to a great number of small street vendors, and began to promote Bhuklyn wares across [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]] and even as far south-west as [[Amn]]."
