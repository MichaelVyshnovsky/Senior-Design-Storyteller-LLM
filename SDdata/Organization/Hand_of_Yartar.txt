The '''Hand of Yartar''' was a largely female guild of thieves and assasins operating within the city of [[Yartar]].

==History==
''Circa'' [[1365 DR]], the Hand of Yartar was mostly female according to [[Volo]] and most were also young, as an old thief who had trouble outrunning a mark if they botched a theft would not live long.<ref>

In the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, the Hand of Yartar member [[Nareen Dhest]] stole a ''[[devastation orb]]'' from the Lord Protector's vaults in [[Triboar]]. Having no use for the weapon, the guild attempted to auction the item in the [[Wink and Kiss]] tavern in Yartar. However, another Hand named [[Haliyra Ravenfast]] secretly attempted to sell the item to agents of the [[Kraken Society]] instead.
