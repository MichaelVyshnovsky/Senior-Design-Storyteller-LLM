The '''Blood Riders''' were an organization of [[giant-killer]]s that originated in the [[Hartsvale]].{{Cite adventurers league/A Dish Best Served Cold|7}} 

==Activities==
The Blood Riders possessed a large stable of [[horse|war horses]] that they used to patrol the areas in which they operated. When not out patrolling or hunting they typically trained for battle, maintained their armaments, and cared for their horses.

Anyone who joined the Blood Riders was branded on their right arm with the [[giant language|giant rune]] for death.

==History==
By [[1366 DR]]{{Giantcraft date}} the group's activity had largely died down and was being kept alive by a few stalwart [[ranger]]s .

By the late 15{{th}} century the organization reformed due to increased [[giant]] activity throughout the [[Sword Coast]].{{Cite adventurers league/A Dish Best Served Cold|4}} 

Cathica sought to incite war with the area's giants at any cost.{{Cite adventurers league/A Dish Best Served Cold|14}} Thus, when she returned to camp she spun a tall tale to the rest of the organization, claiming that it was the giants who broke their unspoken peace with [[Hartsvale]] by attacking them whilst they were on a routine patrol of the Cold Woods. She urged their leader, [[Scarn Mikel]], to execute the giant as a show of strength. However, Scarn was reluctant to do this as he believed the giant could be used as a bargaining chip should his tribe attack them.

==Relationships==
The King of Hartsvale in the late 15{{th}} century considered them a danger to his entire kingdom, as he highly prioritized maintaining peace with the local giants, but lacked the resources to force them into disbanding. This sentiment of disdain was shared by major organizations with interest in the area such as the [[Order of the Gauntlet]], the [[Lords' Alliance]], and the [[Zhentarim]].{{Cite adventurers league/A Dish Best Served Cold|5-6}}

==Areas of Activity==
The Blood Riders operated in the [[Cold Wood]]s, though they had no distinct base of operations as they nomadically moved their campsite from one location to another.{{Cite adventurers league/A Dish Best Served Cold|13}}

==Notable Members==
* Cathica Lygia, the Blood Rider's ruthless second-in-command in the late 15{{th}} century.
