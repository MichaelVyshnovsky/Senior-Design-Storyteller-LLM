        "mainbody": "The Reforged Ring was, as of 1479 DR, a relatively new criminal gang in the town of Skullport.\nMembers of the gang were initiated with a painful rite that involved branding the ring finger with a set of red-hot tongs.  The branding made it difficult for gang members to leave the gang since many people outside of Skullport understood the significance of the brand and wouldnt hesitate to attack slavers.\nThe gangs name invoked the name of the Iron Ring, a slaver gang that operated in Skullport in the 14th century DR.  The gang owned slave pens and warehouses throughout the town.  The gang was not very popular in Skullport and was despised by the Lowfellows who had a large number of slaves within their ranks.\nCategoryCriminal organizations\nCategorySlaving organizations\nCategoryOrganizations in Skullport\nCategoryOrganizations in Undermountain\nCategoryOrganizations in Waterdeep\nCategoryOrganizations on the Sword Coast North\nCategoryOrganizations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\nr8wpa7g0kvtj2fztruw3kuzoq9f7de8"
