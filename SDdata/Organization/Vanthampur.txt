The Vanthampur family was one of several clans of wealthy patriars that composed the nobility of Baldurs Gate. They owed much of their success to the civil engineering they provided for the city, primarily by the familys matriarch Duke Thalamra, who previously served as the citys Master of Drains and Underways.
The Vanthampur familys motto is "Stone hearts never bleed."Adam Lee, Christopher Perkins (September 17, 2019). Baldurs Gate Descent into Avernus. (Wizards of the Coast), p. 36. ISBN 0786966769.
