The '''Vinson''' family was an influential [[Amn]]ian mercantile family during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
In [[Trailstone]], they operated [[Nastral's Provisioners]], the biggest general supply store in the town. They tried to avoid notice beyond this, and it was widely rumored that they had some unpleasant business with the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1333}}, Lord Kirsoph managed to become a founder of the Council of Six and became [[Dahaunarch]]. He attempted to have [[Pommarch]] [[Wulver Xornnag]] assassinated in the {{YearlinkName|1342}}, but he was slain by his own bribed guards in return.

Losing their patriarch in [[Athkatla]], the Vinsons retreated to Trailstone under the leadership of [[Nastral Vinson]] and quietly managed their countryside estates and vineyards. They remained relatively powerful and wealthy, but consciously chose to live in obscurity and refused to engage in the high-stakes plots and intrigue of Amn.

==Members==
* Lord [[Kirsoph Vinson]], a member of the Council.
* [[Nastral Vinson]], the son of Kirsoph.
