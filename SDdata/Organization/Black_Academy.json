        "Activities": "The rites of initiation was largely shrouded in secrecy to outsiders. Applicants to the school had to pass a potentially fatal screening within the Hall of Petitioners. They then had to pay an initiation fee of 300 [[gold piece]]s and prepare a ''[[corpse candle]]'' to further prove their worth. Additionally, each semester students had to pay a fee of 60 gold pieces and either animate or create some form of corporeal undead. These creations would be taken and turned over to the communal \"dead pool\".\n\n[[File:BlackAcademy Anatomy101.png|thumb|273px|''Instructor Ngise hunches over an examination table in the classroom of Anatomy 101.'']]\nBlack Academy members engaged in a variety of experiments<ref name=drag371-p10\" /> and received schooling in both anatomy and necromantic practices. and performed evil ceremonies and rites that were specifically designed to garner Acererak's attention and favor, usually performing such ceremonies on a weekly basis.\n\nBeyond just necromancer-style spellcasters, students at the school were known to overtime take up lives as either [[assassin]]s, [[blackguard]]s, and pale masters.\n\nStudents with the lowest marks in each class<ref group=\"note\" name=\"expulsion\">''Return to the Tomb of Horrors'' features a student that was simply expelled from the academy.

According to some outsiders, the failing student also gave up their immortal [[soul]] to the Black Academy's leadership.",
        "Tactics": "In order to ensure their secrecy, the Black Academy often kidnapped those who openly told stories about them or killed them in various creative and horrible ways.",
        "Base of Operations": "For many the exact location of the Black Academy was a mystery, often referred to in rumors as being in some dreary swamp atop the crypt of an ancient [[lich]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"location\">In the original ''Tomb of Horrors'' module, the titular dungeon was not given an exact location, but rather six different locations on [[Oerth]] were given as possible locations. When the dungeon was revisited in ''Return to the Tomb of Horrors'', the dungeon was given the precise location of the [[w:c:greyhawk:Vast Swamp|Vast Swamp]] in the country of [[w:c:greyhawk:Sunndi|Sunndi]] on Oerth. It was revisited again in 4{{th}} edition, in the module simply titled ''Tomb of Horrors''. There the location was once more left ambiguous, though the text somewhat implied [[Nerath]] as the setting by stating Acererak lived in the empire of [[w:c:pointsoflight:Bael Turath|Bael Turath]]. And the latest map of Oerth's [[w:c:greyhawk:Flaeness|Flaeness]] region, presented in the [[Dungeon Master's Guide 5th edition (revised)|revised 5{{th}} edition ''Dungeon Master's Guide'']], depicts the Tomb of Horrors as once more being in the Vast Swamp of Sunndi. at a spot where the barrier between the [[Prime Material]] and the [[Shadowfell]] was thin.<ref name=drag371-p10\" /> An assortment of various homes, shops, and graveyards behind a steep wall.<ref name=drag371-p10\" /> This wall was {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} high, {{SI|4|ft|long=yes}} thick, and constructed of black stone. The only way in was bone gateway,<ref> made out of the bones of the dungeon's victims.<ref name=drag371-p10\" />\n\n[[File:BlackAcademy Auditorium.png|thumb|273px|''Students sit in attention in the auditorium room.'']]\nThe academy itself was a looming structure made of black stone,<ref name=drag371-p10\" /> {{SI|80|ft|long=yes}} high, resembling the upper half of a skull. Each of the skull's {{SI|20|ft|long=yes}} tooth-pillars was carved with all manner of images most macabre,<ref name=drag371-p10\" /> such as rotting skeletal figures, and a library that had a collection of various lore on Acererak and his plots. and the foyer were filled with hundreds of student-made ''corpse candles''.\n\nUnder an arch inscribed with necromantic runes and through a lack curtain stood the Hall of Petition. It was a room covered from floor to ceiling in {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} squares of [[obsidian]]. It was dominated by a [[granite]] [[construct]], as large as an [[ogre]], that was shaped like a skeleton and attached to the wall. Both of its hands were raised to waist level, with the palms situated upward and each inset with a flat palm-shaped tile of obsidian. Each time the curtain to the room was parted the construct's eyes would flare red and it would utter in a menacing voice, \"Enter, and be judged, petitioners!\" Upon some entering the room it would instruct potential students to place their hands upon the palm-shaped tiles, stating, \"To gain complete access to the Black Academy, you must place your hands in mine.\" Once this instruction was followed it would utter, \"Hold still\", and grasp the hands touching its tiles.\n\nThe construct emitted a beam of light from its eyes when examining potential students, identifying their [[alignment]] and whether or not they are a necromancer or a [[mage]] in general. This process wasn't foolproof, as the construct could be tricked by magical abilities or items that shielded the mind. If a student wasn't detected to be a spellcaster, or if they were detected to be of a [[good]] alignment, the construct's palms would transmit a powerful electric shock and the beam would start to emit [[death magic]], ripping out the victim's soul, which would then be deposited into Acererak's phylactery. Once this display finished the construct would announce, \"Admittance denied. Next!\" If a candidate did meet the requirements for admission, then the beam of light would narrow to the thinness of a [[quill]] and burn a [[tattoo]] of a skull onto the forehead. Once this was done, the construct would announce, \"You have Mistress Ferranifer's permission to study at the Black Academy. See Instructor Ngise for remedial classes. Next!\"\n\nA small stud close to the construct, when pressed, would cause it to swing open on [[hinges]] and reveal the entrance to the academy's catacombs. The academy's own entrance to the Tomb of Horrors, referred to as the Shrine of the Black Academy, was a chamber enclosing the northern edge of the hill. Hundreds of ''corpse candles'' were along its walls, on the floor, and in various [[candlestick]]s and [[candelabra]]s. Only the headmaster and the academy's primary instructors were allowed to enter.\n\nSituated next to the academy was a huge black [[tent]], measuring {{SI|70|ft|long=yes}} by {{SI|70|ft}}. Referred to as the \"Dead Pool\", it housed all of the Black Academy's undead, who stood in a shallow muddy bowl. No light could penetrate the tent and its interior was lit only by a suspended orb, which emitted a sickly green light.",
        "Possessions": "[[File:BlackAcademyGraverobbing.png|thumb|273px|''Undead servitors make getting new materials easy for Black Academy members.'']]\nAll full fledged necromancers within the Black Academy had a small image of a skull tattooed on their foreheads. This could only be removed with ''[[limited wish]]'' or similar [[spell]]s.\n\nMembers of the Black Academy had access to the \"Dead Pool\", a common pool of undead creatures that performed manual labor for the Academy. Usually full of lower forms of undead, necromancers could drop off any servitors that they weren't using or (more often) that were damaged.",
        "History": {
            "Realms History": "Sometime prior to the [[Second Sundering]], in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], a male [[human]] necromancer from the Bleak Academy who was seeking to improve his necromantic craft began operating within an ancient [[Unther]]i burial site in [[Tymanther]], near the frontier village of [[Ruinspoke]]. Deep within a mausoleum at the burial site, the necromancer discovered a vein of [[onyx]]. He began harvesting this vein, as well as excavating most of the tombs and burial sights in the area, for [[material component]]s and body parts so he could cast the ritual ''[[undead servitor]]'' on a daily basis.{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|5}}<ref group=\"note\" name=\"Unther\">It is not specified in the adventure whether the ruins being explored belonged to Unther or [[Tymanchebar]]. However, due to the adventure only making note of ruins of \"the old Untheric Empire\" and the presence of a [[Lathander]]ite sarcophagus in the mausoleum, it stands to reason the ruins were from Unther. The undead he created through this spell included two [[corpse of despair|corpses of despair]], three [[famine hound]]s,{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|19}} a [[zombie grave digger]], a [[lasher zombie]], and four [[rot hound]]s.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|10-12}} His profane rituals would cause necromantic energy to seep out from the mausoleum and into the surrounding area.\n\nAt some point, the necromancer’s lair was stumbled upon by [[Melnar]], a [[dwarf]] explorer and member of the [[Gem Assayers Union]] who had been surveying various ruins in the area. Spotting him through a ''[[Skull Watch]]'', the necromancer had his undead servants subdue Melnar and bring the dwarf to the ritual chamber he had set up, reasoning that a living test subject was always preferable to a dead one. After not hearing from him for two days, Melnar’s friend [[Dirnth]] hired a group of adventurers to find him. When the adventurers finally made it inside of the mausoleum they found Melnar strapped down in a room with half-finished skeletons and zombies. Sources differed as to whether the adventurers killed the necromancer, turned him over to the authorities in Ruinspoke, or failed to defeat him.<ref>{{Cite organized play/LFR/From One Dwarf to Another|26}}"
