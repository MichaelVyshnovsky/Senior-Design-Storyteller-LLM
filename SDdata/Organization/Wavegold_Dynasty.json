[[Erdhinn Wavegold I]] could trace a lineage from the early [[Torlath]] dynasty through [[Jamyll Torlath]], and took the throne to stabilize the realm before it collapsed completely.\n\nThe family ruled for over a century before misfortune and circumstance put an end to its name. King [[Belhinn Wavegold II]] died fighting the [[orc]]s of the [[Black Horde]] in the {{YearlinkName|1237}}, and the crown passed to the husband of his daughter, Princess [[Peldara Wavegold|Peldara]]. This made his son-in-law King [[Malek Parhek|Malek]] of the [[Parhek]] dynasty, the last royal family of Amn.",
