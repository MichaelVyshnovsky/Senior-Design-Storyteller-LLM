        "mainbody": "The '''Golden Mane''' was a [[wemic]] pride that roamed the grasslands of the [[Shaar]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were a closely knit family whose migratory patterns kept a balance with the other roaming tribes and herds of prey animals.{{Cite web enhancement/Wemic Camp|1}}",
        "Activities": {
            "Migration": "The wemics of the Golden Mane had a series of camps established in the [[Shaar]]an plains through which they would rotate as the seasons passed by during the year. They would hunt the local game around a camp for a couple of months, depending on the availability of prey. When the time was appropriate to move on, they would leave an offering to [[Nobanion]] and mark their past stay to other wemics before continuing onward to their next settlement. The Golden Mane would occasionally share their camp sites with other prides, and even herds of [[loxo]] when they were not in use.\n\nUpon arrival at the next camp in the cycle,{{Cite web enhancement/Wemic Camp|2}}"
        },
        "Members": "As of [[1373 DR]], the Golden Mane had four adult males, ten females and four wemic cubs. The leader of the pride was the authoritative [[Shaq'ar]], a powerful warrior who partnered with the elegant and agile mother-figure [[Wrokeen]]. The [[sorcerer|sorcerous]] [[Beren]], who possessed dark [[magic]], was a challenger to Shaq'ar's authority.",
        "History": "In their youth, Shaq'ar encouraged Beren to travel beyond the grasslands and seek out adventure after the dark and greedy wemic showed himself to be uncooperative within the pride. Beren ventured closer to the \"civilized\" lands where he learned the ways of thievery and uncovered his innate affinity for [[the Art]], a skill which he continued to strengthen.\n\nHe returned to the Golden Mane some years later, much more adept at hunting. He used the skills he learned among his fellow [[rogue]]s to perform adroit stealth attacks upon his prey. While this type of combat was looked down upon the traditionally-[[barbarian|barbaric]] wemics of the pride, Beren explained his unscrupulous kills as simply a matter of luck.\n\nThe black-mained sorcerer constantly plotted against Shaq'ar and sought to take over as leader of the wemics. He reached out to other groups of wemics, the nomadic [[Shaaran]]s, herds of loxo and even a band of [[thri-kreen]] whose conflicts with the pride had repeatedly ended in violence."
