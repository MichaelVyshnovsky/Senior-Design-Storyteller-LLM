        "mainbody": "The '''church of Shaundakul''', also known as the '''Priests of the Helping Hand''' and the '''Seekers of the Trail''', It was an ancient faith of [[Faerûn]] that diminished in influence over time, before enjoying a rebirth during the [[Era of Upheaval]].\n\n{{Quote|Ride the wind and let it take you wherever it blows.

            "Titles": "A loosely-structured ranking of titles were used within the Shaundakun church. These included: ''Seeker of the Wind'', ''Scout'', ''Trailblazer'', ''Explorer'', ''Guide of the Hidden Ways'', ''Rider of the West Wind'', ''Rider of the South Wind'', ''Rider of the East Wind'', ''Rider of the North Wind'', and ''Lord High Windhand''."

        "Activities": "{{Quote|Me telling you a route is free, but if you want a map, it'll cost you coins.|[[Thal Pevrem]] of [[Berdusk]].}}\n\nPriests of Shaundakul did not promote their faith by preaching to non-believed, but rather through providing aid and protection to others. Shaundakun clergy forged bonds between the church and those wanderers and traders that explored the lands less-traveled. They served others as scouts, guards, and guides, often traveling alongside pilgrims, [[adventurer]]s, and caravaneers for great lengths of their journeys. They were dedicated to reestablishing the shrines of Shaundakul across the Realms, many of which had been lost over centuries of neglect and disuse.\n\nAfter Shaundakul took on the related divine portfolio, his clergy dedicated themselves to locating and identifying ''[[portal]]s'' that would benefit the lives of people in the Realms. Over time they were even granted the power to merge themselves with ''portals'' and use the energy within to rejuvenate their bodies.\n\nThey were also known as purveyors of exceptionally accurate maps and trade ways for a nominal fee. They were far less forthcoming about information regarding known ''portals'', and always at a much steeper price.",
        "Rituals": "Members of the clergy performed simple prayers and ceremonies throughout their travels. They spoke a prayer to Shaundakul every instance the wind shifted suddenly, and erected a new shrines upon discovering uncharted landmarks or natural wonders.\n\nPriests of Shaundakul prayed for their spells during the early hours of the morn, as the change in temperature caused the winds to stir.",
        "Celebrations": {
            "Regions": "The faith of Shaundakul was closely tied to the city of [[Myth Drannor]] in the [[Cormanthor]] forest. By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] it was prominent throughout the vast wastes of [[Stonelands]] and [[Moonsea North]], the frigid land of [[Thesk]], the mysterious [[Great Dale]], and the rustic [[Dalelands]].",
            "Places of Worship": "Due to the restlessness of his faithful, there were few permanent houses of worship dedicated to the Shaundakul found throughout the Realms. Smaller shrines―often formed stone daises surrounded by several stone pillars―were much more common, often located in more isolated and perilous stretches of wilderness."

            "Dress": "[[File:Priest of Shaundakul.png|thumb|right|300px|''A priest of Shaundakul in ceremonial vestments.'']]\nShaundakun priests wore simple cloths for both ceremonies and during travel. They were accented by a flowing cloak and a dark-purple or black gauntlet on their dominant hand, bearing Shaundakul's [[holy symbol]].",
            "Weapons & Arms": "They dressed in [[leather]], [[studded leather]], or [[chain mail]] armor, and preferred wielding [[greatsword]]s and [[bow]]s in combat.",

        "Orders": "The [[Knights of the Shadow Sword]] was an order of Shaundakun [[ranger]]s and warriors that worked to cleanse the ruins of Myth Drannor from its evil denizens for centuries following the city's collapse.\n\nA group of noble [[mercenaries]] known as the [[Riders of the West Wind]] traveled the Realms protecting caravans from bandits, raiders, or more malevolent organizations such as the [[Zhentarim]]. The [[Fellowship of the Next Mountain]] was an order that performed similar services for the people of the Moonsea North and [[Sword Coast North]].",
        "Classes": "The church attracted many [[ranger]]s and [[crusader]]s within its ranks. [[Specialty priest]]s of Shaundakul were known as [[windwalker (class)|windwalkers]], These free-spirited individuals learned to meld the winds themselves to hasten their travels across the Realms.",
        "Relationships": "Priests occasionally quested alongside [[windghost]]s, bizarre-looking but docile [[aberration]]s that were dispatched by Shaundakul himself. Together they carried out missions important to the Rider and his faith.",
        "History": "Shaundakul was an ancient deity, having been present during the era of the [[Dawn Cataclysm]] when [[Tyche]] remained the sole goddess of fortune. It was prominent during the century before [[Dale Reckoning]], when the [[Rus]] people still dwelled in the [[Unapproachable East]].\n\nShaundakul's faith reached its apex during the time of ancient Myth Drannor which fell during the 8{{th}} century DR. and many of his followers turned to [[Mielikki]] and [[Waukeen]].\n\nThe [[Time of Troubles]], which occurred in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, was a transformative time for the Shaundakun faith. By the time the [[Faerûnian pantheon|gods]] were restored to their homes in the cosmos, there remained only a half dozen priests of Shaundakul, each of whom had taken on the mantle of 'Windwalker'.",
