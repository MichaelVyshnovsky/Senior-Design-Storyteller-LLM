        "mainbody": "he Circle of Nine was the loosely-organized collection of deities widely-worshiped in the Vilhon Reach.\nThe Nine included the main major deities worshiped in the region with numerous temples and shrines smattered across towns, cities, and remote private areas. As of the , the Circle of Nine included Eldath, Helm, Lliira, Malar, Nobanion, Silvanus, Talos, Tempus, and Tyr.\nThe Church of Eldath found a place in the Vilhon Reach as a contrast to the regions endless conflicts and violence. The Goddess of the Shining Waters was the bitter enemy of Malar. She had worshipers in secluded areas of the Reach, as well as the center of faith– The Grove in Cedarsproke, and another major temple in the lizardfolk city of Surkh. Smaller shrines could be found in Sapra, Hlath, Hlondeth, Ormpetarr, among other less civilized places.\nThe Church of Lliira was a growing power in the Vilhon Reach as of the late 14 century DR. She picked up a lot of worshipers from Waukeen during the Merchants Friends absence from the Realms. A high number of festivals and celebrations cemented the goddesss hold in the region. The center of worship in the Vilhon Reach was in Gildenglade. Her temples stood in Alaghôn, Arrabar, and Surkh, while shrines could be found in Hlondeth, Reth, Lachom, and village of Ravilars Cloak.\nThe Cult of Malar was a major threat to the common folk of the Vilhon following the deitys avatar appearing there during the Time of Troubles. Malar was worshiped as the Stalker and apart from several human and demi-human cults, he was served by wolves, giants, and the goblinkind.\nThe Lion God of Gulthmere was known as the defender of the Reach who clashed with the Stalker in a fierce battle during the Godswar. The Church of Nobanion was found in the Gulthmere Forest and the Shining Plains where the lion was worshiped by cultists who lived almost feral life inspired by the regions real cats and wemic tribes. The center of faith was centered on in the Machran Spire and the village of Gurnth.\nThe Church of Silvanus was a major force in the green Vilhon Reach, helmed by the Emerald Enclave that spread its operations from the isle Ilighôn, off the coast of the Vilhon. The followers of the Oak Rather had a long history of nature protection and eco-terrorism, most often clashing them with Turmish and Chondath due to their heavy logging industries. The center of the faith was the Oakenhal on Ilighôn, with major temples found in Alaghôn, Hlondeth, Ormath, Lachom, Ormpetarr, Arrabar, and Reth. Shrines were very common and some of the settlements with shrines included Iljak, Hlath, Nun, Urml, Ulvers Lance, Banathar, Dauntshield, and Swordslake Creek.\nThe Church of Talos, just like the worship of Tempus, was fueled by copious conflicts, wars, and violence in the Vilhon Reach. Talosian worship was done secretly, and his temples and shrines were well-hidden. Unmanned shrines were known to spring in the places of wars and disasters, with one notable shrine being erected in the Shining Plains, celebrating the Great Fires.\nThe Church of Tempus was another powerful religious presence in the Reach. However, the worship fell somewhat after the disastrous conclusion of the Chondathan Rotting Wars. Tempus was considered a major religion in the nations of Chondath and Sespech with its two major temples built in Arrabar and Ormpetar. The center of worship in the region was in the small town of Nun, scarred by the Rotting War. Other temples were in Alaghôn, Ormath, Lheshayl, Sapra, and Nimpeth.\nLastly, the Church of Tyr spoke to many inhabitants of the Vilhon Reach who craved justice. Unlike other places in the realms, the concept of justice was somewhat skewed towards conflict and not social goods nor equality. As of the late 14 century DR, Tyr worship was aimed at delivering swift justice to the bloodthirsty cultists of Malar. Alaghôn was considered the center of the Tyrran faith, with other major temples in Lheshayl, Ormpetarr, and Hlath. Tyrs shrines ould be found in Nun, Nimpeth, Ulvers Lance, and Bistals Bottom."
