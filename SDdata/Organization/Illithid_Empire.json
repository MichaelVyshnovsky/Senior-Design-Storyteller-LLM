        "mainbody": "The '''Illithid Empire'''<ref group=\"note\">The article refers to the multiverse-spanning empire of the Illithids, not [[Nihilath]], a singular illithid empire found somewhere in the [[Underdark]]. was the multiversal empire that spanned many [[planes of existence]], long before the history of the multiverse was recorded.\n\n{{Quote|Past all knowledge of present worlds, before the crowning of Ra, when the Outer Planes were yet in flux, and while the elemental planes remained untarnished by counter-contamination, the illithids held an ancient empire.|''Excerpt from ''[[The Planetreader's Primer]]''.}}\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}",
        "Organization": "At its height, the illithid race held control over vast swathes of the [[Astral Plane|astral]] and [[Ethereal plane|ethereal planes]], countless [[planet]]s on the [[Prime Material plane]], and even the furthest edges of the [[Outer Planes]].",
        "Activities": "{{Quote|Imagine that everywhere. Wants, needs, choice - all would cease to be. Everything rendered unto the illithids.|''Ch'r'ai [[W'wargaz]]''.}}\n\nTo continue their ongoing conquest, illithids harnessed the power of the stars themselves. They partitioned entire planes of existence to house the peoples they enslaved, who served as mere pack animals or fodder for their expansive war.\n\nAs they conquered world after world, the imperial illithids exterminated an untold number of [[humanoid]] races.",
        "Tactics": "To travel from world to world, the illithids employed unique magic to create [[spelljamming]] vessels,",
        "Base of Operations": "The great Illithid Empire originated from the artificially-created world of [[Penumbra]]. The colossal, artificial world was larger than the orbit of many planets, created out of [[substare]] in the shape of a perfectly flat disc. Within the center of Penumbra was a singular gaping hole, within which rested a star.",
        "History": {
            "War of Rebellion": "The Illithid Empire faced several slave revolts throughout its existence, and nearly all were put down by the mind flayer's―as they were more commonly known―potent [[psionic]] powers. Over time, illithid slaves began to develop minor resistances to psionics, and those clever enough to hide the protection they possessed even came to develop their own latent abilities of the mind. \n\nA single leader named [[Gith]] rallied forth [[Gith (race)|her people]]―a group that would come to bear her name The individual known as [[Zerthimon]] became a prophet to [[githzerai|his own people]], and spread the knowledge of how to effectively combat the illithids to others.\n\nPenumbra itself even fell to the thralls of the illithids. The myriad slave races overthrew their oppressors and threw the world itself into chaos.",
            "Downfall & Aftermath": "{{Quote|Footprint of a fallen light.<br />Seed of a tumbled empire;<br />When hope dwindes in eternal night,<br />Master the past―reignite the fire.|A lingering psychic message left by an illithid artifact.}}\n\nRegardless of the illithids' origins,  Gith and her people earned their initial victory in earnest. Word of their victory spread, and world after world that remained under illithid control liberated themselves from their imperial overlords. The illithid race was slaughtered ''en masse'' across the cosmos. \n\nWhile their once-mighty empire was toppled, few surviving illithids remained after the great rebellion. Their race was forced to live in small, isolated communities,\n\nRemaining illithids were hunted down like animals by the githyanki ''rrakkmas'', one of the two divergent races of the original gith people.",
            "Return": "[[File:Elder brain CLB alt.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''One possible means by which the illithids could execute the Grand Design.'']]\n{{Quote|The Grand Design is what all ''ghaik'' seek. The restoration of the Illithid Empire, which spanned the entirety of the multiverse. For centuries, their elder brains sought to bring back their dominion.|''Ch'r'ai W'wargaz''.}}\n\nThe illithid remained as they ever were, an exceptionally patient and calculating race. \n\nIndividual efforts to carry out the Grand Design were repeatedly ended, often by the ever-vigilant githyanki who swore vengeance upon their long-ago oppressors. It was theorized by some however, that even the subterranean illithids of the impossible future―who dwelled on cold, husk planets nourished only by near-spent stars―would form their empire once again. It was said they would consume all hope from existence in their unimaginable cruelty."
        },
        "Legacy": "The rise and fall of the Illithid Empire had consequences that spanned the breadth of the universe, some of which would not likely have been expected. It was the technology found within illithid nautiloids for example, that inspired the invention of githyanki [[astral ship]]s and other vessels capable of navigating [[wildspace]]."
