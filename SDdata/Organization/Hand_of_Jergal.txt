The Hand of Jergal was an elite order of priests devoted to Jergal, the Lord of the End of Everything.
The priests of the Hand of Jergal commanded groups tasked with avenging slights against Jergal or his church. The most common of these offenses was raising or resurrecting someone without paying tribute to Jergal. Another common offense was looting a tomb under the churchs protection.
The Hand of Jergal was extinct as of the midâ€“14 century DR.
