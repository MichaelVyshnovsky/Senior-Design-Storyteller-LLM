Immerdusk was a noble house of Cormyr. It was based in Arabel.
The Immerdusks supported Gondegal when he tried to usurp the kingdom in 1352 DR.
During the Abraxus affair, the Immerdusks (like many noble families with country estates) favored Vangerdahast as regent instead of a ruling noble council if King Azoun IV died.
