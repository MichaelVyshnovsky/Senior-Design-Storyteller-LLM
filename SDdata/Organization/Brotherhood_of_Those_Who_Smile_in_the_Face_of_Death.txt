==History==
{{fq
| text   = The paladins of the hated Osiris are upon us. They lay siege to our walls. I myself have sent three of their number to their god for judgment. They slay young and old alike, offering no quarter. So we will flee through the bayous to the River of Swords, where we can be safe. The paladins donâ€™t dare attack us there. Sekras is lost.

}}The Brotherhood was founded following the {{YearlinkName|1183}}, by paladins who had come together to destroy the town of [[Sekras]], The paladins' assault on Sekras, which was tacitly endorsed also by the [[church of Horus-Re]], They successfully drove the [[church of Sebek|Cult of Sebek]] underground and pushed much of the surviving werecrocodile population out of Mulhorand. The surviving paladins went on to found the Brotherhood.

Following the [[Time of Troubles]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Brotherhood turned its attention to fighting the [[church of Tiamat]] in [[Unther]], a mission which cost the lives of many of their members.
