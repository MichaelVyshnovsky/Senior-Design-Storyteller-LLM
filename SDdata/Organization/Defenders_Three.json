        "mainbody": "The Defenders Three were a band of three halfling brothers that worked as guards and messengers for Lord Ultas Maernos in Waterdeep, circa 1370 DR. When Maernos passed away, they became the administrators of Holyhands House on the grounds of the former Maernos family compound in the North Ward.\nThe group consisted of Amstor \"the Grim\", a worshiper of Arvoreen, Asohs \"the Daring\", a reformed spy, and Pithar \"the Bold\", a former tavern bouncer and a former member of the City Watch. They did not choose the name \"Defenders Three\"â€”it was what their acquaintances called them.\nDuring the last few years of Lord Maernos life, the three brothers worked as his personal bodyguards and messengers. Ultas was an ally of the Harpers and occasionally had them carry packages or messages to Harper agents in Baldurs Gate, Luskan, and Mirabar. Of the three, only Asohs intuited the affiliation of these deliveries, and he kept it between himself and Lord Maernos. After Ultas passing, they remained in the villa and helped establish it as a place of worship for the demihumans of Waterdeep.\nHolyhands House (the former Maernos mansion) was located in the North Ward between Copper Street and the High Road about five blocks south of the Upper Towers between Delzorin Street and Sidle Street.\nThe Defenders Three were treated with honor, respect, and friendship by Lord Maernos, but acquired enemies by serving him so effectively. Among his enemies were Lord Nimor Lathkule and Lady Stelar Nesher (consort to Laskar Nesher and member of the Thorp family).\nMany younger nobles accepted and befriended the Defenders Three. It was primarily the older generation of nobility that did not want to see demihumans elevated above the level of servants.\nTheir work for Lord Maernos on behalf of the Harpers made them important allies to that secretive organization.\nThey successfully thwarted an assassination attempt during their trial period with House Maernos, which won them permanent employment status and Ultas trust and friendship. Lord Maernos became a target of the anger and indignation of certain Waterdhavian nobles when word got out that he wanted to donate his villa to become a temple specifically for the non-human residents of Waterdeep. The Defenders Three exposed or foiled a number of plots and proved their capability many times over.\nIt was Amstor that persuaded his brothers to join him in service to Lord Maernos after overhearing disparaging remarks about the nobles devotion to the cause of demihumans and all the major temples in the city, including the Plinth.\n* Amstor \"the Grim\"\n* Asohs \"the Daring\"\n* Pithar \"the Bold\""
