The Creative Creed was one of the major illithid Creeds in the Realms. They advocated that the best way to expand their knowledge base was to create, invent, or discover new psionic disciplines, technology, and psionic items. They successfully built flying craft, living troop transports and weaponry, and other unique psionic items.
In Oryndoll, illithids in the Creative Creed worked in The Workshops, which were their laboratories. Many workshops were actually located in individual domiciles but were still able to accommodate one to twelve illithid scientists.
