'''Clan Gethmara''' was one of the [[dragonborn]] [[Thymari#Clans|clans]] of the nation of [[Tymanther]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Death before Dishonor|8}}

==History==
At some point prior to [[1479 DR]], nearly all prominent members of Clan Gethmara were killed in what was known as the "Gethmara massacre". Many blamed [[Clan Vkriss]] as the perpetrators of the deed, but there was no evidence of Clan Vkriss involvement in the crime.
