The '''Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye''' was dedicated to bringing the evil god [[Tharizdun]], an interloper god from the [[Oerth]] universe who was imprisoned in the [[Abyss]], into [[Faerûn]]. The cult was related to the Church of All Tomorrows, an Oghman heresy that believed its followers should be able to foresee the future.

==History==
The cult first appeared in [[1340 DR]] in [[Akanûl]] when that country was part of [[Chessenta]].  It was destroyed shortly thereafter, possibly with the help of [[Mystra]].  In [[1479 DR]], the cult re-emerged and infiltrated the [[Firestorm Cabal]] in [[Airspur]] when the [[demon]] and cult leader [[Murmur]] possessed the body of a high-ranking officer of the cabal.  The cult used the vaults underneath the cabal's headquarters to practice its rituals which included human sacrifice.	  

The [[Deva (aasimar)|deva]] [[Demascus]] was assigned by [[Oghma]] to disrupt the cult's activities.  With several [[rogue]] allies, he killed Murmur and later [[Kalkan]].
