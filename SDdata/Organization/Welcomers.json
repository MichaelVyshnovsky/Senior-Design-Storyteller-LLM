        "mainbody": "The Welcomers, also called the Welcoming Committee, was the lone thieves guild in Phlan as of 1367 DR.\nMost of the natives of Phlan knew the guildmembers by sight, perhaps because of their overt operations or their unique self-mutilation, prompting the guild to mostly target visitors to the city and adopt their sarcastic guild name.\nMembers of the Welcomers notoriously cut off their left ear to prove their loyalty to the guild.\nThough not officially sanctioned, the guild was allowed to exist because of their usefulness as scouts and defenders of Phlan during the past."
