The '''Gauntlet''' was a law-enforcement company based in the [[Tears of Selûne]] in the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The company's primary objective was to rid Realmspace of all slave trade and imprisonment of innocent people. Around {{Yearlink|1358}}, the Gauntlet were the self-proclaimed law-enforcement agency of the Tears of Selûne. They were always busy fighting [[mind flayer]]s and [[neogi]].

==Base of Operations==
The company operated from their updated [[scorpion (spelljammer)|scorpion]] [[spelljammer]], the ''[[Gauntlet (spelljammer)|Gauntlet]]''. The ship had magical enhancements applied to all its weapons for increased accuracy, damage, and reach.

==History==
The company was founded by [[Kyriel Alathar Pellinore]], a [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]]. Formerly a member of the [[Council of Elders]] of [[Everlund]], he became frustrated by the council's inaction following a mind flayer attack in the city that had claimed nearly 200 people, including his entire family. He then left the council and sought the [[Arcane (race)|arcane]] to purchase a ship that could pursue the illithids. During his search, Kyriel also encountered the other members of the new organization.

The Gauntlet became famous throughout [[Realmspace]] after destroying a largeneogi slave trading operation on an asteroid in the Tears of Selûne, which also engaged on humanoid traffic by mind flayers. The company attacked from orbit aboard the ''Gauntlet'' and destroyed all buildings on the asteroid, killing nearly all neogi and mind flayers present.

The surviving neogi and mind flayers managed to flee and alert the other members of their species about the attack. As a result, a bounty of over 100,000 [[gp]] was placed on the destruction of the company. In addition, the scattered neogi created numerous other trading posts throughout the Tears, with substantially reinforced security.

==Members==
The company was led by Kyriel. Its compliment also included three [[cleric]]s: [[Liasa]], [[Sunea]], and [[Kierie]]. Three [[wizard]]s took turns in operating the ''Gauntlet'''s [[spelljamming helm]]: [[Cambrigha]], [[Savion]], and [[Vom]]. They had six apprentices: [[Alekra]], [[Vicales]], [[Nogard]], [[Sarden]], [[Chare]], and [[Shardonel]]. Kyriel also had an apprentice called [[Ansalok]]. The seven apprentices were tasked with ship's maintenance and upkeep.

Despite internal bickering and occasional disagreements at times of peace, the members of the Gauntlet operated toghether in great harmony when it was time to fight.
