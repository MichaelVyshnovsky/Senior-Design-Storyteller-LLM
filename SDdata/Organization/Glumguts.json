        "mainbody": "he Glumguts were an extended family of dark ones&mdashpredominantly dark creepers&mdashthat operated in the Shadowfell city of Evernight as of the late 15 century DR.\nThe Glumguts were paid by the Empire of Netheril to maintain their Evernight consulate at the so-called dark creeper enclave. In practice, this simply meant receiving messages for the Netherese and ensuring that the consulate was a safe place for visiting shadovar. The Glumguts were not granted any formal authority under this relationship, and the Netherese would destroy them if they did anything that embarrassed or weakened Netherils interests in Evernight.\nTo supplement their income, the Glumguts engaged in banditry outside Evernights walls and along the Shadowfell Road, and would steal from any living visitors to the city.\nAs of , the Glumguts were led by a dark stalker known as Blackclaw, who was feared among their ranks for his cruelty.\nOther notable members included Blackclaws son, Blackcut, and his cousins, Thrax and Vynnia. These three were known to engage in pranks across Evernight, and were the only ones brave enough to test Blackclaws patience, largely because they believed that Blackcuts relationship with his father would protect them. As of 1479 DR, the three had engaged in acts that had worsened Netherils reputation in the city, but Blackclaw had not yet found out."
