        "mainbody": "The '''Garuk One Ears''' were a tribe of [[goblinoids]], [[orcs]], and [[ogres]] active in the [[Galena Mountains]] of [[Vaasa]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were easily recognized by the fact that every member was missing one ear.",
        "Organization": "The tribe was led by Garuk, an unusually large and intelligent [[goblin]] who offered to pay anyone who joined the tribe up-front and in [[gold]]. Goblins and orcs received one gold piece, [[bugbears]] received three or four, and ogres received five. Anyone who agreed to join had to first prove their commitment to Garuk by cutting off their left ear, and then to share a meal with the tribe in which the ears of new recruits were served in a soup.\n\nThe tribe was established in the {{YearlinkName|1359}} after construction on the Bloodstone Gates had begun following the defeat of [[Zhengyi the Witch-King]]. The combination of cash and savagery that the tribe advertised led it to become the fastest growing goblinoid faction in the [[Bloodstone Lands]].",
        "Activities": "In truth, the tribe was little more than a scam run by Garuk. The soup was actually made from local vermin, and was served to the tribe in order to conceal the fact that the severed ears were being smuggled out to [[Palischuk]]. From there, [[half-orc]] associates of Garuk laundered them through the [[Vaasan Gate]] to collect the generous bounties posted by King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] of [[Damara]]. Garuk then used half of these rewards to pay his new initiates and thus acquire their ears as well."
