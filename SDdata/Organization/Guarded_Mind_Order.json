Strict rules are in place to keep our order safe.''|[[Cyphus Ordinae]]}}",
        "Organization": "The Guarded Mind Order was known for its strict rules and teachings. The monks of the order were tasked with studying, witnessing, and recording. Their targets were individuals, races, regions, and wars. Members of the Guarded Mind Order were not allowed to participate or interfere in the events they were recording.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, a [[half-elven]] monk of the order, [[Cyphus Ordinae]], was observing the recent events transpiring in the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]]. He chronicled the series of assassinations performed by [[drow]], who seemingly started appearing from the mega-dungeon of [[Undermountain]]. Cyphus observed heroes being assembled by [[Durnan]] of the [[Yawning Portal]] and the events that followed."
