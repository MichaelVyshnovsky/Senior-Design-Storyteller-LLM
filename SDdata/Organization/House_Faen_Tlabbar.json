        "Description": "House Faen Tlabbar was based in a large castle of dark stone. It was one of the largest houses not on the plateau of [[Qu'ellarz'orl]]. It was located along the southern wall and had tall spires. It was defended by lizard-mounted guards who wielded crossbows and lances. However, the house had a blind spot in its connection to the roof.\n\nHouse Faen Tlabbar was protected by a spell of forbidding. Something that the guards wore allowed them passage. The doors of the house were made of pale [[zurkhwood]]. There was a large hall which included studies, parlors, and trophy rooms. The floor was shiny black marble. There was a shrine to [[Lolth]] at the end with a large double door; the shrine itself was a dome encrusted with gems. The chapel had a guardian demon resembling a skeleton covered in green flames with a flowing scimitar.",
        "Activities": "House Faen Tlabbar was considered to be one of the most fanatical of all the [[List of drow houses|drow houses]] of Menzoberranzan.",
        "History": {
            "Ranking": "In [[1297 DR]], Faen Tlabbar was the seventh house. They ascended to sixth after the destruction of [[House DeVir]]. By [[1328 DR]], thanks to the destruction of [[House Hun'ett]] and [[House Hrost Ulu'ar]], they had ascended to 4th. When [[House Oblodra]] was destroyed after the [[Time of Troubles]], they replaced them as 3rd but then, after the [[Spellplague]], [[House Xorlarrin]] became more powerful and took over as third house, forcing Faen Tlabbar back to fourth.<ref> In [[1484 DR]], House Faen Tlabbar retook their place as the third house after House Xorlarrin left the city for [[Q'Xorlarrin]]."
