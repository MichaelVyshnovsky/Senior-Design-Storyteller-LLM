        "mainbody": "ouse Faen Tlabbar was a drow house of Menzoberranzan.\nHouse Faen Tlabbar was based in a large castle of dark stone. It was one of the largest houses not on the plateau of Quellarzorl. It was located along the southern wall and had tall spires. It was defended by lizard-mounted guards who wielded crossbows and lances. However, the house had a blind spot in its connection to the roof.\nHouse Faen Tlabbar was protected by a spell of forbidding. Something that the guards wore allowed them passage. The doors of the house were made of pale zurkhwood. There was a large hall which included studies, parlors, and trophy rooms. The floor was shiny black marble. There was a shrine to Lolth at the end with a large double door the shrine itself was a dome encrusted with gems. The chapel had a guardian demon resembling a skeleton covered in green flames with a flowing scimitar.\nHouse Faen Tlabbar was considered to be one of the most fanatical of all the drow houses of Menzoberranzan.\nIn 1358 DR, Matron Mother Ghennitiroth Tlabbar was killed by Kyorl Odran.\nSome time prior to 1372 DR, the human sorceress and psionicist Smylla Nathos dwelt with House Faen Tlabbar. Smylla grew sick however and her hosts divine healing powers couldnt help her. They believed that this was a curse from Lolth and tried to have Smylla assassinated but the human survived. The House spread the rumor that they had grown tired of her novelty and cast her out to save face.\nTo secure an alliance with House Agrach Dyrr during the Silence of Lolth in 1372 DR, Nimor Imphraezl of the Jaezred Chaulssin snuck into the house chapel and slew both Matron Mother Ghenni Tlabbar and her daughter Silzet. The fifth daughter, Vadalma, was also present but survived and became the next matron mother.\nHouse Melarn tried to forge an alliance with House Faen Tlabbar due to the religious devotion of both Houses in 1480 DR. Such was Matron Vadalmas hatred for House Melarn however, that although she did not outright refuse their offer for political reasons, neither did she accept.\nIn 1297 DR, Faen Tlabbar was the seventh house. They ascended to sixth after the destruction of House DeVir. By 1328 DR, thanks to the destruction of House Hunett and House Hrost Uluar, they had ascended to 4th. When House Oblodra was destroyed after the Time of Troubles, they replaced them as 3rd but then, after the Spellplague, House Xorlarrin became more powerful and took over as third house, forcing Faen Tlabbar back to fourth. In 1484 DR, House Faen Tlabbar retook their place as the third house after House Xorlarrin left the city for QXorlarrin.\n* Finithey Tlabbar Adopted and favored by Ghennitiroth, killed in 1358 DR by Kyorl Odran\n* Ghenni Tlabbar Former matron, killed in 1372 DR by Nimor Imphraezl of the Jaezred Chaulssin.\n* Ghennitiroth Tlabbar Former matron mother, killed in 1358 DR by Kyorl Odran\n* Ghilanna Tlabbar Former matron until 1361 DR\n* Iyelle Tlabbar traitor priestess in 1479 DR\n* Luafae Tlabbar First Priestess in 1484 DR.\n* Malaggar Tlabbar First Sword of Melee Magthere\n* ModVensis Tlabbar Instructor at the Academy\n* PirOront Tlabbar Firstborn son of Ghennitiroth\n* Rinnill Tlabbar Patron of Ghennitiroth\n* Silzet Tlabbar Daughter of Ghenni, killed in 1372 DR by Nimor Imphraezl.\n* Thaerlbone Faen Tlabbar Renegade wizard\n* Thezz Tlabbar minor warrior in 1479 DR\n* Vadalma Tlabbar Matron mother in 1372 DR and 1484 DR, fifth daughter of Ghennitiroth.\n* Zilzmaer  House guard killed by Nimor Imphraezl in 1372 DR.\n* Kron Tlabbar House patron in 1488 DR.\n* Lia Faen Tlabbar A disgraced and exiled warlock of Zargon in the late 15 century DR."
