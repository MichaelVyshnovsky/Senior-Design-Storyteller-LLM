        "mainbody": "The Fellowship of Poetic Justices was an order of bards and crusaders who worshiped either Hoar, the Lord of Three Thunders, or Tyr, the Even-Handed.\nThe Fellowship of Poetic Justices was active throughout Faer√ªn.\nThe order was founded during the aftermath of the Time of Troubles. Members of this group sought to spread stories of ironic justice wherever they travelled, hoping to achieve through their tales what violence failed to accomplish. They were supported by clerics of both faiths."
