The Dark Wave was a small group of holy slayers that were operating out of Hawa in 1367 DR.
The Dark Wave served the Cult of Istishia, against their will. They carried out assassinations when ordered.
Hawa, on the island of the Genies Turban within the Corsair Domains, served as the base for the Dark Wave.
All members of the Dark Wave were under the influence of a ghul-kin named Faizah and her Waters of devotion.
The Dark Wave only had three members Setara bint Aasim, Shadha, and Sahlah.
