        "History": "The star people despised the [[drow]] and [[Crinti]] who dominated the country of Dambrath. The Dambraii sometimes hunted the Trunadar{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|60}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 49: The Road to Kh√¥ltar, Part 2}} and the star people would occasionally raid logging camps near [[Elveswatch]] and other settlements.",
        "Organization": "For over 300 years the Trunalor were led by [[Ferla Treerunner]], until at least the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]]. Their numbers hovered around 500 wild elves, causing them to chose their battles carefully to avoid unnecessary risk. Raiding parties of Trunalor would not attack an outside group found within the Forest of Amtar if that group had a full-blooded elf with them."
