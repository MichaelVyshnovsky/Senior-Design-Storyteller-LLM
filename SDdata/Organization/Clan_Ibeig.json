At the time, it had only two members, a couple of newlywed [[dragonborn]] who had retired from the [[Lance Defenders]] to live in the outskirts of [[Ruinspoke]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Taking Stock of the Situation|35}} They formed their clan in the hopes that their descendants would transform it into a true, prosperous farming clan.\n\nThe couple lived in a small, highly defensible farmstead that looked more like a military barracks than a farm, and they made a living selling eggs, fruits, and vegetables, and their popular peach jam to the merchants of Ruinspoke.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Old Enemies Arise|14}}\n\nThey were allies of [[Clan Jalt]]. In fact, members of that clan encouraged the young couple to found their own clan.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], the couple helped a band of [[adventurer]]s to deal with [[kobold]] problems in the vicinity.\n\nIn [[1480 DR]], the couple also helped adventurers to deal with Queen [[Sisay]]'s kobold army.",
