        "mainbody": "lan Ibeig was one of the dragonborn clans of the nation of Tymanther.\nClan Ibeig was a minor clan founded in 1476 DR. At the time, it had only two members, a couple of newlywed dragonborn who had retired from the Lance Defenders to live in the outskirts of Ruinspoke. They formed their clan in the hopes that their descendants would transform it into a true, prosperous farming clan.\nThe couple lived in a small, highly defensible farmstead that looked more like a military barracks than a farm, and they made a living selling eggs, fruits, and vegetables, and their popular peach jam to the merchants of Ruinspoke.\nThey were allies of Clan Jalt. In fact, members of that clan encouraged the young couple to found their own clan.\nIn 1479 DR, the couple helped a band of adventurers to deal with kobold problems in the vicinity.\nIn 1480 DR, the couple also helped adventurers to deal with Queen Sisays kobold army.\n* Ibeig Etoek, the male member of the clan.\n* Ibeig Simdet, the female member of the clan."
