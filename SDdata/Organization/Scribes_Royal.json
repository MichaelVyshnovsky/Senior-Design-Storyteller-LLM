        "mainbody": "'''Scribe Royal''', jokingly referred to as \"Royal Scribe\" by some of the members, was a clerical title and a life-long position under the Crown of [[Cormyr]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20211028234155/http://candlekeep.com/downloads/So_Saith_Ed_Part25_%282010-2016%29.zip| title = So Saith Ed 2010-2016| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}",
        "Organization": "All new scribes signed a pledge to the Crown as they started the job, making the position life-long with limited retirement. This meant that Scribes Royal received clothing, housing, and quality food until their deaths. Scribes of advanced age were relocated and cared for in the retirement home financed by the Crown. One such sprawling mansion was called [[Thornthar]], to the south of the farming town of [[Gray Oaks]]. In retirement, Scribes Royal stopped receiving pay but gained the status of the wards of the Crown.\n\nRoyal Scribes were also not allowed to seek employment anywhere else after signing the oath under the laws of the Forest Kingdom. Those Scribes Royal who covertly attempted to escape the country were hunted down by Cormyr's [[Highknight]]s and relieved the deserters of all and any official documents they might've liberated from Castle Obarskyr. Such Scribes Royal were under constant surveillance. If they were to accept employment under enemies or traitors of Cormyr, the assassination was the likely course of action.\n\nThe lowers ranks in the organization were held by underscribes who were employed on probation and not entrusted with sensitive nor secret materials. As the probation period ended and the order allowed underscribes to take the pledge, they became known as \"lifers.\"\n\n\"Scribe Royal\" was an honorific title as each member of the organization had a more precise personal title that captured their positions and responsibilities. The workload of the Scribes Royal kept the positions in operations twenty-four hours a day. As Undermasters of the Rolls worked, their supervisors â€“ Masters of the Rolls rested, and ''vice versa.'' The highest-ranking members were the Royal Overscribes.",
        "Base of Operations": "Members of the Scribe Royal were employed by the royal family of Cormyr, with their offices located within the [[Castle Obarskyr]] in the heart of [[Suzail]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1348}}, Scribes Royal Blaunel and Lathlan were the individuals who processed the adventuring charter for the \"Swords of Eveningstar,\" later famously known as the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]]. The charter was granted by the [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] as the reward to [[Florin Falconhand]] following the [[Battle of Hunter's Hollow]].",
        "Notable Members": "*Scribe Royal [[Amaundra Duthwood]], the Undermaster of the Coin Rolls, was a mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] record keeper in charge of taxation and administration. Both Amaundra and Blaunel served under the Masters of the Rolls.\n*Scribe Royal [[Blaunel]], the Undermaster of the Rolls, was a scribe employed by the Crown ''circa'' 1348 DR, placed in charge of keeping track and recording new and existing adventuring charters of the kingdom, as well as lists of citizens, addresses, jobs, and properties. This included guild rosters and various affiliations.\n*Royal Overscribe [[Aldegrand Tallfyre]], Dlara Highshield's successor who renamed the title to \"Royal High Scribe.\"\n*Royal Overscribe [[Dlara Highshield]], the highest ranking Scribe Royal in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR and a royal bastard of King [[Rhigaerd Obarskyr II]].\n*Scribe Royal [[Lathlan]], Privy Amaneunsis to the Queen, the personal letterer and decree written for [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]], the Queen of Cormyr, in charge of her correspondence, and maintaining archives of her official documents."
