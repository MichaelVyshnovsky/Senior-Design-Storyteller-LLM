Sarthuns Shield was band of adventurers that were in semi-retirement in Everlund, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
This group was made up of fourteen men and women that had given up the dangerous life of adventuring and had settled in Everlund to live out their remaining years.
Sarthuns Shield still knew how to make an impression and they bolstered their retirement funds by hiring themselves out for various low-risk jobs. They loved to don their shiny armor and help fill out a parade, or add pomp and dignity to a wedding or a funeral procession. They formed a phalanx of bodyguards or dressed as liveried staff for merchants that wanted to project an aura of importance. Their knowledge of Everlund made them quite useful when they were engaged to find a missing person, a runaway, stolen goods, or contraband.
The rogues in the group enjoyed turning the tables on unscrupulous merchants that came through town. They, and the rest of Sarthuns Shield, would set up a confidence scheme or a sting operation to relieve their targets of ill-gotten gains. The Missing Minotaur tavern in western Everlund provided just the right atmosphere to attract potential marks, so certain members kept their ears open or had informants that reported on the news from the Minotaur.
