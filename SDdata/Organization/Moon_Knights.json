        "classname": "moon knights",
        "mainbody": "The '''moon knights''' were [[specialty priest]]s of the [[Church of Selûne]] and members of a highly militant order of soldier-priests devoted to [[Selûne|the Moonmaiden]].",
        "History": "Selûne ordered the establishment of the moon knights in response to hostility by her sister [[Shar]]. They were active by [[1369 DR]].",
        "Attitudes": "The moon knights were joyous and good humored when celebrating, but they fostered a deep hatred of the goddess Shar and her [[church of Shar|faithful]], reacting with rage and even bloodlust whenever they encountered them.",
        "Activities": "Supplementing the [[crusader]]s of the Selûnite church, the moon knights were charged with defending the church against threats from Shar and even to take the fight to the Sharrans directly.",
        "Abilities": "The moon knights were intimately linked to the goddess and her divine power, such that their abilities waxed and waned with the [[Selûne (moon)|moon]]<ref group=\"note\">Given the close similarity and association with the Selûnite faith, this is assumed to be lunar magic. During the full moon, three days each month, a moon knight became generally more capable and could [[turn undead]] with more force. However, during the new moon, three days each month, a moon knight was generally less capable and could not turn [[undead]] at all. Moreover, a [[lycanthrope]] moon knight had a better chance of controlling themselves, both during the full moon and in their beast forms.\n\nIn addition, a moon knight was unable to cast [[spell]]s or even use [[magic item]]s that produced darkness. Nevertheless, they trained to fight in the dark and while blinded, to counter Sharran tactics.\n\nSome learned the skills of navigation.",
        "Possessions": "The moon knights uniformly wore [[Splint mail|splint armor]] colored silver and white with the two eyes of the goddess emblazoned across the chest, together with a helmet with a blue crest and a cloak of midnight blue. They preferred the [[Moon's Hand|moon's hand]] [[mace]] favored by the church."
