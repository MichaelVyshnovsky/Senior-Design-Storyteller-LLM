        "mainbody": "The '''Firestorm Cabal''' was a loosely organized organization of [[genasi]] with chapters in [[Airspur]], [[Calimport]] and [[Memnon]].",
        "Membership": "The Firestorm Cabal was made up mostly by genasi. While the Airspur chapter had a few non-genasi members, the [[Calimshan]] chapters were open to only genasi.",
        "Activities": "The Airspur chapter was made up by scouts, mercenaries, and freebooters sworn by their leaders to protect [[Akanûl]], and they helped to protect the borders of Akanûl from many threats, although most of them often acted more as outlaws and villains. The Airspur chapter was often employed by Queen [[Arathane]] to do her dirty work for her. The organization was disliked by many of the upper classes in Airspur but was viewed favorably by the lower classes, who see them as heroes.{{Cite dragon/377/Explore Airspur|65}}\n\nThe Airspur chapter was also involved in other activities, such as the research of [[wild magic]]. This research was not limited to the common energies studied by other spellcasters, such as those of the [[Elemental Chaos]], however. The [[sorcerer]]s of the Firestorm Cabal also studied the energies of the [[Spellplague]], something punished by death penalty in Akanûl.\n\nThe [[Calimshan]] chapters were more interested in maintaining the purity of genasi souls. That is, they wanted to prevent airsoul and firesoul genasi from mixing with genasi of other manifestations.",
        "Headquarters": "The Firesstorm Cabal had many safehouses in AkanÛl. The most important one was the Motherhouse, in Airspur, were the leaders of the Cabal met when not in the field, and the new recruits were trained.{{Cite dragon/377/Explore Airspur|66}}",
        "History": "The Firestorm Cabal was founded in [[Calimshan]] and the organization later expanded into Airspur. Cabal members were among the first to take up arms during the [[Second Era of Skyfire]].\n\nIn [[1479 DR]] the Airspur chapter was infiltrated by the [[Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye]].  The cult's leader ([[Murmur]]) possessed a high ranking officer while she was sleeping and recruited many low-ranking members of the cabal into the cult.  Many of the recruits believed the cult was actually part of the cabal and that by joining the cult they were being initiated into a higher order of the cabal.  The Cult of the Elder Elemental Eye was eventually destroyed by [[Demascus]] and the cabal survived the incident although its headquarters building was destroyed.\t\n\nThat same year, members of a frontier cell of the Firestorm Cabal in Akanûl helped the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] to hunt and kill the [[Fang dragon|gray dragon]] [[Vairshekellabex]].",
