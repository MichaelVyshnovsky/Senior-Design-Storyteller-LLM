The '''Welcomers''', also called the '''Welcoming Committee''', was the lone thieves' guild in [[Phlan]] as of [[1367 DR]].

Most of the natives of Phlan knew the guildmembers by sight, perhaps because of their overt operations or their unique self-mutilation, prompting the guild to mostly target visitors to the city and adopt their sarcastic guild name.

==Members==
Members of the Welcomers notoriously cut off their left ear to prove their loyalty to the guild.

==Activities==
Though not officially sanctioned, the guild was allowed to exist because of their usefulness as scouts and defenders of Phlan during the past.
