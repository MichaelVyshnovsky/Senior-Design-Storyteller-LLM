The '''Mulan Dynasty''' ruled over the city-state of [[Westgate]] from the {{YearlinkName|-27}}, until {{YearlinkName|75}}. Their reign began when [[Ashtukzu I]] ousted the [[doppleganger]] posing as [[Ryndarth Soleilon II]] and claimed the throne for himself. The dynasty was named for their [[mulan]] heritage.
