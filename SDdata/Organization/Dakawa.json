        "History": "During a great drought the Dakawa ventured to the oasis at the bases of [[El Rahalat]] mountain. There they encountered its namesake resident, the exiled [[sorceress]] [[Rahalat]] and slew her in order to claim the land as their own.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Bedine legend stated the springs of the oasis turned to blood for a decade after Rahalat's death. Thereafter, any tribe staying at El Rahalat sacrificed a [[camel]] to Rahalat in order to keep the water pure."
