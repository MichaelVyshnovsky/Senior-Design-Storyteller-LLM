        "mainbody": "The Dakawa was a tribe of the Bedine people that lived in the sands of the Anauroch desert.\nDuring a great drought the Dakawa ventured to the oasis at the bases of El Rahalat mountain. There they encountered its namesake resident, the exiled sorceress Rahalat and slew her in order to claim the land as their own.\nBedine legend stated the springs of the oasis turned to blood for a decade after Rahalats death. Thereafter, any tribe staying at El Rahalat sacrificed a camel to Rahalat in order to keep the water pure."
