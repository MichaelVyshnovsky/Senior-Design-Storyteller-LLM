The Devoted Mamluk Society, also known as the Devoted, was a military organization in Zakhara.
The Devoted and Exalted were bitter rivals, leading to frequent conflicts in the region of the Cities of the Pantheon.
The Devoted were led by Amahl Abd al-Muhlis, the Most Respected Warrior.
The Devoted were scattered through the Cities of the Pantheon, but their strongest presence was within Itiraf and Fahhas.
