The '''Band of the Key''' was a band of dedicated occultist fighters who operated in [[Faer√ªn]] sometime before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Some years before the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, the infamous Band of the Key was led by a lanky man named [[Heglyf]]. They hunted down [[book]]s of evil [[:Category:Arcane books (in-universe)|arcane knowledge]] and removed them from the hands of those who might misuse such items. As Heglyf's group preferred to strike from the shadows using [[crossbow]]s, he commissioned the creation of brightly-decorated [[enchanted]] ''[[tranquil bolt]]s'' from [[Deneir]]ian [[priest]]s.
