        "mainbody": "'''Those Who Sleep Below''' were a group of mysterious and malevolent ever diligently being watched over by the [[Triton Protectorates]] of the Inner Sea, who prevented anyone from accessing the Trench. The [[triton]]s were very unforthcoming on the matter, admitting only that they watched against \"Those Who Sleep Below\" and that their guardianship was some sacred duty.",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Dagon]] was the one known member of Those Who Sleep Below and the eldest among them.",
        "Worship": "Many among the [[kuo-toa]] and [[morkoth]] believed these entities to be the dark gods of their ancient myths. The early morkoth theocracies in particular believed their gods to be asleep within the Trench of Lopok and that only fervent prayer could one day awaken them. Outside of these beliefs, some legends claimed that the Trench of Lopok was allegedly where both races arose.\n\nThey were directly served and worshiped by some [[kraken]]s{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|59}} and morkoths.{{Cite dungeon/79/The Akriloth|72}}",
        "History": "In {{YearlinkConvert|-1453|TS}}, [[Kyron]] the deposed king of [[Thalorlyn]] along with his exiled loyalists sought to create a new center of power for himself. Having been driven mad years ago by the whispers of Dagon, he and his loyalists constructed the temple of [[Vynagyr]] along the slopes of the [[Nalaan Plateau]] and dedicated it to Those Who Sleep Below.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"dagon\">In the original text the temple is referred to as being dedicated to \"long forgotten evil powers\". With Dagon retconned in ''Grand History of the Realms'' as a member of Those Who Sleep Below and as the reason behind Kyron's madness, it retroactively suggests that the temple is dedicated to them.\n\nSometime in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Those Who Sleep Below commanded their devout kraken servant [[Qol'in'taroq]], along with his morkoth ally [[Vlantir]], to take over the abandoned city of [[Voalidru]] for unknown reasons. They only specified that they wished to prevent Voalidru's former [[merfolk]] citizenry from ever reclaiming it and its many treasures."
