The '''House of Tholaunt''' was the name given to the priesthood of [[Tholaunt]]â€”how the [[god]] [[Osiris]] was called in [[Thoth]].

==History==
As with all organizations of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]], positions of power within the priesthood were typically hereditary and most [[priest]]s were descendants of various [[incarnation]]s of their god.
