The '''Platinum Cadre''' was an order of [[dragonborn]] [[knight]]s, [[paladin]]s and [[priest]]s from [[Tymanther]] sworn to the service of [[Bahamut]].

==Headquarters==
The main headquarters of the Platinum Cadre were located in an abandoned section of the [[Catacombs (Djerad Thymar)|Catacombs]] of [[Djerad Thymar]]. They also had an office in Lord [[Jalt Tuanek|Tuanek]]'s manor in [[Ruinspoke]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Hand of Darkness|37}}

==Activities==
The Platinum Cadre professed that dragonborn weren't the creations of the dragons of [[Abeir]], but instead were the ancient children of the dragon god Bahamut. As such, members of this group believed that not all dragons were evil, and actively worked to change the prejudices of the Thymari dragonborn while seeking out for [[Metallic dragon|good dragons]], in hopes of bridging the divide between them and the dragonborn.

Even when most of the Thymari dragonborn ridiculed the Platinum Cadre for their beliefs, in fact their members were close to truth, as the dragonborn of Abeir were actually related to the ancient [[dragonborn of Bahamut]], although only a few older dragons knew about this relationship.{{cite web|author=[[Ed Greenwood]]|title=Ed's Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/722271292758585344|accessdate=2016-04-18}}

The Platinum Cadre also had a foothold in the village of Ruinspoke, where they were accepted by the populace and could act openly without fear of reprisal, thanks to their allegiance to [[Clan Jalt]].

==History==
In [[1479 DR]], a [[priest]]ess of the order named [[Nala]] claimed to be a priestess of Bahamut but was secretly a priestess of [[Tiamat]]. Because most dragonborn knew little about the gods of [[Toril]], they were unable to distinguish the [[magic]] of Tiamat from that of Bahamut. Nala was working for the [[green dragon]] [[Skuthosiin]], and her goal was to advance the plan of her master as a ''taaldarax'' of [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s ''[[xorvintaal]]'' by using the Cadre to his benefit.

Tiamat's power enabled the knights to use their breath abilities more often than other dragonborn,

The Platinum Cadre took part on [[Vanquisher]] [[Kepeshkmolik Tarhun]] joint military operation against the giants on [[Kythorn 9]]. Although Nala didn't wanted them to attack at the same time the other Thymari military forces did it, because she was using magic to hinder the military effort, [[Daardendrien Balasar|Balasar]] (a member of the Lance Defenders who became suspicious of Nala and infiltrated the Cadre to uncover her true motives) was able to convince his "brothers-in-arms" to join the fray, to her annoyment. The joined Thymari forces were able to drive the giants off their lands.

After having uncovered some hints, Balasar exposed Nala as a tiamatan on [[Kythorn 16]] and she fled to the [[Black Ash Plain]] and sought refuge with Skuthosiin. [[Patrin]], a paladin of Bahamut and the leader of the order, was killed in a duel of honor with [[Daardendrien Medrash|Medrash]], a paladin of [[Torm]], when Patrin refused to acknowledge that Nala was really evil. After Patrin's death, a knight named [[Vishva]] took the leadership of the order. She convinced Medrash to cleanse the members of the Cadre of Tiamat power.

Nala's treachery stained what reputation the members of the Cadre may have won in the past operations, and they became victims of ostracism and open acts of violence. They respected Patrin's last wishes and didn't fight back, however. Although rejected, they still wanted to participate in the operation to invade the Black Ash Plain. During the siege of [[Ashhold]] on [[Flamerule 5]], they were put under the command of [[Khouryn Skulldark]] of the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]].

When Khouryn Skulldark returned to Tymanther and warned them about [[Tchazzar]]'s plans to invade the dragonborn nation, Tarhun made Medrash the official leader of the Cadre, and sent them, alongside Balasar, [[Kanjentellequor Biri|Biri]] and Khouryn, on a mission to destroy [[Gestaniius]] and liberate [[High Imaskar]] from her forces, in the hopes the Imaskari would lend their aid to the Thymari.

After the [[Battle of Luthcheq]], Medrash became the protector of the Platinum Cadre, to ensure the Thymari didn't forget that the Cadre had fought and saved their country. Albeit reluctantly, the Cadre was acknowledged as one the best military forces Tymanther had to offer.

In the late years of the [[1480 DR|1480s DR]], the Platinum Cadre had slowly been accepted among Thymari society, to the point that some of the most old-fashioned and influential clans, such as [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh]], employed the services of the Cadre's priests.
