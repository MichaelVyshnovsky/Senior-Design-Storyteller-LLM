        "mainbody": "The '''Marsember Watch''', also called the '''City Watch''' or '''the Watch''', was the local constabulary of [[Marsember]],  an organization of city guards that protected the [[Cormyr]]ian city and its economic interests. While they were charged with the city's protections, many of their members were considered to be corrupt and thuggish. Each of its members was called a Watchman, or Watchmen for plural.",
        "Organization": "The watch had a military-like hierarchy, with ranks similar to [[Purple Dragons#Ranks|those used]] in the [[Purple Dragons]], such as topsword, blademaster, oversword, constal, and lord marshall. Only officers of the Watch were permitted to take families and live in their own homes.",
        "Activities": "{{Quote|\"I'm sure Kleef does his best,\" Arietta said. \"But the Watch is filled with drunkards and cowards. It's a wonder they arrived to fight at all.\"}}\nMany watchmen regularly accepted bribes, particularly when offered by the city's mercantile interests. It also provided watchmen with Watch flans, which were [[steel]] meal tokens they could use to buy the cooperation of the hungry by letting them obtain a free full meal from the [[King's Tower]] in Marsember.<ref> The thump from a body hitting the floor was a common sound in any Watch barracks, where the residents often returned too drunk to find their beds.<ref>\n\nBesides the sword, a majority of watchmen favored the [[halberd]]<ref> with an auxiliary [[short sword]].",
        "Relationships": "The group had a contentious though not outwardly hostile relationship with Cormyr's [[Purple Dragons]].",
        "History": "The Watch was founded some time after [[1386 DR]] as a private militia for the merchant's guild of Marsember. They were originally tasked with providing interference between the merchants and the local contingent of the Purple Dragons. and the Marsemban Kenric family, a long line of [[Helm|Helmites]], spent three generations trying to purge the Watch of corruption and bring Helm's Law of Service to their fellow watchmen. They joined when they were of age.\n\n[[Ilgrim Marduth]] became Lord Marshall of the Watch a [[tenday]] after [[Taggar Kenric]] died.\n\nWhen their city was evacuated on [[Uktar 2]] of the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, watchmen under the command of Topsword [[Kleef Kenric]] cleared out [[Wilhastle Square]],\n\nOn the same day, Kleef's own men majority volunteered to follow him, the [[chosen]] [[Joelle Emmeline]] and [[Malik el Sami]], and [[Arietta Seasilver]] with her guards onto [[Falrinn Greatorm|Falrinn Greatorm's]] ''[[Lonely Roamer]]'' to rescue [[Elira Seasilver]] from the ''[[Wave Wyvern]]'' commandeered by [[Yder Tanthul]]. It took two [[Tenday|tendays]] of sailing to succeed the mission, but of the accompanied watchmen, only [[Jang]] and [[Kleef Kenric]] who boarded the ''Wave Wyvern'' survived as others jump ship while the ''Lonely Roamer'' sank from the attack by Yder's [[leviathan (disambiguation)|leviathan]] and surrounded by an underwater [[Sea serpent|serpent]].",
        "Members": "* [[Ilgrim Marduth]], Lord Marshall of the Watch ''circa'' 1486 DR.\n* [[Taggar Kenric]], a constal and follower of Helm.\n* [[Kleef Kenric]], a topsword and [[chosen]] of Helm.\n* [[Tanner]], a large guardsman under Kleef. He was presumed deceased on [[Uktar 22]] in 1486 DR after he jumped ship, when the ''[[Lonely Roamer]]'' was sanked by Yder's sea monster.\n* [[Jang]], Kleef's first blade and best friend, from [[Marsember/Xiousing|Xiousing]].<ref> He assisted the escort of Grand Duchess [[Elira Seasilver]] to [[Westgate]] on the ''[[Wave Wyvern]]''.\n* [[Rathul]], the oldest guardsman under Kleef. He died at the [[Shadovar|Shadovar's]] assassination on the first moonset boarding the ''Lonely Roamer''.<ref>\n* [[Ardul]], a young guardsman under Kleef. He was presumed deceased on [[Uktar 22]] in 1486 DR after the ''Lonely Roamer'' was sanked and a [[Sea serpent|serpent]] roamed the waters."
