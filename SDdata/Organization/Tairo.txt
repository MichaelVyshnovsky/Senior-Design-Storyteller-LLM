The '''tairo''' were the Great Elders of [[Wa]], the highest office of the shogunate.

==Organization==
There were between three and five tairo at any given time. They were selected from among the [[fudai daimyo]], the so-called "house daimyo" who were most loyal to the shogun. This was a very honored role in Wa society, and to hold the position, one must havre owned property equivalent to at leaat 100,000 [[koku]] of [[rice]]. Whenever a new Great Elder was needed, he was selected and approved by the shogun.

==Activities==
The primary role of the roju was to directly advise the shogun in all important issues, including the creation of new laws for the nation. The tairo also oversaw the activities of the major daimyo.
