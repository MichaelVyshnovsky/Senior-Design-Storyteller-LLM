Clangeddins Hearth was a dwarven organization founded by the survivors of Clan Melairkyn and worshipers of Clangeddin Silverbeard in the mid-14 century DR.
Clangeddins Hearth was created with a quest to take back holy sites of Clangeddin Silverbeard, which was part of the ancient home of Clan Melairkyn, lost to the drow, time, and dangers of Undermountain circa 211 DR.
Clangeddins Hearth was established shortly before 1369 DR, and the dwarves started retaking the temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard in Undermountain following the disappearance of Halaster Blackcloak during Halasters Higharvestide. Dwarves were not the only ones who seized the opportunity, as the drow led by the High Priestess of Lolth, Azurna, returned to Undermountain during the same time, building alliances with evil beings of the dungeon and plotting to destroy Waterdeep via the legendary Flame Sword of Lolth. The artifact dated back to the War of the Seldarine and was staked from the Spider Queen and hidden in Undermountain.
The presence of the two old enemies brought on many conflicts between the factions. In 1370 DR, the drow were very close to reclaiming the powerful holy artifacts of Lolth and were on edge. They forced a kobold tribe out from the depths of Undermountain and positioned them close to the entrance to the dungeon in the sewers. There the dwarves of Clangeddins Hearth attempted to flush the dangerous pests by flooding the tunnels. The dwarf Kolrathanin was responsible for the attempt, not knowing that the drow valued the kobolds as their eyes on the dungeons entrance. Furious, Azurna sent her forces to slaughter the dwarves in the temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard. She entrusted the once more ruined temple to her lich ally who hated Clangeddin and his followers in exchange for the temple, Azurna wanted the lich to find a hidden piece of a magical stone spider she needed to unlock the Flame Swords power.
Most members of Clangeddins Hearth were raised as Morik Stormhands undead slaves, although at least one dwarf escaped the slaughter. Urkantor was locked away in the ancient prison of Clan Melairkyn that was occupied by the marauders of Horazak, allied with Azurna. The orc leader planned on sending the dwarf to Azurna, per her demand, as her personal slave and entertainment. Urkantor was freed by the Khelbenite who was attempting to stop the drow plot against the City of Splendors.
