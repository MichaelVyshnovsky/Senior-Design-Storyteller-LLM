        "Base of Operations": "The [[College of War Wizards]] in [[Suzail]] was the seat of power for the Royal Magician.\n\nThe war wizards took posts stationed all across [[Faerûn]]. As of the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, around 90 of their members lived in Suzail, with another 20 or so in [[Marsember]]. Some 15 years later, [[Castle Crag]] kept five War Wizards within its walls.",
        "Possessions": "Many war wizards wore ''[[War Wizard cloak|magical cloaks]]'' that were unique to their order. These were occasionally also gifted to certain [[nobility of Cormyr|Cormyrean nobles]] or select agents of the crown.\n\nAlong with members of the Cormyrean royal family, some important figures such as the [[Purple Dragon knight]]s and officers were given rings that were magically connected to the War Wizards. These rings allowed the wizards to ''[[scry]]'' and ''[[teleport]]'' to their locations, and respond to any threat, nearly as quickly as the ring was removed.",
        "Relationships": "During the early years of the kingdom, the War Wizards were indistinguishable from the Cormyrean [[Council of Mages]]. By the [[Era of Upheaval]], the two spellcasting bodies had clearly defined duties, though they greatly benefited from each others' expertise.",
        "History": "{{Quote|''The War Wizards are a lot of busybodies who think that because they're wizards, they have the right to poke their snouts into everything that passes under the sun.''|[[Kern Desanea]]}}<br/>\nPowerful wizards in Cormyr have had a storied history, one that was nearly as old as the kingdom itself. The first Cormyrean Council of Mages was called around the {{YearlinkName|70}}, when the kingdom was being threatened by monsters from the [[King's Forest]]. [[Baerauble Etharr]] earned the position as the first Royal Magician and gathered forth all the local wizards to deal with the menacing creatures. This first group of wizard-defenders came to be known as the War Wizards.{{Cite dragon/307/Heroes of Cormyr: Adventuring in the Forest Kingdom|48}}{{Cite dragon/307/Heroes of Cormyr: Adventuring in the Forest Kingdom|49}}\n\nThe organizations experienced a great schism in the {{YearlinkName|1248}}, when [[Salember Obarskyr|Regent Salmber]] plotted to kill his six–year–old nephew [[Rhigaerd Obarskyr II]], who was heir to the throne. When the sitting Royal Magician [[Jorunhast]] made the order to kill the young king–in–waiting, he was exiled and the title of Royal Magician was dissolved. As a whole, the War Wizards were stripped of much of their power and prestige they enjoyed.\n\n[[File:War Wizard.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A war wizard battling a warrior of the Tuigan Horde.'']]\nThe War Wizards were instrumental in turning back the invading [[Grand Army of the Tuigan]], which threatened the eastern realms of [[Faerûn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}.<ref><ref>\n\nIn fall of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the War Wizards were tasked with dealing with the [[Dusk Lord's Passage]], a ''[[portal]]'' that connected the [[Lost Refuge]] to the [[Plane of Shadow]].\n\nAround a third of the War Wizards were either killed or driven mad when the [[Spellplague]] ravaged [[Toril]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}.{{Cite dragon/362/Countdown to the Realms: Spellplague: The Wailing Years}} Following that tragedy, surviving wizards dedicated themselves to protecting their nation from the impending threat of the returned [[Netheril|Empire of Netheril]].\n\nSome time shortly before the {{YearlinkName|1449}}, [[Azoun Obarskyr V|King Azoun V]] passed the [[Suzail Writ]], a legal document which in part greatly limited the powers given to the War Wizards to magically monitor the activities of the Cormyrean citizenry, as they were known to do historically. After some disastrous attempts at [[Mind ream|mind-reaming]], resulting in the messy deaths of the nobles affected and the feeblemindedness of the War Wizards involved, the crown went as far as banning the use of the practice on any Cormyrean citizen, under penalty of death.\n\nNevertheless, the War Wizards still attempted to spy on all, even on themselves, despite the fact that their methods were now less intrusive, and as a result, less effective.",
        "Members": "Many recruits were selected from among the children who petitioned to study within the organization. Those who received the honor of an invitation to the [[War Wizard Academy]],{{Cite dragon/407/Character Themes: Heroes of Cormyr|4}} were selected for their true genuine motive, demonstration of new and useful spells, or their ability to serve as an apprentice.{{Cite dragon/407/Character Themes: Heroes of Cormyr|17}} \n\nNot all prospective members were recruited from a young age however. Some soldiers of the [[Purple Dragons]] found they had what it took to join the ranks of the War Wizards. While many of these spellcasters studied as [[wizard]]s, some of them possessed [[sorcerous]] powers, while others followed [[bard]]ic traditions.\n\nIf selected, a recruit became the apprentice of an established War Wizard, a position a high honor. Training to become a war wizard, took five years. During any five-year period about half the candidates dropped out due to the high standards they were expected to meet. \n\n[[Stormhaven House (Espar)|Stormhaven House]] was a secret training academy for novice War Wizards \n\nOnce the five years of training were successfully completed, the candidate earned the title of \"battlemage\".{{Cite dragon/407/Character Themes: Heroes of Cormyr|16-17}} They signed a legal agreement that bore the name of the king and pledged to serve the kingdom by the oath of the ''Handlfame'', under pain of ''[[geas]]''. \n\nSome of these requested sabbaticals in order to travel the world and study magic in greater depth. Many of them sought to bring back knowledge that would strengthen the organization.",
        "Notable War Wizards": "*[[Aundable Inthré]], one of the War Wizards who ''[[scried]]'' over Cormyr by means of a [[crystal ball]].\n*[[Dwenthor of the Winds]], a deserter who spent some time in hiding not far from the hamlet of [[Liam's Hold]], sometime before [[1372 DR]].\n*[[Foril Obarskyr I]], King of Cormyr during the mid–15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|44}}\n*[[Landraul Skatterhawk]], a 8{{th}} century war wizard who was present at both the [[battle of Snowsblood Trail]] and the [[battle of Standing Stone's Blood]].\n*[[Laspeera]], the second-in-command of the War Wizards through most of Vangerdahast's tenure and all of Caladnei's.\n*[[Valantha Shimmerstar]], the talented and charming mage-entertained who was quite popular at any grand Cormyrean celebration.\n*[[Maxer Hlarr]], honored by the crown for defending Suzail from no less than four [[dragon]]s.",
