The '''Ju'ur Dai''' was one of the tribes of the [[Bedine]] people that dwelled within the sands of [[Anauroch]] during the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
In an act of betrayal against their fellow tribesmen, the Ju'ur Dai aligned themselves with the [[Zhentarim]] during the mercenary organization's attempt to take by force a stretch of land across Anauroch.

==History==
Ja'ur Dai accompanied [[Sabkhat el Talab]]{{Cite Polyhedron UK/1/Just Deserts}}

When the Zhentarim began manipulating and even assailing the Bedine tribes in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, the Ju'ur Dai was the only tribe that did not unify under the common cause of maintaining their freedom from foreign influence. They even shared with the Zhent agents the secret location of [[Elah'zad]], the oasis that was home to a [[Elah'zad (temple)|sacred temple]] of the Bedine.

In an act even more foul, the Ju'ur Dai aided the Zhents in the [[poison]]ing of a Bedine oasis and their fellow tribesmen. The Ju'ur Dai faced justice in the end, however, as they were butchered by the Zhentarim at the ruined city of [[Orofin]], after they were no longer needed by the malevolent outlanders.
