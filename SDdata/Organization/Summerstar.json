        "Description": "The Summerstars were considered a backwater family in [[Suzail]]. Their heraldry was an arc of three golden stars on a field of deep blue.\n\nThe Summerstar family had a seat in [[Firefall Keep]], in [[Firefall Vale]], where the [[Hullack Forest]] met the western slopes of the [[Thunder Peaks]], in the Northtrees March district. The castle of Firefall Keep was at the western end of Firefall Vale, but it was virtually destroyed and most of its inhabitants were killed in [[1365 DR]]. [[Turnwyrm Brook]] flowed down the heart of vale to join the [[Immerflow]].",
