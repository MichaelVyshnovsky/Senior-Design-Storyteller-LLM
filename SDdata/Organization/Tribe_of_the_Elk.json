        "mainbody": "The '''Tribe of the Elk''' was a nomadic group of [[Reghedman]] [[barbarians]] that dwelled within the tundra of [[Icewind Dale]]. They lived a relatively peaceful life, in harmony with the folks of the nearby [[Ten Towns]].",
        "Culture": "Like other Reghedmen tribes, the Tribe of the Elk lived a largely nomadic life, chasing migrations of animals across the tundra. Historically, they have also settled in civilized towns and settlements of the North.",
        "History": "After the [[Battle of Icewind Dale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1351}}, few members were left and the women of the tribe were forced to scavenge for food on the tundra. [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] occasionally left slain [[reindeer]] where the tribe could find them.\n\nWulfgar assumed control of the tribes and convinced them to join forces with the men of Ten-Towns against the army of [[Akar Kessel]], wielder of the [[Crenshinibon]]. Together, the allied forces were victorious over the dark [[wizard]].\n\nAfter the battle, the Reghedmen tribes split into two groups. Some remained in Icewind Dale, led by [[Revjak]] from [[Caer-Konig]], while the other group followed Wulfgar to [[Settlestone]]. Originally built by the dwarves over two hundred years before, the Reghedmen rebuilt and lived a prosperous life as traders and merchants for the dwarves.<ref>\n\nEventually, [[Berkthgar]] became the new leader of the tribe after the death of his predecessor during the war with the [[drow]]. He decided that the barbarians would return to their old way of life on the tundra.\n\nAfter the death of [[Kierstaad the Swift]], Wulfgar's son [[Bruenorson]] became chieftain of the tribe. He went on to rule for at least a decade during the late 14{{th}} century.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the Tribe of the Elk had been led by [[Jarund Elkhardt]] for two decades. Under his rule the tribe cared little for the Ten Towns and lived in peace with its citizens.",
