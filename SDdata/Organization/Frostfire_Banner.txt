The '''Frostfire Banner''' was an [[adventuring party]] active in the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The hireswords had been in service to lords from [[Tethyr]], but for different reasons had been unable to continue. They'd since moved east, as a band of adventurers. The band met its end in the {{yearlinkName|767}}, when they took a commission from High Duke [[Horostos]], of [[Langalos]], to search the forests west of [[Starmantle]] for [[Saeraede Lyonora|The Slayer]]. The entity ambushed them at night instead, and slew them all.

==Members==
The Frostfire Banner had ten members. They were:
* [[Arvas]] or Avras, a warrior;
* [[Faldast]];
* [[Paeregur Amaethur Donlas]], also a warrior;
* [[Rolian]];
* [[Phostral]], a notably large warrior;
* [[Lhaerand]], A mage;
* One more mage;
* A [[halfling]], not Rolian;
* One priest serving [[Tymora]]; and
* One other priest
