The Faithful Mamluk Society, also known as the Faithful, was a military organization in Zakhara.
The Faithful represented one of the more powerful mamluk societies in Qudra. In addition to their duties in Qudra, they loyally served the Grand Caliph in golden Huzuz.
The Faithful were led by General Adun Abd al-Amin.
Most of the mamluks of the Faithful lived and worked in Qudra, but a strong presence was maintained in Huzuz as well.
