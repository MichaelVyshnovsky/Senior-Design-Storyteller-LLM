        "History": "As of the {{YearlinkName|1300}}, [[Halgren Death's Head]] embarked on a quest to earn coin to fix his family's reputation. He was a strong warrior whose bloodline was seemingly tainted by his rumored [[duergar]] ancestor and a criminal named [[Kaervas]]. In the city of [[Luskan]], Halgren assembled an adventuring mercenary company he named the [[Annals of Halgren]] in order to uplift the name of his clan with fame and treasures.\n\nIn [[1374 DR]], the dwarves of the Bruenghor Clan were driven out of their mines by [[drow]], who were led by the [[priestess]] [[Ilivarra]]. The clan quickly collapsed the entrances of the mine and escaped to the surface. The leader of the clan, [[Kolgrim]], assembled a force and gathered the equipment needed to light the signal tower atop Mount [[Burning Eye]], to alert the dwarves of [[Easting]]. However, his group (included the member with the key to the mines) were assailed by the [[ice dragon]], [[Ciraxis]], and a legion of [[ogres]]. Many were brutally slain and frozen to death, but Kolgrim managed to escape to a nearby ice cave.\n\nSoon after, a trio of adventurers ([[Vahn]], [[Adrianna]], and [[Kromlech Bruenghor]] who was also a member of the clan) arrived. They met with Kolgrim, who was beyond healing, and he told them to light the signal fire. The three adventurers were successful, and even acquired the key to the mines. Here, they slew Ilivarra, and the threat to the clan was ended.",
