        "mainbody": "The Vigilant Eyes of the God was an order of the paladins of Helm that sought out evil that threatened innocent lives, and insinuated themselves as a bulwark of protection. They possessed a sterling reputation among the citizens of Faer√ªn, who saw the knights as exemplars of benevolence.\nThe order was formed sometime around the mid-to-late 14 century DR. Its ranks swelled greatly following the atrocious slaughter of natives, at the hands of the Companions of the One True Vision, on the continent of Maztica. As many of the Companions were wracked with guilt and sought penance for their crimes, the church of Helm encouraged them to join the Vigilant Eyes."
