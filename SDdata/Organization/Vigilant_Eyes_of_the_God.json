        "mainbody": "The '''Vigilant Eyes of the God''' was an order of the [[paladins]] of [[Helm]] that sought out evil that threatened innocent lives, and insinuated themselves as a bulwark of protection. They possessed a sterling reputation among the citizens of [[Faer√ªn]], who saw the knights as exemplars of benevolence.",
        "Background": "The order was formed sometime around the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Its ranks swelled greatly following the atrocious slaughter of natives, at the hands of the [[Companions of the One True Vision]], on the continent of [[Maztica]]. As many of the Companions were wracked with guilt and sought penance for their crimes, the [[church of Helm]] encouraged them to join the Vigilant Eyes."
