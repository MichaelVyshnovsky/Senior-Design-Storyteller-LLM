        "Organization": "Roughly 4,000 Nar comprised the Abordabe, making them the largest tribe found within Narfell.",
        "Activities": "Perhaps because of their vast numbers, the Abordabe oversaw the [[Trade Fair]] on a yearly basis.\n\nContrary to many of the tribes scattered throughout Narfell, the Abordabe viewed outsiders as a potential source of wealth, making them more willing to trade instead of attack on sight.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Abordabe ranged mostly between [[Hark's Finger]] and the western banks of the [[Teardrops]]."
