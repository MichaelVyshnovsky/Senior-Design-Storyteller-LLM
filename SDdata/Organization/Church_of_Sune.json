Their primary mission was to guard Sunite temples and holy sites, and occasionally accompany clerics doing good works or questing for something important to the Lady of Love. Initiation into the order was done by standing vigil in a temple of Sune for an entire night. If the goddess showed her favor by granting a vision or some other boon, the candidate was accepted into the order.\nMain CategoryTemples to Sune\nThe temples of this faith always came in one of architectural philosophies, either being fantastical edifices of beauty or classically elegant structures whose beauty was enhanced by sculptured landscapes. Many featured formal gardens with landscape that had been precisely manicured, with trees and topiary that had been carefully pruned, picturesque beds of flowers, as well as bowers and trellises that were snaked by well-trained vines. Fountains and sculptures were often a focal point of these gardens, as they were enchanted to give off soft lighting.\nA common feature of Sunite temples was life-sized and smaller statues statuettes of beautiful women, usually partially unclad. Such statues were often posed depicting a dance and expressions of rapturous joy, though not always. Sometimes these statues were depictions of the goddess Sune herself, but more often they were of priestesses who had passed.\n* Dawndancer House, a shrine in Silverymoon\n* Flame Grove, a shrine west of Drawn Swords\n* Theater of Joy in Crimmor\n* Temple of Beauty in Waterdeep\n* Temple of Sune in Port Nyanzaru"
