        "Aims & Goals": "As an extension of the will of the dark wizard [[Manshoon]], the Zhentarim was initially formed as a mercenary company to support his rule over the [[Moonsea]] with the aim of spreading that control over all of Faerûn. After he recruited the faithful of Bane, unscrupulous merchants and lesser [[mage]]s to his cause, they collectively sought to dominate all aspects of the Realms, either by manipulation, outright control, or, if they couldn't exert control over something, extinction.\n\nAfter the mass purge by the Cyricists, known as the [[Banedeath]], and the subsequent partial destruction of [[Zhentil Keep]] following the [[Cyrinishad]] debacle, the control of the Zhentarim passed to the Bane-worshiping [[Fzoul Chembryl]]. He made secret deals with leaders in the Moonsea to erect temples to [[Iyachtu Xvim]], Bane's divine son, within the capitals of their city-states. His aim to extend the will of the Lord of Tyrants across Toril was a dynamic factor behind many of the changes within the organization.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century DR, the goals of the Zhentarim returned to their original ideals, despite their more benign public perception. By offering the ''best'' guards and mercenaries, with the final aim of an iron-fisted monopoly on protection services in the Realms, they sought to make the merchants of Faerûn, and thus the continental economy, completely reliant upon them as an organization. While many of the practices and services they offered were completely legal, they were not above spending a tremendous amount of gold to destroy their competitors and secure future profits to increase their wealth, influence, and power.{{Cite web/Factions: The Zhentarim}}",
        "Activities": "{{quote|Ooh, the sneaky rascals. If it wasn't for the rampant egotism, random murdering, and foul gods, I might quite like these Zhentarim.|[[Purfbin Doogrick]]}}\nIn order to achieve their financial goals, the Zhentarim agents often dealt in illicit goods and contraband, using their extensive mercantile contacts to move products throughout the Moonsea, neighboring lands and over Faerûn's more hazardous terrains. The types of commodities they dealt in were slaves, [[poison]], drugs and even [[smokepowder]] [[weapon]]s.\n\nAs a means of eliminating their competition, the Zhentarim used the [[Zhentilar]] army of Zhentil Keep or recruited bands of monstrous [[humanoid]]s to take down rival caravans, often completing the route under their own banner to earn good faith and new business with merchant groups. They were not above resorting to sabotage, blackmail, and arson to outright murder to undermine their mercantile or political opponents. They were even known to purposefully upset the balance of natural beasts, stir up aggressive monster populations within the wild, and even have their [[mage]]s summon foul monstrosities to threaten isolated towns and villages, in effect forcing the residents to rely on the protection of the Zhentilar.",
        "Organization": {
            "Inner Circle": "From the early years of the organization until [[1369 DR]], the Zhentarim was led by the triumvirate of [[Manshoon]], the ultimate authority and Lord of [[Zhentil Keep]]; [[Sememmon]], his student in the arcane who presided over Darkhold; and [[Fzoul Chembryl]], the High Priest of Bane. However, the Zhentarim was rife with mistrust, even amongst its upper echelons. While Manshoon had a bond of trust with his pupil Sememmon, his relationship with Fzoul was one of mutual disdain shrouded by public respect. While the three shared the same goal of increasing their collective wealth and power, it was at best an uneasy alliance that ultimately fell apart.",
            "The Moonsea": "",
            "Post Re-emergence of Bane": "After [[1370 DR]], the Black Network followed a strict linear hierarchy with Fzoul Chembryl serving as the Zhentarim's Grand Tyrant. Only the powerful lords would report directly to him, while lesser officers and agents would only report to their immediate superiors.\n\nThe only exception to the inherent power structure of the Zhentarim was Manshoon. While he allowed Fzoul to act as the supreme leader of the Zhentarim, he maintained command over any of its agents or resources to further its goals or his own endeavors."
        },
        "Relationships": {
            "Allies": "[[File:Zhentarim Agents.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''A rather intimidating group of Zhentarim agents.'']]\nThe Zhentarim had few allies, in comparison to their foes, but they were highly valued for their strategic value. The roster of these supporters were constantly changing along with interests and powers of the Zhentarim. They included:\n*[[Beholder]]s: Ever since Manshoon first allied himself with [[Xantriph]] of the [[Temple in the Sky]], the Zhentarim maintained a mutually beneficial relationship with various [[beholder]]s across Faerûn, though they maintained their own personal agendas. Xulla, a longtime ally of Fzoul Chembryl, took over this post following Xantriph's death, before becoming the Caravan Lord within the network. Under the assumed name of \"Xalval\", the [[elder orb]] [[Vaxall]] of the [[Twisted Rune]] was an ally of Teldorn Darkhope and controlled the city of [[Kzelter]]. and [[Zantiid]] oversaw the [[Stonelands]] in Cormyr.\n*[[Bloodswords]]: This [[Amn]]ian mercenary company drove away [[Cormyr]]ian patrols and non-Zhent caravans from the region of the [[High Road (Cormyr)|High Road]] west of [[Eagle Peak]] in the Storm Horns.\n*[[Harondalbar]]: The [[black dragon]] who maintained a lair near the [[Yellow Snake Pass]] kept non-Zhentarim forces from the area in return for the treasure, creatures, and adulation brought to him by his \"keeper\" [[Faren Starlight]].\n*[[Waterdeep]]: Unbeknownst to many, the Zhentarim had a tenuous peace with [[Khelben Arunsun|Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 1300s [[DR]], thanks to Fzoul Chembryl. Khelben \"Blackstaff\" exchanged certain information to Fzoul in exchange for an assurance that the Black Network would not expand their influence west of the [[Thunder Peaks]] for 30 years. This bargain led to a split between the [[Harpers]] and Khelben's independently operating [[Moonstars]].",
            "Foes": "Over the years, the Zhentarim drew the ire and hostility of a great number of peoples and organizations. They opposed any group they perceived as a threat to their interests to grow their trade and influence across Faerûn, including the [[Iron Throne]] of the [[Sword Coast]], the [[Rundeen]] of [[Calimshan]], and the fanatical [[Cult of the Dragon]]. They included:\n*[[Harpers]]: Due to their diametrically opposed world views, the Harpers were at odds with the Zhentarim ever since they became aware of the network's existence. Many of the highest-ranking members of the Harpers, such as [[Elminster Aumar]], and several of the [[Seven Sisters]] had sizable bounties placed upon their heads by the Black Network.\n*[[Knights of the North]]: This group of resistance fighters was formed in [[1355 DR]] after Zhentil Keep betrayed the allied forces of the Moonsea by violently seizing the Citadel of the Raven. Following the death of Commander [[Galauntar Hawkhelm]], his fellow Ravenar soldiers banded together and launched a guerrilla campaign against Zhent holdings and Zhentarim operations within the Moonsea.\n*[[Iron Throne]]\n*[[Cult of the Dragon]]\n*[[Rundeen]]\n*[[Red Wizards of Thay]]"
        },
        "History": {
            "Founding": "The Zhentarim was founded in the {{YearlinkName|1261}}, by the power-hungry wizard Manshoon, the lord of Zhentil Keep, as a tool for his ambitions of expanding his realm of control. He was soon joined by the Banite [[cleric]] Fzoul Chembryl in the {{YearlinkName|1263}}, who broke away from the orthodox church in [[Mulmaster]], bringing with him a small army of his fellow [[priest]]s into the lesser ranks of the Zhentarim. He then disposed of the high-ranking priests within Zhentil Keep and converted the city's lesser clergy to the worship of Bane. Paranoid even in the early years of their alliance, Manshoon offset the possible threat of Fzoul's influence by concocting a plan with the beholder Xantriph. They had the Banite priests confess their sins and swear fealty to Manshoon alone. Xantriph's lair, the floating Temple in the Sky, became an outpost for Zhentilar troops and Banite priests in former [[Teshendale]].\n\nManshoon planned on capturing the Citadel of the Raven during the first days of the Zhentarim, though they were not powerful enough as an organization to openly attack a city of the Moonsea. While it was openly discussed for years, many senior members of the Zhentarim advocated against assaulting the city, fearful of losing their investments that funded the Black Network.",
            "Growth": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Manshoon seized the fortress of [[Darkhold]] from the [[Lich]]-Queen [[Varalla]] in order to extend his control into the [[Western Heartlands]]. Four years later, they invaded and seized [[Teshendale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1336}}.\n\nThey then conquered and installed their own rulers in [[Daggerdale]] in [[1336 DR]]. Manshoon consolidated his rule over all Zhent lands and declared himself the High Lord of Zhentil Keep the [[1337 DR|following year]]. These actions caused the nations of the Moonsea to grow wary of the Zhentarim and Zhentil Keep.\n\nAlso that year, Manshoon granted the previously occupied [[Yûlash]] its independence, and maneuvered this act of \"good will\" to call a meeting of the rulers of the Moonsea in the neutral town of [[Elmwood]]. He called for a garrison to be established at the Citadel of the Raven to protect the greater Moonsea from a horde of orcs that was stirring further north. He \"graciously\" offered to move the recently evicted Zhentilar soldiers from Yûlash to the city, though this was merely part of a long-term scheme to take over the city.\n\nThe Zhentarim saw significant losses in the next few years when [[Jyordhan]], puppet ruler of Shadowdale, was assassinated by [[Khelben Arunsun]]; Xantriph was killed by the [[Knights of Myth Drannor]]; and [[Malyk]], the puppet ruler of Daggerdale, was killed by [[Randal Morn]], leading to all-out civil war.\n\nDespite their losses, the time was right in the {{YearlinkName|1355}} for the Zhentarim to strike against their former allies in the Citadel of the Raven. They had their agents planted within the city kill as many as they could, using [[poison]] and magic. The orcs and [[Zhentilar]] poured into the city and claimed it for the Zhentarim. One of the few survivors within the Citadel was the mortally wounded [[Galauntar Hawkhelm]], whose eventual death would lead to the formation of the [[Knights of the North]].",
            "Banedeath": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Bane arrived in the [[Black Altar]]. He ordered his devoted priest Fzoul Chembryl and Manshoon's apprentice Sememmon to work together, much to their mutual displeasure, in an assault on the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba]] in [[Shadowdale]] so that he could enter [[Morningdawn Hall]]. After the destruction of the Dark God's [[avatar]], the newly ascended deity Cyric, who took on his divine portfolio, became the focus of worship for a great number of the members of the Zhentarim. Fzoul Chembryl and a few others maintained their faith, while some others converted to the veneration of [[Iyachtu Xvim]], Bane's divine son.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, the Zhentarim began their campaign to take control of a trade route that ran through the desert of [[Anauroch]]. They were initially rebuffed by the unified tribes of the Bedine, aided by the Harper agent [[Lander]] and an exiled [[sorceress]] known as [[Ruha]].\n\nThe conflict between the opposing faiths embedded within the Zhentarim culminated in an event known as the [[Banedeath]], which began on [[Marpenoth 30]], the {{YearlinkName|1361}}. [[Xeno Mirrormane]], Manshoon realized that Cyric was no replacement for the calculating cunning and patience of Bane. \n\nOver a period of six months in the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, Manshoon quietly and discreetly shifted resources and personnel from Zhentil Keep to the Citadel of the Raven, being distrustful of the impulsive Cyric and his inept clergy members. Fzoul Chembryl saw these actions and remained neutral, still bitter from his loss of influence as the High Priest of Bane.",
            "Cyrinishad": "Cyric was eventually undermined by a divine conspiracy involving High Lord Fzoul. The larger northern half of Zhentil Keep was left in ruins as a result. Some 1,500 Zhentilar and Zhentarim, many of whom were high-ranking officers, and all the [[orc]] troops fled the city.",
            "Manshoon Wars": "In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Fzoul and Lord [[Orgauth]] attacked and killed Manshoon. However, Manshoon lived on through clone bodies, many of whom fought and killed each other. Of these, one returned to the Zhentarim, conceded all leadership to Fzoul, and worked as an agent.",
            "Resurrection of Bane": "[[File:New_Zhentarim_Symbol.jpg|thumb|right|''Symbol of the Zhentarim under Fzoul ''circa'' 1372 DR.'']]\nBane was resurrected on [[Midwinter]] night in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.\n\nIn the early morning hours of [[Nightal 16]], the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a Zhentarim army led by Scyllua Darkhope overran [[Shadowdale]] from the north. They were aided by the church of [[Shar]] and [[House Dhuurniv]], who attacked the [[Twisted Tower]] from below. The [[Army of Myth Drannor]] was unable to respond as Zhentarim brigades to the east launched simultaneous attacks on several key elven fortifications.{{Cite dragon/Cormanthor: War Amidst the Trees|71}}<ref>\n\nA Zhent named [[Karne]] attempted to take over the [[Onyx Tower]], but the plan ultimately failed.\n\nIn the [[1383 DR|Year of the Vindicated Warrior, 1383 DR]], the [[Shadovar]] moved against Zhentil Keep during the [[Shadowbane War]], razing it along with the Citadel of the Raven, killing both Fzoul and the final clone of Manshoon, leaving only Darkhold left.<ref>",
            "15{{th}} century": "[[File:Zhentarim FRCG 4e.jpg|thumb|right|''Symbol ''circa'' 1479 DR.'']]\nThe Zhentarim was again taken over by the forces of Cyric, who engaged in battle with the forces of Bane. In the {{YearlinkName|1420}}, an evil mage named [[Rezlus]] took over the Banites and attempted to conquer Daggerdale. He failed and the Banites fell with only the forces of Cyric remaining. \n\nUnder the leadership of the Pereghost, the Zhentarim transitioned from a conquering force into a mercenary army that served others. As of [[1489 DR]], the Zhentarim were said to have greater numbers than ever before and had a reputation for service unlike any time in their history.",
            "Post–Second Sundering": "[[File:5e Zhentarim badge.png|thumb|left|''Symbol ''circa'' 1490 DR.'']]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, the Zhentarim sent an agent, the [[gnome]] assassin [[Jamna Gleamsilver]], to investigate the recent activities of the Cult of the Dragon, as they had been growing in power rather rapidly. They allied with several other factions, including those which would otherwise be enemies, to rise up against the Cult and [[Red Wizards of Thay|Red Wizards']] attempts to free the [[dragon]] god [[Tiamat]]."
