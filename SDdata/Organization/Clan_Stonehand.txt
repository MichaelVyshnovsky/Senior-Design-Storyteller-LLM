'''Clan Stonehand''' was a family of [[dwarves]] that lived in the town of [[Daggerford]] circa the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were skilled masons that had lived there for generations prior to the [[Era of Upheaval]].{{Cite web/Siege of Dragonspear: Field Report|24}}

==History==
Many of the clan's members fought during the [[Second Dragonspear War]] of [[1363 DR]].

Sometime before [[1372 DR]], the clan was led by [[Kurgin Stonehand]]. During his reign, the clan owned a mine not far from the swamp home of an old [[black dragon]] [[Zarkursk]]. Eventually, the Stonehand warriors defeated the wyrm and inherited its horde of [[gem]]stones. This suddenly made all the young members of the clan highly desirable bachelors, especially among the women of the [[Clan Licehair]]. To battle with these unwanted advances, Kurgin Stonehand commissioned creations of so-called ''[[dwarven belt of charming]]''. These magic items were [[enchanted]] to plummet the wearer's appeal and charisma to levels well below the dwarven standards.

==Members==
* [[Haither Stonehand]], general of the [[army of Daggerford]] circa the [[War of the Shining Crusade]]
* [[Kurgin Stonehand]], the leader of Clan Stonehand sometime before 1372 DR.
