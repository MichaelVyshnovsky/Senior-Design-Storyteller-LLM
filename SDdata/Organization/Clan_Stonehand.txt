Clan Stonehand was a family of dwarves that lived in the town of Daggerford circa the midâ€“14 century DR. They were skilled masons that had lived there for generations prior to the Era of Upheaval.
Many of the clans members fought during the Second Dragonspear War of 1363 DR.
Sometime before 1372 DR, the clan was led by Kurgin Stonehand. During his reign, the clan owned a mine not far from the swamp home of an old black dragon Zarkursk. Eventually, the Stonehand warriors defeated the wyrm and inherited its horde of gemstones. This suddenly made all the young members of the clan highly desirable bachelors, especially among the women of the Clan Licehair. To battle with these unwanted advances, Kurgin Stonehand commissioned creations of so-called dwarven belt of charming. These magic items were enchanted to plummet the wearers appeal and charisma to levels well below the dwarven standards.
