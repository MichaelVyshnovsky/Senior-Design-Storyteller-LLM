        "mainbody": "e Guard's duties were to both defend the city of Tantras and to police it.",
        "Base": "The Guard were based in the [[Sea Tower (Tantras)|Sea Tower]] in the city of Tantras, standing on the coast at the southern side of the bay opening. The Sea Tower was the city's main fortress, and held armories and training areas for soldiers.\n\nThe Guard also maintained [[ballista]] batteries on the coast and on either side of the entrance of the harbor mouth, together with a chain-boom barrier strung across it, and [[catapult]]s mounted on coast towers. The Guard also manned the gates and towers encircling the city.\n\nWhen preparing for war, the Guard would commandeer inns and privately owned buildings around the city for use as army barracks and recruiting posts.",
        "Organization": "In 1358 DR, shortly after the Time of Troubles, the Guard was commanded by [[Lassalar Ormitar]], who was also head of the [[Ormitar]] noble house and a member of the High Council that governed Tantras. Although the Guard was directly responsible to the Council, its loyalties lay with Lassalar, who was more serious about restricting merchant freedoms in favor of law and order.\n\nThe Guard consisted of around 900 male and female [[fighter]]s, mostly well-trained warriors.. They typically formed units of fourteen, with one sergeant leading. Officers commanded multiple units and sections of the city, such as the harbor. There were standing garrisons of thirty [[crossbow]]men to protect the harbor and man the ballista batteries there. [[Wizard]]s and [[cleric]]s could also be called upon for help.\n\nTantras also had a reserve militia of about 6,000 that could be called up when needed. However, these were mostly not professionals but folk with other jobs and thus they were considered poor-quality troops.\n\nMembers of the Guard had the following ranks:\n{|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; margin-left:25px\"\n!| Rank   \n!| Title\n|-\n| [[Generic Guard man-at-arms (Tantras)|Man-at-arms]]         || \n|-\n| [[Generic Guard sergeant (Tantras)|Sergeant]]          || \"Longsword\"\n|-\n| [[Generic Guard officer (Tantras)|Officer]]           || \n|}",
        "Activities": "The Guard's duties were to both defend the city of Tantras and to police it.",
        "Tactics": "The Guard regularly patrolled the city with fourteen-strong mobile units. If more than one unit was required, an officer joined them to take command. Crossbowmen and wizards were called in emergencies.\n\nUpon encountering trouble, the Guard's standard practice was to first try to resolve the matter peacefully, by calling for all parties to put away their weapons and answer their questions, usually with a \"Whot's all this then?\" However, when faced with a crisis situation in which Tantran citizens were in danger, they would use force, attacking first and sorting it out after, and using a ''[[speak with dead]]'' spell if need be. The many priests in Tantras made this a practical response.",
        "Possessions": "Soldiers of the Guard were outfitted in blue oiled [[plate mail]] armor emblazoned with the coat of arms of Tantras: three silver stars over a silver breaking wave on a field of royal blue, called the \"blue and silver\". [[Generic Guard man-at-arms (Tantras)|Regular soldiers]] carried [[spear]]s, [[short sword]]s, and [[dagger]]s, while [[Generic Guard sergeant (Tantras)|sergeants]] carried [[longsword]]s and [[mace]]s, and [[Generic Guard officer (Tantras)|officers]] wielded maces, [[morningstar]]s, or short swords. Ranged units possessed [[crossbow]]s or operated ballistae.",
        "History": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] of the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], Tantras mustered its troops in preparation for an attack from [[Zhentil Keep]]. To that end, the Guard commandeered several inns—such as the [[Roaring Lion Inn|Roaring Lion]] and [[Gulder's Good Grubb Inn|Gulder's Good Grubb]]—and other privately owned buildings for use as barracks and recruiting posts. [[Halemar's Fine Blades]], an armorer and weaponsmithy, was also tasked with crafting for the army.\n\nKing [[Azoun IV]] of [[Cormyr]] called for a crusade against the [[Tuigan Horde]] in the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]]. Tantras sent envoys to Azoun's council on [[Tarsakh 10]], represented by a gruff and unshaven Tantran commander. Tantras contributed 1,600 soldiers, mostly well-trained and all volunteers, as well as a number of wizards, to the crusade."
