        "mainbody": "The '''Iron Ring''' was a consortium of the most powerful [[slaver]]s in [[Skullport]].",
        "Activities": "The Iron Ring's primary interest was slaving and protecting the slave trade in Skullport and [[Undermountain]]. To that effect, they prevented poaching by guarding unsold slaves, limiting the influence of foreign slavers, and attempting to keep the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] out of their business. Independent and rival slavers who refused to join the consortium were ruthlessly eliminated.",
        "History": "The Iron Ring was founded in [[1363 DR]] in Skullport by two powerful slavers (who happened to hate each other), the [[yuan-ti abomination]] [[Zstulkk Ssarmn]] and the priest of [[Loviatar]] [[Quinan Varnaed]]. The alliance was very profitable and grew quickly until in less than ten years' time it came to control most of the slave trafficking in Skullport and Undermountain.",
        "Headquarters": "The Iron Ring was based in Skullport and operated throughout the city and in Undermountain.",
        "Leadership": "The five leaders of the Iron Ring were known as as the \"Lords of Iron.\" Each of them was the leader of their own slave organization. Their names were [[Ahmaergo]] the \"Horned Dwarf\" ([[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]]), Zstulkk Ssarmn, [[Transtra]], [[Malakuth Tabuirr]] ([[Dark Dagger]]), and Quinan Varnaed ([[Tower of the Seven Woes]]). Varnaed was considered the guild's informal leader.",
        "Members": "The members of the guild were varied. They always carried [[manacles]] or other restraints and were known for the keys and keyrings found dangling on their belts.",
        "Relationships": "While dangerous, the Iron Ring was limited by their rivalry with the [[Black Network]], [[Iron Throne]], the [[Shadow Thieves]], and the [[Xanatos Slave Network]].  Recently, the [[yuan-ti]] have taken an increasing interest in the organization and thus have been exponentially increasing their power, through diluting their previously profit-motivated goals with a new focus upon increasing the influence of the snake people.\n\nThe evil rogue [[elf]] [[Zabbas Thuul]] worked for many years with the Iron Ring.",
