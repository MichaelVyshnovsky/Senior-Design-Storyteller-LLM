        "History": "{{See also|Absolute Crisis}}\nIn [[1492 DR]], many important residents of [[Baldur's Gate]] appeared to act strangely. This included the high priest of [[Kelemvor]], Father [[Alby]], as well as the [[Head Librarian]] of [[Knowledge-Hold]], [[Hayley Kroe]]. The former believed he had found insights into existence, whilst the latter was hoarding [[magic]] materials. It turned out both had joined the Cult of the Absolute, and at least Alby had become a [[True Soul]]. After a ritual, Father Alby slew Hayley Kroe with a [[dagger]] resembling a [[mind flayer]]. The [[Heroes of Baldur's Gate]] had been spying on the cultists, and were soon revealed. They were told that they would have to join the cult or be destroyed. \n\n{{Quote\n|You will ''join'' [[the Absolute]] and be ''cleansed'', or ''resist'' and be ''destroyed''!\n|Alby, a cultist of the Absolute \n}}\n\n[[File:Cultist of the Absolute CLB.jpg|thumb|270px|A cultist of the Absolute]]\nThe Cult of the Absolute appeared to accrue followers in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Several groups of [[goblinoid]]s pledged allegiance to the Absolute, to the point where they even abandoned worship of the chief of their godly pantheon, [[Maglubiyet]]. Drow, [[gnoll]]s, and other beings also joined the cult. Some time later, it was claimed that the cult had taken Grand Duke [[Ulder Ravengard]] to Moonrise Towers."
