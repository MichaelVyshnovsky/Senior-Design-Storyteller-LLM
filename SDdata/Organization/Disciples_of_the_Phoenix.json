        "mainbody": "The '''Disciples of the Phoenix''' were an order of [[monk]]s that worshiped the 'good' aspects of the [[deity]] [[Kossuth]]. They strongly believed in the purging redemption of fire and practiced the more rigid, ultra-orthodox practices of the [[Church of Kossuth]].\n\nThey were extremely studious and devoted themselves to teachings of the Firelord.",
        "Practices": "As dedicated they were in their practices, Phoenix monks would only eat cooked food and drink water that had been purified by boiling. They were known for branding themselves as punishment, for what they viewed as sins. If they committed a cardinal sin, they would even commit suicide by self-immolation."
