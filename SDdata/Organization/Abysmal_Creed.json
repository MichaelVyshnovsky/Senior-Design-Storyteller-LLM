        "mainbody": "The Abysmal Creed was one of the major illithid Creeds in the Realms. They focused on instilling fear into thrall populations. They were highly efficient at torturing thrall races. One such method was the use of the Nerve swimmer.\nThe Abysmals had a base called the Vaults of Terror in Oryndoll. In the city, they were not only known for being able to efficiently cow the thrall population, but they were also known for making decorative masks that captured moments of pure terror upon them, which they sold to whoever would buy them. They worked closely with the Venerator Creed."
