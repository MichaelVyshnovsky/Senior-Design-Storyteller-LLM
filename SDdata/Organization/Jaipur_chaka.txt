The '''Jaipur chaka''' was a successful [[chaka]] within the [[Shining Lands]] in [[1367 DR]].

==Organization==
The Jaipurs owned thousands of acres of farmland in [[Var the Golden]]. However, the majority of their financial success came from their sea trade. They were second to none within the Shining Lands in delivering goods across the [[Shining South]] and beyond, including two successful ventures to distant [[Maztica]].

As of 1367 DR, they hoped to supplant the [[Baroda chaka]] with one of their members for the fifth seat on the [[Council of Merchants]].

==Base of Operations==
The Jaipur chaka was based out of [[Myrmyr]] in eastern Var the Golden.
