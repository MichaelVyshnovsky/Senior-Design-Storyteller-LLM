        "mainbody": "The '''cult of Voldini''' was a group of [[elven]] fanatics dedicated to returning the lost kingdom of [[Yuireshanyaar]] to prominence in the realm of [[Aglarond]],{{Cite organized play/LFR/Through Twilight Boughs|13}} and restoring to existence the ancient gods of the [[Yuir pantheon]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Through Twilight Boughs|4}} It was believed to have been led by [[Voldini]], an [[noble eladrin|eladrin]] witch who dwelled within a solitary tower on an isle within the realm.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Twilight Ambitions|5}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Twilight Ambitions|18}}",
        "Organization": "The cult was not particularly large, but held some influence over disillusioned [[fey]] and [[elves]] that dwelled within the [[Yuirwood]] and beyond.{{Cite organized play/LFR/First Strike|4}}",
        "Activities": "Much of the cult's plots involved the ''[[Tome of Twilight Boughs]]'', an enigmatic and millennium-old [[Yuir]] text.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Through Twilight Boughs|30}} The book contained magically encrypted text, including the specifications for the ancient ''[[Ritual of the Doomed]]''. It appeared that, when the ritual was performed within areas afflicted by the [[Spellplague]], disastrous effects would ensue.\n\nIn fact, Vol Saffras was dedicated to fully understanding―and eventually controlling―the patches of [[plaguelands]] that appeared throughout Aglarond. She spent decades infiltrating and forming bonds with the outcast fey in the realm and learned secrets of the ancient Yuir. Vol Saffras conducted horrific experiments on the \"loyal cultists\" who had been exposed by effects of the Spellplague.",
        "History": "Some time ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1479}},{{4e-time}} a group of cultists led by [[Berrain Truescourge]] managed to use a copy of the ''Tome of Twilight Boughs'' to briefly return the [[Temple of the Yuir Gods]] back to the Yuirwood in [[Faerûn]]. While the ritual the cultists used let loose corrupting energies on nearby fey creatures in the forest, a group of adventurers managed to successfully restore the temple to its place in the Feywild. Unfortunately for the cultists, that copy of the tome was lost to them.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Lost Temple of the Fey Gods|4,21}}\n\nThe cultists then sought a second copy of the ''Tome of Twilight Boughs'' from the [[half-elven]] scholar [[Aldaron]] the Loremaster, in the city of [[Veltalar]]. It was believed that Aldaron managed to translate one of the more esoteric rituals within the tome's text. The cultists assaulted Aldaron at his estate, and were once again successful in retrieving what they sought.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Through Twilight Boughs|4}} They traveled through [[Sildëyuir]] in the Feywild{{Cite organized play/LFR/Through Twilight Boughs|19}} and initiated the ''Ritual of the Doomed'' in a patch of plaguelands within the Yuirwood. Unbeknownst to the cultists, their ritual had gone awry and, while in the throes of their ceremonies, they transformed themselves into monstrous abominations.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Through Twilight Boughs|21-23}}\n\nThe cultists' numerous attempts to harness the powers of the ''Tome of Twilight Boughs'' attracted the attention of Aglarond's [[Simbarch Council]] and Commander [[Dezar]] of the [[Simbarch Guard]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Twilight Ambitions|23-24}}\n\nAfter \"Voldini\" was defeated, her cult was disbanded. The true Vol Zaffras survived however, and was allowed to continue her arcane research throughout Aglarond.{{Cite organized play/LFR/First Strike|5}}"
