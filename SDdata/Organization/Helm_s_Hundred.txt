The Helms Hundred was an army that operated out of Helms Hold on the Sword Coast North during the midâ€“14 century DR.
The group was some 100 soldiers strong.
During the spring months each year, the Helms Hundred would venture out from Helms Hold to Sundabar, in order to fight against the demons that infested Hellgate Keep.
