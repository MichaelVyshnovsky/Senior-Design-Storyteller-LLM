        "mainbody": "'''House Sseradess''' was a tribe of [[yuan-ti]] known for their prowess underwater.",
        "Base of Operations": "House Sseradess once dominated the [[Thindol Basin]] until their [[lizardfolk]] slaves were defeated by soldiers of the [[Shoon Imperium]] in the {{YearlinkName|293}}, forcing them to retreat to undersea lairs. They were able to gain back some control by infiltrating the courts in Thindol. However, this ended in the {{YearlinkName|605}}, when all of their agents were discovered.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, House Sseradess controlled all of the waterways of Thindol as well as [[Labrand's Folly]]â€“a large subterranean passage\n\nHouse Sseradess maintained the underwater coral fortress of [[Khass'insara]] near Thindol's capital city of [[Thindar]].",
        "Relationships": "Given the relative isolation of House Sseradess' holdings from the other great yuan-ti tribes, this tribe had no allies or enemies among their kin.",
        "Activities": "House Sseradess strove to dominate the [[human]]s of Thindol since their defeats in the past. However, this was made more difficult by the vigilance of the large number of inhabitants of Thindol who feared snakes. The Sseradess were able to conquer the various [[kuo-toa]] tribes of [[Gathgoolgapool]]. They used the kua-toa to harvest food and other materials from the sea that could be sold for coin in Thindol.\n\nAll members of House Sseradess could breathe underwater and were completely at home in that environment.\n\nThe Sseradess poisoned [[Gurdeth]]'s wells with a diluted version of the poison used to create [[tainted one]]s, resulting in the creation of tainted one and [[broodguard]] servants for the house. Some of these creations were executed within the city when they ran amok.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|-289}}, House Sseradess, along with allies from [[House Sauringar]], enslaved the [[Thinguth]] tribe of the [[Guthland]]. The Thinguth remained as slaves of the yuan-ti until their liberation by the Shoon Imperium in [[293 DR]]."
