They were able to gain back some control by infiltrating the courts in Thindol. However, this ended in the , when all of their agents were discovered.\nAs of the , House Sseradess controlled all of the waterways of Thindol as well as Labrands Follyâ€“a large subterranean passage\nHouse Sseradess maintained the underwater coral fortress of Khassinsara near Thindols capital city of Thindar.\nGiven the relative isolation of House Sseradess holdings from the other great yuan-ti tribes, this tribe had no allies or enemies among their kin.\nHouse Sseradess strove to dominate the humans of Thindol since their defeats in the past. However, this was made more difficult by the vigilance of the large number of inhabitants of Thindol who feared snakes. The Sseradess were able to conquer the various kuo-toa tribes of Gathgoolgapool. They used the kua-toa to harvest food and other materials from the sea that could be sold for coin in Thindol.\nAll members of House Sseradess could breathe underwater and were completely at home in that environment.\nThe Sseradess poisoned Gurdeths wells with a diluted version of the poison used to create tainted ones, resulting in the creation of tainted one and broodguard servants for the house. Some of these creations were executed within the city when they ran amok.\nIn the , House Sseradess, along with allies from House Sauringar, enslaved the Thinguth tribe of the Guthland. The Thinguth remained as slaves of the yuan-ti until their liberation by the Shoon Imperium in 293 DR."
