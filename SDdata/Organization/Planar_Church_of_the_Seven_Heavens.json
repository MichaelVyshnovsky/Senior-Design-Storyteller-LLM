        "mainbody": "he Planar Church of the Seven Heavens was a religious organization present across various crystal spheres that was dedicated to the veneration of the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, the pinnacle of lawful goodness in the Outer Planes, as well as all of the deities that resided within it.\nThis church solely venerated deities that resided within the Seven Heavens, This included members of the Dwarven pantheon, the Halfling pantheon, the Vedic pantheon, and many other pantheons.\nWithin Realmspace, the Church had a temple and sect within the city of Bral, the sole city on the Rock of Bral.\nLike any planar church, the priests of this faith counted as polygots. And due to venerating such a wide range of deities, the priests of this Church found themselves having access to their divine magic within the majority of crystal spheres.\nThe members of this faith were generally accepting of those whose patron deity resided within the Seven Heavens and were willing to grant them aid. However, priests of individual deities often found it hard to accept the Churchs rather broad brand of veneration and were also liable to commune with their deity to discern whether or not the Church was an acceptable form of veneration for them.\nIn terms of other planar churches, this Church had a good natured rivalry with the Planar Church of Olympus. With members of both clergies sometimes cooperating against evil causes."
