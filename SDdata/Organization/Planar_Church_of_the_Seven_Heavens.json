        "mainbody": "The '''Planar Church of the Seven Heavens''' was a religious organization present across various [[crystal sphere]]s that was dedicated to the veneration of the [[Mount Celestia|Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia]], the pinnacle of [[lawful good]]ness in the [[Outer Planes]], as well as all of the [[deities]] that resided within it.",
        "Dogma": "This church solely venerated deities that resided within the Seven Heavens, This included members of the [[Dwarven pantheon]], the [[Halfling pantheon]], the [[Vedic pantheon]], and many other [[pantheon]]s.",
        "Bases": {
            "Notable Locations": "Within [[Realmspace]], the Church had [[Planar Church of the Seven Heavens (Bral)|a temple]] and sect within the city of [[Bral]], the sole city on the [[Rock of Bral]]."
        },
        "Equipment, Spells, and Relics": "Like any planar church, the [[priest]]s of this faith counted as [[polygot]]s. And due to venerating such a wide range of deities, the priests of this Church found themselves having access to their [[divine magic]] within the majority of crystal spheres.",
        "Relationships": "The members of this faith were generally accepting of those whose patron deity resided within the Seven Heavens and were willing to grant them aid. However, priests of individual deities often found it hard to accept the Church's rather broad brand of veneration and were also liable to ''[[commune]]'' with their deity to discern whether or not the Church was an acceptable form of veneration for them.\n\nIn terms of other planar churches, this Church had a good natured rivalry with the [[Planar Church of Olympus]]. With members of both clergies sometimes cooperating against [[evil]] causes."
