The '''Urshani''' were an unusually feral tribe of [[hobgoblin]]s living in the [[High Moor]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Their feral nature and bestial ways were a result of their close connection to the [[worg]]s of [[Mishka's Warren]].

==Description==
The Urshani were known by their especially savage appearance, namely by wearing [[wolf]] furs and carrying shields painted with [[worg]] heads, as well as having other wolf parts and symbols on them.

==History==
By [[1479 DR]], the Urshani had domesticated a pack of worgs. The clan was located in an old ruin in the northwestern portion of the [[High Moor]] called Mishka's Warren. Seeking prey, The Urshani and their worgs ventured out of the moor and over the [[Delimbiyr River]]. [[Secomber]] was a frequent target of raids.

In the years after the [[War of the Silver Marches]], the Ushani menaced the town of [[Secomber]]. Several times a year, the hobgoblins demanded tribute, and people surrendered food, homemade ale, and ore to stay free. However, the worgs and hobgoblins still attacked on occasion.
