Its members were from the [[Sword Coast]], [[the North]] and [[Western Heartlands]], including [[Waterdeep]], [[Silverymoon]], [[Baldur's Gate]], and [[Neverwinter]], as well as other free cities and towns in the region, which made up the bulk of the organization. rampaging hordes of [[orc]]s, and [[Northlander]] raiders.\n\n{{Quote|For a century and a half, and more, the Lords' Alliance has stood as the most important and influential group in the North.

        "Organization": "Depending on who was asked, the Lords' Alliance was considered either a strong coalition, others insisted they were among the most secure governing bodies in the west. The true strength of the alliance, it was said, manifested when its members banded together on collaborative endeavors. \n\nWhile some of these cities and city-states held more influence than others, they aligned their goals for the greater good and prosperity of the whole alliance. Collectively they believed in the preservation of civilization for the better of their people.\n\nThe alliance's emblem was a golden crown set over a field of red.",
        "Alliance Members and Leaders": "These were the member states and their leaders as of [[1489 DR]].\n\n* Amphail: Lord [[Dauner Ilzimmer]]\n* Baldur's Gate: Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate and Marshal of the [[Flaming Fists]] [[Ulder Ravengard]]\n* Daggerford: Duchess [[Morwen Daggerford]]\n* Longsaddle: [[Dowell Harpell]]\n* Mithral Hall: Queen [[Dagnabbet|Dagnabbet Waybeard]]\n* Mirabar: [[Marchion]] [[Selin Ramur]]\n* Neverwinter: Lord Protector [[Dagult Neverember]]\n* Silverymoon: High Mage [[Taern Hornblade]]\n* Waterdeep: Open Lord [[Laeral Silverhand]] (she was also the leader of the Alliance)\n* Yartar: Waterbaron [[Nestra Ruthiol]]",
        "Activities": "Member-states of the Lords' Alliance served to better the collective regions of the North and the Western Heartlands as a whole. They achieved this through well-wrought mercantile treaties and official pledges to ensure their collective safety, especially along prominent trade routes. The collective group bargained with foreign trading partners and even regulated preferred relations and treatment of certain groups long-feared by many people of the Coast and the North, such as [[goblinoid]]s and [[orc]] tribes. \n\nThe alliance often took charge whenever it was necessary to take military action in campaigns that arose across the North or the Heartlands.\n\nThe Lords Alliance also maintained the prison of [[Revel's End]], an isolated panopticon in the [[Frozenfar]] that housed some of most heinous criminals from across the North and Sword Coast.",
        "Tactics": "The alliance usually hired [[adventurer]]s to work for them in the past for tasks ranging from gathering simple information, or even for use in raids against Zhentarim strongholds and outposts. Local adventurers could quickly gain status, as well as powerful friends by helping the alliance, but can just as easily make enemies of the sinister Zhentarim as a result.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Lords' Alliance signet ring.png|thumb|right|200px|''A 15{{th}} century DR Lords' Alliance signet [[ring]].'']]\nAmong the orders with which the Lords' Alliance maintained a pledge of mutual assistance in times of need were a group of spellcasters known as the [[Guardians of the Weave]].\n\nThe [[Order of Tye]] was the prestigious knightly organization that served as guards for ranking Lords' Alliance members during their travels outside the walls of the allied cities and accompanied them on dangerous mission. [[Lord Peneshay]] led the organization ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].\n\nWhile they did not view the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] as enemies, the Lords' Alliance treated the Thayan spellcasting society with much mistrust.",
        "History": {
            "14{{th}} Century": "The Lords' Alliance was formed in the {{YearlinkName|1325}}, when a collective of towns and cities across the [[Sword Coast North]] banded together to oppose overreach from the powerful merchant houses of Amn. Interest in joining the alliance was strongest in the North at first, but gradually spread south over the course of the following years.\n\nJust over three decades later, in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the Lords' Alliance of Waterdeep expels [[Luskan]] troops from [[Ruathym]] by using both military and diplomatic pressures. They were forced into outright military conflict just [[1361 DR|three years later]], when Luskan finally conquered the island off the coast.\n\nThe Lords' Alliance committed their forces to combat the forces of evil during the [[Second Dragonspear War]] in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}. Following the war, the Lords' Alliance redoubled their efforts to make safe the [[Trade Way]], and ensure commerce along the coast went unimpeded.\n\nWhen a number of Waterdhavian vessels were sunk during their voyages from the Sword Coast to [[Maztica]], in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the Lords' Alliance worked diligently to collect evidence against the suspected culprits: the nation of Amn.\n\nAfter the [[Sharn Wall]] beneath [[Evereska]] was breached in [[Nightal]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the Last Home of the elves was rapidly overrun. An army of the Lords' Alliance led by [[Laeral Silverhand]] marched to the city in relief. Unfortunately, they did not arrive at Evereska for some months.",

Many places of note within ceased communication with each other and the surface world. The little information that did come out, revolved around cults of [[demon]]-worshippers.\n\nWhen the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]] of the [[giant]]-kind of Faerûn collapsed, rumors circulated that the Lords' Alliance was responsible for the disappearance of [[Hekaton]], king of the [[storm giant]]s.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the [[Luruar|Silver Marches]], in the {{YearlinkName|1488}}, the Lords' Alliance focused inwards and began restricting new members from beyond the borders of the North.\n\nSome time during or around the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, Lords' Alliance agents operating in the [[Moonsea]] region began looking into unusual activities in and around [[Mulmaster]].{{Cite adventurers league/Embers of Elmwood|15}} Their involvement in city business led production talks with members of the city's [[Blades (Mulmaster)|Blades]],{{Cite adventurers league/Breath of the Yellow Rose|7}} and the [[Hawks]],{{Cite adventurers league/Oubliette of Fort Iron|6}} which they hoped to leverage into the admittance of Mulmaster into the alliance, or at least adherence to its tenets.{{Cite adventurers league/The Sword of Selfaril|6}} When the [[Cult of the Eternal Flame]] set off explosions in the city, agents of the Lords' Alliance sprang into action to help restore order.{{Cite adventurers league/Mulmaster Undone|8-11}}"
