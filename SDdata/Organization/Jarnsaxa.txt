The '''Jarnsaxa''' were a reclusive [[amazon]] tribe, also known as '''"The Iron-Crushers of the World"''', that resided to the north of [[Yal Tengri]], the Great Ice Sea of the [[Hordelands]].

==History==
By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Jarnsaxa tribe was considered to be an almost legendary group of [[barbarian]] woman warriors. They were characterized as individuals who respected strength and womanhood. The Jarnsaxa thought males and non-warrior women to be beneath them and often refused to travel alongside anyone but the strongest female fighters.

One member of the tribe, [[Neysea Snowwolf]], left her cold northern home in pursuit of [[coin]] to finance her dream of a stable-full of powerful war-bred [[horse]]s.
