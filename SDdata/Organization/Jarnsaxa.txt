The Jarnsaxa were a reclusive amazon tribe, also known as "The Iron-Crushers of the World", that resided to the north of Yal Tengri, the Great Ice Sea of the Hordelands.
By the 14 century DR, the Jarnsaxa tribe was considered to be an almost legendary group of barbarian woman warriors. They were characterized as individuals who respected strength and womanhood. The Jarnsaxa thought males and non-warrior women to be beneath them and often refused to travel alongside anyone but the strongest female fighters.
One member of the tribe, Neysea Snowwolf, left her cold northern home in pursuit of coin to finance her dream of a stable-full of powerful war-bred horses.
