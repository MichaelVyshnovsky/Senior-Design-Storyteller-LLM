The '''Builders' Guild''' was one of the preeminent crafts guilds of the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], dedicated to the industry of construction, which experienced a significant boom in business following the wake of the [[Three Women War]].

==Activities==
The financial success brought about by work contracts following the Three Women War made many members of the Builders' Guild became unto lords-to-be or minor wealthy merchants. Coming from menial laborer backgrounds, most members dressed in dirty work wear and preferred to work with their own hands. But for other members this success went to their heads and, rather than retaining the "simple living" lifestyle professed by the guild's officers, they began engaging in lavish fashion and activities, such as [[spear]]hunting [[shark]]s from [[griffon]]back.

Some members invested their profits by sponsoring dozens of small businesses in the city, whilst others resorted to constructing shop buildings for other people to operate in. These builders would take a cut of 10 to 20 percent of their tenants' profits, though they would not see fit to invest so much as a [[copper piece]] in them. However, their lives made it impossible for them to properly inspect the honesty of their tenants or check on the safety of their properties, resulting in rampant fraud.

To combat any deception among their tenants, wealthy members began hiring [[adventuring companies]], which acted as a sort of status symbol and private army that could rival that of Ravens Bluff's lords. These adventurers were primarily employed to guard their families, buildings, and investments. But in time the builders took things a step further, having these adventurers spy on their rivals, scout out potential sites for new buildings, or even leveraging them as threats against their rivals.

However, the Ravenian courts deemed that the builders were liable financially for any misdeeds carried out by these adventurers, as unbenknownst to their employers the adventurers began to conduct raids on their volition and engage in general rowdy behavior. Following these court rulings, builders tended to head straight to the Ravenian authorities if they were unable to reach and put a stop to any misbehaving on the part of their hirelings, legally attesting to having unemployed them so as to ensure that they would not get fined for whatever misconduct the adventurers had gotten up to.

==Base of Operations==
The guildhall of the Builders' Guild was the [[Hall of Five Arches]], located along [[Moorland Ride]] in the city's [[Ravens Bluff/Uptown District|Uptown District]].

==Relationships==
[[Ambassador Carrague]] long had a sour opinion of the Builders' Guild, on account of its former guild leader Raven TenTolliver being a former member of Carrague's adventuring company that had parted ways on negative terms.

The [[De Sheers]], a wealthy [[Nobility of Ravens Bluff|noble house]] of Ravens Bluff that owned a great deal of property within the city was known to often underwrite the expenses of both the Builders' Guild and [[Cartsmans' Guild]].

==History==
The guild experience a significant financial boom in the wake of the Three Women War. The upsurge in work contracts left them scrambling to find additional skilled laborers to meet all the demands, as well as time enough for them to get some sleep.

Around the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the [[Stonemasons' Guild]] hired some adventurers to investigate the Cartsmans' Guild, to whom they were in conflict with at the time. The adventurers returned to them with a fabricated story of the Builders' Guild being in collusion with the Cartsmans' to slow down all stonework construction in the city, snubbing them and thus ensuring wood would become the preferred building material. This falsification led to the conflict between the two guilds to further inflame.
