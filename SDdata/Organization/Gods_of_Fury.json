        "mainbody": "The Gods of Fury was a collective term for a group of evil, chaotic, and destructive deities traditionally led by Talos, the Destroyer. Together, they wrought destruction and inspired fear in order to compel mortals to pay tribute to them.\nPrior to the Spellplague, the Gods of Fury were Talos, plus Auril, the Frostmaiden, Malar, the Beastlord, and Umberlee, the Bitch Queen. \nFollowing the events of the Stormstar Requiem&mdashwhen Talos was subsumed by Gruumsh and had disappeared&mdashAuril, Malar, and Umberlee were known as the Three Furies, and they owed their allegiance to Silvanus.\nBy the late 15 century DR, Talos had returned and Umberlee turned him and Malar against Auril. Umberlee had grown resentful of Auril, or perhaps of her domain of ice and its chilling effect on water and the sea. In the wake of this fracturing of the old alliance, Auril fled to Icewind Dale on Toril. She briefly returned to her divine realm during the events of the Second Sundering before returning to Toril once more, thus causing the so-called Everlasting Rime.\nCategoryDeities by group\nCategoryPantheons\nai9sgvhkmzscgscu8630hbpcbjfx6nx"
