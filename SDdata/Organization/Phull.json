        "mainbody": "House '''Phull''' was a noble house of [[Waterdeep]] and one of the older noble families in the city.  Around [[1440 DR]] [[Mhairdren Phull]] purchased the original Phull's title of nobility from the impoverished family.  Shortly after the new Phulls moved into the family mansion, Mhairdren's second son, [[Blakrho Phull]], murdered his elder brother and blamed the crime on his younger brother.  The frame-up was initially believed by the city guard, however, when Mhairdren caught Blakrho beating his mother it became obvious that Blakrho was the culprit.  Blakrho fled Waterdeep to pursue a life of banditry in the Southern [[Sword Coast]] region.{{Cite dungeon/190/Eye on the Realms: The Wild Lords}}",
