        "mainbody": "The Funada clan were the ruling family in Nakamaru in Wa around 1357 DR. The Funada held the position of daimyo and of many key city officers, plus some members held important positions in local temples. They kept a close eye over their vassals thanks to their allegiance with the ninja of Hijo clan and to many lesser samurai families, who wanted to improve their own positions. Furthermore, the Funada had the aid ofÂ the mysterious wu jen Taichi. The power of the Funada came from their close bond with Shogun Matasuuri Nagahide."
