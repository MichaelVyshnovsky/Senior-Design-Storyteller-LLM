The '''Sisterhood of the Silver Fire''', also known the '''Sorority of the Silver Fire''', was an all-female order dedicated to [[Mystra]], the Lady of Mystery, and opposing the [[Cult of the Dragon]], [[Sammaster]], and other fallen [[Chosen of Mystra]].

==Organization==
The Sisterhood operated in secrecy and counted exclusively [[human]] and [[half-elven]] women among its members. The order was dedicated to the [[magic]] school of incantation and the membership consisted of [[incantatrix]]es, [[mage]]s , and [[sorceress]]es. The organization's goal was opposing Sammaster's madness and destruction of the ''[[Tome of the Dragon]]'' and the Cult's [[dracolich]]es.

In theory, many members of the Sorority did not care for the Cult of the Dragon's fate. However, the quest to undo Sammaster's madness and magical corruption constantly led the order's sisters into direct conflict with the Cult. The death toll among the members was high, but the women knew risks and celebrated great successes over the centuries of the Sisterhood's existence. Perhaps the greatest success was the fact that the [[Keepers of the Secret Hoard]] still did not know of the Sisterhood's existence as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

Being a clandestine order, Sisters of the Silver Fire rarely operated in groups of more than three. Each Sister was committed to searching for spells from copies of the ''Tome of the Dragon'' and destroying the [[dracolich|Sacred Ones]] of the Cult. These goals were achieved through intense use of [[the Art]] and mundane means. These investigations often attracted the attention of the Cult of the Dragon and eventually brought members of the two factions to open conflict. Once an experienced Sister accumulated enough information, she enlisted the aid of [[adventurers]] to launch a precise attack on her target. Each such conflict could only end in two outcomes, either the Sister of the Silver Fire was killed by the Cult, or a Cult's cell was destroyed by the Sister.

Ironically, the Sisterhood of the Silver Fire used many of the ''[[metamagic]]'' spells developed by the young Sammaster prior to him becoming a fallen Chosen.

==History==
The first incarnation of the Sisterhood of the Silver Fire was assembled in the city of [[Myth Drannor]] by [[Anorrweyn Evensong]] of [[House Durothil]]. The elven wizardess became inspired by [[Elminster]]'s deeds in the ancient City of Songs that led to it opening gates to other peoples and blossoming into its Golden Age. She adopted the worship of Mystra and built several [[Shrine of the Silver Fire|Shrines of the Silver Fire]] throughout the city. That incarnation of the arcane Sisterhood almost certainly perished in the destruction of Myth Drannor during the [[Weeping War]] ([[711 DR|711]]–[[714 DR]]).

The Sorority's second founding date was the {{YearlinkName|985}}. The order was assembled by a half-elven incantatrix named [[Fetitia Ledora]] (a daughter of [[Alustriel Silverhand]]) and [[Yhelfanna the Masked]] (a [[Rashemi]] [[Hathran]]). Independently, both women had clashed with the results of Sammaster's foul influence in the prior decade. Dracoliches sought to destroy both women's homes, [[Everlund]] and [[Rashemen]], and both investigated the origins of the draconic undead, discovering the Keepers of the Secret Hoard. The taint on the [[Weave]] led Fetitia and Yhelfanna to the nation of [[Sembia]] and the Cult's hidden temples.

Yhelfanna attacked the Sembian cell of the Cult first, and later, Fetitia joined the battle. The women quickly allied against a common enemy and combined their arcane powers to dissolve the cell and destroy its copy of the ''Tome of the Dragon''. Both women remained allied and soon after grew into the Sorority of the Silver Fire.

In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, a group of the Sisters of the Silver Fire became aware of the Cult of the Dragon's taking over the ruins of Myth Drannor. Most of the sisters fell to the dangers of the ruined city, leaving only [[Kellan]] and the Sisters' guide [[Bronwyn]] alive. Eventually, they joined a group of adventurers who set out against the Cult and recovered a magical weapon that belonged to one of the deceased sisters—''[[Flame Blade (short sword)|Flame Blade]]''.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Sister of the Silver Fire [[Mavanna Blackspine]] had been searching for a copy of the ''Tome of the Dragon'' in the [[Vilhon Reach]] for more than four years. Rumors of the Cult's operations in the city of [[Hlondeth]] attracted Mavanna's attention, especially the creation of [[ur-histachii]] via magics found in Sammaster's tome. The Sister of the Silver Fire was recruiting adventurers in [[Chondath]] bold enough to go against the Dragon Cult, which was aligned with the city's ruling [[House Extaminos]]. One thing remained unknown to Mavanna Blackspine—the rumors were nothing but a setup orchestrated by the Emerald Boa of the Vilhon [[Medusanna Mhairdaul]], the ambitious High Priestess of the [[Cathedral of Emerald Scales]], as a ploy was to hurt [[Dediana Extaminos]], Medusanna's political rival.

Another plot that involved the Sisterhood in 1370 DR unfolded in the [[Delimbyr Vale]]. [[Cynmelin D'Athia]] believed that the Cult of the Dragon had begun transporting unspeakable riches into the lair of [[white dragon]] [[Ghaulantatra]] and were possibly seeking to place a dracolich into the white dragon's lair. In reality, the Cult had become involved in an old war between a white dragon and a [[beholder]], both turning undead by 1370 DR.

By the late 14{{th}} century DR, several ranking leaders of the Sorority of the Silver Fire were killed in the line of duty, leaving younger and less experienced women in charge. The Council of Seven in 1370 DR was helmed by [[Ioelena]] of the Argent Robes, [[Fieryat Ildacer]], and [[Blethran Lhylbihi]] the Gray Witch.

==Members==
*[[Dammasae]], a senior member of the Sorority of the Silver Fire and a wielder of ''[[spellfire]]''. She orchestrated the demise of at least two dracoliches and worked alongside adventurer [[Gorstag]], the adoptive father of [[Shandril Shessair]].
