'''Trade of Blades''' guild was a mercenary organization and freehouse from the city of [[Neverwinter]].

==Base of Operations==
The Trade of Blades' guildhall was located in the busy [[Neverwinter/Protector's Enclave|Protector's Enclave]] district of Neverwinter.

==Relationships==
The guild had a strained relationship with the city of Neverwinter due to their aggressive strategy in attracting and advocating for mercenaries and sellswords. [[Augustavus Cale]], the founder of the guild self-published a book of the same name as his organization - ''[[The Trade of Blades]]'', in which he issued veiled threats of mayhem and unrest if the needs of their mercenaries were not met.

==History==
The guild was founded by Augustavus Cale sometime before [[1372 DR]]. Under his avid rule, the guild grew and attracted numerous mercenaries and the Trade of Blades gave them accommodations within the walls of Neverwinter.

The guild was active dewing the [[Wailing Death]] epidemic of 1372 DR and several of the guild's hirelings offered their aid to the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] in the investigation of the deadly disease. Later, the members of the Trade of Blades participated in the short war between Neverwinter and [[Luskan]].
