Trade of Blades guild was a mercenary organization and freehouse from the city of Neverwinter.
The Trade of Blades guildhall was located in the busy Protectors Enclave district of Neverwinter.
The guild had a strained relationship with the city of Neverwinter due to their aggressive strategy in attracting and advocating for mercenaries and sellswords. Augustavus Cale, the founder of the guild self-published a book of the same name as his organization - The Trade of Blades, in which he issued veiled threats of mayhem and unrest if the needs of their mercenaries were not met.
The guild was founded by Augustavus Cale sometime before 1372 DR. Under his avid rule, the guild grew and attracted numerous mercenaries and the Trade of Blades gave them accommodations within the walls of Neverwinter.
The guild was active dewing the Wailing Death epidemic of 1372 DR and several of the guilds hirelings offered their aid to the Hero of Neverwinter in the investigation of the deadly disease. Later, the members of the Trade of Blades participated in the short war between Neverwinter and Luskan.
