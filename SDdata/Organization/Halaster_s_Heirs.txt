Halasters Heirs was a school of wizardry established by two former apprentices of the "Mad Mage" Halaster Blackcloak. It was located on the first level of Undermountain, not far from the entrance in the common room of the Yawning Portal Inn.
As of the , Halasters Heirs had forty members, the vast majority of whom were human, with a pair of shield dwarves and a couple other non-humans. The reputation of the leaders, Trobriand and Muiral, drew applicants from across the North and up and down the Sword Coast. Their were a number of members from the nobility of Waterdeep as well. As an organization, they could muster up to about 15,000 gp in resources if necessary.
When accepted, the apprentices of the school were required to pay 250 gold pieces and dues of 25 gp per month. In addition, each member was required to create for the school one magic item worth at least 100 gp per month, although the guild did assist with the cost of raw materials for constructs, reducing the out-of-pocket expense by ten percent. In exchange, the students learned new spells (some of which were rare to unique) and techniques and could work on their own projects after the tithe to the school was paid.
A major source of income was from the sale of the items crafted by the students. Halasters Heirs was a well known source for magic weapons, armor, and other magic items including constructs. They could also be hired to cast spells.
The arcanists academy was located on the Dungeon Level of Undermountain, not far from the main access point in the Yawning Portal Inn. Access to the goblin domain was granted to those who knew the location of the secret door, what sequence of knocks would call the guard, and what phrases to utter, in goblin. Adventurers were not particularly welcome.
The Yawning Portal Inn was located on Rainrun Street in the Castle Ward between Waterdeep Castle and Snail Street.
Halasters Heirs had a wide variety of magic items, weapons, armor, and constructs, but the selection was limited by what was in stock and what the students produced. The special spells that apprentices could learn included Halasters blacksphere, Halasters fetch I through VI, Halasters grappling hand, Halasters image swap, Halasters light step, Halasters shaking hand, Halasters teleport cage, Trobriands baleful teleport, Trobriands crystalbrittle, and Trobriands glassee.
The academy had an agreement with the Sluggard Tribe to allow safe passage for members to and from the school to the entry room below the Yawning Portal Inn. The Agents of the Eye were actively trying to take over or drive the school out of Undermountain.
The name "Halasters Heirs" came from the term used to refer to the original seven apprentices of the Mad Mage that joined him in taking over the halls of Undermountain Trobriand and Murial were two of the seven. After the events of Halasters Higharvestide in the —in which Trobriand was driven out of his chambers by his own creations and Murial was unleashed on the streets of Waterdeep—Trobriand convinced Murial to join forces and establish a residency on the first level where the aura of magical madness was weakest. There, they could continue their work without being bothered by the authorities and distracted by insanity. Shortly thereafter, they were joined by another of Halasters former apprentices, Nandel Greenwood, and word of a unique and elite (and evil) arcane academy began to spread and attract those who sought advancement in their dark pursuits.
Much advanced magic was disrupted by the Spellplague of 1385 DR and Trobriand disappeared during this time to an unknown fate. Under these circumstances, the school disbanded.
