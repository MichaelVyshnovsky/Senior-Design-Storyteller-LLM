        "mainbody": "mentioned above, the Faerûnian pantheon was a single-sphere pantheon. The reason why gods deliberately concentrated their work on one single world at the exclusion of others was that this way they could shut out deities from other worlds entering and infringing on their home turf.",

            "Membership": "The Faerûnian pantheon was a pantheon of [[deities]]. Pantheons were a group of deities who were worshiped by people who shared one characteristic, for example sharing the same cultural or racial background. In the Faerûnian pantheon's case the believers' shared characteristic was a geographic one, people who lived in those parts of the continent Faerûn where other pantheons did not hold sway were the believers.",
            "Hierarchy": "The [[Circle of Greater Powers]] were the twelve deities that led the pantheon. The leadership was a loose matter and was more of administrative nature. Apart from this, there was little hierarchy in the Faerûnian pantheon except for the one the gods created among themselves. A unique trait of the Faerûnian pantheon was that deities with similar portfolios clustered in a hierarchic relationship."

        "Base of Operations": "The Faerûnian pantheon had―as it was normal for single-sphere pantheons―no base of operations. The members held their [[divine realm]]s where it suited them most. The closest to a base of operations was the pavilion of [[Cynosure]], a [[demiplane]] where the Circle of the Greater Powers met.",
        "Relationships": "As mentioned above, the Faerûnian pantheon was subject to Ao and tried to execute his rule of Balance.\n\nAs mentioned above, single-sphere pantheons were good at defending themselves from infringement from potential external rivals. This came at the cost of interplanar unimportance, Toril's deities were, as deities who were worshiped only on a backwater plane like Toril, unimportant deities on the interplanar political landscape. However, the rate at which their importance grew was equal to that of the most vibrant of pantheons. That said, the Faerûnian pantheon ever becoming an important force on the interplanar landscape was considered unlikely at best.\n\nThe Faerûnian pantheon as a whole had special relationships with the [[Chultan pantheon]]. The pact between the two was quite simple, [[Ubtao]] would look out for [[Dendar]] while the Faerûnian pantheon would leave Ubtao's turf alone for this service.",
