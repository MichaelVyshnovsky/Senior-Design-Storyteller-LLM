The Dawnbringer Company was a band of adventurers from Waterdeep.
In 1024 DR, they plundered the crypt of Uruth Ukrypts orcs. In response to this, the Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge formed an orc horde named the Broken Bone with the intent of destroying Waterdeep, but they were attacked by the dragon Lhammaruntosz and defeated.
