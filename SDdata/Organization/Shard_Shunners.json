        "mainbody": "The '''Shard Shunners''' were a gang of [[halfling]] [[wererat]]s operating in [[Waterdeep]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR. Their name came from their refusal to deal in [[silver]], called [[Shard (coin)|shards]] in Waterdeep, because of their wererat nature.",
        "Activities": "The Shard Shunners committed petty crimes around the city. Around [[1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} they were pickpocketing patrons at the [[Endshift Tavern]] in the [[Field Ward]] as retribution for a disagreement between the tavern owner and one of their members.\n\nThey were hired by [[Emmek Frewn]] to harass a group of adventurers. The adventurers had reopened [[Trollskull Tavern]], a bar that he had personally tried to buy but was outbid. He opened his own establishment nearby, [[Frewn's Brews]], and felt that the Tavern was too near to his own business.",
        "Base of Operations": "The gang operated from a halfling-owned hostel on [[Spices Street]] in the [[Dock Ward]].",
        "Relationships": "There was a tenuous alliance between the Shard Shunners and the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]]. The hostel that served as a base of operations for the Shard Shunners shared a cellar entrance to [[Waterdeep/Sewers|the sewers]] very near to one of the Xanathar's underground hideouts.",
        "Members": "* [[Roscoe Underbough]]\n* [[Kelso Fiddlewick]]\n* [[Dasher Snobeedle]]\n* [[Danika Fiddlewick]]\n* [[Brynn Hilltopple]]"
