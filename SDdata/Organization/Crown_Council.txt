The '''Crown Council''' was the ruling council of [[Relmaur]], [[Laerakond]], as of [[1479 DR]].

== Background ==
The Crown Council was established by High Crown [[Harangor Urlingscar]] to allow all the prominent Relmorn [[dragonborn]] clans, Clans [[Clan Urlingscar|Urlingscar]], [[Clan Belarrak|Belarrak]], and [[Clan Garandorn|Garandorn]], to participate in the government of the kingdom. 

Members of the Council were called Crown-swords. There were six members in the Council, two from each clan.
