        "History": "The house made history during the last days of the [[Torlath]] dynasty, when their archrivals, the [[Braethar]]s, installed their respective puppet claimant. The Braethars had King [[Niskam the Doomed]] killed and replaced with King [[Rhor the Lackey]] in the {{YearlinkName|1094}}, and the Villaxes responded in the {{YearlinkName|1095}}, by slaying him and usurping the throne with King [[Dornak the Puppet King]], who didn't last the year before being killed himself. The situation was ultimately resolved with King [[Erdhinn Wavegold I]] taking control of the realm."
