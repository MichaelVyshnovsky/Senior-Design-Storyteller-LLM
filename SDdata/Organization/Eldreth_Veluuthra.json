        "mainbody": "The '''Eldreth Veluuthra''' (''Victorious Blade of the People'', also sometimes '''Eldreth Veluuthara'''), formed in [[262 DR]] and still active as of [[1374 DR]], was a group of [[elf|elves]] dedicated to the removal of all [[human]]s from [[Faerûn]]. Its main areas of activity were ancient elven forests, including the [[Ardeep Forest]], the [[Border Forest]], the [[Chondalwood]], [[Cormanthor]], the [[High Forest]], the [[Moonwood]], [[Neverwinter Woods]] and the [[Winterwood]].",
        "History": "The incident that kickstarted the organization’s formation was [[Coronal]] [[Eltargrim Irithyl|Eltargrim Irithyl’s]] decision to open [[Myth Drannor]] to non-[[elf|elves]] upon its foundation in [[261 DR]]. Some elves at that time pointed at the danger of such a decision due to past bad relationships with [[human|humans]], like those they had with [[Netheril]], the supposed humans’ inclination to take land from elves, and their supposed inability to live in a given piece of land without despoiling it. \n\nIn [[262 DR]], these dissidents, five major elven houses, [[Bharaclaiev]], [[Hyshaanth]], [[Rhaevaern]], [[Starym]] and [[Tellynnan]], and about a dozen of minor elven houses left Myth Drannor in order to not allow social strife to develop into all out war. Outside of the capital, these dissidents founded the Eldreth Veluuthra, though at that time they neither called themselves such nor was their purpose at that time of genocidal nature. Their purpose at that time was to catalogue what they categorized as “humans’ crime against nature“ as well as to conduct philosophical discussions with other elves based on this catalogue to determine the humans’ place in the natural world. The result was to call humans vermin. \n\nThe organization's formally founded itself after the [[Weeping War]] ([[711 DR]]–[[714 DR]]) calling themselves by the name Eldreth Veluuthra. A number of raids in [[757 DR]] were aimed to lead up to a final battle against the humans.\n\nAfter the [[Elven Court]] was abandoned in the [[Retreat]], the Eldreth Veluuthra set about preparing to take the forest of [[Cormanthor]] for themselves, starting with the Elven Court. They were driven away by the [[drow]] of [[House Jaelre]].\n\nIn [[1277 DR]], King [[Errilam I]] of [[Tethyr]] and Prince [[Dhanar the Younger|Dhanar]] of [[Amn]] died in a \"hunting accident\", an assassination orchestrated by the Eldreth Veluuthra.\n\nNotable about the Eldreth Veluuthra's history was, that they never had, throughout their history from their foundation to the 14th century DR, meaningful success at reversing or stopping human expansion.",
        "Relationships": "The organization saw humans as vermin. It maintained secretive methods while still benefitting from good funding. Some elves would openly encourage cooperation and friendship with humans while simultaneously supplying the Eldreth Veluuthra with weapons, supplies and money. Although outsiders might view the organization as evil, its members believe that they are doing good by ridding the world of humans and saving their fellow elves from human dangers.\n\nOnly few humans knew that the Eldreth Veluuthra existed at all.{{Cite web/Tar'Ael Veluuthra}} Among those who knew were the [[Harpers]]. On one hand, the Eldreth Veluuthra suffered setbacks at the hand of the spies' infiltration, on the other, the Harpers supported them at remaining secret. The background for this was that the Eldreth Veluuthra were elves. The Harpers didn't want to make information public, that could tarnish the elves' reputation and could lead to their disadvantage and covered up the Eldreth Veluuthra's crimes.\n\nIn general, elves who were not members of the Eldreth Veluuthra saw the organization as an unnecessary embarrassment. Its eradication is believed to have been prevented due to certain members of elven high society who remained in its favor.\n\nThe organization generally benefitted from relations with the [[centaur]]s, some [[fey]] and [[satyr]]s, although they were not above teaming up with evil races in order to fulfil a goal. Over the course of the organization's history, the [[Harpers]] ruined their plans on numerous occasions, and the Eldreth Veluuthra delighted in ambushing Harpers as a result. They also targetted human [[ranger]]s in general, since they were often the precursors to human encroachment in an area.\n\nSome members opposed attacking human [[druid]]s, since druids were aspiring to the elven ideal that the organization was trying hard to protect, \n\nThey viewed [[half-elf|half-elves]] as abominations, alongside fey'ri, and were committed to wiping them out along with humans. \n\nThey had some ties with the [[church of Vhaeraun]] and were capable of working with drow together against humans. Some members favored making peace with the [[drow]] and accept their [[cleric]]s to counter their chronic shortage of healing magic, although this was not a popular proposition.\n\nThe organization was opposed to some traditional elven enemies such as [[beholder]]s, evil [[dragon]]s, [[gnoll]]s, [[goblinoid]]s and [[orc]]s.",
        "Religion": "The Eldreth Veluuthra solely worshiped the [[elven pantheon]], although the pantheon's good-aligned deities did not appreciate their being worshiped by the Eldreth Veluuthra, and as a result, there were no [[cleric]]s in the organization. Members of the organization believed that they will one day be recognised by a deity in the elven pantheon, and the most likely candidate was [[Corellon Larethian]].\n\nUnder instruction from the ice lich [[Lossarwyn]], the organization was able to harness nature's divine power, and this led to [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s emerging.",
        "Organization": "The organization was cellular and leadership of each cell was decided upon by its members. If a leader could not be removed by diplomatic means, approval from the [[Vel'Nikeryma]] was sought to take further measures.\n\nCells each operated differently with different rules under their respective leaders, but few took a militaristic approach. Instead, members went about their daily lives, working or maintaining families, and took up duties when called for. Although there were a few adventuring companies, these did not last long due to the high casualties involved in such a cell style.\n\nIt was possible for established members of the Eldreth Veluuthra to request agent status with the [[Vel'Nikeryma]], and take on duties anywhere in Faerûn. Agents would have to pass on the information they learned, and donate a portion of their treasure, to their superiors. They gained access to passwords, handshakes and symbols that could help identify them to other agents anywhere in Faerûn. An agent arriving in a cell's area would gain access to their supplies and gain their shelter. Only if the agent requested a valuable item or stayed more than a tenday would the cell's leader be justified in asking for a task or favor in return.",
        "Recruitment": "Only elves are permitted to join the Eldreth Veluuthra, which prohibits [[drow]] and [[half-elf|half-elves]] from joining. Traditionally the [[sun elf|sun elves]] have been the most numerous although as of 1374 DR, [[wild elf]] applicants have become more common. [[Moon elf|Moon elves]] are fairly numerous, and there are a few [[wood elf|wood elves]] and [[sea elf|sea elves]].\n\nThe two main areas of recruitment for the organiztion are amongst the mature and wealthy, and amongst the young and poor, especially those that are also disillusioned. The young and poor make up the organization's fighting force, while the wealthy are needed to spread the organization's reputations and agendas amongst high society. The wild and green elves are the specialists in the organization.\n\nIn order to join the Eldreth Veluuthra, one must be observed for a time. Those who openly seek membership of the organization are treated with suspicion (due to a history of problems with the [[Harpers]]). Once the true agenda of a potential new recruit has been ascertained, through observation by normal and magical means, he or she is approached and invited to join. Most new recruits are family members, because the trust of a family helps to maintain the secrecy of the organization. Some non-family recruits are treated with suspicion and have a hard time settling in.\n\nOnce a member, an individual is bound by a vow of secrecy and a vow to punish any other member who breaks this vow. The vow is life-long and can never be broken.",
        "Areas of operation": {
            "Ardeep Forest": "As of 1374 DR, two cells operated in the [[Ardeep Forest]], one chasing down worshipers of [[Eilistraee]] near the [[Dancing Dell]] and the [[Ladystone]]; the other guarding [[Phalorm]]'s ruins. Operatives were occasionally sent to the [[House of Stone]] on treasure hunting missions.",
            "The Border Forest": "As of 1374 DR, the Eldreth Veluuthra in the [[Border Forest]] were allied with the [[fey]] in this area in opposition of the [[Zhentarim]]. Two small cells operated here: one conducting raids on the [[Daggerdale]] border and the other conducting ambushes on Zhentarim agents.",
            "Chondalwood": "As of 1374 DR, many of the creatures of the [[Chondalwood]], such as [[centaur]]s, [[ghostwise halfling]]s and [[satyr]]s, were sympathetic to the cause of the Eldrath Veluuthra, and the [[wild elf|wild elves]] provided them with support and shelter.",
            "Cormanthor": "Due to being driven out of the forest in the past (see [[#History|History]]), [[Cormanthor]] was a problem for the Eldreth Veluuthra. As of 1374 DR, the organization took to using [[drow]] disguises while attacking humans, to further incite hatred between the two species. Agents operated near [[Bristar]] and [[Moonrise Hill]] in [[Deepingdale]] and near the [[Tangled Trees]], whilst the area of the [[Vale of Lost Voices]] was sacred to the organization. There were numerous agents in [[Semberholme]], who aimed to curry favor with the elven population there.",
            "Evereska": "As of 1374 DR, a powerful cell operated in [[Evereska]], quietly promoting the organization's causes and spreading propaganda. It also aimed to earn money and supplies to help the cells operating in the [[Graycloak Hills]].",
            "Evermeet": "As of 1374 DR, a loose information-gathering cell operated on [[Evermeet]], also working to gain support amongst the [[sun elf|sun elves]].",
            "Graycloak Hills": "As of 1374 DR, in the [[Graycloak Hills]], tolerance for the Eldreth Veluuthra was greater than elsewhere, because the threat from [[Anauroch]] and the [[City of Shade]] was deemed too great to reject any ally.",
            "The Gray Forest": "As of 1374 DR, a small cell operates in the [[Gray Forest]], launching attacks against the native [[hobgoblin]] population and occasionally warning them of human encroachment.",
            "Hullack Forest": "In [[1391 DR]], the Eldreth Veluuthra sieze control of the [[Hullack_Forest]]. [[Cormyr]] tries to regain control in [[1394 DR]] in a brief conflict, but more pressing threats from [[Netheril]] and [[Sembia]] forces [[Azoun_V|King Azoun V]] to redirect its efforts, and the Eldreth Veluuthra maintain control of the forest. <ref>",
            "The High Forest": "As of 1374 DR, Eldreth Veluuthra operated several cells in the [[High Forest]], watching over [[Hellgate Keep]] and fighting back against the encroachment of humans. Around this time, the organization had a particular interest in the human settlement of [[Olostin's Hold]] due to its inhabitants' integration with nature, which is notable for humans. The organization was allied with [[Turlang]] and the forest's [[centaur]] and [[wild elf]] populations. A common goal shared between the Eldreth Veluurtha and [[Lossarwyn]] of the [[Dire Wood]] meant that the organization was seeking him as an ally.",
            "The Methwood": "As of 1374 DR, a cell in the [[Methwood]] was led by [[Talindra Amalith]] of the [[Vel'Nikeryma]].",
            "The Misty Forest": "Although prior to 1374 DR the [[Misty Forest]] was a relatively safe caravan route between [[Boareskyr Bridge]], [[Daggerford]] and [[Secomber]], around this year, a cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra began operations in this area by setting up a base and planning ambushes.",
            "The Moonwood": "As of 1374 DR, [[lycanthrope]]s in the [[Moonwood]] constituted a cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra, but often had problems with the [[People of the Black Blood]], who benefitted from greater numbers superior organization.",
            "Neverwinter Woods": "One of the oldest and largest cells of the organization was active in [[Neverwinter Woods]] around 1374 DR. Several other cells of a lesser size operated in the surrounding area.",
            "Urlingwood": "The cells in [[Urlingwood]] at the eastern extend of the organization's reach were used as punishment and any members who committed a crime not serious enough to result in execution were sent here. As of 1374 DR the Eldreth Veluuthra in this area were tasked with removing the [[witch]]es from the wood.",
            "The Wealdath": "As of 1374 DR, cells operated by the [[Suldusk]] and [[Elmanesse]] elven tribes operated in the [[Wealdath]], tasked with protecting their traditional tribal homelands. The Vel'Nikeryma were also interested in reclaiming the [[mythal]] at [[Myth Rhynn]].",
            "The Winterwood": "The [[Winterwood]] cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra was traditionally almost all [[wild elf|wild elves]]. As of 1374 DR the cell would take only defensive action, protecting its borders against human threats, while concentrating on driving out the green dragon [[Foilsunder]]."
