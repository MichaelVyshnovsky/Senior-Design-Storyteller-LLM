The '''Bards of Nun''' was given to the trio of [[bard]]s who participated in the [[Rotting War]]s of [[Chondath]], each with the opposing armies of [[Arrabar]], [[Reth]], and [[Hlath]].

==Activities==
The Bards of Nun participated in the conflict and recorded the events for posterity independent from each other. Most notably, the bards' chronicles included a rare appearance of a divine being. Independently from each other, the Bards of Nun recorded the appearance of the Lord of Battles – [[Tempus]] upon the [[Fields of Nun]]. The avatar, or possibly a vision, manifested himself before the infamous historic [[Battle of Nun]]. The deity rode on a skeletal [[steed]] that exuded blood dripping over the future battlefield. Each of the three armies' generals took Tempus' presence as a good omen, seeing the Lord of Battles atop a white stallion.
