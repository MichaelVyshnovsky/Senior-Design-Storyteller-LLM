The '''Old lodge''' was a unique lodge of [[Rashemaar berserkers]] based in the town of [[Taporan]] as of the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Base of Operations==
The Old lodge's longhouse hugged the waterfront of the [[River Tir]].

==Activities==
Unlike other berserker lodges, the Old Lodge was heavily involved with running the town of Taporan in the name of the [[Iron Lord]].

==Organization==
Members of the Old Lodge were extremely skilled in their craft, having mastered the fighting techniques of at least three other berserker lodges before being recruited to join their ranks. The Master of the Old Lodge as of mid–14{{th}} century DR was [[Jhorrgel|Jhorrgel the Black]].
