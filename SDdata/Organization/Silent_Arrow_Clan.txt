The Silent Arrow Clan was a group of jungle giants found deep in the rain forests of east Zakhara in 1367 DR.
The jungle giants made the fatal mistake of attacking the necromancers who claimed the ruins of Ysawis, believing them to be weak and puny. As a result, the entire clan was slain and reanimated to serve as an elite zombie guard for the necromancers Jade Palace.
The Silent Arrow clan claimed territory in the Grey Jungle near the ruins of Ysawis.
