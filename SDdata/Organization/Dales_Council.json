        "mainbody": "he Dales Council was a meeting between the governments of the various dales of the Dalelands that met once a year at Midwinter to decide on important matters of their lands. Each dale sent a delegate to the council to agree upon matters such as trade routes, foreign relations, common defense and various objections between the dales. In the 14 century DR, it was hosted by alternating dales, but was eventually permanently seated in Ashabenford within Mistledale.\nThe Dales Council was formed after Aencar Burlisk, the self-proclaimed King of the Dales, was defeated in the , and his campaign to unite the dales under one rule was ended.\nDuring the late 14 century DR, the meetings mainly concerned the growing threat of drow in Cormanthor and the Zhents, but also included aggression from Sembia and border disputes between neighboring dales.\nThe expansionism of Netheril was the direct cause of four Dales leaving the Dales Council in the 15 century. In 1418 DR, Featherdale was bloodlessly annexed by Sembia when investors bought the majority of the land and replaced the administration. In 1420 DR, Tasseldale was overtly invaded by a Sembian mercenary army. In 1422 DR, High Dale responded to the inaction of the Council by joining the nation of Cormyr as a protectorate. Throughout this period, Scardale was gradually infiltrated and then bloodily conquered by a Sembian mercenary army, adding it to Sembias holdings. In 1425 DR, the remaining Dales reaffirmed the Dales Compact and restored the Standing Stone as a sign of unity, and by 1479 DR, the city of Ashabenford in Mistledale had became the permanent seat of the Dales Council.\nSometime after 1479 DR, Scardale gained independence from Sembia and rejoined the Dales Council. After the defeat of Netheril in 1487 DR, Featherdale and Tasseldale also returned, quickly followed by High Dale separating from Cormyrs protection and rejoining as well."
