        "mainbody": "The '''Many-Arrows tribe''', also written as the '''Many Arrows tribe''', was the most powerful [[mountain orc]] tribe in [[the North]] and one of the most successful and notorious [[orc]] tribes in all of [[Faer√ªn]] during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. It was not a single tribe, but an amalgam of tribes subsumed by force into the tribe of [[Obould Many-Arrows]] or which dwelt within the [[Kingdom of Many-Arrows]].{{Cite dragon/429/Winning Races: Half-Orcs of the Many-Arrows Tribe|11-12}}",
        "Organization": "The Many-Arrows tribe comprised several tribes of orcs, and following the creation of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows, [[half-orc]]s as well. One such orc tribe was the [[Broken Arrow tribe]], to which the [[Obould dynasty]] belonged.\n\nThe Many-Arrows' symbol was a crudely rendered [[humanoid]] skull that was pierced by three [[arrow]]s.",
        "Activities": {
            "Torture": "Prior to the founding of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows, the Many Arrows orcs were renowned for their cruelty. Non-orc prisoners were branded as [[slave]]s and either put to work in mines&mdash;where they quickly died of injury or starvation&mdash;or were shackled and forced to serve an orc master, who was liable to torture or kill them on a whim. The exception to this was [[elves]], who were typically killed brutally. Children, [[halfling]]s, and [[gnome]]s, were tormented as a form of entertainment, while and anyone the orcs regarded as exotic was caged and pressed for information about treasure. If a victim claimed to know of a secret cache of treasure, they might be freed from immediate captivity to be allowed to guide the orcs to the location, with human mercenaries sometimes being employed to follow the person into cities or other places where orcs dared not go. Inevitably, the orcs' plan was to claim the treasure and then kill whoever had led them to it.",
            "Feasts and Festivals": "Celebrations of orcish holidays and [[Orc pantheon|gods]] were marked by great feasts at which all could gorge themselves on food and drink as well as enjoy the killing of elves. Such festivities were used by King Obould to placate his followers and prevent uprisings, but required a large amount of [[money]], which in turn led him both to open trade with [[human]]s and to order his guards to steal from his own orc raiders.",
            "Trade": "The Many-Arrows tribe was long known for manufacturing orcish [[weapons]] and [[armor]], which they traded with other orc tribes and beyond.{{Cite dragon/429/History Check: Dark Arrow Keep|5}} While they occupied the Citadel of Many Arrows prior to the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, they also were known to trade in illicit or stolen goods as well as slaves."
        },
        "Tactics": "The tribe used scouts and skirmishers to observe and test enemy defenses and to map the terrain of future battles in order to secure strategic advantages. When preparing for war against the cities of the North, they constructed great [[siege engine]].",
        "Base of Operations": "Prior to the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, the tribe was based in the [[Citadel of Many Arrows]]. After being driven from this fortress-city, they retreated to [[Dark Arrow Keep]], which would go on to become the capital of their [[Kingdom of Many Arrows]] through the late 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "Possessions": "They favored black [[scimitar]]s Some were known to carry&mdash;and sometimes to give as gifts&mdash;''[[orc stone]]s'', which could summon the spirits of orcish warriors in combat.",
        "Relationships": "The tribe had many enemies. Prior to their ouster from the Citadel of Many Arrows, their foes included all of the [[human]] and [[dwarf|dwarven]] realms of the North, and any non-orc who arrived in the Citadel without Obould's protection would end up dead: only a select few human and half-orc merchants and mercenaries tended to be allowed inside. They maintained spies in most human communities of the North, although they notably struggled to infiltrate [[Everlund]], [[Neverwinter]], and [[Silverymoon]]. They were also opposed to the forces of [[Hellgate Keep]], and came to regard other orcs with suspicion as their [[shaman]]s predicted that the Citadel would fall to orcish treachery.\n\nAfter they were driven from the Citadel, they became the most feared orcs in the North within just a few years. The folk of the [[Silver Marches]] were constantly on-guard for what they knew was an inevitable attack from Many-Arrows. They were also no friends to the [[tanarukk]]s of the North. During this time, the tribe grew by consolidating other tribes, and so internal restlessness and treachery remained a large concern, causing the orcs to spy on each other.\n\nAfter the signing of the [[Treaty of Garumn's Gorge]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, they entered into a tenuous peace with the realms of the North. While they remained enemies, they traded and even worked together on occasion, As of the 1470s DR, tensions had risen with neighboring [[Luruar]] and [[Mithral Hall]], they were warring with the [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s, and they had come into conflict with Neverwinter following an incursion by their raiders into the ruins of the north of that city. Their only notable ally at that time was [[Netheril]].",
        "History": {
            "Citadel of Many Arrows": "The Many-Arrows tribe had its roots in [[Dead Orc Pass]] in the [[Rauvin Mountains]]. The tribe took its name from the Citadel of Many Arrows, which was in turn named for the [[Battle of Many Arrows]] in which the orcs overran and claimed the Citadel from Silverymoon in the {{YearlinkName|1104}}. They ruled the Citadel for centuries, during which time they fended off numerous attacks from Silverymoon and [[Sundabar]]. By the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, and their numbers had swelled to 40,000, leaving them living in cramped and impoverished conditions. The threat of starvation drove many of them to beg, steal, or take up arms to raid caravans and capture slaves. Their raiders harried traffic on the roads between Silverymoon and Sundabar, and occasionally tested the defenses of the cities themselves. The ill-gotten goods from these raids were sold to [[evil]] human merchants (with many of these products finding their ways to Everlund). They also traded in orcish weapons and armor, which were produced in the Citadel using [[metal]] seized in raids or dug up by slaves.\n\nWhile it was long thought that the orcs were too numerous to dislodge from their Citadel,",
            "Dark Arrow Keep": "Reduced to only about 4,500 survivors, and for a short time, it was unknown whether King Obould had survived his injuries. In fact he had, and he led a few hundred of his best warriors to capture Dark Arrow Keep&mdash;an old orcish castle that had been claimed by [[giant]]s&mdash;and established this fortress as his new base. About half of the tribe moved into the fortress, while the rest settled in caves in the nearby mountains.\n\nWith his new citadel secured, Obould plotted to reclaim his old home from the dwarves. Soon, Obould's aspirations turned to the establishment of an orc empire large enough to be divided among his eight sons.",
            "Kingdom of Many-Arrows": "{{Main|Many-Arrows}}\nAs the people of a kingdom, the Many-Arrows orcs managed to coexist relatively peacefully with the humans of the North, although they continued to fight amongst each other and it was clear that peace was only tenuous at best. A century after the realm's founding, they had faced civil wars Nevertheless, the orcs of Many-Arrows gained renowned as the rare example of \"civilized\" orcs.\n\nIn the late 1470s DR, King [[Obould XVII]] sent a contingent of orcs led by [[Vansi Bloodscar]] to scout the ruins of Neverwinter, which had been destroyed by a [[cataclysm (Neverwinter)|cataclysm]] decades prior. However, Bloodscar defied her orders and instead led her troops to occupy parts of the northern half of the city. By the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, these orcs&mdash;including Bloodscar herself&mdash;had fallen under the sway of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]], and were effectively in open rebellion against Many-Arrows as they pursued their own interests.\n\nThe experiment with peace ended in the {{YearlinkName|1484}}, when the orcs marched on Luruar in the [[War of the Silver Marches]]. This conflict came about when the rightful heir to the throne, [[Lorgru]], was usurped by a warmonger called [[Hartusk]]. The war ended in the summer of the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, when Bruenor Battlehammer led an alliance of dwarves against Dark Arrow Keep, killing Chief Hartusk and capturing the city. Meanwhile, Lorgru was restored as the leader of Many-Arrows, and the kingdom's surviving forces rallied behind him. Although Lorgru desired to continue the legacy of living in relative peace with the realms to the south, Bruenor had lost faith in the ability for the orcs to coexist with the Silver Marches. He thus banished Lorgru and his followers into the mountains and completely leveled Dark Arrow Keep, thus ending the Kingdom of Many-Arrows. \n\nNevertheless, the Many-Arrows tribe was still by far the most powerful orc tribe in the Spine of the World, and remained famous for their legacies of both peace and war. As of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, a Many-Arrows hunting party might still be willing to parlay rather than fight, especially if greeted in the [[Orc language]] or offered a gift that could not be easily taken by force. Such hunting parties were known to range as far as [[Icewind Dale]]."
