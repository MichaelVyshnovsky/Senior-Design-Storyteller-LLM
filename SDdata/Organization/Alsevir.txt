'''House Alsevir''' was a very old [[Cormyr|Cormyrian]] noble house which rose to the nobility around [[200 DR]].

The family was thought to have died out but a distant branch of the family returned to Cormyr in [[1420 DR]] and took up residence in the old [[Bleth]] estate.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail}}

The family had built a considerable fortune as merchants before returning to Cormyr and, when they arrived in [[Suzail]], began buying their way into high society. Their penchant for throwing around [[currency|gold]] as well as their purchased titles earned them the dislike of [[House Crownsilver]].
