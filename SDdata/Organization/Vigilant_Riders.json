        "mainbody": "The '''Vigilant Riders''' was a military organization dedicated to [[Helm]] that patrolled the roads of the [[Sword Coast]] and surrounding [[Western Heartlands]] for a time during the midâ€”13{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were founded by the [[Helmite]] priest [[Garshond]], who envisioned an elite order of disciplined guardians that would ensure safe journey across the Realms.",
        "Organization": "The order was backed both financially and with membership by attendees of the [[Council of Helm]].",
        "Activities": "The Riders watched over and regularly patrolled the stretch of the [[Trade Way]] between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Baldur's Gate]], the [[Dusk Road]] that linked [[Elturel]] with [[Iriaebor]], and the many smaller roadways that linked smaller towns and villages between.",
        "Base of Operations": "They were headquartered within the [[Watchtower of the Vigilant]] in [[Harkstag]].",
        "Possessions": "For a time the Riders remained in possession of the ''[[Helm of Helm]]''.",
        "History": "Garshond established the Vigilant Riders some time after his famous victory in defense of Iriaebor in the {{YearlinkName|1264}}.\n\nThe Riders' efforts to keep safe the Heartlands drew the attention of local bandits as well as [[goblin]] and [[orc]] tribes in the region. In the {{YearlinkName|1266}}, these forces banded together and delivered a decisive blow against the Vigilant Riders in the [[Garshond's War#History|Battle of Skull Hill]]. They earned another victory the [[1267 DR|following year]] in the [[Garshond's War#History|Battle of Scattershields]].\n\nThe order's home of [[Harkstag]] was destroyed a decade later by a flight of [[green dragon]]s that laired within the [[Forest of Wyrms]]. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Watchtower of the Vigilant was then taken over by the [[yuan-ti]] of [[Najare]]."
