        "mainbody": "The '''Seldarine''' ([[Elvish]] for \"fellowship of brothers and sisters of the wood\") was the [[Elf|elven]] pantheon of gods that resided on the [[astral dominion]] of [[Arvandor]] under the leadership of [[Corellon Larethian]].<ref>",
        "Members": "The many members of the Seldarine included:\n* Greater gods:\n**[[Corellon Larethian]], leader of the Seldarine; he was the elven god of magic, warfare, music, art, and crafts.\n** [[Angharradh]], consort to Corellon; commonly believed to be a combination of three other elven goddesses ([[Sehanine Moonbow]], [[Aerdrie Faenya]], and [[Hanali Celanil]]) formed when [[Lolth]] rebelled and was exiled.\n\n* Intermediate gods:\n** [[Aerdrie Faenya]], goddess of the wind, weather, [[avariel]] and [[aarakocra]].\n** [[Deep Sashelas]], god of the seas and of the [[aquatic elves]], leader of the ''[[Asathalfinare]]'' pantheon.\n** [[Erevan Ilesere]], god of trickery, mischief, and rogues.\n** [[Hanali Celanil]], goddess of romantic love, beauty, joy and [[celadrin]]s.\n** [[Labelas Enoreth]], deity of time, history, and knowledge.\n** [[Rillifane Rallathil]], god of nature, woodlands, and [[wild elves]] and/or [[wood elves]].\n** [[Sehanine Moonbow]], goddess of the moon, dreams, mysteries, secrets, travel/journeys; she is also the protector of the elven dead and patron of the [[moon elves]]. Often described as Corellon's consort.\n** [[Solonor Thelandira]], god of hunting, archery, and survival. He was also the guardian of the boundaries between civilization and the wilds.\n** [[Tarsellis Meunniduin]], god of mountains, rivers, wilderness and [[snow elf|snow elves]].{{Cite dragon/236/The Seldarine Revisited}}\n** [[Vandria Gilmadrith]], goddess of grief, justice, vigilance and war.<ref>\n\n* Lesser gods:\n** [[Araleth Letheranil]], god of starlight and twilight.\n** [[Hlal|Avachel]], the male elven manifestation of the draconic deity Hlal.\n** [[Fenmarel Mestarine]], god of outcasts, scapegoats, and isolation.\n** [[Khalreshaar]], an interloper demigoddess in the elven pantheon, aspect of [[Mielikki]].

        "Worship": "Each member of the Seldarine was represented by both male and female forms. For example, in Cormanthor, there were statues of the Seldarine in either both their male and female forms or in a single androgynous form. Some gods even had more than three forms, including nonhumanoid forms.\n\nIn fact, the elves found the [[human]] obsession with biological sex and gender roles to be limiting and not befitting of a deity, who was beyond mortal definitions. All gods were to be respected, not squeezed into a role that presented them as little more than powerful versions of mortals at best or spoiled children at worst.",
        "History": {
            "Myths & Lore": "{{Sectstub}}\nAmong their accomplishments as an organisation, the Seldarine are reputed to have driven the [[Giant pantheon|Ordning]] from their realm before settling there, only allowing [[Iallanis]] to remain because she did not fight back. Because of this, they did not hold much respect for her.",
            "War of the Seldarine": "In {{Yearlink|-30000}}, Araushnee, with the help of her son [[Vhaeraun]], gathered a host of evil deities opposed to the Seldarine, and convinced them to attack [[Arvandor]], in an attempt to overthrow [[Corellon]]. Ghaunadaur entered the fray on his own without being asked by anyone.\n\nShe had planned for the assault to ultimately fail, as her actual goal was for his consort to be killed during the battle and to replace him as [[Coronal]] of Arvandor. She tricked Eilistraee into dangerously injuring her own father, but the Weaver's conspiracy was ultimately thwarted by [[Sehanine Moonbow]], and Corellon's life was saved. Angharradh arose from the great battle between the Seldarine and the followers of [[Araushnee]]. Aerdrie, Hanali and Sehanine came together to heal [[Corellon Larethian]] after he was felled by [[Eilistraee]] who was fooled by Araushnee. As they did so, they formed Angharradh, serving alongside Corellon as the Queen of Arvandor.. After her betrayal was revealed, Araushnee was banished by Corellon and turned into a [[tanar'ri]], while Vhaeraun was simply exiled. Even though she was cleared from all guilt, Eilistraee chose to share her mother's and brother's punishment, because she knew that the drow would need her light in the times to come.\n\nThe [[wizard]] [[Mordenkainen]] recorded a different version of this story. According to him, all elves, including the ones who would become the deities of the Seldarine and of the Dark Seldarine, emerged from the blood that Corellon lost in a fight against [[Gruumsh]]. Like their god, the first elves had shape-changing powers, and freedom with them. The Protector took some favorites, who were made [[deity|deities]]: among them, Lolth was the most privileged. She saw that other races made something out of their lives, and made the argument that the elves should do the same by casting off their shape-changing powers in exchange of a fixed form, that would allow them to gain dominion over everything. Every single elf agreed and chose such a form, but Corellon was revolted by their decision and railed against Lolth. The god was stopped with the argument that nobody of his blood should be attacked, and, while he was thinking about it, Lolth used the opportunity to attempt to murder him. Realizing the extent of Lolth's betrayal, many elves intervened to stop her, but some remained loyal to the Spider Queen: the latter became the dark elves and their gods, and Lolth became a [[demon lord]] of the [[Abyss]]. Eilistraee was an exception in this version too, for she did not side with Lolth, but still chose to follow the dark elves.\nAraushnee took the name of Lolth, and made the 66th layer of the Abyss, the [[Demonweb Pits]], her new home.",
            "Modern History": "{{Sectstub}}\nThe events of the [[Spellplague]] affected the Seldarine, though perhaps not as harshly as it did some of the other deities. However, several of the gods, such as Deep Sashelas, Labelas, Solonor, Erevan, Fenmarel, and Shevarash all became exarchs. Corellon and Angharradh managed to hang on to their original positions, but Hanali became the elven aspect of Sune, and Sehanine of Selune.\n\nAfter the Second Sundering, order was restored, and the Seldarine was back to the way it was prior to the Spellplague, with Sehanine being described as Corellon's main consort/beloved."
