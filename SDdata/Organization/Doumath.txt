The '''Doumath''' mercantile house of [[Ravens Bluff]], previously known as '''House Bentbow''', was a group of [[half-elves|half]]-[[elf|elven]] merchants that lived within the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Doumath's trade involved the procurement of exotic [[:category:trees|woods]], inlay carvings and the crafting, selling, repairing and refinishing of wooden furniture. They did few refurbishments, and saved those for highly-prized antiques, or actual works of art.

The logo of House Doumath, a drawn [[bow]], with [[owl]] wings replacing the [[bowstring]], was carved on inconspicuous locations on all the furniture they produced.

==History==
Following the death of [[Emryn Bentbow]], his business and assets were purchased by the ambitious wood-carver [[Ildryn Doumath]]. In addition to the Bentbow holdings, the young Doumath also inherited Emryn's seat on the [[Merchants Council]], as well as the house's sterling reputation.
