The Doumath mercantile house of Ravens Bluff, previously known as House Bentbow, was a group of half-elven merchants that lived within the city of Ravens Bluff during the late 14 century DR.
Doumaths trade involved the procurement of exotic woods, inlay carvings and the crafting, selling, repairing and refinishing of wooden furniture. They did few refurbishments, and saved those for highly-prized antiques, or actual works of art.
The logo of House Doumath, a drawn bow, with owl wings replacing the bowstring, was carved on inconspicuous locations on all the furniture they produced.
Following the death of Emryn Bentbow, his business and assets were purchased by the ambitious wood-carver Ildryn Doumath. In addition to the Bentbow holdings, the young Doumath also inherited Emryns seat on the Merchants Council, as well as the houses sterling reputation.
