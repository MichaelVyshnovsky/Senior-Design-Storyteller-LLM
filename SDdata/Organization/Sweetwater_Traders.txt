The '''Sweetwater Traders''', or simply '''Sweetwater''', were a shipping and transport company operating in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The company was owned by [[Mathias Rylin]]. They were named for the minty-sweet waters of the [[Delimbiyr River]].

==Activities==
Sweetwater focused its efforts on transporting goods and produce along the Delimbiyr Vale, between the four major settlements of [[Daggerford]], [[Secomber]], [[Loudwater]], and [[Llorkh]], with occasional forays to [[Waterdeep]]. While dealing in Llorkh meant dealing with the [[Zhentarim]], they were not known to ever carry contraband, [[drug]]s, [[poison]]s, or [[slavery|slaves]]. They had a reputation for reliability.

==Symbol==
Their symbol was a waterfall in profile—most likely the [[Shining Falls]]—from which four motes of light rose. This was ringed by a circle formed from the names of their principle stops: Daggerford, Secomber, Loudwater, and Llorkh. These symbols were displayed in gold paint on the sides of the wagons in their caravans.
