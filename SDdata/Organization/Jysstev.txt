House Jysstev was an Amnian house. 
The house backed the Jhannivvar pretender for the throne of Tethyr and subsequently lost its riches, living in near poverty. It was forced to sell its assets in Athkatla and Murann, and move to Eshpurta. The house remained well ranked, but only through debts of honour.
* Qar Jysstev, Namarch on the Council of Six and lord of the house.
