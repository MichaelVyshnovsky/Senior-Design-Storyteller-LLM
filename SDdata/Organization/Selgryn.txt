The '''Selgryn''' were a tribe of [[kobold]]s inhabiting the area surrounding the [[Ice Lakes]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were notable for their use of traps to fend off foes.

==Tactics==
The tribe used [[caltrop]]s, [[pit trap]]s, and [[spring-spear]]s in defense of their territory.

==Base of Operations==
The Selgryn operated out of the Ice Lakes area, northeast of [[Luskan]].

==Possessions==
Chieftain [[Ulag Selgryn]] had magical items in his possession.

==Relationships==
[[Luskan]] sent out patrols into the territory of the Selgryn, which the tribe fended off using traps.

==History==
The Selgryn nearly wiped out the local [[Uthgardt]]<ref group="note" name="black raven" /> that roamed the Ice Lakes area, at the cost of heavy losses of their own.
