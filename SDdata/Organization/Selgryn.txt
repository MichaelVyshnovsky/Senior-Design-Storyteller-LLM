The Selgryn were a tribe of kobolds inhabiting the area surrounding the Ice Lakes in the midâ€“14 century DR. They were notable for their use of traps to fend off foes.
The tribe used caltrops, pit traps, and spring-spears in defense of their territory.
The Selgryn operated out of the Ice Lakes area, northeast of Luskan.
Chieftain Ulag Selgryn had magical items in his possession.
Luskan sent out patrols into the territory of the Selgryn, which the tribe fended off using traps.
The Selgryn nearly wiped out the local Uthgardt that roamed the Ice Lakes area, at the cost of heavy losses of their own.
