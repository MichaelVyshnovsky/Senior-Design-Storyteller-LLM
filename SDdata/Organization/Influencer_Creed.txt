The Influencer Creed was one of the major illithid Creeds in the Realms. They believed that the best way to obtain knowledge was through indirect means. The Influencers wished to transform the societies of other races by removing important sources of lore . They were well known in illithid hives to be behind the mysterious death of a sage or the secret plundering of a library.
The Influencers had a base called the Pillars of Thought in Oryndoll. In the city, they influenced a part of the military called the Lore Filchers.
