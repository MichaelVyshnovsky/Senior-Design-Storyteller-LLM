The '''Influencer Creed''' was one of the major [[illithid]] [[Creed (illithid)|Creeds]] in the Realms. They believed that the best way to obtain knowledge was through indirect means. The Influencers wished to transform the societies of other races by removing important sources of lore . They were well known in [[illithid]] hives to be behind the mysterious death of a sage or the secret plundering of a library.<ref name ="DDGttUpp22,79,81">
