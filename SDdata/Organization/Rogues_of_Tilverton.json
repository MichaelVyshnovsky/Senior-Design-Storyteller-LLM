        "mainbody": "he Rogues of Tilverton, who were also simply called the Rogues, was the only thieves guild found in the city of Tilverton in the .\nThere were roughly 70 Rogues as of 1358 DR. They operated in the sewers beneath the city, as well as Grimwalds Revenge which provided secret access to the sewers. Some of the local merchants aided the Rogues in order to prevent thefts in their shops, and Gahlaerd Mossmere kept a safehouse for them and provide magical services.\nThey kept on a low-level conflict with the Fire Knives in the city, trying to drive out the far more murderous organization. They wished to keep the status quo in Tilverton and Cormyr at large, and had no desire to upend things by allowing King Azoun Obarskyr IV or other important personages to be killed.\nThe Rogues base was an expansive underground complex hidden under Tilverton, connected to the sewers and other locations by tunnels. Within, they had storerooms, barracks, training facilities, a shrine of Mask, and a treasury, as well as a luxurious audience hall, office, quarters and library for the Guildmaster.\nThe Rogues were led by Artur Grossmans father, who was slain by the Fire Knives after allowing them to take refuge in the city after they were purged from Cormyr in 1341 DR. Artur took control from that point through to 1367 DR, when he disappeared and was replaced by his daughter Lharae Grossman.\nIn Arturs time, the guild had a great many members, including but not limited to\n* Guildmaster Artur \"the Fat Man\" Grossman\n* Lharae \"the Lithe\" Grossman\n* Fluffy and Bojangles, Arturs beloved dire wolf pets.\n* Cutthroat McGill, a skilled thief.\n* Thalia, a skilled thief.\n* Four trusted senior thieves who acted as sergeants for the rest.\n* 45 thieves of some skill.\n* Four heavily-equipped guards.\n* Six ogres who acted as door-guards and bruisers.\n* 20 servants who worked in the guilds hideout and waited on Artur."
