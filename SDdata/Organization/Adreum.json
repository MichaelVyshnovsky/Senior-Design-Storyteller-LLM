Lord Adreum VI was a part of the last generation of Adreums.\nThe Adreum familys history became tinted with stories and legends by the late 14 century DR. The town of Last Port was renamed sometime soon after the familys demise, becoming Port Llast. Locals believed the Adreum Curse would eventually fall upon the town, raising the dead and sending them onto the Ports streets. When the dead started showing up late at night on the streets of Last Port, some people believed it was the Adreums doing. To give that theory more creedance, one walking dead was heard chanting the towns old name â€“ \"Last Port.\""
