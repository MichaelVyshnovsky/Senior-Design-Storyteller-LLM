The Tribe of the Wolf was a nomadic group of Reghedman barbarians living in the tundra of Icewind Dale.
The Tribe of the Wolf took part in the Battle of Icewind Dale in the  under the leadership of Wolf King Beorg. The Wolf tribe suffered the most deaths out of any of the Reghedman tribes in the battle and soon lost much of its influence, becoming a minor tribe. With Beorg lacking any heir, the role of leadership fell to the tribes shaman Jütti Merliss.
In the late 15 century DR, with the tribe low on food during an early onset of winter Jütti called out to evil deities for salvation and had her pleas answered by Malar. He chose a warrior in her tribe by the name of Isarr Kronenstrom to have the opportunity of becoming his Chosen.
By the time of the War of the Silver Marches, the Tribe of the Wolf was severely weakened and had been leaderless for a few years. Although Chieftain Isarr Kronenstrom assumed the title of Wolf King for himself, other tribesmen did not recognize his authority.
Unlike the other Reghedmen tribes, the Tribe of the Wolf did not live peacefully with the people of the Ten Towns in the years following the war.
