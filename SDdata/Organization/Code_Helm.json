        "mainbody": "'''Code Helm''' was an organization based on the planet [[Glyth]] in the mid‒14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Code Helm was focused on destroying the [[mind flayer]]s. They funded their operation from loot gathered from mind flayer [[spelljammer]]s. While not technically a mercenary company, if offered money and a chance to slay illithids, Code Helm would likely take the offer.",
        "Base of Operations": "The company resided in an outpost within the third ring of Glyth, unless they were actively transporting rescued persons to their homes.",
        "Membership": "Members of Code Helm were brave men and women devotees of [[Helm]] who lived outside [[Toril]]. Many were [[cleric]]s of Helm, but most were actually [[paladin]]s of other gods dedicated to Code Helm's ideals. Helm granted both his own clerics and these paladins a special spell of ''[[mental prowess]]'' for joining Code Helm.\n\nIn the mid‒14{{th}} century DR, the leader of the group was [[Easel Gifford]] of [[Amn]], a paladin of [[Torm]]. The group was ruled under a strict, military-like hierarchy, originally by the priests of Helm, but since so many other religions (80%) were involved, this was changed."
