The members of the guild were allowed to set the highest fees for their service and custom orders of vaults and special locks placed by wealthy [[adventurer]]s and nobles. Another business exclusive to the members of the Splendid Order was the creation of fashion signet [[ring]]s for the nobles and the [[Lords of Waterdeep]], while guild stamps were made for the Waterdhavian guilds.\n\nThe guild's uniform consisted of a gray [[cloak]] held in place by a blue star broch on the left shoulder. Membership dues were two [[gold]] [[coin|pieces]] per month, and a one-time entrance fee to the Metal House of Wonders cost thirty-five [[gp]]. Each guild member trained a group of apprentices for many years at a time.",
