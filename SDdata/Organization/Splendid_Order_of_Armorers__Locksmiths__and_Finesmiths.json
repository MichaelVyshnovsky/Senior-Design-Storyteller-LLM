        "mainbody": "The Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, and Finesmiths was a guild in Waterdeep in the mid–14 century DR. It convened at the Metal House of Wonders.\nThe Splendid Orders membership was reserved only for the most skilled, talented, and renowned smiths of armor, shields, weapons, locks, metal sculptures, masks, wire-jewelry, metal plating for party costumes, decorative metal birds, and other items of \"finest quality\" sought after by mages who weaved magical enchantments into them. The members of the guild were allowed to set the highest fees for their service and custom orders of vaults and special locks placed by wealthy adventurers and nobles. Another business exclusive to the members of the Splendid Order was the creation of fashion signet rings for the nobles and the Lords of Waterdeep, while guild stamps were made for the Waterdhavian guilds.\nThe guilds uniform consisted of a gray cloak held in place by a blue star broch on the left shoulder. Membership dues were two gold pieces per month, and a one-time entrance fee to the Metal House of Wonders cost thirty-five gp. Each guild member trained a group of apprentices for many years at a time.\nThe Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, and Finesmiths operated out of the Metal House of Wonders located along Belnimbras Street and Gut Alley in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep. \nAround the 1370s DR, High Seeker Jhoadil Zulthind of the Church of Gond partnered with this and other guilds in the city to begin actively marketing constructs to the wealthiest residents of Waterdeep. During the same period of time, the scions of the noble Amcathra house were among active patrons of the Splendid Order.\n*Avi, a genasi expert armorsmith in the late 15 century DR. \n*Hallthor Duzmund, a fighter, Master Smith, and the guildmaster in the mid–14 century DR.\n*Roysark Cuthbarrel, the guildmaster in the late 15  century DR."
