The '''Sons of Light''' were a group of [[knight]]s led by [[Scottie Torilson]] in the early 8{{th}} century [[DR]]. They fought in the latter days of the [[Weeping War]]. The whole group died in the {{YearlinkName|713}} while defending a strategically unimportant [[Elf|elven]] village, because their duty demanded it.
