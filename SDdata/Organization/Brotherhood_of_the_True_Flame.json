        "Members": "Most members of this society were pure [[elemental mage|flame elementalists]]. Non-wizards also served within the society, but held much lower ranks compared to their elementalist brethren.\n\nThis society held the largest collection of wizards with the same goals and specializations within all of the Land of Fate. They had members hidden within every major city of Zakhara. Their strongest fortresses were rumored to be located somewhere deep within the Weeping Desert and the Great Anvil.",
        "Initiation": "The only wizards allowed into the ranks of the Brotherhood of the True Flame were fire elemental mages. Members from the brotherhood attempted to slay [[Sorcerer (kit)| flame sorcerers]] because they were not pure. The actual initiation process remained unknown, but was rumored to be gruesome as every last vestige of goodness in the initiate was \"burned out\" of their mind.",
        "Description": "This was a large organization, a fact that benefited and hindered them. Small factions broke off on a semi-regular basis and charismatic leaders arose.",
        "Goals": "Members of the Brotherhood of the True Flame aspired to assert the dominance of [[Flame (province)|flame magic]] over all other forms of magic in Zakhara. All other forms of magic were viewed as unpure and were to be eliminated. Anything or anyone that hindered this belief was destroyed.",
        "Relationships": "The Brotherhood was known to associate with select groups of [[holy slayer]]s on occasion. They also established a small embassy in the [[efreeti]] [[City of Brass]] on the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]].\n\nThe Prince of [[Kadarasto]], [[Nari ibn Aman]], allied himself with the Brotherhood, allowing them to form a small base within the catacombs of his city.{{cite book/Ruined Kingdoms/Campaign Guide|29}}",
        "Strongholds": "The Brotherhood's main stronghold was magically hidden from the eyes of men and [[genie]]s deep within the [[Great Anvil]]. Another impressive fortress controlled by the Brotherhood was [[Krak al-Niraan]] located within the [[Weeping Desert]]."
