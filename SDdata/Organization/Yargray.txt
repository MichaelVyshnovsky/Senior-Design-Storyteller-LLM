The '''Yargray''' tribe was one of the groups of [[frost giant]]s that dwelled within the mountain domain of [[Tholvarr]] in the [[Spine of the World]].

==History==
For many years the tribe was led by [[Orel|Jarl Orel "the Grayhand"]]. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] he had grown quite old. His daughter, [[Gerti Orelsdottr]] sought leadership of the tribe in his final years.
