        "mainbody": "The '''Church of Velsharoon''' was a collection of [[cleric]]s, [[necromancer]]s, and specialty priests called [[necrophant]]s devoted to [[Velsharoon]], the Archmage of [[Necromancy]].",
        "Organization": "About one fifth of Velsharoon's followers were previously followers of [[Myrkul]] who had no desire to worship [[Kelemvor]] or [[Cyric]] after the [[Time of Troubles]]. Acolytes and novices within the church were called pallbearers. Mid-ranking priests earned several titles including Soul Taker, Cryptguardian, Dead Walker, Bleeder, Life Leech, Spirit Sepulcher, Seeker of the Seven Tombs, and Necromaster. The highest of Velsharoon's clergy were given unique titles by the Archmage of Necromancy himself.{{cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Moonsea:Northkeep Portal}} and rarer worshipers such as the \"white\" necromancer, [[Aldym]] of [[Halruaa]].{{cite book/Champions of Valor|152}}\n\nThere was no greater organization amongst the temples by {{yearlink|1372}}, as the faith was still new; the structures were individual to every cult.{{cite web/Class Chronicles: Truenamers}} and sometimes, [[githyanki]].{{Cite polyhedron/159/Incursion: Knights of the Lich-Queen|28}} He was worshiped by some [[drow]] in [[Sshamath]].{{cite book/Drizzt Do'Urden's Guide to the Underdark|93}} His worship quickly expanded even into Halruaa,{{cite book/Races of Faerun|108}} where even some \"white\" necromancers worshiped him.{{cite book/Champions of Valor|152}} Finally, some of the [[Cairnheim]] giants had turned to his worship.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|211}}\n\nVelsharoon hoped the [[Order of the Long Death]] could be courted into his worship.{{cite web/Monks of the Long Death}}{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|25}}",
        "Activities": "Though Velsharoon was a largely unknown power in [[Faerûn]] as of [[1367 DR]], [[bard]]s begun relating tales of his rise to power which attracted followers.{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|222}}\n\nMost worshipers of Velsharoon spent the vast majority of their time in pursuit of necromantic research. [[Undead]] servitors were common and were released to wander the land when their purpose had been served.{{cite book/Monster Manual IV|22}} [[serpentir]]s{{cite book/Monster Manual V|161}} and even [[baneguard]]s.{{cite book/Monsters of Faerûn|17}}\n\nServants of Velsharoon were also known to have attempted to incapacitate, trap, or turn the [[Magister]] undead, an act which [[Mystra]] took quite personally.{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|5-6}}\n\nLower-ranking clerics often aided small communities with healing magic in order to collect funds for their research.",
        "Celebrations": "Though many holy days and rituals existed among the faithful of Velsharoon, the Church as a whole was not united into a cohesive unit to make them commonplace among the entirety of Velsharoon's followers. Instead, each sect tended to have their own unique celebrations.\n\nOne ritual which was widespread was the [[Pact of the Everlasting]] which involved ''[[Velsharoon's death pact]]'' being cast upon ranking clergy.{{cite book/Faiths and Pantheons|109-110}}",
        "Base of Operations": "Velsharoon's cultists gathered in crypts, mausoleums, and abandoned graveyards. The few temples dedicated to Velsharoon were found in ancient catacombs or necropolises.\n\nThe [[Crypt of the Arisen Army]] was a temple dedicated to Velsharoon found within the [[Forgotten Crypt]] in [[Skull Gorge]].",
        "Dogma": "Velsharoon's faithful viewed themselves as chosen apostles and visionaries who deserved the respect of commoners for their excursions into life and death. They believed that their true power existed in the obscure zone that lay between life and death. Knowledge was increased in the pursuit to extend the mortal condition of the physical form. They believed any sacrifices made during their dark pursuits were justified in the long run. Knowledge was power, and the knowledge of life and death granted power over all beings.",
        "Orders": "Many necromancers who followed Velsharoon formed small secretive sects.\n\nThe [[Order of One Thousand Nightmares]] was a group of [[Nightmare (creature)|nightmare]]-riding [[sword wraith]]s who had been subverted to serve as a necromantic knighthood for the church.\n\nThe church of [[Velsharoon]] was central to the [[Cult of the Dragon]] in the 1370s, as these wizards were rarely willing to even pay lip service to [[Mystra]].{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting|272}}{{cite book/Cult of the Dragon|29-30}} The forces of the Cult that accompanied [[Kya Mordrayn]] into [[Myth Drannor]] were bolstered by [[Ryngoth]] and his priests of Velsharoon.{{cite book/Pool of Radiance: Attack on Myth Drannor}} Other priests of Velsharoon in the cult included [[Arleanda]];{{cite book/Dragons of Faerun|58}} these priests were encountered by [[adventurer]]s throughout the {{yearlink|1373}}.{{cite book/The Rage|231}}{{cite book/Queen of the Depths||8, 11}}\n\nA [[Knight of the Weave]] could serve [[Velsharoon]].{{cite book/Champions of Valor|117}}"
