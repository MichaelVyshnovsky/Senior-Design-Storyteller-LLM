The Church of Velsharoon was a collection of clerics, necromancers, and specialty priests called necrophants devoted to Velsharoon, the Archmage of Necromancy. 
About one fifth of Velsharoons followers were previously followers of Myrkul who had no desire to worship Kelemvor or Cyric after the Time of Troubles. Acolytes and novices within the church were called pallbearers. Mid-ranking priests earned several titles including Soul Taker, Cryptguardian, Dead Walker, Bleeder, Life Leech, Spirit Sepulcher, Seeker of the Seven Tombs, and Necromaster. The highest of Velsharoons clergy were given unique titles by the Archmage of Necromancy himself. and rarer worshipers such as the "white" necromancer, Aldym of Halruaa.

He was worshiped by some drow in Sshamath. His worship quickly expanded even into Halruaa, where even some "white" necromancers worshiped him. Finally, some of the Cairnheim giants had turned to his worship.
Velsharoon hoped the Order of the Long Death could be courted into his worship.
Though Velsharoon was a largely unknown power in Faer√ªn as of 1367 DR, bards begun relating tales of his rise to power which attracted followers.
Most worshipers of Velsharoon spent the vast majority of their time in pursuit of necromantic research. Undead servitors were common and were released to wander the land when their purpose had been served. serpentirs and even baneguards.
Servants of Velsharoon were also known to have attempted to incapacitate, trap, or turn the Magister undead, an act which Mystra took quite personally.
Lower-ranking clerics often aided small communities with healing magic in order to collect funds for their research.
Though many holy days and rituals existed among the faithful of Velsharoon, the Church as a whole was not united into a cohesive unit to make them commonplace among the entirety of Velsharoons followers. Instead, each sect tended to have their own unique celebrations.
One ritual which was widespread was the Pact of the Everlasting which involved Velsharoons death pact being cast upon ranking clergy.
Velsharoons cultists gathered in crypts, mausoleums, and abandoned graveyards. The few temples dedicated to Velsharoon were found in ancient catacombs or necropolises.

Velsharoons faithful viewed themselves as chosen apostles and visionaries who deserved the respect of commoners for their excursions into life and death. They believed that their true power existed in the obscure zone that lay between life and death. Knowledge was increased in the pursuit to extend the mortal condition of the physical form. They believed any sacrifices made during their dark pursuits were justified in the long run. Knowledge was power, and the knowledge of life and death granted power over all beings.
Many necromancers who followed Velsharoon formed small secretive sects.
The Order of One Thousand Nightmares was a group of nightmare-riding sword wraiths who had been subverted to serve as a necromantic knighthood for the church.
The church of Velsharoon was central to the Cult of the Dragon in the 1370s, as these wizards were rarely willing to even pay lip service to Mystra. The forces of the Cult that accompanied Kya Mordrayn into Myth Drannor were bolstered by Ryngoth and his priests of Velsharoon.
