The '''Warders''' were the city watchmen of [[Thentia]].

==Activities==
The Warders were responsible for keeping the peace inside Thentia. They also directly protected the [[Watchlord's Tower]] with a garrison of 10 veteran members, and kept at least 20 Warders patrolling the city's docks at any time due to its constant and high levels of activity.

==Posessions==
The Warders were equipped with [[leather armor]] and [[club]]s or [[short sword]]s.
