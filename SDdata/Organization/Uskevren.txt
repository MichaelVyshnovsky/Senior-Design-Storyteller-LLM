The '''Uskevren''' (meaning "too bold to hide" in some forgotten tongue) were a noble family of [[Selgaunt]] in [[Sembia]] who lived primarily in [[Stormweather Towers]]. Their house badge was a gold horse-head-and-fouled-anchor. Their money originally stockpiled through piracy, the family was nearly destroyed in the 1330s [[DR]] by rival families who discovered their illicit means of money-making.

The only surviving family member, [[Thamalon Uskevren]], rebuilt the family fortune by buying and selling land, and then began sponsoring common folk. After this, the people of Selgaunt began to trust the Uskevren name again.

==Members==

* [[Thamalon Uskevren II|Thamalon "Tamlin" Uskevren II]], Thamalon's foppish first son

* [[Talbot Uskevren|Talbot "Tal" Uskevren]], Thamalon's son
* [[Thamalon Uskevren]], Aldimar's son
* [[Phaldinor Uskevren]], the founder of the Uskevren as a noble family
* [[Thoebellon Uskevren]], Phaldinor's wastrel first son
* [[Roel Uskevren]], Phaldinor's son
* [[Tivamon Uskevren]], Phaldinor's son

* [[Ilrilteska Uskevren]], Aldimar's wife
* [[Perivel Uskevren]], Aldimar's first son
* [[Liferna Hedare]], an adventuress known in certain circles as Shadow Wind, who married into waterdhavian nobility<ref>

==Enemies==
Primary among the Uskevren's enemies were those that helped nearly destroy them: the [[Soargyl]], [[Talendar]], [[Baerodreemer]], [[Ithivisk]], and [[Malveen]].

==Properties==
In addition to Stormweather Towers, the Uskevrens had a tallhouse near the [[Way of the Manticore]] and another on [[Lurvin Street]]. They also owned a smaller home outside of the city, named [[Storl Oak]].

==Magical Items ==
Throughout the years, when there was doubt if someone was truly an Uskevren, the family used a magical cup called the ''[[Quaff of the Uskevren]]''. Enchanted long ago by [[Helemgaularn of the Seven Lightnings]] to keep revelers from stealing his mead, its enchantments were later altered so that only one of the blood of the Uskevren could touch it bare-handed and not be instantly burned.
