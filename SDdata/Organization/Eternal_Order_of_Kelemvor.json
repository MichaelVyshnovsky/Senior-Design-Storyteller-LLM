        "mainbody": "The '''Eternal Order of Kelemvor''' were followers of [[Kelemvor]] who maintained the [[Neverdeath Graveyard]] in [[Neverwinter]].",
        "Activities": "Their duty was to maintain the sanctity of Neverdeath, a graveyard that was considered sacred to Kelemvor. In keeping with the tenants of the [[church of Kelemvor]], they taught that death was natural and not to be feared but that [[undead]] were unnatural and had to be destroyed. They saw themselves as servants of both the dead and the bereaved: they conducted funerals, ensured that the dead could rest in peace, provided counseling to those who lost loved ones, and destroyed undead.",
        "Relationships": "The Order was aligned with Neverwinter, including the [[New Neverwinter]] movement and the [[Neverwinter Guard]].",
        "History": "When the undead began to rise in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Eternal Order of Kelemvor's duty shifted to fighting the undead and the [[Thay]]an [[necromancer]]s raising them. By {{Yearlink|1479}}, they had lost control of the graveyard and had retreated to a small camp known as [[Doomguide's Watch]].",
        "Members": "The Eternal Order comprised [[Doomguide]]s and their [[acolyte]]s. As of 1479 DR, notable members included:\n* Doomguide [[Volahk]], the leader of the Eternal Order\n* Doomguide [[Awen]]\n* Doomguide [[Falstaff]]\n* Doomguide [[Ganilon]]\n* Doomguide [[Orran]]\n* Doomguide [[Severin]]\n* Doomguide [[Stonehammer]]\n* Doomguide [[Winlof]]\n* Acolyte [[Mina Neyman]]"
