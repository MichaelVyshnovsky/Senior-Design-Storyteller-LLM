The '''Moondarks''' were a [[half-elven]] family of sorcerers until the turn of the 7{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Base of Operations==
The family was mostly based in [[Westgate]] on the [[Dragon Coast]]. They had a family crypt there.

==Activities==
The family was known for dealing quite straight and squarely, and to challenge the rulers of Westgate too much for anyone's liking.

==Relationships==
One of their members, [[Eaergladden Moondark]], died destitute, though he was ultimately interred in the crypt.

==History==
The family died out around {{yearlink|600}}, about a hundred and sixty or so years prior to {{yearlink|767}}.
