        "mainbody": "he Cult of the Eyeless was a beholder cult active in Athkatla in around 1369 DR and in the city or Berdusk sometime before 1312 DR.\nOutwardly, its blind priests preached that all the gods were fakes, and that the only true one was the Unseeing Eye, whom the cult served. This helped it gain some followers among ordinary people who were disillusioned with the gods. In actual fact, the Unseeing Eye was a blind but immensely powerful beholder, who used the cult in its search for the second half of the Rift Device, an artifact of such great destructive power that the gods themselves had hidden it to prevent anyone from using it."
