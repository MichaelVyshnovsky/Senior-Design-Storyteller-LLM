        "mainbody": "The '''Order of the Triad''', also called the '''Triadic knights''', was a knightly order that served the kingdom of [[Old Impiltur]] for many years, from the 8{{th}} to the 12{{th}} century [[DR]]. These holy warriors had been gathered together from across [[Faerûn]] by the [[church of Torm|churches of Torm]], [[Church of Tyr|Tyr]], and [[Church of Ilmater|Ilmater]] and united in service of their gods and the nation in which they found a home. They gave rise to the [[Triadic knight]]s who populated various paladin orders of these churches in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": {
            "Legacy": "Yet its traditions and faith in the Triad survived in future generations, in the form of Triadic knights. A century into the new Heltharn Dynasty, in the [[1196 DR|Year of the Shrike, 1196 DR]], King [[Imphras II]] was inspired to found a new holy knightly order to serve the monarchy and revise the Order of the Triad's traditions and formed the [[Most Holy Order of the Sacred Shrike]]. This anti-[[demon]] knightly order would come to be known simply as the [[Knights of Imphras II]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]], its leading members were these Triadic knights. The order was originally restructured in [[1336 DR]] as the established oligarchical council [[Lords of Imphras II|Lords of Imphras II's]] military elite by [[Rilimbrar|King Rilimbrar]].\n\nMeanwhile, beyond Impiltur, in [[interior Faerûn|central]] and [[west Faerûn]], Triadic knights served in the countless knightly orders dedicated to Ilmater, Torm, and Tyr, or the Triad as a whole. They were present in large numbers as leading members of the [[Knights Kuldar]] at [[Barakmordin]] in [[Tethyr]] and of the [[Janessar]] in [[Calimshan]], both dedicated to the Triad. However, the majority, though not by much, were independent [[cleric]]s and paladins who venerated the Triad apart from the individual churches with little if any opposition from them."
