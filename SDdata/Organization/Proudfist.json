        "mainbody": "The '''Proudfists''' was a tribe of [[half-orc]]s that lived on the [[Sword Coast North]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Relationships": "As of the late 1470s DR, the Proudfists lived in bondage to the [[Many-Arrows]] kingdom of full-blooded [[orc]]s, but they suffered under their cruel and oppressive rule.",
        "Organization": "The leader of the tribe was a particularly strong half-orc named Hulgen. Despite his role as the tribes' leader, Hulgen was forced to report to an overseer of the Many-Arrows, and ultimately served [[Vansi Bloodscar]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the Proudfist tribe was among the orcish forces that occupied the ruined [[Neverwinter/River District|River District]] of [[Neverwinter]].\n\nDespite this, the Neverwintan mage [[Riftel Farsight]] felt they could be persuaded to side with Neverwinter over the Many-Arrows and wanted to begin a parlay with Hulgen. However, she felt her shyness dealing with them made her appear weak and distrusted, so she requested a [[half-elf]] adventurer to find and negotiate with them. But for them to gain the trust of the Proudfist tribe, they had to successfully pass a series of trials proving they had strength, guile, and wisdom and thus were worthy. Chalik, however, claimed to have already had a vision of the adventurer and believed they would guide the Proudfists on a journey that would bring them prosperity beyond what they ever thought possible. They reported their change of allegiance to Captain [[Janros]] of the [[Neverwinter Guard]]. Satisfied, Hulgen asked the adventurer to join them in battle as they rose up against their Many-Arrows overseer. After that, Hulgen would bring his tribe to Neverwinter's aid.",
