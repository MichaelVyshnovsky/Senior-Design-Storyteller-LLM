        "History": "As of the 4{{th}} century DR, before the duel between Khalitharius and [[Martek]], upon the [[efreet]]'s arrival in Raurin, the Malatath were first stationed in the Cursed City of Stone, [[Medinat Muskawoon]]. They used it as a base to terrorize people far and wide.\n\nWhen Martek's caravan came to confront Khalitharius, the Malatath slew one guard each night for three nights, never showing themselves.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|94}} When the caravan decided to form a ring around Martek's tent during the night, the Malatath instead slew their [[camel]]s during the night. The next morning, they destroyed half their water. Only then was Martek prepared to face the efreet in combat. But by the time Martek was victorious, the Malatath had slain all but one of his caravan. As a result of the battle between Martek and Khalitharius, magical fire covered what was left of Medinat Muskawoon and its surroundings for a score of years.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|95}}\n\nAs of {{yearlink|1356}}, the Malatath were stationed within the Hall of Kings in the [[Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak]],{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|81}} from where they could strike anywhere within {{SI|250|mile|k|long=yes}}.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|32}} Khalitharius led the Malatath against an army from the [[Airlancers]] of the [[Oasis of the White Palm]], who were looking for the culprit behind the destruction of the [[Oasis of Akhir]]. Though the efreet fought personally, he also brought forth his undead, who pour out against the Airlancers.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|31}} In his conversation with the adventurers who released the efreet, Sheik [[Kassim Arslan]] confided that forces had been sent north to fight against the efreet.{{cite book/Desert of Desolation|66}}"
