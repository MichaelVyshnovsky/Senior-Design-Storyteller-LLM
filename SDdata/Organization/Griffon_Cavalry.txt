The Griffon Cavalry was the air cavalry of the city of Waterdeep in the 13, 14, and 15 centuries DR. Part of the City Guard, it was a militia organization made up of soldiers, and griffons, responsible for defending and patrolling the great city.
The history of the Griffon Cavalry can perhaps be traced as far back as the second Trollwars (940 DR to 952 DR) when Ilithrew Belabranta rode his griffon into battle. One of his later heirs, Lord Palinor Belabranta, did the same versus the orc hordes of the Black Claw tribe in the . Since then, House Belabranta was a noble family associated with the breeding and training of griffons.
In the , Open Lord Ahghairon officially declared the Griffon Cavalry part of the City Guard during a huge orc siege on the city. The riders not only fought the orc hordes again, but were also used to shuttle in much needed supplies to the city.
The Griffon Cavalry later established a base of operations on the landward side of Mount Waterdeep called Peaktop Aerie, or Peaktop Eyrie. There they stabled over twenty griffons with another half-dozen housed at Castle Waterdeep.
As of 1479 DR, however, the Griffon Cavalry had been disbanded for years, as the griffons died in combat but were never replaced.
Then, in the , Open Lord Laeral Silverhand proposed refounding the Griffon Cavalry, and threatened to make Mirt do it. Either way, this goal was achieved by the , with the newly procured griffons continuing to be supplied by the Belabranta family.

A griffon cavalrymans uniform was similar to other guardsmans, with polished armor and a black tabard with gold trim, but the tabard was also emblazoned with griffon.
Griffon riders were also given either a ring of feather falling or a griffon badge of Waterdeep, which performed essentially the same function.
In addition to their other armament, the Griffon Cavalry often carried lances of burning blackfire into battle, wielding them to great effect atop their griffon steeds.
