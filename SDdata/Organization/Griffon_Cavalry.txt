The '''Griffon Cavalry''' was the air cavalry of the city of [[Waterdeep]] in the 13{{th}}, 14{{th}}, and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. Part of the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]], it was a militia organization made up of soldiers, and [[griffon]]s, responsible for defending and patrolling the great city.{{Cite comic/The Gathering}}

==History==
The history of the Griffon Cavalry can perhaps be traced as far back as the second [[Trollwars]] ([[940 DR]] to [[952 DR]]) when [[Ilithrew Belabranta]] rode his griffon into battle. One of his later heirs, Lord [[Palinor Belabranta]], did the same versus the orc hordes of the Black Claw tribe in the {{YearlinkName|1026}}. Since then, House [[Belabranta]] was a noble family associated with the breeding and training of griffons.

In the {{YearlinkName|1235}}, [[Lords of Waterdeep|Open Lord]] [[Ahghairon]] officially declared the Griffon Cavalry part of the City Guard during a huge orc siege on the city. The riders not only fought the orc hordes again, but were also used to shuttle in much needed supplies to the city.

The Griffon Cavalry later established a base of operations on the landward side of [[Mount Waterdeep]] called [[Peaktop Aerie]], or Peaktop Eyrie. There they stabled over twenty griffons with another half-dozen housed at [[Castle Waterdeep]].

As of [[1479 DR]], however, the Griffon Cavalry had been disbanded for years, as the griffons died in combat but were never replaced.

Then, in the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, Open Lord [[Laeral Silverhand]] proposed refounding the Griffon Cavalry, and threatened to make [[Mirt]] do it. Either way, this goal was achieved by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, with the newly procured griffons continuing to be supplied by the Belabranta family.

==Notable Griffon Riders and/or Trainers==

*[[Thurl Merosska]]: Left the Griffon Cavalry to later become leader of the [[Feathergale Knights]] by 1491 DR.
*[[Savra Belabranta]]: Member of the Feathergale Knights, but was freed from the cult's influence and joined the [[Order of the Gauntlet]] by [[1492 DR]].

==Equipment==
A griffon cavalryman's uniform was similar to other guardsman's, with polished armor and a black [[tabard]] with gold trim, but the tabard was also emblazoned with griffon.

Griffon riders were also given either a ''[[ring of feather falling]]'' or a [[griffon badge of Waterdeep]], which performed essentially the same function.

In addition to their other armament, the Griffon Cavalry often carried ''[[Lance of burning blackfire|lances of burning blackfire]]'' into battle, wielding them to great effect atop their griffon steeds.
