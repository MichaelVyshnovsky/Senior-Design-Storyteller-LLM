        "mainbody": "As a whole, the order was supported by both the Mystran and Selûnite faiths, though in greater part by the latter church.\nKnights of the Blue Moon were capable of attracting unique steeds that shared their outlook on morality in a similar manner as paladins of the Realms.\nSome folks of the realms saw the veneration of both Mystra and Selûne as something quite heretical.\nThe order was founded shorty after the Time of Troubles, in the . The Waterdhavian churches of Mystra and Selûne each believed that a united knightly order, representing each faith, was needed to combat the efforts of Shar and her evil schemes. Shortly thereafter both the House of the Moon and the Mystran House of Wonder each received a visit from a mysterious aasimar. \nThis individual was Xale, an extraplanar traveler who ventured from his home of Selûnarra on the Gates of the Moon after receiving visions of the moon Selûne, surrounded by the seven stars of Mystra. He answered the call to lead this new order of knights in service to the two goddesses to which he was devoted.\nIn their early years, they were hardly known beyond the city of Waterdeep, generally regarded with wariness and suspicion.\nIn order to join the order, an individual was required to live up to the tenets of the Mystran and Selûneite faiths, as well as take an oath to either one of the goddesses. Additionally they were asked to possess some affinity with lunar magic.\nIndividuals with sorcerous skill were favored due to the matter with which the Knights cast their spells, though bards and even paladins were also found among their numbers.\n* Xale of the Starry Glen, High Moonknight and leader of the order."
