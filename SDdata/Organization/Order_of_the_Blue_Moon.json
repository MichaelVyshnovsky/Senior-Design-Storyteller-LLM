        "mainbody": "As a whole, the order was supported by both the Mystran and Selûnite faiths, though in greater part by the latter church.\n\nKnights of the Blue Moon were capable of attracting unique steeds that shared their [[alignment|outlook on morality]] in a similar manner as [[paladin]]s of the Realms.\n\nSome folks of the realms saw the veneration of both Mystra and Selûne as something quite heretical.",
        "Activities": "Due to the small numbers within their order, knights of the blue moon often hired [[adventurer]]s to aid them in their missions against the agents of Shar. On occasion they would accompany adventuring bands, if their goals coincided with their own.",
        "Abilities": "Knights of the Blue Moon draw upon the influence that the moon had over the [[Weave]], their offensive and defensive skills changed in response to the waxing and waning of Selûne. The Knights of the Blue Moon called upon both [[magic|arcane]] and [[divine magic|divine]] magic in their service. \n\nDepending on the [[Lunar calendar|phase of the moon]], knights of the Blue Moon would receive divine boons from Selûne. On the days and nights around a new moon they were warded against harmful magic. On those around a full moon the power of their spellcasting could be bolstered.\n\nNovice knights were granted improved sight in the form of [[Low-light vision|lunar vision]] in order to combat the forces of darkness. Over time their vision was blessed by magic, a boon known as ''[[arcane sight|weavesight]]''.\n\nBy drawing upon the power of the moon, Knights of the Blue Moon could distinctly ''[[faerie fire| mark their foes]]'' in battle, bolster their [[:Category:light spells|lunar magic]], and even ''[[brilliant energy|imbue their weapons]]'' with Selûne's silver light.",
        "Tactics": "In combat, knights of the Blue Moon exercised great judiciousness. They carefully chose when and how to engage the forces of Shar, preferring harrying attacks that allowed for rapid retreats and redeployment.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Order of the Blue Moon only met together at the [[Hall of Reflected Moonlight]] on the nights of the full moon. At these meetings they discussed their collective aims and planned out operations to best carry them out.\n\nDuring the rest of the days of each month, the knights carried out their daily operations from the [[House of the Moon]], the [[Selûne]]ite temple in [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Possessions": "While the order had no preferred weapons or armor for its knights to wield, they often utilized the preferred weapons of their goddesses, the [[heavy mace]] for Selûne and the \"[[Shuriken|whirlstar]]\" for [[Mystra]].",

        "History": "The order was founded shorty after the [[Time of Troubles]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. The Waterdhavian churches of Mystra and Selûne each believed that a united knightly order, representing each faith, was needed to combat the efforts of Shar and her evil schemes. Shortly thereafter both the House of the Moon and the Mystran [[House of Wonder]] each received a visit from a mysterious [[aasimar]]. \n\nThis individual was [[Xale]], an extraplanar traveler who ventured from his home of [[Selûnarra]] on the [[Gates of the Moon]] after receiving visions of the moon Selûne, surrounded by the seven stars of Mystra. He answered the call to lead this new order of knights in service to the two goddesses to which he was devoted.\n\nIn their early years, they were hardly known beyond the city of Waterdeep, generally regarded with wariness and suspicion.",
        "Members": "In order to join the order, an individual was required to live up to the tenets of the [[Church of Mystra|Mystran]] and [[Church of Selûne|Selûneite faiths]], as well as take an oath to either one of the goddesses. Additionally they were asked to possess some affinity with [[lunar magic]].\n\nIndividuals with [[sorcerer|sorcerous]] skill were favored due to the matter with which the Knights cast their spells, though [[bard]]s and even paladins were also found among their numbers.",
        "Notable Knights of the Blue Moon": "* [[Xale|Xale of the Starry Glen]], High Moonknight and leader of the order."
