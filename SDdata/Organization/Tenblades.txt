The Tenblades was a small group of adventures active in Vaasa before much of the region had been explored or settled.
The Tenblades used their own wealth to fund the construction of the fortress of Darmshall. Darmshalls construction was prompted by the leader of the Tenblades, Romas Thunderclap, after two of their members were murdered. Romas figured the presence of the fortress would deter future attacks in the region. Darmshalls defenses were well-constructed, as even Zhengyi could not conquer the keep.
