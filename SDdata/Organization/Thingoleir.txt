The Thingoleirs were a family of spellcasters who lived in the Sembian city of Yhaunn during the 14 century DR.
The family came from the union of Strasus Thingoleir and Dagnalla Irongard, two powerful mages that fell in love while adventuring. They built their family home in Yhaunn, naming it Twostaves House from their own two spellcasting implements, and had three children together. They eventually came to name it Fourstaves House for the spellcasting abilities of Malia and Roderio, while Keph never developed magical powers.
Krin Foxrun joined the family by marrying Malia, and they had a magically gifted child of their own, Adrey.
