The '''Thingoleirs''' were a family of spellcasters who lived in the [[Sembia]]n city of [[Yhaunn]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The family came from the union of [[Strasus Thingoleir]] and [[Dagnalla Irongard]], two powerful [[mage]]s that fell in love while [[adventuring]]. They built their family home in Yhaunn, naming it Twostaves House from their own two spellcasting implements, and had three children together. They eventually came to name it [[Fourstaves House]] for the spellcasting abilities of [[Malia Thingoleir|Malia]] and [[Roderio Thingoleir|Roderio]], while [[Keph Thingoleir|Keph]] never developed magical powers.

[[Krin Foxrun]] joined the family by marrying Malia, and they had a magically gifted child of their own, [[Adrey Foxrun|Adrey]].
