The '''Cult of the Eternal Flame''' was a cult devoted to [[Imix]] and one of the four cults responsible for the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Activities==
The followers of the Eternal Flame cult were fascinated by the destructive power of fire in all its manifestations. They aspired to use the power of fire to eradicate the "corruption" of both civilization and nature using volcanic eruptions, forest fires, heat waves, and droughts, in order to herald a new world of ash and cinders ruled by fire alone. In the fire cultists' doctrine, the world and all its peoples were wicked and malformed, and the only hope was to purify everything, reducing all to smoking cinders.

==Recruitment==
The Eternal Flame recruited from among those drawn to destruction for its own sake. This philosophy was very popular among creatures of [[elemental fire]] and even non-intelligent fire monsters served the fire cultists.

While seeking new members, the cult would sometimes masquerade as the ''Circle of the Scarlet Moon'', a [[druid circle]] trying to restore nature's balance in the [[Dessarin Valley]].

==Tactics and philosophy==
The fire cultists' main personality traits were impetuousness, hotheadedness, and violence. However, they did not act like mindless savages; they used a touch of fiendish inventiveness in their impetuousness. In their forges managed by captured slaves, they created new instruments to advance their crazy philosophy. Fire cultists considered it a necessary step in their plan to unleash chaos over the world, to conquer, and to enslave.

==History==
The modern fire cult began when [[Vanifer]] recovered one of the four elemental weapons crafted centuries before by the [[drow]] [[archmage]] and [[Elder Elemental Eye]] cultist [[Vizeran DeVir]].

All their work culminated in [[1491 DR]] at in the [[Fane of the Eye]], under the ruined [[dwarf|dwarven]] city of [[Tyar-Besil]]. Working simultaneously with the other three elemental cults, the fire cultists tried to summon Imix to [[Toril]] using members of a missing diplomatic delegation from [[Mirabar]] and other captives as sacrifices.
