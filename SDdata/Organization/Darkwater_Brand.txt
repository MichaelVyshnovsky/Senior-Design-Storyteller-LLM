The '''Darkwater Brand''' was a merchant coster headquartered in [[Archenbridge]], run by Clan [[Dakker]] and their patriarch [[Vzoun Dakker]]. They also had operations in [[Ordulin]] and [[Hillsfar]].

==Activities==
At first glance, traders from the Darkwater exported produce and ore from [[Archendale]] and imported finished metalworking products from [[Glister]], [[Thentia]], and [[Melvaunt]] in the [[Moonsea]]. These business practices were just a cover for a slaving ring operated by Vzoun. While he was careful not to break the laws while in Archendale, Vzoun specialized in the kidnapping of children of wealthy [[Sembia]]n merchant families.

==Base of Operations==
The headquarter of the organization was [[Darkwater Brand (Archenbridge)|a shop in Archenbridge]], while it also maintained outposts in [[Hillsfar]] and [[Ordulin]].
