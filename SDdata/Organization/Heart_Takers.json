        "mainbody": "The Heart Takers were a tribe of orcs that dwelled within the Rauvin Mountains during the 14 century DR.\nThe Heart Takers earned their name from the ceremonial sacrifices they made in the name of the orc deity Gruumsh. They regularly cut out, cooked, and ate the hearts of animals and foes.\nThe tribe dwelled within the eastern peaks of the Rauvins, somewhat nearest to the Tornskulls.\nThe tribe considered the nearby Red Fangs tribe to be their rivals. Conversely, they truly feared the Tornskull orcs, due to their great numbers and ferocity in battle.\nDead Orc Pass was so named for a great battle that took place between the Heart Takers and Tornskulls tribes."
