The '''Giants in Grey''', or '''Chu Jen Yin''', were a group of legendary creatures of [[Shou Lung]].<ref group="note">In the sources, the name is spelled as both "Gray" and "Grey". This article adopts the spelling "Grey", which is used most recently and consistently in ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]''.

==Description==
The Giants were said to be of great height, standing {{SI|13|ft|long=yes}} high or taller, but humanoid in form. They wore flowing leather [[robe]]s typical of a [[sohei]], and these concealed their appearance. Most distinctively they were entirely gray in both dress and body.<ref name=tGHotR-p43/> They were also surrounded by a thick fog.<ref name=tGHotR-p43/>

==Legend==
A visitation of the Giants in Grey was said to presage the occurrence of an immense tragedy.

Within the [[Faith of the Nine Travelers]], appearances of the Giants in Grey were claimed to be miracles worked by the [[Nine Immortals]]. A small sect of the faith even worshiped the Giants in Grey themselves, such as at the [[Temple of the Nine Travelers]] in [[Manass]] in [[Khazari]].

Gray-clad giants figured in [[Wei Tsao Te]]'s ''[[Shichi Hsi]]'', a collection of history, legend, and official history, amidst other fantastical matters.

==History==
The Giants in Grey were first sighted in Shou Lung in [[-547 DR|Shou Year 703 (−547 DR)]]. A huge earthquake destroyed the province shortly afterwards.<ref name=tGHotR-p43>

In [[-392 DR|Shou Year 858 (−392 DR)]], the Giants in Grey appeared in the then Imperial Capital, [[Hai Sheng]], in the Imperial Compound itself. The following year, [[-391 DR|Shou Year 859 (−391 DR)]], saw the outbreak of the [[Ivory Plague]]. The disease decimated the population of the city and even killed the first [[Emperor Chin]] of the [[Hai Dynasty]] and most of his household and family.<ref name=tGHotR-p46> 

Sightings of the Giants in Grey were made across the empire in [[-270 DR|Shou Year 980 (−270 DR)]], before blight struck the coastal lowlands, causing crops to fail.<ref name=tGHotR-p51>

In [[251 DR|Wa Year 669 (251 DR)]], the Giants were also seen at least once in the nation of [[Wa]], during the final battle between shogun [[Nitta Shogoro]] and the Shou Lung forces when the Hidden Shogun drove them from Wa at last and freed his island. Shogoro proclaimed the Giants' presence as a sign of the doom of the Shou Lung Emperor.

The Giants in Grey also heralded the birth of the twin sons of the thirteenth Emperor Chin of the La Dynasty, [[Shin Lu]] and [[Shin Ginsen]], in [[1044 DR|Shou Year 2294 (1044 DR)]]. They would go on to split the empire into Shou Lung and [[T'u Lung]].<ref name=tGHotR-p51/>

The Giants in Grey had not been witnessed for several generations by [[1357 DR|Shou Year 2607 (1357 DR)]].
