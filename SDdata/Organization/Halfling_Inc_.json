Their signature prank was giving a gem-bag full of rocks to humans. They supported the idea of halflings as dangerously clever individuals, but they were also capable of heroism when no other option was possible.\nBefore 1357 DR, Halfling Inc. had removed the beholderÂ Xall from the Haunted Halls of Eveningstar and destroyed a gate to the Lower planes in Westgate.\nIn addition to the five core members listed below, other halflings often joined for a mission or a series of adventures. The group was also known to use humans and other races as agents, or temporarily join larger adventuring companies.\n* Allyia Columbine\n* Corkitron Allinamuck\n* Gormogord Fleminstar\n* Ortegar Mistfiffle\n* Ozyman Listfitter"
