        "mainbody": "The '''''asathalfinare''''' was a multi-species pantheon worshiped by good-aligned aquatic races. It was led by the [[Seldarine|elven god]] [[Deep Sashelas]], who made considerable efforts to maintain its unity.\n\nIts name was a contraction of a much longer [[Elven language|Elven]] phrase meaning \"those who have their being in the sea haunted by the true dream\". They worked to minimize conflict between their respective peoples.",
        "Members": "Members of the ''asathalfinare'' shared in common that the vast majority of their worshipers were water-breathing species living beneath water and that the protection of those waters was paramount in all of their thoughts.\n\nThey included:\n* [[Deep Sashelas]], creator of the [[sea elves]] and leader of the ''asathalfinare'' pantheon.\n* [[Eadro]], creator of the [[locathah]] and [[merfolk]].\n* [[Persana]], god of [[triton]]s.\n* [[Trishina]], mother of the [[shalarin]], goddess of the [[dolphin]]s and consort of Deep Sashelas.\n* [[Surminare]], goddess of the [[selkie]]s.\n* [[Water Lion]], an enigmatic god half-lion, half-fish.\n* [[Syranita]], patron deity of the [[aarakocra]]. and partly because she sought amity for her relatively weak race.",
        "Relations": "[[Stronmaus]] is well-disposed toward the gods of the ''asathalfinare'', and might send avatars to help them in times of need.\n\nThey shared a common enmity for [[Sekolah]], the [[sahuagin]] god and for [[Umberlee]]/[[Panzuriel]]."
