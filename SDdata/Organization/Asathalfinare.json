        "mainbody": "The asathalfinare was a multi-species pantheon worshiped by good-aligned aquatic races. It was led by the elven god Deep Sashelas, who made considerable efforts to maintain its unity.\nIts name was a contraction of a much longer Elven phrase meaning \"those who have their being in the sea haunted by the true dream\". They worked to minimize conflict between their respective peoples.\nMembers of the asathalfinare shared in common that the vast majority of their worshipers were water-breathing species living beneath water and that the protection of those waters was paramount in all of their thoughts.\nThey included\n* Deep Sashelas, creator of the sea elves and leader of the asathalfinare pantheon.\n* Eadro, creator of the locathah and merfolk.\n* Persana, god of tritons.\n* Trishina, mother of the shalarin, goddess of the dolphins and consort of Deep Sashelas.\n* Surminare, goddess of the selkies.\n* Water Lion, an enigmatic god half-lion, half-fish.\n* Syranita, patron deity of the aarakocra. and partly because she sought amity for her relatively weak race.\nStronmaus is well-disposed toward the gods of the asathalfinare, and might send avatars to help them in times of need.\nThey shared a common enmity for Sekolah, the sahuagin god and for Umberlee/Panzuriel."
