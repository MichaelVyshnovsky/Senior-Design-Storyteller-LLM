The clanmates fought alongside one another to slay the monstrous dragon, and decorated the entrance to their home with its remains.\n* Aruk Thundercaller, a warrior that nursed the aarakocra Sikki-kree back to health after she fell to the ground during a blizzard.\n* Demelok Nightwalker, an elderly clansman that helped goliath youths prepare for their trial of adulthood.\n* Suuk One-Feather, a skilled but solitary hunter that traveled far and wide across the Spine of the World.\n* Wayani Highhunter, the clans weaponsmith."
