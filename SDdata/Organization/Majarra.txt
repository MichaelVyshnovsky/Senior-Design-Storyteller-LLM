The noble house of '''Majarra''' ({{Pronounce|mah|JAR|ra|refs=}}) was a member of the [[nobility of Waterdeep]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were primarily interested in making [[musical instruments]], [[harp]]ing, and teaching others to play the harp. They also had a [[silver]] mining business in [[Mirabar]].

==Organization==
The official patriarch of the family was Lord [[Kelthul Majarra]] and his consort was Lady [[Regan Majarra|Regan]]. However, by the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, he had passed the management of the family businesses to his two eldest sons, [[Axor Majarra|Axor]] and [[Kehlann Majarra|Kehlann]], while Lord Kelthul served as the full-time president of [[New Olamn]] bardic college. Axor, his consort [[Larin Majarra|Larin]], and their two young children lived in Mirabar where he oversaw the family's silver mining operations. Kehlann resided in Waterdeep and took care of the instrument-making enterprise and any other business that did not fall under the purview of Kelthul at New Olamn. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, there were seventeen noble members of the family.

==Activities==
The Majarra family were strong financial supporters of the [[Church of Oghma]] and New Olamn. Several members of the family were on the faculty of the bardic college. Their silver mining business directly fed their instrument-making efforts and their wares, including [[flute]]s, [[longhorn]]s, and [[bell]]s were known throughout [[northeast Faerûn]]. In particular, their silver-belled [[tocken]] gained favor in the region and there was a time in the 1370s when one could hear daily tocken concerts when traversing the [[Mount Melody Walk]] to or from New Olamn.{{Cite dragon/335/New Olamn Bard College|26}}

==Base of Operations==
[[File:North Ward-Kormallis Villa.png|thumb|right|270px|''The Majarra family compound (labeled <code>N31</code>) ''circa'' 1372 DR.'']]
The family villa was a walled compound of three- and four-story buildings surrounding a small green space located on the southeast corner of [[Sulmor Street]] and [[Ussilbran Street]] in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]]. [[Axor Majarra]] maintained a residence in the mining city of Mirabar beginning in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}.

==Possessions==
In addition to their silver mines around Mirabar, an instrument-making shop, and the family villa, the Majrras owned some minor land holdings around the [[Ice Lakes]].{{Cite dragon/335/New Olamn Bard College|27}}

==Relationships==
Lord Kelthul was a strong supporter of [[Danilo Thann]] and the reformation of a bardic college in Waterdeep. The Majarra clan were significant donors to the Church of Oghma and the New Olamn bardic college.

==History==
The members of this house were the descendants of the [[Harpshield]]s that were ennobled as part of the kingdom of [[Delimbiyran]] in the {{YearlinkName|659}}. After the collapse of that realm, the Harpshields declared themselves rulers over what became known as the [[Harpshield Lands]] (located around the southeastern border of [[Ardeep Forest]]) in the {{YearlinkName|697}}.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|5}} This small kingdom survived for two-and-a-half centuries until the [[drow]] raids in the {{YearlinkName|942}}.  The survivors fled to [[Nimoar's Hold]] and joined Warlord [[Gharl]] in building what became Waterdeep, eventually taking the name Majarra and ascending to the nobility in the {{YearlinkName|1248}}. Over the centuries, their royal heritage was mostly forgotten.

In 1360 DR, Axor Majarra took over the managing of the family's silver mining operations in Mirabar. Sometime between the {{YearlinkName|1364}} and 1366, Lord Kelthul turned over the operations of the family businesses to his two eldest sons. In 1366 DR, New Olamn was rededicated and Lord Kelthul soon became its president.
