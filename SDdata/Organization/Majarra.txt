The noble house of Majarra () was a member of the nobility of Waterdeep in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. They were primarily interested in making musical instruments, harping, and teaching others to play the harp. They also had a silver mining business in Mirabar.

The Majarra family were strong financial supporters of the Church of Oghma and New Olamn. Several members of the family were on the faculty of the bardic college. Their silver mining business directly fed their instrument-making efforts and their wares, including flutes, longhorns, and bells were known throughout northeast Faerûn. In particular, their silver-belled tocken gained favor in the region and there was a time in the 1370s when one could hear daily tocken concerts when traversing the Mount Melody Walk to or from New Olamn.
