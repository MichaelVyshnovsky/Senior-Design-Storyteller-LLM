The House of Mawli was an unenlightened tribe inhabiting the Haunted Lands of Zakhara in the 1367 DR.
This tribe was primarily involved in raiding weaker tribes or anyone foolish enough to enter the Haunted Lands without a proper escort. They sold captured individuals into slavery as well.
Roughly thirty raiders and desert thieves comprised any wandering band from the House of Mawli. Jaffer al-Mawli, the son of the clan leader Rashid al-Mawli, usually led these mobile expeditions.
It remained unknown exactly how many raiders comprised this organization. Each sect within the House of Mawli had anywhere between 200 and 500 individuals.
