The '''House of Mawli''' was an [[Enlightenment|unenlightened]] tribe inhabiting the [[Haunted Lands]] of [[Zakhara]] in the [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
This tribe was primarily involved in raiding weaker tribes or anyone foolish enough to enter the Haunted Lands without a proper escort. They sold captured individuals into slavery as well.

==Members==
Roughly thirty raiders and desert thieves comprised any wandering band from the House of Mawli. [[Jaffer al-Mawli]], the son of the clan leader [[Rashid al-Mawli]], usually led these mobile expeditions.

It remained unknown exactly how many raiders comprised this organization. Each sect within the House of Mawli had anywhere between 200 and 500 individuals.
