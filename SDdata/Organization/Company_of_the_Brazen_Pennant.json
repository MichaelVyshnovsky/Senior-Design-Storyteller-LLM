        "mainbody": "The Company of the Brazen Pennant was a major ferrying service for towns and cities across northwest Faer√ªn.\nThe company offered transport via ship to major towns with a port, such as Luskan, across the Savage Frontier and Sword Coast North, and even locations in the Trackless Sea, such as Orlumbor and Mintarn. They were prompt with timing, and always left in the mid-morning within a one-hour time slot.\nCirca 1358 DR, they appeared to be the only company willing to take dangerous and risky trips, such as to Tuern and Gundarlun. However, such trips came at a cost of 100 gp per head, and disasters were known to happen. The Heroes of Ascore used their service to sail to Gundarlun and rescue Jagaerda."
