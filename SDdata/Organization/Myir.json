        "mainbody": "The '''Myir''' were a tribe of people living in the town of [[Nathoud]] between [[Rashemen]] and the [[Hordelands]].",
        "Activities": "Famed for their prized [[Nathoudi stallion]]s, the Myir were not known for anything other than horse-breeding.",
        "History": "Originally part of the [[Nar]] nation, the Myir adapted to the harsh life outside of [[Narfell]]. They abandoned their nomadic ways in favor of becoming sedentary farmers since they were not able to compete with the fierce [[Khassadi]] people of the region.\n\nAs of the midâ€“14th century [[DR]], the Myir had been living a stationary existence for several centuries, but they were still poor in resources and technology compared to their neighbors."
