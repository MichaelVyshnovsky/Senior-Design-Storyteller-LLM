        "mainbody": "'''Clan Melairkyn''' was an ancient [[Dwarf|dwarven]] clan of artisans, explorers, and traders. Its mark was Dumathoin’s symbol with an axe as the inner gem’s border.",
        "History": "When King [[Melair I]] discovered deposits of [[mithral]] in the rock beneath [[Mount Waterdeep]] in {{Yearlink|-1288}}, the area was rapidly expanded into [[Melairbode]], later known as [[Undermountain]]. Their home was under increasing threat from the [[drow]] over the course of the centuries, until a huge attack in [[34 DR]] killed King [[Melair IV]], who was their ruler at the time, and forced them deeper into the mountain. They were driven out of Undermountain in [[211 DR]].\n\nSometime before [[Halaster's Higharvestide]] in [[1369 DR]], some of the surviving Clan Melairkyn worshipers of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] assembled [[Clangeddin's Hearth]], the organization with one goal - to take back the clan's ancient home deep in Undermountain. With Halaster's disappearance in 1369 DR, Clangeddin's Hearth seized the opportunity to establish an outpost in the clan's abandoned temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard in Undermountain. During the same period of time, [[drow]] reestablished their presence in Undermountain, often clashing with the dwarves.\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], Clangeddin's Hearth's dwarves attempted to wash a tribe of [[kobold]]s out of Undermountain's sewers. The drow used the kobolds as scouts and overwatch by the drow, led by Matron [[Azurna]], and this attack angered her enough to take decisive action against Clangeddin's Hearth. She led the squad of drow assassins to slaughter almost every dwarf in the temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard. To add insult to injury, she gifted the temple to her [[lich]] ally [[Morik Stormhand]], who desecrated the fallen dwarves' memory by bringing them back as his [[undead]] servants. Following the disastrous events of 1370 DR, only a handful of Clangeddin's Hearth members remained alive. Notably, [[Urkantor]] avoided the slaughter by being imprisoned at the time in [[Horazak]]'s ancient dwarven prison.",
        "Rumors": "Some scholars said that around one hundred dwarves from the Melairkyn clan escaped the final slaughter, fled Undermountain, and ventured west or south. Some claimed that they were involved in the creation of [[Phalorm]], the Fallen Kingdom, yet some maintained that the Melairkyn still populated the depths of Undermountain.",
        "Survivors": "In actual fact, a tiny number of members of the Melairkyn clan still existed by [[1370 DR]]:\n* [[Bandaerl]], son of Rykos, a dwarven priest of [[Dumathoin]] who became an [[archlich]] and still guarded the tomb of King Melair in lower Undermountain.\n* [[Corman Shieldstar]]\n* Lady [[Darlas Shieldstar]]\n* [[Daizez]], a dwarven historian who authored ''[[A Brief History of Undermountain]]''.\n* [[Gyudd]], the last direct descendant of the Melairkyn dwarves in [[Waterdeep]] as of [[1375 DR]].\n* [[Jaerloon Bucklebar]]\n* [[Jemuril]]\n* [[Kolrathanin]], Clangeddin's Hearth's dwarf who attempted too flush  kobolds out of Undermountain's sewers in 1370 DR.\n* [[Urkantor]], a member of Clangeddin's Hearth ''circa'' 1370 DR."
