The Panthers of Xi were a ninja clan based in the town of Xi in Koryo around 1357 DR. They controlled the Vorkani Mountains between Xi and the Malu River in the east.
Their clanmaster was Lin Goh, the wielder of the black kumade. The Panthers adopted this as a symbol, and left a black-painted kumade (a type of weaponized rake) as a sign of their handiwork or passing.
The Panthers waged an ongoing war with the Vioontu ninja clan, who were based in Manchar.
