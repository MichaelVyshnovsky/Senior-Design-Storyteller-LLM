The '''Panthers of Xi''' were a [[ninja]] clan based in the town of [[Xi]] in [[Koryo]] around [[1357 DR]]. They controlled the [[Vorkani Mountains]] between Xi and the [[Malu River]] in the east.

Their clanmaster was [[Lin Goh]], the wielder of the ''[[black kumade]]''. The Panthers adopted this as a symbol, and left a black-painted [[kumade]] (a type of weaponized rake) as a sign of their handiwork or passing.

The Panthers waged an ongoing war with the [[Vi'oontu]] ninja clan, who were based in [[Manchar]].
