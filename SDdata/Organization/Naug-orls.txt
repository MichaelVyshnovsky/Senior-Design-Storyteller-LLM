The '''Naug-orls''' (meaning "devil worms"), or simply the '''Worms''', were [[Zhentil Keep]]'s [[thieves' guild]] around [[1358 DR]].

==Organization==
The Worms were led by someone called the "Night Fingers". [[Shounra Shalassalar]] was the Night Fingers of the Worms by around [[1358 DR]]. All 600 members of the Worms reported to her through a secretive hierarchy.

In truth, however, the Night Fingers reported all the information collected to certain members of Zhentil Keep's [[Council of Lords (Zhentil Keep)|Council of Lords]]. However, Shounra's real master was [[Manshoon]]. However, the ties between criminal and official interests in Zhentil Keep were so strong that they usually acted more like a scout's company than thieves. 

==Activities==
Feared and shunned by the [[Zhent]]s, the Worms secretly frequented all taverns and inns within the city, spying for their master. The Worms would kidnap, frame, arrest, or commit murder in service to their master.

==Base of Operations==
The naug-orls operated out of the [[Thieves' Guildhall]] within the [[Zhentil Keep/Inner Quarter|Inner Quarter]] of Zhentil Keep.

==History==
The Naug-orls were seriously decimated in the [[1368 DR]] invasion by [[Cyric]]'s monstrous army and ceased to exist as organized force, although Shoundra tried to regroup her followers again.
