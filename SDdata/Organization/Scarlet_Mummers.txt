The '''Scarlet Mummers''' were a militant order of [[Lliira]]-worshiping assassins.

==Activities==
Their duties included protecting Lliiran temples and battling with [[Loviatar|Loviatans]]. Their battle prowess caused their fellows in the church to both fear and respect them.<ref>{{Cite web/Realmslore/The Scarlet Mummers}}

==History==
The order was formed to avenge the murder of [[Chlanna Asjros]], Lliira's High Revelmistress in [[Selgaunt]]. During the [[Time of Troubles]], Lliira had taken her as her lover, but a local cult of Loviatar murdered Chlanna, greatly affecting the Joybringer.

==Tactics==
Members of the order toured [[Faer√ªn]] hunting down agents of the Maiden of Pain. Their assassination tactics included an elaborate dance and the use of [[blade boot]]s and ''[[boots of tumbling]]''.<ref>
