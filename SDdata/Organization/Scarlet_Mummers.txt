The Scarlet Mummers were a militant order of Lliira-worshiping assassins.
Their duties included protecting Lliiran temples and battling with Loviatans. Their battle prowess caused their fellows in the church to both fear and respect them.
The order was formed to avenge the murder of Chlanna Asjros, Lliiras High Revelmistress in Selgaunt. During the Time of Troubles, Lliira had taken her as her lover, but a local cult of Loviatar murdered Chlanna, greatly affecting the Joybringer.
Members of the order toured Faer√ªn hunting down agents of the Maiden of Pain. Their assassination tactics included an elaborate dance and the use of blade boots and boots of tumbling.
