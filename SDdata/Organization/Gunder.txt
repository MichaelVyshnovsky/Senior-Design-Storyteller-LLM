The '''Gunders''' were the historical ruling family of [[Estagund]] in the [[Shining Lands]].

==History==
The Gunders ruled Estagund through turbulent times. They usually preferred raiding their neighbors which often got them into trouble. The Gunders were conquered by the [[Arkaiun]] under [[Reinhar I]] in [[551 DR]], and a half millenia later were laid to waste by the vengeful [[crinti]] of [[Dambrath]] after a failed invasion.

==Notable Members==
