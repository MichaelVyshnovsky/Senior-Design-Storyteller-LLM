The Gunders were the historical ruling family of Estagund in the Shining Lands.
The Gunders ruled Estagund through turbulent times. They usually preferred raiding their neighbors which often got them into trouble. The Gunders were conquered by the Arkaiun under Reinhar I in 551 DR, and a half millenia later were laid to waste by the vengeful crinti of Dambrath after a failed invasion.
