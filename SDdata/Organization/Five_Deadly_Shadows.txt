The '''Five Deadly Shadows''' were a group of assassins and a criminal organization in [[Kudoku]] in [[Kozakura]] around [[1479 DR]].

==Organization==
The Five Deadly Shadows represented the corruption of the virtues of the [[bushido]].

==History==
The wealth of Kudoku attracted the Five Deadly Shadows. They slowly infiltrated the city, corrupting everything.

When rumors of the corruption reached the ears of the provincial governor in 1479 DR, she sent the magistrate [[Hiro Yun]]. Step by step, Hiro efficiently shut down all the gang's operations and arrested most of its members until only the five leaders remained. At this point, Hiro challenged the assassins but in the end was defeated.{{Cite dungeon/195/The Five Deadly Shadows|1-19}}
