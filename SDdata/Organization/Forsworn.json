        "mainbody": "The '''Forsworn''' were a group of [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]]s that splintered off from the greater [[Gray Wolf tribe]] for much of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. They went against their fellow tribespeople when the Gray Wolf leaders aligned their tribe with the dark [[sorcerer]]s of returned [[Netheril]].\n\n{{Quote|The Netherese are a foul plague upon this world, corrupting everything they touch. They have cursed the Gray Wolf Tribe, turning them into bloodthirsty monsters.|[[Dying Howl]], Forsworn spirit.}}",
        "Activities": "The Forsworn dedicated themselves to dismantling [[Netherese]] operations in the lands around [[Vellosk]]. They took any opportunity they could to slay any agent of the [[Shadovar]].",
        "Base of Operations": "The Forsworn held their main camp near the Gray Wolf settlement of Vellosk, and established second, more secluded camp near the [[Netherese enclave|enclave]] of [[Xinlenal]].",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Shadovar returned to [[Toril]] and reformed the empire of [[Netheril]]. The arcanists of the [[Shadowfell]] drew in followers from among the native [[Faerûn]]ians, most notably the Gray Wolf tribe of the [[Sword Coast North]]. Tribe members that embraced [[lycanthropy]] as [[werewolves]] were utilized as the vanguard for the growing Netherese army. This led to tremendous casualties among the tribespeople, and many were left disillusioned. A select group of the Gray Wolf tribe attempted to rebel against their Netherese overlords but were quickly turned away. Rather than being killed outright, they were cast out by their fellow tribespeople―forced to live just beyond the borders of their ancestral home―and declared the Forsworn.\n\nSome time around the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, [[Thalos Oathbreaker]] reached out to Sergeant [[Alphonse Knox]] of the [[Neverwinter Guard]], seeking assistance with the reclamation of [[Gray Wolf Den]] from the Shadovar-aligned tribes members. Around that same time, the Forsworn [[shaman]] [[Kyrn Whitesky]] received a vision that a great hero would come to their aide. Eventually the [[Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge]] came to Thalos and helped consecrate the remains of slain Forsworn tribes members, before leading an assault against the Shadovar-aligned barbarians at Gray Wolf Den.",
        "Members": "* [[Dying Howl]], a [[spirit]] that remained in Faerûn with the Forsworn.\n* [[Hadrik Longtooth]], an elder Forsworn warrior.\n* [[Ragnar]], [[Belrak]], and [[Davian]], three Forsworn that were captured and tortured by the Netherese."
