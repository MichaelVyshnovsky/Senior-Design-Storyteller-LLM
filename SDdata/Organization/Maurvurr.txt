The Maurvurr were a group of magic-using brigands that operated out of the eastern edge of the Forest of Amtar in southeast Faer√ªn circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
The Maurvurr were unusual because they were a band of predominately sorcerers and wizards, and were only interested in acquiring spellbooks, magic items, spell components, and substances that could be used in alchemy. They preyed on caravans and travelers on the Traders Way north and west of Delzimmer, using whatever magical Art that would increase their knowledge and arsenal without putting themselves at great risk.
The Maurvurr lived in the fringe of the eastern Forest of Amtar close to the Traders Way.
The membership consisted of spellcasters of various races.
