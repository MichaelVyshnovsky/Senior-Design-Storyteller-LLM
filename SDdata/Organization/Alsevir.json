        "mainbody": "House Alsevir was a very old Cormyrian noble house which rose to the nobility around 200 DR.\nThe family was thought to have died out but a distant branch of the family returned to Cormyr in 1420 DR and took up residence in the old Bleth estate.\nThe family had built a considerable fortune as merchants before returning to Cormyr and, when they arrived in Suzail, began buying their way into high society. Their penchant for throwing around gold as well as their purchased titles earned them the dislike of House Crownsilver."
