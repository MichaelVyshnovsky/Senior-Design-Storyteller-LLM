The Eyes of the Darkbringer, who referred to themselves as the Darkeyes, was an organization of rogues who worshiped Moander, the Rotting God.
Agents of the Eyes of the Darkbringer were secretly placed within most major cities spread across Faer√ªn.
The Darkeyes carried out assassinations and served as spies for Moanders cult, warning the larger organization of potential threats in advance.
