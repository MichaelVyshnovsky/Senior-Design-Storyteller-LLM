The so-called '''Talvadarists''' were a collection of young wealthy inhabitants of [[Athkatla]], assembled in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
Talvadarists were inspired by a popular and enduring classic farce play performed by the Athkatla [[Crown Aflame]] theater: the ''[[Terrible Tale of Talvadar the Merchant]]''. The youths imitated the aforementioned Talvadar the Merchant and paraded themselves draped in red [[robe]]s similar to the character's garb. These Talvadarists believed that the only way to be happy was to ignore all dangers and unpleasantries of life, just like Talvadar the Merchant unwittingly did in the beloved farcical comedy. However, the most Talvadarists ever achieved were commotions and traffic disruptions on the busy Athkatlan street crossings.

==History==
Talvadarists first appeared ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}. They were also mentioned by [[Volothamp Geddarm]] in his guide to the [[Lands of Intrigue]], published in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
