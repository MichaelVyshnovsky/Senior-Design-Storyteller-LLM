        "mainbody": "Vilirith was an archaic noble elven house from the Time of Dragons.\nThe Vilirith territory coincided with the heart of King Orchtriens realm.\nThe Vilirith were vassals of Orchtrien, but they were not very loyal to him.\nIn , the house of Vilirith set an ambush together with the Starfall and Duskmere against some of Orchtriens forces in a forest within the heart of his own kingdom. They nearly defeated the arriving force, captained by Rhespen Ash, an elven wizard however, Prince Bexendral teleported into the battle and struck the traitors down before Rhespens surrender.\nAfter the rebellion was quashed, the heirs of the House were then taken to Dawnfire to learn and to serve as hostages, which would ensure the House remained in good behaviour."
