The '''House of Al-Cinel''' was one of the richest merchant families in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Base of Operations==
The House of Al-Cinel was based out of the [[Warehouse District of Huzuz]].

==History==
The House of Al-Cinel specialized in procuring larger rare items including statues, fountains, and tapestries.

This merchant family was able to acquire a [[Halruaan skyship]]. They kept it locked away within a warehouse where only members of the family were allowed to enter. Two [[elven]] [[mage]]s worked tirelessly to determine how the ship was able to achieve flight, though since they lacked the necessary control rod, their efforts were probably in vain.
