'''Windrunners''' was a [[Athasian thri-kreen]] tribe of insectoid nomads who lived in the desert of the [[Ringing Mountains]]'s foothills on the world of [[Athas]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In The Year of Despair, Malatran calendar, late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent from the [[Malatran Plateau]] through an elemental ''[[gate]]'' to the far-away world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by [[Athasian elf]] slavers. A young thri-kreen named [[Ka'cha]] was among creatures captured by the elves, and he lamented being separated from his clutch. Subsequently, the heroes escaped when the elven caravan was attacked by a hungry [[sink worm]]. They seized the opportunity and freed Ka'cha, fleeing from the pursuers across the desert.

After two days of travel across the hot sands, guided by Ka'cha, the group stumbled across the Windrunners tribe and their leader, [[Ki'rik'ku]]. Ka'cha convinced his tribe the strange adventurers were friends, not food. Happy with one of their number returned, chief Ki'rik'ku gifted the aliens four large [[erdlu]] [[egg]]s (an invaluable source of nourishment in the Athasian desert) and two [[enchanted]] ''[[potion fruit|apples of healing]]''. The thri-kreen explained to the Malatran heroes how to reach their destination—the [[Ringing Forest]]—the way back to [[Toril]]. After parting ways, Windrunners embarked on a quest of revenge against the slaver elves who'd wronged young Ka'cha.{{Cite organized play/LJ/Dark Suns|14}}
