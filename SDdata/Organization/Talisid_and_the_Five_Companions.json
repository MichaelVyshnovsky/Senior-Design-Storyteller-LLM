        "mainbody": "alisid and the Five Companions referred to a group of of guardinal paragons who protected the plane known as the House of Nature, much like a party of adventurers. They wandered the House of Nature and smashed any evil creatures that threatened the plane. The guardinals always existed here as far as anyone knew, and the companions had always solved disputes and led celestial warriors into battle. Members of the group retired once they deemed themselves unfit for service, but Talisid had been around for so long, hardly anyone could remember the name of the groups former leader. Occasionally, members of the group argued, but they did so as the dearest of friends with a loyalty to each other that put mere family loyalty to shame.\nThe membership of the group was last listed as follows\n* Talisid, the Celestial Lion Leader of the companions for several millenia, most powerful of the leonals.\n* Sathia, the Sky Duchess Representative of the avorals and patron of sculptors and painters.\n* Manath, the Horned Duke Representative of the cervidals and newest member of the Companions.\n* Vhara, Duchess of the Fields Representative of the equinals.\n* Kharash, the Stalker Paragon of lupinals and Talisids best friend.\n* Bharrai, the Great Bear Matriarch of the ursinals and teacher of magic.\nFormer members of the group included Zvestra, Windheir, Rhanok, Hwhyn, Lucan, and Callisto."
