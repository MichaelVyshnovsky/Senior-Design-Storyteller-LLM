        "mainbody": "'''Andelmaus Logging''' was a large logging and timber company headquartered in the city of [[Highmoon]] in the [[Dalelands]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They specialized in supplying much-needed timber to the nation of [[Sembia]], who were somewhat deprived of the naturally available resource.\n\nThe company was owned by an unscrupulous merchant named [[Kessia]] who would intermittently push into areas beyond where logging was allowed and put her company on probation with the local authority. She responded to this action by hiring [[mercenaries]] to guard her logging camps and warehouses."
