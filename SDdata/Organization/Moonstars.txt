The Moonstars, also known as the TelTeukiira, the Silverstars, or the Twelvestars, were a highly secretive group of individuals formed by Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun in the late 14 century DR with the aim of unifying the humans and other races (especially elves) against the forces of evil.
The Moonstars sought to preserve life and knowledge. They had a similar outlook to the Harpers, but dedicated themselves to Mystra, Oghma, and Sehanine Moonbow.
A passage from Amagals Tome (an ancient elven text from Cormanthor) declared
It was believed that only Khelben understood the relevance of these words.
Based in Waterdeep, the Moonstars followed much the same methods as the Harpers did, though the Moonstars operated in more secrecy than the Harpers and members were less free to do what they wanted, being under the direct and relatively strict command of the Blackstaff himself. Officially, the groups headquarters was Blackstaff Tower, though very few even visited that prestigious place. Each member carried a badge that allowed them access to their real stronghold, Silver Safehold, which was an extraplanar stronghold built by the Storm Heralds of Cormyr.
Of the gods who pledged their support to the Harpers, only three also supported the Moonstars Mystra, Oghma, and Sehanine Moonbow. But even with the lack of the other Harper gods blessings, Khelben and Laeral made up for it with their own spells.
To aid them in their quests to vanquish evil, the Moonstars had several permanent portals scattered around Faerûn to allow quick passage.
The Moonstars were officially formed in the , but this was only a step in a much larger plan by the organizations founder, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, who had sought to create his own evil-fighting organization for centuries before.
An offshoot of the Harpers, the Moonstars were formed when Khelben realized that he didnt have as much power over the Harpers as he once did. He discovered in the , that Alaundo the Seer had written prophecies about an as-yet-undiscovered threat to Faerûn. He attempted to steer the Harpers in a direction where they could deal with the threat but, failing that, he eventually took matters into his own hands. In the , Khelben stole the Scepter of the Sorcerer Kings from the Catacombs of Ordulin, making sure that it came into the possession of High Priest of Bane and leader of the Zhentarim, Fzoul Chembryl. Fzoul then used the scepter to destroy the banelich Faram Khaldan. Thirteen years later, in 1370 DR, the Harpers found out about Khelbens actions. He admitted his guilt during his trial at Twilight Hall and left the Harpers. Immediately after, he and his partner Laeral Silverhand set up the Tel Teukiira as part of a plan that Khelben had been developing for many years.
The organization appeared to collapse completely following Khelben’s death.
Renaer Neverember revived the Moonstars in the , after Vajra Safahr assumed the title "Blackstaff". However, the group decided they did not want to carry the Moonstars legacy, so they planned on creating a new organization that would be friends rather than agents of the Blackstaff. The organizations name was not decided at their first meeting.
In the month of Eleint, the , a moon elf mage and Moonstar named Questele was primarily responsible for defending Stedd Whitehorn, the boy Chosen of Lathander. She died trying to protect him.
Moonstar sleeper agents became active players in Waterdeep, Candlekeep, and Myth Drannor during the Second Sundering, but went underground after the conflict passed. It was unknown to outsiders what the relationship was between the Moonstars and the Harpers, or Open Lord Laeral Silverhand or Vajra Safahr for that matter.
Membership was less restrictive than the Harpers. One of the senior members was most definitely evil and the organization even listed a vampire amongst its number. To gain entry into the group, one needed the sponsorship of either Khelben or Laeral, so it was clear that they did not consider these less morally inclined members a threat. Many Harpers defected when Khelben created the Moonstars, including Malchor Harpell and Myrmeen Lhal.
