Part of the City Guard, it was a militia organization made up of soldiers, and griffons, responsible for defending and patrolling the great city.\nThe history of the Griffon Cavalry can perhaps be traced as far back as the second Trollwars (940 DR to 952 DR) when Ilithrew Belabranta rode his griffon into battle. One of his later heirs, Lord Palinor Belabranta, did the same versus the orc hordes of the Black Claw tribe in the . Since then, House Belabranta was a noble family associated with the breeding and training of griffons.\nIn the , Open Lord Ahghairon officially declared the Griffon Cavalry part of the City Guard during a huge orc siege on the city. The riders not only fought the orc hordes again, but were also used to shuttle in much needed supplies to the city.\nThe Griffon Cavalry later established a base of operations on the landward side of Mount Waterdeep called Peaktop Aerie, or Peaktop Eyrie. There they stabled over twenty griffons with another half-dozen housed at Castle Waterdeep.\nAs of 1479 DR, however, the Griffon Cavalry had been disbanded for years, as the griffons died in combat but were never replaced.\nThen, in the , Open Lord Laeral Silverhand proposed refounding the Griffon Cavalry, and threatened to make Mirt do it. Either way, this goal was achieved by the , with the newly procured griffons continuing to be supplied by the Belabranta family.\nthumb|250px|The Griffon Cavalry flying overhead.\nAlthough not all of the following people were official members of the Griffon Cavalry, each was known to ride and/or train a griffon in Waterdeeps defense\n*Ilithrew Belabranta Rode his mount during the Trollwars\n*Lord Palinor Belabranta Died in battle on his griffon in 1026 DR\n*Jhalathan Ilzoond Griffon-tamer of the Stablemasters & Farriers Guild circa 1368 DR, whose steed, Firebeak, was also housed at Castle Waterdeep\n*Jynnia Gundwynd Champion rider of many flying beasts circa 1368 DR.\n*Kerryn Belabranta Griffon-tamer  circa 1368 DR.\n*Malchor Harpell Adventurer  circa 1368 DR.\n*Lord Moedt Belabranta Leader of the Griffon Cavalry circa 1372 DR.\n*Xale of the Starry Glen Aasimar paladin and leader of the Knights of the Blue Moon on his griffon Arimaspea circa 1372 DR.\n*Sildar Hallwinter Retired knight and an agent of the Lords Alliance by 1491 DR.\n*Thurl Merosska Left the Griffon Cavalry to later become leader of the Feathergale Knights by 1491 DR.\n*Savra Belabranta Member of the Feathergale Knights, but was freed from the cults influence and joined the Order of the Gauntlet by 1492 DR.\nA griffon cavalrymans uniform was similar to other guardsmans, with polished armor and a black tabard with gold trim, but the tabard was also emblazoned with griffon.\nGriffon riders were also given either a ring of feather falling or a griffon badge of Waterdeep, which performed essentially the same function.\nIn addition to their other armament, the Griffon Cavalry often carried lances of burning blackfire into battle, wielding them to great effect atop their griffon steeds."
