        "mainbody": "The Right Pashas was one of the crews―or local street gangs―that operated in Baldurs Gate during the 1490s DR.\nThe Right Pashas held territory in Little Calimshan, a neighborhood in the Baldurian Outer City.\nThe crew worked in direct opposition to the the Guild of Baldurs Gate, and the Kingpin of Little Calimshan, Rilsa Rael. The Right Pashas viewed the criminal organization as outsiders to their neighborhood. They sought to rout her agents from the neighborhood in an ongoing gang war that broke out in the district each night.\nNot all of the crews activities were violent however. Some more wholesome members chose to spend their time selling brownies, to raise money to brighten the lives of Little Calimshans children."
