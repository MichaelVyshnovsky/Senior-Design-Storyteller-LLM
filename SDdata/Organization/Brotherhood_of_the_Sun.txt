The '''Brotherhood of the Sun''' was a monastic order dedicated to Amaunator.

==Organization==
The Brotherhood of the Sun's membership consisted of [[monk]]s. In fact, all monks who received their [[spell]]s from [[Amaunator]] were part of it.

==Activities==
The monks' duties included work at a temple dedicated to Amaunator like any other of his priests. However, the monks were a bit of an exception for they were exempted from it from time to time for their special duties, namely field work. They intermingled with the general populace of ancient [[Netheril]] and reassured them with the edicts of the Yellow God and ensured order among them.

==Tactics==
The monks of Amaunator were spellcasting priests but were not granted the ability to [[turn undead]] like the [[cleric]]s and [[sunlord]]s, the latter being Amaunator's [[specialty priest]]s.

==Base of Operations==
As mentioned above, the monks were temporarily exempt from temple duties and had their own duties. However, they were still attached to a temple of Amaunator and had to make at least annual reports to the temple they were part of.

==Relationships==
The Brotherhood of the Sun was part of the [[church of Amaunator]]. They were also the forebears of the [[Order of the Sun Soul]].

==History==
The Brotherhood of the Sun was active during the days of ancient Netheril as a monastic order dedicated to Amaunator. The former happened in {{Yearlink|-339}}, the latter happened a thousand years after that.

After the death of Amaunator, the monks stopped being a uniform force. Each monastery chose a new [[deity]] for itself, mostly [[Lathander]], then [[Sel√ªne]], and then [[Sune]]. They became the [[Order of the Sun Soul]].
