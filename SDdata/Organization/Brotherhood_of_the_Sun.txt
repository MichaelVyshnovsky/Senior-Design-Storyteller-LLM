The Brotherhood of the Sun was a monastic order dedicated to Amaunator.
The Brotherhood of the Suns membership consisted of monks. In fact, all monks who received their spells from Amaunator were part of it.
The monks duties included work at a temple dedicated to Amaunator like any other of his priests. However, the monks were a bit of an exception for they were exempted from it from time to time for their special duties, namely field work. They intermingled with the general populace of ancient Netheril and reassured them with the edicts of the Yellow God and ensured order among them.
The monks of Amaunator were spellcasting priests but were not granted the ability to turn undead like the clerics and sunlords, the latter being Amaunators specialty priests.
As mentioned above, the monks were temporarily exempt from temple duties and had their own duties. However, they were still attached to a temple of Amaunator and had to make at least annual reports to the temple they were part of.
The Brotherhood of the Sun was part of the church of Amaunator. They were also the forebears of the Order of the Sun Soul.
The Brotherhood of the Sun was active during the days of ancient Netheril as a monastic order dedicated to Amaunator. The former happened in , the latter happened a thousand years after that.
After the death of Amaunator, the monks stopped being a uniform force. Each monastery chose a new deity for itself, mostly Lathander, then Sel√ªne, and then Sune. They became the Order of the Sun Soul.
