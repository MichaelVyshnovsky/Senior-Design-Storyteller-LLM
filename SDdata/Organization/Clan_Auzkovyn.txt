Clan Auzkovyn was the second biggest faction of drow living in Cormanthor in 1372 DR, They numbered about 3500,
The clan was named after the founder of the clan.
The clan wandered in Upper Underdark for centuries. At some point during the 12th century DR, they had settled in High Forest with the intent on founding a permanent state. But due to increasing hostilities from the wood elves, who intended found a state too, they decided to leave the High Forest.
In 1371 DR, members of Clan Auzkovyn created a portal which opened near the Abbey of the Sword. They moved to the forest of Cormanthor, to populate the lands the elves abandoned in their Retreat.
Once on the surface, they decided to lead a nomadic lifestyle in Cormanthor instead of forming permanent settlements. They had good relationships with House Jaelre, the biggest drow group in Cormanthor, both on organization level as they didnt kill each others trespassers Their relationship with House Jaerle improved later to a full alliance called the Masked Brigades.
