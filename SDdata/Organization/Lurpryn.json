        "mainbody": "The '''Lurpryn''' family was one of the [[Onsruur]]&mdash;the council of twenty lords, each from a different prominent family&mdash;that held sway in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|87}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 66: Khôltar, Part 17, More on the Onsruur}}",
        "Organization": "The Lurpryn were a handsome bloodline with dark skin, dark hair, and [[emerald]]-green eyes. They took their superior status very seriously: they never allowed anyone, commoner or elite, to see them doing anything resembling work; and they rarely showed more than casual interest in activities, trends, or ideas that were not their own. To outward appearances, this family epitomized sloth.",
        "Activities": "Behind closed doors, the Lurpryn were deep into the slave trade and had extensive investments in drug smugglers. They also kept thugs and assassins around for special jobs or hired them out. The most mundane of their financial interests was in rental property."
