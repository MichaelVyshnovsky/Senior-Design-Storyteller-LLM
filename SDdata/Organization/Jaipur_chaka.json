        "mainbody": "The Jaipur chaka was a successful chaka within the Shining Lands in 1367 DR.\nThe Jaipurs owned thousands of acres of farmland in Var the Golden. However, the majority of their financial success came from their sea trade. They were second to none within the Shining Lands in delivering goods across the Shining South and beyond, including two successful ventures to distant Maztica.\nAs of 1367 DR, they hoped to supplant the Baroda chaka with one of their members for the fifth seat on the Council of Merchants.\nThe Jaipur chaka was based out of Myrmyr in eastern Var the Golden."
