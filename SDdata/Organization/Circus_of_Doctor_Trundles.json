        "mainbody": "he Circus of Doctor Trundles was a circus, run by Dr. Trundles and Tanaroo Quinson, that traveled Impiltur and Damara with a collection of monsters in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nWhenever the circus went through the town of Valls, there was always excitement. The parade often started at noon. Each creature was set in a cage of imprisonment that resembles a circus wagon, which neutralized any magical abilities from the creatures within. The magic did not, however, inhibit the physical strength of the creatures.\nIn 1357 DR, when the circus visited the town of Valls, the monsters were\n* a bulette,\n* a chimera,\n* an ancient blue dragon,\n* a lamia,\n* a foxwoman,\n* a xorn, and\n* a gibbering mouther.\nIn Valls in late summer or early autumn of the , the bulette burst out of its magical cage and furiously attacked the other cages, freeing the other monsters. All monsters except the bulette were recaptured, as the bulette went on to terrorize Halfling Downs in Carmathan for the next two years. While only minor losses were inflicted on Valls, the disaster damaged the circuss reputation. Trundles handed the reins of ringmaster to Tanaroo Quinson and stepped back to a less-active role. The circus moved south to Impiltur in effort to rebuild the circuss reputation and business. It was at the scene of the disaster, however, that Gareth Dragonsbane and his companions helped recapture the rampaging monsters and caught the attention of two refugees from Bloodstone Village, leading eventually to the towns liberation from evil Vaasans.\nIn Impiltur, Trundles and his circus were accepted by the Lords of Imphras II provided that security be enhanced. The circus employed 27 fighters, with three guarding each cage and instructed how to best deal with the monsters within.\nAs of 1359 DR, the bulette was gone and four new creatures had joined the cast\n* a pair of leucrotta,\n* a manticore, and\n* an umber hulk."
