The Dome Dancers were a religious organization in Zakhara whose members followed the teachings of Haku, the Zakharan god of freedom.
The Dome Dancers wielded scimitars in both hands.
Similar to the Dancing Dwarves, the Dome Dancers were mystics known as dervishes. They derived their power from vigorous dancing and twirling.
Their main goal was to completely free the desert tribes from any influence of the great cities of Zakhara. They would regularly join various desert tribes in raids on the civilized folk.
As of 1367 DR, there were 500 Dome Dancers in Zakhara.
The Desert Mosque within the northern regions of the High Desert was their center of power.
