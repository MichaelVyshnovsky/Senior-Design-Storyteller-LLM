Sunblight was an ambitious duergar clan residing in and beneath the Spine of the World mountains of Faerûn.
To support their expansion into the surface of Faerûn, the clan erected the fortress Sunblight in the Spine of the World, serving as a kind of gateway between the clans Underdark holdings and the surface.
Under the leadership of Xardorok Sunblight, the Sunblight clan expanded aggressively into the surface world. Xardoroks ambition was stoked by Asmodeus, who adopted the guise of the duergar deity Deep Duerra to manipulate the dwarven warlord into conquering Icewind Dale.
The Sunblight clan was fraught with murder and intrigue. Xardorok Sunblight was married three times and had nine children in total. He killed his first wife, Thizrun, and first son, Ulthoon, for plotting against him. Yrraska, his second wife, was killed in a tunnel collapse, while his third wife Marral died fighting mind flayers. Nearly all of his remaining children died in these two incidents as well, leaving him with only two living sons as of the .
Xardoroks aspirations for the Sunblight clan were ultimately foiled, and their fortress was taken over by a tribe of kobolds.
