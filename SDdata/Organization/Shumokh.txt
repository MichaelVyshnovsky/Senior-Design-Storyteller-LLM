The Shumokh family was an influential mercantile house of Eshpurta in Amn in the 14 century DR.
The Shumokhs had traditionally dealt in blacksmithing and armorcrafting, but Lord Bhaem pursued his own interest in lute-making and built a small fortune doing so.
* Lord Bhaem Shumokh, the family leader circa 1370 DR and member of Eshpurtas ruling Shield Council alongside the Craumerdaun, Dannihyr, Gheldieg, Keltronn, and Krimmevol families.
