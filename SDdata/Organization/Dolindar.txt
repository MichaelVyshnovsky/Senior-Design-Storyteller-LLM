The '''Dolindars''' were a family of [[wizard]]s who were banished to the [[Shadowfell]] sometime long before the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Vecna-time}} The family settled in [[Evernight]], becoming a rarity in that city: living [[human]]s. There they studied [[arcane magic]] and came to be experts on the subject of interplanar travel.

In addition to the Dolindars' modest wealth, they owned a number of family treasures, including: a copy of the book ''[[Out of the Endless Prison]]'', a ''[[driftglobe]]'' adorned with a map of the [[gate-town]]s, a [[gold]] [[helmet]], a ''[[necklace of adaptation]]'' inscribed with "My breath is yours, [[Kevetta Dolindar|Kevetta]]â€”take it", and a [[snow globe]] containing a miniature replica of [[Neverwinter]].

==History==
The reason for the Dolindars' exile was lost to history, but it was known that the family bore a [[curse]] that rendered them unable to use ''[[portals]]'' to travel between [[plane]]s, thus trapping them in the Shadowfell.

At some point, the family built [[Dolindar Tomb|a tomb]] for themselves and managed to install a permanent ''portal'' to [[Neverwinter]]&mdash;known as a [[Crevice of Dusk]]&mdash;deep inside of it. However, they were evidently unable to use this ''portal'' to escape from Evernight owing to their curse. They subsequently hired a caretaker for the tomb named [[Newmy]], and by paying her many lifetimes' wages up front, they bound her to maintain the tomb even after her death.

The family eventually passed away and were interred in their family tomb alongside their treasures. As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, Evernight's more ancient residents (such as the [[vampire]] [[Sangora]]) still remembered the Dolindars.

==Members==

The family was relatively small and insular. It included at least twelve members, all of whom were lonely and miserable following their banishment to the Shadowfell. These emotions would continue to haunt them long after their deaths.

Notable members included:
*[[Kevetta Dolindar]], the family matriarch. She arose in death as a [[lonely sorrowsworn|lonely]] [[sorrowsworn]].
*[[Evisha Dolindar]], an important daughter of the family. She arose in death as a [[lost sorrowsworn|lost]] sorrowsworn.
*[[Nolan Dolindar]], brother to Evisha. He likewise arose in death as a lost sorrowsworn.
