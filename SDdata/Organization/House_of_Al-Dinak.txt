The House of Al-Dinak was one of the richest merchant families in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
After experiencing a slew of devastating caravan attacks, the House of Al-Dinak began hiring adventurers to guard their caravans.
The House of Al-Dinak was based out of the Warehouse District of Huzuz.
The House of Al-Dinak was a sworn enemy of the House of Al-Danafi. They recently closed one of their warehouses, prompting an insultingly low offer from Al-Danafi to purchase the holding.
Al-Dinak dealt with a variety of trade goods. The combination of poor decision-making and bad luck on the caravan trails left them dealing with hard times. Their financial situation lead others to believe that their goods possessed poor quality.
