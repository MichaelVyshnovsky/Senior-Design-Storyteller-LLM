The Bloody Eye tribe was an orcish tribe that inhabited the High Forest in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
The orcs lived in small villages and underground tunnels in the High Forest, located around two days journey from the forests edge.
Their tribal symbol and totem was of course a bloody eye.
Like many of the High Forest orc tribes, the Horned Lord tribe worshiped Herne the Wild Hunter.
The members of this tribe possessed many of the forestry skills typical of rangers.
The members of this tribe were often at odds with human, elf, and half-elf rangers.
