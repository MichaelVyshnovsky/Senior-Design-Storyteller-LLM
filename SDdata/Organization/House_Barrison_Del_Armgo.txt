'''House Barrison Del'Armgo''' was a high-ranking noble [[drow]] house of [[Menzoberranzan]].

==Activities==
The house was known for its wizards and warriors; its might was not based in the clergy.

Until [[1484 DR]], warriors from House Barrison Del'Armgo and [[House Melarn]] trained together (against the order of the Ruling Council) in the ruined [[House Do'Urden]] compound.

==Headquarters==
House Barrison Del'Armgo was originally located in [[Narbondellyn]], but in the late 15th century [[Dale Reckoning|DR]] it relocated to [[Qu'ellarz'orl]].

==History==
House Barrison Del'Armgo was the second-youngest house (in [[1484 DR]]) of Menzoberranzan, having been formed some eight centuries earlier. Around [[1230 DR]], it was the 47th house, then it jumped to the 16th house. The house was second house as of [[1372 DR]] and still remained in that position in [[1484 DR]].

==Relationships==
House Barrison Del'Armgo was strong but had few allies, preferring to stand by itself.

==Members==
In [[1484 DR]], House Barrison Del'Armgo had 1,000 soldiers, which formed the backbone of their garrison.
