As of 1374 DR, the council meetings had reached around a tenday in length.\nThe council was made up of 30 members, of which 11 were from major cities and the others were from smaller villages in Aglarond. The Fang and Dahst did not recognize their being part of Aglarond at all, and therefore did not send a councilor. Most of the positions on the council were hereditary positions held by the nobility of a particular province or city.\nThe council was originally formed when Aglarond was created in 1065 DR. \nCategoryCouncils\nCategoryOrganizations in Veltalar\nCategoryOrganizations in Aglarond\nCategoryOrganizations in the Unapproachable East\nCategoryOrganizations in East Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\n50zlcdut4c5sbq1zz2ewf1c2v0yqca2"
