        "Activities": "The Sisterhood wandered [[west Faerûn]] sharing prophecies and visions with those willing to pay a modest fee. While accurate, the visions were often clouded so that the recipient usually only appreciated their value in hindsight. Most of the members of the Sibylline Sisterhood were novice [[sibylite]]s."
