        "mainbody": "The Empty-Scabbard Killers, or Forak-Erach-Naek in an obscure Dwarvish dialect, were a legendary order of duergar psionic assassins in Gracklstugh, whom common people believed to be mythical.\nMembers were often assassins and soulknives, who could manifest a blade of psychic energy, hence the name \"empty scabbard\".\nEmpty-Scabbard Killers patrolled the streets of Gracklstugh searching for psionically gifted children to abduct and train. They even recruited gifted calassabrak (a kind of duergar outlaw shunned by other duergar).\nThey usually conducted deadly missions for a select few personalities of the city, However, they would work and kill for anyone who had the gold.\nThe headquarters of the Forak-Erach-Naek was a well-guarded secret. However, those who would hire them knew they could get in contact with one of the killers in the Cave of Twelve Teeth, which stood by the edge of the Darklake just outside Gracklstugh. They were possibly based near the Darklake.\nThe Empty-Scabbard Killers were already notorious by 1373 DR. By then, theyd recently extended their services to kidnapping for ransom.\nAround 1374 DR, the Forak-Erach-Naek attempted to assassinate Urdol, the aboleth ruler of Dupapn. They failed, and Urdol declared war on the Forak-Erach-Naek in retaliation, a situation that would quickly and almost certainly erupt into chaos.\nCirca 1486 DR, they&mdashfor unknown reasons&mdashtargeted the merchant Werz Saltbaron."
