        "Members": "Members were often [[assassin]]s and [[soulknife|soulknives]], who could manifest a blade of psychic energy,<ref> hence the name \"empty scabbard\".",
        "Operations": "Empty-Scabbard Killers patrolled the streets of Gracklstugh searching for psionically gifted children to abduct and train. They even recruited gifted ''[[calassabrak]]'' (a kind of duergar outlaw shunned by other duergar).\n\nThey usually conducted deadly missions for a select few personalities of the city, However, they would work and kill for anyone who had the [[gold]].",
        "Base": "The headquarters of the Forak-Erach-Naek was a well-guarded secret. However, those who would hire them knew they could get in contact with one of the killers in the [[Cave of Twelve Teeth]], which stood by the edge of the [[Darklake]] just outside Gracklstugh. They were possibly based near the Darklake.",
        "History": "The Empty-Scabbard Killers were already notorious by [[1373 DR]]. By then, they'd recently extended their services to kidnapping for ransom.\n\nAround [[1374 DR]], the Forak-Erach-Naek attempted to assassinate [[Urdol]], the [[aboleth]] ruler of [[Dupapn]]. They failed, and Urdol declared war on the Forak-Erach-Naek in retaliation, a situation that would quickly and almost certainly erupt into chaos.\n\n''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], they&mdash;for unknown reasons&mdash;targeted the merchant [[Werz Saltbaron]]."
