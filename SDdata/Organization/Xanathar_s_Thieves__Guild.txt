Xanathars Thieves Guild, or simply Xanathar Guild, was a criminal and slaving organization in Waterdeep and Skullport run by a paranoid elder beholder.
This criminal and slaver network was one of the most powerful on the Sword Coast, but often unintentionally acted as a buffer against other evil organizations. They operated out of Skullport, but were otherwise largely active in Waterdeep.
Members of the guild were trained in stealth, discretion, and tactics with fighters, rogues, sorcerers, wizards, and experts, which comprised most of its numbers. An ever-growing organization, it utilized multiple mouthpieces to protect and conceal the identity of the Xanathar. To join, a member had to prove their ruthlessness, obedience, and loyalty by committing a serious crime—killing or selling a friend or family member into slavery—as well as paying 300 gp. The typical agent earned dues of 60 gp a month.
Support generally came in these ways
* Any member given an assignment would receive a bodyguard or assistant, such as a bugbear, wererat, kenku, or gazer, with secret instructions to spy on and assassinate the agent in case of failure.
* The guild provided safe refuges such as cellars in the sewers.
Among the low-ranking guild members, no-one really knew who Xanathar was. Few had an inkling he was a beholder, and fewer still had spoken to him.
Given that the faction was evil at the core, advancement through assassination was a popular "shortcut".

Some of the more unusual members of the guild in the late 1400s DR were a group of five dwarves that had been modified by the mind flayer Nihiloor to operate and serve as a surveillance system for the Xanathar.
The Xanathar Guild was also known to employ a number of goblins and bugbears, some of whom were infected with intellect devourers, presumably by Nihiloor.
