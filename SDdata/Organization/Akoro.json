        "mainbody": "The Akoro was a tribe of goliaths that dwelled in the Abbey Mountains for hundreds of years at least. \nThey lived atop Mount Akoro, a peak found along the southern side of the range, overlooking the Tortured Land to the south. \nThe tribe was believed to be active during the Golden Age of ancient Netheril, well into at least the Shadowed Age.\nIn the , the Akoro goliaths joined a motley coalition of forces from the Moonsea North, alongside the gnolls of Frozen Flindyke, the gnomes of Forharn, and men from the realms of Horreb, Barze, and Varm, to combat an evil primordial being from the Elemental Chaos known as Maram of the Great Spear. \nThe history of the Akoro was included in the book, Heart of the Mountain, a rather contentious work that detailed the history of goliaths in Faer√ªn. The author postulated that the Akoro were once men of the Rengarth barbarian tribes who ascended the Columns of the Sky Mountains, as the Abbey Mountains were then known, in order to force answers from the gods in which they had lost their faith."
