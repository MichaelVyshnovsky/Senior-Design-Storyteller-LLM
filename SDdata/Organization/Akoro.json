        "Rumors & Legends": "The history of the Akoro was included in the book, ''[[Heart of the Mountain]]'', a rather contentious work that detailed the history of goliaths in [[Faer√ªn]]. The author postulated that the Akoro were once men of the [[Rengarth]] [[barbarian]] tribes who ascended the Columns of the Sky Mountains, as the Abbey Mountains were then known, in order to force answers from the gods in which they had lost their faith."
