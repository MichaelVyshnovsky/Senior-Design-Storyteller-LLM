        "mainbody": "The '''Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen''' was an association of individuals who owned and operated various means of conveyance to earn income within the city of [[Waterdeep]]. These included but were not limited to those who drove carriages, carts, and sleighs and who carried [[litter]]s or pulled [[rickshaw]]s to transport others throughout the city streets.\n\nGuild members were granted the freedom of inspection by [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|city watchmen]], unless under direct order of a magister or [[Lords of Waterdeep|City Lord]]. However, they were not exempt from being searched by the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]].",

            "Costs": "Entrance fees to the guild varied, depending on ownership of the prospective member. Single cart or litter owners were charged 10 [[gp]] and those with multiple means of conveyance were charged 25 gp. Guild dues were a monthly fee of 5 [[sp]]."
        },
        "Uniform": "The guild's livery consisted of navy blue cloaks and long-brimmed caps, both of which were lined with silver.",
        "History": "For many years, guild members tried to gain a legal monopoly on the transportation of people and goods throughout the city of Waterdeep. These actions were prevented by the Lords during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]] when they explicitly forbade any restrictions on the use or ownership of inter-city conveyances, and the guild gave up in the 1350s DR."
