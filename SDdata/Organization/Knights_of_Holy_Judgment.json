        "mainbody": "The Knights of Holy Judgment were an order of paladins that faithfully focused on the lawful tenets of their patron deity Tyr.\nThe Knights were very close to the Knights of the Merciful Sword, both of whose members were the only faithful of Tyr who were eligible to join the ranks of the Hammers of Grimjaws.\nMuch of their energy was devoted to hunting criminals and monsters in order to bring them to justice. In fact, they specialized in the hunting of devils.\nSome of the elite members of the Knights of Holy Judgment might receive an invitation to join the Hammers of Grimjaws."
