The Council of Six was the governing body of Mistledale during the 14 century DR. Its representatives included local leaders, village chiefs, and distinguished farmers who were informally elected from all the corners of the dale. The council met four times a year, once per season, to discuss pressing matters of Mistledale.
A High Councilor was chosen from among the council, to handle the day-to-day administration of the dale as well as command its law enforcement, the Riders of Mistledale. The High Councilors symbol of power was the Rod of Peldan.
