The '''Council of Six''' was the governing body of [[Mistledale]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Its representatives included local leaders, village chiefs, and distinguished farmers who were informally elected from all the corners of the dale. The council met four times a year, once per season, to discuss pressing matters of Mistledale.

A High Councilor was chosen from among the council, to handle the day-to-day administration of the dale as well as command its law enforcement, the [[Riders of Mistledale]]. The High Councilor's symbol of power was the ''[[Rod of Peldan]]''.
