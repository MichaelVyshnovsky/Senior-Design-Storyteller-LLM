'''The Soft Claws''' were a mercenary group based in the [[Moonstone Mask]] in [[Neverwinter]]. They were secretly led by the [[steel dragon]] [[Zundaerazylym]], who gave each one of her mercenaries magical tokens called ''[[Zundaerazylym's nevertoken]]s''.<ref>{{Cite dragon/259/Wyrms of the North: Zundaerazylym}}

==Activities==
They operated as far east as [[Suzail]] and as south as [[Baldur's Gate]].  Their duties included spying, fetching, relocating [[dragon]]s, creating desirable lairs, planting rumors about the lairs, and planting information on the lairs near existing dragons.

==Members==
Sometime in the 14{{th}} century they numbered more than sixty [[humans]], [[halflings]], [[elves]], and [[half-elves]] drawn from people that included traders, woodcarvers, and adventurers. Zundaerazylym suspected some members might be members of [[Heralds of Faer√ªn|the Heralds]] or [[the Harpers]]. Members included [[Bruldin Oldturret]], [[Tamaer Shiversword]], [[Jhavaerra Erbrand]], and [[Iorl Skyndul]].
