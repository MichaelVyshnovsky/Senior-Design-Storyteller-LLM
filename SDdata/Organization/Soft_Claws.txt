The Soft Claws were a mercenary group based in the Moonstone Mask in Neverwinter. They were secretly led by the steel dragon Zundaerazylym, who gave each one of her mercenaries magical tokens called Zundaerazylyms nevertokens.
They operated as far east as Suzail and as south as Baldurs Gate.  Their duties included spying, fetching, relocating dragons, creating desirable lairs, planting rumors about the lairs, and planting information on the lairs near existing dragons.
Sometime in the 14 century they numbered more than sixty humans, halflings, elves, and half-elves drawn from people that included traders, woodcarvers, and adventurers. Zundaerazylym suspected some members might be members of the Heralds or the Harpers. Members included Bruldin Oldturret, Tamaer Shiversword, Jhavaerra Erbrand, and Iorl Skyndul.
