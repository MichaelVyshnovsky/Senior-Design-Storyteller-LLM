        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Fallowgar's Furies were believed to had been dead for a decade, perished in the [[Weldath]] forest of [[Tethyr]]. The band's name, however, was remembered thanks to stories of the women's treasures buried nearby the [[Hunter's Tree]]. Along with another group â€“ [[The Striking Talons]]'s treasures, it was believed that Fallowgar's Furies buried some [[elf|elven]] magic items, [[coin]]s, and [[gem]]s the adventurers collected as they adventured in the [[Forest of Tethir]]."
