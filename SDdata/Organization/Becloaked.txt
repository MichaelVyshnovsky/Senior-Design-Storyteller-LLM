The '''Becloaked''' were a group of eerie and enigmatic [[druid]]s who inhabited [[The Archdruid's Grove]] in [[Mosstone]].

==Organization==
Druids only known as the [[Becloaked]] were truly a mysterious bunch. These individuals of unknown gender wore gray-colored thick, heavily-cowled [[robe]]s that completely obfuscated their features, faces, and showed no skin.

==Base of Operations==
Three of these Becloaked druids were always seen patrolling the Archdruid's Grove under the commands of the [[Archdruid]] himself. The Becloaked slowly walked their strange routes, and no one seemed to know the patrols' purpose. On occasions, they gathered around a random [[tree]] and stayed motionless for several minutes until resuming the route. The Becloaked spoke rarely and always in harshly whispered questions when addressed, like "Don't you have anything better to do?" Young acolyte druids tended to avoid the Becloaked, moving to the opposite side of a path and scattering out of the robed figures' way. On the other hand, the [[watchghost]]s that inhabited the Archdruid's Grove paid the Becloaked no mind.

==History==
According to [[Volothamp Geddarm]]'s testimony recorded in the infamous writer's guide to [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]] published in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], he once witnessed a glimpse of a Becloaked's hand â€“ covered in tiny green iridescent scales. However, Volo was unsure if what he saw was simply a lightly-fitted glove.
