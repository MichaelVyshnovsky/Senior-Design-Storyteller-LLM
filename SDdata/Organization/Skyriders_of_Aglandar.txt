The '''Skyriders of Aglandar''' were an order of [[dwarven]] knights from the [[Great Rift]] in the [[Shining South]]. These champions of the [[Morndinsamman|dwarven]] goddess of luck in battle, [[Haela Brightaxe]], were famed for their aerial [[hippogriff]] mounts.

While they protected their kin, and defended their homeland from monsters, they seldom traveled far from the Rift. If they did, it was often to pursue threats to the realm or deliver dire messages to allies abroad.
