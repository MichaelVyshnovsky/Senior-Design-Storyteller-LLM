'''House of Yarthin''' was a collective of miners and traders who operated in the far [[Northwest Faerûn|north]] of [[Faerûn]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
House of Yarthin members operated quarries in secret locations near [[Ironmaster]], obtaining valuable stone such as [[whetstone]]s. They were represented at large by [[Alander Yarthin]] from their base in [[Calling Horns]], who dealt with other businesses. It was linked by [[merchants' map]] to [[Samril's Fine Blades]] in [[Secomber]] and [[the Arthane Armory]] in [[Waterdeep]], who used the whetstones for sharpening the blades of freshly-made weapons such as [[longsword]]s
