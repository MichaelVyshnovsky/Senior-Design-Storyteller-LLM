        "mainbody": "The '''Grand Army of the Tuigan''', also simply called the '''Horde''', was a formidable fighting force that was assembled by [[Yamun Khahan]] and rose to prominence in the [[Hordelands]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Organization": "Formed mostly of horsemen, Yamun Khahan's army was fast, efficient, and lethal. The army was organized as follows:\n* ''Arban'' - group of 10 soldiers, led by one sergeant\n* ''Jagun'' - 10 arbans or 100 soldiers, led by one commander\n* ''Minghan'' - 10 jaguns or 1,000 soldiers, led by a khan\n* ''Tumen'' - 10 minghans or 10,000 soldiers led by individuals selected by the Great Khan\n* Army Commanders - sons or trusted generals of Yamun Khahan, each had command of 2–6 (or more) ''tumens''\n\nYamun Kahan's army numbered over 300,000 strong during the height of its power. However, their main strength lay not in sheer numbers, which they certainly possessed, but in the accountability of each individual soldier. If one man within an ''arban'' committed a crime, then all 10 men of that ''arban'' were punished. Similarly, if a single man distinguished himself during combat, then all were praised and honored. This iron-willed mentality transformed simple soldiers into something far greater.\n\nIn the time of Yamun's successor, [[Hubadai Khahan]], this army had expanded to include a vanguard of [[hobgoblin]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[hill giant]]s.",

        "Tactics": "The Horde always carried four times as many horses as men. This allowed for their swift movement which often made it easy for them to surprise and surround their slower adversaries.\n\nAll individuals of the various tribes of the Hordelands began their training with horses at a very early age. Children learned the art of controlling their mounts to work alone and in coordinated groups. As adults, the Tuigans were masters of horseback feints, feigned retreats, and forced encirclement.\n\nYamun Kahan pioneered the skilled use of drums, flags, horns, and standards to communicate during pitched battle, giving his fighting force a huge advantage over any opponent they faced on the field. Through strict practice and drilling, he was able to effectively communicate with the commanders of his ''tumens'' during battle. It was suspected that he learned, and further developed, these techniques from the [[Shou]].\n\nYamun also mastered the use of the feinting charge: a tactic where he would charge the enemy to nearly within range of their missiles, fire a volley of his own, and gather intelligence on the strengths of his enemy. More often than not, when faced with such a massive charge of horsemen, the enemy would instantly commit their most dangerous and mobile weapons, allowing the Tuigan ample time to counter.",
        "Base of Operations": "Though they rose to power on the vast steppes of the Hordelands, the Horde ranged over a considerable amount of territory including [[Semphar]], [[Khazari]], [[Shou Lung]], and parts of [[Faerûn]] such as [[Thay]], [[Thesk]] and [[Rashemen]]."
