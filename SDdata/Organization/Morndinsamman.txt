The '''Morndinsamman''' (a [[dwarven]] term meaning "shield brothers on high" or "high dwarves") or '''Moradinsamman'''. was the group name of the [[dwarven]] [[pantheon]].

==Base of Operations==
The majority of the Morndinsamman resided in [[Dwarfhome]] (when it was still located on [[Mount Celestia]]) under the leadership of [[Moradin]], creator of the dwarves. [[Duerra]] and [[Laduguer]] lived in [[Hammergrim]], having been exiled by Moradin.

==History==
In [[1383 DR]], Moradin led the Morndinsamman on a crusade against the dark powers of Hammergrim, slaying Duerra and Laduguer, but at the cost of Gorm and Haela.<ref>

As of [[1479 DR]], Moradin, [[Berronar]], [[Clangeddin]], [[Dugmaren]], [[Dumathoin]], [[Marthammor]], [[Sharindlar]], [[Thard]], and [[Vergadain]] remained in Dwarfhome as part of the Morndinsamman.<ref><ref> [[Abbathor]] was serving [[Bane]] as an [[exarch]] in [[Banehold]]<ref>

Following the [[Second Sundering]], by the end of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], thirteen of the Morndinsamman deities appeared to have been restored to their portfolios as they were before the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]] and the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]]; the exception was [[Thard Harr]], whose status at the time was unknown. The exact circumstances of their return are unclear.

==Members==
The gods of the Morndinsamman were:<ref><ref>
* [[Moradin]], greater god and chief among the Morndinsamman; he was the god of creation and crafts, and the dwarven race as a whole.
* [[Berronar Truesilver]], intermediate goddess of hearth and home; consort of Moradin and matriarch of the dwarven pantheon.
* [[Dumathoin]], intermediate god of mining, gems, and underground exploration.
* [[Sharindlar]], intermediate goddess of fertility, romantic love, and healing.
* [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], god of battle, valor, and honor in combat.
* [[Vergadain]], god of trade, wealth, negotiation, luck, trickery, and chance.
* [[Dugmaren Brightmantle]], god of scholarship, discovery, and invention.
* [[Gorm Gulthyn]], god of vigilance, defense, and protection.
* [[Haela Brightaxe]], goddess of luck and battle.
* [[Marthammor Duin]], god of wanderers.
* [[Thard Harr]], god of survival, hunting, and nature.
* [[Abbathor]], god of greed.
* [[Hanseath]], god of war, carousing, alcohol.
* [[Tharmekh√ªl]], demipower of the forge and molten rock, as well as war to a minor degree. 

Although typically counted as part of the Morndinsamman, the two [[duergar]] deities had been banished by Moradin, making them members-in-exile (in contrast to the [[drow]] deities, who were no longer considered part of the [[Seldarine]] at all):
* [[Laduguer]], god of weapons-crafting, magic, and the duergar.
* [[Deep Duerra]], the daughter of Laduguer and goddess of conquest, expansion, and psionics.

Occasionally associated to the Morndinsamman, but also exiled from it, was the [[derro]] god [[Diirinka]], an intermediate god of magic, knowledge, and cruelty, as well as his mad twin brother, [[Diinkarazan]].<ref> He was considered to be the son of Moradin and Berronar; however, details are scarce.<ref>
