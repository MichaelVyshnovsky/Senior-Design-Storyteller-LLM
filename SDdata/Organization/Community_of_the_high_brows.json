        "mainbody": "he \"community of the high brows\" was a mountain giant tribe dwelling in the Orbrekh in the Orsraun Mountains of Turmish.\nThe community of the high brows was led by Oogle, its shaman, in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR. There were about 30 to 35 mountain giants in the tribe.\nThe giants wished only to be left alone in peace. Their relative peacefulness made the Orbrekh the safest part of the Orsrauns for travellers.\nThe mountain giants decimated the Onusclan orcs, who dwelt in the northern Orsrauns, whenever they crossed into the Orbrekh.\nThe community had an unknown relationship with the Emerald Enclave, which saw Enclave druids regularly visiting the tribe.\nCategoryGiant organizations\nCategoryOrganizations in the Orbrekh\nCategoryOrganizations in the Orsraun Mountains\nCategoryOrganizations in Turmish\nCategoryOrganizations in Interior Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\nCategoryTribes\n4d2hayytgnobm8v2b5gn3hbhqqw1r0u"
