The '''Broken Bone''' was a horde of [[Uruth Ukrypt]] [[orc]]s formed by the [[Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1024}}, the Broken Bone horde attacked [[Waterdeep]] in retaliation for defilement of the orcs' sacred [[Ukrypt]] crypt by a Waterdhavian adventuring company, the [[Dawnbringer Company]]. The horde aimed to destroy Waterdeep, but they were defeated with aid from a [[bronze dragon]], [[Lhammaruntosz]].
