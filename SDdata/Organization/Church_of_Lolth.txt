The '''church of Lolth''' was the primary religious organization dedicated to the [[drow]] [[goddess]] [[Lolth]], the Spider Queen. The church and its following first rose to prominence in [[-11500 DR]].<ref>

==Dogma==

The main principle of the church and its priestesses was to punish all who would disobey the word of [[Lolth]] and her faith.

{{Quote
|Love? What is love, or respect? Bah! Soft, useless feelings that none can lean on. Fear, now fear is as strong as steel, and can be leaned upon. I want to be feared.
|The words of a priestess of Lolth that became one of the creeds of Lolth's church.
}}

==Activities==

Priestesses would honor the Spider Queen by conducting rituals, leading sacrifices and spreading the faith. Sacrifices of surface [[elves]] would occur monthly, usually during a full moon as a direct insult to the elven deity [[Sehanine Moonbow]].

Other rituals included summoning [[yochlol]] to gather information or aid.

The church was heavily dominated by female drows, as only females could become priestesses in their society.<ref> and due to their authority, could punish those whom they wished in her name. Drow matriarchs would often work alongside the church to gain power and influence.

===Titles===

While ranks and titles differed in each community, the Church Of [[Lolth]] lacked official ranks and hierarchy. The most common titles, however, included the highly experienced Reverend Mothers and moderately experienced Reverend Daughter, with the rest referred to as Revered or Priestess.<ref>

==Shrines and Temples==

'''The Fane of Lolth'''; the largest temple that was dedicated to the worship of [[Lolth]]. Its walls were covered in webs, and sacrifices took place within while priestesses would communicate with the Spider Queen.
