Church of Eilistraee
The church of Lolth was the primary religious organization dedicated to the drow goddess Lolth, the Spider Queen. The church and its following first rose to prominence in -11500 DR.
The main principle of the church and its priestesses was to punish all who would disobey the word of Lolth and her faith.
Priestesses would honor the Spider Queen by conducting rituals, leading sacrifices and spreading the faith. Sacrifices of surface elves would occur monthly, usually during a full moon as a direct insult to the elven deity Sehanine Moonbow.
Other rituals included summoning yochlol to gather information or aid.
