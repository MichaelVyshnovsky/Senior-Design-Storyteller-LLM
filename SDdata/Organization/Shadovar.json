        "mainbody": "The Shadovar, sometimes pluralized as Shadovars, were the inhabitants of Thultanthar, also known as the City of Shade. before returning in the late 14 century DR and reestablishing a Netherese presence in Faerûn.\nThe term \"Shadovar\" meant \"of the shades\" in Loross.\nThe Shadovar had many skilled wizards and powerful sorcerers among their number, \n They held practitioners of the arcane arts in the highest regard, especially those that wielded the powers of shadow magic.\nThey used their arcane powers to scry the entirety of Faerûn, constantly examining and scrutinizing their new neighbors on the Prime Material plane.\nThey believed that Anauroch was their undisputed domain, and used their spells to keep the sandstorms of the desert at bay.\nThe Shadovar were a strong-willed people that tolerated no opposition to their ambitions. believing themselves destined for greatness and superior to the \"weak and worthless\" masses of the Realms. Conversely, Shadovar culture was seen as domineering and warlike by others.\nIt was the goal of many devoted Shadovar to undergo transformation into a shade, at the discretion of the Princes of Shade.\nAll Shadovar spoke the ancestral language of ancient Netheril, while some few learned the Common trade tongue of the Realms.\nMost Shadovar were forbidden from leaving Thultanthar without escort, save for the cases of military officers or the princes themselves.\nThe Shadovar dedicated the entirety of their society to the veneration of Shar, and relied exclusively upon her blessing over any other false deity. Worship of the Lady of Loss in Thultanthar had endured for over a millennia and a half, predating the enclaves entrance to the Plane of Shadow.\nWhile all Shadovar paid service to Shar, not all could be considered \"true believers\". Some merely used their faith as a means to achieve their own personal ambitions.\nTheir weapons and armaments were considered antiques, which was appropriate considering their centuries-long absence from Toril.\nWhen Telamont Tanthul moved Thultanthar to the Plane of Shadow, their mythal was infused with the power of the Shadow Weave and protected by the goddess Shar. After centuries in the Plane of Shadow, the ruling class of the City of Shade became twisted, dark, humanoid creatures referred to as shades.\nOn Hammer 1 of the , Thultanthar returned to the Realms above the Dire Wood,\nIn response to this growing opposition from the nation of Cormyr and organizations like the Harpers, and Helms Hold.\nThe Shadovar people began excavations across Anauroch and the Western Heartlands, looking for long-lost repositories of ancient Netherese lore or artifacts from the Empire of Magic. Over time, the Shadovar once again came to be known among others as Netherese, and the terms became largely interchangeable, even if not entirely accurate.\nIn the years following the return of Thultanthar, people from across the Heartlands whispered amongst themselves that one day the Shadovar would conquer Cormyr, the Silver Marches or the Dalelands, while being protected from the harsh Anauroch around them. These pessimistic folks prophesied the Anauroch desert would be overrun by terrible monsters, tyrannical wizards, and horrific undead.\n* Herzgo Alegni,  the tiefling that led the Shadovars search for the lost enclave of Xinlenal.\n* Maerandor, an agent of High Prince Telamont Tanthul."
