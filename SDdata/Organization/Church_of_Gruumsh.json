        "mainbody": "A clear example of the divide in religious practices regarded the matter of ritual eye removal. Orcs often attempted to prove their faith to Gruumsh by gouging out one of their eyes as a sacrifice to him.\n\n[[File:EyeofGruumsh.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An Eye of Gruumsh.]]\nGruumsh himself encouraged this practice, for indeed it was he who called for followers loyal enough to serve in his image.",
        "Dogma": "[[File:SmokyGruumsh.png|thumb|right|300px|Gruumsh appears in the smoke of a burning city as it's attacked by orcs.]]\nOrc society was based on the ideals of strength, survival, fear, and war, principles founded in the veneration of Gruumsh and taught to young orcs through cruel experience. Gruumsh, as it was said, made his children strong so that they could take what they needed from others, and such orcs saw the world as theirs for the taking.\n\nOn a personal level, Gruumsh demanded his followers to be strong and prepared to showcase their strength at any moment.{{Cite dragon/378/Domains in Eberron and the Forgotten Realms|34,36-37}} to earn his favor, Showing weakness would lead to death quickly and there was no place for cowardice when the orcs had yet to claim what belonged to them. Friendliness and peaceability were also intolerable, as Gruumsh had made the orcs to be violent and selfish for a reason, namely so that the weak wouldn't drag down the strong. When the world was ruled by orcs, there would be no place for the weak regardless. \n\nOn a wider scale, Gruumsh drove the orcs to follow his example by conquering their opposition. They were to crush their foes by any means necessary (despite Gruumsh's preference for straightforward brutality) and kill or enslave those that stood in their way. Never-ending war against their enemies was the desired state of affairs, and as such devotees of Gruumsh felt it was their duty to direct the orcish proclivity for war.\n\nThrough his mortal mediaries, Gruumsh drove his people to achieve their manifest destiny, acquiring new lands and living space. In partciular, Gruumans were to crush the [[dwarves]] and take their caves. \n\nYet Gruumsh believed in razing the lands of his foes, and chieftains were encouraged by priests to sack human cities. More than anything else however, Gruumsh sought the destruction of the elves. With them out of the way, orcish domination would be that much easier, and their lands and holds were to be destroyed.",
        "Activities": "Gruumsh's clergy were sure to maintain their physical fitness, and were responsible for culling the weak and unfit for fighting. This policy was applied regardless of age or status but within reason, orc toddlers for example being expected to fulfill their needs on their own quickly and hastily weaned so that they didn't weaken their mothers.\n\nGruuman priests also encouraged the orcish tendency towards warfare, becoming war-leaders or key advisors to them. Ineffectual or secular chieftains would find themselves undermined if they stood in the way of the goals of Gruumsh's clergy. They also acted as emissaries to the [[goblinoid]]s that often joined their hordes.",
        "Organization": {
            "Membership": {
                "Orc Subraces": "Although they acknowledged Gruumsh as the leader of the orc gods, [[gray orc]]s did not normally feel bound to worship him above any other members of pantheon. They worshiped the various orc deities equally, and normally selected the one that most closely aligned with their individual interests. Intertribal conflict was perpetuated by religious bigotry, since most members of a particular tribe tended to a favor a specific patron deity whose interests conflicted with the other orc gods. Even so, even orc tribes that held another god as their patron usually paid some homage to Gruumsh as the king of the pantheon.\n\nMountain orcs acknowledged the other orc gods, but considered them as little more than the servants of Gruumsh. Almost all [[mountain orc]] clerics were Gruumsh-worshipers, and as a whole religion was not an all-consuming matter for them. This also applied to orogs (orcs blessed by Luthic) who worshiped the whole orc pantheon, but Gruumsh and Luthic foremost, out of their respect for might alone and belief that the gods were mightiest. [[Orog|Deep orc]]s displayed this relatively secular worldview to an even greater degree. Though they retained the worship of Gruumsh when they descended into the Underdark, they had more or less forgotten the other members of the pantheon. Religion was still an established facet of their society, but the average deep orc was not interested in matters of the spirit and thought of clerics as little more than healers.\n\n[[Half-orc]]s that were raised in orc tribes normally followed Gruumsh. As a god of strength, action, and war, which half-orcs were skilled in and had a propensity towards, they found him an inspiring, if bloodthirsty patron, and related well to his teachings of hatred towards elves and dwarves since both of them often hated the half orcs in turn. However, even half-orcs barbarians and fighters might worship him as a war god even if not evil themselves. Those tired of explaining themselves or who wanted to avoid mistrust kept their religious stances private.\n\n[[Tanarukk]]s, orc-tanar'ri [[planetouched]], all revered Gruumsh, especially chieftains, who saw their demonic blood as a reward for their long service. They killed the weakest young of their tribes, as well as those among them who did not manifest tanarukk abilities, believing them to have committed a grave offense by rejecting Gruumsh's gifts. However, Ilneval was worshiped almost as Gruumsh's equal, and if they continued to expand the god of orc crossbreeds was likely to supplant the One-Eyed God in their eyes.",
                "Non-Orcs": "[[File:Ogre Tempest.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An [[ogre tempest]] of Gruumsh.]]\nThough orcs were his most fervent followers, Gruumsh had come to dominate a multitude of savage humanoids, which he unleashed against the civilized world. For example, during the Spellplague, trolls also worshiped Gruumsh, seeing Vaprak as their racial patron under him. Although an overwhelming majority of evil dragons worshiped [[Tiamat]], around 5% were devoted to different deities, with the more destructive, ravaging types favoring Gruumsh.\n\n[[Ogre]]s rarely practiced religion unless introduced to a deity by another race, even if said race was one they treated as enemies. Meetings between orcs and ogres were often violent, but when orcs won, they sometimes took the ogres captive and recognized their value in battle, treating them with surprising fairness before adopting them into the tribe and converting them into Gruumans. Most became barbarians, but a few were trained as \"tempests\", acting as a tribe's champion and mascot. Armed with an orc double axe and marked with armor bearing Gruumsh's symbol, the appearance of a tempest on the battlefield could strike terror in the enemy and rally shaken orcs."

            "Classes": {
                "Others": "[[Specialty priest]]s of Gruumsh could only be found in large clans, with half of his clergy consisting of shamans and witch-doctors. Shamans of Gruumsh, among other requirements, could never lose a personal battle, suffering instant death at their deity's hand if they did. The loss of the tribe in battle meant the loss in power of the shaman, which could be regained by successful conquest later on. Furthermore, they could never use curative spells on anyone but themselves. Despite this high price of office, orcish shamans were highly favored by Gruumsh in his effort to outdo other deities, and the rigors of shamanic status had some compensation. Firstly they were given extra favor that made them tougher than they would normally be, and second were trained extensively with weapons, making them as equally competent fighters as they were shamans.\n\nRare among orcs were [[war howler]]s, whose talent for inspiring bloodlust made them highly valuable. Though the orcish equivalents of [[bard]]s, these skilled fighters were taught by the clerics, and had memorized ancient chants of hatred against all other races, harnessing litanies that listed the many crimes of the enemy with such stirring delivery that others were driven to battle. Yet again, however, the internal conflict of orc society meant that few of them survived to be practiced warriors. Their obvious leadership skills made them prime rivals for a chief's supremacy, so only the greatest warlords had the confidence to field many.\n\nEvil [[ranger]]s of all races could become worshipers of He Who Watches."

        "Rituals": {
            "Confusion": "Despite these many consistencies, Gruuman orcs had a variety of conflicting messages about how Gruumsh was to be worshiped, and different tribes had their own superstitions about how to garner his favor or ward off his ire. For example, every civilization feared a chorus of orcish voices chanting his name outside of their settlements, yet he was reportedly not to be referred to by name among certain tribes by any but his own divine spell-casters, instead being called He-Who-Watches or He-Who-Never-Sleeps. Other beliefs an individual orc might hold were that a tribute of elf ears would bring his favor, that he should be avenged by the death of every elf they saw, that showing superior strength honored him, and that stomping one's foot three times and saying his name warded off bad magic.\n\n{{Fq\n| width  = 275px\n| source = A [[vistani]].{{Cite dragon/408/History Check: Corellon and Gruumsh|5-11}}\n| text   = Regardless of the original number of eyes their god possessed, orc shamans are required to remove one of their own — usually the left eye.

        "Bases": {
            "Shrines & Temples": "Gruumsh was to be worshiped within orcish lairs. Once orcs made camp somewhere, a war hearth would be lit, serving as a place for the celebration and feasting after victory and killing, and to represent the rage in the unblinking eye of their god. It was kept continually burning by the priests, and if the orcs moved camp then coals would be collected from the hearth and kept glowing in shells and pots until a new hearth was started. Adjacent to the main chamber was the war chief's residence, which housed a smaller fire in its center, and next to his enclosed sleeping area would be a shrine to Gruumsh consisting of a crude stone effigy surrounded by bloody offerings.\n\nSome temple or shrine to Gruumsh laid at the heart of almost every orcish community. These were oppressive places filled with acrid smoke and the stench of blood, and were essentially military camps with as many fighters and barbarians as clerics. The temples and larger shrines always had holding cells for sacrifices to be made, and many housed gladiatorial zones,<br/>",

            "Magic Items": "[[File:Sosh.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The Shield of the Severed Hand.]]\nShamans could so impress Gruumsh with their outstanding destructive tendencies that he rewarded them with a magical iron spear, a weapon granted to only a twentieth of the most powerful among them. They functioned as ''+4'' weapons when held (not thrown) by an orc shaman, were non-magical for all others, and burned elves that touched them, forcing them to be dropped.{{Cite dragon/141/Orcs Throw Spells, Too!|30}} \n\n[[File:Thrull.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The mighty orog warlord Thrull wielding the Hammer of Gruumsh.]]\nOnly worshipers of Gruumsh could use the power of ''[[Shield of the Severed Hand|Shields of the Severed Hand]]'', so called for the gory, dripping hand, its bloody marks and symbols always wet, emblazoned on their wooden surfaces. The shields allowed one to easily bat foes aside whether charging at them or blocking their strikes. Orcs favored the weapons for their shock value, and the first was made when an orc warrior chopped off an elf king's hand and mounted it on his shield, the shield having been found intact amongst the ashes of the same warrior's funeral pyre with the palm print still present.\n\nAnother artifact related to the faith was the so-called Hammer of Gruumsh, a ''+1'' [[maul]] engraved with abstract designs. The first to wield it was the orc king [[Gorak]] but many warlords had held it since, more recently [[Kursk One-Tusk]] and an [[orog]] named [[Thrull]] after him. The wielder of the Hammer could sunder objects with ease, and saw orc-blooded creatures bend more easily to their desires.",
            "Spells": "A number of [[spell]]s and prayers were unique to Gruuman priests:\n* ''[[Battle line]]''\n* ''[[Bloodspear]]''\n* ''[[Pocket cave]]''"

        "Relationships": "The [[Church of Ilneval]] was second only to that of Gruumsh, but observed token rites of obsceience as part of a calculated move by the Crafty Warrior. The [[Church of Bahgtru]] was largely subservient to that of Gruumsh as well, its members required to be absolutely loyal to tribe chieftains unless bested in combat. Gruumsh's clergy shared the job of culling the weak with the [[Church of Shargaas]].\n\nIf any orc could hate any elf more than was the norm, the clerics of Gruumsh did so in their utter loathing of Corellon's clerics. Not only would Gruuman disciples hunt down elves in their forest homes, but they'd launch suicidal attacks in the hopes of killing one servant of the elven god.<ref name=\"RotW116 />"
