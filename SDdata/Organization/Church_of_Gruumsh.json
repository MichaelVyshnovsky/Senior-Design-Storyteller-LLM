        "mainbody": "A clear example of the divide in religious practices regarded the matter of ritual eye removal. Orcs often attempted to prove their faith to Gruumsh by gouging out one of their eyes as a sacrifice to him.\nthumb|right|300px|An Eye of Gruumsh.\nGruumsh himself encouraged this practice, for indeed it was he who called for followers loyal enough to serve in his image.\nGruumsh was to be worshiped within orcish lairs. Once orcs made camp somewhere, a war hearth would be lit, serving as a place for the celebration and feasting after victory and killing, and to represent the rage in the unblinking eye of their god. It was kept continually burning by the priests, and if the orcs moved camp then coals would be collected from the hearth and kept glowing in shells and pots until a new hearth was started. Adjacent to the main chamber was the war chiefs residence, which housed a smaller fire in its center, and next to his enclosed sleeping area would be a shrine to Gruumsh consisting of a crude stone effigy surrounded by bloody offerings.\nSome temple or shrine to Gruumsh laid at the heart of almost every orcish community. These were oppressive places filled with acrid smoke and the stench of blood, and were essentially military camps with as many fighters and barbarians as clerics. The temples and larger shrines always had holding cells for sacrifices to be made, and many housed gladiatorial zones,\nRumors spoke of ruined temples of Gruumsh in the flooded forests north of Ylraphon.\nthumb|right|150px|A symbol of Gruumsh\nOrc war priests wore a patch over one eye to symbolize their worship of Gruumsh. They also dressed in dark red vestments, armored with war helms and black plate mail.\nVarious orc rituals had been contrived and lost over the years. An orc who subjected themselves to rituals involving Gruumshs judgement might undergo various effects. At times Gruumsh saw fit to grant a commune or raise dead spell and at others he deemed the orc unworthy and devoured their body and soul. Those he did find worthy might be rewarded with the Mark of Nishrek, imbuing them with the powers of the Hatred and Orc domains as well as causing a symbol (a broad diamond-shaped \"pupil\" with a slender, similarly shaped \"iris\" inside) to manifest as a burned scar on the forehead.\nBy bathing in the bubbling green blood of Gruumsh (usually found at unholy sites where clerics tended to iron cauldrons full of the ichor) it was possible for an orc to become Gruumsh-blooded. This caused the permanent shriveling and subsequent loss of the left eye, but empowered them with Gruumshs fury among other strange abilities. \nOther rituals used by Gruumans included the collection of raiding captives for a mass sacrifice to Gruumsh, the completion of which would summon an aspect of his to terrorize the nearby region, or an act of great destruction performed by a powerful priest to call forth an exarch. They might also utilize magic rituals made by other races, such as the method for creating plague walkers, as Gruuman clerics rarely cared if their troops got caught in the crossfire of their rancid bursts. \nthumb|right|225px|The Shield of the Severed Hand.\nShamans could so impress Gruumsh with their outstanding destructive tendencies that he rewarded them with a magical iron spear, a weapon granted to only a twentieth of the most powerful among them. They functioned as +4 weapons when held (not thrown) by an orc shaman, were non-magical for all others, and burned elves that touched them, forcing them to be dropped. \nthumb|left|225px|The mighty orog warlord Thrull wielding the Hammer of Gruumsh.\nOnly worshipers of Gruumsh could use the power of Shields of the Severed Hand, so called for the gory, dripping hand, its bloody marks and symbols always wet, emblazoned on their wooden surfaces. The shields allowed one to easily bat foes aside whether charging at them or blocking their strikes. Orcs favored the weapons for their shock value, and the first was made when an orc warrior chopped off an elf kings hand and mounted it on his shield, the shield having been found intact amongst the ashes of the same warriors funeral pyre with the palm print still present.\nAnother artifact related to the faith was the so-called Hammer of Gruumsh, a +1 maul engraved with abstract designs. The first to wield it was the orc king Gorak but many warlords had held it since, more recently Kursk One-Tusk and an orog named Thrull after him. The wielder of the Hammer could sunder objects with ease, and saw orc-blooded creatures bend more easily to their desires.\nA number of spells and prayers were unique to Gruuman priests\n* Battle line\n* Bloodspear\n* Pocket cave\nThe Church of Ilneval was second only to that of Gruumsh, but observed token rites of obsceience as part of a calculated move by the Crafty Warrior. The Church of Bahgtru was largely subservient to that of Gruumsh as well, its members required to be absolutely loyal to tribe chieftains unless bested in combat. Gruumshs clergy shared the job of culling the weak with the Church of Shargaas.\nIf any orc could hate any elf more than was the norm, the clerics of Gruumsh did so in their utter loathing of Corellons clerics. Not only would Gruuman disciples hunt down elves in their forest homes, but theyd launch suicidal attacks in the hopes of killing one servant of the elven god."
