The Zuros possessed a significant number of troops, granting the leader of the House the title of Blade Captain and the privilege to vote in a Blade Council.\nFollowing the \"white war\" of the , between city-states of Colletro and Sumbria, the Blade Captains of the Blade Kingdoms gathered in Sumbria or the annual Blade Council that involved all voting Princes and Blade Captains of the realm. During the council, Blade Captain Zuro passionately advocated for the use of smoke powder in military of the Kingdoms. This motion was brought times and times before, crating a point of contention between captains. Most notably, House Toporellos Orlando Toporello, who considered \"guns\" to be childish and unreliable. Blade Captain Zuros goal failed, even after sharing the young inventor Lorenzo Utrelli Da Lomartas advanced concept.\n* Blade Captain Zuro circa 1217 DR, the leader of House Zuro at the time, was not considered to be a competent soldier by his peers. His proclivities of collecting ancient knickknacks and being committed to his sizable ancient library gained him no respect among the militaristic Blade Captains. Blade Captain Zuro was a tall pompous man with white hair and white six-inches-long mustache."
