The '''Tchazzam''' ({{Pronounce|T CHAZ|um|refs=}}) clan was part of the huge pantheon of [[Nobility of Waterdeep|nobility]] in [[Waterdeep]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were known for being excellent [[archer]]s and hunters.

==Organization==
Lord [[Ulboth Tchazzam]] was the patriarch of the family from at least the {{YearlinkName|1357}},{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|8}} The designated heir was Ulboth's young brother [[Tarlon Tchazzam|Tarlon]] after Tarlon's older sister [[Carina Tchazzam|Carina]] was killed by some nefarious plot involving a family pet. As of 1372 DR, there were twenty-two living members of this noble family.

==Activities==
The Tchazzam family were mainly followers of [[Mielikki]], but were known to venerate allied gods as well. For example, they donated statues made from white [[marble]] to the [[House of the Moon]] that were displayed in the Narthex Cantoria.

As part of their expertise in archery and hunting, they also were expert bowyers and fletchers.

The [[Tchazzam Villa|walled villa]] they called home was located on the northeast corner of [[Diamond Street]] and [[Seawatch Street]] in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]]. It consisted of one- and two-story unique buildings surrounding a small green space. Directly across Diamond Street was [[Gournar's Tavern]] and the House of the Moon. Across Seawatch Street was the [[Wandering Wemic]] inn and their next-door neighbor on Seawatch Street was [[Dater's Inn]]. On the other side of the alley behind their property was [[Maerghoun's Inn]].

==History==
The Tchazzam family were of [[Tethyrian]] descent and achieved recognition as nobles in the {{YearlinkName|1149}}.

In [[Tarsakh]] of the {{YearlinkName|1222}}, Lord [[Ornigar Tchazzam]] was leading a hunting party from Waterdeep when they camped near the [[Starshadow Tower|ruined tower]] in [[Starshadow Vale]] near the southwestern border of the [[High Forest]]. There, he was possessed by the [[ghost]] of Lord [[Erthaer Javilarhhsson]], the Baron of [[Dauntylgar]], the noble who built the tower in the late 7{{th}} century DR. Under Erthaer's influence, Ornigar was obsessed with establishing a hold on the site of the ruins and he convinced several Watherdhavian noble families to invest in the project. A dozen young nobles and over a hundred hired hands returned to the site in autumn and quickly rebuilt Starshadow Tower with magical assistance. The new residents of the vale explored the environs and found barrows to plunder. Unfortunately, these were sacred to the [[Horned Lord]] and [[Tanglethorn]] tribes of [[orc]]s that lived in the High Forest. They mustered a horde and massacred the settlers in less than a [[tenday]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, Lord [[Corahk Tchazzam]], Ulboth's only son, left Waterdeep and did not return when expected. After some time, the family believed him to be dead, but in fact he spent years hunting in the [[Moonwoods]] and eventually joined the [[Harpers]]. He was last known to be living in a residence he purchased in [[Silverymoon]]. Because of the assumed death of his son, Ulboth named his sister Carina as the new heir.

In the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Carina Tchazzam was attacked and killed by her pet [[cat]]. Witnesses reported that it grew in size and its eyes glowed a bright green at the time of the attack. These telltale signs pointed to the beloved pet being transformed in to a [[beast of Xvim]]. Her younger brother, Tarlon, upon becoming the new heir to the family title, banned all cats from all properties they controlled.
