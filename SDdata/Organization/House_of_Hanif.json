        "mainbody": "he House of Hanif was the largest desert tribe of enlightened Al-Badia within the Haunted Lands around 1367 DR.\nThe tribe lived within the vast expanse of the Haunted Lands, controlling a region surrounding both the Ghost Mountains and Al-Akara Mountains. They maintained a permanent base a days ride west of Halwa in a qalat once held by holy slayers.\nThe House of Hanif sent an ambassador, Kerim bin Hanif, to represent them at the court of Huzuz. They were intensely loyal to the Grand Caliph, to the point where the other tribes of the Haunted Lands referred to them as the \"Grand Caliphs hunting dogs.\" Lost pilgrims en route to Huzuz were often rescued by the tribe.\nSheikh Kaldun bin Hanif ruled the tribe in 1367 DR. Their number swelled to around 10,000."
