        "History": "Clan Wilddragon was one of the dynasties that ruled Eskorn centuries before the [[Spellplague]]. This clan was very popular in legends and songs, and Eskorn was called the \"Wild Dragon Realm\" after it.\n\nIt was believed that Clan Wilddragon was totally exterminated  by a rival clan, although some sages and legends claimed that a few descendants of the clan still survived in the 15th century [[DR]], ignorant of their own lineages. Those surviving Wilddragons were accomplished adventurers and outlaws. According to legends, when the Wilddragons returned to the throne, Eskorn would become a prosperous land."
