House Duskmere was an elven noble house during the Time of Dragons.
The House was led by the Count of Duskmere.
House Duskmeres territories lay near the center of the domains of King Orchtrien of Dawnfire.
Although House Duskmere was supposedly loyal to King Orchtrien, they still plotted treason against him together with the Starfall and Vilirith houses.
House Duskmere was involved in a treasonous attempt to draw out soldiers of Orchtrien and slay them in . Claiming they needed aid to repel troll attacks, they drew a force led by one of the Kings deputies, the elven wizard Rhespen Ash. Rhespens forces were nearly routed, but they, and he personally, were saved by the arrival of Prince Bexendral, who teleported in and broke the rebel forces. In response to this treachery, King Orchtrien had the heirs of the three houses involved in the plot, the Starfall, Vilirith, and Duskmere, seized and brought to his home in Dawnfire for education and to serve as his hostages. House Duskmere sent as their hostage Winterflower Duskmere, the Counts daughter.
By , Winterflower Duskmere returned to them with a trove of copied spellbooks pilfered from Orchtrien. In response, the Count and his court took the house into hiding at a secret stronghold. This stronghold was eventually found and destroyed by King Orchtrien and his forces, leaving Winterflower Duskmere as the only survivor.
