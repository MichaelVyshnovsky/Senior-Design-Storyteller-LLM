The '''Sons of Green Hills''' was a once famed [[gnome|gnomish]] adventuring band led by [[Harl Jamison]] in the 9{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Led by Harl in defense of their homeland, the Sons of Green Hills slew many [[ogre]]s and [[goblin]]s who threatened the local communities. Even though Harl Jamison died of old age in the {{YearlinkName|845}}, the Sons of Green Hills were immortalized in gnomish folk ballads and tales, still remembered as of the late 13{{th}} century DR. Harl's final resting place, however, was robbed by [[human]] grave robbers ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|890}}.
