The '''Knights Kuldar''', also known as '''Barakmordanna''', was an holy order of knights that venerated [[the Triad]]. They operated throughout the realm of [[Tethyr]] in the 13{{th}} and 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==Organization==
The order was lead by a trio of holy warriors, one each from the [[Tyrran]], [[Tormtar]], and [[Ilmatari]] faiths.

==Activities==
They helped the Tethyrian people by offering aid and succor to those too weak or ill to provide of themselves. In some instances, they avenged those that fell victim to undeserved grievance and outright injustice.

==Base of Operations==
The Knights Kuldar were headquartered in the fortified monastery of [[Barakmordin]], situated on the [[Ithal Road]] between the cities of [[Saradush]] and [[Darromar]].

==Relationships==
They held loose bonds with the [[Janessar]], a valiant order of warriors in [[Calimshan]] that fought against slavers and slaving operations.

==History==
The Knights Kuldar were founded in the late 12{{th}} century DR, in the {{YearlinkName|1198}}.

During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, three knights of the order bravely sacrificed their lives to defend the [[Hospice of Saint Corin's]] from a horde of two-headed [[goblin]]s. The trio held out long enough until their brothers and sisters in battle from Barakmordin could arrive in reinforcement.

==Members==
It counted among its members, [[paladin]]s, [[cavalier]]s, and other holy warriors that dedicated themselves to the teachings of the Triad: the gods of [[Torm]], [[Tyr]], and [[Ilmater]].

===Notable Members===
* [[Tomas Trosbann]], Great Sword of [[Torm]].
* [[Gharek Minorson]], Holy Justice of [[Tyr]].
* [[Darrom Vallson]], [[Painbearer]] of [[Ilmater]].
