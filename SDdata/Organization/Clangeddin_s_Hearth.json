        "mainbody": "'''Clangeddin's Hearth''' was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] organization founded by the survivors of [[Clan Melairkyn]] and worshipers of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Organization": "Clangeddin's Hearth was created with a quest to take back holy sites of Clangeddin Silverbeard, which was part of the ancient home of Clan Melairkyn, lost to the drow, time, and dangers of Undermountain ''circa'' [[211 DR]].",
        "History": "Clangeddin's Hearth was established shortly before [[1369 DR]], and the dwarves started retaking the temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard in Undermountain following the disappearance of [[Halaster Blackcloak]] during [[Halaster's Higharvestide]]. Dwarves were not the only ones who seized the opportunity, as the [[drow]] led by the High Priestess of [[Lolth]], [[Azurna]], returned to Undermountain during the same time, building alliances with evil beings of the dungeon and plotting to destroy [[Waterdeep]] via the legendary ''[[Flame Sword of Lolth]]''. The artifact dated back to the [[War of the Seldarine]] and was staked from the Spider Queen and hidden in Undermountain.\n\nThe presence of the two old enemies brought on many conflicts between the factions. In [[1370 DR]], the drow were very close to reclaiming the powerful holy artifacts of Lolth and were on edge. They forced a [[kobold]] tribe out from the depths of Undermountain and positioned them close to the entrance to the dungeon in the sewers. There the dwarves of Clangeddin's Hearth attempted to flush the dangerous pests by flooding the tunnels. The dwarf [[Kolrathanin]] was responsible for the attempt, not knowing that the drow valued the kobolds as their eyes on the dungeon's entrance. Furious, Azurna sent her forces to slaughter the dwarves in the temple of Clangeddin Silverbeard. She entrusted the once more ruined temple to her [[lich]] ally who hated Clangeddin and his followers; in exchange for the temple, Azurna wanted the lich to find a hidden piece of a magical ''stone spider'' she needed to unlock the ''Flame Sword's'' power.\n\nMost members of Clangeddin's Hearth were raised as [[Morik Stormhand]]'s [[undead]] slaves, although at least one dwarf escaped the slaughter. [[Urkantor]] was locked away in the ancient prison of Clan Melairkyn that was occupied by the marauders of [[Horazak]], allied with Azurna. The orc leader planned on sending the dwarf to Azurna, per her demand, as her personal slave and entertainment. Urkantor was freed by the [[Khelbenite]] who was attempting to stop the drow plot against the City of Splendors.",
        "Members": "The few notable Clangeddin's Hearth members:\n* [[Daizez]], a dwarven historian, author of ''[[A Brief History of Undermountain]]'' who likely perished in the drow assault in 1370 DR.\n* [[Kolrathanin]], Clangeddin's Hearth's dwarf who attempted too flush  kobolds out of Undermountain's sewers in 1370 DR.\n* [[Urkantor]], a member of Clangeddin's Hearth who was captured by [[Horazak]] and was to be sent to [[Azurna]] as her concubine."
