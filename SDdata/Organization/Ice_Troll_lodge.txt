The '''Ice Troll lodge''' was a lodge of [[Rashemaar berserkers]] active within [[Rashemen]] as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Base of Operations==
The Ice Troll lodge was based in [[Mulsantir]]. [[Telthor]] [[badger]]s usually guarded an Ice Troll longhouse.

==Activities==
Berserkers from this lodge experimented with bizarre drafts and exposure to freezing weather in order to toughen up their skin, allowing them to ignore strikes that would harm lesser warriors.
