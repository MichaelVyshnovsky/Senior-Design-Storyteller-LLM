Bloodaxe Mercenary Company was a mercenary company based in Sundabar.
The Bloodaxe were very skilled and versatile, they adapted their tactics depending of the kind of job they would do. They accepted any kind of job, but preferred ones that involved killing humanoid. They charged 10 gold pieces per day for their services.
The Bloodaxe were founded by the dwarf adventurer Deldagg Huldgrym gathering many dwarves outcasts from Adbarrim around 1317 DR. Many of these initial members were criminals and blasphemers against Moradin. The vast majority of these dwarves died in various battles thought to be unwinnable against bandits, orcs (led by Eldoul), and overland raiders from Luskan. This led to human troops joining the ranks, mostly recruited from the Sword Coast (notably Baldurs Gate), the North, the Vilhon Reach, and Westgate.
After the death of Deldagg in 1331 DR, his second in command, the human fighter Velkor Minairr, was chosen as new leader, and maintained that capacity through the mid&ndash14 century DR.
The Bloodaxes remained a noteworthy mercenary company in the North through the late 15 century DR. By this time, they were no longer a predominantly dwarven group, but comprised outcasts and exiles of many species seeking to forge a new life with the group.
