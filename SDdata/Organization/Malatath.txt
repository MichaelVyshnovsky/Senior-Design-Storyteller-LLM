The Malatath was an undead army under the command of Khalitharius. They were active throughout Raurin.
As of the 4 century DR, before the duel between Khalitharius and Martek, upon the efreets arrival in Raurin, the Malatath were first stationed in the Cursed City of Stone, Medinat Muskawoon. They used it as a base to terrorize people far and wide.
When Marteks caravan came to confront Khalitharius, the Malatath slew one guard each night for three nights, never showing themselves. When the caravan decided to form a ring around Marteks tent during the night, the Malatath instead slew their camels during the night. The next morning, they destroyed half their water. Only then was Martek prepared to face the efreet in combat. But by the time Martek was victorious, the Malatath had slain all but one of his caravan. As a result of the battle between Martek and Khalitharius, magical fire covered what was left of Medinat Muskawoon and its surroundings for a score of years.
As of , the Malatath were stationed within the Hall of Kings in the Crypt of Badr Al-Mosak, from where they could strike anywhere within . Khalitharius led the Malatath against an army from the Airlancers of the Oasis of the White Palm, who were looking for the culprit behind the destruction of the Oasis of Akhir. Though the efreet fought personally, he also brought forth his undead, who pour out against the Airlancers. In his conversation with the adventurers who released the efreet, Sheik Kassim Arslan confided that forces had been sent north to fight against the efreet.
