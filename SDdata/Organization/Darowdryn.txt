It housed the merchant houses sizable mercenary and guard forces as well as house mages.
House Darowdryn was known to be an extremely private group of people. They all had light blond hair, so fare, it almost appeared white with age.
House Darowdryns matriarch was Ariskrit Darowdryn through the majority of the 14 century DR. Ariskrit was almost as old as the matriarch of House Matrell â€“ Hetta Matrell. Both women were friendly, and through the decades of knowing each other, they often could be seen together, discussing business and the noble politics of Arrabar. In the late-14 century DR, Ariskrits nephew Tharlgarl "Steelfists" Darowdryn was her companion and protector.
