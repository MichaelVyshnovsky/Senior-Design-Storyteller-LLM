'''Darowdryn''' was the oldest and and wealthiest merchant organization and a noble family from the city of [[Arrabar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. House Darowdryn was the richest noble house in all of [[Chondath]].

==Organization==
House Darowdryn was one of the oldest and most powerful merchant families of Arrabar. The oldest families held nine-tenth of the city's wealth while the younger merchant houses, such as [[House Matrell]], fought for the one-tenth share of the market. The mansion home of the Darowdryn family stood in the Living District of Arrabar that bordered the Governor's District. It housed the merchant house's sizable mercenary and guard forces as well as house mages.

House Darowdryn was known to be an extremely private group of people. They all had light blond hair, so fare, it almost appeared white with age.

==History==
House Darowdryn's matriarch was [[Ariskrit Darowdryn]] through the majority of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Ariskrit was almost as old as the matriarch of House Matrell â€“ [[Hetta Matrell]]. Both women were friendly, and through the decades of knowing each other, they often could be seen together, discussing business and the noble politics of Arrabar. In the late-14{{th}} century DR, Ariskrit's nephew [[Tharlgarl Darowdryn|Tharlgarl "Steelfists" Darowdryn]] was her companion and protector.
