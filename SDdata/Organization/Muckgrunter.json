        "mainbody": "he Muckgrunters were a group of trolls who dwelt in Forestfall Fen as of the late 15 century DR.\nOwing to the ideal conditions in the swampy Forestfall Fen, the Muckgrunter trolls were right at home. They clashed with the Queenstooth kobolds, intent on taking the territory around Throden that the kobolds were trying to defend. The trolls took advantage of their regenerative abilities to keep the fighting going almost constantly.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the trolls conflicts with the kobolds served as part of the escalation that awoke the bloodthirsty holdfast vines of Forestfall Fen. Not long after, adventurers from Waterdeep arrived in the swamp, and humbled the Muckgrunter leader, Knucklespine, on their way to investigate why the swamp was rapidly expanding."
