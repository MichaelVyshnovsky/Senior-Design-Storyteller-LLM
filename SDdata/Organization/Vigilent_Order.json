        "mainbody": "he Vigilent Order was a loosely organized society in Waterdeep dedicated to furthering the ends of the evil god Asmodeus.  In the years prior to 1480 DR, the Vigilent Order was nearly destroyed by the deva Jinnaoth IrGadohn who ruthlessly hunted down members of the Order.  Until the late 15th century DR, most members of the Order were poor, desperate people who hoped to improve their situation through Asmodeus power.  The Order began recruiting members of Waterdeeps nobility who wanted more wealth and power.  The Order was one of the groups attempting to complete the ritual of the First Flensing which would have created a gateway for Asmodeus to the Prime Material Plane.\nCategoryOrganizations in Waterdeep\nCategoryCults\nCategoryArticles needing page numbers\nCategoryOrganizations\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations in Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryEvil organizations\nCategoryOrganizations on the Sword Coast North\nbbxbac4kqoj4fg4ujg12hy0743vl7w9"
