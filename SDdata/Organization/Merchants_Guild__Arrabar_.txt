The '''Merchants Guild of Arrabar''' was the association of traders and merchants in the city of [[Arrabar]] in [[Chondath]].

==Organization==
The Merchants Guild was one of the major powers in Arrabar, the city ruled by commerce. The leader of the organization was the Guildmaster of Merchants. The guild considered itself to be an independent organization from both political leaders and clergies of Chondath.

==History==
''Circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the Merchants Guild was locked in a game of politics with the Lord of Arrabar [[Eles Wianar]]. The guild was fiercely fighting to retain its independence by electing their own successor to the title of the Guildmaster of Merchants, while Lord Wianar sought to install his son, claiming additional ruling power in the city.
