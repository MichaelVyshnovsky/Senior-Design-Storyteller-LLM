'''House Xorlarrin''' was a [[List of drow houses|drow house]] formerly of [[Menzoberranzan]].{{Cite digital book/Spinner of Lies|1412}}  It had been considered the "most magical" house of that city. The entire house relocated to [[Q'Xorlarrin]] in [[Gauntlgrym]] in [[1484 DR]].

==Citadel Xorlarrin==
House Xorlarrin was based in [[Spelltower Xorlarrin]], located on the plateau of [[Qu'ellarz'orl]]. A slender spire, the walls were striped in permanent and ever-shifting ''[[faerie fire]]'', with battlements set atop its high walls.<ref><ref>

==Members==
The house was famous for its [[wizard]]s, even giving the males status near to the females, meaning they were one of the few groups that did not fit the paradigm of drow males in Menzoberranzan. [[Matron Mother]] Zeerith would even listen to the men, as she relied more on advisors than other matriarchs. The wizards had more arcane power than any other house, and those who had no skill would not survive childhood.

After the [[Spellplague]], magic users of House Xorlarrin were known as "spellspinners" and utilized a different form of magic from those who practiced before the Spellplague.

==History==
===14th and 15th centuries DR===
By [[1372 DR]], House Xorlarrin was the fifth house. It was the primary assailant on [[House Agrach Dyrr]] after that house's betrayal of the city to the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] and [[duergar]] armies during the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]].

By the late 15th century [[DR]], Xorlarrin had reached the position of third house of Menzoberranzan.

===Q'Xorlarrin===
In [[1463 DR]], House Xorlarrin divined information from a private conversation between the brothers [[Jarlaxle]] and [[Gromph Baenre]] when the former was investigating the [[Dawn Titan]] ([[primordial]]) imprisoned in [[Gauntlgrym]]. However, with the appointment of [[Tiago Baenre]] to the expedition, it was understood that House Xorlarrin would be permitted by Matron [[Quenthel Baenre]] to form a new city, so long as it served the [[Lolth|Spider Queen]].

In [[1484 DR]], House Xorlarrin was finally permitted to leave Menzoberranzan and form a new city in Gauntlgrym called [[Q'Xorlarrin]], where they produced fine weapons at the Forge. They were obligated to trade with and pay tribute to Menzoberranzan and serve in House Baenre's army if called upon. In light of the house's departure, Quenthel Baenre restored [[House Do'Urden]] with a number of drow nobles (and later non-drow) and made it a member of the [[Ruling Council (Menzoberranzan)|Ruling Council]].

==Activities==
Slaves and soldiers of House Xolarrin mined [[Lustrum]], a rich mithral mine 20 miles from the [[Pillars of Woe]] in the direction of Menzoberranzan. It was abandoned by [[1372 DR]].

From [[1463 DR]] onward, House Xorlarrin possessed the Forge and much of Gauntlgrym, where they created fine weapons to export to Menzoberranzan.
