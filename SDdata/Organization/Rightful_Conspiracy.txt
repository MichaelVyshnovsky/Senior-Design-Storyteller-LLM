'''The Rightful Conspiracy''' was an initiative in the early 1370s [[DR]] amongst the nobility of [[Cormyr]] to overthrow Regent [[Alusair Obarskyr]] and assassinate [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]] so that a new king could ascend to the throne.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|364-366|22}}

==Organization==
The Conspiracy was chaotic and porous, largely lacking in organization, with numerous members working towards different goals and some even trying to murder the others. However, the early spring meeting was held at an island chosen for its defensible position, requiring the crossing of three guard posts and two bridges to reach it.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|325|20}}

==History==
In early spring of the {{yearlinkName|1373}}, a meeting was joined in [[Marsember]], where numerous merchants, local Marsembans, Cormyrean nobles, and even some [[Red Wizard]]s in disguise got together to discuss a future assassination of the ruling monarchy of Cormyr and its replacement by a different king.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|43-51|3}}

In the aftermath, the thief [[Narnra Shalace]] of [[Waterdeep]] was caught in the crossfire after accidentally following Elminster into Marsember, culminating in her being pursued for questioning afterwards.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|82-83|5}} She ultimately was hired by [[Caladnei]] to scout out a number of War Wizards who'd met with members of the Conspiracy.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|296|18}}

More activity related to the Rightful Conspiracy followed later that year, as evidence of Sembian and Amnian backing was discovered by the War Wizards.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|340-342|21}} Unfortunately for them, the magical backup they were expecting from the Red Wizards was thwarted by the sudden arrival of a flight of [[dragon]]s, which included [[Ammaratha Cyndusk]] and [[Aeglyl Dreadclaw]] among others.{{cite book/Elminster's Daughter/MMP|360-361|22}} During the fight, Queen Filfaeril's ''[[teleport gem]]'' was destroyed by a young scion of the [[Dracohorn]] family, preventing their escape. However, thanks to the help of [[Noumea Cardellith]], Filfaeril's Highknights endured long enough for [[Glarasteer Rhauligan]] to arrive with reinforcements.
