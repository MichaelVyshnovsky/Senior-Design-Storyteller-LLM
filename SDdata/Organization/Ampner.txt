The '''Ampners''' were a noble family from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were widely regarded as undistinguished among the aristocracy, and saw their moderate wealth wane during the early 1370s DR. They maintained a small troupe of servants, who doubled as guards, but were sure to employ three expertly skilled [[archer]]s at any given time.

There were rumors that the Ampners acted as fences for pirates who smuggled goods into the city docks.

Their family motto was "''Virtue never unrewarded''".

*[[Paige Hinton|Paige Hinton Ampner]], a Dame and wife of John Ampner, dead by the mid 14{{th}} century DR.

==Holdings==
Historically, the family's holdings were in farming, mills, and vineyards. They were known to have invested in wineries in the [[Dalelands]] and a glass bottling company in [[Tulbegh]]. as well as [[Marlgates]] and the [[Alambaler House]], which had been converted into apartment housing for residents of the [[Skymbles]] neighborhood.

==History==
After the passing of the house's former lord, Urgrave Raedrin, stewardship of the family's holdings passed down to the young Lord Noldron. While other members of House Ampner seemed to lose interest in the family business, amidst the loss of crops to blight in the 1360s DR, Noldron Ampner focused his attention on buying properties and shares of businesses within Ravens Bluff proper.
