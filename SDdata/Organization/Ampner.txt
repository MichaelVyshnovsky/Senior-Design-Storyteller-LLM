The Ampners were a noble family from the city of Ravens Bluff during the 14 century DR. They were widely regarded as undistinguished among the aristocracy, and saw their moderate wealth wane during the early 1370s DR. They maintained a small troupe of servants, who doubled as guards, but were sure to employ three expertly skilled archers at any given time.
There were rumors that the Ampners acted as fences for pirates who smuggled goods into the city docks.
Their family motto was "Virtue never unrewarded".
