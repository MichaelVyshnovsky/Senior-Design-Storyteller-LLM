The Dragonbloods were a criminal syndicate in Luskan in the late 15 century DR whose members were predominately Shou.
The Dragonbloods built a gangster empire centered around black market trade in unsavory goods, including drugs and slaves.
The gangs headquarters was the Dragons Lair, a reconstructed watch barracks on Blood Island. No strangers were allowed to approach without at least first relinquishing their weapons.
Their leader, Umbra, was rumored to be a dragon although in reality he was some sort of doppelganger. Each member of the gang had a dragon tattoo with older members having elaborate tattoos that covered most of their torsos.
