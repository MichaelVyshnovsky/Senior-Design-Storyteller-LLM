The '''Sacred Hexad''', or simply the '''Hexad''', was a collective term used for six nature-based [[deities]] of the [[humans]] and [[elves]]: [[Chauntea]], the Great Mother; [[Eldath]], the Quiet One; [[Mielikki]], the Forest Queen; and [[Silvanus]], the Forest Father, of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]], and [[Aerdrie Faenya]], Queen of the Avariel, and [[Rillifane Rallathil]], the Leaflord, of the [[Seldarine]].It is unknown how widespread or established faith in the Hexad is, as a whole rather than in the individual gods. It may be purely a personal faith of Lyra Sunrose and her mother.

==Dogma==
Followers of the Hexad believed, for one, that these gods made the forests of the world. For example, it was believed they created the great forest [[Cormanthor]], with Chauntea laying the beds of fertile black soil, Mielikki and Rillifane planting trees of all species and sizes, and Silvanus maintaining the woods like a gardener, while Aerdrie supplied sunshine, winds, rain, and thunderstorms to feed and strengthen the trees and Eldath caused them to bear flowers and fruit.

==Notable Worshipers==

| text   = My mother took a broader view. She worshiped the Sacred Hexad—my mother's term—of Rillifane Rallathil, the Great Mother Chauntea, Silvanus of the Wilderness, Mielikki, the Lady of the Forest, Eldath the Quiet One, and Aerdrie Faenya, goddess of the air. I still worship the Hexad today, fervently and passionately.}}
[[Lyra Sunrose]], a [[half-elf]] [[ranger]] of the elven village of [[Alyssim]] in the [[Tangled Trees]], worshiped the Hexad through the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], having picked up the faith from her mother. She noted "the Sacred Hexad" was her mother's term.
