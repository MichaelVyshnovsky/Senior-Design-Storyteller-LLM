The '''Council of Teziir''' was the leading body of government for the city of [[Teziir]]. 

==History==
The Council founded Teziir during the mid—14{{th}} century [[DR]] with the hopes of attracting caravans with cargo bound for the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. The proximity to their arch-rival [[Westgate]] made this task difficult, though they did enjoy a degree of success. In [[1359 DR]] the Council struck a deal with the [[Cormyrean Freesails]] where the Freesails would service Teziir's port once per week with a large [[cog]] for transport of caravan cargo. Caravans travelling to Teziir often were able to unload their goods onto a ship much faster than if they travelled to Westgate.

==Members==
[[Harvas Peltsen]] was one of the original founders of Teziir and member of the Council in 1359 DR.
