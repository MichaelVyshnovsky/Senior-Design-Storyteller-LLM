The Pelardh clan was one of the rich and powerful families that were members of the Onsruur (the council of lords) in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
This bloodline tended to be small in body with angular features and high energy. They liked fine dining and trying new, exotic dishes,  and frequently brought foreign cooks and foods to the Iron City for the family to enjoy. They were considered fair dealers and trustworthy business partners.
The Pelardh owned a number of metal decorating companies, offering embossing, engraving, chasing, and plating services.
This family was on good terms with many dwarves of the Deep Realm and bitter rivals of the Voaphangh clan.
