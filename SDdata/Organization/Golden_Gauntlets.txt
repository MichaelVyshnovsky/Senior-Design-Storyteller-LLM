The '''Golden Gauntlets''' were a group of [[adventurer]]s who operated ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Golden Gauntlets attended a party hosted by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]]. The occasion was King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]'s birthday, and Lord Thistle hoped to improve the standing of adventuring companies in Cormyr by having them present themselves as a gesture of fealty to the King.

After the festivities, it appeared that Lord Thistle had been murdered, but Ruben's word as a [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]] was sufficient for them to avoid immediate suspicion.

==Known Golden Gauntlets==
* [[Norrin Blackgrove]], a [[Thentia]]n [[bard]].
* [[Ruben Armand St. James II]], a [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]].
