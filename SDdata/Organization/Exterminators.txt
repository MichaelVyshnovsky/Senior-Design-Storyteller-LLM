}}The '''Exterminators''' were an adventuring company whose main purpose was to rid [[Huzuz]] of [[elemental vermin]], particularly the warehouses. The group was founded by a [[wind mage]] named [[Akil Festir]]

==Organization==
Rather lax by most adventuring company standards, the Exterminators did not have strict requirements for membership. Nearly anyone who wanted to join could get an appointment with Akil. The lack of discipline often resulted in different groups of Exterminators fighting each other over the right to kill vermin in order to claim the reward.

==Relationships==
The Exterminators also clashed with [[mamluk]]s and city guards on a regular basis. Their reputation outside of the [[Warehouse District of Huzuz]] was practically nonexistent.
