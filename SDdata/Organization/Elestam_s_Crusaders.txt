'''Elestam's Crusaders''' were an [[Adventurer|adventuring]] troupe based in [[Erlkazar]] in the [[Lands of Intrigue]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The group was led by [[Korox Morkann]], the duke of [[Elestam]]'s son, and included his four close friends.

==Activities==
When active, the group defended against assassination attempts and against [[vampire]]s and [[dragon]]s.

==Relationships==
Elestam's Crusaders were allied with the [[Emerald Brotherhood]], until that group's mysterious disappearance in the {{YearlinkName|1359}}.

==History==
The group was named for the Duchy of Elestam, which was the former name of Erlkazar, before it seceded from [[Tethyr]]. During the reign of then duke [[Valon Morkann]], the so-called [[Duke of Dusk]] from the neighboring duchy plotted with several counts and barons of Elestam to overthrow and assassinate Duke Morkann. The Crusaders were formed to defend the duke, and they successfully stopped no fewer than four attempts to murder Duke Morkann, though they never were able to link the assassination attempts definitively back to the Duke of Dusk.

After the chaos of the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]], the people of Elestam overcame the power of the rival counts and barons and asked the duke to rule as their king. When Elestam then severed ties with Tethyr and became the monarchy of Erlkazar, the Crusaders continued to defend the fledgling nation from evil within and without.

In {{Yearlink|1358}}, the [[goblin]]s of the [[Starrock]] tribe of the [[Kuldin Peaks]] and the [[High Peaks]] assaulted Erlkazar, in a seige of [[Duhlnarim]] that lasted for three months. Ultimately, the Crusaders formed an unexpected alliance with a group of [[ogre]] mercenaries from [[Rivenshield]] called the [[Shieldbreakers]].

The party disbanded in the {{YearlinkName|1366}}, when Korox succeeded his father as king of Erlkazar. The other four members were also promoted to positions as rulers of the other four baronies.

==Known Members==
* [[Korox Morkann]]
* [[Jivam Tammsel]]
* [[Purdun]] "the Firefist"
* [[Laxaella Bronshield]]
