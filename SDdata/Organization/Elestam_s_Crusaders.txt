Elestams Crusaders were an adventuring troupe based in Erlkazar in the Lands of Intrigue in the mid-14 century DR.
The group was led by Korox Morkann, the duke of Elestams son, and included his four close friends.
When active, the group defended against assassination attempts and against vampires and dragons.
Elestams Crusaders were allied with the Emerald Brotherhood, until that groups mysterious disappearance in the .
The group was named for the Duchy of Elestam, which was the former name of Erlkazar, before it seceded from Tethyr. During the reign of then duke Valon Morkann, the so-called Duke of Dusk from the neighboring duchy plotted with several counts and barons of Elestam to overthrow and assassinate Duke Morkann. The Crusaders were formed to defend the duke, and they successfully stopped no fewer than four attempts to murder Duke Morkann, though they never were able to link the assassination attempts definitively back to the Duke of Dusk.
After the chaos of the Ten Black Days of Eleint, the people of Elestam overcame the power of the rival counts and barons and asked the duke to rule as their king. When Elestam then severed ties with Tethyr and became the monarchy of Erlkazar, the Crusaders continued to defend the fledgling nation from evil within and without.
In , the goblins of the Starrock tribe of the Kuldin Peaks and the High Peaks assaulted Erlkazar, in a seige of Duhlnarim that lasted for three months. Ultimately, the Crusaders formed an unexpected alliance with a group of ogre mercenaries from Rivenshield called the Shieldbreakers.
The party disbanded in the , when Korox succeeded his father as king of Erlkazar. The other four members were also promoted to positions as rulers of the other four baronies.
