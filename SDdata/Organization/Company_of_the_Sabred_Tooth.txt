The '''Company of the Sabred Tooth''' was an adventuring company from [[Turmish]] that unwittingly caused the [[Reign of the Wyrm]] in [[1242 DR]].

==History==
After the [[Turmish War of 1220]] drained Lord [[Sjorn Sendreth]]'s coffers, he put a call out for adventurers and treasure hunters to be sent into the [[Orsraun Mountains]]. The treasure hunters were to find hidden treasures, but instead, they came across [[Anaglathos]] and his ancient horde in the {{YearlinkName|1242}}. The Company of the Sabred Tooth was one of the adventurers daring enough to venture into the mountains, guided by [[ranger]] [[Forier]] and his [[animal companion]] – [[wolf]] named [[Emerald (wolf)|Emerald]]. The band uncovered Anaglathos's lair and immediately went for the treasures. The [[blue dragon]] remained out of sight, and despite his first instinct to unleash his deadly lightning breath on the intruders, he decided to use trickery. The wyrm slew Emerald and took its shape, accompanying happy adventurers back to [[Alaghôn]] and magically ''[[charm]]ing'' the Company of the Sabred Tooth. As they passed through Turmishan settlements, the dragon used magic to enthrall leaders and his draconic might to scare folk into submission.

The Company of the Sabred Tooth was granted an audience with Lord Sendreth, hall with the immense wealth looted in the foray. Without wasting time, Anaglathos revealed his true form and swiftly disposed of the Lord of Turmish, claiming the title. The final fate of the Company of the Sabred Tooth was unknown; however it was unlikely they made it out of the Lord of Tumish's throne room.
