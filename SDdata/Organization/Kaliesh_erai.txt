The '''Kaliesh'erai''' was an organization of [[psionic]] [[elves]] based in the city of [[Evereska]] in the [[Western Heartlands]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionics Across the Land}}

==Activities==
The majority of the members spent their time in serene mediation and contemplation of their powers, but there were some who'd grown fascinated by [[psionic items]]. They sought to acquire any such items they could, and gladly bought or bartered them from visitors to Evereska. Thus Evereska was a good place to find a buyer for a psionic curiosity. The Kaliesh'erai were thus the most prolific collectors of psionic lore in the surface lands, and likely only second to the [[illithids]] in the [[Underdark]].

==Base of Operations==
The [[Hall of the Kaliesh'erai]] in Evereska was the headquarters of the organization. A subbasement area contained a number of laboratories and vaults holding the group's collection of psionic items. This represented the largest collection of psionic lore and knowledge in [[Faerûn]].

==History==
Thanks to their long elven life-spans, many members of the Kaliesh'erai had spent centuries training their minds and practicing their psychic powers, making them the top experts in psionic lore by [[1373 DR]].

However, in the mid-1370s DR, one young member, [[Reliath Crescentia]], robbed the Hall of a number of powerful items. The theft triggered huge debates among the remaining members, which came to focus on the future of the Kaliesh'erai and led to a schism between older conservative and younger expansionist elements.

==Organization==
The Kaliesh'erai was but a loose association of elves of similar interests but they had dissimilar views. While many simply contemplated and cultivated their powers, one faction was fascinated with psionic items instead.

By [[1374 DR]], the Kaliesh'erai had also undergone something of a schism into conservative and expansionist contingents, triggered by Crescentia's theft. The former, comprising older members led by [[Theldir Whitemoon]], preferred seclusion and separation from the outer, non-elven world. The latter, the younger elves following [[Dalthoeneir Delthoenoth]], desired contact with non-elven psionicists, and perhaps even allow them to join the Kaliesh'erai.

==Members==
The Kaliesh'erai only accepted [[elves]] or [[half-elves]] who could demonstrate some psionic capability and were knowledgeable in psionic lore or powers or skilled in autohypnosis.

Members were mostly [[psion]]s and [[wilder]]s. In [[1374 DR]], there were 55 members: 25 [[moon elves]], 15 [[sun elves]], 5 [[wood elves]], 2 [[wild elves]], 6 [[half-elves]], 1 [[avariel]], and 1 [[celadrin]]. None were [[evil]].

The organization required dues of a tithe (that is, 10%) of member's earnings. In return, members received psionic training and favored members enjoyed a 15% discount on services of a psionic nature from other members.

==Rumors==
The Hall of the Kaliesh'erai was rumored to contain cells holding imprisoned psionic monsters—such as [[couatl]], [[rakshasa]], or [[yuan-ti]]—that were being studied by the members.
