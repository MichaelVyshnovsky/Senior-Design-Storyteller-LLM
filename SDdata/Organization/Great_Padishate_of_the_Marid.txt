The '''Great Padishate of the Marid''', or the '''Marid Padishate''', was the collective term referring to the ruling body of government of the [[marid]]s.

Marids were less organized as an official government when compared to the [[djinn]], but their greater power ensured that they held greater control over the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] than the djinn did on the [[Elemental Plane of Air]].
 
==Organization==
The Great Padisha of the Marid, [[Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari]], ruled over all of the [[noble marid]]s comprising the Padishate.

Each and every marid claimed nobility of some sort, but only the truly noble marid served the Padisha and schemed to replace her one day.

==Base of Operations==
The [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]] on the Elemental Plane of Water served as the seat of power for the Marid Padishate.
