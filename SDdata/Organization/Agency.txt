The Agency was a mercenary adventuring company active in the early 1360s DR.
The Agency had a very unusual roster of members three elves, namely a blade bard, a bladesinger, and a wilderness ranger a tabaxi an aarakocra a cat hengeyokai a gnome priest with mechanical parts and a human militant wizard.
They were a former mercenary unit, and many of the members had worked with various mercenary companies, mainly the Mindulgulph Mercenary Company. For their experience with how mercenaries operated, a number of mercenary corps trusted them and hired them for special missions. They were considered to be almost a mercenary company themselves.
Before becoming the Agency, the original mercenary unit scuttled the Sea Jewel, a ship of the Wraith of the Inner Sea privateering company, which was on a contract with Turmish at the time. The dromond sunk with all crew lost.
