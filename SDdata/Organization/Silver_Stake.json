The organization was led by [[Karel Mahorne]], an elderly priestess of [[Mielikki]].\n\nMany of the Silver Stake's members were those who lost loved ones to lycanthropy and wanted to make a difference. These were mainly [[ranger]]s, [[fighter]]s, and [[cleric]]s, though membership was open to anyone of [[good]] alignment who shared the organization's goals. The clerics in the organization venerated Mielikki out of respect for Karel, but many actually worshiped [[Sel没ne]]. All members had at least one [[magic]]ally enhanced [[weapon]] and one [[silver]] weapon.",
