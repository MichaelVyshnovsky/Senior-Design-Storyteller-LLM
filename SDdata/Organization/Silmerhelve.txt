'''Silmerhelve''' ({{Pronounce|SIL|mur|helv|refs=}}) was a [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble family]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Base of Operations==
The [[Silmerhelve Villa|family's villa]] was located in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] of Waterdeep.

Their principal country estate, [[Helvenblade House]], was located near the northeastern edge of [[Kryptgarden Forest]], northwest of [[Westbridge]].<ref name="PotA-p32,34>

==Relationships==
The [[bronze dragon]] [[Nymmurh]] watched over the Silmerhelves using ''[[scrying]]'' [[magic]]. Another draconic friend of the family, the secretive bronze dragon [[Umsheryoth]], guarded Helvenblade House.

==Possessions==
One of several magical heirlooms held by the family was ''[[Nimoar's blazing bulwark]]'', a magical shield borne by [[Nimoar|Nimoar the Reaver]]. After Nimoar's death, the ''blazing bulwark'' came to the family, where it was passed down for generations.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}}{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 10}}

One of the greatest treasures of the family, gifted by Nymmurh, was a stormsword{{Cite dragon/250/Wyrms of the North: Nymmurh|81}} - a magical elven longsword capable of firing lightning bolts and protecting its wielder against lightning damage.{{Cite dragon annual/1997/The magic of Myth Drannor}}

==History==
The Silmerhelve family was ennobled in [[1259 DR]].

In the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the heir of the family, [[Laerlos Silmerhelve II]], rebelled against his parents' wishes and joined the [[Moonlight Men]], led by famed [[bard]] [[Mintiper Moonsilver]]. Laerlos II died in the [[Battle of Turnstone Pass]] against a horde of [[orc]]s. His death sent his parents into depression from which they never fully recovered. Several of the family's heirlooms were lost. The items were sought by the family and included the ''[[griffonlance of goring]]'', ''Nimoar's blazing bulwark'', and the ''[[silverhelm of the Guardian]]'', which was a [[relic]] of the god [[Helm]].

==Notable Members==

* [[Tannyth Silmerhelve]]: consort of Laerlos.
* [[Laerlos Silmerhelve II]]: the only son of Laerlos and Tannyth.
