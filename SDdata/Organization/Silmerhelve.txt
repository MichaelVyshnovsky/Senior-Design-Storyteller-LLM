Silmerhelve () was a noble family of Waterdeep in the 14 century DR.
The familys villa was located in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep.
Their principal country estate, Helvenblade House, was located near the northeastern edge of Kryptgarden Forest, northwest of Westbridge.
The bronze dragon Nymmurh watched over the Silmerhelves using scrying magic. Another draconic friend of the family, the secretive bronze dragon Umsheryoth, guarded Helvenblade House.
One of several magical heirlooms held by the family was Nimoars blazing bulwark, a magical shield borne by Nimoar the Reaver. After Nimoars death, the blazing bulwark came to the family, where it was passed down for generations.
One of the greatest treasures of the family, gifted by Nymmurh, was a stormsword - a magical elven longsword capable of firing lightning bolts and protecting its wielder against lightning damage.
The Silmerhelve family was ennobled in 1259 DR.
In the early 14 century DR, the heir of the family, Laerlos Silmerhelve II, rebelled against his parents wishes and joined the Moonlight Men, led by famed bard Mintiper Moonsilver. Laerlos II died in the Battle of Turnstone Pass against a horde of orcs. His death sent his parents into depression from which they never fully recovered. Several of the familys heirlooms were lost. The items were sought by the family and included the griffonlance of goring, Nimoars blazing bulwark, and the silverhelm of the Guardian, which was a relic of the god Helm.
