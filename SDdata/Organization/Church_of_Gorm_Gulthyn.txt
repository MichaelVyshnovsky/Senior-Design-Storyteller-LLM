The church of Gorm Gulthyn (
Gorms devoted were sworn to protect the Stout Folk from the hostile forces beyond their holds, and were never to waver in their duty to these sacred charges, remaining ever-alert and unceasingly vigilant so as to never be surprised. As every priest knew, they had to be willing to pay "Gorms greatest price" to ensure the lives of their charge, clan, and community, taking solace in the knowledge that their name would be remembered for generations.
Upon entering the church, each member was assigned a charge to protect and act as the bodyguard for higher ranked and more powerful veteran priests could choose their charges, often picking important clan members, but novice initiates were often given assignments at random. Such charges might be children, a childrearing parent of either sex, the elderly, or the otherwise infirm, and the foremost aim of any lesser priest was protecting their assigned charge.
They also instructed other local dwarves about the value of vigilance, and organized the communitys defense in the steady, reliable way Gorm had taught.

Gorms clergy typically wore red and black cloaks and helms, often marking their status with red and black armbands on their left and right arms respectively. Regardless of whether they were expecting to do some strenuous activity or simple ceremonies, they always wore the finest armor (in both metal and type) they could find under their clothes. They never removed all their armor unless in need of care of some kind. 
Similarly to their stance regarding their armor, Gormites never left all their weapons aside.
A number of spells were unique to Gormite priests or were closely associated with them
* Alert allies
* Blessed watchfulness
* Fire eyes of Gorm
* Iron vigil
* Sentry of Gorm
Gorm was well regarded by the dwarves for his unwavering commitment to their defense. Most saw him as stern, but they could not ignore his role in the survival of their remaining strongholds. He was well-regarded by human, halfling, and gnome followers of Helm, Arvoreen, and Gaerdal Ironhand, but dismissed as the traditionally dour dwarf by elves and other chaotically-inclined individuals.
Gorm, along with Haela Brightaxe, died in the Morndinsammans battle with the duergar deities Laduguer and Deep Duerra in 1383 DR, his divinity finally spent. After the Second Sundering, he was once again present and revered by the dwarves, but the exact circumstances of his return were unknown.
