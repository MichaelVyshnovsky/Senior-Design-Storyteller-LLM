The '''Ruwaldi''' were a tribe of [[Bedine]] people who lived in the desert of [[Anauroch]].

==Activities==
Unlike most other Bedine tribes that arranged their tents in a circular pattern, the Ruwaldi set theirs in rows, with the openings facing one another. They believed that this uniformity granted them greater safety from threats in the desert.

==History==
The Ruwaldi were one of the many Bedine tribes to band together at [[Elah'zad]] to confront the growing threat of the [[Zhentarim]] in the {{YearlinkName|1360}}. However, as the warrior camps of each of the tribes was separated from one another, they were vulnerable to attack. Zhent assassins utilized magical means to exploit this weakness and beheaded each of the Ruwaldi warriors in their sleep.
