The Niwa clan was the most powerful samurai family in Miyama Province in Kozakura in 1357 DR.
The Niwa controlled a large territory, and thanks to their allegiance with the Takenaka clan, their members were granted the position of shugo-daimyo, several shugodai positions, and many other jito positions on the largest shoen in Miyama.
