The '''Niwa clan''' was the most powerful [[samurai]] family in [[Miyama Province]] in [[Kozakura]] in [[1357 DR]].

The Niwa controlled a large territory, and thanks to their allegiance with the [[Takenaka clan]], their members were granted the position of [[shugo-daimyo]], several [[shugodai]] positions, and many other [[jito]] positions on the largest [[shoen]] in Miyama.
