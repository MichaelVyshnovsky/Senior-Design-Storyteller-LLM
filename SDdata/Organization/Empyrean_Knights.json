        "Organization": "The leader of all the knights in [[Stardeep]] was Commander [[Brathtar]] until {{yearlink|1375}}; the Commander answered only to the [[Keepers of the Cerulean Sign]], specifically, to the one in the Outer Bastion.",
        "Activities": "Empyrean knights defended Stardeep, followed the orders of the Keepers, and worked on training the next generations of Keepers.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Empyrean Knights had a number of facilities in the Outer Bastion of Stardeep.{{cite book/Stardeep|210-214|19}}",
        "History": "In {{yearlink|1375}}, the Empyrean Knights were sent to ride out and destroy a [[wood elf]] encampment close to the entrance of Stardeep by Keeper [[Telarian]], despite the misgivings of Commander Brathtar.{{cite book/Stardeep|92-93|9}}{{cite book/Stardeep|96-97|9}}{{cite book/Stardeep|100-101|9}} One survivor managed to escape;{{cite book/Stardeep|106|9}} the [[Masters of the Yuirwood]] called an attack on Stardeep afterwards,{{cite book/Stardeep|156-161|14}} which the Empyrean Knights were called upon to repel. Three star elves were slain in the attack.{{cite book/Stardeep|140-141|12}}\n\nWhen [[Kiril Duskmourn]] returned to Stardeep, some knights were sent out to collect her sword;{{cite book/Stardeep|144-149|12}} she refused, and Captain Brathtar directly contravened one of Keeper Telarian's orders. This drove Telarian to kill him, name a replacement, kill the replacement, and then use a trap to cast all the elves coming after him into the [[Underdungeon]].{{cite book/Stardeep|189-191|17}}\n\nDuring the ride across the Underdungeon, the Knights discovered a buried city ruin; there, they came into contact with the [[relic lich]], which sent out [[revived fossil]]s after them.{{cite book/Stardeep|229-239|21}} While fighting, they were found and joined by Kiril, who was also looking for them.{{cite book/Stardeep|257-258|23}} Kiril helped break the stalemate between the lich and Telarian, who had joined the company in their ride.\n{{cite book/Stardeep|263-264|25}} While they returned to Stardeep, the thief [[Gage]] began to follow them too.{{cite book/Stardeep|269-272|26}} He managed to knock one of them out and steal his clothes, right before [[Raidon Kane]] accessed a teleportation that sent many of them into [[Stardeep#Chamber of Observation|the Throat]] of Stardeep.{{cite book/Stardeep|283}}",
