The '''Mithertul''' family was a noble merchant family of the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]]. The head of the family sat on the [[High Council]] that governed Tantras.

In [[1358 DR]], shortly after the [[Time of Troubles]], the Mithertuls were allied with the [[Baraedin]], [[Onsil]], and [[Naskurl]] families.
