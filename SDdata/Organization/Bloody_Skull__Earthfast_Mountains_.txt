The '''Bloody Skull''' was an [[orc]] clan in the [[Earthfast Mountains]] in [[north Faerûn]].

==History==
In the mid-12th century [[DR]], the Bloody Skull were among an alliance of [[goblin]]s and orcs that were determined to annihilate the [[shield dwarf|dwarves]] of [[Earthfast]].

In the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]], while joining the [[Army of the Alliance]], the Earthfast dwarves discovered an orcish attack on them south of [[Uthmerg]] in the [[Great Dale]]. [[Alusair Obarskyr]] feared the Bloody Skull were responsible, but they turned out to be from [[Zhentil Keep]] instead.
