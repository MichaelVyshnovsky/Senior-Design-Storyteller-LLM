The '''Talendars''' were the oldest, proudest noble family in [[Sembia]]. Among their enemies are the [[Uskevren]] family. 

Their family home, [[Old High Hall]], was the biggest merchant-noble residence in [[Selgaunt]].

House Talendar dealt in fine furniture and frequently shipped to the kingdoms of the far southâ€”[[Amn]], [[Calimshan]], and [[Tethyr]], where the demand for [[walnut|Archendale walnut]] and Sembian mahogany seemed infinite.
