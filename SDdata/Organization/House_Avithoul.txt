'''House Avithoul''' was a powerful [[Lolthite]] [[drow]] house of the city of [[Sschindylryn]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were famed in the city for their great use of [[slavery]].{{DDO-time}}
{{Quote
|Matron [[Balbaste Avithoul|Balbaste]] of House Avithoul - You may take those captured in [[Cormyr]] for your slave pits. If you deem them too weak for even that, save their choicest parts for sacrifice to our Queen. Set aside a few strong ones as well. It is fit that we offer Lolth quality sacrifice in addition to quantity.
|High Priestess [[Hekta Szind]]'s missive
}}
==Activities==
Avithoul was renowned for the size and efficiency of their slave-gathering and training operations. The house was broadly responsible for handling the city's slave supply, which included both drow and captured surfacers, and made heavy use of special ''[[drow slave collar]]s'' that rendered even the most defiant slave pliable and useful.

==Headquarters==
The estate of House Avithoul was located outside of Sschindylryn across the chasm-bridges, resembling a prison and mansion in equal measure. While the slaves suffered in their pens, the house members enjoyed palatial riches nearby.The location of House Avithoul seems to match the location of the Slave Quarters depicted on the map included in ''[[Annihilation]]''.

==History==
{{Quote
|[[Jyr Dun'Robar]] - None equals House Avithoul when it comes to the slave trade. Let your warriors gather the slaves. But you may not keep them for yourself. These slaves are given unto Lolth, not your House. Avithoul will know how to use them best.
|High Priestess Hekta Szind's missive
}}
During the [[Darkening]] in the mid-1480s DR, Avithoul joined an alliance with [[Szind]] and [[Dun'Robar]] and took part in the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]], organized by High Priestess [[Hekta Szind]] to find the [[Thread of the Weave]] for [[Lolth]]. Matron [[Balbaste Avithoul|Balbaste]] sent her soldiers to aid in the [[Underdark]] and on the surface, and was able to take many prize slaves that were divvied up for interrogation, labor, and ritual sacrifice. They took part heavily in an operation at the [[Temple of Mystra (King's Forest)|Temple of Mystra]] in the [[King's Forest]], where [[Odezzt Avithoul|Odezzt]] and [[Phargred Avithoul|Phargred]] managed the troops and the huge number of slaves captured, while their ally [[Eldrin Szind]] interrogated [[Ana Brabener]].

Their profitable business proved to be their undoing, as during the invasion their long-time slave [[Mirini Elemys]] managed to escape her bondage and traveled to the surface. Thanks to Mirini's in-depth knowledge, she and [[Wizard of War]] [[Aptem Mews]] were able to organize a counterattack that struck Avithoul where it hurt mostâ€”by infiltrating a team of surfacers disguised as slaves into the Avithoul compound. They managed to kill the slave handlers, start a slave uprising, and went through the household slaying the defenders and destroying their prized treasures, including the skull of the revered [[Vaarrej Avithoul]]. By the time they were done, the house was in shambles and already casting accusations at their allies for causing such a disaster. This greatly weakened the drow alliance and opened the way for a strike team to enter the [[Temple of Lolth (Sschindylryn)|Temple of Lolth]] atop the city and strike at High Priestess Hekta Szind.

==Members==
By the time of the invasion of Eveningstar in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the house included the following notable drow:
* [[Balbaste Avithoul]], the house matron.
* [[Banister Avithoul]], a slavemaster.
* [[Magroph Avithoul]], a [[draegloth]] guard.
* [[Odezzt Avithoul]], a taskmaster.
* [[Orgallryd Avithoul]], a slavemaster.
* [[Phargred Avithoul]], a master slaver.
* [[Vaarrej Avithoul]], a revered ancestor.
* [[Ydrae Avithoul]], a soldier.

The house also included the following prominent agents:
* [[Amalzen]], the guard captain.
* [[Dolnozz]], [[Ophur]], and [[Ess'k]], slave handlers.
* [[Kal'anoth]], a wizard.
* [[Solul]], the slave overseer.
