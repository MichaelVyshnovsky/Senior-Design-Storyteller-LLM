'''Ancient Ax''' was a [[goblin]] tribe that dwelled in the [[Orsraun Mountains]] of [[Turmish]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==History==
By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the goblins of Ancient Ax lived in a constant state of war. The [[Onusclan]] of [[orc]]s under the rule of King [[Highstead]] launched occasional raids on Ancient Ax's territory, as well as the neighboring [[kobold]]s of the [[Tattered Cloth]]. However, the main bitter enemy of the goblin tribe were the much-hated [[dwarves]] of [[Ironfang Deep|Ironfang]]. The war was considered to be almost eternal by the 14{{th}} century, with endless campaigns and attacks both sides had initiated over the centuries. The animosity was stoked by Ancient Ax's desire to claim the dwarven city as their own; all attempts had been unsuccessful, possibly due to the kobolds' constant war against the Onusclan.
