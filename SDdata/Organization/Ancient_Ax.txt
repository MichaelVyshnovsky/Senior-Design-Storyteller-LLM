Ancient Ax was a goblin tribe that dwelled in the Orsraun Mountains of Turmish in the Vilhon Reach.
By the late 14 century DR, the goblins of Ancient Ax lived in a constant state of war. The Onusclan of orcs under the rule of King Highstead launched occasional raids on Ancient Axs territory, as well as the neighboring kobolds of the Tattered Cloth. However, the main bitter enemy of the goblin tribe were the much-hated dwarves of Ironfang. The war was considered to be almost eternal by the 14 century, with endless campaigns and attacks both sides had initiated over the centuries. The animosity was stoked by Ancient Axs desire to claim the dwarven city as their own all attempts had been unsuccessful, possibly due to the kobolds constant war against the Onusclan.
