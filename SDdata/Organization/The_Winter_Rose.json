        "mainbody": "The '''Winter Rose''' was an adventuring fellowship from [[Amn]], named after the beautiful winter flower – [[frostrose]], active ''circa'' [[1310 DR]].",
        "Activities": "The Winter Rose was assembled by a [[paladin]] who was guided by his unwavering commitment to justice and duty. The name was inspired by the resilience of a [[frostrose]] that kept its petals bright red against all odds and cold of the harsh northern winter. The Winter Rose proclaimed themselves to be defenders of the north.",
        "History": "The Winter Rose was established sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, when [[Sirge de La Sunya]] heard his father's, [[Don Di'Armos]]'s deathbed confession. The respected [[Watcher]] of [[Helm]] reveled to his son about a long-lost daughter, sired in the faraway land of [[Damara]]. The daughter's mother was a [[demon]] slain by Don Di'Armos after revealing her true nature to her paladin consort. Don could never find the will to kill his demonic child and left her with a secluded [[Monastery of the Yellow Rose]]. Shocked by the deathbed revelations, Sirge de La Sunya denounced his family, [[House de La Sunya]], and left [[Athkatla]] in search of his sister.\n\nSirge de La Sunya took on the alias of the Watcher and was joined by his squire, teacher, and best friend – [[Kepp Trapmaster]], an ex-[[Shadow Thieves|Shadow Thief]]. Later, by chance, the duo was joined by a [[half-elven]] [[druid]] [[Tianya]]. Eventually, the Winter Rose found Sirge's long-lost sister – a [[tiefling]] [[monk]] [[Naleen]]. The tiefling orphan joined the Winter Rose, not knowing that the group's leader, the Watcher, was her brother. The last two members of the group were [[Llendril Coe]] and [[Dalwynd Meadsbreath]]. Llendril was a [[moon elf]] descendant of the ancient citadel [[Hand of the Seldarine]], who sought reborn of her ancestral home. And Dalwynd was adventuring [[hin]] [[pie]] bandit who kept his friends' spirits up."
