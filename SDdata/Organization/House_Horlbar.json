Unable to flee her wraith, Entreri killed the matron mother.\nThe main source of income and power for the house was its lucrative agricultural work and its ambitious trading practices. They were not known for house warfare but were said to never forget a slight, sometimes taking generations to instigate their revenge.\n Ker Horlbar  Co-Matron Mother in 1361 DR.\n Jerlys Horlbar  Co-Matron Mother, killed by Artemis Entreri"
