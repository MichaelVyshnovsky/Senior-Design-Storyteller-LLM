The '''Zhentilar''' were the standing army of [[Zhentil Keep]].

==History==
The Zhentilar were formed sometime after the death of [[Zhentar]] in [[753 DR]] as a group loyal to his vision.  It was in response to the event in Zhentil Keep known as the [[Night Plague]] in [[882 DR]], that the group was expanded to form something similar to a an official army.  The Zhentilar continued to expand with the rapid growth of the Keep to become one of the largest militaries in the [[Moonsea]].  The Zhentilar were ultimately disbanded after the destruction of Zhentil Keep and the Zhentilar base of the [[Citadel of the Raven]] by the [[shadovar]] sometime between [[1376 DR]] and [[1479 DR]]<ref name=RoZK><ref name=FRCS4e>

==Organization==
The Zhentilar numbered around 22,000 soldiers plus an additional 16,000 mercenaries in [[1358 DR]]. Only about 5,000 troops were actually stationed within Zhentil Keep, with the rest garrisoned in the [[Citadel of the Raven]] and along the [[Long Road to Riches]].
