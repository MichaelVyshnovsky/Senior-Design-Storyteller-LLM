        "mainbody": "House DeVir was a drow house of Menzoberranzan.\nHouse DeVir was constructed among five floor-to-ceiling, hollow stalagmites in the midst of a mushroom grove on the plateau of Quellarzorl. The house was protected by gargoyles, traps, glyphs, and wards. Additionally, every fifth mushroom around the compound was a shrieker that would make loud noises when potential attackers approached.\nIn 1297 DR, House DeVir was the fourth house and planned to target the third house for destruction. In the plot, Matron Mother Ginafae DeVir used her clerical powers to aid a patrol of svirfneblin so that they would kill the wizard son of the third house. By doing so, Ginafae and her house lost the favor of Lolth. House DoUrden, the tenth house, took advantage of their vulnerable state and destroyed House DeVir.\nHowever, despite the apparent fall of the house, one noble lived on in the city Alton DeVir, a student at Sorcere who survived an attempted assassination by Gelroos Hunett, the \"Faceless One\" (so named because a terrible accident had scarred his face). Masoj Hunett, Gelrooss apprentice, killed Gelroos, and Alton DeVir scarred his face with acid in order to take over his identity. Altons secret was not discovered until nineteen years later, when Matron SiNafay Hunett came to speak with him and realized he was not her son. However, she continued the ruse, accepting Alton as part of House Hunett as part of that houses plots against House DoUrden. In the end, Alton was killed by his own wand of lightning when he attempted to take the life of Drizzt DoUrden in 1328 DR.\n* Ginafae DeVir Matron mother killed by Zaknafein DoUrden in 1297 DR.\n* Alton DeVir A survivor of House DeVirs fall who took over the identity of \"The Faceless One\" (Gelroos Hunett) he was killed by an exploding wand in 1328 DR during an attempt on Drizzt DoUrdens life.\n* Viconia DeVir Formerly a priestess of Lolth before coming to the surface and becoming a cleric of Shar.\n* Vizeran DeVir\ndeHaus DeVir\nCategoryHouses of Menzoberranzan\nCategoryDrow houses\nCategoryOrganizations on Quellarzorl\nCategoryOrganizations in Menzoberranzan\nCategoryOrganizations in the Northdark\nCategoryOrganizations in the Upperdark\nCategoryOrganizations in the Underdark\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\nCategoryLocations on Quellarzorl\nCategoryLocations in Menzoberranzan\nCategoryLocations in the Underdark\nCategoryLocations in the Northdark\nCategoryLocations in the Upperdark\nCategoryLocations on Toril\nCategoryLocations\nb7gukmyrxjq0fupe2ocvqt7cligej6d"
