        "Headquarters": "House DeVir was constructed among five floor-to-ceiling, hollow stalagmites in the midst of a mushroom grove on the plateau of [[Qu'ellarz'orl]]. The house was protected by [[gargoyle]]s, [[trap]]s, glyphs, and wards. Additionally, every fifth mushroom around the compound was a [[shrieker]] that would make loud noises when potential attackers approached.",
        "History": "In [[1297 DR]], House DeVir was the fourth house and planned to target the third house for destruction. In the plot, Matron Mother [[Ginafae DeVir]] used her [[cleric|clerical]] powers to aid a patrol of [[svirfneblin]] so that they would kill the [[wizard]] son of the third house. By doing so, Ginafae and her house lost the favor of [[Lolth]]. [[House Do'Urden]], the tenth house, took advantage of their vulnerable state and destroyed House DeVir.\n\nHowever, despite the apparent fall of the house, one noble lived on in the city: [[Alton DeVir]], a student at [[Sorcere]] who survived an attempted assassination by [[Gelroos Hun'ett]], the \"Faceless One\" (so named because a terrible accident had scarred his face). [[Masoj Hun'ett]], Gelroos's apprentice, killed Gelroos, and Alton DeVir scarred his face with acid in order to take over his identity. Alton's secret was not discovered until nineteen years later, when Matron [[SiNafay Hun'ett]] came to speak with him and realized he was not her son. However, she continued the ruse, accepting Alton as part of [[House Hun'ett]] as part of that house's plots against House Do'Urden. In the end, Alton was killed by his own wand of lightning when he attempted to take the life of [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] in [[1328 DR]].",
