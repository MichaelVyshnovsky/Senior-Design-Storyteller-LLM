House Uluuthin lost three of its scions in the 14 century DR after the family purchased a magical tome excavated from a tomb complex underneath the city of Jathrins Jump. The tombs were used as a temple of Talos, with an undead High Priest Aragath Taltar helming the worship. The book was Aragaths diary, and after getting the tome, Uluuthin house members spread word of Aragaths undead state sometime circa the . Mysteriously, three young lords of House Uluuthin perished while adventuring and Aragath felt cheated, unable to slay them himself.
