The '''Yakuza''' were a [[thieves' guild]] operating in the city of [[Bral]] on the [[Rock of Bral]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were led by Underbaron [[Ozamata Ku Murawa]].

==Organization==
They were highly organized and numbered around 40 members, but Ozamata could recruit up to 50 to 60 thugs and [[fighter]]s if needed. Members were all [[Shou]] [[human]]s native to Bral. They were marked by their [[tattoo]]s.

==Activities==
They engaged in extortion, racketeering, and gambling, and avoided any thing as basic as burglary or fighting for territory. Their goal was simply to maintain the status quo that they profited off of. They carefully watched all visitors to Shou-town.

==Tactics==
Members were [[thieves]] and [[fighter]]s skilled in gaming, gathering information, and intimidation, and were knowledgeable in Bralian history.

==Base of Operations==
The Yakuza ruled [[Shou-town (Bral)|Shou-town]] and controlled the Docks and much of the [[Bral/Low City|Low City]].

Their headquarters lay concealed within Shou-town. Originally a warehouse, and one of the oldest in Bral, it was converted to a boarding house, then abandoned, and finally reclaimed and renovated by the Yakuza. It still seemed to be a small and unremarkable warehouse, and so ramshackle it had a decided lean. Passers-by noticed nothing unusual, but it was well-secured with locked doors and many alert guards inside. It lay just off Dragon Street in Shou-town.<ref>

==Possessions==
They were armed with [[dagger]]s, [[club]]s, and [[crossbow]]s, and wore [[leather armor]] or [[studded leather]].

==Relationships==
Within Shou-town, the leaders of the Yakuza were well-known and readily obeyed by the people. No Shou within their domain would freely betray them.

Within the city's politics, the Yakuza were tolerant of the [[Temple of Ptah]] and [[giff]]; were neutral toward the [[Seekers]], [[mage]]s, and [[Arcane (race)|the Arcane]]; did not much like the [[Pragmatic Order of Thought]], the [[Tenth Pit]], the [[Juggler's Men]], and [[dwarves]]; and were enemies of the [[Halfling Thieves' Guild]], the [[Red Masks]], the [[Watchers]], and [[elves]].<ref name="RoB-p36>

==History==
The Yakuza were established by Ozamata when he first settled in Bral.<ref> They quickly took hold in Shou-town and fought vicious battles to expand their territory.

By the 1360s DR, they were still swelling in power and were plotting to force out the Halfling Thieves' Guild.
