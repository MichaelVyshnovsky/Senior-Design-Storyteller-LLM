The Hunters of Vengeance was an informal order of vigilantes and bounty hunters devoted to Hoar, the Doombringer.
The group did not have a specific base of operations, preferring instead to roam the Heartlands and north Faer√ªn to exact their justice.
Though few in number, the deeds of the Hunters of Vengeance were spoken of with great admiration, and a bit of dread, among the faithful of Hoar.
