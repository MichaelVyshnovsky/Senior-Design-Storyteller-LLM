'''Clan Karuck''' was a small group of [[ogrillon]]s that resided in the [[Underdark]] beneath the [[Spine of the World]].

==History==
In [[1372 DR]], [[Toogwik Tuk]] communicated with the clan leader, [[Grguch]], and brought the tribe to the surface.

During the campaign, they caused great damage to the [[Moonwood]] and also forced the [[elves]] themselves to retreat on a number of occasions. They used the elves' own tactics against them, as the elves believed the orcs were mindless creatures. Although Clan Karuck had forced two retreats, these were not definitive victories, as two [[pegasus]] riders watching movements on the forest floor and [[Tos'un Armgo]] aided their escape.

==Leadership==
The clan, as with most orcs, used shamans, with [[Hakuun]] being the chief advisor to Grguch.

==Abilities==
The clan were extremely resilient to assault and great tacticians, though whether this was thanks to Grguch or outside influences was unclear.
