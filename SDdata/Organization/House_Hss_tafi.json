        "mainbody": "'''House Hss'tafi''' was a tribe of [[yuan-ti]] distinguishable by their [[cobra]]-like hoods. Members of this tribe were called Hss'tafin.",
        "Base of Operations": "House Hss'tafi once resided on the northwest shores of the [[Lapal Sea]] in the [[Black Jungles]]. The entire tribe was magically transported from the jungles into the ruins of [[Ss'thar'tiss'ssun]] in the [[Forest of Wyrms]] in [[-320 DR]].",
        "Relationships": "House Hss'tafi viewed themselves as the most practical of the [[Yuan-ti dictionary|ha'srammass]]. They worked well under the [[naga]]s and other species, realizing that by doing so they could ultimately advance [[Sseth]]'s goals, and by default those of the yuan-ti, across [[Faer√ªn]]. This view led the other great yuan-ti tribes to view the Hss'tafin with distrust.",
        "History": "The Hss'tafin became part of the ruling class of [[Najara]], the Kingdom of Snakes, ever since their arrival in -320 DR. They held various roles including those of merchants, administrators, and religious leaders.\n\nHouse Hss'tafi played a critical role in rebuilding the ruined [[sarrukh]] city of Ss'thar'tiss'ssun during the reign of [[Terpenzi]]. The Hss'tafin were instrumental in reestablishing the rule of the [[nagara]] after Najara's fall which helped transform the kingdom into a major power in the [[Western Heartlands]].\n\nThe Hss'tafin were the first tribe of yuan-ti to develop the process for creating [[tainted one]]s and [[broodguard]]s."
