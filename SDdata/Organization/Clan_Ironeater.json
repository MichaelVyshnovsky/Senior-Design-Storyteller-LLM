        "mainbody": "lan Ironeater was a dwarven clan who spent centuries guarding some of the otherwise empty holds of Illefarn from intruders.\nWith the demise of Phalorm in 615 DR the demihuman defenders of that realm were no more. Casualties had been too high to possibly sustain the realm but the clan of dwarves known as the Ironeaters held on stubbornly to the area underneath Mount Illefarn for many centuries. Circa 1257 DR, Derval Ironeater, the king of the clan at the time, decided that their numbers were no longer sufficient to survive in those tunnels and ordered his clan to the surface where they integrated themselves into the populations of Daggerford, Secomber and Waterdeep\nIn 1354 DR, the elder of Dervals younger brothers, Korin Ironaxe, who always disagreed with Dervals decision to leave their home, took a force of 32 dwarves and gnomes to resume their anscestral duty after their youngest brother Derwin discovered an anvil, believed to be an altar to Moradin (though it was actually dedicated to Imix) - taking it as a sign that Moradin wanted them to reclaim their home. When they arrived though, they discovered part of the tunnel complex had been occupied by orcs.\nFor 3 years, Korin and his troop fought the orcs, losing nearly a dozen of their number.\nAdventurous militiamen from Daggerford helped Korin retake the tunnels from the orcs as well as a band of bandit necromancers. They also stemmed the flow of polluted water coming out of the Laughing Hollow.\nHowever, no more reinforcements from the clan went to aid Korin. Derval declared Korin and his followers beldarakin (treacherous creatures) Korin however, had declared himself \"King Korin Ironaxe of the Ironaxe clan, renaming his new realm Ironaxe Halls.\nAround 1485 DR, King Derval died suddenly from heartstop during a conversation.\nOne of the Clan Ironeaters family secrets were the recipes for their tattoos that were created with a certain mix of ink and metal. The tattoos beautiful color was reminiscent of liquid metal flowing like water. These tattoos were referred to as one of the Eight Great Wonders of Illefarn.\nDerval became a councilman in Daggerford and a well-respected member of the community. His clan built many of the stone buildings in town and ran Dervals Bright Blade, the larger of the two local smithies. While the rest of clan worked on construction projects and basic iron work, Derval claimed to make the best steel weapons from Waterdeep to Baldurs Gate."
