The '''Knights of Myth Drannor''' were a famous adventuring company of [[Faer√ªn]].

==History==
The Knights of Myth Drannor were formed in [[1348 DR]] by a group of [[Espar]]ran youths dreaming of grand adventures and better life than a provincial village could provide. They were [[Doust Sulwood]], a young [[cleric]] of [[Tymora]]; [[Florin Falconhand]], a [[ranger]] student of a renowned adventurer; [[Hawkstone]], the son of a retired [[Purple Dragon knight]]; [[Islif Lurelake]], a tough-as-nails [[warrior]]; [[Jhessail Silvertree]], a [[wizard]] with the Art blossoming inside of her; and [[Semoor Wolftooth]], a cleric of [[Lathander]]. The group was granted the charter by [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] after Florin Falconhand accidentally was involved in the [[Battle of Hunter's Hollow]] while escorting [[Narantha Crownsilver]], a Cormyrian noblewoman through the [[King's Forest]]. As a reward, the Crown granted Florin and his friends a charter allowing them to adventure. Moments after formation, Narantha requested to join the Knights of Myth Drannor (at the time known as the Swords of Eveningstar). King Azoun denied the request, but she was allowed to accompany the Knights on the mission to the [[Haunted Halls|Haunted Halls of Eveningstar]] without officially being written on the charter.

Some time after the fall of [[Myth Drannor]], [[Dove Falconhand]] (herself a former member of the Knights) decided to found a new knightly order with the same name.<ref>''[[Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide]]'', Ch. 5, "Knight of the Order" sidebar. The new order's charge was to maintain ties among all goodly people of the world in the service of defeating forces of evil. Dove vetted every new member herself, selecting for valor and honesty.
