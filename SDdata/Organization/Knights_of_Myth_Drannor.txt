The Knights of Myth Drannor were a famous adventuring company of Faer√ªn.
The Knights of Myth Drannor were formed in 1348 DR by a group of Esparran youths dreaming of grand adventures and better life than a provincial village could provide. They were Doust Sulwood, a young cleric of Tymora Florin Falconhand, a ranger student of a renowned adventurer Hawkstone, the son of a retired Purple Dragon knight Islif Lurelake, a tough-as-nails warrior Jhessail Silvertree, a wizard with the Art blossoming inside of her and Semoor Wolftooth, a cleric of Lathander. The group was granted the charter by Azoun Obarskyr IV after Florin Falconhand accidentally was involved in the Battle of Hunters Hollow while escorting Narantha Crownsilver, a Cormyrian noblewoman through the Kings Forest. As a reward, the Crown granted Florin and his friends a charter allowing them to adventure. Moments after formation, Narantha requested to join the Knights of Myth Drannor (at the time known as the Swords of Eveningstar). King Azoun denied the request, but she was allowed to accompany the Knights on the mission to the Haunted Halls of Eveningstar without officially being written on the charter.
Some time after the fall of Myth Drannor, Dove Falconhand (herself a former member of the Knights) decided to found a new knightly order with the same name.Sword Coast Adventurers Guide, Ch. 5, "Knight of the Order" sidebar. The new orders charge was to maintain ties among all goodly people of the world in the service of defeating forces of evil. Dove vetted every new member herself, selecting for valor and honesty.
