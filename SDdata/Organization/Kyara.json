        "Reputation": "Also according to Brother [[Twick]] (a knowledgeable [[halfling]] [[cleric]] of [[Chauntea]] who studied the marshes of Cormyr on behalf of the [[Naturalists' Guild]]), the hobgoblin tribes of the Vast Swamp were especially violent and xenophobic compared to their kin in other lands, assaulting all trespassers in their territory. There were several tribes who fought incessantly against each other. Most had enslaved goblins and [[kobold]]s to use as servants and fodder in battle.\n\nUnusually, these hobgoblins followed the mad god [[Cyric]]. They believed their conflicts would ultimately unite them under a single commander, who would then lead them in a unstoppable holy war against the human realms outside the swamp. They believed Cyric himself would arrive to lead their crusade, wielding a weapon so mighty that whole armies would flee at the sight of it and that it could cause castle walls to fall with but a touch."
