The '''Wing-ta''' was a monastic order based in the town of [[Goisho]] in [[Koryo]].

For many years, the Wing-ta monks tended a shrine outside Goisho, the centerpiece of which was the [[Hu'i Wing]], a massive magical brazier that revealed the future and was one of the most valued relics of Koryo. However, some ten generations before [[1357 DR]], [[Kozakura]]n forces stole the Hu'i Wing and carried it off to [[Karak]], and they built it into their fortress there.
