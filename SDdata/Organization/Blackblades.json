        "mainbody": "'''House Blackblades''' was a mercantile house that operated within the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Their business involved the shipping of goods in and out of the city, specializing in quick runs across [[Dragon Reach|the Reach]] to several several ports in [[Sembia]]. They were known for buying stakes in shipping vessels that regularly sailed the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].\n\nDespite the common misconception, the family had no involvement with any of the activities that centered around the [[Pirate Isles]], despite their numerous nearby holdings.",
        "Members": "As of the year [[1370 DR]], the family was led by [[Eldivvyr Blackblades]], who held a seat on the city's [[Merchant Council]]."
