        "mainbody": "ouse Blackblades was a mercantile house that operated within the city of Ravens Bluff during the 14 century DR. Their business involved the shipping of goods in and out of the city, specializing in quick runs across the Reach to several several ports in Sembia. They were known for buying stakes in shipping vessels that regularly sailed the Sea of Fallen Stars.\nDespite the common misconception, the family had no involvement with any of the activities that centered around the Pirate Isles, despite their numerous nearby holdings.\nAs of the year 1370 DR, the family was led by Eldivvyr Blackblades, who held a seat on the citys Merchant Council."
