        "mainbody": "The '''Shards''', or simply '''shards''', were a cadre of seven{{Cite dragon/353/Volo's Guide: Outsiders of the Forgotten Realms|68}} [[planetar]] servants of the goddess [[Selûne]] the Moonmaiden.{{cite book/Faiths and Avatars|135}}",
        "Description": "Each of the Shards was female and had long flowing blue hair and pearly white skin with shining aspect. They could display or dismiss their wings as they desired. It was told they were formed from equal parts moonlight and fire.",
        "Creation": "Selûne sometimes transformed favored [[petitioner]]s into shards as a reward for their faithful service in their mortal lives. The Shards were selected from among her highest-ranked priestesses.",
        "Activities": "[[File:Selûne vs Shar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Selûne and Shar battle, as two Shards fly overhead.'']]\nThe Shards were sent by the goddess to show her favor or presence or to give aid to mortals, such as by bestowing gifts or boons.\n\nThe Shards could be summoned by the [[church of Selûne]] in the sacred ritual of the [[Conjuring of the Second Moon]], conducted only during [[Shieldmeet]], which occurred every four years. This required a coordinated chant performed in every temple of Selûne in [[Faerûn]], and the confluence of the energy of this devotion summoned the Shards. The priests could have the Shards do their bidding, usually to battle the minions of Selûne's arch-nemesis and twin, [[Shar]], but only for a single night. However, at dawn, the Shards always took one mortal priestess to join their number before departing the world.{{cite book/Faiths and Avatars|136}}\n\nA few Shards would return to the [[material plane]] to visit old lovers, and children could be born from these unions. In some parts of [[Faerûn]] were [[aasimar]] and other supernatural bloodlines with ties to the Moonmaiden.\n\nA Shard guarded the [[House of the Lady]] temple in [[Immersea]], [[Cormyr]], around [[1358 DR]].<ref>",
        "Base": "The Shards dwelled at the [[Gates of the Moon]], the realm of the goddess Selûne.",
        "Magic": "The [[spell]] known as ''[[shard blessing aura]]'' was named for the Shards.",
        "Trivia": "The seven Shards were depicted in relief structures guarding the moon phase gates of [[Moonshadow Hall]] in [[Yhaunn]].\n\nOn occasions, Shar managed to corrupt some Shards, transforming them into [[Angel of decay|angels of decay]].{{Cite web enhancement/Vanrakdoom|24}}"
