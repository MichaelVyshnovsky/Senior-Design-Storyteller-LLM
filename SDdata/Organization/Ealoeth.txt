'''Ealoeth''' was an [[elven]] house of [[Myth Drannor|Cormanthor]].

==Livery==
The colors of House Ealoeth were sky blue, violet and rose. Their symbol was a two-addorsed pegasi volant, which lay on a sky blue field.

==History==
House Ealoeth was believed by the [[Srinshee]], to be young upstarts who would like to become part of anything as of {{yearlink|241}}.

They'd become slick manipulators with ties across the continent by the time of the Fall of [[Myth Drannor]].
