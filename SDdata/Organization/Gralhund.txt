==Organization==
The Gralhund family were of [[Tethyrian]] descent{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|9}} The tieflings were usually sent to a Gralhund estate in [[Yartar]].

==Activities==
In the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]], the Gralhunds were competing fiercely with [[House Amcathra]] in [[blade]]-making, producing higher-quality swords and selling them at a lower price. Amcathra's reputation as the best in blades was in jeopardy because the Gralhunds were using a new alloy of [[steel]] with traces of [[mithral]] they bartered from [[Thaglar's Foundry]], run by [[Clan Xundorn]] down in [[Skullport]].{{Cite dragon/172/Seeing the Sights in Skullport|15}}

In the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} the heads of the Gralhund family decided to ally with the [[Zhentarim]] in the search for the lost gold of [[Dagult Neverember]] under the promise of getting a fair share of the treasure. The Zhents, led by [[Urstul Floxin]], used Gralhund Villa as their headquarters while seeking out the [[Stone of Golorr]].

However, not fully trusting Urstul, Yalah also sent one of her personal servants, a [[nimblewright]] with a ''[[necklace of fireballs]]'', to search for the [[gnome]] [[Dalakhar]]. The successive blast and the death of Dalakhar ruined the alliance between the [[Zhent]]s and the Gralhunds.

When Urstul finally took possession of the Stone, he demanded explanations from Yalah about the nimblewright and her profiting from his injuries, and took the Stone. This triggered a fight between Gralhund guards and Zhentarim agents that cost many lives and was remembered as the [[Gralhund Villa Bloodbath]].

==Tactics==
[[Yalah Gralhund]] planned to use the intelligence resources of the Black Network in order to unveil some of the [[Masked Lord|Masked Lords of Waterdeep]] and blackmail or bribe her way into membership.

==Base of Operations==
The Gralhund family kept a villa in Waterdeep's [[North Ward of Waterdeep|North Ward]] between [[Saerdoun Street]] and [[Horn Street]] off of [[Pony Way]]. The villa grounds were enclosed by a {{SIAdj|12|foot|long=yes|adj=high}} stone wall with a main gate onto Horn Street. The entire compound was roughly wedge-shaped and was approximately {{SI|23000|sq ft|long=yes}} in total area. The main building was two stories tall and was approximately {{SI|13000|sq ft|long=yes}} total. A {{SIAdj|1580|sq ft|long=yes}}, single-story guard barracks adjoined the manor house, and there was a separate, single-story, {{SIAdj|2240|sq ft|long=yes}} stable that had an entrance onto Saerdoun Street.
