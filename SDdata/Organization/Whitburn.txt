The '''Whitburns''' were among several wealthy [[patriar]] families that composed the nobility of [[Baldur's Gate]], based out of the [[Whitburn Estate]] in the [[Temples District]], just west of the [[Lionsmoot]] and southwest of the [[Citadel Gate]].{{cite web| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220221195407/http://www.candlekeep.com/library/articles/sse/sse_1112-04.htm| title = So Saith Ed Nov â€“ Dec 2004| accessdate = 25-11-2021| date = 25-11-2021}}

==History==
By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Whitburn family controlled a profitable [[slate]] quarry, located just east of Baldur's Gate.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the city of Baldur's Gate was threatened by the encroaching army of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], flooding it with refugees from across the [[Western Heartlands]]. During that tumult, [[Pammella Nortale]] of [[Nortale's Hostel]] called in an old off-hand promise made by Lord [[Whit Whitburn|"Whit" Whitburn]] that he would make a donation to support the refugee hostel were he to come into money. Since the promise, Lord Whitburn had married a wealthy noble, so Pammella hoped to remind the patriar about the old promise via a letter. However, instead of money, Lord Whitburn only donated twenty-three pairs of male shoes.

The same year, [[Madeline Whitburn]] made a purchase at [[Bonecloak's Apothecary]] in the [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] through her butler, [[Blathers]]. They purchased ''[[Rigid-Quik Cordial]]'' to aid Lord Whitburn's problem of "stiffness", but Lady Whitburn dispensed double the recommended dose mixed in with a glass of [[sherry]] to absolutely no effect. Madeline mailed a complaint letter to the proprietors of Bonecloak's Apothecary demanding money back or an alternative [[potion]] to aid Lord Whitburn.
