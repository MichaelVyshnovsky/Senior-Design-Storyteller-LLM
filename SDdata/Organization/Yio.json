        "mainbody": "The '''Yio''' were a tiny [[magical]] race of people claimed to exist in [[Koryo]] in [[Kara-Tur]]. This was according to local legend in [[Tu Pe]] around [[1357 DR]], where they were said to live beneath the floating city there.\n\nSupposedly they rode on the backs of [[rat]]s and dwelled in hidden hives or nests. If they nested in one's house, then the homeowner was honored and would receive good luck. They also stole shiny things, such as [[bell]]s, keys, and [[ring]]s, so they were generally regarded as a nuisance. However, darker tales told of them attacking and killing people who disturbed their hives, and even of them kidnapping babies."
