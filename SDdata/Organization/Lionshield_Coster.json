In some instances the lion was colored blue, while in others it was emblazoned over a blue background.\nThe merchant company were able to ship finished goods, such as supplies of armor and weapons, to small settlements and towns all throughout the northwestern region of Faer√ªn.\nOne such settlement was the newly settled frontier town of Phandalin near the Triboar Trail and the Sword Mountains. The towns trading post was overseen by Linene Graywind. and a store called the Lions Share in Triboar, managed by Narth Tezrin and Alaestra Ulgar.\nSome time during the late 15 century, the trading post in Nightstone was sacked by a band of goblin led by Boss Hark after the town itself was devastated by a cloud giant. \nIn the , incoming shipments to the Phandalin post were not received, indicating that bandit activity in the area had seized the goods. Linene Graywind mistakenly believed these raids were caused by the Redbrands bandits and refused to sell them weapons. The missing shipments were actually caused by goblins from the Cragmaw tribe."
