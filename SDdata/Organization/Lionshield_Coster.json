        "mainbody": "The '''Lionshield Coster ''', also called the '''Lionshields''', was a merchant company based in the fortified city of [[Yartar]], that operated throughout the greater [[Dessarin Valley]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nThe merchant company's symbol was a image of a lion's head placed upon a [[wood]]en or metal [[shield]]. In some instances the lion was colored blue, while in others it was emblazoned over a blue background.",
        "Bases of Operation": "The merchant company were able to ship finished goods, such as supplies of [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s, to small settlements and towns all throughout the [[Northwest Faerûn|northwestern region of Faerûn]].\n\nOne such settlement was the newly settled frontier town of [[Phandalin]] near the [[Triboar Trail]] and the [[Sword Mountains]]. The town's [[Lionshield Coster (Phandalin)|trading post]] was overseen by [[Linene Graywind]]. and a store called the [[Lion's Share]] in [[Triboar]], managed by [[Narth Tezrin]] and [[Alaestra Ulgar]].",
        "History": "Some time during the late 15{{th}} century, the trading post in Nightstone was sacked by a band of [[goblin]] led by Boss [[Hark]] after the town itself was devastated by a [[cloud giant]]. \n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1491}},{{Phandelver-time}} incoming shipments to the [[Lionshield Coster (Phandalin)|Phandalin post]] were not received, indicating that bandit activity in the area had seized the goods. Linene Graywind mistakenly believed these raids were caused by the [[Redbrands]] bandits and refused to sell them weapons. The missing shipments were actually caused by goblins from the [[Cragmaw tribe]]."
