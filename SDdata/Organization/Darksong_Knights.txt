The '''Darksong Knights''' were an order of elite warriors dedicated to [[Eilistraee]], famed for their tireless hunting of the [[demon]]ic agents of [[Lolth]]. 

==Area of Operations==
The Darksong Knights were mostly active in, or under, the lands of ancient [[Ilythiir]] in [[south Faerûn]]. Following the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR]], they'd begun to roam further afield,

==History==
As of the 1490s [[DR]], post–[[Second Sundering]], the Darksong Knights were very much active, but existed only in small numbers.<ref>[https://twitter.com/TheEdVerse/status/776420658783723520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Ed Greenwood on Twitter]

==Members==
Around 1370 DR, the group comprised only [[crusader]]s and warrior-[[priest]]s of Eilistraee. At the time, all crusaders of Eilistraee were Darksong Knights, and these crusaders accounted for only 2% of the [[church of Eilistraee|clergy of Eilistraee]]. By [[1374 DR]], however, they were more simply classified as [[fighter]]s and [[cleric]]s. Members were largely female.

==Activities==
A Darksong Knight dedicated her or his life to spreading the ethos of Eilistraee, advancing her causes, and especially to slaying the [[yochlol]], the demons who served as the handmaidens of Lolth.

==Abilities==
Utilizing a complex and dance-like style of sword-fighting, a trained Darksong Knight in battle was far more mobile and deceptive than other fighters. They could apply their skills in dance to making feints, to evade opportunistic attacks, and to attack with ease while moving. They were less resilient than a comparable fighter, however.

As the prey of the Darksong Knights were the demonic servants of Lolth, they honed their skills to expose, hunt down, and fight yochlol, and to kill them.

==Notable Darksong Knights==
