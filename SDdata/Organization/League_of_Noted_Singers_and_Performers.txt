The '''League of Noted Singers and Performers''' was a famous guild of performers that operated throughout ancient [[Netheril]].

==Organization==
The guild was made up of actors, singers, artists, mimes, and puppeteers who contributed to performing theatrical plays.

==Activities==
The League was the second-most popular band of performers in Netheril behind the [[Singers and Thespians Guild of Opus]]. However, the League was exceptionally hard-working and performed more tours, resulting in far more people seeing their plays. They used the works of playwrights that included [[Alamos]] (tragedies), [[Alciati]] (heroic loners), and [[Greengreve]] (dramatic adventures). In the final years before [[Karsus's Folly]] they shied away from plays that could be interpreted as being subversive or critical of Netheril, and tried to stay in business by being politically neutral.

==Base of Operations==
The League's base was near the center of [[Eileanar]] [[enclave]], in the shadow of [[Karsus Castle]].
