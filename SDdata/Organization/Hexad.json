        "mainbody": "he Sacred Hexad, or simply the Hexad, was a collective term used for six nature-based deities of the humans and elves Chauntea, the Great Mother Eldath, the Quiet One Mielikki, the Forest Queen and Silvanus, the Forest Father, of the Faer√ªnian pantheon, and Aerdrie Faenya, Queen of the Avariel, and Rillifane Rallathil, the Leaflord, of the Seldarine.It is unknown how widespread or established faith in the Hexad is, as a whole rather than in the individual gods. It may be purely a personal faith of Lyra Sunrose and her mother.\nFollowers of the Hexad believed, for one, that these gods made the forests of the world. For example, it was believed they created the great forest Cormanthor, with Chauntea laying the beds of fertile black soil, Mielikki and Rillifane planting trees of all species and sizes, and Silvanus maintaining the woods like a gardener, while Aerdrie supplied sunshine, winds, rain, and thunderstorms to feed and strengthen the trees and Eldath caused them to bear flowers and fruit.\nLyra Sunrose, a half-elf ranger of the elven village of Alyssim in the Tangled Trees, worshiped the Hexad through the 14 century DR, having picked up the faith from her mother. She noted \"the Sacred Hexad\" was her mothers term."
