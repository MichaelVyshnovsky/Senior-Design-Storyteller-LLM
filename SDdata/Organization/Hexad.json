For example, it was believed they created the great forest [[Cormanthor]], with Chauntea laying the beds of fertile black soil, Mielikki and Rillifane planting trees of all species and sizes, and Silvanus maintaining the woods like a gardener, while Aerdrie supplied sunshine, winds, rain, and thunderstorms to feed and strengthen the trees and Eldath caused them to bear flowers and fruit.",
