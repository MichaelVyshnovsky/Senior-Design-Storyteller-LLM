House Silverspear was a relatively small moon elf house on Evermeet.
Many of its members become priests or wizards. The house estate was located in Leuthilspar on the island of Evermeet, and unlike most structures in the city, its buildings were constructed via non-magical means. The estate was a mix of architectural styles.
The house colors were silver and green.
