'''House Silverspear''' was a relatively small [[moon elf]] house on [[Evermeet]].

Many of its members become [[priest]]s or [[wizard]]s. The house estate was located in [[Leuthilspar]] on the island of Evermeet, and unlike most structures in the city, its buildings were constructed via non-magical means. The estate was a mix of architectural styles.

The house colors were silver and green.
