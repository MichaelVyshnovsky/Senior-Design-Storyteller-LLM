        "mainbody": "The Harvestshield Reapers were a small army of flesh golems created to protect the farmlands around Harvestshield Mountain. As of the late 15 century DR, they could no longer be controlled and regarded everything as an enemy.\nThe Reapers were created by one of several wizard from Chaunteas Citadel to help fight raiders, and were complemented by a group of stone golems known as the Heartcoil Guardians who defended the Citadel against threats from the Underdark.\nUnfortunately, the Reapers were no match for the red dragon Argathakul when it attacked the area. Those Reapers that survived went on to become battered and worn down. By the late 15 century DR, they had been fighting alone for so long that they no longer even recognized the power of Chauntea over them. When Mrolgyets Legion occupied the area, they were unable to recognize them as the enemy over the Lords Alliance despite efforts by adventurers to recruit or gain control over them."
