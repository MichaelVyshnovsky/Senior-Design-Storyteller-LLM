        "mainbody": "The '''Harvestshield Reapers''' were a small army of [[flesh golem]]s created to protect the farmlands around [[Harvestshield Mountain]]. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], they could no longer be controlled and regarded everything as an enemy.",
        "History": "The Reapers were created by one of several [[wizard]] from [[Chauntea's Citadel]] to help fight raiders, and were complemented by a group of [[stone golem]]s known as the [[Heartcoil Guardians]] who defended the Citadel against threats from the [[Underdark]].\n\nUnfortunately, the Reapers were no match for the [[red dragon]] [[Argathakul]] when it attacked the area. Those Reapers that survived went on to become battered and worn down. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, they had been fighting alone for so long that they no longer even recognized the power of [[Chauntea]] over them. When [[Mrolgyet's Legion]] occupied the area, they were unable to recognize them as the enemy over the [[Lords' Alliance]] despite efforts by [[adventurer]]s to recruit or gain control over them."
