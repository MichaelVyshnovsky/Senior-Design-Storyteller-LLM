        "mainbody": "The '''Mandible''' was the most powerful gang operating in [[Skullport]] in the late 15th century DR. Next to the [[Skulls of Skullport]] The Mandible was the closest thing to a government the town had.  The gang took its name from a sword known as ''[[Dragon's Tooth]]'' which was found in the ruins of the old town.  The sword served as a badge of office for the gang's leader and, since gang members bickered frequently amongst themselves, possession of the sword changed hands often.",
