Next to the Skulls of Skullport The Mandible was the closest thing to a government the town had.  The gang took its name from a sword known as Dragons Tooth which was found in the ruins of the old town.  The sword served as a badge of office for the gangs leader and, since gang members bickered frequently amongst themselves, possession of the sword changed hands often.\nCategoryCriminal organizations\nCategoryOrganizations in Skullport\nCategoryOrganizations in Undermountain\nCategoryOrganizations in the Underdark\nCategoryOrganizations in Waterdeep\nCategoryOrganizations on the Sword Coast North\nCategoryOrganizations in Northwest Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\nik070mz96pfv5j7znfzrb5b2us75j7z"
