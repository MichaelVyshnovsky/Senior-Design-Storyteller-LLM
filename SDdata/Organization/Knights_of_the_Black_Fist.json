        "mainbody": "The Knights of the Black Fist, that originated as the Brothers of the Black Fist, was the military force that dutifully served the city-state of Phlan during the late 14 and 15 centuries DR. the Black Fist maintained tenuous connections with the faith of Bane that waned as the fighting force shifted its alignment to that of Phlan as a political power of the Moonsea.\nWhile the soldiers of the Black Fist served as the military force of Phlan, the Black Watch militia served as its primary law enforcement group within the city, having held those duties for many decades. During times of internal strife however, the Knights of the Black Fist began to patrol the city streets themselves, enacting marshal law and forming an oppressive feeling of dread among the citizens of Phlan.\nIn the years following their formation the knights were seen as stalwart defenders against the encroaching threat of the returned Netherese Empire. As strong leadership in Phlan waned over the years, the knights earned a reputation for corrupt practices and resorted to using brute force against the citys own citizens, turned to crime themselves, and some even eschewed their loyalty to the city itself.\nDuring their early years in the 14 century DR, the Brotherhood of the Black Fist operated from the Citadel of the Raven in the northern slopes of the Dragonspine Mountains.\nAfter the groups transformation into a the state-sponsored knighthood of Phlan,\nmaintained forces at Sokol Keep to watch over the sea fortress lighthouse,\nThe Vilhon Mercenary Corps were formed by Lord Caleb Randol in direct response to the power the Black Fist held under the direction of the Lord Protector.\nThe Brothers of the Black Fist was formed an elite fighting force following the death of Bane during the Time of Troubles, and was still in its infancy as of the .\nAfter the unexpected death of Lord Protector Anivar in a construction accident in Valjevo Castle,\nAs the reborn Cult of the Dragon became entangled within Phlan during the 1480s DR, and a series of thefts and kidnappings broke out throughout the city the Black Fist started to become overwhelmed with maintaining order in the city. While some knights of the order left their comrades and turned to banditry, others were forced to stand against the citizens of Phlan as riots erupted throughout Podol Plaza. It was even revealed that some in the city orchestrated an unsuccessful plot to assassinate Lord Regent Ector Brahms.\nThe conflict in the came to a head when the green dragon Vorgansharax swooped down on Castle Valjevo castle and wrought destruction down on Phlan. Schisms within the Black Fist became evident when some of their order began slaying Phlans citizens where they stood, their armor marked with splotches of green paint. Nearly half their number proved themselves to be traitors, forming their own group known as the Tears of Virulence, loyal to the cult and its green wyrm patron.\nLord Regent Brahms survived the initial assault thanks to the efforts of Knight Aleyd Burral, but was later slain."
