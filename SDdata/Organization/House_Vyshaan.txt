'''House Vyshaan''', or simply the '''Vyshaanti''', were a clan of extremely power-hungry [[sun elves]] who came to power in ancient [[Aryvandaar]].

==History==
After a time, they became corrupt and learned malignant forms of [[magic]] from [[devil]]s, which gave them arcane might.

In {{Yearlink|-10900}}, they gained a secret patron in the fallen [[solar]], [[Malkizid]]. They conspired with Malkizid to learn powerful rituals of [[mythal]]-craft that hadn't been matched since. They were also the first to use mythal-craft in war. They built crystal citadels on some of the lower planes for their use when they were visiting. Their clans also created some of the best armor and war weapons, including some of the first elven war [[golem]]s. One of the final acts of House Vyshaan was to make the [[Waymeet]], which was originally developed as a war machine.
