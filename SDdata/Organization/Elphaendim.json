Thalammose's favorite scion was his great-niece [[Cauvra Elphaendim]]. The young girl was still a few years away from her sixteenth birthday celebration in [[1373 DR]], and the patriarch felt protective of his great-niece. The Old Elf took to mentoring Cauvra as he saw burgeoning [[wizard]]ly skills in the young woman. Another famous family member was [[Brastynbold Elphaendim]]. A boisterous bear of a man with many stories of his brawls and feats of strength circulating the noble circles Arrabar.\n\nElphaendim family attended [[Emriana Matrell]]'s grand sixteenth birthday celebration at the [[Matrell]] estate on [[Tarsakh 13]] of the {{YearlinkName|1362}}. Young Emriana was childhood friends with Cauvra, but they drifted apart as Cauvra's tutoring in ''[[the Art]]'' started. Members of House Elphaendim, along with other guests, witnessed an assassination attempt at the matriarch of [[House Matrell]] â€“ [[Hetta Matrell]] during the celebration."
