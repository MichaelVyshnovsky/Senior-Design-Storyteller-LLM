The '''Circle of Rust and the Worm''' was a rumored organization that served the god [[Talos]].

Known only in fearful rumor, the Circle of Rust and the Worm was a mysterious group. It was said to consist of insane [[sage]]s and [[spell]]casting mystics of a variety of religious and secular disciplines. They were entropists who sought to destroy the world. They sought the patronage of Talos the Destroyer, and received it.
