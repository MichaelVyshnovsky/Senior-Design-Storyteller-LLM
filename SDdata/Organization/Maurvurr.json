        "Tactics": "The Maurvurr were unusual because they were a band of predominately [[sorcerer]]s and [[wizard]]s, and were only interested in acquiring [[spellbook]]s, magic items, spell components, and substances that could be used in [[alchemy]]. They preyed on caravans and travelers on the [[Trader's Way]] north and west of [[Delzimmer]], using whatever magical Art that would increase their knowledge and arsenal without putting themselves at great risk.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Maurvurr lived in the fringe of the eastern [[Forest of Amtar]] close to the Trader's Way.",
        "Members": "The membership consisted of spellcasters of various races."
