        "mainbody": "The '''Council of Waterdeep''' was a conciliary body formed in the 1480s [[DR]],{{ToD-time}} tasked with meeting the rising threat the [[Cult of the Dragon]] posed to the people of the [[Sword Coast]] and [[the North]].",
        "Organization": "The council was attended by delegates from five of the most influential and powerful factions of [[West Faerûn|the west]] and the North. These 'Five Factions'{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 9}} included the league of city-states known as the [[Lords' Alliance]], agents of the [[Harpers]], and the merchant-mercenaries of the [[Zhentarim]].\n\nAs the largest and arguably most influential of the factions—representing several of the largest city-states of [[Faerûn]]—delegates of the Lords' Alliance held seven seats on the Council of Waterdeep. The other factions held either a single seat, or only a few. Each delegate was accompanied by their own retinue of aides.",
        "Activities": "The Council of Waterdeep held four sessions during which the cult, and their [[chromatic dragon]] allies arose as an ever-increasing threat to the Realms. During each of their meetings, representatives of each faction measured how the council's actions aligned with their own interests, and weighed what resources they could pledge to the cause. A single band of [[adventurer]]s served as an intermediary of sorts between the Five Factions, trying to balance the needs and ideologies of any one group with those of the others.",
        "Base of Operations": "The council held their sessions within the [[Lords' Palace]] in [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].",
        "History": {
            "Formation": "The preliminary events that led to the Council of Waterdeep's founding was the campaign by the Cult of the Dragon to amass a hoard of wealth sufficient enough to appease [[Tiamat]], the Goddess of Dragons . Cult members and their [[storm giant]] accomplice [[Blagothkus]] attempted to transport that wealth aboard [[Skyreach Castle]] to the [[Well of Dragons]] in preparation for the [[ritual]] that would grant Tiamat admittance to [[Faerûn]]. Unfortunately for Tiamat and her cultists, a band of adventurers thwarted that plot and moved back the timeline for their ritual.\n\nNot long after Skyreach Castle was neutralized, agents of the cult sounded the ancient draconic artifact known as the ''[[Draakhorn]]''. The horn's booming call was heard all across the Sword Coast and the North. It was perceived as a call-to-action for dragons across the wester, and was a grim sign of the conflict just on the horizon.\n\nThe true catalyst of the council's formation however was the murder of the [[Masked Lord]] of Waterdeep, [[Arthagast Ulbrinter]], at the hands of the dragon cultists. Lord Ulbrinter was husband to [[Remi Haventree]], a devoted agent of the Harpers. Channeling her anguish into a righteous cause, Remi vowed to dismantle the Cult of the Dragon and rallied members of the Five Factions of the Sword Coast. to the Lords' Palace in Waterdeep. invited a group of [[adventurer]]s to their meeting, and explained to them its cause.",
            "First Council": "During the first Council of Waterdeep, representatives of the Five Factions engaged in heated initial debates. While they were all dedicated to the cause of stopping the Dragon Cult, the councilors had not forged any trust with with each other. They did not have enough information about the state of play to take decided action and no one yet dedicated notable resources towards the campaign against the cult.\n\nThe council did task the adventurers invited by Leosin Erlanthar to investigate [[Varramzord|Varram]] the White, one of the cult's leaders that recently went missing. that was exceptionally knowledgeable about dragonkind and the ''Draakhorn'' itself.\n\nAt some point between the first and second councils, the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] chose to have Lady [[Laeral Silverhand]] succeed Lord Neverember as [[Open Lord]] of the city, and thus take on the role as lead delegate of the Lords' Alliance.",
            "Second Council": "The sounding of the ''Draakhorn'' caused dragons across the lands to became more aggressive. This change became increasingly apparent following the first meeting of the council. As a result of this unsettling behavior of dragonkind, a second session of the council was called in response.\n\nDuring their second meeting, the Council of Waterdeep were updated on the adventurers' successes out in the field. The  Emerald Enclave then solicited the party to investigate the destruction in the [[Misty Forest]] caused by the [[green dragon]] [[Chuth]]. The druidic organization believed the dragon was being manipulated by one of the cult's five [[wyrmspeaker]]s. Dagult Neverember remained in attendance despite his change of office. He was accompanied by a new personal aide named [[Elia]].\n\n[[File:Metallic-dragons-5e.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The [[metallic dragon]]s of the [[Council of Dragons]].]]\nFollowing the council's second meeting, Lord Neverember's aide Elia requested a secret meeting with the adventuring party.\n\nDespite the adventurers' victory, uncertainty and mistrust plagued the council around this time.<ref group=\"note\">According to ''[[The Rise of Tiamat]]'' this event occurred at either the second or third Council of Waterdeep session. Gossip spread among its members that a political aide from Neverwinter killed one of the delegates assistances from Mithral Hall, and subsequently took their own life. These rumors were unfounded however, as the two deaths were actually caused by a [[succubus]] spy aligned with the Cult of the Dragon.",
            "Third Council": "The third Council of Waterdeep was called to assess how each of the factions had been faring up until that point.\n\nThis session also saw the addition of [[Rian Nightshade]] to the negotiations. Rian was introduced as an advisor to Lord Dagult Neverember, but was in fact an agent of the Zhentarim.\n\nWhile the exact specifications of their involvement were unknown, the conclave of metallic dragons made the decision to join the Five Factions in their fight against the Cult of the Dragon.\n\nIn the end, the council dispatched the adventurers to pursue two separate missions that could grant them the upper hand against the cult's efforts. It was also believed that individual could grant them a boon in the coming conflicts against the Cult of the Dragon. a subordinate [[Thay]]'s regent, [[Szass Tam]]. The Thayan Red Wizards were eager to bring to justice to [[Rath Modar]], a member of the [[Thayan Resurrection]] and noted Cult of the Dragon ally.",
            "Fourth Council": "At its fourth and final meeting, the Council of Waterdeep learned that the Cult of the Dragon and their Red Wizard allies were perilously close Hundreds of the cult's chromatic dragon allies were observed in the skies over the Well of Dragons in the [[Backlands]].\n\nThe council held brief discussions over the ultimate fate of Xonthal's Tower. Rian Nightshade expressed distinct interest in acquiring the tower for the Zhentarim, offering over 50,000 [[gp]] to the adventurers for their share.\n\nDuring this session, each councilor made their decision as to what resources their faction could offer in the final battle against the cult. The adventurers offered their opinions as well, serving as advisors to the representatives of the Five Factions. In the end, the party helped unite council at a perilous time, just before the cult's leader [[Severin Silrajin]] could conduct the ritual to summon Tiamat from the [[Nine Hells]].",
            "Resolution": "[[File:March_of_the_Five_Factions.png|thumb|right|400px|''The March of the Five Factions upon the [[Well of Dragons]].]]\nIn the end, the Five Factions of the council banded together and formed a unified army that marched upon [[Tiamat's Temple]] in the [[Well of Dragons]]. The allied army fought through hordes of [[undead]] summoned by the cult and forced to face off against the cult's evil chromatic dragon allies.{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 9}} Fortunately, the metallic dragons joined the battle in the skies above. In the end, the cult's leader Severin Silrajin was briefly able to cajole Tiamat to arrive on the face of Toril, but she was ultimately cast back down{{Cite web/Tyranny of Dragons: Online Comic 10}} to her domain in the Nine Hells."
