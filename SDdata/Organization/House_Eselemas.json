        "mainbody": "'''House Eselemas''' was a tribe of [[yuan-ti]] known for their stealth and skill in battle. Yuan-ti from this house were called '''Eselemaa'''.",
        "Base of Operations": "Nine Eselemaa ruled [[Lushpool]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. These satraps held a majority over Lushpool's sixteen satrapies.\n\nThe majority of Eselemaa lived along the shores of the [[Lapal Sea]] and the northeastern region of the [[Mhair Jungles]], with settlements forming a \"hidden serpent\" all the way to Lushpool.",
        "Relationships": "House Eselemas was the sworn enemy of [[House Se'Sehen]], a feud stemming from rival claims to certain areas of the jungles surrounding the Lapal Sea. The Eselemaa allied themselves with [[House Jennestas]], often fighting together against the Se'Sehen. The [[Coiled Cabal]] remained on good terms with the Eselemaa because of Lushpool's port access to [[Tharsult]]."
