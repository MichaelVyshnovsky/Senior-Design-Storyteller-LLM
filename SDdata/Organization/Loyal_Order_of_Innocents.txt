The '''Loyal Order of Innocents''' was an order of knights that was founded in [[Tethyr]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It comprised some 70 [[paladin]]s and holy fighters loyal to both the Tethyrian crown and the [[church of Torm]].

==Activities==
They claimed as their patron saint, [[Shield of Innocence]], who was once a mortal [[orog]] that sacrificed his life in defense of [[Zazesspur]].

==Possessions==

==History==
The Loyal Order was established by Queen [[Zaranda Star]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, after her coronation following the [[Reclamation Wars]].
