        "mainbody": "The Army of Darkness was a massive force of nearly 60,000\nIt was led by nycaloths. Aulmpiter was leader and tactician Malimshaer was head scout, saboteur, and spy while Gaulguth was field commander.\nEach nycaloth had a legion of five battalions under their command, except Aulmpiter, who had six. Each battalion was led by a summoned mezzoloth general, who each led five regiments of troops. These eighty regiments were each led by colonels who were either the chieftains of the larger tribes who made up the warriors in said regiment or more summoned mezzoloths. Under the colonels were the majors, who tended to be the chiefs of the smaller tribes or further mezzoloths. Under them were the captains and commanders, who consisted mainly of the sons and daughters of the aforementioned chieftains, or again mezzoloths. The giants who joined were all automatically given one of these two ranks (most of them were hill giants who commanded by allowing their mezzoloth second-in-commands to suggest tactics). The commanders each controlled twenty-five warriors (five lots of four soldiers and a sergeant). \nThis organization was the key to the success of the Army, without it, Myth Drannor would have been much less likely to fall as it eventually did. The city did only fall however, once the nycaloths were all slain. The monsters reverted to their normal horde tactics and swept down upon the city en masse.\nIt took twenty-nine months for the armys forces to be gathered.\nThe first military action the army took part in was the attack on the mining and trading encampments in the western Moonsea (eventually this area would become Zhentil Keep) in late autumn of the . By the Feast of the Moon of that same year, the Army attacked the Cormanthor Forest. This was the beginning of the Weeping War."
