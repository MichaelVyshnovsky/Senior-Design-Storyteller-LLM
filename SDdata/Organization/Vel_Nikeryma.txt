The '''Vel'Nikeryma''' (or '''Blade Lords''') was the organization that acted as the guiding council for the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]]. Its purpose was to gather information from across Faer没n in order to dictate the direction of the Eldreth Veluuthra but, in general, they avoided intervention in individual cells' matters.

==Organization==
Although the organization was originally led by members of its five founding families, as of [[1374 DR]], this was no longer the case, and the leadership was determined by voting amongst its most powerful members.

==Recruitment==
Recruitment into the Vel'Nikeryma was through the Eldreth Veluuthra. An established member could apply to become an agent and be granted a sort of free-roaming status in Faer没n. An agent would be expected to gather information and pay a portion of his or her treasure to superiors, in exchange for knowledge of the organization's passcodes, handshakes and symbols. An agent would be able to seek supplies and shelter from a cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra, and only if the agent's stay exceeded a tenday or demands were very high could the cell's leader demand a task be carried out.

==Activities==
Around 1374 DR, agents were sent on treasure hunts to the [[House of Stone]], a ruin near the edge of the [[Ardeep Forest]]. They were also tasked with locating the ancient [[Myth Rhynn]] and restoring its ''[[mythal]]''.

On [[Evermeet]], the organization was responsible for gathering information and subverting [[sun elf]] families.

==Members as of 1374 DR==
* [[Bhyrindar Tellynnan|Bhyrindar "Silverhart" Tellynnan]], the [[werewolf]] leader of the [[High Forest]] cell.
* [[Eldaerneth Spellstalker]], an infiltrator of the [[Night Masks]] in [[Westgate]].
* [[Saeval Calaudra]], an agent who gave support to any cell in Faer没n that needed it and spread the word about the Vel'Nikeryma.
* [[Talindra Amalith]], leader of the [[Methwood]] cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra.
* [[Torynnar Rhaevaern]], a [[baelnorn]] and, as of 1374 DR, the only surviving member of the founders of the Eldreth Veluuthra.

==History==
{{Sectstub}}

Around 1374 DR, a female member of the organization was killed by the [[daemonfey]] in the [[High Forest]], where it was keen to gain more information about the human settlement called [[Olostin's Hold]].
