The '''Order of Ilmater's Brethren''' of the [[Church of Ilmater]] was a division of the greater church known for its members' strict vows of celibacy, poverty, and nonviolence. It was also known as the '''Cormyrean Synod'''.

==Beliefs==
In addition to the vows of poverty, celibacy, and pacificity, members of this order also agreed to refuse magical [[Resurrection (spell)|resurrection]], believing that if they died, it was always [[Ilmater]]'s will.

==Locations==
The sect had a chapter house in the city of [[Zazesspur]] in [[Tethyr]], in the [[Zazesspur/High City/Market District|Market District]], which it shared with the [[House of Tears]], an Ilmatari temple.

==Notable Members==
* Father [[Akkar Donatus]], leader of the Brothers at the House of Tears.
* Father [[Pelletyr]], a [[priest]] of Ilmater who adventured with [[Zaranda Star]] in [[1366 DR]].
