The Order of Ilmaters Brethren of the Church of Ilmater was a division of the greater church known for its members strict vows of celibacy, poverty, and nonviolence. It was also known as the Cormyrean Synod.
In addition to the vows of poverty, celibacy, and pacificity, members of this order also agreed to refuse magical resurrection, believing that if they died, it was always Ilmaters will.
The sect had a chapter house in the city of Zazesspur in Tethyr, in the Market District, which it shared with the House of Tears, an Ilmatari temple.
