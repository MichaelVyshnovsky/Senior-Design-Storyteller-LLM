The '''City Guard''' of [[Muluk]] served as a police force within the city as well as a standing army for the "City of Kings".

==Organization==
The composition of the city guard as of {{Yearlink|1367}}{{AQ-time}} was 2,000 regular infantry, 5,000 militia, and 1,000 cavalry. These forces were under the command of Princess [[Hadra bint Aswiyah|Hadra]]. An additional 1,500 [[mamluk]]s of the [[Respected Mamluk Society]], 500 of whom were cavalry, were commanded by General [[Oman Abd al-Hazim]]. Muluk's navy consisted of 20 ships that included 4 large [[dhow]]s.

==Activities==
Muluk's navy patrolled the waters of the [[Great Sea]] between the city and the edge of the islands of the [[Corsair Domains]], as well as inland along [[Al-Zalim River]].

The dhows were used primarily to escort Muluk's fabric safely to [[Qudra]].
