        "mainbody": "The '''Yaerthal Dynasty''' was the first ruling dynasty of [[Dambrath]].",
        "Overview": "The dynasty began in [[545 DR]] when the [[Arkaiun]] warchief [[Reinhar I|Reinhar Yaerthal]] united the Arkainun tribes of Dambrath under his leadership and led them to war against [[Luiren]] and [[Halruaa]]. After his death at war, his son, [[Reinhar II]], took command of his father's army; however, he was defeated by Halruaa. Reinhar II retreated back to Dambrath and consolidated his new kingdom there.\n\nIn [[600 DR]], [[Reinhar III]] and his sons were killed by [[giant]]s while on a hunting trip, and this triggered a brief war of succession. At the end of it, Reinhar III's nephew succeeded him and took the name [[Reinhar IV]].<ref name=tGHotR-p92>\n\nThe entire dynasty contained nine kings of the same name. By the time of [[Reinhar IX]] in [[802 DR]], the Arkaiun of Dambrath were a lazy people, yet Reinhar the Foolish, as he was known to history, insisted on leading his people to expand their territory as Reinhar I had attempted. His plans were stopped, however, when his people encountered the [[drow]] of [[T'lindhet]], leading to a 30-year war. The war ended with betrayal in [[831 DR]] when a [[half-elven]] [[Cleric|priestess]] of [[Loviatar]] named [[Cathtyr Shintar]] offered her assistance and that of her fellow half-elven pilgrims to the [[human]]s to defend against the drow. Instead, Cathtyr murdered Reinhar within a week and offered a truce to the drow armies, thus setting herself up as the new queen of Dambrath and founder of the [[Crinti]] [[Hazm'cri Dynasty]].",
