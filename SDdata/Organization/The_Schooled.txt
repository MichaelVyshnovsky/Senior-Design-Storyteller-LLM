'''The Schooled''' was the name given to the students of the [[Magister]] [[Caldauvur Maerglauthyn]]. The Magister enforced ironclad discipline amongst his students through spells, but he accepted anyone into his classes; even his greatest detractors understood he meant to create a body of mages with conscience, strong ethics and a common understanding of principles. At least one of the communities of the Schooled lived in a manor within the lower [[Dessarin Valley]].{{cite book/Secrets of the Magister|58}}
