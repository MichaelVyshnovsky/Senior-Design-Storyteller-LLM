The Guthmeres were a patriar family of Baldurs Gate around 1482 DR. They owned many butcheries and tanneries.
In the late 15 century DR, Lady Eshvelt Guthmere was a member of the Parliament of Peers of Baldurs Gate and was a supporter of law and order brought forth by the steel watchers and their creator â€“ the lowborn Lord Enver Gortash.
