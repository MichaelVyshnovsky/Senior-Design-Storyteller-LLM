        "mainbody": "The Church of Tiamat, also known as the Cult of Tiamat and by other names, was the primary religious organization dedicated to the worship and service of the goddess of chromatic dragons, Tiamat.\nThe church of Tiamat was regimented by a strict hierarchy of ranks and titles. \nAcolytes were known as Wyrmfodder, while higher ranking priests were collectively known as the Dark Scaly Ones, a practice that originated in Unther.\nThe leader of the cult of Tiamat in Unther before the Time of Troubles was Tiglath, who disappeared during the battle between Tiamat and Gilgeam.\nFrom 1374 DR onwards, again under Tiglaths administration, the hierarchy system was simplified and this new was accepted by most branches of the Church, with only few temples using the old hierarchy system. The new organization was based on the colors of the most common varieties of chromatic dragons. Those new titles were, in ascending order white adepts, black adepts, green adepts, blue adepts and red adepts. Only red adepts could become high priest of a temple.\nThe clergy of Tiamat was mostly focused on two tasks first was to acquire an ever-increasing wealth and prestige, and to sabotage the faiths of all other gods. As a result, they occupied most of their time with an unending series of thefts, assassinations, acts of vandalism, and arson. In Unther and Chessenta this meant seizing as much power as possible, while in western Faerûn, this meant to subvert the Cult of the Dragon to the service of Tiamat. \nThe Church believed that when Tiamat assumed her throne as the only goddess of the Realms, her draconic children would serve as her dukes, and her clergy struggled to gain the position of vassals when that time came. \nthumb|right|350px|Followers of Tiamat praising their goddess\nClerics of Tiamat prayed for their spells at dusk, in hopes she will return the sun the following morning, as part of a ritual known as Tithing. The Tithing required a small tithe, typically several gold coins or a small gem, which were hidden in the clerics cupped hands while praying, then buried.\nTiamats clergy also performed various other daily ceremonies in homage to their mistress. The Rite of Respect was a complicated ritual of abasement and appeasement was performed while approaching any chromatic dragon. This ceremony didnt provide any special protection from the dragons fury, but failure to perform it was a death sentence.\nIn Unther, a sect of her followers known as the Dark Scaly Ones proclaimed the day of the first full moon after Midsummer a holy day dedicated to her. Known as the Festival of Vengeance, this day marked the defeat of Gilgeam at Tiamat hands. In Unthalass the day was celebrated by general anarchy, rioting, and widespread mayhem incited by the clergy and the faithful. During that day, clerics of other gods tried to contain the looting and destruction, and prominent officials were aware against assassination attempts executed by Tiamats worshipers.\nBy 1374 DR, the Church of Tiamat was strongest in Unther and Threskel. The center of Tiamats worship in Unther was the settlement of Firetrees.\nThough most evil dragons honored Tiamat, few keep shrines dedicated to her in their lairs because they didnt want her gazing at their treasure hoards. Instead, they dedicate vast, gloomy caverns to their deity and kept them stocked with treasure and sacrifices.\nTiamat had more temples among her non-dragon followers. The two most prominent sites of her faith were the Altar of the Scales in Unther, and the Wings of the Queen Reborn beneath the ruins of Castle Perilous in Vaasa.\nTo Tiamat, deities of all creeds and from every pantheon were inherently tyrannical, and therefore her rivals. She considered herself the only being powerful enough to defy these gods and overthrow their despotic rule,\nThe most important thing for this faith were power and wealth, and there were very few limits to the depravities and perversions Tiamats worshipers were wiling to commit in the pursuit of such goals.\nChromatic dragons were believed to be the spawn of Tiamat, and therefore worthy of veneration.\nThe Serpent Guards were a fellowship of Untherite warriors and crusaders fanatically devoted to Tiamat. They were charged with guarding Tiamats cult in Unther.\nThe Knights of the Five-Thorned Rose were her elite five ranking crusaders, tasked with the destruction of the followers of Bahamut, especially metallic dragons.\nThe Church of Tiamat was opposed to every other religious organization of Faerûn, but it was especially opposed to the churches of the other gods of the Untheric pantheon and the church of Bahamut.\nThe first recorded appearance of the Cult of Tiamat in the country of Unther in the Old Empires was in the . The Cult summoned the Dark Lady in the .\n* Tiglath, a warrior-priest eager to destroy Gilgeam.\n* Shudu-Ab, leader of the Cult of Tiamat in the .\n* Furifax, bandit lord allied with the Cult.\n* Skuthosiin, the green dragon mount of Tiglath."
