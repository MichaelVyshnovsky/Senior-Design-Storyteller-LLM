The '''Diligent Mamluk Society''', also known as the '''Diligent''', was a military organization in [[Zakhara]].

==Activities==
Within the [[Warehouse District (Huzuz)|Warehouse District of Huzuz]], the Diligent Mamluk Society acted as a security force. Though only possessing roughly 200 members, the [[mamluk]]s vigilantly guarded their masters' property against theft and even fire on occasion.

==Organization==
Platoons comprising ten guards and a single leader patrolled the streets of the Warehouse district, with 3 full platoons on duty each night. Patrol leaders would discuss and vary their routes every evening to dissuade thieves from recognizing patterns in their movements. Ethical priests of [[Hajama]] and specialized [[sea mage]]s also supported the Diligent though this assignment was often seen as "beneath them." The sea mages came in handy when fighting fires within the Warehouse District.

==Possessions==
The Diligent favored weapon was the [[Khopesh|khopesh sword]] but many also carried a [[katar]] (punching dagger) for close fighting. Because of the brutal heat from the sun, daytime patrols equipped themselves with standard [[padded armor]] while their nighttime counterparts favored [[chain mail]].
