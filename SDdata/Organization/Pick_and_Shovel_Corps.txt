The Pick and Shovel Corps was a military organization within the Sevenfold Mazework of the Great Dismal Delve.
3,500 slaves and gladiators made-up this organization. The gladiators were typically freed after performing above and beyond their station.
Derro served as the "picks" and dwarves formed the "shovels".
Both groups wanted to create their own separate communities, but the dao kept them dependent on their generosity for food and tools.
The Sevenfold Mazework within the Great Dismal Delve served as base of all dao military organizations.
