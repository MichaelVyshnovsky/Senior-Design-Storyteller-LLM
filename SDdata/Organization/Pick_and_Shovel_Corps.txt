The '''Pick and Shovel Corps''' was a military organization within the [[Sevenfold Mazework]] of the [[Great Dismal Delve]].
 
==Organization==
3,500 slaves and gladiators made-up this organization. The gladiators were typically freed after performing above and beyond their station.

==Activities==
[[Derro]] served as the "[[pick]]s" and [[Dwarf|dwarves]] formed the "[[shovel]]s".

Both groups wanted to create their own separate communities, but the [[dao]] kept them dependent on their generosity for food and tools.

==Base of Operations==
The Sevenfold Mazework within the Great Dismal Delve served as base of all dao military organizations.
