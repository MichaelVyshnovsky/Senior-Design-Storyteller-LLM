The '''Eldermore''' family was one of the prominent noble houses of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The family was founded by [[Harken Eldermore]], who, by the late 14{{th}} century DR, hadn't been seen in several "lifetimes."{{Cite trumpeter/1-1|3}}

[[Windstand House]], an apartment building in the [[Gowntown]] neighborhood of Ravens Bluff, was owned by the Eldermore family until Lord [[Ampner]], a major landlord and real-estate owner of the city, won it in a game of chance in the midâ€“14{{th}} century DR. To his disdain, the Windstand was a crumbling and decaying mess of a building.

In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, [[Dianna Eldermore]], the young and beautiful heiress of the Eldermore family, disappeared alongside a band of [[Living City]] adventurers following the celebration of [[Remembrance Day]]. Eyewitnesses to the disappearance stated an odd thing: Dianna Eldermore said she decided to remain with Harken Eldermore, the family's founder and Dianna's uncle... However, Harken has not been seen in quite some time, making most believe he had passed away a long time ago. One thing was known: Lady Dianna and her companions were part of some adventure prior to her disappearance, and some even reported a nasty-looking wound to be involved. The disappearance was reported on by [[Jacinth Moonspring]] in the pages of ''[[Ravens Bluff Trumpeter]]'' but lacked any revelations, only promising a further investigation into the matter.
