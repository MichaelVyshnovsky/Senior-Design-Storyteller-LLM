The '''Wychlaran''', meaning "wise old women" in the ancient language of [[Halardrim]], also known as the '''Witches of Rashemen''' outside their lands, were the spiritual leaders of [[Rashemen]], communing with the spirits and guiding the souls of the Rashemi people.

==History==
The Witches of Rashemen were formed in {{Yearlink|-108}} by a group of [[Raumviran]] witches. They swore to preserve the lore and magic of [[Raumathar]], and protect the land, people, and spirits of Rashemen until the end of the world.

==Membership==
The formal term for a member of this group was "[[hathran]]" ("learned sister"), while the most powerful and respected were called "[[othlor]]" ("true one"). In Rashemen, a member of the Wychlaran could do no wrong. Her word was law and to disobey it was punishable by death.

==Face-Veils==
The most striking part of a Wychlaran's garb were the Rashemi witch-masks, properly called the face-veils of the Wychlaran Rashemaar or ''asatheirr'', meaning "world-face." These masks varied in design, but most that covered the upper half of the wearer's face were very old, as by the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] newer designs tended to cover most or all of the face. Most were large enough to cover the sides of a witch's face and had ear openings on each side for ease of wearing. The masks also had eye holes and nose slits that allowed the wearer to breathe easily due to the mask's shape.{{Cite web/theedverse/2023-01-25 - Rashemi Witch-Masks}}

These full-face face-veils were light shells of a pressed and hardened mix of hemp fiber and special plant leaves, lined with cloth on the inside. These masks were attached to the witch's head via a headband, or a series of pins coated in peeling [[poison]] if they needed to be used offensively. 

The outer shells could be dyed in almost any color and were used as a fashion statement by many, who decorated them with designs, family marks, personal badges or sigils, and marks signifying the witch's rank and achievements. A special long axis vertical, four-pointed star painted on a witch-mask signified the wearer's seniority, while a semi-circular image of an upper half of a human eye with a long axis vertical, diamond eyeball at the bottom center identified the wearer as a person of advanced seniority. These marks were applied using dark or metallic paints, usually navy blue and very dark green, with black being exceedingly rare as the color symbolized angry mourning and the path of revenge among the Wychlaran.

==Regions==
The Witches of Rashemen were based in [[Urlingwood]], an area forbidden to any non-Wychlaran. Any trespassers found in the wood were killed on sight. The [[witch]]es met here to brew [[jhuild]], as well as to bind and control hostile spirits and spy on [[Thay]]an forces.

While most Witches of Rashemen sought to protect the land and ensure peace, some merely desired power. These were known as the [[Durthan]]. These cruel women focused on the spirits of destruction and vengeance that resided in the land. They dreamed of attacking [[Thay]] and [[Narfell]] and making [[Thesk]] pay tribute to use the [[Golden Way|Gold Road]]. Also unlike the Wychlaran, they included many non-humans among their ranks, such as [[hag]]s.
