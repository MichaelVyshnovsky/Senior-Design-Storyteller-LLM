The '''Qu'encesta''' were a far-ranging tribe of [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nars]] found in  [[Narfell]] known for their savage nature. There were 2,700 Qu'encesta in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Though they often treated foreigners with hostility, the Qu'encesta were on decent terms with the other tribes of Nar found in Narfell. There was always a chance that any defeated outsider would be allowed to flee the boundaries of Narfell if the Qu'encesta believed they fought bravely.

==Base of Operations==
The Qu'encesta dominated most of central Narfell between [[Icelace Lake]] and the [[Rawlinswood]].
