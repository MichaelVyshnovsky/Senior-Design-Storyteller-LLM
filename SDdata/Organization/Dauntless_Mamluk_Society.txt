The Dauntless Mamluk Society, also known as the Dauntless, was a military organization in Zakhara.
This mamluk organization specialized in exploration and the recovery of powerful magical items and artifacts.
The Dauntless were led by General Kemil Abd al-Jasir.
Qudra was the center of power for this organization, though they did maintain a strong presence in Huzuz. The Grand Caliph was heavily supported by this group.
