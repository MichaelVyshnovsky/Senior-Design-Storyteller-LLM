The Ladies of Renown was an adventuring company from the city of Myrmyr in the Var, active in the late 15 century DR.
The adventuring band consisted of warriors and mages, and like most powerful individuals in the regions â€“ they all were females. The Ladies of Renown rivaled other female, or mostly female, human adventuring companies such as The Whip of Flames and The Sisters of the Moon, with their feuds and plots being a legendary topic.
In the late 15 century DR, the Ladies of Renown either discovered or created a magic flying ship that rivaled the famed Halruaan skyships. The adventuring band used the magic ship to attack citadels, fortified homes, and domed fortresses of their rivals in the city of Kellazzann in Ulgarth.
