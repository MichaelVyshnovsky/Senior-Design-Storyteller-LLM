'''The Ladies of Renown''' was an adventuring company from the city of [[Myrmyr]] in the [[Var]], active in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The adventuring band consisted of [[warrior]]s and [[mage]]s, and like most powerful individuals in the regions â€“ they all were females. The Ladies of Renown rivaled other female, or mostly female, [[human]] adventuring companies such as [[The Whip of Flames]] and [[The Sisters of the Moon]], with their feuds and plots being a legendary topic.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Ladies of Renown either discovered or created a magic flying ship that rivaled the famed ''[[Halruaan skyship]]s''. The adventuring band used the magic ship to attack citadels, fortified homes, and domed fortresses of their rivals in the city of [[Kellazzann]] in [[Ulgarth]].
