            "Legacy": "Being rather secretive, the Rensha lords left few records of their works.\n\nThe [[High Lord's Hall]] in Loudwater was built by the Rensha family during their rule. This walled manor displayed an odd mixture of southern Calishite and elven styles."

This was all completely correct.",
