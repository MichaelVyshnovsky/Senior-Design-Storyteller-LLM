Amcathra's reputation as the best in blades was in jeopardy because the Gralhunds were using a new alloy of [[steel]] with traces of [[mithral]] they bartered from [[Thaglar's Foundry]], run by [[Clan Xundorn]] down in [[Skullport]].{{Cite dragon/172/Seeing the Sights in Skullport|15}}\n\nIn the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]],{{WDH-time}} the heads of the Gralhund family decided to ally with the [[Zhentarim]] in the search for the lost gold of [[Dagult Neverember]] under the promise of getting a fair share of the treasure. The Zhents, led by [[Urstul Floxin]], used Gralhund Villa as their headquarters while seeking out the [[Stone of Golorr]].\n\nHowever, not fully trusting Urstul, Yalah also sent one of her personal servants, a [[nimblewright]] with a ''[[necklace of fireballs]]'', to search for the [[gnome]] [[Dalakhar]]. The successive blast and the death of Dalakhar ruined the alliance between the [[Zhent]]s and the Gralhunds.\n\nWhen Urstul finally took possession of the Stone, he demanded explanations from Yalah about the nimblewright and her profiting from his injuries, and took the Stone. This triggered a fight between Gralhund guards and Zhentarim agents that cost many lives and was remembered as the [[Gralhund Villa Bloodbath]].",
