        "mainbody": "House Gralhund () was a noble house of Waterdeep since the Year of the Broken Blade, 1260 DR. Their primary business interests included contracting hireswords and manufacturing weapons.\nThe Gralhund family were of Tethyrian descent The tieflings were usually sent to a Gralhund estate in Yartar.\nIn the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, the Gralhunds were competing fiercely with House Amcathra in blade-making, producing higher-quality swords and selling them at a lower price. Amcathras reputation as the best in blades was in jeopardy because the Gralhunds were using a new alloy of steel with traces of mithral they bartered from Thaglars Foundry, run by Clan Xundorn down in Skullport.\nIn the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, the heads of the Gralhund family decided to ally with the Zhentarim in the search for the lost gold of Dagult Neverember under the promise of getting a fair share of the treasure. The Zhents, led by Urstul Floxin, used Gralhund Villa as their headquarters while seeking out the Stone of Golorr.\nHowever, not fully trusting Urstul, Yalah also sent one of her personal servants, a nimblewright with a necklace of fireballs, to search for the gnome Dalakhar. The successive blast and the death of Dalakhar ruined the alliance between the Zhents and the Gralhunds.\nWhen Urstul finally took possession of the Stone, he demanded explanations from Yalah about the nimblewright and her profiting from his injuries, and took the Stone. This triggered a fight between Gralhund guards and Zhentarim agents that cost many lives and was remembered as the Gralhund Villa Bloodbath.\nYalah Gralhund planned to use the intelligence resources of the Black Network in order to unveil some of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep and blackmail or bribe her way into membership.\nThe Gralhund family kept a villa in Waterdeeps North Ward between Saerdoun Street and Horn Street off of Pony Way. The villa grounds were enclosed by a  stone wall with a main gate onto Horn Street. The entire compound was roughly wedge-shaped and was approximately  in total area. The main building was two stories tall and was approximately  total. A , single-story guard barracks adjoined the manor house, and there was a separate, single-story,  stable that had an entrance onto Saerdoun Street.\n*Greth Gralhund\n*Irg \"Hund\" Gralhund\n*Orond Gralhund\n*Ostryn Gralhund\n*Tlannada Grahund\n*Tomassin Gralhund\n*Yalah Gralhund\n*Zartan Gralhund"
