        "mainbody": "The '''Fellowship of Innkeepers''' was one of the oldest [[Guilds of Waterdeep|guilds]] of [[Waterdeep]]. The collective of innkeepers and owners banded together to share information for their mutual protection, typically warning one another of problematic clientele such as [[thieves]], rowdy patrons, or troublesome [[wizard]]s.",
        "Activities": "The fellowship collectively bargained for products they all used, such as drink, linens, and laundering services, to acquire them at a discount for their respective establishments. They also shared their funds to hire a band of well-armed guards whose services would otherwise be well beyond their budgets.\n\nEvery nine nights, the guildmaster opened up [[Fellowship Hall]] for its members, so they could enjoy the luxuries of staying in a quality inn for a change.",
        "Membership": "Entrance into the fellowship had to be approved by a majority of the existing guild members and cost 25 [[gp]]. Annual dues were 20 gp."
