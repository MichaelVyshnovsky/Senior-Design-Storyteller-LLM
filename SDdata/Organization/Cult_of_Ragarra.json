        "mainbody": "he Cult of Ragarra was a religious organization in Zakhara dedicated to the worship of Ragarra, the savage Zakharan jungle goddess.\nAs of 1367 DR, the Cults power was severely diminished compared to their influence throughout the Cities of the Ancients during the centuries that predated the spread of Enlightenment.\nThe primary goal of the Cult during the 14 century DR was to reestablish worship of their goddess by any means necessary. It was not sheer coincidence that the number of crocodiles living in the rivers and canals of the Ruined Kingdoms increased drastically with the resurgence of the Cult. Any who still dared to oppose Ragarra met grisly ends while traveling the waterways in the region.\nPriests of Ragarra visited the villages of the jungle, demanding tribute for their goddess. Any who refused had their personal property rended.\nBefore its decline, the empire of Kadar outlawed worship of Ragarra and destroyed all temples associated with the goddess, littering the jungle with ruins.\nThe Cult of Ragarra was based in the heart of the wild jungles of the Cities of the Ancients region of east Zakhara, mainly within Dihliz, Rogosto, and Kadarasto.\nThe Prince of Kadarasto, Nari ibn Aman secretly courted the Cult of Ragarra, allowing them to infiltrate his city."
