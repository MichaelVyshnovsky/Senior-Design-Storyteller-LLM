        "mainbody": "The '''Jesters' Guild''', formerly known as the '''Ancient and Revered Order of Merrymakers''', was a branch of [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers|Musicians' Guild]] that long sought to breakaway{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|21}}{{Cite comic/Showtime! or Revenge of the Living Monologue|17}} and by the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] had succeeded in becoming their own guild.",
        "Members": "The membership of the Jesters' Guild was made up of various clowns, comedians, and [[jester]]s.{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|20}} The core elite of the guild was formed by [[magic-user]]s, who stood out from others by altering the [[verbal component]]s of their [[spell]]s into joke lines.{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|23}}",
        "Activities": "The Jesters' Guild was one of many in Waterdeep that had its own codes of conduct. One of these rules by which they abided by was that anyone who dared to heckle a member of the guild would in turn be publicly mocked and taunted for four days by no less than four members of the guild.",
        "Base of Operations": "The main guildhall of the Jesters' Guild was the [[Jesters' Clubhouse]], a small building in the city's [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, a plot was hatched by the Musicians' Guild to obtain the corpse of [[Myrrth]],{{Cite comic/Showtime! or Revenge of the Living Monologue|15-17}} an infamous Waterdhavian jester from the 13{{th}} century [[DR]] who learned of a joke that had the power to kill,{{Cite comic/Showtime! or Revenge of the Living Monologue|24}}{{Cite comic/Die Laughing|1-3}} so that they may divine from it that \"killing joke\" and make a bid to cease control over all of Waterdeep. To this end they used a mole, [[Doofut]], to propose the plan the upstart breakaway Jester's Guild, thereby setting them up to take the fall and be discredited if the plan failed.\n\nSensing that someone was planning to rob his grave, Myyrth's spirit manifested on the [[Prime Material plane]] and went in search of [[adventurer]]s at [[Selûne's Smile]] to prevent his remains from being disturbed. There he encountered the willing group of [[Kyriani Agrivar]], [[Onyx the Invincible]], and [[Vajra Valmeyjar]].<ref>{{Cite comic/The Spirit of Myrrth|2-4}} However, the party was beaten to the [[Anteos]] family's crypt in the [[City of the Dead]] by the Jester's Guild, who had taken Myrrth's remains to their headquarters, without the knowledge of the Musicians' Guild.<ref>{{Cite comic/The Spirit of Myrrth|2,6,10,14-15}}<ref>{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|22-24}}\n\nAfter securing Myrrth's skeleton, the Jester's Guild's magic-users, using a series of spells in the forms of joke set-ups, turned it into a skeletal colossus.{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|23-25}} They also [[Imbue undead with spell ability|imbued it]] with a number of spells including ''[[flame breath]]'', ''[[frost breath]]'', and ''[[withering gaze]]''.<ref>{{Cite comic/Showtime! or Revenge of the Living Monologue|8}} Each spell having been memorized by one of the members.{{Cite comic/Showtime! or Revenge of the Living Monologue|18}}\n\nThe order set the skeleton loose to wreck havoc across the city until the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] yielded to their demand of being recognized as an official guild,<ref>{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|21-25}}{{Cite comic/Showtime! or Revenge of the Living Monologue|9}} particularly directing its ire towards [[Castle Waterdeep]]. but the order quickly lost control of their undead creation and their guildmaster Bazzle died from its ''flame breath'' whilst trying to stop it.<ref>{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|13-14,18}}\n\nMany tried in vain to stop the skeleton's rampage, but ultimately it was the remaining magic-users of the order who returned Myyrth's skeleton to its original unanimated state by reciting a memorized series of ''[[counterspell]]s'', in the form of punchlines, in a precise order with Kyriani standing in for the deceased Bazzle.<ref>{{Cite comic/Showtime! or Revenge of the Living Monologue|18-22}} In the process, Myrrth's skull came loose and was caught by Onyx just before it shattered on the ground, only for him and Vajra to both be promptly knocked out by a member of the Musicians' Guild and the skull taken.<ref>{{Cite comic/Beneath the City of the Dead|22-25}}\n\nReturning with Myrrth's skull to the [[House of Song]], they hired a [[Sorlyn]] [[cleric]] to use ''[[speak with the dead]]'' on it to ascertain the specifics of the jester's notorious joke.<ref>{{Cite comic/Die Laughing|4-5}} The skull's demeanor stalled their progress for long enough for the heroes of Selûne's Smile to track the guild down and intervene. In the chaos of the confrontation between the heroes and the guild, the skull ended up being passed to Doofut, who was unable to shield it from Kyriani's ''[[magic missile]]s'',<ref>{{Cite comic/Die Laughing}} thereby returning Myyrth's spirit to the [[afterlife]].<ref>{{Cite comic/Die Laughing|22-23}}"
