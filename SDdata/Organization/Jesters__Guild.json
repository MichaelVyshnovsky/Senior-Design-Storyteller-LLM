        "mainbody": "century DR – 1357 DR)\nThe Jesters Guild, formerly known as the Ancient and Revered Order of Merrymakers, was a branch of Waterdeeps Musicians Guild that long sought to breakaway and by the 15 century DR had succeeded in becoming their own guild.\nThe membership of the Jesters Guild was made up of various clowns, comedians, and jesters. The core elite of the guild was formed by magic-users, who stood out from others by altering the verbal components of their spells into joke lines. \nThe Jesters Guild was one of many in Waterdeep that had its own codes of conduct. One of these rules by which they abided by was that anyone who dared to heckle a member of the guild would in turn be publicly mocked and taunted for four days by no less than four members of the guild.\nThe main guildhall of the Jesters Guild was the Jesters Clubhouse, a small building in the citys Dock Ward.\nIn the , a plot was hatched by the Musicians Guild to obtain the corpse of Myrrth, an infamous Waterdhavian jester from the 13 century DR who learned of a joke that had the power to kill, so that they may divine from it that \"killing joke\" and make a bid to cease control over all of Waterdeep. To this end they used a mole, Doofut, to propose the plan the upstart breakaway Jesters Guild, thereby setting them up to take the fall and be discredited if the plan failed.\nSensing that someone was planning to rob his grave, Myyrths spirit manifested on the Prime Material plane and went in search of adventurers at Selûnes Smile to prevent his remains from being disturbed. There he encountered the willing group of Kyriani Agrivar, Onyx the Invincible, and Vajra Valmeyjar. However, the party was beaten to the Anteos familys crypt in the City of the Dead by the Jesters Guild, who had taken Myrrths remains to their headquarters, without the knowledge of the Musicians Guild.\nAfter securing Myrrths skeleton, the Jesters Guilds magic-users, using a series of spells in the forms of joke set-ups, turned it into a skeletal colossus. They also imbued it with a number of spells including flame breath, frost breath, and withering gaze. Each spell having been memorized by one of the members.\nThe order set the skeleton loose to wreck havoc across the city until the Lords of Waterdeep yielded to their demand of being recognized as an official guild, particularly directing its ire towards Castle Waterdeep. but the order quickly lost control of their undead creation and their guildmaster Bazzle died from its flame breath whilst trying to stop it.\nMany tried in vain to stop the skeletons rampage, but ultimately it was the remaining magic-users of the order who returned Myyrths skeleton to its original unanimated state by reciting a memorized series of counterspells, in the form of punchlines, in a precise order with Kyriani standing in for the deceased Bazzle. In the process, Myrrths skull came loose and was caught by Onyx just before it shattered on the ground, only for him and Vajra to both be promptly knocked out by a member of the Musicians Guild and the skull taken.\nReturning with Myrrths skull to the House of Song, they hired a Sorlyn cleric to use speak with the dead on it to ascertain the specifics of the jesters notorious joke. The skulls demeanor stalled their progress for long enough for the heroes of Selûnes Smile to track the guild down and intervene. In the chaos of the confrontation between the heroes and the guild, the skull ended up being passed to Doofut, who was unable to shield it from Kyrianis magic missiles, thereby returning Myyrths spirit to the afterlife."
