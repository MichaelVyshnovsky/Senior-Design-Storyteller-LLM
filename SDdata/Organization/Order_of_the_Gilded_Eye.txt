The Order of the Gilded Eye was an over-zealous military organization dedicated to the eradication of extra-planar evil throughout the Realms. They were relentless in their efforts, actively seeking out those they perceived as malevolent and harmful and launching preemptive assaults without provocation.
The primary mission of Gilded Eye inquisitors was to protect the North and the realms beyond from otherworldly threats, particularly demons that originated from the Lower Planes of the cosmos. Beyond that however, they sought to destroy any individual they thought to be corrupted by fiendish influence, as well as persecute anyone who opposed or went against their beliefs.
They formed trading relationships in order to finance their operations and were known to hire adventurers to aid in some endeavors.
The order was headquartered in Helms Hold, a fortress-city dedicated its patron deity and home of its founder, Javen Tarmikos.
The Order of the Gilded Eye was an offshoot of the Order of the Gauntlet, another military group with strong ties to the "good-aligned" faiths of Faer√ªn. Unlike the soldiers and knights of the Gauntlet, warriors and inquisitors of the Gilded Eye had no hesitation to punish evil before any crime or misdeed was committed.

The order was formed sometime before Uktar of the , at a time when Helm was still perceived as being dead among the people of the Realms. Javen Tarmikos was meditating upon Helms holy symbol in the long-abandoned cathedral in Helms Hold when he received a vision the Eye of Helm began to weep golden tears. Not long after, other Helmite priests of the Hold began to receive similar manifestations and were even granted access to divine magic.Uktar 2 is the starting date The Sentinel novel. Several tendays after this date, Helm returns to the Realms and presumably can offer divine magic to his followers once again. Bolstered by this renewed strength of faith by his fellow clergymen, Javen gathered those loyal comrades belonging to the Order of the Gauntlet and formed the Gilded Eye, quickly taking over Helms Hold as their own.
After the orders formation, by the 1490s DR, Helms Hold had once again become the site of public executions, as their enemies were hung on public gallows and their bodies burned to prevent resurrection.
