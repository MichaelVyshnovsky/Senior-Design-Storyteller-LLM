The '''Order of the Gilded Eye''' was an over-zealous military organization dedicated to the eradication of extra-planar [[evil]] throughout the Realms. They were relentless in their efforts, actively seeking out those they perceived as malevolent and harmful and launching preemptive assaults without provocation.

==Activities==
The primary mission of Gilded Eye inquisitors was to protect [[the North]] and the realms beyond from otherworldly threats, particularly [[demon]]s that originated from the [[Lower Planes]] of the cosmos. Beyond that however, they sought to destroy any individual they thought to be corrupted by [[fiend]]ish influence, as well as persecute anyone who opposed or went against their beliefs.

==Tactics==
They formed trading relationships in order to finance their operations and were known to hire [[adventurer]]s to aid in some endeavors.

==Base of Operations==
The order was headquartered in [[Helm's Hold]], a fortress-city dedicated its patron deity and home of its founder, [[Javen Tarmikos]].

==Relationships==
The Order of the Gilded Eye was an offshoot of the [[Order of the Gauntlet]], another military group with strong ties to the "[[good]]-aligned" faiths of [[Faer√ªn]]. Unlike the soldiers and knights of the Gauntlet, warriors and inquisitors of the Gilded Eye had no hesitation to punish evil before any crime or misdeed was committed.

==History==
[[File:Banagar.png|thumb|''Sir [[Banagar]], a loyal member of the Order of the Gilded Eye.'']]
The order was formed sometime before [[Uktar]] of the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, at a time when Helm was still perceived as being dead among the people of the Realms. Javen Tarmikos was meditating upon Helm's [[holy symbol]] in the long-abandoned [[Cathedral of Helm|cathedral]] in Helm's Hold when he received a vision: the Eye of Helm began to weep golden tears. Not long after, other Helmite priests of the Hold began to receive similar manifestations and were even granted access to [[divine magic]].<ref group="note">[[Uktar 2]] is the starting date ''[[The Sentinel]]'' novel. Several [[tenday]]s after this date, Helm returns to the Realms and presumably can offer divine magic to his followers once again. Bolstered by this renewed strength of faith by his fellow clergymen, Javen gathered those loyal comrades belonging to the Order of the Gauntlet and formed the Gilded Eye, quickly taking over Helm's Hold as their own.

After the order's formation, by the 1490s DR, Helm's Hold had once again become the site of public executions, as their enemies were hung on public gallows and their bodies burned to prevent ''[[resurrection]]''.
