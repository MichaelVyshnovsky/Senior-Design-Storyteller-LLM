        "mainbody": "The Sewerkeepers was a criminal organization, part of the Guild, that operated under the cover identity of the sewer maintenance worker druids of the Sewer Keep in the Lower City of Baldurs Gate in the late 15 century DR.\nThe Sewerkeepers took over the Sewer Keep, financed by the patriars of the Gate, erected in the Seatower neighborhood. The Keeps function was to treat and purify the citys sewage before it was released into the River Chionthar. The publics refusal to finance the sewage purifying eventually led to the projects collapse. What was left of the Keep was taken over by the Sewerkeepers crew under the leadership of Kingpin Genamine Kopali. The so-called druids and technicians of the Keep were disguised thieves who used the Keeps pipes and sewers for their illicit activities, burglaries, smuggling, and occasionally, monster-hunts.\nDespite being a criminal organization, the Sewerkeepers did employ several actual druids who kept the Keep running, using shambling mounds to purify the sewage and trained beasts to be used as guards.\nDuring Genamine Kopalis rule, the Sewerkeepers were paid by Mortlock Vanthampur, a member of the patriar Vanthampur family, to inform him of the strange happenings under the city. During the Absolute crisis of the , the newly-risen Kingpin named Stone Lord, started a guild war against the Guild, strategically taking out the Guilds agents, kingpins, and taking over their territory. The Stone Lord was a thrall of the Cult of the Absolute, and as a part of the guild war, his men torched the Sewerkeeperss base, killing its members and Genamine Kopali herself however, the Guild failed to recover the dead Kingpins body."
