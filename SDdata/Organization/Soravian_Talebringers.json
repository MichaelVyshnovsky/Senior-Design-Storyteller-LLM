The people of Soravia trusted them.\nThe Talebringers acted for some time but emerged politically after 1357 DR when the duchy of Soravia was at risk of falling into chaos with its ruler, a puppet of Zhengyi, killed in battle with Gareth Dragonsbane. Many of them joined Gareth in his quest to free Damara. In 1359 DR, they cleared the land of any minions of Zhengyi who remained and answered to all the citizens requests."
