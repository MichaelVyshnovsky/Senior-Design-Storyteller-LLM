        "mainbody": "lan Stoneshaft was a family of shield dwarves that hailed from the Sword Coast region of the North.\nLike most dwarven families, Clan Stoneshaft was led by a single family head. As of the midâˆ’14 century the head of the clan was Ebenezer Stoneshaft.\nDwarves of Clan Stoneshaft were found to often enjoy the abundant and varied culture that could be found in the grand metropolis of Waterdeep, including its fashions and styles of music found within. They were known as skilled metalsmiths and gem-workers, particularly for their craftsmanship of jewelry and other decorations that were worn on the body.\nDue to years spent in isolation the clan as a whole were rather withdrawn and unforthcoming.\nWarriors of Clan Stoneshaft preferred to wear plate mail armor and wield bludgeoning weapons in battle.\nOriginally the dwarves of Clan Stoneshaft dwelled within an underground clanhold, located beneath the southern border of the Mere of Dead Men.\nThroughout the latter of the 14 and all of the 15 centuries DR, the Stoneshaft dwarves resided within Stoneshaft Hold, a fortress that was gifted to them by one of their greatest allies.\nThe Stoneshaft dwarves were weary of Waterdhavian politics, especially any related to the noble Margaster family.\nIn the , agents of the Zhentarim traveled through a stretch of the Underdark in order to seize the keep of Thornhold by means of its subterranean tunnels. They marched through the Stoneshaft clanhold and routed their kin, killing many and enslaving many others.\nEbenezer Stoneshaft rallied his fellow clansmen that managed to survive and allied with a member of the Harpers named Bronwyn Caradoon. Together they managed to defeat the Zhentarim at Thornhold, and reclaim the keep that once belonged to Bronwyns ancestor, Samular Caradoon. As an act of friendship, Bronwyn bequeathed her familys keep to Clan Stoneshaft under its new name, Stoneshaft Hold.\nThe dwarves new home proved quite profitable for well over a decade, as it was a crucial waystop for merchants and travelers venturing north along the High Road around the Mere of Dead Men. Unfortunately the boon of commercial wealth stopped in the years following the Spellplague, in the , as geological changes cause the Mere to expand southward and cut off overland travel to Stoneshaft Hold.\nClan Stoneshaft languished in isolation in the decades that followed. During these years they hoarded their resources and honed their skill as craftspeople.\n* Baklin, the bartender of the Quaffing Quaggoth and lookout for Waterdhavian Red Sashes.\n* Ebenezer Stoneshaft, head of the clan in the 14 century.\n*Rhorrina, a vampire spawn of Artor Morlin.\n* Thear Chessar, a danger-loving thief from Waterdeep.\n* Tuvala, a vampire and cleric of Abbathor."
