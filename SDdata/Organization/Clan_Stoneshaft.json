        "mainbody": "'''Clan Stoneshaft''' was a family of [[shield dwarves]] that hailed from the [[Sword Coast North|Sword Coast]] region of [[the North]].",
        "Organization": "Like most dwarven families, Clan Stoneshaft was led by a single family head. As of the midâˆ’14{{th}} century the head of the clan was [[Ebenezer Stoneshaft]].<ref name=\"SCAG-p65 />",
        "Activities": "Dwarves of Clan Stoneshaft were found to often enjoy the abundant and varied culture that could be found in the grand metropolis of [[Waterdeep]], including its fashions and styles of music found within. They were known as skilled metalsmiths and [[gem]]-workers, particularly for their craftsmanship of jewelry and other decorations that were worn on the body.<ref name=\"SCAG-p66>\n\nDue to years spent in isolation the clan as a whole were rather withdrawn and unforthcoming.",
        "Tactics": "Warriors of Clan Stoneshaft preferred to wear [[plate mail]] armor and wield [[:Category:bludgeoning weapons|bludgeoning]] weapons in battle.<ref name=\"SCAG-p66 />",
        "Base of Operations": "Originally the dwarves of Clan Stoneshaft dwelled within an underground clanhold, located beneath the southern border of the [[Mere of Dead Men]].<ref name=\"SCAG-p65 />\n\nThroughout the latter of the 14{{th}} and all of the 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]], the Stoneshaft dwarves resided within [[Stoneshaft Hold]], a fortress that was gifted to them by one of their greatest allies.<ref name=\"SCAG-p65 />",
        "Relationships": "The Stoneshaft dwarves were weary of [[Waterdhavian]] politics, especially any related to the [[nobility of Waterdeep|noble]] [[Margaster]] family.<ref name=\"SCAG-p65 /><ref name=\"SCAG-p66 />",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, agents of the [[Zhentarim]] traveled through a stretch of the [[Underdark]] in order to seize the keep of [[Thornhold]] by means of its subterranean tunnels. They marched through the Stoneshaft clanhold and routed their kin, killing many and enslaving many others.<ref name=\"SCAG-p65 />\n\nEbenezer Stoneshaft rallied his fellow clansmen that managed to survive and allied with a member of the [[Harpers]] named [[Bronwyn Caradoon]]. Together they managed to defeat the Zhentarim at Thornhold, and reclaim the keep that once belonged to Bronwyn's ancestor, [[Samular Caradoon]]. As an act of friendship, Bronwyn bequeathed her family's keep to Clan Stoneshaft under its new name, Stoneshaft Hold.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|11}}\n\nThe dwarves' new home proved quite profitable for well over a decade, as it was a crucial waystop for merchants and travelers venturing north along the [[High Road]] around the Mere of Dead Men. Unfortunately the boon of commercial wealth stopped in the years following the [[Spellplague]], in the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, as geological changes cause the Mere to expand southward and cut off overland travel to Stoneshaft Hold.<ref name=\"SCAG-p65 />\n\nClan Stoneshaft languished in isolation in the decades that followed. During these years they hoarded their resources and honed their skill as craftspeople.",
