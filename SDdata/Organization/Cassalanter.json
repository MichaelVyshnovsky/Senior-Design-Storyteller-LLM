A Shrine of [[Myrkul]] was the part of the family crypt.",
        "History": "House Cassalanter was ennobled in the {{YearlinkName|1248}} when the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] recognized several merchant houses and granted them noble titles and seals.\n\nIn [[1368 DR]], Cassalanters loaned two ten-million [[Golden lion (coin)|golden lions]] with a huge interest rate. The first loan was to [[Widow Silvermane]] who ran a [[lottery]] in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] of Waterdeep, and the second one went to the [[Field of Triumph]] Race Track in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]]. The astronomical loans were caused by goddess [[Tymora|Tymora']]s luck going out of control all over the Realms. Every single gambler picked the winning number and winning [[horse]]s, costing Widow Silvermane and the Field of Triumph disastrous losses.\n\nIn [[1370 DR]], a [[skeleton]] dressed in Cassalanter family garb was seen attacking several Waterdhavians. These incidents attracted the attention of the city's [[Lords of Waterdeep]]. The [[undead]] came from the family's old crypt in [[Undermountain]], and a lone hero was sent to investigate the restless Cassalanter ancestors. The hero successfully destroyed the undead and the [[ghoul]] [[necromancer]] behind the infestation, [[Ghoulmaster]] and the noble family offered a hefty reward for the deed.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Cassalanters faced imminent bankruptcy. In order to prevent it, in {{Yearlink|1489}}{{Waterdeep-time}} Ammalia and Victoro struck a deal with the [[archdevil]] [[Asmodeus]], trading the souls of their children in exchange for instant financial comeback. Their eldest son, Osvaldo, was taken immediately and transformed into a [[chain devil]], while the younger twins Elzerina and Terenzio were scheduled to be taken on the occasion of their 9{{th}} birthday, one [[tenday]] after [[Founders' Day]] of {{Yearlink|1492}}.\n\nSometime before 1492 DR, one of the Ladies of House Cassalanter caused quite a stir by wearing a gown colored with a certain variety of loud maroon [[dye]] to one of her grand parties that took place in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] of Waterdeep.",
