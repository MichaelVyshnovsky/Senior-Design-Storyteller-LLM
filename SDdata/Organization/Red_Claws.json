        "mainbody": "he Red Claws were a prominent goblinoid tribe in Thar active beginning in the mid–14 DR.Elminsters Ecologies The Great Gray Land of Thar briefly lists the Red Claws among noted orc tribes, but their coverage in Dragon #361 \"The Tribes of Thar\" makes it explicit that they are a goblinoid tribe. This article uses the later, more detailed version. In-universe, it might be assumed the Red Claws have been misidentified, replaced, or is a different tribe with the same name.\nThey were a large tribe of goblins and hobgoblins. Their warlord in the mid–14 century DR was Hashrad, a hobgoblin marshal.\nThey had an alliance with a fearsome pack of worgs. On worg-back, the Red Claws could raid all across Thar and the surrounding lands.\nThe Red Claws were based in the Red Castle in southern central Thar, standing around 20 miles (32 kilometres) north of the coastal trail linking Melvaunt and Phlan.\nThis was an old ogre fortification dating back to when ogre kings ruled Thar. The goblinoids built half-floors and quarter steps out of timber and fieldstone to convert the giant-sized spaces into smaller goblin-friendly areas.\nThe Red Claws were one of the most common threats to the peoples of the Moonsea around 1372 DR. They harassed travelers between Melvaunt and Phlan, no matter how well-protected a caravan, with Hashrad demanding riches—calling it variously a toll, tribute, or bribe—from anyone he could. However, he would often claim to lose control over his minions or to have not received his tribute, all as an excuse to demand more payment and attack and rob regardless.\nBeginning in 1479 DR, the Red Claws became embroiled in wars for dominance among the many monstrous tribes of Thar following the Battle of Lendons Dike."
