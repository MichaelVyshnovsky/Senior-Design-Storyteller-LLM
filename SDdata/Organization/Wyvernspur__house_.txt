'''Wyvernspur''' was a noble house of [[Cormyr]].
{{quote|''If it weren't for [[Tymora]]'s Luck, that whole family would have died out years ago, even with my blessing. Present company included.''|[[Sel√ªne]], referring to the House Wyvernspur, talking to [[Finder Wyvernspur]]}}

==Holdings==
House Wyvernspur had a seat at [[Redstone Castle]] in [[Immersea]], where the most prominent local building was a fortified sandstone manor house on a high hill just south of town. The family also owned [[Wyvernspur House]] in [[Suzail]].<ref>

The family owned most of the land surrounding [[Wyvernwater]] and the [[Wyvernflow]], bringing substantial wealth and political influence. House Wyvernspur had additional holdings in [[Hultail]].<ref> The [[Hullack Forest]] was mentioned as also belonging to the Wyvernspurs.

==History==
The crown of Cormyr often called upon this family to fund projects in their area and near Hullack Forest. In the event of [[Azoun IV]]'s death during the [[Abraxus incident]], this family favored a [[Vangerdahast]] regency instead of a ruling council.

The Wyvernspurs were granted all [[Cormaeril]] lands after the Cormaerils were stripped of title after the Abraxus affair, which approximately quintupled the income and responsibilities of House Wyvernspur.

In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], House Wyvernspur thrived, flush with money, number of living family members, and family accolades.

==Notable Members==
