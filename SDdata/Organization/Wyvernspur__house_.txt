Wyvernspur was a noble house of Cormyr.
House Wyvernspur had a seat at Redstone Castle in Immersea, where the most prominent local building was a fortified sandstone manor house on a high hill just south of town. The family also owned Wyvernspur House in Suzail.
The family owned most of the land surrounding Wyvernwater and the Wyvernflow, bringing substantial wealth and political influence. House Wyvernspur had additional holdings in Hultail. The Hullack Forest was mentioned as also belonging to the Wyvernspurs.
The crown of Cormyr often called upon this family to fund projects in their area and near Hullack Forest. In the event of Azoun IVs death during the Abraxus incident, this family favored a Vangerdahast regency instead of a ruling council.
The Wyvernspurs were granted all Cormaeril lands after the Cormaerils were stripped of title after the Abraxus affair, which approximately quintupled the income and responsibilities of House Wyvernspur.
In the late 15 century DR, House Wyvernspur thrived, flush with money, number of living family members, and family accolades.
