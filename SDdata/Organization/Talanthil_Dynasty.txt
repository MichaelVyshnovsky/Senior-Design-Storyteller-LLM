The Talanthil Dynasty was the second dynasty to assume power in the nation of Raumathar, reigning from -605 DR to -150 DR. With the sudden deaths of the last remnants of the Nhalass Dynasty killed by demons from Narfell, Raumathar was left without a clear leading family. However, the Talanthils rose to power during this time with the overwhelming support of the public.
