The '''Talanthil Dynasty''' was the second dynasty to assume power in the nation of [[Raumathar]], reigning from [[-605 DR]] to [[-150 DR]]. With the sudden deaths of the last remnants of the [[Nhalass Dynasty]] killed by [[demon]]s from [[Narfell]], Raumathar was left without a clear leading family. However, the Talanthil's rose to power during this time with the overwhelming support of the public.
