The Heart of All Mountains comprised the bulk of the armed forces of the dao within the Great Dismal Delve.
Nine thousand dao heavy infantry made up the Heart of All Mountains.
The infantry was drilled and indoctrinated in loyalty to the Great Khan on a regular basis. The khan used them to deal with noble dao who troubled him. They also hunted down merchants who owed taxes.
The Sevenfold Mazework within the Great Dismal Delve served as base of all dao military organizations.
