The '''Coiled Cabal''' was a secretive order of [[yuan-ti]] [[wizard]]s devoted to [[Sseth]], the World Serpent.

==Activities==
Members of the Coiled Cabal would go to any length to keep their existence a secret. Even most yuan-ti commoners were unaware that of their brethren had developed sorcerous powers. They preferred to grow in strength and hoard their power, waiting for the day when the yuan-ti empire would rise to prominence.

The Coiled Cabal was allied with [[House Eselemas]].

As of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Coiled Cabal assumed control over the ruined town of [[Lhesper]] while searching for the [[Emeralds of Merrshaulk]]. The Coiled Cabal appreciated the strategic location of Lhesper and forced the bandit tribes in the region to bring any travelers directly to them to serve as sacrifices or [[broodguard]]s.

==Organization==
The Coiled Cabal was composed of [[yuan-ti abomination]]s, [[Yuan-ti malison|malisons]], and [[Yuan-ti pureblood|purebloods]]. Each wizard was usually accompanied by half a dozen apprentices.

==Base of Operations==
The Coilded Cabal's center of power was deep within the [[Forest of Wyrms]] near the village of [[Serpent's Cowl]].
