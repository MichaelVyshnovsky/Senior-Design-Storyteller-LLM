The Coiled Cabal was a secretive order of yuan-ti wizards devoted to Sseth, the World Serpent.
Members of the Coiled Cabal would go to any length to keep their existence a secret. Even most yuan-ti commoners were unaware that of their brethren had developed sorcerous powers. They preferred to grow in strength and hoard their power, waiting for the day when the yuan-ti empire would rise to prominence.
The Coiled Cabal was allied with House Eselemas.
As of the , the Coiled Cabal assumed control over the ruined town of Lhesper while searching for the Emeralds of Merrshaulk. The Coiled Cabal appreciated the strategic location of Lhesper and forced the bandit tribes in the region to bring any travelers directly to them to serve as sacrifices or broodguards.
The Coiled Cabal was composed of yuan-ti abominations, malisons, and purebloods. Each wizard was usually accompanied by half a dozen apprentices.
The Coilded Cabals center of power was deep within the Forest of Wyrms near the village of Serpents Cowl.
