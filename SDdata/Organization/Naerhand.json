        "mainbody": "ouse Naerhand was a merchant house operating from the Sword Coast to the western Sea of Fallen Stars as of 1479 DR.  Although the clan was fabulously wealthy, they avoided joining the ranks of nobles, preferring to work behind the scenes.  The family dominated the harness making trade and controlled key rest stops and watering holes along trade routes.  The family owned hundreds of properties in Suzail, Athkatla, Saerloon and Waterdeep and placed spies within many noble families in Waterdeep and Cormyr.  The Naerhands were known for avenging any wrongs done to the family although they often used indirect means to achieve vengeance.Ed Greenwood. \"Eye on the Realms  The House of Naerhand  Family Games of Power.\" Dungeon  #177.
