The Griffon Knights were a group of fighters responsible for the safety and security of the town of Alamontyr in the Border Kingdoms.
The Griffon Knights served Alamontyrs ruler, Shield Duke Bardran Thulmaer. They were known for bearing lances to which they sometimes attached magic wands.
The Griffon Knights venerate the Red Knight as their patron deity, after an incident which happened in the mid-14 century DR that they refused to discuss with anybody. A mansion in town was subsequently converted into a small castle and shrine to their deity.
When an agent of Zhentil Keep made an attempt to assassinate the Shield Duke, the Griffon Knights dismembered him and the various body parts were sent in packages to different members of the ruling Council of Zhentil Keep.
The badge of the Griffon Knights was a full-face silver shield held aloft by two white wings on a dun background.
