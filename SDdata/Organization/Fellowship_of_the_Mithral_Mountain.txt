The '''Fellowship of the Mithral Mountain''' was an order of [[priest]]s dedicated to the [[god]] [[Geb]] of the [[Mulhorandi pantheon]], active around [[1370 DR]]. The majority of adventuring priests of Geb were members of this order.

The fellows were charged with discovering the location of a legendary mountain supposed to contain large [[mithral]] deposits.<ref>
