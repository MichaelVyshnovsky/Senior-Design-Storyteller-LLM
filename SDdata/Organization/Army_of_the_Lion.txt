The '''Army of the Lion''' was a subsection of the [[Aglarond]]an army stationed at the fortress [[Undumor|Emmech]] (later Undumor) and tasked with the defence of the nation against the threat from [[Thay]] through the [[Tannath Gap]]. In [[1374 DR]] it was led by Lord [[Gante Demelin]]. Its battle wizards were led by [[Canton Karlesad]], while the [[Aglarondan griffonrider]]s were led by Captain [[Araevil Darkeye]]. A special detachment of the army was assigned to guard the ruler of Emmech at the time: Lady [[Mantelia Parsuns]].
