The Army of the Lion was a subsection of the Aglarondan army stationed at the fortress Emmech (later Undumor) and tasked with the defence of the nation against the threat from Thay through the Tannath Gap. In 1374 DR it was led by Lord Gante Demelin. Its battle wizards were led by Canton Karlesad, while the Aglarondan griffonriders were led by Captain Araevil Darkeye. A special detachment of the army was assigned to guard the ruler of Emmech at the time Lady Mantelia Parsuns.
