Mamluks were individuals who grew up as slaves in Zakhara. They were usually taken from unenlightened tribes as children.
These children were brought to enlightenment and schooled in various areas including warfare, discipline and administration. 
Children were matched with whatever mamluk organization paired best with his or her natural talents. Mamluks were supervised by superior officers.  The Grand Caliph in Huzuz ultimately supervised all mamluks since they were technically his property. Mamluk soldiers were the most elite fighting force in Zakhara. The different mamluk groups had special facial tattoos they used to identify members. More elaborate tattoos denoted a higher rank.  Attempts to mimic mamluk tattoos was a crime in Zakhara.
