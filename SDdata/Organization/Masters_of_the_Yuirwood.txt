Masters of the Yuirwood were nigh-undetectable while moving through the forest. They enjoyed a strong connection with the animals of the forest and were [[speak with animals|readily able to communicate with them]].

They utilized a ''[[portal]]'' network that comprised numerous [[menhir]] circles located throughout the Yuirwood. With these menhir circles, they alone were able to rapidly move across the woods in order to respond to any growing threats. Beyond the forest, they could even travel to the [[elven]] realm of [[Sildëyuir]].

More experienced masters were able to use the ''portals'' to travel to forests in other areas of [[Faerûn]], or even another menhir circle located on another world.

==Base of Operations==
The maintained their headquarters in the forest town of [[Relkath's Foot]].

==History==
Throughout their history the group was able to reclaim some territory of the [[Aglarondan Peninsula]] that was previously lost.
