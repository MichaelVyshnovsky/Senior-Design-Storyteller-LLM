        "mainbody": "century DR.\nThe Druids of Tall Trees were a secretive order of druids in the High Forest in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. With repopulation of their home, the organization partially abandoned their private ways allowing visitors and guests to their forest home.\nThey let few others into their woods and groves. Their main goal was to combat expansion and protect the Tall Trees within the High Forest. The organization was led by the Great Druid of the North Uthgang Jyarl in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. Prior to Uthgang, the leadership was in the hands of Sinklayr Greenstroke. As of 1342 DR, the Druids of Tall Trees counted two dozen members and two dozen associates, agents, and allies who came and went from the forest. Most senior members were druids venerating Mielikki with followers of Eldath and Silvanus present. Additionally, a band of rangers and several spellcasters were associated with the Druids of Tall Trees and aided them in times of need.\nThe Druids of Tall Trees were caretakers of the ancient oak trees, nurturing the forests nature and preserving what was left of Eaerlann, the ancient wood elven kingdom of the High Forest. Many parties sought to plunder the old kingdom for its ancient magics, treasures, and knowledge.\nNew members recruitment was a slow process. When new members were needed, the Druids of Tall Trees sent out their allies outside the forest to search for capable individuals. These agents usually were wood elves or rangers who approached prospects asking for their aid in some task related to security and preservation of the High Forest. These requests started with smaller tasks, gradually increasing in danger. Eventually, when the Druids were satisfied with the prospects and deemed them trustworthy, membership was offered.\nDruids of Tall Trees made a home in the High Forests northeastern portion, surrounded by some of the biggest and oldest trees of all Faerûn. The organization lived among the Teuveamanthaar, an ancient Eaerlanni community with whom they venerated the three gods of nature Eldath, Mielikki, and Silvanus.\nthumb|A map of 360x360px\nThe Druids of Tall Trees were formed after the tragedy of the  – the fall of nearby Ascalhorn. The keep fell to an army of tanarri, and the wood elven kingdom of Eaerlann soon followed. A group of Mielikkian druids took it upon themselves to protect the abandoned Teuveamanthaar that was sure to be overrun by humanoids. These Mielikkians hailed from Ascalhorn and were welcomed by the forests wood elves to study druidcraft and nature. When their elven teachers fled, the druids chose to replay kindness by guarding their old masters homes.\nArchmage Tulrun spent three centuries after the  in the Cold Wood of the High Forest. During that time, he allied closely with the Druids of Tall Trees.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Eldreth Veluuthra and House Dlardrageth were regular threats to Teuveamanthaar. As the druids remained in seclusion for almost 500 years, their life still changed little until the tumult of the 14 century that saw an elven communitys return to Teuveamanthaar. Elves of Caerilcarn reclaimed the forest home and established New Eaerlann, giving the Druids of Tall Trees new co-habitants and allies. With this significant change to the organizations seclusion came a swelling of their numbers and an increased number of outside allies.\n*Uthgang Jyarl, Great Druid of Mielikki and leader of the order in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\n*Sinklayr Greenstroke, a former Great Druid who resided within the Tall Trees in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\n*Aerosclughpalar, a gold dragon in human disguise in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\n*Elighaer Teushandor, a half-moon elf druid of Mielikki active in the late 14 century DR.\n*Sarragh of the Sparrows, Mielikkian druid initiate active in the late 14 century DR.\n*Vanuseed, a treant druid emissary from Turlang in the late 14 century DR.\n*Balt Greenbrow, a ranger ally in the late 14 century DR."
