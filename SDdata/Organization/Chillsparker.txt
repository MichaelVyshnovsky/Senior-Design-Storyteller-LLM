Chillsparkers were goblin booyahg sorcerers from Dragonscar Gorge. As of the late 15 century DR, they considered their own status among their tribes to be akin to that of archmages in more civilized lands.
Chillsparkers wielded wands carved with runes. When they were coerced into joining the Frosthunger Horde, the Hordes name was etched onto their wands.
In the late 15 century DR, Shattercrown and his frost giants arrived in Dragonscar Gorge to force the areas goblinoids to excavate the ruins of Thrymstone, and the Chillsparkers likewise found themselves coerced into their service. When members of the Frosthunger Horde tried to flee and escape to Shimmersky Valley, the Chillsparkers led the charge. Once the Valley had been overrun, the Chillsparkers began attacking travelers near the entrance of the Valley.
