'''Chillsparkers''' were [[goblin]] [[Goblin_dictionary#B|booyahg]] [[sorcerer]]s from [[Dragonscar Gorge]]. As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], they considered their own status among their tribes to be akin to that of [[archmage]]s in more civilized lands.

==Possessions==
Chillsparkers wielded [[wand]]s carved with runes. When they were coerced into joining the [[Frosthunger Horde]], the Horde's name was etched onto their wands.

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Shattercrown]] and his [[frost giant]]s arrived in Dragonscar Gorge to force the area's [[goblinoid]]s to excavate the ruins of [[Thrymstone]], and the Chillsparkers likewise found themselves coerced into their service. When members of the Frosthunger Horde tried to flee and escape to [[Shimmersky Valley]], the Chillsparkers led the charge. Once the Valley had been overrun, the Chillsparkers began attacking travelers near the entrance of the Valley.
