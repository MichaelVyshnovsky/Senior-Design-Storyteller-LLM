'''House Vemmil''' was a powerful [[Amn]]ian trade family during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The Vemmils had wide-reaching mercantile interests and a focus on trading [[wine]], [[beer]], and [[alchemical]] supplies. During his time as leader, [[Quorl Vemmil]] added [[poison]]s and [[drug]]s from southern and eastern [[Faerûn]] to the family business as he worked with the [[church of Talona]].

==History==
Quorl became the Lord of the house in the {{YearlinkName|1302}}, and managed to become [[Tessarch]] in [[1333 DR]] when the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] was first founded.

This state of affairs was interrupted by Quorl's attempt to overthrow [[Meisarch]] [[Thayze Selemchant]], which resulted in his quick death in the {{YearlinkName|1345}}.

In [[1369 DR]], a Vemmil trade fleet returning from [[Zakhara]] was attacked by pirates. Four ships were lost in [[Eleint]], but the remaining seven arrived in [[Murann]] to great acclaim and profit for the family.{{cite book/Lands of Intrigue/Amn|23}}
