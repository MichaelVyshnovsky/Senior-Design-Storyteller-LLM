'''House Vandree''' was the 17th [[drow]] house of [[Menzoberranzan]] in [[1358 DR]] and therefore one of the minor drow houses in the city. By [[1480 DR]], it had become the eighth house and thus a member of the Ruling Council.

==Headquarters==
House Vandree was located in a huge, walled compound south of [[House Do'Urden]] in the district of [[West Wall]]. The compound's main walls extended outwards (to the east) from the wall, appearing almost like a prow.

==Activities==
The members of House Vandree were very interested in Surface affairs and frequently collected trophies from the Surface, from leaves to [[human]] skulls.

==History==
A tragic fate came upon one of the daughters of House Vandree around the year [[1322]].{{Cite web/What Happened Before Daughter of the Drow?}} [[Sosdrielle Vandree]] became one of the latest liaisons of the archmage [[Gromph Baenre]] and gave birth to his daughter [[Liriel Baenre|Liriel]]. When Gromph realized her talent for magic, he arranged the death of her mother Sosdrielle as an accident and took his daughter into [[House Baenre]].

Around [[1357 DR]], [[Dinin Do'Urden]] spent a year infiltrating House Vandree at the order of [[Jarlaxle]] of [[Bregan D'aerthe]] in preparation for an attack. Dinin was recalled when Jarlaxle found a more interesting opportunity with [[Vierna Do'Urden]] and her lust for [[Drizzt Do'Urden]].

Shortly after the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]], when the house ranked seventeenth,

House Vandree was in a most precarious situation around [[1368 DR]]. Their numbers were few but their compound grand. Their neighboors of [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]] had made it known that they coveted the Vandree compound. For this reason Matron [[Troken'ther Vandree]] tried either to win the protection of [[House Baenre]], or get [[Yvonnel Baenre]] to demand a civilized swap of the compounds. But the old Baenre hesitated to do so. On the one hand there had been too much chaos in the recent past among the leading houses, but on the other hand, Yvonell was eager to see Barrison Del'Armgo get into a fight and show what they could do. But there was a spark of hope for House Vandree; they had a long-standing tradition of getting into trouble and somehow finding a way out. Troken'ther and her offspring seemed to delight in internal feuding and dangerous political ploys. House Vandree even dabbled in surface-world affairs, acquiring all sorts of trophies and useful magical items. There were rumors that human skulls, fashioned into drinking goblets, were their favorites.

House Vandree fell to the position of the twentieth house by [[1372 DR]].

By [[1480 DR]], House Vandree rose quickly to become the eighth house and thus a member of the [[Ruling Council]].

Sometime before the late 15{{th}} century DR, a High Priestess from House Vandree became involved with then-young [[Minthara Baenre]]. The women remained lovers for some time until Minthara received an order to end the High Priestess. Minthara [[poison]]ed her lover and stayed at her side, whispering words of comfort until the priestess died.
