Brossfeather () was a noble Waterdhavian house that had a long history of wealth and prosperity for over a hundred years as of the late 14 century DR.
Their holdings were in forestry and lumber businesses.
The family had a villa in the North Ward of the city, located between Brassfeather Lane and Anteos Lane. It was aptly named Brossfeather Towers, with an architecture that was similar to the Stagsmere rental villa.
