        "mainbody": "The Order of the Jade Blade was an organization based in Loudwater and the personal agents of High Lord Kalahar Twohands in the 1370s DR. It was likely named after the famous jade-green bastard sword wielded by Kalahar.\nThe Order of the Jade Blade had been only recently formed by the .\nIn that year, Kalahars five-year-old son, Velvred, was kidnapped and taken into one of the Rensha tombs beneath the High Lords Hall. Kalahar himself was warned by divinations that if he were to enter the tombs he would surely be killed. Therefore, he requested an adventuring party go into the tombs in his stead to either reconnoiter the area or rescue Velvred. If they rescued Velvred from the wererat bandit lord known as the Hark and returned, then Kalahar would induct them all into the Order of the Jade Blade.For saving Nardine, the Humility module references the unreleased Secret of Phantoms Cloister, for which the events are unknown.\nOn Eleint 23, 1372 DR, Jade Blade members were among the Loudwater forces mustered by Stedd Rein for an assault on the Dungeon of the Hark to root out the Hark and his bandits.\nMembers of the Order of the Jade Blade may have been recruited to help in various matters in and around Loudwater over 1372 and 1373 DR.Membership of the Order of the Jade Blade is a \"story object\" for the Legacy of the Green Regent RPGA campaign, carried only by PCs who fully completed Under High Lords Hall or the unreleased Secret of Phantoms Cloister. As such the appearances and actions of the order depend on which PCs play which modules. The relevant modules are listed below for the record.\nMembers of the Order of the Jade Blade served the needs of High Lord Kalahar Twohands in whatever problems the town faced. They could request an audience with him if needed, albeit at the lords convenience, and ask to speak with other authority figures in town. They could also ask superiors or allies for special favors or magical assistance with matters they investigated, such as scrying and teleportation. Their authority aided them in investigating and gathering information in town.\nMembers could also be called upon by Loudwater militia leaders like Gauntlet Harazos Thelbrimm to assist in matters such as investigating murders. Other important people in Loudwater could request members to aid them in important tasks, such as when Prior Athosar sought help finding a cure to the slimy doom disease.\nIn general, they had an obligation to aid and protect the town and its citizens. Demanding payment for such services would ruin a members reputation in town and lose them Kalahars trust."
