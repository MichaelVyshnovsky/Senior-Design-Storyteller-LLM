        "mainbody": "The '''Order of the Jade Blade''' was an organization based in [[Loudwater]] and the personal agents of High Lord [[Kalahar Twohands]] in the 1370s [[DR]]. It was likely named after the famous [[jade]]-green [[bastard sword]] wielded by Kalahar.",
        "History": "The Order of the Jade Blade had been only recently formed by the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.\n\nIn that year, Kalahar's five-year-old son, [[Velvred Twohands|Velvred]], was kidnapped and taken into one of the [[Rensha]] tombs beneath the [[High Lord's Hall]]. Kalahar himself was warned by [[divination]]s that if he were to enter the tombs he would surely be killed. Therefore, he requested an adventuring party go into the tombs in his stead to either reconnoiter the area or rescue Velvred. If they rescued Velvred from the [[wererat]] bandit lord known as [[the Hark]] and returned, then Kalahar would induct them all into the Order of the Jade Blade.<ref group=\"note\">For saving Nardine, the ''Humility'' module references the unreleased ''[[Secret of Phantoms' Cloister]]'', for which the events are unknown.\n\nOn [[Eleint 23]], 1372 DR, Jade Blade members were among the Loudwater forces mustered by [[Stedd Rein]] for an assault on the [[Dungeon of the Hark]] to root out the Hark and his bandits.\n\nMembers of the Order of the Jade Blade may have been recruited to help in various matters in and around Loudwater over 1372 and [[1373 DR]].<ref group=\"note\">Membership of the Order of the Jade Blade is a \"story object\" for the Legacy of the Green Regent RPGA campaign, carried only by PCs who fully completed ''Under High Lord's Hall'' or the unreleased ''Secret of Phantoms' Cloister''. As such the appearances and actions of the order depend on which PCs play which modules. The relevant modules are listed below for the record.",
        "Activities": "Members of the Order of the Jade Blade served the needs of High Lord Kalahar Twohands in whatever problems the town faced.<ref> They could request an audience with him if needed, albeit at the lord's convenience,<ref><ref> and ask to speak with other authority figures in town.<ref> They could also ask superiors or allies for special favors or magical assistance with matters they investigated, such as [[scrying]] and [[teleportation]].<ref> Their authority aided them in investigating and gathering information in town.<ref>\n\nMembers could also be called upon by Loudwater militia leaders like Gauntlet [[Harazos Thelbrimm]] to assist in matters such as investigating murders.<ref> Other important people in Loudwater could request members to aid them in important tasks, such as when Prior [[Athosar (Loudwater)|Athosar]] sought help finding a cure to the [[slimy doom]] disease.<ref>\n\nIn general, they had an obligation to aid and protect the town and its citizens.<ref><ref> Demanding payment for such services would ruin a member's reputation in town and lose them Kalahar's trust.<ref>"
