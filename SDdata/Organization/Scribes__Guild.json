        "mainbody": "The Scribes Guild was one of the most famous craft guilds in all of Mulhorand, with membership being considered one of the most prestigious positions in the nation.\nThe Scribes Guild was based in the city of Gheldaneth, in the Arcanum of Magic, which was both a university and a dedicated temple of Thoth.\nThe members of this guild directed activities within the Arcanum of Magic, served as administrators or scribes within the government of Mulhorand, and directed most of the engineering projects that went on in both Gheldaneth and the surrounding region.\nThose students who were considered among the very best at the Arcanum of Magic were accepted as apprentices within the Scribes Guild, regardless of their social class. To this end, it was possible for a slave to become a member of the Scribes Guild, as education at the Arcanum of Magic was compulsory for all citizens of Gheldaneth.\nBeing based in the Arcanum of Magic, the Scribes Guild had close ties to the Church of Thoth. All of its members held status as \"lay members\" within the Church and had the opportunity to pass entrance tests at the Arcanum to become full-fledged members of the Thothian clergy. In addition, the sacred Thothian fellowship known as the Order of the Ibis Feather often recruited from the elite of the Scribes Guild."
