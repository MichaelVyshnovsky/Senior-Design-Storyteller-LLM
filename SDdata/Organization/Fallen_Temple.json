        "mainbody": "The '''Fallen Temple''', also known as the '''Temple of the Broken Hammer''', was a cult once devoted to [[Tyr]] responsible for many crises in the [[Utter East]] until the late 14{{th}} century.",
        "History": "Originally, the Fallen Temple was a branch of the [[Church of Tyr]], led by Patriarch [[Justarvis]], High Avenger of Tyr's Church of the Southern Clave of the Moonshaes, that accompanied the [[Ffolk]] in their migration from the [[Moonshae Isles]] to the Utter East alongside branches of the [[Church of Umberlee]], the [[Church of Chauntea]], the [[Church of Tempus]], and the [[Church of Waukeen]].\n\nBut Patriarch Justarvis allied himself with Count [[Boarswic]], the [[Northmen]], the followers of [[Tempus]], who, when their ships were struck with plague and turned away by each port and town, convinced him to get retribution. Soon, Justarvis and his followers began to kill, loot, and raze, though they labeled their deeds righteous and their victims deserving of punishment. Tyr didn't see it that way and punished Justarvis with a horrible doom, as a [[kraken]] grabbed him and his guards and pulled them under the sea, just hours before the Ffolk's [[Right Armada]] landed in Utter East.\n\nThe heretic Tyrran priests who followed him faced twin punishments, both secular and divine. First, they were given no right to vote at the final Great Council and when the Founding Lords carved up the Utter East between themselves, they granted the Tyrrans no fiefs of their own, neither individually nor collectively. Second, Tyr himself forbade them all holy powers and spells.\n\nThus, the resentful heretics looked for a new source of divine power, and in time their descendants devoted themselves to the mysterious [[Ysdar]], an old and wicked power of the [[Outer Planes]] that had based itself in the Utter East and desired the destruction of all life there. The Fallen Temple preyed on everyone in all the Five Kingdoms, and in time it even managed to claim its own ''[[bloodforge]]'', either by digging one up or seizing it from someone.\n\nThe cultists plagued the Utter East, gathering their new adepts among the conquered [[Mar]]. They had many cells in every city and all cultists received their orders during their dreams.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the personal agent of Emperor [[Aetheric III]] of [[Doegan]], the [[Mar]] [[psion]] chancellor [[Ikavi Garkim]] managed to defeat single-handedly a cell based in his old quarter in [[Eldrinpar]].\n\nDespite it being his doing, Emperor Aetheric III convinced the group of paladins led by [[Miltiades]] of [[Phlan]] that the culprits behind the abduction of [[Eidola]] of [[Neverwinter]], the soon-to-be wife of [[Piergeiron Paladinson]], were members of the Fallen Temple. Then the emperor asked the paladins to defeat once for all the Fallen Temple, and after a communion with their deity Tyr, they agreed to destroy the enemies of Doegan.\n\nAfterward, [[Artemis Entreri]] and his mercenaries managed to injure Aetheric III and the magical barriers around Eldrinpar failed, flooding the city with fiendish monsters, [[hordeling]]s, and [[tanar'ri]]. Seizing advantage, the cultists managed to steal the ''bloodforge'' of Doeagan and secretly gained control of the [[Temple of Umberlee (Eldrinpar)|Temple of Umberlee]], killing all the local priests there.\n\nThey planned to use the two ''bloodforges'' they had obtained to finally fully summon Ysdar into the Utter East. However they were attacked at the last moment by a mixed group of both paladins and mercenaries. In the process, the deity Tyr revealed himself through his new [[Chosen]]â€”the blind boy mercenary [[Ingrar Welven]]. The deity manifested himself through ominous red skies and collapsed part of the temple's dome. Disgusted by the cult that claimed to be his worshipers, Tyr incinerated many, and forced the survivors to flee."
