The Ambrosi amassed a small army, granting the leader of the House the title of Blade Captain and the privilege to vote in Sumbrias Blade Council.\nIn the , Ugo Svarézi, a disgruntled Blade Captain of the city-state of Colletro, manipulated Colletro and Sumbria into an open and bloody war, orchestrating the destruction of the ruling family, the Manniccis troops and the loss of the ruling familys powers.vThree days later, the Blade Council of Sumbria cast their votes to elect a new Prince, removing disgraced Prince-elect Cappa Mannicci. Loyalist Blade Captain Orlando Toporello disgusted with the Councils opportunism announced House Toporellos withdrawal from Sumbria and returning to its roots as an independent mercenary company. Three smaller Houses followed the old noblemans lead and withdrew from the Blade Council. The Blade Captains of House Ambrosi and House Marello voiced their support for Gilberto Ilégo, the ambitious Blade Captain who planned on takin the throne. Orlando Toporello compared Ambrosi an Marello to a pack of jackals before departing. Momentary after the vote, Cappa Mannicci was assassinated and Sumbria plunged into anarchy, consumed by riots."
