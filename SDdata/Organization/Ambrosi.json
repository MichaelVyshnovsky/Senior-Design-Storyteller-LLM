        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1217}}, [[Ugo Svarézi]], a disgruntled Blade Captain of the city-state of [[Colletro]], manipulated Colletro and [[Sumbria]] into an open and bloody war, orchestrating the destruction of the ruling family, the [[Mannicci]]'s troops and the loss of the ruling family's powers.vThree days later, the Blade Council of Sumbria cast their votes to elect a new Prince, removing disgraced Prince-elect [[Cappa Mannicci]]. Loyalist Blade Captain [[Orlando Toporello]] disgusted with the Council's opportunism announced House [[Toporello]]'s withdrawal from Sumbria and returning to its roots as an independent mercenary company. Three smaller Houses followed the old nobleman's lead and withdrew from the Blade Council. The Blade Captains of House Ambrosi and House [[Marello]] voiced their support for [[Gilberto Ilégo]], the ambitious Blade Captain who planned on takin the throne. Orlando Toporello compared Ambrosi an Marello to a pack of [[jackals]] before departing. Momentary after the vote, Cappa Mannicci was assassinated and Sumbria plunged into anarchy, consumed by riots."
