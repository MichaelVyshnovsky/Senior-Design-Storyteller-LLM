Some of us have arrived here recently from Evermeet, while others come from families who have dwelt here since before the city fell.<br/>Regardless of where we came from originally, everyone in this camp is devoted to reclaiming the ruins and rebuilding Myth Drannor.\n|[[Aelorin Ungive]]}}": "=Base of Operations==",

From there, soldiers and [[adventurer]]s struck into the wider city in search of threats, and artisans began rebuilding the ruins.",

From there, soldiers and [[adventurer]]s struck into the wider city in search of threats, and artisans began rebuilding the ruins.",
        "History": "Following the defeat of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] and the [[phaerimm]] in Myth Drannor, the ruined city was more accessible than any previous time in history.<ref group=\"note\">The Cult of the Dragon and phaerimm are mentioned as past defeated threats, while the daemonfey are not mentioned or depicted at all. As the Elven Crusade is mentioned as ongoing, it seems that the events of the game take place after the formation of the Crusade but before the open appearance of the daemonfey in Myth Drannor. While the Elven Crusade from [[Evermeet]] and [[daemonfey]] of [[Sarya Dlardrageth]] conducted their own plans for the city, the local elves of the Cormanthor began their own effort. They set up a fortified camp on the southern side of the ruins and began methodically exploring and reclaiming the area, already familiar the myriad threats lurking within.\n\nIn addition to the expected [[dead magic]] and [[wild magic]] zones, magically mutated and foreign summoned monsters, and legions of [[undead|unquiet dead]], the Elves of Cormanthor also faced an opportunistic band of [[orc]]s that sought to loot the treasures left by centuries of conflict, the [[Church of Moander|cult]] of [[Moander]], and oddly-aggressive [[ettercap]]s that preyed upon travelers in the [[Spiderhaunt Wood]]. Worst of all, they encountered a bold expedition by the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] led by the [[lich]] [[Droic Orgul]], who sought to pilfer the artifacts and lore of the city and even manipulate the ''mythal''.\n\nIn the midst of being hard-pressed by all these threats, [[Eilistraee's Wanderers]] arrived. These [[drow]] wished to prove themselves by helping reclaim the city, but their eagerness outpaced their sensibility, resulting in several of them (including their leader [[Kelgoth Darksong]]) being lost and trapped in the ruins without the Cormanthor Elves being able to help them.",

It included recent migrants from Evermeet and other places (at least by elven standards), and welcomed the assistance of non-elven participants in their work, like [[Oona Lombin]], [[Jurnau Halbeck]], and [[Hurda Marganir]].
