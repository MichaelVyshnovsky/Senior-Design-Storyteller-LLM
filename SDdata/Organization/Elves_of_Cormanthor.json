        "mainbody": "he Elves of Cormanthor were a group of elves and their allies dedicated towards rebuilding Myth Drannor in the late 14 century DR. They worked alongside the Elven Crusade led by Ilsevele Miritar that ultimately recaptured the city in 1374 DR.\nDuring the reclamation of the city, the Elves of Cormanthor set up a fortified camp on the south side of Glyrryls Pool next to Tilvers Dam. From there, soldiers and adventurers struck into the wider city in search of threats, and artisans began rebuilding the ruins.\nFollowing the defeat of the Cult of the Dragon and the phaerimm in Myth Drannor, the ruined city was more accessible than any previous time in history.The Cult of the Dragon and phaerimm are mentioned as past defeated threats, while the daemonfey are not mentioned or depicted at all. As the Elven Crusade is mentioned as ongoing, it seems that the events of the game take place after the formation of the Crusade but before the open appearance of the daemonfey in Myth Drannor. While the Elven Crusade from Evermeet and daemonfey of Sarya Dlardrageth conducted their own plans for the city, the local elves of the Cormanthor began their own effort. They set up a fortified camp on the southern side of the ruins and began methodically exploring and reclaiming the area, already familiar the myriad threats lurking within.\nIn addition to the expected dead magic and wild magic zones, magically mutated and foreign summoned monsters, and legions of unquiet dead, the Elves of Cormanthor also faced an opportunistic band of orcs that sought to loot the treasures left by centuries of conflict, the cult of Moander, and oddly-aggressive ettercaps that preyed upon travelers in the Spiderhaunt Wood. Worst of all, they encountered a bold expedition by the Red Wizards of Thay led by the lich Droic Orgul, who sought to pilfer the artifacts and lore of the city and even manipulate the mythal.\nIn the midst of being hard-pressed by all these threats, Eilistraees Wanderers arrived. These drow wished to prove themselves by helping reclaim the city, but their eagerness outpaced their sensibility, resulting in several of them (including their leader Kelgoth Darksong) being lost and trapped in the ruins without the Cormanthor Elves being able to help them.\nThe Elves of Cormanthor were largely made up of the local elves of the Cormanthor Forest. It included recent migrants from Evermeet and other places (at least by elven standards), and welcomed the assistance of non-elven participants in their work, like Oona Lombin, Jurnau Halbeck, and Hurda Marganir. They also accepted and worked alongside Eilistraees Wanderers, a group of drow that sought to aid the reclamation of Myth Drannor.\nProminent members included\n* Tannivh Dahast, leader of the group.\n* Emalline Brightbough, camp security officer.\n* Verzan Nuovis, lieutenant.\n* Thiralen Farstep, sergeant.\n* Pilea Skysage, mythal sage.\n* Pyndil Bospin, planar sage.\n* Uramyl Widemeadow, field kitchen cook.\n* Neremyn Proris, historian.\n* Weikko Brightbeam, guide.\n* Emri Aliniki, guide."
