}}House '''Amcathra''' ({{Pronounce|am|CATH|ra|refs=}}) was a distinguished [[Waterdhavian]] [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble house]] that had a long history within the city, dating back to the 12{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|2}}

The [[blade]]s produced by House Amcathra were known to be some of the finest found in the ''City of Splendors'', the reputation of which preceded that of the family.

==Organization==
During the 14{{th}} century, [[Challas Amcathra]] passed on his title as family patriarch to his eldest son, [[Arilos Amcathra|Arilos]]. His consort and wife, [[Miri Amcathra|Miri]], stepped down during this time and heir was passed to Challas' second son, [[Regnet Amcathra|Regnet]].

As of [[1372 DR]], the house had 17 family members.

==Activities==
The Amcathra family were particularly well known for their trade in wine and their enterprises in [[sword]]-forging, [[horse]]-breeding and martial training. Their members were active patrons within the [[Vintners', Distillers', & Brewers' Guild]] as well as the [[Splendid Order of Armorers, Locksmiths, and Finesmiths]].

==Base of Operations==
The family owned a villa in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]], between the east side of the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]] and [[Ilzantil Street]] and between [[Hassantyr's Street]] and [[Tarnath Street]].

They also had holdings in [[Amphail (village)]] and [[Silverymoon]]. 

==History==
The family's history dated back to [[Rorgar Amcathra]], who established a horse ranch near [[Rowan Hold]], shortly after the [[Trollwars|First Trollwar]]. They offered their services as horse-masters to the military of Waterdeep, whose cavalry were greatly depleted during the conflict, and rapidly garnered a fair amount of wealth. In [[1248 DR]], [[Hargrym Amcathra|Lord Hargrym]] accepted the city's offer of ennoblement, along with several other mercantile families, which ascended their status to that of Waterdhavian aristocracy.

Around [[1372 DR]], [[Gralhund|House Gralhund]] began to undercut the sale of Amcathran blades, offering [[weapon]]s that were forged from [[mithral]]-laced-[[steel]] was provided from the [[duergar]] [[Clan Xundorn]], which was highly superior in form and function. [[Arilos Amcathra|Lord Arilos]] suspected they were using an alloy that was unavailable to other smiths, and sought to hire adventurers to rout out the driving force behind their recent success or hopefully attain the source for his own family's use.
