Summerstar was a noble house of Cormyr.
The Summerstars were considered a backwater family in Suzail. Their heraldry was an arc of three golden stars on a field of deep blue.
The Summerstar family had a seat in Firefall Keep, in Firefall Vale, where the Hullack Forest met the western slopes of the Thunder Peaks, in the Northtrees March district. The castle of Firefall Keep was at the western end of Firefall Vale, but it was virtually destroyed and most of its inhabitants were killed in 1365 DR. Turnwyrm Brook flowed down the heart of vale to join the Immerflow.
