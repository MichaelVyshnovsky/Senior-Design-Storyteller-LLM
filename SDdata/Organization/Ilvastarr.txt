The '''Ilvastarr''' family was one of the [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble house]]s of [[Waterdeep]] that rose to prominence during the 13{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|4}}

==Activities==
They owed much of their wealth and success to their prowess and skill as monster catchers. Frescoes in their possession seemingly depicted members of their family subduing and taming fantastic beasts such as [[chimera]]s, [[manticore]]s, [[giant snake]]s, and even [[dragon]]s. 

Interestingly enough, their family owned culinary interests that specialized in meats of an "exotic" flavor.

==Base of Operations==
They kept their family estate within the city's [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] at the southwest corner of [[Saerdoun Street]] and [[Suldown Street]].

In addition to their familial home, the Ilvastarrs maintained a secret vault somewhere in the city. Within it were the family's historical records, the remains of their forebears, and a number of familial relics including the ''[[Bulwark of Ilvastarr]]''. It was guarded by a [[spectator]] known as [[Qilnax]].

==History==
The family has a storied history in Waterdeep and its surrounding lands, even before their ennoblement in the {{YearlinkName|1248}}.

Members of the family were present during the [[Battle of Blood-Drenched Swords]] of the [[Second Trollwar]]. Following the defeat of the [[Black Claw]] horde, members of the Ilvastarr family looted the corpse of [[Palinor Belabranta|Lord Palinor Belabranta]] and stole the ''[[griffontack of Belabranta]]'' from his [[griffon]] mount.

During the [[Guild Wars]] of the 1250s [[DR]], [[Haran Ilvastarr|Lord Haran]] of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] pulled his watchmen from the streets, allowing members of an allied family to destroy the estate of [[Zoar|House Zoar]]. He was put to trial by the Lords-Magister and killed for the abdication of his responsibilities.
