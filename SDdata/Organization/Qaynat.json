        "mainbody": "The Qaynat was a group of beautiful and talented women gathered by the fourth Grand Caliph of Zakhara, the Land of Fate.\nObsessed with beauty, the fourth Grand Caliph filled his harim with physically dazzling women who were also skilled musicians and behaved in a proper courtly manner. Though the women of the Qaynat were technically slaves, they wanted for nothing. It was widely believed that their collective beauty had not been matched in any other harim in Zakhara."
