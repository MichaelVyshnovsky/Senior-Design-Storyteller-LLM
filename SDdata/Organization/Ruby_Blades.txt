The '''Ruby Blades''' were a [[Sembite]] [[adventurer|adventuring]] company that operated ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Ruby Blades were summoned by their allies, the [[Wolfmasters]], to join them in a dangerous expedition into the [[Vast Swamp]] to loot [[Orvaskyte Keep]]. The Ruby Blades were delayed, and by the time they arrived the Wolfmasters had been slain by a [[cornugon]] [[devil]]. Running into [[Cormyr]]ean adventurers sent by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] to find the Wolfmasters, the Ruby Blades abandoned the Orvaskyte Keep mission, instead turning to hunting a local [[black dragon]]. Utterly outclassed, they fled with the dragon in pursuit, only to be saved by the Cormyrean adventurers. They were then reinforced by two-dozen Sembian mercenaries, and went on to secure Orvaskyte Keep for their own delving.

==Known Ruby Blades==
* [[Ranni Stalkersdaughter]], co-leader and [[ranger]].
* [[Pyrra Flamedancer]], co-leader and [[wizard]].
* [[Arpeggi Trill]], a dramatic [[bard]].
* [[Dendir Abbathorson]], a [[dwarf]] [[rogue]].
* [[Zurk the Looney]], an insane [[fighter]].
