The Quiet Multitude was a religious organization in Zakhara whose members followed the teachings of Selan, the Zakharan goddess of beauty.
The Quiet Multitude did not have a favored weapon or symbol.
Mystics of the Quiet Multitude worshiped Selan by meditating under the moonlight. As of 1367 DR, there were dozens of sub-sects of the Quiet Multitude across Zakhara, each with their own unique way of worshiping the goddess. The different sects usually did not get along with each other.
Beginning in the mid 1200s DR, the Quiet Multitude rapidly spread throughout all of Zakhara, creating unique sects within every major city on the continent.
