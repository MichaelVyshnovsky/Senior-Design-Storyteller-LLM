'''Rendi''' {{pronounce|REN|dee}}, '''Renjie''' {{pronounce|REN|jee|eh}}, and '''Renmei''' {{pronounce|REN|may}}, known collectively as the '''Ren Brothers''', were a trio of masters of the [[Way of the Open Hand]] in [[Shou Lung]]. They developed tools for attaining immortality and compiled their knowledge in ''[[The Book of Inner Alchemy]]''.<ref group="note">The actual origin of the Ren Brothers and the ''The Book of Inner Alchemy'' is not stated in ''Candlekeep Mysteries'', but given the Chinese theme, the close association with the Way of the Open Hand, and the great age, this article assumes it to be Shou Lung.<ref group="note">By [[Wikipedia:Chinese name|Chinese naming conventions]] and the inspiration from the Shaw Brothers, "Ren-" appears to be a given name, not a family name, suggesting that "Ren Brothers" is more of a nickname for their shared similar names. Moreover, they might not necessarily be blood-relative brothers, but sworn brothers.

==History==
Over the course of their long lives, the three masters developed the Open Hand further, transforming its martial arts techniques into tools for attaining immortality. However, to do this, the Ren Brothers carried out gruesome experiments on captured animals and people for their research and development, producing rituals for fashioning [[magic item]]s and [[magic weapon]]s to enhance combat prowess and shortcut the process of becoming immortal. The most terrible item was the ''[[gloves of soul catching]]'', which required the sacrifice of three great people to craft and their [[necromantic]] power permitted one to drain life from others; this at least was only a theory they never tried to actually make. They compiled their research and discoveries in ''The Book of Inner Alchemy'' and kept it to themselves.

Regardless, rumors of an ancient book holding the secrets of immortality through martial arts spread through the martial world and the Ren Brothers expected many would come hunting for it. Although conflicted in their need to preserve their knowledge and their guilt of using it, and fearing the chaos such knowledge would cause in the world, the Ren Brothers placed it in the immense [[Candlekeep]] library, on the [[Sword Coast]] of [[Faer√ªn]] on the far side of the continent, hidden and forgotten amongst countless other books. Exactly when it first appeared in the library was lost to history, but it remained there for centuries and was known to be one of the oldest works there by the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].
