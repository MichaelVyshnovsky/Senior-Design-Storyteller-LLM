Silvershield was a powerful patriar family of Baldurs Gate.
Fabulously wealthy, the Silvershields lived a life of extravagant luxury as they subtly worked their influence on the political scene of Baldurs Gate.
Silvershield estate, located on the western edge of the Upper City, was considered the grandest of all the citys noble manors.
The Silvershield family rose to prominence at some point in the 1300s DR. Before long, they were represented on Baldurs Gates Council of Four, a tradition that went on nearly unbroken until the late 15 century.
