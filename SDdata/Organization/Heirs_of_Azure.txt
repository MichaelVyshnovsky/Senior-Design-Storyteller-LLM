The '''Heirs of Azure''' was an organization that emerged in [[Helm's Hold]] during the late 15{{th}} century to combat the growing anti-[[spellscarred]] sentiment that was pervasive among its citizens. Depending on perspective, the group was considered to be a city gang, a revolutionary political movement, and even a cult by some.

==Organization==
The Heirs of Azure was led by the charismatic [[Neverwintan]] landowner, [[Halas]]. He formed the group to combat the "bigotry of the purebloods" against his fellow spellscarred.

==Activities==
The members of the movement took to the streets to physically stop the discriminatory practices taken by many citizens of Helm's Hold.

==Tactics==
While the Heirs of Azure still had advocates for peace within its group, their methods of protest became more and more violent over time.

==Base of Operations==
The organization was based in the [[Hungry Flame]] tavern.

==Relationships==
For a long time the Heirs of Azure allied themselves with the Prophet Rohini, a leader of the [[Helmite]] clergy that championed the cause of the spellscarred. The more radicalized members of the group believed she only had words to offer the cause and refused to take the action necessary to affect real change.

==History==
The Heirs of Azure was formed by Halas some time during the 1470s [[DR]], after Helm's Hold suffered a riot cause by anti-spellscarred sentiment. Their original aim was to offer their kind some means of protection while merely living in the city. They appeared to reach the peak of their influence some time around or before the {{YearlinkName|1479}}.

The movement was abandoned by Halas when the Prophet Rohini revealed herself to be an agent of the [[Ashmadai]]. The [[succubus]] offered to "purify" him of his spellscars in exchange for his soul and the promise to bring over converts from among his followers. The fellow Heirs of Azure that followed the newly-named Halas the Pure were brought into the Ashmadai [[devil]] cult and used as pawns by their Prophet.

==Members==
* [[Halas]], the founder of the group that promoted taking violent action when necessary.
* [[Meryth Heartwood]], an advocate for peaceful resistance against the Hold's discriminatory actions.
