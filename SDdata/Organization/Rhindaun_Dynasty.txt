Rhindaun Dynasty was one of the ruling dynasties of Tethyr, founded by the adventuress Zaranda Star Rhindaun.
The dynasty took its name from King-Consort Haedraks mother, Rhinda, second wife of Alemander V.
The dynasty was officially founded in 1368 DR. After Zaranda Star won the Reclamation Wars and married the lost prince of Tethyr, Haedrak Rhindaun III, her official coronation was in 1369 DR.
The full line of succession for the dynasty is unknown, but Queen Zarandas first daughter Sybille succeeded her as the second queen of the line. Later rulers in the Rhindaun dynasty were Queen Cyriana and King Errilam, and Queen Anais, who ruled as early as 1468 DR and at least as late as 1489 DR. Sybilles niece Princess Jemra Rhindaun married into the Obarskyr dynasty of Cormyr in 1430 DR.
