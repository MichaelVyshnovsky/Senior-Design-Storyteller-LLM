The '''White Sails''' company was the preeminent supplier of mercenaries&mdash;both soldiers and [[ship]]s&mdash;operating out of [[Mintarn]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 1}}

==Activities==
White Sails ships traveled all across the [[Sea of Swords]] and along the [[Sword Coast]] for work, taking jobs from [[Neverwinter]] to [[Elturel]] and sometimes working for other mercenary groups like the [[Flaming Fist]] of [[Baldur's Gate]].{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 2}}

==Relationships==
[[Dagult Neverember]] invested heavily in the White Sails company as part of his broader efforts to invest in Mintarn, which included creating a ship-building company and combat training facilities on the island. 

The company was on good terms with [[Janolus Fuscus]], a [[goblin]] captain of a [[submersible]] called the ''[[Nudibranch]]'', who trawled the waters between the [[Moonshae Isles]] and Mintarn.

==History==
Dagult Neverember's investment in the White Sails company began prior to his ascension to [[Open Lord]] of [[Waterdeep]], and with his backing, it grew to become the premier exporter of Mintarn muscle to the Sword Coast. As part of his "[[New Neverwinter]]" movement, he used such mercenaries to patrol the streets, defend his interests, and enforce militaristic order within the city.

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, White Sails was famous enough that young [[adventurer]]s from as far afield as [[Norland]] in the Moonshae Isles sought to join. The company was so popular that [[slaver]]s learned to target aspiring new recruits from outside Mintarn by promising to induct them into the company. 

The company retained its reputation through the {{YearlinkName|1489}},{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 3}}

Members were sailors who were grouped by the ship on which they were assigned to serve.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 1}} Membership was diverse, including not only [[human]]s from Mintarn and beyond but also [[elves]], [[dragonborn]], [[kenku]], and more. It attracted all manner of adventurers seeking to travel the world, ranging from [[rogue]]s and [[fighter]]s to [[warlock]]s and [[wizard]]s.{{Cite comic/A Darkened Wish 2}}
