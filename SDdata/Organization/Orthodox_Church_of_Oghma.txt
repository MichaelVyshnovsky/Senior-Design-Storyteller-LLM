The Orthodox Church of Oghma referred to a prominent group of Oghmas faithful who branched from the Church of Oghma during the Time of Troubles.
The Orthodoxy was based in Cormyr.
During the Time of Troubles, Cullen Kordamant, who was the Grand Patriarch of Oghma, disappeared from his home in Procampur without a trace. Prayers to Oghma about his wherabouts resulted in conflicting information. Two separate theories evolved about what happened to him. Some believed that the Grand Patriarch perished so a replacement needed to be selected. The Orthodox Churchs stance was that the Grand Patriach was still out there alive and well somewhere, and until information was presented proving his demise, he would continue to serve as the Grand Patriarch even though he was not present. The Orthodoxy eventually stated that Cullen had risen to a state of semi-divinity and continued to serve Oghma, and would remain the Grand Patriarch until Oghma said otherwise.
