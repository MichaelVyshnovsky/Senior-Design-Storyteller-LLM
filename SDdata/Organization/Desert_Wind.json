They were ruled by Sheik Ar-Rabi, who was served by his lieutenants Yasir and Mabad. Abu Jafar, a priest of Cyric, and Al-Warrakh, a wizard, aided the Sheik on raids.\nThe Grinning Skull oasis served as their base of operations.\nThe Desert Wind raided the scattered tribes of the Plains of Purple Dust and southern Murghôm.\nBandits of the Desert Wind would force prisoners, and even lizards, to drink from the dangerous pools of the Grinning Skull until they discovered which pool was safe to drink from on that particular day."
