The '''Circle of Greater Powers''', also known as the '''Circle of Twelve Powers''', was the coalition of twelve [[Greater Power]]s of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]]. These mighty beings directed the actions of their fellow [[gods]] to keep and maintain [[the Balance]], in accordance with the will of the [[overgod]] [[Ao]].

==Activities==
The Circle did not hold regular conclaves, but did meet when problems arose that concerned them all.

==Base of Operations==
The twelve greater powers met within the [[Pavilion of Cynosure]] which was set within a unique [[demiplane]] within the greater [[Ethereal plane]].

==History==
At some point in their history, the Circle of Greater Powers banned members of the pantheon from dealing with [[Kezef]] the Chaos Hound. They magically bound the beast within the depths of [[Pandemonium]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the Circle held a series of sessions to discuss and deal with the god [[Cyric]]. Cyric was believed to have slain the goddess [[Leira]] and had created a magical book called the ''[[Cyrinishad]]'', that could convert readers to the [[Cyricist]] faith. [[Tyr]] offered a mere warning to the Mad God, but [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] illegally stripped him of his ability to cast magic.

The Council met once again to address both Cyric's crime of releasing Kezef, and Mystra's unlawful seizure of magic from Cyric. They found that due to the fact each god had recently ascended from mortality, they would be forgiven so long as they made right their offenses. Cyric was directed to participate in the  Circle's meetings and abide by their decisions, and Mystra was forced to restore to Cyric his access to [[the Weave]].

In the end Cyric, continue to work against the gods and eventually faced uprising within his own [[divine realm]]. He blamed the Circle for his own failings and cursed them as his enemies from then onwards.
