Veldorni freedom fighters were various groups of resistance fighters found within various settlements in the Beastlands.
They fought against the rule of the Beast-chieftains in hopes of starting a full-scale rebellion in the region. Many of these groups utilized guerrilla tactics and were actually sponsored by foreign nations, religious faiths and even monstrous rivals of the beast-chieftains.
