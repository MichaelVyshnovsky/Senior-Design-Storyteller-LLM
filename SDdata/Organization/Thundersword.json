The house included a private dock. They held an ancestral seat in [[Immersea]], the newest and biggest castle, aptly named [[Thundersword House]]. It stood outside Immersea proper and could be found in its own valley to the south-west from [[Redstone Castle]], home of the [[Wyvernspur (house)|Wyvernspur]] noble house.\n\nThe family had a home in the capital city of [[Suzail]]. The manor was frequented by [[Chansaera Thundersword]] and inhabited by her uncles [[Nalthar Thundersword|Nalthar]], [[Raien Thundersword|Raien]] , and [[Dunstrar Thundersword|Dunstrar]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Thundersword family participated in royal outings, such as hunts. The family organized their own hunting party to join the Crown of Cormyr in these events. Despite that, Thunderswords were numerous, and their opinions and loyalties to the Crown varied wildly. However, the family never openly confronted the royal family despite their personal opinions.\n\nThe noble house often hired adventuring companies to perform various tasks for them. Some of these adventurers were four exiled family members, one female, and three males. As of the late 14{{th}} century DR, all four were in their twenties and already experienced and capable adventurers. They traveled far from home and could be found in [[Waterdeep]], the [[Vilhon Reach]], [[Amn]], and the [[Tashalar]].\n\nThunderswords never faced extortion or blackmail as the family had no dark secrets nor skeletons in their closets.",
        "History": "Following the [[Devil Dragon War]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, against [[Nalavarauthatoryl]] the Red, many members of the House Thundersword perished; however, that did not affect their numbers much as the family of many branches was quite numerous. [[Feldrath Thundersword]] became the patriarch of his house after the war. Feldrath was an old man of poor memory and a frail physique. He spent most of his time in his bedchambers and was unlikely to have survived long into the 1370s DR. His much younger wife [[Tananthra Thundersword]] was the true ruler at the time. The strong-willed woman had a sharp tongue and good looks for a woman of her age who was a keen strategist and a master of playing the country games among nobles and forged strong alliances.\n\nFeldrath and Tananthra Thundersword sired a son and three daughters. One of them was likely to take the reigns from her parents when the time came. [[Maurara Thundersword]] was the most among her sisters, like her mother and the likely successor. Chansaera Thundersword had a small army of paramours and admirers among the nobles and commoners of Cormyr. [[Delphaera Thundersword]] was a steeled warrior and a master horseback rider and hunter who was believed to eventually outdo [[Alusair Obarskyr]] in those skills. The youngest of the siblings was [[Teltristram Thundersword]], a young man who stove for arts and quill rather than games of the nobles. He disliked using his family name and was likely to have moved to [[Waterdeep]] or [[Sembia]] to pursue his passions.",
