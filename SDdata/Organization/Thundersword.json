        "mainbody": "Thundersword was a noble house of Cormyr.\nThe family owned Thundersword villa, or Swordspires, palatial home in Marsember that was purchased from the Aurubaen house. The house included a private dock. They held an ancestral seat in Immersea, the newest and biggest castle, aptly named Thundersword House. It stood outside Immersea proper and could be found in its own valley to the south-west from Redstone Castle, home of the Wyvernspur noble house.\nThe family had a home in the capital city of Suzail. The manor was frequented by Chansaera Thundersword and inhabited by her uncles Nalthar, Raien , and Dunstrar in the late 14 century DR.\nThundersword family participated in royal outings, such as hunts. The family organized their own hunting party to join the Crown of Cormyr in these events. Despite that, Thunderswords were numerous, and their opinions and loyalties to the Crown varied wildly. However, the family never openly confronted the royal family despite their personal opinions.\nThe noble house often hired adventuring companies to perform various tasks for them. Some of these adventurers were four exiled family members, one female, and three males. As of the late 14 century DR, all four were in their twenties and already experienced and capable adventurers. They traveled far from home and could be found in Waterdeep, the Vilhon Reach, Amn, and the Tashalar.\nThunderswords never faced extortion or blackmail as the family had no dark secrets nor skeletons in their closets.\nFollowing the Devil Dragon War in the , against Nalavarauthatoryl the Red, many members of the House Thundersword perished however, that did not affect their numbers much as the family of many branches was quite numerous. Feldrath Thundersword became the patriarch of his house after the war. Feldrath was an old man of poor memory and a frail physique. He spent most of his time in his bedchambers and was unlikely to have survived long into the 1370s DR. His much younger wife Tananthra Thundersword was the true ruler at the time. The strong-willed woman had a sharp tongue and good looks for a woman of her age who was a keen strategist and a master of playing the country games among nobles and forged strong alliances.\nFeldrath and Tananthra Thundersword sired a son and three daughters. One of them was likely to take the reigns from her parents when the time came. Maurara Thundersword was the most among her sisters, like her mother and the likely successor. Chansaera Thundersword had a small army of paramours and admirers among the nobles and commoners of Cormyr. Delphaera Thundersword was a steeled warrior and a master horseback rider and hunter who was believed to eventually outdo Alusair Obarskyr in those skills. The youngest of the siblings was Teltristram Thundersword, a young man who stove for arts and quill rather than games of the nobles. He disliked using his family name and was likely to have moved to Waterdeep or Sembia to pursue his passions.\n14th Century\n* Harandil Thundersword, one of the knights who rode with Princess Alusair Obarskyr in the mid-14 century DR.\n* Indyn Thundersword, one of the highknights who served Queen Filfaeril Obarskyr in the 14 century DR.\n* Ondryn Thundersword, a bastard son of Azoun Obarskyr IV.\n* Ondyn Thundersword, Knight Royal and personal bodyguard of Filfaeril Obarskyr in the mid-14th Century \n* Talados Thundersword, a royal bastard with claims to the throne of cormyr in the late 14 century DR.\n15th Century\n* Sulue Thundersword, a late 15 century DR member of house Thundersword that was revealed to be an agent of Shar"
