'''Handmaidens of the Spider Queen''', also known as the '''Daughters of the Yochlol''', was an all-female order of [[Lolthite]] [[crusader]]s.

==Activities==
This organization acted as the instrument of [[Lolth]]'s will. They typically operated in small companies that were scattered throughout the [[Underdark]], harassing merchant trains that viewed [[Vhaeraun]] as their protector and conducting hit-and-run raids on cities that were ruled by the clergy of Vhaeraun or [[Ghaunadaur]].

On rare occasions they were assembled together into an army to bring Lolth-worshiping cities into line.

==Base of Operations==
The members of this organization had no permanent ties to any specific city.

==History==
Throughout the history of this organization, there were at least three known incidences in which they caused the destruction of a [[drow]] city that was drifting away from the worship of Lolth.
