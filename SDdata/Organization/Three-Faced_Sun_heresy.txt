The '''Three-Faced Sun heresy''' was the belief that [[the sun]] was an [[overgod|overdeity]]. According to this [[heresy]], this overdeity had a total of three [[aspect]]s out of which two were eligible as objects of worship by mortals in the form of [[deity|deities]].

==Dogma==
Believers in this [[heresy]] claimed that [[Amaunator]] and [[Jergal]] were the aspects of [[Hours of the day|highsun]] and dusk respectively during the days of [[Netheril]]. Later, these positions were fulfilled by [[Lathander]], as the aspect of dawn, and [[Myrkul]], as the aspect of dusk. After the [[Time of Troubles]], the Morninglord, according to this heresy, experienced a time of unchallenged authority.

A substantial number of believers in this heresy claimed in [[1374 DR]] that the Morninglord was close to transforming into the Yellow God. However, a minority believed that Lathander was about to take over the position as the highsun aspect, essentially handing over the dawn position to another deity, while another minority believed that a completely different god would ascend to take over the position as the highsun aspect.

==Powers==
[[Cleric]]s who believed in this heresy were capable of accessing the [[Death domain|Death]], [[Law domain|Law]], [[Renewal domain|Renewal]], [[Sun domain|Sun]], and [[Time domain]]s. They could use both the [[light mace]] and the [[scythe]] as their [[favored weapon]] and could add the ''[[flaming]]'' quality to either of them on casting ''[[weapon of the deity]]''.
