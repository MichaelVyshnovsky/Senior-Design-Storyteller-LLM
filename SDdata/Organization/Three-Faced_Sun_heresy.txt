The Three-Faced Sun heresy was the belief that the sun was an overdeity. According to this heresy, this overdeity had a total of three aspects out of which two were eligible as objects of worship by mortals in the form of deities.
Believers in this heresy claimed that Amaunator and Jergal were the aspects of highsun and dusk respectively during the days of Netheril. Later, these positions were fulfilled by Lathander, as the aspect of dawn, and Myrkul, as the aspect of dusk. After the Time of Troubles, the Morninglord, according to this heresy, experienced a time of unchallenged authority.
A substantial number of believers in this heresy claimed in 1374 DR that the Morninglord was close to transforming into the Yellow God. However, a minority believed that Lathander was about to take over the position as the highsun aspect, essentially handing over the dawn position to another deity, while another minority believed that a completely different god would ascend to take over the position as the highsun aspect.
Clerics who believed in this heresy were capable of accessing the Death, Law, Renewal, Sun, and Time domains. They could use both the light mace and the scythe as their favored weapon and could add the flaming quality to either of them on casting weapon of the deity.
