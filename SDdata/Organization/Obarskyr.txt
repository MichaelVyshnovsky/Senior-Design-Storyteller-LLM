==History==
The Obarskyr family originally rose to prominence in [[Impiltur]] as a mercenary company.

One member of the family, [[Ondeth Obarskyr|Ondeth]], fleeing the political situation and plague in his homeland, took his wife and two sons to a forest to the west of [[Marsember]] known as the [[Wolf Woods]] in the {{YearlinkName|6}}, and built a settlement. More men joined him and when the [[elves]] in the region realized they could not contain the growing number of [[human]]s invading the land they chose Ondeth to attempt to bring peace and slow down the settlement's expansion. When Ondeth died, his son Faerlthann became the first king of the realm that the elves and Ondeth had created. In the {{YearlinkName|26}} (year 1 of [[Marking the years|Cormyr Reckoning]]), Cormyr was born.
