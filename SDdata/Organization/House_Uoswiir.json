        "History": "House Uoswiir was virtually destroyed sometime before the late 14{{th}} century DR, after which only [[Vhaidra Uoswiir]] â€“ the house's heir and her half-sister [[Ulua]] remained alive. According to Ulua's and Vhaidra's father, House Uoswiir was too powerful to be taken down in a direct conflict by any one house; because of that, several enemy houses banded together and purchased the services of the [[Dark Ravens]], a splinter esoteric assassin order of the [[Black Raven Monastery]]. The assassins attacked and slaughtered almost all of the Uoswiir. Ulua was spared, being a half-breed, and Vhaidra escaped the [[Underdark]] alive.\n\nFor some time, Ulua was unsure if her sister survived the fall of House Uoswiir, receiving conflicting reports from her contacts. Subsequently, Ulua reconnected with Vhaidra, who took to the adventuring life and planned vengeance on the heads of her family's enemies. During that time, Ulua conducted operations to regroup surviving House Uoswiir allies and plotted to eliminate its rivals.\n\nWith Vhaidra's financing of the operation, Ulua eventually learned the location of the [[Dark Raven Monastery]]. Vhaidra stormed this monastery and found its archimandrite, [[Draezen Direhand]]. He dismissed Ulua on the grounds that she was only of half-Uoswiir blood and said that House Uoswiir would die with Vhaidra. Once the half-sister returned to Baldur's Gate victorious, Ulua informed her that she had already sent agents to destroy the monastery, having heard of her success and that, when Vhaidra was ready to take up her place as head of the Uoswiir household, she would not stand alone."
