The Proudfists was a tribe of half-orcs that lived on the Sword Coast North during the late 15 century DR.
As of the late 1470s DR, the Proudfists lived in bondage to the Many-Arrows kingdom of full-blooded orcs, but they suffered under their cruel and oppressive rule.
The leader of the tribe was a particularly strong half-orc named Hulgen. Despite his role as the tribes leader, Hulgen was forced to report to an overseer of the Many-Arrows, and ultimately served Vansi Bloodscar.
In the , the Proudfist tribe was among the orcish forces that occupied the ruined River District of Neverwinter.
Despite this, the Neverwintan mage Riftel Farsight felt they could be persuaded to side with Neverwinter over the Many-Arrows and wanted to begin a parlay with Hulgen. However, she felt her shyness dealing with them made her appear weak and distrusted, so she requested a half-elf adventurer to find and negotiate with them. But for them to gain the trust of the Proudfist tribe, they had to successfully pass a series of trials proving they had strength, guile, and wisdom and thus were worthy. Chalik, however, claimed to have already had a vision of the adventurer and believed they would guide the Proudfists on a journey that would bring them prosperity beyond what they ever thought possible. They reported their change of allegiance to Captain Janros of the Neverwinter Guard. Satisfied, Hulgen asked the adventurer to join them in battle as they rose up against their Many-Arrows overseer. After that, Hulgen would bring his tribe to Neverwinters aid.
