The Overlord known as the [[Spinner of Shadows]], long trapped in [[Spinner's Prison|her prison]], was actually an independent fragment of the [[demon]]-goddess [[Lolth]]. The capricious and ambitious Queen of Spiders set forth a plot that would increase her power, albeit at the expense of Eberron's existence.\n\nThe cult devoted to the Spinner of Shadows had a [[Cult safehouse (Stormreach)|safehouse]] in the harbor of the city of [[Stormreach]]. Within, they gathered their forces and performed sacrifices to their dark mistress, commanded by the rakshasa [[Gnomon]] and the drow [[Karas]]. Their activities drew the attention of the [[Silver Flame]]'s forces, who had been infiltrated by the Gnomon in the guise of a trusted inquisitor. He personally led a team of local [[adventurer]]s and the novice [[Corin Dryden]] into the hideout and betrayed them, but his victims managed to fight their way out of the trap and destroyed much of the cult. Gnomon and Karas met the interlopers at their shrine to the Spinner of Shadows, only to be cut down as well.\n\n[[File:Spinner release.jpg|300px|thumb|''The Spinner was freed by overly-optimistic rakshasas.'']]\nKaras's death proved to be the final sacrifice needed to activate the great ritual that they had been working towards—a long tunnel into the depths of Khyber was blasted open in the nearby harbor, allowing nearly direct access to the Spinner's Prison. Even as the Silver Flame began their investigation into this new problem, the Lords of Dust were at work undoing the wards and protections laid upon the Prison. In the process, they also began harvesting the [[dragonshard]]s that lined the caverns.\n\nBy the time the Silver Flame forces caught up with the Lords of Dust, they had already breached the Prison and were at work freeing the Spinner of Shadows. They used the captured dragonshards that they had looted to weaken the bonds upon the demonic lord, with only the [[Silver Flame Guardian]] of the Prison holding it at bay. At the moment that they loosened the bindings, the rakshasas implored the Spinner to turn its power to freeing the other Overlords, but the Spinner simply laughed and slew them, announcing her allegiance to Lolth alone.\n\n[[File:Demonweb Pits Eberron portal.jpg|300px|thumb|''As her portal to Eberron grew, the Lords of Dust would be devoured or enslaved by Lolth.'']]\n{{Quote\n|The Lords of Dust in that pitiful realm of Khyber thought they could share power.
