        "mainbody": "ouse Xorlarrin was a drow house formerly of Menzoberranzan.  It had been considered the \"most magical\" house of that city. The entire house relocated to QXorlarrin in Gauntlgrym in 1484 DR.\nHouse Xorlarrin was based in Spelltower Xorlarrin, located on the plateau of Quellarzorl. A slender spire, the walls were striped in permanent and ever-shifting faerie fire, with battlements set atop its high walls.\nThe house was famous for its wizards, even giving the males status near to the females, meaning they were one of the few groups that did not fit the paradigm of drow males in Menzoberranzan. Matron Mother Zeerith would even listen to the men, as she relied more on advisors than other matriarchs. The wizards had more arcane power than any other house, and those who had no skill would not survive childhood.\nAfter the Spellplague, magic users of House Xorlarrin were known as \"spellspinners\" and utilized a different form of magic from those who practiced before the Spellplague.\nBy 1372 DR, House Xorlarrin was the fifth house. It was the primary assailant on House Agrach Dyrr after that houses betrayal of the city to the Jaezred Chaulssin and duergar armies during the Siege of Menzoberranzan.\nBy the late 15th century DR, Xorlarrin had reached the position of third house of Menzoberranzan.\nIn 1463 DR, House Xorlarrin divined information from a private conversation between the brothers Jarlaxle and Gromph Baenre when the former was investigating the Dawn Titan (primordial) imprisoned in Gauntlgrym. However, with the appointment of Tiago Baenre to the expedition, it was understood that House Xorlarrin would be permitted by Matron Quenthel Baenre to form a new city, so long as it served the Spider Queen.\nIn 1484 DR, House Xorlarrin was finally permitted to leave Menzoberranzan and form a new city in Gauntlgrym called QXorlarrin, where they produced fine weapons at the Forge. They were obligated to trade with and pay tribute to Menzoberranzan and serve in House Baenres army if called upon. In light of the houses departure, Quenthel Baenre restored House DoUrden with a number of drow nobles (and later non-drow) and made it a member of the Ruling Council.\nSlaves and soldiers of House Xolarrin mined Lustrum, a rich mithral mine 20 miles from the Pillars of Woe in the direction of Menzoberranzan. It was abandoned by 1372 DR.\nFrom 1463 DR onward, House Xorlarrin possessed the Forge and much of Gauntlgrym, where they created fine weapons to export to Menzoberranzan.\n Atatlab Xorlarrin  One of the houses sentries in 1372 DR (known by name to Zeerith).\n Belween The second \"bastard son\" of Berellip.\n Berellip Xorlarrin  Daughter of Matron Mother Zeerith.\n Brackthal Xorlarrin  Firstborn son of Matron Mother Zeerith and Horroodissomoth, father and half-brother of Ravel.\n Chenraya Xorlarrin  Priestess who attempted to steal arambarium ore from Akan√ªl.\n Faelas Xorlarrin  Master of Sorcere.\n Horroodissomoth Xorlarrin  House wizard and patron.
