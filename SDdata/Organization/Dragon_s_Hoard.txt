The '''Dragon's Hoard''' was an independent trade organization that operated throughout the [[Underdark]].  The majority (if not all) of its members were worshipers of [[Vhaeraun]].

==Activities==
The Dragon's Hoard was well known in [[Menzoberranzan]] as an organization that could procure anything, no matter the cost. They were particularly valued for their discretion (such as when they stole a white [[rothe]] from [[House Zinard]] in [[Ched Nasad]] to sell to [[House Hunzrin]] in Menzoberranzan). They provided [[Kharza-Kzad Xorlarrin]] with [[spellbook]]s and forbidden books from the surface.

The band was involved with the slave trade of drow children in [[Skullport]].

==Base of Operations==
The group's primary base was located near [[Skullport]] until it was destroyed in [[1361 DR]] by [[Eilistraee]]ans and their allies. Additional bases were located in [[Menzoberranzan]] and [[Ched Nasad]].

The group also had a surface enclave in the [[High Forest]] devoted to furthering the cause of the god Vhaeraun. Its inhabitants were mostly male drow runaways and rogues. In [[1361 DR]], there were few females: two drow, [[silver elf]] outcasts, and a harem of other surface elves There were a handful of children, mostly half-drow/half-surface-elf, although there was one half-drow/half-human child. Nisstyre considered the dearth of drow females a significant problem and always had his eyes out for ways to increase the female drow population of his group.

==Leadership==
The group was led by [[Nisstyre]] until he was killed during the attack upon his base near Skullport in [[1361 DR]]. but in any case it did not survive long in Menzoberranzan or Ched Nasad.

==History==
The group was founded by Nisstyre, a wizard from Ched Nasad who resented the matriarchal society of his city and ended up finding a cause to live and work for in [[Vhaeraun]].

Around [[1361 DR]], the Dragon's Hoard located the magical home of [[Merdrith]] the [[Red Wizard]] in [[Rashemen]]. They raided the home for magical artifacts, running into [[Fyodor]], a [[Berserker (Rashemi)|berserker]] who had located and retrieved the [[Windwalker (artifact)|Windwalker]] amulet (which had been stolen from the [[Witches of Rashemen]]) from the same home. The drow obtained the amulet and attempted to return to Menzoberranzan, but they were attacked and killed by [[deep bats]]. [[Liriel Baenre]] found the corpses of the dead drow and took the amulet, a fact later learned by Nisstyre, who used his band to attempt to retrieve it, to the loss of several of his group's members.

In his search, the Menzoberranyr priestess [[Shakti Hunzrin]] allied with him, agreeing to become a "traitor-priestess" worshiping both [[Lolth]] and Vhaeraun. In order to better work with Nisstyre, she placed a [[ruby]] [[scrying crystal]] in his forehead, through which she could see and hear what Nisstyre did.

Later, [[Eilistraee]]ans from the [[Promenade of the Dark Maiden]], with the help of Liriel, Fyodor, and the [[deep dragon]] [[Zz'Pzora]], assaulted the Dragon's Hoard base outside Skullport, effectively shutting it down in order to hamper the group's involvement in the slave trade of drow children. The Dragon's Hoard had recruited the help of [[Pharx]], another deep dragon, but he was killed by Zz'Pzora.

After Nisstyre's death, his son Gorlist, hired the [[deathsinger]] [[Brindlor Zidorion]] to help avenge his father against Liriel.
