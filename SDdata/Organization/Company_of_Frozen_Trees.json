        "mainbody": "The '''Company of Frozen Trees''' was an adventuring band active in the early 11{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1013}}, the Company of Frozen Trees was joined by a [[bard]] named [[Gallow Deely]]. He played an [[enchanted]] instrument made by a [[hin]] master, [[Relias Blackseed]], called ''[[The Cittern of War]]''. It aided the adventurers with its inspiring magic in battling a young [[green dragon]]. This deed was commemorated in a ballad called ''[[The Fight of Green Thirteen]]'', penned by Gallow. The song remained popular in the taverns of [[west Faerûn]] into the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
