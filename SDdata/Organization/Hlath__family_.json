        "History": "By the late 15{{th}} century DR, Hlaths were considered to be social climbers who made their fortune in the Upper and the [[Lower City]] real estate. Among the many taverns and cafes they owned were the [[Elfsong Tavern]], [[the Singing Lute]], [[Stormshore Row]], as well as owned part of the [[Blushing Mermaid]] as its silent partner. By the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the family was led by its aging patriarch – Lord [[Orthagon Hlath]], but ''de facto'' leadership laid in the hands of his business-savvy daughter, Matron [[Merrigold Hlath]]. The Hlath family was among those targeted by the [[Cult of the Absolute]] and one of its leaders, [[Lord Gortash]]. He identified [[Holiday Hlath]] as being the vulnerable family member. The woman was the favorite grand-neice of Orthagon and his heiress and was an insatiable gambler with debts across all the gambling dens between [[Stonyeyes]] and [[Sow's Foot]].",
