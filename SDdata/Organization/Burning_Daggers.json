        "mainbody": "The Burning Daggers were a fanatical Kossuth-worshiping group of orcs in Thar.\nEach of them was branded in the center of the face with a dagger symbol as a sign of devotion.\nThey inhabited deep caverns in Thar, around twenty miles from Glister, where there was a rift to the Elemental Plane of Fire, into which they threw anyone they took captive. A black flaming dagger floated in the air inside this rift. It had been the focus of many searches by the Black Flame Zealots for a long time.\nThe branding of each orc took place once a year as a sign of devotion to Kossuth. The dagger brand covered the whole of the center of the face, with the point reaching towards the chin and the pommel on the forehead.\nCategoryOrcish organizations\nCategoryReligious organizations\nCategoryOrganizations in Thar\nCategoryOrganizations in North Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryKossuthan organizations\nmp7jqfzfj4a4izmvrxywzt36vehhqu8"
