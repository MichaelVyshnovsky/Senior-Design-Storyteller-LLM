        "orgname": "the Gultoss family",
        "mainbody": "'''Gultoss''' was a [[Nobility of Ravens Bluff|noble family]] of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[1370 DR]].",
        "Organization": "The Gultoss family's main branch operated commercial interests in and around Ravens Bluff, serving on its [[Council of Lords (Ravens Bluff)|Council of Lords]]. Other family members were scattered across [[Faer√ªn]], however, because the Gultoss family produced a number of seafaring [[adventurer]] offspring. Those who survived their adventuring days went on to dwell in places such as [[Amn]], [[Waterdeep]], and various settlements on the [[Lake of Steam]]'s coastline, so Ravens Bluff was home to relatively few Gultossans compared to other families.",
        "Activities": "The Gultoss family were considered one of Ravens Bluff's more reserved noble families. There, they concerned themselves with trade, focusing mainly on shipbuilding, shipping, and fishing. Their investments typically enjoyed little success, however, so they remained rather poor for nobility. Lord Huehm, the liveliest of the Gultossans, was an exception and enjoyed great success as a spice trader specializing in [[cinnamon]], [[nutmeg]], and [[saffron]] from [[Sembia]].",
        "Base of Operations": "[[Gultossan Towers]] was the family's seaside compound north of Ravens Bluff. It featured a keep fortified with a garrison of twenty as well as farmland and fisheries enough to sustain the family, garrison, and a staff of fifty within its walls.\n\n[[Seabreeze Hall]], an ornate house on the east side of [[Lamorgyr's Ride]] in the [[Ravens Bluff/Sixstar|Sixstar]] neighborhood, was the Gultoss family residence in Ravens Bluff.",
        "Relationships": "The Gultoss family counted the financially savvy [[Indemmer]] family among their firm friends.\n\nGultoss also was one of only thirteen families recognized by the [[Zorden]] family as legitimate members of the Council of Lords.",
        "Members": "* [[Ravens Bluff#Nobility|Urgrave]] [[Adelbaert Gultossan]], the head of the family and Amadreil's husband\n* Urgrava [[Amadreil Gultossan]], mother of Breltan and Naekol\n* [[Breltan Gultossan]], son of Adelbaert and Amadreil\n* [[Naekol Gultossan]], son of Amadreil\n* Lord [[Huehm Gultossan]], brother of Adelbaert and rumored to be sire of Naekol",
