        "mainbody": "Gultoss was a noble family of Ravens Bluff in 1370 DR.\nThe Gultoss familys main branch operated commercial interests in and around Ravens Bluff, serving on its Council of Lords. Other family members were scattered across Faer√ªn, however, because the Gultoss family produced a number of seafaring adventurer offspring. Those who survived their adventuring days went on to dwell in places such as Amn, Waterdeep, and various settlements on the Lake of Steams coastline, so Ravens Bluff was home to relatively few Gultossans compared to other families.\nThe Gultoss family were considered one of Ravens Bluffs more reserved noble families. There, they concerned themselves with trade, focusing mainly on shipbuilding, shipping, and fishing. Their investments typically enjoyed little success, however, so they remained rather poor for nobility. Lord Huehm, the liveliest of the Gultossans, was an exception and enjoyed great success as a spice trader specializing in cinnamon, nutmeg, and saffron from Sembia.\nGultossan Towers was the familys seaside compound north of Ravens Bluff. It featured a keep fortified with a garrison of twenty as well as farmland and fisheries enough to sustain the family, garrison, and a staff of fifty within its walls.\nSeabreeze Hall, an ornate house on the east side of Lamorgyrs Ride in the Sixstar neighborhood, was the Gultoss family residence in Ravens Bluff.\nThe Gultoss family counted the financially savvy Indemmer family among their firm friends.\nGultoss also was one of only thirteen families recognized by the Zorden family as legitimate members of the Council of Lords.\n* Urgrave Adelbaert Gultossan, the head of the family and Amadreils husband\n* Urgrava Amadreil Gultossan, mother of Breltan and Naekol\n* Breltan Gultossan, son of Adelbaert and Amadreil\n* Naekol Gultossan, son of Amadreil\n* Lord Huehm Gultossan, brother of Adelbaert and rumored to be sire of Naekol"
