        "mainbody": "he Devout Mamluk Society, also known as the Devout, was a military organization in Zakhara.\nThis mamluk organization was tasked with protecting the prince of Kadarasto, Nari ibn Aman.\nThis group was initially part of the Devoted. They were originally sent with the goal of expanding religious activity in the region, but most of their time and concern was spent protecting the young prince, so the Grand Caliph recognized them as a separate mamluk organization.\nThe Devout were led by Mustah Abd al-Nasik.\nThe Devout were based within the Cities of the Ancients in Kadarasto."
