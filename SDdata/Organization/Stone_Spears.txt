The '''Stone Spears''', or simply the '''Spears''', were the standing army of the city of [[Tulmon]] along the coast of the [[Lake of Steam]] in [[south Faer√ªn]].

==Base of Operations==
The vast majority of soldiers, some 3,650 to be precise, were garrisoned at [[Spearpoint Tower]] along Tulmon's harbor. Several hundred more soldiers were stationed at both the [[Lehrengate]] and [[Bloodarch Gate]].

==Organization==
Most of the Stone Spears were foot soldiers who wore [[chainmail]] and wielded a [[broadsword]] and [[crossbow]]. The Spears were led by the [[Olembarlar]], who was [[Grymmon Borlethgar]] during the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The Spears spent most of their time policing Tulmon and monitoring [[Crypt City]], though they were known to respond slowly to emergencies.
