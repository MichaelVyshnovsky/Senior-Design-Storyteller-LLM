The '''Fraternity of Tharos''' was a fanatical [[demon]]-worshiping cult based in [[New Sarshel]] in [[Impiltur]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The group took its name from the ancient [[Nar]] capital of [[Dun-Tharos]].

==Organization==
The group conducted bloody rituals inside an unmarked gray tower in New Sarshel. Their initiation rites required new members to kidnap innocent victims and then sacrifice them before the [[Demonstone]] which lay in the tower.

==History==
The cult came to prominence sometime after the [[Spellplague]], and terrorized Impiltur. By [[1479 DR]], became the mission of Impiltur's ruling [[Grand Council]] to eliminate the cult,
