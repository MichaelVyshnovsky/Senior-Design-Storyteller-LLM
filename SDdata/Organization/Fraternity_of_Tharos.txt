The Fraternity of Tharos was a fanatical demon-worshiping cult based in New Sarshel in Impiltur as of the late 15 century DR. The group took its name from the ancient Nar capital of Dun-Tharos.
The group conducted bloody rituals inside an unmarked gray tower in New Sarshel. Their initiation rites required new members to kidnap innocent victims and then sacrifice them before the Demonstone which lay in the tower.
The cult came to prominence sometime after the Spellplague, and terrorized Impiltur. By 1479 DR, became the mission of Impilturs ruling Grand Council to eliminate the cult,
