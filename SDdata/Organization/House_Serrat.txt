'''House Serrat''' was a large merchant clan from [[Delzimmer]] that was best known for controlling trade in the drug [[terazul]].{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|642}} Strictly speaking, the family wasn't noble as Delzimmer had no nobility. The family was considered a second-tier merchant house, below the Four Families who ruled Delzimmer.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|609}} 

==Organization==
The clan was divided into three branches:
*Guardians: Spies and enforcers for the family, led by [[Ramul Serrat]].{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|510}} 
*Traders: Managed the family's shipping trade and gambling dens.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|510}} 
*Travelers: Traveled to the jungles south of Delzimmer each summer to harvest terazul blossoms.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|510}} Much of the family's income was derived from the terazul trade.

==Religion==
House Serrat's patron [[deity]] was the goddess [[Waukeen]].{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|1403}}

==Ethics==
House Serrat was somewhat [[neutral]] in ethical outlook.  Although the clan was loyal to its members and retainers the family was not above employing spies and enforcers against its rivals.  The family's main source of wealth was trade in the drug terazul, although they informed users of its side effects.  The family was also known for operating gambling houses.{{Cite digital book/Venom in Her Veins/Kindle|510}}
