House Serrat was a large merchant clan from Delzimmer that was best known for controlling trade in the drug terazul. Strictly speaking, the family wasnt noble as Delzimmer had no nobility. The family was considered a second-tier merchant house, below the Four Families who ruled Delzimmer. 
The clan was divided into three branches
*Guardians Spies and enforcers for the family, led by Ramul Serrat. 
*Traders Managed the familys shipping trade and gambling dens. 
*Travelers Traveled to the jungles south of Delzimmer each summer to harvest terazul blossoms. Much of the familys income was derived from the terazul trade.
House Serrats patron deity was the goddess Waukeen.
House Serrat was somewhat neutral in ethical outlook.  Although the clan was loyal to its members and retainers the family was not above employing spies and enforcers against its rivals.  The familys main source of wealth was trade in the drug terazul, although they informed users of its side effects.  The family was also known for operating gambling houses.
