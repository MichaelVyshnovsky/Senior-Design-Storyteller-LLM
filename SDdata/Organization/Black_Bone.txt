'''Black Bone''' was an [[orc]]ish tribe that inhabited the southern reaches of the [[Fallen Lands]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Possessions==
Like most orc tribes in the Fallen Lands, the members of the Black Bone tribe occasionally rode upon [[axebeak]]s. While doing so, they typically wielded [[lance]]s or [[shortbow]]s.

==Relationships==
More often than not, the members of Black Bone were seen to engage in warfare with the other orcish tribes that inhabited the southern reaches of the Fallen Lands. However, they showed fealty to the [[Bloody Scar]] tribe and their leader [[Ogrash|King Ogrash]], who ruled over the northern reaches of the Fallen Lands.
