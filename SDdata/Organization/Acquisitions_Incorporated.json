Most notable among those were Dran Enterprises, led by an impersonator of Omin Drans sister Auspicia, and the Six, a company that consisted of individuals who had been wronged as a result of Acquisitions Incorporateds activities.\nThe company was founded by the cleric Omin Dran as part of his efforts to find his sister Auspicia, who had gone missing after an incident in a ruin near Red Larch. Over time, the company expanded its activities and became a large for-profit adventuring outfit, including chapters throughout the Sword Coast and on the world of Ravnica."
