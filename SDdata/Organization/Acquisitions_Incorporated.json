        "mainbody": "'''Acquisitions Incorporated''' was an adventuring company from the [[Sword Coast]]. The organization consisted of several groups of adventurers for hire that acted more or less independently under the company's charter.",
        "Organization": "The company operated by providing a network of support infrastructure for adventuring groups, which were referred to as franchises. Each franchise was licensed to operate within a certain region, which could be expanded depending on the success of its endeavors. It was not uncommon for different franchises to compete over territory and exclusivity rights. In exchange, the organization's Head Office held the right to commission its franchises to engage in priority missions.\n\nSupport from Acq Inc's Head Office was provided in several instances, such as the establishment of a local headquarters, a staff of trained hirelings, and an assortment of [[magic item]]s provided to adventurers in accordance to their position within the franchise. All these features increased in influence and power as the franchise prospered.",
        "Base of Operations": "As a widespread company with many chapters, Acq Inc held bases in several locations. The company's original headquarters was located in the basement of the [[Silver Unicorn Inn]], located in the city of [[Fallcrest]].\n\nAt least one franchise of the company was established on the extraplanar world of [[Ravnica]].",
        "Relationships": "Acquisitions Incorporated had a number of rival adventuring companies that pursued the same mercenary business model. Most notable among those were [[Dran Enterprises]], led by an impersonator of [[Omin Dran]]'s sister [[Auspicia Dran|Auspicia]], and [[the Six]], a company that consisted of individuals who had been wronged as a result of Acquisitions Incorporated's activities.",
        "History": "The company was founded by the [[cleric]] Omin Dran as part of his efforts to find his sister Auspicia, who had gone missing after an incident in a ruin near Red Larch. Over time, the company expanded its activities and became a large for-profit adventuring outfit, including chapters throughout the Sword Coast and on the world of [[Ravnica]]."
