        "mainbody": "The Guild of Watermen was a group of Waterdhavian dockmen and sailors that kept Deepwater Harbor clean and free from debris and ferried goods from ships moored to the dock. Due to the amount of ships coming in and out of Waterdeeps port, their duties had them working round-the-clock. Fortunately, the importance of their labors was well-known.\nThey were the masters of the citys Dock Ward and knew all the harbors currents, its varying depths, and every drain pipe that emptied from the sewers.\nUsing a fleet of skiffs and small ferries, the Watermen removed any errant crates or other debris that could possibly clog the harbor, cleared away seaweed from ship hulls and disposed of bodies they came across.\nThey were allowed to keep any cargo they recovered, as long as it wasnt claimed by its previous owner within a period of seven months. If the owner identified lost goods, sufficient to the judgement of a local magister, but did not wish to immediately pick it up, the city stored the goods for some time and paid the Watermen a finders fee of 1 gp.\nThe guild charged 1 sp per man-hour to load or unload cargo from ships. This fee was increased to 2 sp if they had to handle hazardous or potentially deadly goods such as caged beasts, incendiary items or oil, or creatures that carried disease of the body or mind.\nGuild livery consisted of blue raincoats and white, formless hats.\n* Zzundar Thul \"Master of the Harbor\" during the late 14 century DR.\n* Jaster Thul The guilds spokesman in the same period."
