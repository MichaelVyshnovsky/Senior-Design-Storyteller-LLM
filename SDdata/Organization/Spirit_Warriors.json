        "mainbody": "The Spirit Warriors were a group of Lesser Immortals of the Celestial Bureaucracy, the dominant faith of Kara-Tur. They served Chan Cheng, the god of war.\nThe Spirit Warriors had the duties of creating courage and resolve in those who wavered, and leading armies of phantoms, the manifestation of which could swing a battle. Spirit Warriors also helped those whod fallen in battle for a good cause, escorted the spirits of heroes for judgement by the Lords of Karma, and guarded the gates of the Underworld against trespassers."
