The kavalrachni was the duergar cavalry that protected the underground city of Gracklstugh.
The kavalrachni rode atop great female steeders, giant-sized tarantulas native to the Underdark.
They carried with them heavy crossbows, which they wielded with masterful skill.
The majority of the kavalrachni hailed from Clan Xundom.
