        "mainbody": "The Toda clan were a family in Wa and the leaders of Aru Province during the 1600s on the Wa Calendar.\nThe Toda clan had only recently settled in Aru when the shogun granted the head of the clan, Sousuke, the daimyate in Wa Year 1628 (1210 DR), following the dismissal of Arata Matsutomo. As daimyo of Aru Province, Sousuke led well and Aru enjoyed a decade of peace.\nWhen Sousuke died in a hunting accident, his 17-year-old son Eiji became daimyo he was eager to do well but inexperienced. The following three years saw resurgent bandits devastate the pilgrim trains to Aru, though shogun Takahiro forgave Eiji because of his age and inexperience. Then, in 1640 (1222 DR), a foreign raiding party (possibly from Shou Lung) made it through the daimyos defenses to Arus outskirts and razed part of the Eta District. This failure was too great and Eiji was removed from office, with the daimyate passed back to the Matsutomos.\nAs Eiji died without an heir, the Toda line of Aru also died out.\n* Sousuke Toda\n* Eiji Toda"
