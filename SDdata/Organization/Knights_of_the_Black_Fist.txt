The '''Knights of the Black Fist''', that originated as the '''Brothers of the Black Fist''', was the military force that dutifully served the city-state of [[Phlan]] during the late 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. the Black Fist maintained tenuous connections with the faith of [[Bane]] that waned as the fighting force shifted its alignment to that of Phlan as a political power of the [[Moonsea]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|55}}

==Activities==
While the soldiers of the Black Fist served as the military force of Phlan, the [[Black Watch]] militia served as its primary law enforcement group within the city, having held those duties for many decades.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|54}} During times of internal strife however, the Knights of the Black Fist began to patrol the city streets themselves, enacting marshal law and forming an oppressive feeling of dread among the citizens of Phlan.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|60}}{{Cite adventurers league/Dues for the Dead|6}}

==Tactics==
In the years following their formation the knights were seen as stalwart defenders against the encroaching threat of the returned [[Netherese Empire]]. As strong leadership in Phlan waned over the years,{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|65}} the knights earned a reputation for corrupt practices and resorted to using brute force against the city's own citizens, turned to crime themselves, and some even eschewed their loyalty to the city itself.

==Base of Operations==
During their early years in the 14{{th}} century DR, the Brotherhood of the Black Fist operated from the [[Citadel of the Raven]] in the northern slopes of the [[Dragonspine Mountains]].

After the group's transformation into a the state-sponsored knighthood of Phlan,{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|9}}

maintained forces at [[Sokol Keep]] to watch over the sea fortress' lighthouse,{{Cite adventurers league/Secrets of Sokol Keep|13}}

==Relationships==
The [[Vilhon Mercenary Corps]] were formed by Lord [[Caleb Randol]] in direct response to the power the Black Fist held under the direction of the Lord Protector.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|52}}

==History==
The Brothers of the Black Fist was formed an elite fighting force following the death of Bane during the [[Time of Troubles]], and was still in its infancy as of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}.

After the unexpected death of Lord Protector [[Anivar Daoran|Anivar]] in a construction accident in Valjevo Castle,{{Cite web/Phlan during the Tyranny of Dragons}}

As the reborn [[Cult of the Dragon]] became entangled within Phlan during the 1480s DR,{{ToD-time}} and a series of thefts and kidnappings broke out throughout the city the Black Fist started to become overwhelmed with maintaining order in the city.{{Cite adventurers league/The Scroll Thief|5}}{{Cite adventurers league/Tales Trees Tell|7}} While some knights of the order left their comrades and turned to banditry,{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|11}} others were forced to stand against the citizens of Phlan as riots erupted throughout [[Podol Plaza]].{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|7}} It was even revealed that some in the city orchestrated an unsuccessful plot to assassinate Lord Regent Ector Brahms.{{Cite adventurers league/Outlaws of the Iron Route|5}}

The conflict in the came to a head when the [[green dragon]] [[Vorgansharax]] swooped down on Castle Valjevo castle and wrought destruction down on Phlan.{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|9}} Schisms within the Black Fist became evident when some of their order began slaying Phlan's citizens where they stood,{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|13}} their armor marked with splotches of green paint.{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|15}} Nearly half their number proved themselves to be traitors,{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|6}} forming their own group known as the [[Tears of Virulence]], loyal to the cult and its green wyrm patron.{{Cite adventurers league/Tyranny in Phlan|17}}

Lord Regent Brahms survived the initial assault thanks to the efforts of Knight [[Aleyd Burral]],{{Cite adventurers league/Pool of Radiance Resurgent|6}} but was later slain.{{Cite adventurers league/Reclamation of Phlan|6}}
