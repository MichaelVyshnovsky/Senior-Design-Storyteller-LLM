        "Headquarters": "The House Melarn compound was located in [[Lolth's Web]]—webs strung hundreds of feet off the cavern floor—in [[West Wall]] in [[Menzoberranzan]]. It was constructed after the unification of [[House Horlbar]] and [[House Kenafin]] with the expertise of drow refugees from [[Ched Nasad]]. The webs were lined with ''[[faerie fire]]''. The compound took the form of a shell, with a shrine to [[Lolth]] in the center, nobles' rooms around that, and other living quarters in the outer rings. The compound was guarded by [[spider]]s and [[drider]]s, as well as drow guards.",
        "Activities": "House Melarn was known as one of the Menzoberranyr houses most fanatical to [[Lolth]]. Matron [[Zhindia Melarn]] believed such fanaticism, including calling out other houses' apparent blasphemy, would bring Lolth's favor upon her. However, most houses resented House Melarn because of their behavior.\n\nThe house was strong militarily, but did not hire outsiders such as [[Bregan D'aerthe]] for fears concerning their loyalty.\n\nHouse Melarn, as well as [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]], was using the abandoned [[House Do'Urden]] complex as training grounds for its drow soldiers and [[drider]]s. The troops were kicked out by [[Bregan D'aerthe]] under the command of [[House Baenre]].",
        "History": "House Melarn was formed ''circa'' [[1383 DR]] by the merging of [[House Horlbar]] and [[House Kenafin]].\n\nAt the beginning of [[1484 DR]], House Melarn was the seventh house of Menzoberranzan. After [[House Xorlarrin]] left for [[Q'Xorlarrin]], they become the sixth house.",
        "Members": "Members of House Melarn were known as the \"Melarni.\" In addition to about 340 drow members, a number of [[drider]]s served the house. The Melarni were known for their religious zeal; even their male wizards were often obsessed with spiders, becoming [[arachnomancer]]s. Other elite fighters (male and female) trained to protect priestesses with their lives; these were called [[Dread Fang of Halisstra|Dread Fangs of Halisstra]].\n\nMost of the drow were Menzoberranyr; however, there were a number of survivors from the original House Melarn who joined the house.\n\nHouse Melarn had a number of [[drider]] and [[chitine]] slaves that labored in Lolth's Web.",
