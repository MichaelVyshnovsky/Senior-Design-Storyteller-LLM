The '''Renshas''' were a [[Calishite]] family that conquered [[Loudwater]] and much of the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], ruling it from the mid–12{{th}} to early 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].{{cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/What is the Green Regent}}

==History==
Ibun Rensha and several of his family members left [[Calimshan]] at the head of a mercenary army and journeyed into [[northwest Faerûn]]. They took over Loudwater and laid claim to most of Delimbiyr Vale in the [[1150 DR|Year of the Scourge, 1150 DR]], According to local stories, heroes of Loudwater of the time first sighted the approaching Rensha forces from [[Tragedy's Grotto]] in Loudwater.<ref>

This began a period known as the Rensha Rule. Seeing [[Mielikki]]'s [[Green Regent]]s and their [[Scions of the Green Regent|Scions]] as threats to their reign, the Renshas banned the ritual to select Green Regents and Scions every [[Shieldmeet]] and hunted down any that they found, causing them to vanish for more than a century.

Misbah Rensha made a treaty with [[Thay]]. This included the establishment of the [[Ivy Enclave]] in Loudwater and his marriage to a Thayan woman,<ref> the [[Red Wizard]] [[Thola]], who also served as his court sorceress. He later had her [[poison]]ed to end her plotting.

Though the Renshas made the town more prosperous and expanded its connections with the outside world, they exploited the Vale's natural resources and despoiled much of the pristine beauty of the area. Under them, loggers cleared the forests away from the river and farmers claimed the land for agriculture, while miners strip-mined the mountains, all at a shocking pace, and the wealth flowed down the river and out of the vale.

Over time, the amoral Renshas descended into decadence and the pursuit of dark [[magic]].

The last Rensha lord, [[Pasuuk Rensha]] ordered a band of talented mercenary hunters to obtain for him a [[unicorn]]'s horn. His reasons for this were not known, but some worried it was for a ritual of dark magic that would link [[High Lord's Hall]] with the [[Nine Hells]], and he was later confirmed to consort with [[devil]]s.

Finally, after two years of fierce fighting, the war culminated in the [[Battle of Tanglefork]] in the [[1317 DR|Year of the Wandering Wyrm, 1317 DR]], when Pasuuk and the Renshas' forces confronted Nanathlor and his ragtag band. Nanathlor called on Mielikki for aid, and she ''[[awaken]]ed'' the trees around the battlefield and set them to attack Pasuuk's forces. In response, Pasuuk summoned a coven of [[devil]]s to assault the trees. Ultimately, Mielikki's servants were victorious and the devils and Pasuuk were all killed in the fighting.

Although the Renshas were ousted from Loudwater, the family survived in Calimshan and continued to deal with devils. In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Sanaja Rensha and Paronthen Rensha aided a failed [[Zhentarim]] plot to conquer the city.

===Legacy===
Being rather secretive, the Rensha lords left few records of their works.

The [[High Lord's Hall]] in Loudwater was built by the Rensha family during their rule. This walled manor displayed an odd mixture of southern Calishite and elven styles.

==Symbol==
The family crest was a single red moon against a field of gold.

==Legends==
Rumors told in Loudwater, such as by warehouse owner [[Agrath Dundai]] to [[Volothamp Geddarm]] sometime before [[1366 DR]], claimed there was a crypt beneath High Lord's Hall haunted by [[undead]], namely the remnants of former Rensha High Lords of Loudwater, and that some of them had experimented with dark [[magic]]. This was all completely correct.
