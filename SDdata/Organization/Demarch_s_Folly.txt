'''Demarch's Folly''' was a [[spellcasting organization]] based in the [[Halls of Demarch]] in the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]] in [[north Faerûn]]. Its members were dedicated to learning [[shadow magic]] and other shadow-based [[magic]]s, such as the [[Shadow Weave]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Shadowcasters|}}

==History==
Originally, [[Demarch's Alliance]] was a group of [[beguiler]]s devoted to [[Leira]] and [[Mask]]. But shortly after the [[Time of Troubles]] of [[1358 DR|the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], Mask betrayed Leira, and Demarch's Alliance was broken. The two factions fought the vicious [[Battle of Demarch's Fall]] in the Halls of Demarch, leaving many dead and their former base infested with [[undead]], shrouded in mist, and the site of a rift to the [[Plane of Shadow]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Beguilers and Dragon Shamans|}}

The survivors fled across [[Faerûn]], living in fear of revenge attacks and church agents seeking to learn or maintain their secrets, most never coming back. A few friendly ex-members, however, returned to the Halls of Demarch, believing the safest place to hide was the last place they were expected. They took the name Demarch's Folly.

They also sought a more solid and direct form of magical power than [[illusion]]s for their protection. Ironically, they found it in their very own halls. The rift to the Plane of Shadow had deposited a number of [[magic item]]s and the ''[[tome of Suelivain]]''. From the tome, they learned the fundamentals of [[shadow magic]]. Later, they began seeking out beings mentioned in the tome and finding other works about shadow magic, and dedicating themselves and Demarch's Folly to its mastery.

They tracked down [[Suelivain]], a [[shade]] of the [[City of Shade]] and a [[shadowcaster]], and returned his tome and other possessions in exchange for training in the ways of shadow magic. Suelivain accepted and joined Demarch's Folly in the role of mentor and leader. He educated them in the differences between shadow magic and [[Shadow Weave]] magic.

Growing curious in the Shadow Weave as well, Demarch's Folly sought out a user of both, finding [[Zezania Tarth-Kelet]], a priestess of [[Shar]]. Zezania also joined to offer guidance.

The members of Demarch's Folly continued their search for shadow magic into [[1374 DR]].

==Organization==
Demarch's Folly was an arcane guild. It consisted of and accepted new members who had some shadow-based powers, such as [[shadowcaster]]s, users of [[Shadow Weave]] magic, [[shadowcrafter]]s, and [[shadowdancer]]s, or were of races innately connected to shadow, like [[shade]]s, [[illumian]]s, and [[half-dragon|half]]–[[shadow dragon]]s. Members were also required to have a good deal of knowledge about the [[arcane]] arts, [[religion]], the [[planes]], and/or [[history]].

Members were required to pay dues to Demarch's Folly, equal to a 10% tithe of their earnings.

The guild was led by [[Suelivain]], who also served as a mentor. [[Zezania Tarth-Kelet]] also provided guidance.

==Activities==
The members of Demarch's Folly journeyed the world in search of information about shadow magic and all forms of shadow powers. They sought fragments of knowledge, people who knew about these things, and relics or [[magic item]]s. They offered their services in exchange for information and training, and usually dealt fairly with those who had what they needed. Although a number of its members were [[evil]], they only occasionally resorted to theft or intimidation.

==Base==
The members of Demarch's Folly were based in the [[Halls of Demarch]], a hidden guildhall beneath the city of Tantras.
