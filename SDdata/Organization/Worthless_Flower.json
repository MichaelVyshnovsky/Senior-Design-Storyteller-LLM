        "mainbody": "he Worthless Flower gang was a yakuza group in Nakamaru in Wa around 1357 DR.\nThe Worthless Flowers main business was gambling. They tried to control all gambling operations in the city and surrounding area, but their games were not overtly dishonest. Although the odds were in the yakuzas favor, others won enough that they would return. The Worthless Flower ran many gambling houses in the city separated by the status of its patrons, with some only for samurai, some for merchants, and so on.\nThe Worthless Flower was organized like a family with the boss as the father of his underlings. Among its important rules were secrecy, loyalty to the oyabun, and the banning of theft and other petty crimes. The Worthless Flower were officially recognized by citys authorities."
