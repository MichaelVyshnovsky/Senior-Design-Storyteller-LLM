The '''School of the Penitents''' was an order devoted to the god [[Ilmater]], the One Who Endures, and was dedicated to spreading his faith in the [[Underdark]]. It was active by the 1370s [[DR]].

It consisted of nine separate groups, each with only four or five members. They kept a number of small enclaves in unexplored locations throughout the [[Upperdark]] level of the Underdark. From these places, they gave aid to those who came to them and spread their dogma of enduring suffering to the denizens of the subterranean world.{{Cite web enhancement/Underdark Dungeons|1}}
