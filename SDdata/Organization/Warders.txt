The '''warders''' were a loose military order based in or around the [[halfling]] cities of [[Luiren]].

==Organization==
A particularly large troop of warders found in [[Beluir]] was composed of 400 halflings who were all elite specialists with the [[sling]].

==Tactics==
While using stealth to their advantage, the warders preferred to attack any threat to Beluir with a hail of stones from multiple directions. The enemy was often so confused that they did not realize where they were being attacked from.
