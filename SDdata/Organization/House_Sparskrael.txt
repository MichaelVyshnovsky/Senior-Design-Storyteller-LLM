'''House Sparskrael''' was a [[Lolthite]] [[drow]] house of the city of [[Sschindylryn]] in the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{DDO-time}}
{{Quote
|If the "help" from Sparskrael fail to live up to their bargain, kill them. Our alliance has no use for those who cannot follow through. Yet, House Sparskrael will not tolerate any of their number being added to [[Avithoul]]'s slave-pits, so make sure they are stripped of their markings and made mute if necessary.
|High Priestess [[Hekta Szind]]'s missive
}}
==History==
During the [[Darkening]] in the mid-1480s DR, Sparskrael offered assistance to the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] as a lesser member of the drow alliance. High Priestess [[Hekta Szind]] had a very low opinion of their contribution, and considered secretly killing and [[Slavery|enslaving]] them instead.

==Members==
During the invasion of Eveningstar in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the house was rarely seen:

* [[Jorenthar Sparskrael]], a wandering [[drider]].
