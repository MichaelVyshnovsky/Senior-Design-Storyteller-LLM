        "mainbody": "The Dreadspells were a short-lived group of Sharran priests empowered by the capture of an avatar of Mystra in the midâ€“8 century DR.\nThe charter of the Dreadspells was to fetch enchanted objects and destroy the Chosen of Mystra.\nThe Dreadspells had the ability to employ arcane spells thanks to a rite, but conspicuously did not adapt their tactics accordingly.\nThey operated, however briefly, out of the House of Holy Night.\nTheir leader, Elryn, served under the command of the Dark Lady Avroana.\nIn the , the Sharrans at the House of Holy Night developed a rite through which they could use a captive aspect of Mystra, the sorceress-queen Dasumia, to cast the spells of wizards. The newly formed group of priests that would employ such arcane magic was dubbed the Dreadspells, and they were soon sent after Elminster Aumar, a Chosen of Mystra, who had been spotted near Westgate.\nThe Dreadspells tracked Elminster to a ruin, fighting the elven mage Ilbryn Starym along the way with only one casualty. They tried to use it to slay Elminster, but failed due to the intervention of the god Azuth and the undead Netherese sorceress Saeraede Lyonora. The group was completely slain soon after by the successive efforts of Klalaera, an enforcer of Shar come to herd them back into the fray after they fled Azuth, then the mages Umbregard and Starsunder, who attacked them while they were being pushed back towards Azuth, and finally the archmage Tenthar Taerhamoos, who finished them off.\n* Elryn\n* Daluth\n* Vaelam\n* Femter Deldrannus\n* Hrelgrath\n* Iyrindyl"
