The Circle of the Stag was a druid order devoted to Mielikki and based in the High Forest in the 14 century DR.
Not a close or rigid organization, the Circle of the Stag only occasionally met in person. They included both masters and novices
A peaceful and reclusive order, their most notable duty was to hold the ceremony for selection of the Green Regent, one of the Chosen of Mielikki. The Circle of the Stag conducted this in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale every Shieldmeet. They also brewed the Greendraught, which was to be drunk from the Ladys Chalice. Kept safe and secret by the Circle, these were believed to be crucial to the ceremony without them, there could never be another Green Regent.
There were based at a stone circle within the High Forest.
The druids wore brown robes with green stitching depicting rampant stags, together with a wooden holy symbol of Mielikki.
