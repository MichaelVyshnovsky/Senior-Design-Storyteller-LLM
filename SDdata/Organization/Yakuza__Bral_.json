        "mainbody": "he Yakuza were a thieves guild operating in the city of Bral on the Rock of Bral in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. They were led by Underbaron Ozamata Ku Murawa.\nThey were highly organized and numbered around 40 members, but Ozamata could recruit up to 50 to 60 thugs and fighters if needed. Members were all Shou humans native to Bral. They were marked by their tattoos.\nThey engaged in extortion, racketeering, and gambling, and avoided any thing as basic as burglary or fighting for territory. Their goal was simply to maintain the status quo that they profited off of. They carefully watched all visitors to Shou-town.\nMembers were thieves and fighters skilled in gaming, gathering information, and intimidation, and were knowledgeable in Bralian history.\nThe Yakuza ruled Shou-town and controlled the Docks and much of the Low City.\nTheir headquarters lay concealed within Shou-town. Originally a warehouse, and one of the oldest in Bral, it was converted to a boarding house, then abandoned, and finally reclaimed and renovated by the Yakuza. It still seemed to be a small and unremarkable warehouse, and so ramshackle it had a decided lean. Passers-by noticed nothing unusual, but it was well-secured with locked doors and many alert guards inside. It lay just off Dragon Street in Shou-town.\nThey were armed with daggers, clubs, and crossbows, and wore leather armor or studded leather.\nWithin Shou-town, the leaders of the Yakuza were well-known and readily obeyed by the people. No Shou within their domain would freely betray them.\nWithin the citys politics, the Yakuza were tolerant of the Temple of Ptah and giff were neutral toward the Seekers, mages, and the Arcane did not much like the Pragmatic Order of Thought, the Tenth Pit, the Jugglers Men, and dwarves and were enemies of the Halfling Thieves Guild, the Red Masks, the Watchers, and elves.\nThe Yakuza were established by Ozamata when he first settled in Bral. They quickly took hold in Shou-town and fought vicious battles to expand their territory.\nBy the 1360s DR, they were still swelling in power and were plotting to force out the Halfling Thieves Guild."
