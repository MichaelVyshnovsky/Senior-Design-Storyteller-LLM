The '''Dark Diviners''' were a cadre of wizard's based in [[Myth Drannor]]'s [[Windsong Tower]]. They discovered the tome the ''[[Book of the Black]]''. Written (in part) by the [[Netherese]] seer [[Augathra the Mad]], the book revealed many of the goddess [[Shar]]'s dark secrets. The Dark Diviners wrote of their findings and insights in ''[[The Leaves of One Night]]''. Shar, displeased with their work, and acrimonious of their text, cursed both books and arranged for them to be stolen from Windsong Tower, after which they were not to be seen again for centuries.<ref name=tGHotR-p97> After the theft, the Dark Diviners left Windsong Tower to try to recreate their stolen work (''The Leaves of One Night'' was unique) and deduce what went wrong.
