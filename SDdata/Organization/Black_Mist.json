        "mainbody": "The '''Black Mist''' gang was a [[yakuza]] group in [[Nakamaru]] in [[Wa]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Seemingly powerful across Wa, the Black Mist were recently established in [[Nakamaru]] by [[1357 DR]]. The Black Mist tried to control all illegal business in the city, entering into feuds with the both [[Big Head]] and [[Worthless Flower]] gangs, who were cautious in trying to destroy the Black Mist.",
        "Organization": "The Black Mist followed the normally family-like hierarchy but were also divided into different branches, based on the type of illegal activity: one for gambling, one for protection, and, unique to the Black Mist, the [[Wa-an dictionary#G|''gurentai'']], thugs that often attacked the Big Head bases.",
        "Relations": "The Black Mist did not have the city authorities' recognition so they were always on their guard against the police and local [[samurai]]. Instead, they forged an alliance with traders of the foreign districts, especially merchants from [[Shou Lung]]."
