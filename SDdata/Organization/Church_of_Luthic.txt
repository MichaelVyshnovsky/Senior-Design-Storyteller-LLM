The church of Luthic () was the primary religious organization dedicated to the worship and service of the orc goddess Luthic, The Cave Mother.There is no known proper name for the overall body of clergy dedicated to Luthic, nor is there a unified formal organization. Instead, the term "church of Luthic" is adopted for discussion and wiki purposes.
Integral to the Cave Mothers teachings was of the importance of earth, with which she had a strong affinity. Life sprang forth from the ground and the caverns sheltered that life, for caves were the bastion of orc strength and a source of their valor, ensuring the race would survive as long as they stayed close to the earth (and Luthic with it). Being the orc goddess of fertility, (moreso for females, with Gruumsh being prayed to for male virility)
Perhaps most crucially, the followers of the Blood Moon Witch were to honor her wisdom, for Luthics strength was at the core of an orc horde and an orcs bravery. Enduring the hardships of life, understanding ones position in the tribe, and doing ones part to strengthen and guarantee the tribes survival against the predations of its rivals was paramount.
Many aspects of orc life fell under Luthics purview, and as such the duties of her priestesses and priests were varied. as well as fortifying and maintaining their strongholds and watching over the food supply.
Luthics followers were given raid captives and used them as slave labor to dig more space, as well as perform other menial tasks. Even so, Luthics followers emulated her by personally digging deep into the caverns of their dens to create more living space for the desired, ever-expanding population while the rest of the tribe raided.  Luthics clergy formed the stable base of many tribes, ensuring a steady, healthy crop of future warriors were born each year.
As followers of a god of healing and primitive medicine, most Luthicans were skilled in such ways, and as well as teaching simple herbalism to others, attended to the wounded, the young, and those about to give birth. The Cave Mothers symbol and favored beast was the cave bear, and her followers honored this aspect by raising such creatures alongside orc whelps, using their pets to guard the squabbling spawn as well as resting slaves.
Few orcs directly prayed to Luthic,  Males typically worshiped Luthic for her healing abilities and personal ferocity, and she was generally worshiped by orcs and half-orcs alike who desired safety, but her following was outwardly weak compared to most and subservient to that of Gruumsh.
Orcs believed that orogs, orcs with exceptional strength and intellect, had been blessed by Luthic, and were a gift to the tribe. Some orc chiefs feared them, and felt tempted to kill the young ones to preserve their positions even though doing so would likely anger Luthic, so they were raised out of sight. However, what most chiefs didnt understand was that orogs served more as a balancing force, for they were indoctrinated by Luthics priestesses to protect other Luthicans and non-raiders in a tribe and prevent the tribe from splintering when the old chief died and/or many warriors were killed.  Orcs guarding Luthican clerics fought with feral madness that made them dangerous, but also more vulnerable to attack. Still, orogs typically worshiped Gruumsh and Luthic foremost because of their might, and a rogue olog might seek to create a religious schism in the tribe.
Aside from orcs, Luthic was also worshiped by some earth genasi, whether or not they were devoted enough to be actual clerics.

Luthics particularly devoted grew out and lacquered their nails in imitation of their goddess, which the Blood Moon Witch sometimes rewarded by making their claws as tough as iron, talons that they would learn to use as weapons just as Luthic did. The most powerful of the Cave Mothers disciples were the Claws of Luthic, who tended to the orc brood, raising them to be as strong and cruel as their parents, from deep within the caves. Given magic to heal, protect, and curse, Luthics claws would keep the tribe together by any means necessary, whether by tradition and superstition, omen and ceremony, or fear and force. To be beaten and bloodied would only make them fight all the harder.
Many orc tribes forbade females from touching weapons, though if allowed to carry arms, Luthican worshipers used edged weapons aside from arrows. To defend themselves against the raiders of other tribes, Luthicans learned unarmed combat, utilizing the martial prowess of a monk to defeat their foes. A few of them became runecasters, using magic learnt from the giants that sometimes lived alongside orc tribes.
The clerics and adepts of Luthic prayed for their spells nightly, when the moon was highest in the sky.
Speaking of The Blood Moon Witch was normally taboo for most, given her penchant for spreading sickness when her name was used inappropriately, but the savage priests of Gruumsh came out of their caves under blood moons to commit vile atrocities in Luthics name.
Luthican orcs rubbed dirt on themselves in the hopes of having many children, and even if not actually required, her clerics used earth when casting curative spells as a symbolic gesture.
Luthican clerics conducted her services underground, with cave halls serving as their places of worship.
Followers of Luthic wore brown and black leather armor and fur caps.
Clerics of Luthic could a limited version of lay on hands like paladins, although only after a battle. They could cast a darkness spell that lasted twice as long as the regular version, and a slow regenerate that only worked underground. 
Luthic was greatly feared by the followers of Gruumsh, for his worshipers believed her to be his servant because she embodied his desire to create confusion and mayhem. It was Luthics binding influence that preventing the violent savagery and ambitious warring of the orcs from destroying them, the Cave Mother acting as the glue that held orc culture together.
It was Luthics worshipers that raised young orcs to be warriors, and her priestesses brought orcs nearing their end to both him and Shargaas to be carried into death and the great unknown.
