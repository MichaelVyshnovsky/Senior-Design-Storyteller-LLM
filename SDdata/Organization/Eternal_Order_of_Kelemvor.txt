The Eternal Order of Kelemvor were followers of Kelemvor who maintained the Neverdeath Graveyard in Neverwinter.
Their duty was to maintain the sanctity of Neverdeath, a graveyard that was considered sacred to Kelemvor. In keeping with the tenants of the church of Kelemvor, they taught that death was natural and not to be feared but that undead were unnatural and had to be destroyed. They saw themselves as servants of both the dead and the bereaved they conducted funerals, ensured that the dead could rest in peace, provided counseling to those who lost loved ones, and destroyed undead.
The Order was aligned with Neverwinter, including the New Neverwinter movement and the Neverwinter Guard.
When the undead began to rise in the late 15 century DR, the Eternal Order of Kelemvors duty shifted to fighting the undead and the Thayan necromancers raising them. By , they had lost control of the graveyard and had retreated to a small camp known as Doomguides Watch.
