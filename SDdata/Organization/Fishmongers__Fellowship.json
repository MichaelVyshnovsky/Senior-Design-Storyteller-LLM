        "mainbody": "The '''Fishmongers' Fellowship''' was an informal and friendly collective of fishmongers in [[Waterdeep]] who assisted the local fishermen by buying their catches and re-selling them in stalls throughout the city.",
        "Activities": "Many Waterdhavian fisherman never docked anywhere in [[Deepwater Harbor]], save for the wharf of [[Seaswealth Hall]] where they were exempt from docking fees. They sold their eels, crabs, and fish to the guildmaster, a retired fisherman known as [[Avbrauve Haltorel|Aybrauve \"Farfisher\"]], who then sorted, iced, and sent them out in carts to guild members located throughout the city. The distribution of the iced fish was overseen by Waterdeep's [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] in order to prevent theft.\n\nAny spoiled goods could be sold back to the guildmaster for 1 [[cp]] per bucket. The rotten seafood was then sold to the [[Council of Farmer-Grocers]] who used it to make fertilizer.",
        "Uniform": "Guild livery consisted of silver caps adorned with blue eyes on either side or silver sashes that were decorated with a single blue eye.",
        "Membership": "Actual fishermen were not granted membership into the Fishmongers' Fellowship. Members were admitted upon paying a one-time fee of 5 [[gp]] and maintained their admittance with an annual payment of 2 gp."
