Their headquarters were located in Telflamm,  where they rule the city in all but name. While they were dedicated to the deity Mask for many years, sometime after the Spellplague they shifted their devotion to the goddess Shar.\nThe guild maintained a strong alliance with the House of the Masters Shadow, the largest temple of Mask, throughout the 14 century.\nThe guild has operated within Telflamm since the year 927 DR. While their power and influence have grown and diminished throughout the years, they have greatly affected the course of the citys development. For example, the guilds \"snub\" of the Hierarch prevented Telflamm from joining the larger nation of Thesk.\nIn 1339 DR, the cunning thief, and former priest of Mask, Volludan ascended as guildmaster renamed the organization in honor of their deity. Over the next 15 years the newly-dubbed Shadowmasters manipulated events within Telflamm that led to dominant control over the citys crime. Through Volludans schemes and machinations they expanded their economic holdings and became so powerful as to rival the citys nobility and religious institutions.\n*Purban Faltelfowe Leader of the Shadowmasters operating in Escalant"
