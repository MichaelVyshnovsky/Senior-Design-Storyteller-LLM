The Moon-spinners were a holy slayer organization in Zakhara who followed the teachings of Selan, the Zakharan goddess of beauty.
The symbol of the Moon-spinners was a long white scarf, which they used to whip or strangle their victims.
Holy slayers from the Moon-spinners were obsessed with making Selan the most-worshiped deity on the Isle of the Elephant.
They were in direct opposition with followers of the Lost One.
The Isle of the Elephant was the domain of the Moon-spinners.
