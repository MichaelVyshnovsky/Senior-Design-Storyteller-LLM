The Eyeless Mask was a sinister organization dedicated to enslaving all wizards, clerics, and nobility.
The majority of power within in the Eyeless Mask came from 14 extremely secretive Red Wizards of Thay. The remaining members were thieves, priests of unknown faiths, and warriors.
Members of this group kidnapped spellcasters, priests, and nobility. They especially enjoyed preying on visitors to the city. The Red Wizards within the Eyeless Mask were after as much magic as they could get their hands on, believing that in doing so they would weaken the area for a future invasion from Thay.
The Eyeless Mask held the most influence within the cities of Saerloon and Urmlaspyr in Sembia.
