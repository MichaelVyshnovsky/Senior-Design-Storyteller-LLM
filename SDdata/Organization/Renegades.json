        "mainbody": "The Renegades were a mercenary company based in Chessenta.\nThe company included 70 cavalry, 20 infantry, and 90 archers. There were also six scouts and ten mages.\nIn battle, the Renegades did anything to win. Normally mages and archers first softened the enemy, after which the infantry attacked and the cavalry made the final assault.\nThey accepted any kind of job. They were known to be ruthless and twisted the spirit of agreements with employers. They were on good terms with several pirate bands. They normally charged 200 gold pieces per week for their services.\nBy the early 1218 DR, Renegades numbers were in around 4,000 soldiers. The company was hired by Ugo Svar√©zi of the Blade Kingdoms. The usurper amassed an army of mercenaries virtually overnight and waged war on the city-states of the Blade Kingdoms.\nAround 1358 DR, the Renegades were a military unit from the city of Akanax, the town of soldiers. Desiring gold and glory, they deserted, led by the famous fighter Helyos."
