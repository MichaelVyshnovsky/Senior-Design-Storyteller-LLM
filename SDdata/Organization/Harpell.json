        "mainbody": "The '''Harpell''' ({{Pronounce|HAR|pell|refs=}}) family was an eccentric clan of [[wizard]]s who, for the most part, lived in the [[Ivy Mansion]] in [[Longsaddle]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] of [[northwest Faerûn]].",
        "Organization": "They were a kind-hearted clan, but their magic was capricious, sometimes backfiring in peculiar ways. As members of the [[Lords' Alliance]],",
        "Scholarship": "After the Harpells interviewed [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] about the [[drow]] in [[1356 DR]], they published a treatise on the drow that was distributed to notable leaders and leading wizards. This was known as the ''[[Harpell treatise]]'' or the ''[[Harkle treatise]]''. The treatise mentioned that drow liked to eat animals that were still alive because it gave the meat a better flavor.",
        "The Ivy Mansion": "The Ivy Mansion consisted of three main buildings: two that looked like simple farmhouses and a unique, heavily spired central house. The mansion was surrounded by a fence of magic that, while normally invisible, had been painted to look like a fence. The mansion grounds also featured an \"Underbridge/Overbridge\" that arched over an uphill-flowing stream—to get to the mansion, you walked upside-down on the underside of the bridge, and to leave the mansion grounds you walked on the top side. There was also a stable full of strange animal creations and miniaturized mounts.\n\nInside the Ivy Mansion was the [[Fuzzy Quarterstaff]], a tavern and inn run by the Harpells. The main room of the tavern consisted of a circular room and a wizard conducting an invisible orchestra. Guests could order drinks from a magical green gem placed on every table; the drinks were then brought to them on magical floating blue disks.",
        "History": "Around [[1245 DR]], the Harpells' conflict with the [[Talonmist]] family of [[Westbridge]] began when [[Ordrar Talonmist]] was killed in a spell duel by [[Darnthal Harpell]].\n\nFor generations, the Harpells gave Longsaddle more prestige in [[the North]] than its size and purpose would warrant. This tradition began with mighty [[Authrar Harpell]], who was famous in the North for single-handedly destroying an onrushing [[orc]] horde with spells.\n\n[[Catti-brie]], under the name of \"Delly Curtie,\" dwelt and studied magic with the Harpells in Longsaddle from [[1479]] to [[1482 DR]]. She was considered nearly family, to the point some suggested she be \"ordained a Harpell.\"",
