The '''Sunmasters''' were an elite contingent within the [[Thayan]] military active during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The group was mostly made up of [[Banite]] [[cleric]]s and [[warlock]]s specializing in radiant [[magic]]s.

==Activities==
The Sunmasters were sworn to serve Thay, and were led by Corporal [[Isma Lecere]]. They were trained as an elite strike force specializing in dealing with Thay's [[Shadovar]] enemies during the [[Shadovarâ€“Thay War]]. As such, they rarely became involved in anything but the most important or the most desperate battles.

==Base of Operations==
The Sunmasters were assigned to [[Surcross]], a well-defended town on Thay's western border. They had their own special chambers within the town's fortified [[Garrison (Surcross)|garrison]], which were unusually opulent and cushy. They had comfortable beds, thick carpets, luxurious clothes, and fine food and wine,

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, Surcross came under attack by the flying Shadovar citadel of [[Kolthunral]], resulting in a long and grueling battle. Even so, the Sunmasters remained largely aloof, only engaging in combat when circumstances called for their elite talents.
