In 1482 DR, a young adolescent of the Ravenshade family, along with other noble youths, severed the hand of the Beloved Ranger. The young Ravenshade member dropped a brooch from their cloak, pointing them to the crime. They hid away in Horgold Hadrus cellar, as Hadru owed one of the patriar families a favor.
