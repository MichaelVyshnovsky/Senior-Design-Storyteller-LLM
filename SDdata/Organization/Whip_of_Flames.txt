'''The Whip of Flames''' was an adventuring company from the city of [[Kelazzan]] in [[Ulgarth]], active in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
Like most powerful individuals in the region, members of The Whip of Flames were all-female or mostly female. The adventuring companies in the region were filled with dramatic schemes, plots, and feuds amongst the groups, and The Whip of Flames was no exception, feuding with the [[Ladies of Renown]] of [[Myrmyr]].

==History==
In the mid–14{{th}} century DR, The Whip of Flames sent their agents to the lands north and west from the [[Shining South]] in search of new magics to give them the upper hand against other adventuring bands. The Whips traveled to [[Thay]], [[Rashemen]], [[Waterdeep]], the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]], and [[Zhentil Keep]], among other locations.
