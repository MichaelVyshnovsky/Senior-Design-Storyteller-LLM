        "mainbody": "The '''Eyes of the Evening''' was a secretive sisterhood of [[werecat]]s who served both [[Selûne]], [[goddess]] of the [[Selûne (moon)|moon]], and [[Sharess]], goddess of hedonism.",
        "Activities": "The Eyes of the Evening were actively opposed to worshipers of [[Shar]] and [[Loviatar]], and were known to hunt them during full moons. In their [[humanoid]] forms, members would disguise themselves as [[prostitute|sex workers]] to gather intelligence or to go out on patrol.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, members of the Eyes of the Evening active in [[Waterdeep]] discovered a cult of [[Talona]]-worshiping [[wererat]]s conspiring to spread a [[disease|plague]] throughout the [[Waterdeep/Dock Ward|Dock Ward]]. Before the werecats could coordinate an attack on the cult, their findings were discovered by a [[priest]] at the [[House of the Moon]] who had secretly become a wererat. This priest revealed the identities and locations of the Eyes of Evening to the Talona worshipers, who hunted and killed the werecats one-by-one. The wererats then purportedly made plans to attack the House of the Moon itself.\n\nIn the years following this incident, the Eyes of the Evening became better known for their moonlit hunts of the followers of certain [[evil]] gods."
