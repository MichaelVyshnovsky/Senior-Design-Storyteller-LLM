In their humanoid forms, members would disguise themselves as sex workers to gather intelligence or to go out on patrol.\nIn the , members of the Eyes of the Evening active in Waterdeep discovered a cult of Talona-worshiping wererats conspiring to spread a plague throughout the Dock Ward. Before the werecats could coordinate an attack on the cult, their findings were discovered by a priest at the House of the Moon who had secretly become a wererat. This priest revealed the identities and locations of the Eyes of Evening to the Talona worshipers, who hunted and killed the werecats one-by-one. The wererats then purportedly made plans to attack the House of the Moon itself.\nIn the years following this incident, the Eyes of the Evening became better known for their moonlit hunts of the followers of certain evil gods."
