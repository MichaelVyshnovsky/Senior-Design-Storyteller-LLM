The Company managed to recover the scepter from a long-forgotten dwarven tomb in the Starspire Mountains. They were ordered to maintain a low profile on their return journey, and on Uktar 10, they stopped in to the Blue Badger Inn in the village of Toralth for drink.\nLater that night, three dwarves, Bapar Ghalmrin, Odak Truesteel, and Soram Battlebellow, entered the tavern seeking the Sondarr Scepter. However, the dwarves accidentally engaged in a brawl with the Shields of the Highland adventuring company. Bramas and his companions used this as an opportunity to escape with the scepter, but the dwarves eventually caught up with them and recovered it."
