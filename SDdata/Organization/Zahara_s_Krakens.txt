Zaharas Krakens were a mercenary company based in the Sword Coast around 1358 DR. They had a lucrative business of protecting shipping. Zahara the Shark was the human female leader of the crew.
Whilst attacking a port, they tried to kept destruction to a minimum. The Krakens only did this if it served a noble cause, like deposing an evil lord.
The Krakens had five small ships. Each ship had onboard 15 crew members, 30 marines, five spellcasters. One of the ships had, unknown to general public, a spelljamming helm that permitted them to fly in desperate occasion.
The Krakens took 500 gold piece for a week or any portion thereof, half in advance. They asked terrestrial support to attack a port.
