        "mainbody": "The '''Whiskered Gang''' was a group of [[wererat]] bandits active around the [[Triboar Trail (region)|Triboar Trail]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Organization": "The group was led by [[Zeleen Varnaster]], and consisted only of wererats and their pet [[giant rat]]s.",
        "Tactics": "The gang relied on guile and backstabbing as much as brute force. They were clearly unafraid to kill innocents, but when faced with more dangerous enemies, they would pretend to cooperate and come to an agreement.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, the gang was using the [[Shrine of Savras (Conyberry)|Shrine of Savras]] just south of [[Conyberry]] as their base of operations. However, they were driven out by [[orc]]s, who in turn had been driven out of their home at [[Icespire Hold]] by the [[white dragon]] [[Cryovain]].\n\nNow without a home, the gang descended upon the [[Mountain's Toe]] [[gold]] mine. Using stealth and guile to attack the miners while their backs were turned, the wererats slaughtered eleven of the sixteen [[human]] and [[dwarf]] occupants of the mine, and drove the survivors to the eastern exit. They left the survivors alone at this point, confident that they would either flee or die of starvation if they attempted to stay in the eastern tunnels. The gang then proceeded to ransack the mine, and claimed it as their new base.",
        "Members": "During their takeover of the Mountain's Toe mine in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the gang consisted of three female wererats (including Zeleen), a handful of male wererats, and four giant rats."
