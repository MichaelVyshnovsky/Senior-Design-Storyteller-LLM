        "mainbody": "The Whiskered Gang was a group of wererat bandits active around the Triboar Trail in the late 15 century DR.\nThe group was led by Zeleen Varnaster, and consisted only of wererats and their pet giant rats.\nThe gang relied on guile and backstabbing as much as brute force. They were clearly unafraid to kill innocents, but when faced with more dangerous enemies, they would pretend to cooperate and come to an agreement.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the gang was using the Shrine of Savras just south of Conyberry as their base of operations. However, they were driven out by orcs, who in turn had been driven out of their home at Icespire Hold by the white dragon Cryovain.\nNow without a home, the gang descended upon the Mountains Toe gold mine. Using stealth and guile to attack the miners while their backs were turned, the wererats slaughtered eleven of the sixteen human and dwarf occupants of the mine, and drove the survivors to the eastern exit. They left the survivors alone at this point, confident that they would either flee or die of starvation if they attempted to stay in the eastern tunnels. The gang then proceeded to ransack the mine, and claimed it as their new base.\nDuring their takeover of the Mountains Toe mine in the late 15 century DR, the gang consisted of three female wererats (including Zeleen), a handful of male wererats, and four giant rats."
