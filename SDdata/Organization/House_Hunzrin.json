        "mainbody": "House Hunzrin was a drow house of Menzoberranzan that controlled much of the agriculture within the city. For that reason, the pitchfork was the weapon of choice for the family.\nHouse Hunzrin was stuck in the district of Eastmyr, despite its arrogance and the fact that it controlled most of Menzoberranzans agriculture.\nHouse Hunzrin used quaggoths as shock troops and guards. It also employed a naga named Ssassar.\nthumb|Members of House Hunzrin from left to right 360x360px\nHouse Hunzrin was in charge of the lands around Lake Donigarten and the rothé herds, which produced cheese and meat, on the Isle of Rothe within the lake. They employed orc and goblin slaves to care for the herds. \nIn 1361 DR, after many drow and slaves were killed in the attack upon Mithral Hall, the rothé herds were in a poor state. Shakti Hunzrin, on leave from Arach-Tinilith to look after the herds, reported the following dismal numbers\n*40 goblins half of them herders, half of them breeders, but all working as herders at the time.\n*11 rothé born that season, 2 of them stillborn.\nHouse Hunzrin sometimes replenished its herds with stolen animals, such as one white ram from the Ched Nasadan House Zinard.\nDespite having its farming activities disdained by other drow, many still acknowledged its value and service to the city as one of the most significant food suppliers. House Hunzrin shared allegiances with House Baenre and House Barrison DelArmgo.\nIn 1412 DR, Shakti Hunzrin became the Matron mother of House Hunzrin. By 1484 DR, House Hunzrin was the Eleventh House and still under the command of Shakti Hunzrin.\nKinuere HunzrinMatron mother in 1361 DR.\nShakti HunzrinHigh priestess of Lolth and Vhaeraun later matron mother (1484 DR)."
