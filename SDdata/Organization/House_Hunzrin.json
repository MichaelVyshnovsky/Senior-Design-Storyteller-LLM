They employed [[orc]] and [[goblin]] slaves to care for the herds. \n\nIn [[1361 DR]], after many drow and slaves were killed in the attack upon [[Mithral Hall]], the rothé herds were in a poor state. [[Shakti Hunzrin]], on leave from [[Arach-Tinilith]] to look after the herds, reported the following dismal numbers:\n*40 goblins; half of them herders, half of them breeders, but all working as herders at the time.\n*11 rothé born that season, 2 of them stillborn.\n\nHouse Hunzrin sometimes replenished its herds with stolen animals, such as one white ram from the [[Ched Nasad]]an [[House Zinard]].",
