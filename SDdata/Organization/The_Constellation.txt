The '''Constellation''' was a [[wizard|sorcerous]] society in [[Zakhara]] that was composed entirely of [[astrologer]]s.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78">

==Organization==
Only [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] were found within the Constellation, but the membership was roughly equal between men and women. As of {{Yearlink|1367}}{{AQ-time}}, there were fifteen members of this group. The Constellation did not actively recruit new members unless one of their current members died.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

The group was founded during the mid–11{{th}} century [[DR]] by a woman known only as the [[Matriarch]]. She was still alive and well and in control of the Constellation as of 1367 DR. The Matriarch was considered the most powerful astrologer throughout the Land of Fate, so the other astrologers within the Constellation followed her every command without question, unwilling to risk her ire and lose access to the priceless star charts of the observatory.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

The priceless star charts were managed by an individual called the [[Keeper]]. Other members of the Constellation would often curry favor with the Keeper by offering gifts in exchange for access to the charts.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

The [[Scribe]] was tasked with updating the star charts. This was performed on a monthly basis for a three day period.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

==Activities==
Members of the Constellation studied the stars in order to gain magical insights to enhance their [[spell]]s and other powers. They spent the vast majority of their time secluded within an observatory studying the night sky. All major astrological events including shooting stars, the appearance of star formations, and the visibility of planets, were recorded on massive charts contained within the observatory.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

An astrolger who dutifully studied the observatory's star charts for an eight hour period could temporarily raise their spellcasting abilities for a lunar month. This could only be done once per year per astrologer, and the Matriarch was resrictive about who gained this kind of access to the star charts.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

Astrologers who spent a few hours studying the star charts could determine the exact outcome of a future event. The distance in the future of the event depended on how much time was spent studying the charts to a ratio of one week for each hour spent studying. This activity was strictly regulated by the Matriarch so that it was not abused.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

==Tactics==
Contrary to most organizations in Zakhara, the Constellation did not have a spy network to gather information throughout the Land of Fate. The Matriarch believed their accurate predictions negated the need to waste human resources in the field for such matters. This was an area of hot debate within the organization as some believed that while accurate, the information received from predictions could arrive too late to be used.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

==Base of Operations==
An isolated observatory deep within the [[Great Anvil]] served as the base of operations for the Constellation.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

==Relationships==
Given their relative isolation from other groups of power, many societies in Zakhara did not view the Constellation as a threat to their ways. The [[Red Eyes]], a group of wicked [[human]] [[Sorcerer (kit)|sorcerers]], wanted to send an [[invisible stalker]] to spy on the Constellation, but were worried the creature would get caught by a [[genie]] en route through the Great Anvil.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

Powerful independent astrologers were sometimes granted access to the Constellation's star charts if they were trusted by the Matriarch.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

The Constellation sometimes worked alongside members of the [[Society of Shifting Sands]] since their paths often overlapped in their search for ancient artifacts. When the two groups worked together it was agreed that the Constellation would be given any texts or items related to the stars or related magic, and the Shifting Sands could take anything else. The Constellation provided the Shifting Sands with detailed navigational aid as well as predictions on the success of their quests.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

The [[Mechanician's League]] also worked closely with the Constellation by constructing intricate [[orrery|orreries]] for them in exchange for their services in predicting the outcome of various mechanical experiments. The Mechanician's League sometimes went against the predicted advice of the Constellation, often with deadly results.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>

Viziers through Zakhara sought the advice of the Constellation, though the astrolgers were careful to never divulge any information that provided military advantage.<ref name=TCSH-p75-78"/>
