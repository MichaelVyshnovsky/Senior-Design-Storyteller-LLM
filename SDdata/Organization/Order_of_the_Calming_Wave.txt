The '''Order of the Calming Wave''' was a [[monastic order]] in service of [[Valkur]] in the 14th century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Members of the order traveled the world by land and sea, spreading the teachings of Valkur.

==History==
The order was formed by a group of pirates who ran into a fierce storm. After the crew had survived the storm, the captain decreed the storm was the doing of [[Umberlee]], and that it had been Valkur that saved them. This lead to the crew abandoning their pirating ways in favor of Valkur's service.
