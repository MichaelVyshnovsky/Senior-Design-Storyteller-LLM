The Order of the Calming Wave was a monastic order in service of Valkur in the 14th century DR.
Members of the order traveled the world by land and sea, spreading the teachings of Valkur.
The order was formed by a group of pirates who ran into a fierce storm. After the crew had survived the storm, the captain decreed the storm was the doing of Umberlee, and that it had been Valkur that saved them. This lead to the crew abandoning their pirating ways in favor of Valkurs service.
