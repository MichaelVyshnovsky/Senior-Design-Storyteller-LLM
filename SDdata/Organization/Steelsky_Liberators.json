        "mainbody": "The '''Steelsky Liberators''' were a group of rebel crusaders and [[dragon]] slayers who fought to free the lands of [[Abeir]] from draconic oppression since ancient times.",
        "History": "The Steelsky Liberators were founded in ancient times on Abeir, when a group of rebel crusaders learned to use the power of an ancient divine blessing on the [[Arambar (energy)|arambar]] that was granted to mortals to combat dragons. The group vowed to free those under the yoke of dragons and to watch over and protect the lands that were free of dragons. These rebels operated mainly in the lands of [[Laerakond]].\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] of {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the practices of the Steelsky Liberators spread into [[Faer没n]] when some of the [[dragonborn]] and [[genasi]] crusaders that survived this catastrophe were transported to the lands of Faer没n. They were among the founders of the kingdoms of [[Tymanther]] and [[Akan没l]], and passed on their abilities to individuals that were seeking more power and knowledge to defeat dragons oppressing their lands.",
        "Abilities": "The abilities of the Steelsky Liberators were of [[Divine magic|divine nature]], and were focused to kill dragons or creatures of [[elemental]] nature. The practices of the Steelsky Liberators also granted a degree of resistance against [[charm]] and [[fear]] abilities."
