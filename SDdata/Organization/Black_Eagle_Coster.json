They would purchase locally made food stuffs like grain, cheese, ale and salted meats and sell them out in [[Hillsfar]], [[Harrowdale]] and [[Scardale]], to be sold and shipped overseas.\n\nThe company's ownership consisted of a five-man partnership of former adventurers led by the swordsman [[Iletian Blackeagle]]."
