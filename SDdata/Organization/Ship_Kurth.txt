Ship Kurth was one of the five factions of Luskan ruled by a High Captain. It was named for and originally led by High Captain Kurth.
By the 1480s DR, Ship Kurth operated a tavern on the northern bank of the city called One-Eyed Jax. The tavern was well known for providing foreigners a good place to sleep, but it was also frequented by drow. High Captain Beniago Kurth frequently posted caravan notices on a board in the tavern.
Ship Kurths base, known as Kurth Tower, was located on Closeguard Island, connected to the southwest part of the city by a bridge. The island was located on the way to the Host Tower of the Arcane on Cutlass Island.
After (or rather, in fact, during) Lord Brambleberry and Captain Deudermonts assault on Luskan in the , Ship Kurth became the public face of the drow mercenary band Bregan Daerthe, lead by Jarlaxle and Kimmuriel Oblodra.
Ship Kurth was originally founded by High Captain Kurth. In the 1400s, Beniago, a drow agent of Bregan Daerthe, infiltrated the Ship and became a lieutenant. By 1484 DR, he had become the High Captain.
