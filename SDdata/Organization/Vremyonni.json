Many vremyonni were kept alive for eons by longevity magic.\nVremyonni were expert weaponsmiths and magic item creators.\nOn very rare occasions, vremyonni would fight in the defense of Rashemen.\nVremyonni used secrets of magic that even the Witches of Rashemen did not use, destructive spells forbidden among the wilds of Rashemen, in case such magic was needed.\nThe Running Rocks harbored secret strongholds of the vremyonni. \nAll vremyonni wore masks."
