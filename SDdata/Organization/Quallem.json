        "mainbody": "The Quallem family was a noble family of Dordrien in the area that later became Daggerdale.\nThe head of the family was recognized to be Lady Quallem.\nAs a noble family of Dordrien, the Quallem family resided near Dordrien Keep in the Dagger Hills. The Quallem familys status among the nobles of Dordrien was significant enough for it to have a sizable crypt set aside for it only a few miles north of Dordrien Keep.\nSometime after the fall of Jhaamdath in , a Jhaamdathan noble, Dordrien, founded a small enclave of survivors on the western slopes of the Dagger Hills. Although the realm lasted little more than a century before orc attacks spelled its demise, in that time the Quallem family managed to rise to a point of prominence that meant they were honored with a place in the Dordrien Crypts.\nDuring Lady Quallems time as the head of the family, she had a son with some degree of skill as a wizard. Both of them were interred in the family vault. However, Lady Quallem herself could not rest easy while her last descendants body was not buried in the family tomb. Therefore she rose as a ghost and remained shackled to the family crypt, even as late as 1372 DR.\n* Lady Quallem, head of the family"
