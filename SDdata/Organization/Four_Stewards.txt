The Four Stewards were an advisory council that helped to rule the kingdom of Akanûl.
The Four Stewards oversaw specialized sections of government, while the monarch of Akanûl controlled the major actions of government. They ruled from their own private fiefdom, known as a thronemote. The four offices were called the Steward of the Earth, the Steward of Fire, the Steward of the Sky, and the Steward of the Sea. 
Although the Four Stewards primarily existed as administrative assistants and advisers, they also held a considerable amount of power over Akanûls monarch. By royal decree, the Four Stewards were legally empowered to override the king or queens authority through a unanimous vote. However, should there be any split in the ranks, the monarchs word remained law.
Steward of the Earth
The Steward of the Earth was in charge of "understanding" the landscape —both political and geographical— of Akanül. For that reason, the Steward of the Earth headed up the spy network of Akanûl, 
Steward of Fire
While it was considered that the Steward of Fire served as the general of the Akanülan army,  
Steward of the Sky
The Steward of the Sky, also known as the Lawgiver of Airspur, served as the final arbiter of disputes and enforced the laws of Akanûl. All judges and lawyers of the kingdom were appointed and employed by the Steward of the Sky. Although this theoretically granted the Steward of the Sky great power, they had no direct control over who was brought to trial, as that was the domain of the Steward of Fire. Additionally, the monarch’s judgment was the highest law, and they could overrule the Steward of the Sky’ rulings.
Steward of the Sea
The Steward of the Sea was also known as the Lord of Coin and oversaw the business of the realm.
Circa 1430 DR, Queen Cyndra established the "Covenant of Stewardship", creating the office of the Four Stewards to balance the power of the ruling monarch of Akanûl.
The Four Stewards consisted of four genasi ministers, each of them representing one of four elements — fire, earth, water, and wind —, who were elected to the position by the nobles of Akanûl every ten years. 
As of 1479 DR, the Four Stewards were
* Lehaya, Steward of the Sky
* Magnol, Steward of Fire
* Myxofin, Steward of the Sea
* Tradrem Kethtrod, Steward of the Earth
As of 1479 DR, all Stewards of the Sea had been individuals known for their corruption.
