        "History": "Clan Licehair was known for the attention its bachelorettes gave to the young warriors of Clan Stonehand, following their defeat of the [[black dragon]] [[Zarkursk]] and inheriting its massive [[gem]] hoard. The Clan Licehair women's attempts to marry the Clan Stonehand warriors was so unwanted that [[Kurgin Stonehand]], the leader of Clan Stonehand commissioned the creation of ''[[Dwarven belt of charming|dwarven belts of charming]]'' to make the young warriors unappealing even by low dwarfish standards."
