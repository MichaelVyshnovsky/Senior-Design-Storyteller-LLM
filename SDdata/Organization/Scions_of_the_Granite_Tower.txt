The '''Scions of the Granite Tower''' were a group of swordsmen and women operating out of the [[Granite Tower]] in western [[Vaasa]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The Scions were charged with defending the Granite Tower, and did so with a combination of swordsmanship, stealth, and strength. They did not necessarily remain at the Tower to protect it, and would sometimes travel{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|79}} Each Scion was trained to wield a [[sword]] from an early age, and was generally a skilled [[fighter]] or [[swordmage]].

==Possessions==
The Scions' signature weapons were the powerful ''[[darksword]]s'', which had been gifted to their ancestors as part of a pact with [[Melegaunt Tanthul]], a [[Prince of Shade]]. A Scion rarely traveled without their ''darksword''.

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, members of this group considered themselves "blood scions" of [[Bodvar the Black]], the leader of their people who formed the pact with Melegaunt Tanthul in the {{YearlinkName|1269}}.{{Cite dragon/281/Rogues Gallery: Heroes of the Summoning|81}} Their ancestors included not only the original wielders of the ''darkswords''&mdash;the [[Moor Eagle]] tribe of Vaasa&mdash;but those original wielders' descendants who aided Melegaunt a century later in bringing about the [[Return of the Archwizards (event)|Return of the Archwizards]] in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.{{Cite dragon/281/Rogues Gallery: Heroes of the Summoning|83}} 

==Members==
The ranks of the Scions were limited in size by the fact that only twenty ''darkswords'' were made for their people. 

While their Moor Eagle ancestors had all been [[human]], the Granite Tower had welcomed a pair of [[elves]] in 1372 DR, and soon their [[half-elven]] descendants became eligible to wield the ''darkswords'' as well.
