        "The [[Menzoberranzan]] dogs are not worth our time. We will achieve more for Queen Lolth than they ever will. When we rule [[Cormyr]], and its occupants are our [[slave]]s, there will come a time to settle old debts.\n|High Priestess [[Hekta Szind]]'s missive\n}}": "=Activities==",

This was all organized by High Priestess [[Hekta Szind]] in order to find the [[Thread of the Weave]] for her Queen [[Lolth]].

        "Activities": "Szind specialized in intelligence-gathering, [[alchemy]], their [[wizard]]s, and the creation of [[undead]]. They relied on [[House Dun'Robar]] for direct military assistance and [[Avithoul]] for (living) slaves. Their business of selling undead made them one of the wealthiest and most powerful houses in the city, and they were hard at work developing techniques to create smarter, stronger, and more loyal undead.",
        "Headquarters": "The estate of House Szind was located inside of Sschindylryn, and contained spacious laboratories and chambers for magical experimentations and the storage of their undead. Thanks to their wealth, it was exceptionally large and luxurious. They did not keep living house servants, but rather a force of shambling undead that performed manual labor under the direction of necromancers.",
