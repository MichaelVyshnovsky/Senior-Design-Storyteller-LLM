        "mainbody": "The League of Noted Singers and Performers was a famous guild of performers that operated throughout ancient Netheril.\nThe guild was made up of actors, singers, artists, mimes, and puppeteers who contributed to performing theatrical plays.\nThe League was the second-most popular band of performers in Netheril behind the Singers and Thespians Guild of Opus. However, the League was exceptionally hard-working and performed more tours, resulting in far more people seeing their plays. They used the works of playwrights that included Alamos (tragedies), Alciati (heroic loners), and Greengreve (dramatic adventures). In the final years before Karsuss Folly they shied away from plays that could be interpreted as being subversive or critical of Netheril, and tried to stay in business by being politically neutral.\nThe Leagues base was near the center of Eileanar enclave, in the shadow of Karsus Castle."
