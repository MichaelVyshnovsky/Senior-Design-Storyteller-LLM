'''House Cormaeril''' was a noble house of [[Cormyr]]. Their estate was situated beyond the [[Royal Gardens]] in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]]. The family had been, at a point, the largest noble family in the kingdom.A branch of the family had become the rulers of the region of [[Daggerdale]].{{Cite dungeon/192/Backdrop: Daggerdale|5,6}} 

==Relations==
House Cormaeril was an enemy of the [[Illance]] house. The Cormaerils also had a long-standing rivalry with [[Huntcrown|House Huntcrown]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail}}

==History==
In the 14th century DR, House Cormaeril was the largest noble family in Cormyr, and also the realm's largest landowner, not counting the crown itself. Most of their holdings was farmland, providing the house significant income, which they hoarded.  The Cormaeril had members throughout the ruling structure of Cormyr, having a presence in every council and court in the kingdom. They used their power sparingly but effectively, were awed and feared among the landed nobility, and were one of most secretive 
families.

The family had a minor branch in [[Immersea]]. 

After the [[Fire Knives]] were driven from Cormyr in the {{YearlinkName|1341}}, it was found that a number of members of the Cormaeril family were in fact members of the Fire Knives. They were also implicated in the assassination attempt on King [[Azoun IV]] in the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, so the Crown exiled the family and confiscated their lands.

Though they lost their standing in Cormyr, a branch of the family came into power in [[Daggerdale]]. This lordship passed to the family after it's lord, [[Randal Morn]], died of pneumonia in the {{YearlinkName|1391}}. His only known heir was his younger sister, [[Silver Cormaeril]], who had become a member of the noble house by marriage. She succeeded him to the Dagger Throne, leading it to be inherited by her son (Randal's nephew), [[Sathrin Cormaeril]].{{Cite web/Ed Greenwood's Patreon/Daggerdale: The Lordless Country}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1414}}, King [[Azoun V]] restored the elements of the house that had remained loyal. The Cormaeril's titles were restored, but not their lands. As of [[1479 DR]], the family was attempting to restore their reputation through generosity to the poor and patronage of the arts.{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|17}}<ref name= "dragon365-p46">{{Cite dragon/365/Backdrop: Cormyr|46}}

Up until the 1480s DR, the Daggerdale branch still ruled the region from their seat in [[Castle Daggerdale]].
