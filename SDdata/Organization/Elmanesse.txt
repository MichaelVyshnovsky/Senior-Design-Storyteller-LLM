The Elmanesse was a tribe of copper elves in the Forest of Tethir. 
The tribe was formed when elves fled the fall of Myth Drannor and settled in Tethir.
While the tribe was primarily concerned with protecting its tribal lands from humans, a cell of the Eldreth Veluuthra infiltrated the group with hopes of finding the ancient city of Myth Rhynn around 1374 DR.
