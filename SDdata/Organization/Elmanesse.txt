The '''Elmanesse''' was a tribe of [[copper elves]] in the [[Forest of Tethir]]. 

==History==
The tribe was formed when elves fled the fall of [[Myth Drannor]] and settled in Tethir.

While the tribe was primarily concerned with protecting its tribal lands from [[human]]s, a cell of the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]] infiltrated the group with hopes of finding the ancient city of [[Myth Rhynn]] around [[1374 DR]].

==Notable Elmanesse==
