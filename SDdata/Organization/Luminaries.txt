The '''Luminaries''' were a sect of [[warlocks]] who drew their power from the [[primordial]] known as [[Telos]], and who served functions similar to those of [[priest]]s in [[Vaasa]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}}

==Organization==
Luminaries were recruited from among the [[nishaadhri]], the spellcasters bound in service to the [[Warlock Knights]] of Vaasa. Only nishaadhri who had attained high status were extended an invitation to join this elite group. The Luminaries themselves were independent of the Warlock Knights, although both organizations served the [[Voice of Telos]].

==Activities==
Telos worship was the ''de facto'' state religion in Vaasa under the Warlock Knights,{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|83}} and because Luminaries were the rough equivalent of Telos's priests, they were the most fanatical of the primordial's warlocks and worshipers. even as their leader advocated for honoring the sleeping primordial's will.

The primary duty of the Luminaries was to preside over the temples and shrines dedicated to Telos,

The Luminaries were charged with reinforcing the Warlock Knights' armies by creating crazed constructs&mdash;known as [[shardsouls]]&mdash;by fusing pieces of Telos's soul into bodies made of ''[[ironfell]]'' mined from his body.

==Possessions==
Luminaries favored ''ironfell'' [[morningstar]]s in combat and wore ''[[ironfell ring]]s''. They dressed in gray [[robe]]s with veils.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Perilous Bastion|9}} 

==History==
The Luminaries were founded by the Voice of Telos sometime after Telos fell to [[Toril]] during the events of the [[Spellplague]].

As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, some of these priests were secretly worshipers of [[Bane]], calling their loyalty to Vaasa into question.

When [[Castle Perilous]] mysteriously rejuvenated in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a Luminary led the investigation into what had happened.
