        "mainbody": "The '''Olympian pantheon''' was a tight [[pantheon]] of gods, They were sometimes called the '''Greek pantheon''',<ref> including by its own members,<ref> as that was the name of a collection of city-states on [[earth|another world]] where they were worshiped. The members of this pantheon were little known in the Realms, but had some degree of influence or power to grant spells in [[Realmspace]].\n\n{{Quote|For all their vaunted talk of freedom, they sure make a lot of rules!|''An [[Olympus|Olympian]] [[petitioner]] about to descend to the [[Gray Waste]]''}}",
        "Description": "The members of this pantheon largely resembled [[human]]s,\n\nThe Olympians were largely uninterested in innovation, with the exception of some members like [[Hephaestus (deity)|Hephaestus]], as they chose to focus on emotional and spiritual matters rather than the technological. And they tended to offer their aid to mortals indirectly, as it was the preference of [[Zeus]].<ref>\n\nThough they were a tight pantheon, and not as chaotic as the [[Norse pantheon]] and [[Seldarine]], they were still not very cohesive due to some of the more chaotic aspects of their personalities, which Zeus encouraged to a certain extent. It was not uncommon for them to cause mishaps for their fellow members' followers. They were also rather insular, being neither open nor welcoming of new deities, preferring to display their pantheon's might by crushing new deities under their heel before bringing them into the fold.",
        "Base of Operations": "The members of this pantheon chiefly resided upon [[Mount Olympus]], Some thought the Olympians all lived atop the mountain's snowy heights, It was only Zeus and Hera who lived atop the mountain, within a great citadel of polished [[gold]] and [[marble]].\n\nThe deity [[Poseidon]] resided within [[Ossa]], Arborea's second layer, though maintained a seaside shrine near Mount Olympus. [[Pan (deity)|Pan]] and [[Prometheus]] lived in the hinterlands of Olympus, rarely visiting the mountain proper. Both [[Hades (deity)|Hades]] and [[Hecate]] had [[divine realm]]s in the plane of [[Hades]], which was connected to Mount Olympus by the latter's twisting caverns. Hades lived in the [[Pluton|third layer]] of the plane that shared his name, while Hecate had a divine realm in both the third layer of Hades<ref group=\"note\" name=\"note1\">''[[Tales of the Outer Planes]]'' identifies Hecate's divine realm as residing on [[Phlegethos]], the fourth layer of the Nine Hells, but the later books ''[[Guide to Hell]]'' and ''[[Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of the Nine Hells]]'' change its location as being in the third layer, [[Minauros]].\n\nWithin a location on the mountain known as the Vast Temple, the Olympians kept a book of their pantheon's history. Bound in the bones of mythical creatures and fallen heroes, the ''Great Theogony'' recounted the emergence of the [[multiverse]] from their perspective.",

            "Related Deities": {
                "Gaea": ": The grandmother and great-grandmother of the various Olympian powers.",
                "Rhea (deity)|Rhea": ": The mother of the first six Olympian powers."
            },
            "Servants": "Almost all members of the Olympian pantheon worked through [[proxy|proxies]]. Some allowed these to ascend, but others like Zeus were very reluctant to grant such power out of fear of being usurped. Apollo, Ares, and Athena favored the use of [[per]]s and [[solar]]s.\n\nMany of their most notable servants were legendary heroes. One such proxy was [[Circe|Circe the Black Sorceress]], a long time servant of the goddess Hecate. In addition to proxies, the Furies acted as divine servitors of the pantheon as a whole, avenging personal slights or horrible crimes committed against the Olympians, though they would also unleash vengeance upon the Olympians for any crimes they committed."
        },
        "History": {
            "History on Toril": "Over the course of the planet of [[Toril]]'s history, there were waves of planar immigrants that came from the aforementioned collection of city-states and a [[Wikipedia:Ancient Roman|land of empire and glory]], both of whom worshiped the Olympian gods. One wave settled in the kingdom of [[Bakar]], in the city of [[Medinat Muskawoon]]. There they constructed temples to the Olympian gods, such as Prometheus and Tyche, with several temples to Prometheus spanning the [[River Athis]]. Another wave settled around the time of the rise of [[Netheril]] and from them the goddess Tyche would go on to become worshiped in the [[Netherese]] people's [[Netherese pantheon|pantheon]] until the [[Dawn Cataclysm]].<ref>\n\nDuring the Dawn Cataclysm, Tyche manifested herself into two separate forms, the goddesses [[Tymora]] and [[Beshaba]], who would go on to become members of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]]. What ultimately became of her would be unknown to the rest of the Olympian pantheon.\n\nSome time after that, Hermes began a romance with the goddess Tymora, which was known to only a few on Olympus. Some claimed this was solely him trying to learn the fate of Tyche. Also around this time, both Hermes and Pan were sending their avatars out across the cosmos in search of the truth of Tyche's demise, but they were unable to send them to [[Realmspace]] proper. Eventually the two would resort to sending priests through portals to Toril to uncover the truth."

        "Relationships": "The Olympians got along well with the Seldarine, as they never competed for land or followers, And the [[celestial eladrin]] in general were on good terms with them.\n\nThe [[Celtic pantheon]] was considered their primary rival due to its opposing, open-minded and tolerant nature. And the pantheon as a whole embraced the deity [[Nebelun]], who for a time camped within the workshop of Hephaestus.\n\nSome individuals in this pantheon had relations with deities of other pantheons that were worshiped on [[Toril]]. For instance, Hephaestus was one of the closest allies of the [[dwarven pantheon|dwarven deity]] [[Dumathoin]] and was supplied by him with [[adamantine]] ore.{{FRCS-Unearthed Legends}} Hermes was often visited by the [[halfling pantheon|halfling deity]] [[Brandobaris]]{{FRCS-Unearthed Legends}} and occasionally had conversations with [[Selûne]]. Throughout their time knowing each other, the goddess Demeter had always gotten on well with the [[Chauntea]]. And the goddesses of beauty [[Hanali Celanil]] and [[Sune]] shared their crystal fountain pool of [[Evergold]] with Aphrodite.<ref><ref>",
        "Worshipers": "[[File:OlympianTemple.png|thumb|273px|''A standard Olympian pantheon house of worship.'']]\nThe original worshipers of this pantheon were largely humans. Those who did could be of any [[alignment]] and choose any of the following [[divine domain]]s:\n:[[air domain|Air]], [[Animal domain|Animal]], [[Chaos domain|Chaos]], [[Charm domain|Charm]], [[Community domain|Community]], [[Creation domain|Creation]], [[Death domain|Death]], [[Destruction domain|Destruction]], [[Earth domain|Earth]], [[Evil domain|Evil]], [[Fire domain|Fire]], [[Good domain|Good]], [[Healing domain|Healing]], [[Knowledge domain|Knowledge]], [[Law domain|Law]], [[Luck domain|Luck]], [[Trickery domain|Trickery]], [[War domain|War]], [[Water domain|Water]], or [[Weather domain|Weather]]. \nPolygots were known to ask each of the Olympian pantheon's deities for intervention in matters that reflected their interests. Such as asking Athena for an oracular vision or asking Hades for the ability to ''[[repel undead]]''.\n\nAcross multiple [[crystal sphere]]s, this pantheon was venerated as part of the [[Planar Church of Olympus]], which had [[Planar Church of Olympus (Bral)|a sect]] in [[Realmspace]].\n\nWithin the [[Outlands]] city of [[Sigil]], there stood temples to Apollo,<ref> Hermes,<ref> and Zeus. Some of the proxies of these deities could also be found within the city, specifically within [[Sigil/The Lady's Ward|The Lady's Ward]].<ref> Also in the Outlands, the [[gate-town]] of [[Sylvania]] had a large temple to the pantheon as a whole.<ref>\n\nIn regards to the planar factions that resided in Sigil and elsewhere, Hades was revered by the [[Dustmen]], Athena and Zeus by the [[Fraternity of Order]], the Furies by the [[Mercykillers]], Zeus by the [[Sign of One]], Aphrodite by the [[Society of Sensation]], and Tyche by the [[Xaositects]].\n\nIn [[w:c:spelljammer:Greatspace|Greatspace]], the [[good]]-aligned Olympians were worshiped and Zeus was believed to be the creator of the crystal sphere. Some people in Greatspace believed that the evil members of this pantheon, such as Hades and Hecate, didn't exist and were just rumors started centuries ago.\n\nHades was also worshiped by one group of humans within the [[Astromundi Cluster]] under the name of Yul.<ref>"
