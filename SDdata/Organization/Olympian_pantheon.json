        "mainbody": "he Olympian pantheon was a tight pantheon of gods, They were sometimes called the Greek pantheon, including by its own members, as that was the name of a collection of city-states on another world where they were worshiped. The members of this pantheon were little known in the Realms, but had some degree of influence or power to grant spells in Realmspace.\nThe members of this pantheon largely resembled humans,\nThe Olympians were largely uninterested in innovation, with the exception of some members like Hephaestus, as they chose to focus on emotional and spiritual matters rather than the technological. And they tended to offer their aid to mortals indirectly, as it was the preference of Zeus.\nThough they were a tight pantheon, and not as chaotic as the Norse pantheon and Seldarine, they were still not very cohesive due to some of the more chaotic aspects of their personalities, which Zeus encouraged to a certain extent. It was not uncommon for them to cause mishaps for their fellow members followers. They were also rather insular, being neither open nor welcoming of new deities, preferring to display their pantheons might by crushing new deities under their heel before bringing them into the fold.\nThe members of this pantheon chiefly resided upon Mount Olympus, Some thought the Olympians all lived atop the mountains snowy heights, It was only Zeus and Hera who lived atop the mountain, within a great citadel of polished gold and marble.\nThe deity Poseidon resided within Ossa, Arboreas second layer, though maintained a seaside shrine near Mount Olympus. Pan and Prometheus lived in the hinterlands of Olympus, rarely visiting the mountain proper. Both Hades and Hecate had divine realms in the plane of Hades, which was connected to Mount Olympus by the latters twisting caverns. Hades lived in the third layer of the plane that shared his name, while Hecate had a divine realm in both the third layer of HadesTales of the Outer Planes identifies Hecates divine realm as residing on Phlegethos, the fourth layer of the Nine Hells, but the later books Guide to Hell and Fiendish Codex II Tyrants of the Nine Hells change its location as being in the third layer, Minauros.\nWithin a location on the mountain known as the Vast Temple, the Olympians kept a book of their pantheons history. Bound in the bones of mythical creatures and fallen heroes, the Great Theogony recounted the emergence of the multiverse from their perspective.\nAthena.png|thumb|Athena, the Olympian of war and wisdom\nOlympianHades.png|thumb|Hades, the Olympian of death\nHera.png|thumb|Hera, the Olympian of marriage\nApollo\n The Olympian god of healing, light, and music.\nAthena\n The Olympian goddess of war and wisdom, whom some speculated was also the goddess Sune or at least similar to her.Although the text says \"Athena\", it more likely means Venus or Aphrodite, as they are all goddesses of love and beauty, while Athena is not. Furthermore, \"Sune\" is the final four letters of \"Venus\" reversed.\nArtemis\n The Olympian goddess of hunting and beasts.\nDemeter\n The Olympian goddess of agriculture and the wife of Zeus prior to Hera.\nEchidna\n Also known as the \"Mother of Monsters,\" was an Olympian goddess trapped within the 73 layer of the Abyss. Her lair was dominated by a massive, white marble statue that depicted her as a nymph with the lower body of a serpent.\nThe Furies\n A trio of lesser goddesses that embodied divine vengeance.\nHera\n The Olympian goddess of marriage and the wife of Zeus.\nHades\n The Olympian god of the dead.\nHecate\n The Olympian goddess of magic.\nHephaestus\n The Olympian god of crafting and smithing and the sole child of Hera.\nHermes\n The Olympian god of commerce, thievery, and travel.\nPan\n The Olympian god of nature and passion.\nPoseidon\n The Olympian god of the ocean,\nPriapus\n An Olympian god of fertility that was worshiped by primitive human tribes on the Isle of Firando.\nPrometheus\n A lesser titan who aided the Olympians in their battle of usurpation and was later granted a station of lesser godhood within the pantheon.\nTyche\n The Olympian goddess of fortune.\nZeus\n The Olympian god of the sky and the head of the pantheon.\nGaea\n The grandmother and great-grandmother of the various Olympian powers.\nRhea\n The mother of the first six Olympian powers.\nAlmost all members of the Olympian pantheon worked through proxies. Some allowed these to ascend, but others like Zeus were very reluctant to grant such power out of fear of being usurped. Apollo, Ares, and Athena favored the use of pers and solars.\nMany of their most notable servants were legendary heroes. One such proxy was Circe the Black Sorceress, a long time servant of the goddess Hecate. In addition to proxies, the Furies acted as divine servitors of the pantheon as a whole, avenging personal slights or horrible crimes committed against the Olympians, though they would also unleash vengeance upon the Olympians for any crimes they committed.\nMany of the members of this pantheon descended from a group of beings known as the greater titans.Not to be confused with the dawn titans or the true giant race known simply as the titans. They were born by a pair of gods known as Gaea and Uranus. Gaea went on to birth more monstrous children, most notably the hecatoncheires, and Uranus imprisoned them all. Some accounts told of them being locked up inside Gaeas earthen depths, while others told of them being locked up in the bowels of Carceri. Either way, over time Gaea grew sick with the state of things and convinced her son Cronus to overthrow her father, so long as he would then free his monstrous brethren. Cronus did so, wounding his father so severely that he allegedly perished. The blood from his wounds fell upon Gaea, fertilizing her once more, causing the creation of the Furies and the gigantes.\nCronus then married the titan Rhea, Fearful of the curse, Cronus devoured each of his first five children These first five children were Demeter, Hades, Hera, Hestia, and Poseidon.\nOn their sixth child, a furious Rhea tricked Cronus into instead swallowing a stone in swaddling clothes. This gave Gaea the chance to smuggle the child away, one who would later be known as Zeus, and leave him in the care of nymphs on a remote island. When he reached adulthood, Zeus returned disguised as one of Cronuss cupbearers and gave him a potion that induced him into vomiting up his five other children.\nIn the history of this pantheon its squabbling members had gathered together on a common front primarily on two occasions. The first was to usurp the Titans, and some of the lesser titans that allied with them. These included Prometheus and many others.\nNot wishing for any of her children to be imprisoned, following the Titanomachy Gaea tried sent the gigantes and a hundred-headed dragon against the Olympians to liberate and avenge the Titans. Her monstrous creations brought the Olympians to their knees, but the new generation of gods ultimately held up against them.\nThe second major time the Olympians came together on a common front was the construction of Mount Olympus. The legitimacy of this second act was questionable though, as some claimed that the mountain had existed since before the Titans had even ruled Olympus. Others told of them taking credit simply for fashioning it into a continuous conduit through the Astral plane and into Hades, connecting along the way to all places on the Prime where they had followers, though some claimed this too had existed prior to them.\nOver the course of a few thousands years following their founding, the Olympians grew to be among the most influential pantheons on the Outer Planes. To the point that many people on the Prime Material referred to their home plane as Olympus, though not the inhabitants of Realmspace. Though they also garnered many enemies, such as when they appropriated portfolios from what would later be known as the Mulhorandi pantheon, blatantly drawing from their rivals to gain ever more worshipers.\nOver the course of the planet of Torils history, there were waves of planar immigrants that came from the aforementioned collection of city-states and a land of empire and glory, both of whom worshiped the Olympian gods. One wave settled in the kingdom of Bakar, in the city of Medinat Muskawoon. There they constructed temples to the Olympian gods, such as Prometheus and Tyche, with several temples to Prometheus spanning the River Athis. Another wave settled around the time of the rise of Netheril and from them the goddess Tyche would go on to become worshiped in the Netherese peoples pantheon until the Dawn Cataclysm.\nDuring the Dawn Cataclysm, Tyche manifested herself into two separate forms, the goddesses Tymora and Beshaba, who would go on to become members of the Faer√ªnian pantheon. What ultimately became of her would be unknown to the rest of the Olympian pantheon.\nSome time after that, Hermes began a romance with the goddess Tymora, which was known to only a few on Olympus. Some claimed this was solely him trying to learn the fate of Tyche. Also around this time, both Hermes and Pan were sending their avatars out across the cosmos in search of the truth of Tyches demise, but they were unable to send them to Realmspace proper. Eventually the two would resort to sending priests through portals to Toril to uncover the truth.\nThe Olympians got along well with the Seldarine, as they never competed for land or followers, And the celestial eladrin in general were on good terms with them.\nThe Celtic pantheon was considered their primary rival due to its opposing, open-minded and tolerant nature. And the pantheon as a whole embraced the deity Nebelun, who for a time camped within the workshop of Hephaestus.\nSome individuals in this pantheon had relations with deities of other pantheons that were worshiped on Toril. For instance, Hephaestus was one of the closest allies of the dwarven deity Dumathoin and was supplied by him with adamantine ore. Hermes was often visited by the halfling deity Brandobaris and occasionally had conversations with Sel√ªne. Throughout their time knowing each other, the goddess Demeter had always gotten on well with the Chauntea. And the goddesses of beauty Hanali Celanil and Sune shared their crystal fountain pool of Evergold with Aphrodite.\nthumb|273px|A standard Olympian pantheon house of worship.\nThe original worshipers of this pantheon were largely humans. Those who did could be of any alignment and choose any of the following divine domains\nAir, Animal, Chaos, Charm, Community, Creation, Death, Destruction, Earth, Evil, Fire, Good, Healing, Knowledge, Law, Luck, Trickery, War, Water, or Weather. \nPolygots were known to ask each of the Olympian pantheons deities for intervention in matters that reflected their interests. Such as asking Athena for an oracular vision or asking Hades for the ability to repel undead.\nAcross multiple crystal spheres, this pantheon was venerated as part of the Planar Church of Olympus, which had a sect in Realmspace.\nWithin the Outlands city of Sigil, there stood temples to Apollo, Hermes, and Zeus. Some of the proxies of these deities could also be found within the city, specifically within The Ladys Ward. Also in the Outlands, the gate-town of Sylvania had a large temple to the pantheon as a whole.\nIn regards to the planar factions that resided in Sigil and elsewhere, Hades was revered by the Dustmen, Athena and Zeus by the Fraternity of Order, the Furies by the Mercykillers, Zeus by the Sign of One, Aphrodite by the Society of Sensation, and Tyche by the Xaositects.\nIn Greatspace, the good-aligned Olympians were worshiped and Zeus was believed to be the creator of the crystal sphere. Some people in Greatspace believed that the evil members of this pantheon, such as Hades and Hecate, didnt exist and were just rumors started centuries ago.\nHades was also worshiped by one group of humans within the Astromundi Cluster under the name of Yul."
