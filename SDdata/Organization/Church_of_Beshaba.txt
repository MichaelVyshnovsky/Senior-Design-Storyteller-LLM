The '''Church of Beshaba''' was a collection of malicious [[cleric]]s, [[mystic]]s, and specialty priests called [[doommaster]]s devoted to [[Beshaba]], the Maid of Misfortune. 

==Organization==
The hierarchy of the Beshaban clergy was dominated by priestesses. Titles within the clergy in order of ascending rank included Bewildered, Unfortunate, Finger of Fear, Hand of Strife, Higher Hand of Strife, Hand of Gloom, Higher Hand of Gloom, Hand of Horror, Higher Hand of Horror, Hand of Despair, Higher Hand of Despair, Mistress of Dread, and Nails of the Lady. The Nails of the Lady as of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, was [[Dlatha Faenar]]. 

==Activities==
Clerics of Beshaba were required to spread her worship by striking the fear of her notorious bad luck into the hearts of those they encountered. 

==Celebrations==
Beshaba's faithful recognized several important ceremonies including [[the Passing]], when one of their own died, and [[the Marking]], when someone ascended in rank. Anyone wishing to avoid Beshaba's attention could attempt another ceremony to [[Appeasing Beshaba|appease]] her. 

==Base of Operations==
The [[Spires Against the Stars]] was the most holy site of Beshaba located in [[Faer√ªn]]. 

==Dogma==
Beshabans believed that bad luck could happen to anyone and that by following Beshaba they could avert the worst of it. Clergy were encouraged to make others worship Beshaba out of fear and to spare themselves. 

==Orders==
* The [[Black Fingers]] was a group of male assassins who killed in the name of their goddess.
* [[Wormlucks]] were an order of clerics known for wearing bright red robes over their armor and ill-fitting white wigs to emulate their Goddess and to serve as a warning to others that ill luck may be around them.
