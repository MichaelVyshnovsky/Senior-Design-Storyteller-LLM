They ran drug-running and slave trade operations in southern Thay, Mulhorand, and Unther. The Cult continued performing ritual sacrificies, but without divine support these were mostly for show, intended to thrill their followers and slay their enemies.\n*Malabeth Trrudena, a priestess who was suspected of being a spy for Lolth."
