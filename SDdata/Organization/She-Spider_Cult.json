        "Activities": "After losing the favor and divine support of both Lolth and Shar, the She-Spider Cult changed direction, becoming instead a secret criminal organization. They ran drug-running and slave trade operations in southern Thay, [[Mulhorand]], and [[Unther]]. The Cult continued performing ritual sacrificies, but without divine support these were mostly for show, intended to thrill their followers and slay their enemies.",
