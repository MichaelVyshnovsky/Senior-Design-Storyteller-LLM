        "orgname": "the Cajaan Dynasty",
        "mainbody": "The '''Cajaan Dynasty''' was the second of four dynasties of the [[Third Age of Calimshan]].",
        "Description": "The members of this dynasty were among the nobility of [[Calimshan]] before their rise to power.",
        "Organization": "While remaining [[priest]]-rulers like the [[bakkal]]s before them, the leaders of the Cajaan Dynasty were the first of the [[Calishite]] rulers to use the title of \"[[Pasha]]\" as the official name for the [[caleph]] of Calimshan.",
        "Base of Operations": "Their seat of power was located in the city of [[Calimport]].",
        "Signet": "The symbol used by the Cajaan Dynasty was a fiery sun pierced by three arrows pointing down and to the left.",
        "Activities": "The Cajaans re-instituted the worship of the [[One Sun]], a sun deity first acknowledged by the [[Erehnir Dynasty]] and worshiped by the [[Vahlen Dynasty]].\n\nTrade with [[Netheril]] was common during their rule, particularly with the Netherese city of [[Tzindylspar]], the City of Rubies. [[Rubies]] flowed freely into Calimshan and were coveted by rich Calishite nobles, who even used the gems as currency.\n\nDuring their rule, the Cajaans also established an [[emir]] as ruler over the northern territories of [[Tethyr]]. The emir was traditionally the third son of the ruling pasha. the emir would rule from that city.\n\nThe Cajaans began their rule by enhancing the defenses of the nation, but as the dynasty drew on, they grew lax and dismissive of threats to their power.",
        "Technology": "During the time of the Cajaan Dynasty, the [[human]]s of Calimshan first began adapting the technology of the [[bow]] from the [[elves]]. Prior to this, the humans only used [[atlatl]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[iron]] [[sword]]s. Having acquired a few captured elven [[longbow]]s, they developed [[Shortbow|shorter versions]] that could be used from [[horse]]back or from [[chariot]]s.",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Rafak el Cajaan]], the dragonslayer who led the assault against [[Ylveraasahlisar|the Rose Dragon]].\n* [[Nadim el Cajaan]], a [[sorcerer]]-prince who led a small army to conquer the Netherese city of Tzindylspar.\n* [[Violir el Cajaan IX]], the dynasty's final ruler.",
        "History": "The Cajaan dynasty began when a band of human dragonslayers from the Cajaan family, drove [[Ylveraasahlisar]] the Rose Dragon from her throne in Calimport in {{Yearlink|-1726}}. However, there was infighting among them as to who would take the throne for eighteen years, until finally, in {{Yearlink|-1708}}, the last surviving male heir established himself as pasha of Calimport and the supreme ruler of the nation of Calimshan.\n\nIn {{Yearlink|-1700}}, the same year that the [[syl-pasha]]'s third son became the emir of Tethyr, Calishite nobles began hunting elves for sport. War erupted with the elves of the [[Forest of Tethir]] in {{Yearlink|-1530}}, who grew tired of being hunted for sport. Battles between the elves and the Calishites of the  emirate of Tethyr would continue until well after the fall of the dynasty.\n\nThe dynasty also had to deal with slave uprisings and civil war in its northern emirates.\n\nBattles with the [[Alimir Hive]] of [[beholder]]s had been ongoing since before the dynasty began and continued throughout this time. In {{Yearlink|-1550}}, one of these battles started a fire that consumed the eastern [[Darthiir Woods]]—later called the [[Forest of Mir]]—reducing it in size to the borders it would hold until the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\nIt was the beholders who ended the dynasty. In {{Yearlink|-1428}}, the beholders led an army of [[goblin]]s and [[ogre]]s and successfully conquered every city of Calimshan and [[Iltkazar]]. Pasha Violir IX believed that the One Sun would save his kingdom, but he was [[Flesh to stone|turned into stone]] on the steps of his temple in Calimport. The [[beholder mage]] [[Qyraaptir]] then \"sat\" on the throne of Calimport.",
        "Trivia": "[[Cajaan Sabban]] in [[Grand Ward]] of Calimport was named for this dynasty. The ''[[sabban]]'' mark was the fiery symbol used by the dynasty."
