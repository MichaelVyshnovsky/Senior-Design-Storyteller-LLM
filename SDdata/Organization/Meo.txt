The '''Meo''' family was a noble family based in the city of [[Xai Chung]] in [[Koryo]]. They had an ancestral mansion there.

Around [[1350 DR]], the [[king of Silla]] ordered the children of [[Meo Yungdo]]—[[Meo Cha]] and [[Meo Li]]—be kidnapped and sold into slavery. His reason remains unknown; it may have been for leverage against Yungdo, or in cruel revenge over some perceived offense. Fortunately, Meo Cha and Meo Li were reunited and managed to escape. They eventually returned safely to Koryo, where the tyrant king had abdicated and their father became advisor to the new king, [[Wanang Sun]], by [[1357 DR]].
