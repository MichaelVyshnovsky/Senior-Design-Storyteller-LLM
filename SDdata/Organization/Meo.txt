The Meo family was a noble family based in the city of Xai Chung in Koryo. They had an ancestral mansion there.
Around 1350 DR, the king of Silla ordered the children of Meo Yungdo—Meo Cha and Meo Li—be kidnapped and sold into slavery. His reason remains unknown it may have been for leverage against Yungdo, or in cruel revenge over some perceived offense. Fortunately, Meo Cha and Meo Li were reunited and managed to escape. They eventually returned safely to Koryo, where the tyrant king had abdicated and their father became advisor to the new king, Wanang Sun, by 1357 DR.
