The Simbulmyn, also known as the Simbuls Guard, was the personal guard of the Simbul.
Human, elven, and half-elven members of the Simbulmyn were given powerful enchanted bracers that granted them iron will and unnatural toughness.
In 1374 DR, the Simbulmyn was commanded by High Captain Hovor Seawind.
