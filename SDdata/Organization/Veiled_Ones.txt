The '''Veiled Ones''', or '''"talibund"''', were the group of adventurers formed by [[Elminster Aumar]] in [[1369 DR]] who defeated the [[Cult of the Dragon]]'s [[Kya Mordrayn]] and her [[dracolich]] ally, [[Pelendralaar]], fulfilling the prophecy of the ''[[Song of Faerûn]]'' preformed in [[Kara-Tur]] at the dawn of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The Veiled Ones were a group of adventurers, heroes, and survivors, who were bound together by a fate prophesied in the ''[[Song of Faerûn]]'' and their mysterious ability to be hidden from divinations of the future.

==Base of Operations==
Even though the Veiled Ones were an accidentally-assembled adventuring group, they remained together after the events in the Myth Drannor and remained active in [[Phlan]] and the wider [[Moonsea]] region.

==Possessions==
During their adventures, the Veiled Once collected (and lost) some of the more unique and rare [[enchanted]] items of the ruined City of Song, including the unique ice shard [[dagger]], the ''[[Borea's Blood]]''; a powerful ''[[mageshield]]'';; a duo of spell-proof ''[[mantle ring]]s'';; the ''[[sacred staff of sunlight]]''; and a ''[[spellstaff]]'', among others.

For their mission to stop the Cult of the Dragon, they were entrusted with the powerful ''[[Gauntlets of Moander]]'' by [[Elminster]].

==History==
[[File:The veild ones resting.jpg|thumb|alt=|''The Veiled Ones recuperating after a tough battle.''|340x340px]]
The Veiled Ones were brought together in [[1369 DR]], when Elminster Aumar put the call for heroes out after the ''[[pool of radiance]]'' under the city of Phlan mysteriously returned after a decade of being inactive. The ''pool's'' magics started affecting the citizens of New Phlan, slowly draining them of their life energy. Elminster entrusted an accomplished [[warrior]] [[Athan]] with the ''Gauntlets of Moander'', the enchanted artifact that saved the city in the past from the corrupted ''pool of radiance''. Athan's band assembled heroes and volunteers and set out to the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]] following Elminster's directions.

Athan's expedition, although it was not the group later known as the Veiled Ones. They were [[Ghleanna Stormlake]]; a [[wizard]] and Elminster's apprentice; [[Durwyn]], a city guard from Phlan; [[Kestrel]], a [[thief]] who promised to stand guard over the resurfaced pool under the influence of [[firewine]]; and [[Corran D'Arcey]], a nobleman [[paladin]] of [[Tyr]]. Once the guardians of the ''pool'' assembled in the pool chamber underneath [[Valjevo Castle]], a ''[[gate]]'' opened, showing Athan and his band being massacred. Ghleanna rushed through without second thought. Overly zealous, Corran grabbed Kestrel by the hand to stop a thief from escaping and forced her and himself through the ''gate'' to attempt and aid the adventurers in trouble. As the duo was moving within the gate, its magic became unstable. Kestrel used her [[grappling hook]] to pull them to the safety of the other side, and Durwyn trapped the rope the last moment and followed them.

The reluctant heroes emerged on the other side of the usable ''gate,'' but they were too late to help Elminster's band. They were greeted by scorched earth and dead bodies of [[Allyril]], [[Loren]], and several others. Athan's body was nowhere to be found as well as the ''Gauntlets of Moander''. The heroes encountered [[orc]]s scavenging through the possessions of the dead and disposed of them as Corran D'Arcey took the lead. Committed to finishing Athan's mission, despite Kestrel's reluctance, they headed into the ruins of Myth Drannor. Shortly they came across a [[halfling]] "entrepreneur" [[Nottle]], rescuing him from the restless walking dead. Grateful, the help, little thief, introduced the adventurers to [[Faeril]] and [[Beriand]], survivors of the mysterious attack on Athan's gang. The survivors provided the Veiled Ones with shelter and a warm meal, as well as the way to enter the sprawling underground complex of the [[Dwarven Dungeons]]. As a favor, Beriand asked the adventurers to recover his [[staff]], the ''[[Deathbane]]'' from marauding orcs.

The following morning the heroes entered the dungeon. The complex eventually led the heroes to [[Jarial]], a [[wizard]] who's been trapped in stone since [[1353 DR]]. Cursed by his lover [[Ozama]], the wizard remained untagging and alive until Kestrel solved the puzzle and freed him. Grateful and lovely after years of solitude, Jarial joined the adventurers, hoping to find out what happened to his lover. Together, the group encountered the collector of necklaces who murdered Ozama years back, [[Preybelish]], a [[dark naga]]. With negotiations failing, the heroes faced the venomous spell-slinging creature in combat, slaying the beast. In the naga's trove they found the ''[[Wizard's Torc]]''. Further into the dungeons, the group came across [[humanoid]] creatures that resembled humans with lizard-like or [[draconic]] features. Myth Drannor's corrupted mythal changed the [[Cult of the Dragon]] members. The heroes rescued one of the Athan's gang, a warrior named [[Emmeric]] who joined the group on their next task - recovering the ''[[Ring of Calling]]'' that would allow them to move to the next part of the ruined city, the [[Speculum Grounds]]. The group remained at odds with each other, torn between Kestrel's and Emmeric's pragmatism and Corran's straightforward strategy that endangered them every hostile encounter. Subsequently, Coran's lack of strategy and selflessness led the group to confront a group of Cult of the Dragon wizards. Emmeric was killed by a deadly ''[[lightning bolt]]'' during the confrontation, to Corran's shame. But the Veiled Ones ended up rescuing Nottle from the Cult in the process.

[[File:Gargoyle load screen.jpg|thumb|''The Veiled Ones, about to face yet another danger of the ruined [[Myth Drannor]] -savage [[gargoyle]]s and [[margoyle]]s.''|340x340px]]
During their trek through the dungeons, the Veiled Ones encountered many challenges, such as recovering the stolen ''Deathbane'', standing against two warring orcish groups of [[Mol the Great]] and [[Zud]], freeing the [[ormyrr]] [[Sharpstick clan]] from the mind-controlled chief [[Pujik]], and returning them the land taken from the ormyrr by the marauding humanoids.

Soon after finding a way out of the Dwarven Dungeons, the heroes encountered an ancient elven seer [[Caalenfaire]] and his loyal floating skull [[Volun]] in the old dragon-shaped grand structure of the [[Speculum]]. The ancient creatures revealed to the heroes that they were the Veiled Ones, heroes whose future was clouded from the seer's sight and who were destined to free the City of Song from the Cult of the Dragon occupation. The [[diviner]] pointed the heroes towards several allies in the ruins who were destined to help them in the quest: [[Odelinde]] the Golden Serpent;

The Veiled Ones found Anorrweyn Evensong's spectral shrine to her goddess - [[Mystra]] and helped her return to full power, reuniting the elf's body with her stolen skull. For that quest, Faeril joined the group, anxious to help the priestess of her goddess. Anorrweyn pleaded with the heroes to restore the ''mythal'', badly damaged by the clumsy magics of Kya Mordrayn. The only way to do it was to replace the ''[[Gem of the Weave]]'', the magical focus and communication interface with the great ''mythal''.

With the ghost's guidance, they traveled to the [[House of Gems]] and restored the ancient magical and mechanical water pumps, giving strength to the ghost of the Dwarf Lord Harldain Ironbar. Harldain's dwarves created the original gem used as the ''Gem of the Weave'', and the ghostly lord found a worthy replacement - a giant [[emerald]] to become the new ''Gem of the Weave.'' In order to heal the ''mythal'', the Veiled Ones needed to confront the Cult, destroy the gem, and allow Anorrweyn Evensong to become the new guardian of the ''mythal''.

Eventually, the Veiled Ones gained entrance to [[Castle Cormanthor]] with the help from a shaky alliance with [[Nathlilik Kilsek]] of the [[drow]] [[House Kilsek]] who were betrayed by the Cult of the Dragon and the drow of [[House Freth]]. Fighting off soulless drow, [[dragonkin]], the cultists, and rescuing [[Athan]], the Veiled Ones eventually reached the chamber of the ''pool of radiance''. Kestrel faced the evil sorceress Kya Mordrayn and successfully summoned the disgraced baelnorn to destroy the corrupted ''gem of the weave'' in the Cult's possession. Miroden Silverblade sacrificed his unlife, destroying the gem, and in the process, incinerating the cultists, leaving Mordrayn alone to face the rogue. After a long and fierce spell battle, Kestrel used ''Borea's Blood'' to finish the sorceress off. Instead of dying, however, Kya Mordrayn was ragged to the [[lower planes]] by the creatures she made a pact with to reach her villainous goals. The fight was not over, as Pelendralaar arrived to aid his ally. The heroes fought tooth and claw, and eventually, with Corran D'Arcey's bravery, they destroyed the mighty undead dragon. Athan used the ''Gauntlets of Moander'', claimed from the sorceress, to drain the ''pool of radiance'' and the heroes returned to the city of Phlan to help the Moonsea recover from the devastating event. Anorrweyn Evensong merged with the ''mythal'', slowly fixing the corruption, and Faeril elected to stay behind, along with Beriand, to help with the priestess.
