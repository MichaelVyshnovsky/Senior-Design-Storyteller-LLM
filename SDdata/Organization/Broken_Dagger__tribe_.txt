The '''Broken Dagger''' tribe was a tribe of [[goblin]]s dwelling in the north of the [[Vast Swamp]] of [[Cormyr]] and in the [[Spiderhaunt Wood]] in [[Shadowdale]].<ref group="note">Two goblin tribes named "Broken Dagger" have appeared in different locations. They might be unrelated tribes, related, or one tribe migrating between two locations. For convenience, both are included here.

==Relationships==
Around 1367 DR, Broken Dagger territory in the Vast Swamp was bordered in the south by the territory of [[Darkstar]] [[orc]]s, and otherwise surrounded by [[troll]] bands.

==History==
The Broken Dagger tribe was known to live in the Vast Swamp around [[1367 DR]].

At around that time, the Broken Daggers of the Spiderhaunt Wood were among the goblin tribes in the forest victimized by another goblin tribe, the so-called [[Noble Cavalier]]s, and the allies of the ''[[Dragonking's Eye]]''.
