The '''Silver''' family of [[half-elves]] was a noble house of [[Aglarond]] descended from the [[Yuir]] [[elves]] of the [[Yuirwood]].

They kept peaceful relations with the [[human]]s during the conflicts of the era. [[Silverhall]] in [[Velprintalar]] was the traditional family home.

Around [[1368 DR]], [[Donya Silver]] was a sorceress and personal friend of [[Alassra Silverhand|the Simbul]]. Around this time, the house's members served in the [[Aglarond]]an army and traded with neighboring nations in [[east Faer√ªn]].
