        "mainbody": "'''The Church of Shar''', also referred to as the '''Night Church''', was the organization dedicated to spreading the dogma and carrying out the wishes of the deity [[Shar]]. It existed throughout much of its history as independent cells that often acted in opposition to one another, and were forced by intolerance to practice their faith underground. After years of rapid growth, the Sharran religion eventually emerged as one of the preeminent faiths of the [[Heartlands]] in the 15{{th}} century, and even the state religion of the returned empire of [[Netheril]].\n\n{{Quote|In the darkness of night, we hear the whisper of the void.|[[Rivalen Tanthul]], Shar's Nightseer.}}",
        "Etymology": "Members of the church knew each other as '''Dark Followers''', or '''Martyrs''',The novel ''[[The Fractured Sky]]'' repeatedly misspells this term as 'Sharan'. or '''Darshars''', a bastardization of '''Dark Sharran'''.",
        "Dogma": {
            "Tenets": "Shar's faithful were taught to transcend fear and loss suffered by members of the weaker faiths. Each member of the church maintained their [[Church of Shar#Admittance|\"Own Secret\"]] with Shar, pertaining to their proof of devotion to her service.\n\nClergy members followed Shar's 'Thirteen Truths', foundational beliefs that formed the core of their faith. Among these were:\n* Love is a lie. Only hate endures.\n* Light is blinding. Only in darkness do we see clearly.\n\nHidden with a [[The Leaves of One Night|holy Sharran tome]] was Shar's Fourteenth Truth:\n* All is meaningless. And nothing endures.",
            "Attitude": "The atmosphere of the organization was one of unwavering faith to its leader, Shar herself. Disobeying an order usually resulted in death. Although devotees were perfectly willing to give their life for Shar, she did not want to deplete the number of her dedicated followers. An element of fear was associated with the worship of Shar since many of her followers were willing to give their lives in her service.",
            "Chronology": "The church of Shar maintained an alternate Roll of Years that corresponded to that written by [[Augathra the Mad]], known as the [[Black Chronology]]."

        "Organization": {
            "Titles": "[[File:Sharran priestess 2.png|thumb|right|200px|A Darklady of Shar, performing a sacrificial killing.]]\nThe church of Shar utilized a number of different titles for its clergy. \n\nHundreds of years before [[Dale Reckoning]], titles the church included:\n* ''Dark Heart'', the leader of a temple.\n* ''Mother/Father Night'', used to address superior priests.\n* ''Sister/Brother Night'', used among most of Shar's clergy.\n\nBy the mid–14{{th}} century they had changed to:\n* ''Flame of Darkness'', an archpriest or direct servant of the Lady of Night.\n* ''Nightseer'', the overpriest for the faithful within a given realm.\n* ''Darklady/lord'', a senior priest that led a single cell.\n* ''Hand of Shar'', an experienced priest that led Sharrans in battle or on quests for the church.\n* ''Watcher'', the lowest-ranking order of the priesthood.\n* ''Adept of the Night'', the title given to novice priests and priestesses.\n\nAround a century later, the titles were simplified to include:\n* ''Dark mother/father'', leaders within the faith, with the suffix ''abbot'' or ''abbess''\n* ''Dark sister/brother'', fully-trained clergy members.\n* ''Initiate'', novice members of the church.",
            "Classes": "The church of Shar comprised [[cleric]]s, [[crusader]]s, [[mystic]]s, and the order of [[specialty priest]]s known as the [[nightcloak]]s. These priests were known as \"nightbringers\", and previously served a different role outside the clergy, but were brought within the church's embrace ''circa'' [[1364 DR]]. \n\nSharran priests that offered exemplary service to the Lady were ''[[resurrection|resurrected]]'' after their death and augmented in ways pleasant to the faith. They became known as the Shadowed. These devotees were granted new powers, such as that to ''[[gaseous form|become insubstantial]]'', and were greatly feared by their fellow clergy.",
            "Admittance": "Due to the perception of Shar's church among most folk of the Realm, open recruiting for new members was not an option. Novitiates of the faith—whether they served as spies, agents, or clergy within the temples—were brought aboard individually, a process that sometimes took an inordinate amount of time. Sharran clergy often sought out secrets held by prospective members, and manipulated them to secure desired converts.\n\nIn order to become clergy within the church's organization, a supplicant had to undergo a test of faith and commitment to the faith. They were required to commit an act of horrific violence, often murder, against one of their loved ones. This vile act—combined with the priest's unique name bestowed upon them by Shar—formed their Own Secret.\n\nTo become a worshiper of Shar, the tests were less strenuous, but nonetheless involve performing acts that would be considered deplorable by kindhearted individuals. Any betrayal of the faith resulted in the swift death of the formerly-faithful.\n\nPotential recruits incapable of murder were not admitted, and would likely be killed. After a few months of displaying their willingness to join, new recruits have likely committed many murders.",
            "Factions": "Because the church was fractured into smaller cells, it was very common for different sects of the Sharran faith to emerge, each often associated around strong and charismatic priest that led a given cell. In some cases these became 'heretical' in the eyes of rival cells, creating conflict and strife between clergy members.\n\nOne faction of the Church of Shar was dedicated to eliminating any knowledge of the shadow weave that did not originate from the church itself. They believed that anyone outside the church with such knowledge was a threat to their security. They have been known to recruit adventurers for the purposes of eliminating the individuals in possession of such knowledge.\n\nFissures erupted within the church, especially in [[Amn]], surrounding the [[Dark Moon heresy]], the belief that Shar and [[Selûne]] were two aspects of the same goddess."

These often involved aiding political rebellions, murdering those that attempted to maintain order, and otherwise sowing lawlessness across the Realms, with the exception of cities and lands where open worship of Shar was the norm. On some occasions, Shar's priests were directed to murder spellcasters  she deemed guilty of misusing [[Shadow Weave|her own source of magic]]. Other times they were directly forbidden from dispensing this form of punishment, seemingly without reason or pattern. \n\nAnyone slain by the Dark Followers were always to be informed their death was in Shar's name.",

All the faithful were required to perform this ritual once per [[tenday]]. [[Coming of the Lady]] was the name given to Nightfall when it coincided with moonless nights. This special ritual required the congregation of Shar to commit an act of retribution or depravity in Shar's name.\n\nThe [[Kiss of the Lady]] was considered the most important rite of the faith, one in which her priests reveled in ritualistic murder and other horrific deeds. It was not held regularly, only when decreed by the leaders of certain influential sects of the church. that bestowed upon the recipient the ability to [[shadow walk|walk through]] the [[shadowstuff]] substance, that originated from the Shadowfell.",
        "Celebrations": "To maintain secrecy, the Sharran church only held one holy day on the [[Calendar of Harptos]], the [[Rising of the Dark]] held on the night of [[Uktar 30]] and early morning of [[Nightal 1]]. While others were distracted themselves by paying tribute to the dead, clergy members used the time to perform their darkest rituals and receive instructions of the faith for the upcoming winter.\n\nTemples of Shar were closed during the daytime hours during [[Moondown]], in the [[tenday]] that preceded [[Midsummer]].",
        "Tactics": {
            "Magic": "It was not uncommon for priests of Shar to utilize the power of her [[Shadow Weave]] for spellcasting. Despite this, Shar held onto the deepest and most powerful secrets of the magical force as her own.\n\nLearning from their [[Shadovar]] allies of [[Thultanthar]], clergy of Shar employed [[shadow simulacrum|simulacra]] made from the shadows of victims they slew. These shadowy constructs were then used in infiltration missions to replace the slain target, and serve as spies or act in their stead on behalf of the church."

            "Regions": "As the ancient faith of Shar dated as back back as the empire of [[Netheril]], it spread across Faerûn and Sharran cells appeared in cities far and wide. [[Calimshan]] emerged the preeminent place for Sharran worship throughout the [[Lands of Intrigue]]. The presence of the powerful Old Night sect allowed the faithful to gather, share information, and coordinate with one another with relative ease and security.\n\nShar's worship took root in the region of the [[Underdark]] known as [[Great Bhaerynden]], in the depths beneath the [[Great Rift]]. A Sharran cell was formed by an unlikely group of disaffected [[gold dwarves]] that were exiled from the dwarven kingdom.\n\nSecretive but influential cells appeared throughout the cities and realms of the [[Western Heartlands|Western]] and [[Eastern Heartlands]], such as [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Wheloon]] in [[Cormyr]],\n\nThe Sharran faith was openly practiced in [[Scornubel]], [[Westgate]], [[Calaunt]], and [[Mulmaster]]. that survived for centuries in the Shadowfell only by the grace of Shar's faithful.",

Centuries later, the Lady of Loss was often represented as a black sphere haloed in purple flames or a beautiful, black-haired woman with an unnerving smile. Some depictions showed her wearing an elaborate metal mask and wielding dual blades, held in a cross over her chest.",

            "Dress": "Priests and priestesses of Shar preferred garments of black highlighted with purple. Ceremonial dress included long-sleeved, deep purple robes worn over black clothing, with a black skullcap worn atop the head. Priestesses with black hair abstained from wearing the cap, as their natural tresses were seen as a natural blessing by the Lady of the Night. In olden times, all clergy either dyed their hair or used magic to make it black in hue, while wearing [[item enchantment|enchanted]] wigs made of the hair of others was a more recent practice. Clergy often adorned themselves with jewelry made of [[obsidian]], [[onyx]], [[purple jade]], or [[amethyst]]s. \n\nSharran clergy made use of [[nightcloak (garment)|nightcloaks]], magical garments that offered the wearer soundless movement and the power of flight. Some Dark Followers chose to walk during the hours of the night, covered only in these magical cloaks. \n\nA specific type of [[item enchantment|enchanted flower]] known as a ''[[camellia of the Black Lady]]'' was sometimes worn in the hair of Sharran devotees, used to inflict the Lady's vengeance upon a victim of their choosing.",

        "History": {
            "Age of Humanity": "[[File:Sharrans.png|thumb|right|300px|Ancient Sharrans, spreading the faith among the heretics.]]\nThe worship of Shar dated back to when mortals first appeared on [[Toril]].\n\nSome time after the {{YearlinkName|648}}, thieves working for the church stole a copy of the ''[[Book of Black]]'' and the original ''[[Leaves of One Night]]'' from the [[Dark Diviners]] of [[Windsong Tower]], the latter of which reportedly included a great weakness of the Lady of Loss.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1182}}, the [[Waterdhavian]] cell of Shar's church led by [[Vanrak Moonstar]] enjoyed a significant victory when he slaughtered nearly all the inhabitants of the Selûnite [[High House of Stars]] in the city.\n\nFinally in the {{YearlinkName|1345}}, all out war broke out in Waterdeep between the churches of Shar, and those of [[church of Lathander|Lathander]], [[Church of Selûne|Selûne]], and [[church of Tempus|Tempus]].",
            "Early Era of Upheaval": "After Shar killed [[Ibrandul]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the Dark Lady assumed his divine [[portfolio]] and gained the power to take on the form of his [[avatar]]s. Ibrandul's followers—including [[goblin]]s, [[kobold]]s and [[troglodyte]]s—unknowingly offered their worship to Shar in his place, in effect growing the number of her \"faithful\".\n\nAround this time, as of {{Yearlink|1369}}, the highest ranking mortal member of the Church was high priestess [[Irtemara el Eradsari]] of the [[Temple of One Night]] in [[Calimport]].\n\nDuring the early 1370s DR, nearly every Sharran cell across the Western Heartlands came under the influence of the Lady's [[divine disciple]], [[Damian Krale]]. The imposing cleric was hand-picked by Shar to carry out her secret plan for the region, known only to him and a handful of local head priests.\n\nAs of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Sharran faith was believed to have around 3,500 clergy members, with an estimated one hundred thousand worshipers overall.\n\nThat same year the former [[chosen]] of [[Mask]] [[Kesson Rel]]—an otherworldly, quasi-divine being interred within the Shadowfell—emerged as an emblematic savior of the Sharran faith in Sembia within the Eastern Heartlands. It was believed by the increasingly-influential sect in Saerloon that Kesson Rel alone could bring upon Shar's [[Cycle of Night]] over Toril.\n\nTo further the Lady's goal of replacing the Weave of Mystra with Shar's own Shadow Weave, her clergy attempted to create [[dead-magic zone]]s all across Faerûn.",
            "Shadows Over Sembia": "{{Quote|When the moon's light is stricken form the Night sky, Lord Volumvax will stand trimumphant with the blood of Selûne on his hands. His is the foresight needed to plunge Toril into the [[Eternal Dark]]...|Temple credo of the [[Darkhouse]] of Saerloon.}}\n\nIn [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, a mere few of Shar's servants operating independently of one another orchestrated the [[Sembian Civil War]] and laid the path for the church to take hold of the entire realm. In service to Lord [[Volumvax]] (an alias of the [[shade]] Kesson Rel) Rivalen meanwhile ingratiated himself with [[Thamalon Uskevren II]] of Selgaunt, and defeated them with the aid of the returned enclave of [[Sakkors]]. \n\nUnbeknownst to Rivalen, Shar's will directed Elyril to recover and read from the ''Leaves of One Night'' in Volumvax's name. Using the holy Sharran artifact, Elyril opened the [[Shadowstorm]] over Ordulin during the Rising of the Dark and rew the [[pocket plane]] known as the ''[[Adumbryl Calyx]]'' from the Shadowfell, granting Kesson Rel and his army of shadows admittance to Faerûn.\n\nAfter their shared victory at Selgaunt, Rivalen manipulated Thamalon II into seizing the position of Sembia's Overmaster for himself, and over time, transformed the nation into vassal-state of the returned Netheril.",
            "War and the Weave": "Just as war and the Shadowstorm wreaked havoc across Sembia, Sharran clergy working from a [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|false temple]] of Mystra in [[Wheloon]] carried out Shar's will in neighboring Cormyr. Shar's faithful took over the [[Lost Refuge]] in the [[Vast Swamp]] and reopened the ''[[Dusk Lord's Passage]]'', another ''portal'' that linked Faerûn to the Shadowfell. Operating from within the [[Black Rift]] of the Shadowfell, [[Esvele Greycastle]] and the [[black dragon]] [[Despayr]], led a group of Sharrans in a ritual that would tear the Weave apart, using practitioners of [[the Art]] afflicted by the ''[[shadow shard]]''. They were ultimately unsuccessful. Shar's dragon was defeated, but Greycastle continued on the Lady's work.\n\nIn [[Uktar]], along with [[Fzoul Chembryl]] and the [[Army of Darkhope]]. She supported the [[Zhentarim]] during their army clashed with [[Army of the Myth Drannor|the forces]] of [[Myth Drannor]] during the [[Cormanthor War]], and aided the church's new allies during their attempted takeover of Shadowdale. On [[Nightal 1]], during the Rising of the Dark,  the drow of House Dhuurniv launched raids against Shadowdale and the [[Zhentilar]] began their occupation of the dale, under the guise of military aid. \n\nMonths later in the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, while the Dalesfolk were distracted with their Zhent occupiers, Esvele Greycastle worked with the lich [[Alokkair]] and the Shadovar emissary [[Irphiina]] of Thultanthar to complete the [[Rite of Unwinding]] with in her [[House of Night|underground temple]]. They attempted to nullify the Weave over an ever-expanding area, without actually destroying it, thus allowing the Shadow Weave to become the dominant source of arcane power in the Realms. Just as in the Vast Swamp however, Shar's servants were thwarted by a band of meddling adventurers.\n\nThe church's attempts to control, manipulate, or even destroy the Weave would not be thwarted. Later that year clerics of Shar and their Thulanthan allies broke into the [[Windsong Tower]] and stole the ''[[Quess'Ar'Teranthvar]]'', an [[elven]] [[artifact]] that was in fact one copy of the fabled ''[[Nether Scroll]]s'', and stashed it in close proximity to a [[Shadow Weave node]] in [[Anauroch]] for safekeeping. Unfortunately for the clergy, the [[Heroes of Shadowdale]] dissolved the ''Quess'Ar'Teranthvar'' and Shar's faithful were dealt another defeat.\n\nBy that time however the Sharran church had shared their secret of dampening the Weave with their allies in Thultanthar. The Shadovar [[arcanist]]s utilized Thultanthar's ''[[mythallar]]'' to nullify the Weave over much of the Anauroch desert. This granted the Sharran [[arcanist]]s a tremendous edge over other powers in the region, including [[dragon]]s, [[djinn]], and otherwise powerful beings native to the desert.",
