        "orgname": "the Shadowdusk family",
        "mainbody": "'''Shadowdusk''' was a noble family from [[Waterdeep]] that fell into disgrace in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], went into hiding, and was plotting to reclaim its former glory in the late 15{{th}} century DR.",
        "History": "The family built its wealth through trade. Three sisters of the family, [[Arandraya Shadowdusk|Arandraya]], [[Maelweene Shadowdusk|Maelweene]], and [[Yarlithra Shadowdusk|Yarlithra]], sponsored and later even led expeditions into [[Undermountain]], and grew famous.\n\nThe family started contacting powerful beings from the [[Far Realm]], attempting to use them against business rivals and political enemies. However, contact with the Far Realm ultimately drove much of the family to madness, and their strange behavior soured their reputation in the city. Rumors even appeared in local broadsheets claiming the Shadowdusks had been supplanted by aberrant monsters disguised as [[human]]s.\n\nUltimately, in the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, [[Shadowdusk Hold]] was razed with all three sisters killed in the fire. It was commonly believed the [[Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors]] was behind it.\n\nSince the destruction of their ancestral home, many of the family members relocated to [[Undermountain]].\n\n[[Halaster Blackcloak]] monitored the Shadowdusks and groomed them for a violent and victorious resurgence in Waterdeep, in order that he might rule the city through them.",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Dezmyr Shadowdusk]] (daughter of Yarlithra)\n* [[Zalthar Shadowdusk]] (son of Yarlithra)\n* [[Xerrion Shadowdusk]] (brother of Arandraya, Maelweene, and Yarlithra)\n* [[Margaraste Shadowdusk]] ([[archmage]] and wife of Xerrion)\n* [[Skrianna Shadowdusk]]\n* [[Melissara Shadowdusk]]\n* [[Derrion Shadowdusk]]\n* [[Vertrand Shadowdusk]]\n* [[Berlain Shadowdusk]]\n:Other Members\n::[[Tendra Nightblade]] • [[Maleen Shadowdusk]] • [[Cassiok Shadowdusk]]",
        "Motto & Heraldry": "The original Shadowdusk family motto was \"No secrets without truth\". However, following their descent, it became \"We do not fear the darkness\".\n\nTheir crest is a lit torch with three embers rising from the flame, over a purple field. After going mad and moving to Undermountain, it was simply turned upside down."
