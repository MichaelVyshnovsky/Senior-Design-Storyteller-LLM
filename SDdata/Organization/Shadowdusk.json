However, contact with the Far Realm ultimately drove much of the family to madness, and their strange behavior soured their reputation in the city. Rumors even appeared in local broadsheets claiming the Shadowdusks had been supplanted by aberrant monsters disguised as humans.\nUltimately, in the , Shadowdusk Hold was razed with all three sisters killed in the fire.
