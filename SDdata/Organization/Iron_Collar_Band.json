        "mainbody": "The '''Iron Collar Band''' was a [[Cormyr]]ean outlaw mercenary group and later an adventuring band, active in the early 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''So you'd prefer Koluhm's company or that filthy collection of rags that calls himself a [[wizard]]?! A [[pox]] on you, then! You're lucky I don't cleave you from neck to crotch!''|[[Black Geoffrey]]}}",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1312}}, Black Geoffrey and his comrades found themselves in the town of [[Targos]] as the city was being besieged by a [[goblin]] force that served the [[Legion of the Chimera]]. Originally, the group came from the southern nation of [[Cormyr]] where they did mercenary work far from the frigid waters of [[Maer Dualdon]]. They fled the Forest Kingdom due to some unrevealed event involving plundering tombs and being shackled by Cormyr's [[Purple Dragons]]. The group did not regret the flight. The Iron Collar Band was not willing to comply with Cormyr's many laws and fees that governed adventuring companies.\n\nBlack Geoffrey, [[Blanchard Pike]], [[Kickshaw]], and a [[priest]] named [[Koluhm Bonecutter]], all traveled as an \"adventuring band\" and eventually reached the unruly city of [[Luskan]]. There, they met a raggedy [[wizard]], secretly an agent of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]], [[Phaen of the Rags]], who joined the group and told them of \"easy gold\" to be made in [[Targos]] as the town put out a call for adventurers at the time.\n\nThe Iron Collar Band accepted the contract with Targos, the worst possible employment, as far as Blanchard Pike was concerned. On the day when a band of adventurers who would soon become heroes of Targos arrived at Ten Towns, the settlement was attacked, as goblins somehow found a way past palisades and fortifications and started ravaging Targos's docks and warehouses. Geoffrey, Pike, and Kickshaw didn't care for the attack and spent their day drinking and boasting at [[The Salty Dog Tavern]].\n\nKoluhm Bonecutter found himself following his priestly duties in Targos, trying to serve the dead and dying according to the will of his deity's church, and attempted to appease a restless [[ghost]] – the namesake of the [[Weeping Widow]] in just up the cliff from the Salty Dog Tavern and the docks. Phaen of the Rags promptly left the group and camped in an abandoned wainwright's shop not war from the Weeping Widow. The Wizard claimed he wanted \"peace and quiet\" but, in truth, he was the trojan horse that allowed the goblins of the [[Legion of the Chimera]] magical passage to Targos. Geoffrey, Pike, and Kickshaw paid no mind to their companions' behaviors and joked that they left because of Geoffrey rancorous snoring."
