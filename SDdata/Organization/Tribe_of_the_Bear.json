        "History": "During the [[Battle of Icewind Dale]] in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, the Tribe of the Bear attacked the town of [[Termalaine]].\n\nAfter the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, only two Bear tribe chieftains remained: [[Wolvig Barrundson]] and [[G端nvald Halraggson]]. However, Wolvig turned to evil and allied himself with the Ice Witch, also known as [[Hedrun Arnsfirth]], and Hedrun's defeat meant Wolvig's downfall also. Thus G端nvald, as last surviving chieftain, declared himself the Bear King.\n\nSome time before the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, a group of self-exiled tribesmen relocated to the [[Cave of the Berserkers]]. These barbarians devoted themselves to [[Auril]] and became corrupted by the malevolent substance known as [[chardalyn]].{{Template:Cite book/Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden|124}}",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Hjollder]], elder and shaman\n* [[Wolvig Barrundson]], chieftain and servant of the Ice Witch\n* [[G端nvald Halraggson]], chieftain and later king\n* [[Bjami Tengervaald]], the tribe's elder shaman"
