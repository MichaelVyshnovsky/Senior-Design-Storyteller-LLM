The House of Al-Farif was one of the richest merchant families in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Mamluks of the Diligent Mamluk Society and several shairs and wind mages were employed to protect their warehouse. Their guards were a cut above the common guards found within the Warehouse District of Huzuz.
The House of Al-Farif was based out of the Warehouse District of Huzuz.
Al-Farif owned a moderately sized spice warehouse. Though they held fewer and smaller warehouses than many other merchant families, the spices sold by the House of Al-Farif were worth more than their weight in gold.
