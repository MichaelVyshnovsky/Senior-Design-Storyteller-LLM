The '''House of Al-Farif''' was one of the richest merchant families in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Organization==
[[Mamluk]]s of the [[Diligent Mamluk Society]] and several [[sha'ir]]s and [[Elemental mage|wind mages]] were employed to protect their warehouse. Their guards were a cut above the common guards found within the [[Warehouse District of Huzuz]].

==Base of Operations==
The House of Al-Farif was based out of the Warehouse District of Huzuz.

==History==
Al-Farif owned a moderately sized spice warehouse. Though they held fewer and smaller warehouses than many other merchant families, the [[spices]] sold by the House of Al-Farif were worth more than their weight in [[gold]].
