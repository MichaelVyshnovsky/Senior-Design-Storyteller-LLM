The '''Blood Mountain''' tribe was a clan of [[bugbear]]s who dwelt in the [[Giantspire Mountains]].
==Activities==
The tribe had a reputation for savagery. They were known to hunt [[humanoid]]s to collect their severed heads both within the [[Giantspire Gap]], through which the [[Long Road (Northeast Faer√ªn)|Long Road]] ran, and along the eastern edge of [[Damara]].
==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Blood Mountains were known to be one of the most fearsome tribes in the Giantspires. They vied for control over the Giantspire Gap with the [[hobgoblin]]s of the [[Razor Heart]] tribe.
==Members==
The tribe was led by [[Garnuuk]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. Although predominantly a clan of bugbears, their ranks occasionally included [[ogre]]s and [[giant]]s as well.
