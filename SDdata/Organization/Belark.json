        "source": "",
        "mainbody": "The '''Belark''' family was one of the four satraps that held sway in the trading town of [[Delzimmer]] ''circa'' the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]]. Although rivals with the other three families, they kept the peace based on non-aggression pacts negotiated by their ancestors.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|42}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 35: A First Glance at Delzimmer}}",
        "Organization": "The Belarks were a proud family steeped in tradition, disdaining the common people with contempt. In 1373 DR they were led by [[Oldyle Belark]]. Family traits included squat torsos inclined to being fat, with long arms, bowed legs, and black hair. They were not pretty, having the family hooked nose, but they used their brutish appearance to their advantage.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|43}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 36: The Satraps of Delzimmer, Part 1}}\n\nEach satrap had a small, private army of guards that patrolled the streets and kept the peace around the family's interests. Belark soldiers were recognized by their crimson [[leather armor]] and [[buckler]]s bearing the family crest: a black [[hawk]] flying to the sinister on a field of white sky. This hawk symbol was prominently displayed on the gates to Belark property, servant's uniforms, family documents, and business contracts.",
        "Activities": "All the satraps of Delzimmer were in the business of outfitting caravans, warehousing goods, and supplying banking services such as moneychanging and loans to costers, merchants, and trading companies whose goods passed through Delzimmer. The Belarks bred sturdy horses for sale and had extensive business interests in stonemasonry. As a non-business activity, they collected sculptures.",
        "Tactics": "Although the Belarks appeared at first glance to be brutes of low intelligence, they were quite shrewd and could act to validate a stranger's preconceptions in order to glean important information from them. The Belarks did not keep slaves, but were not above using drugs and other methods to coerce unsavory characters like thieves and assassins to do their bidding, or to guarantee a servant's loyalty.\n\nThe family militia were well trained and allowed to carry whatever swords each individual preferred. In addition, they were issued [[hand crossbow]]s with bolts tipped with some form of poison, usually to paralyze the target or put it to sleep, but deadlier poisons were known to be used on occasion.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Belark mansion was located on the block between the [[Wide Way]] and [[Gaunthan Street]] in Delzimmer. It was named Belarkhuruin (from the word \"haroon\" that in the old vernacular meant \"grand house\"), and was made of dark colored stone with many sharply peaked towers. There were gardens surrounding the main house and the whole compound was enclosed by a wall.",
        "Possessions": "The Belarks were enamored with [[gold]] and kept a good portion of their wealth in coins. They owned quite a few masonry companies located in the larger city-states of [[Tashalar]].",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Oldyle Belark]]: Patriarch of the family, ''circa'' [[1373 DR]].\n* [[Hlonsker Belark]]: Eldest son and heir.\n* [[Corauth Belark]]: Second son.\n* [[Aslyn Belark]]: Third son.\nThere were six uncles that did not significantly contribute to the family fortune, but rather the opposite."
