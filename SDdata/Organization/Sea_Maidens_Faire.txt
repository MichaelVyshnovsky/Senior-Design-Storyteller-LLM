The '''Sea Maidens Faire''' was a traveling carnival of entertainers hailing from the city of [[Luskan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Traveling the [[Sword Coast]] in their three ships—the ''[[Heartbreaker]]'', ''[[Hellraiser]]'', and ''[[Eyecatcher]]'', the Sea Maidens Faire performed shows and parades in towns up and down the coast.

The fleet was commanded by Captain [[Zardoz Zord]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1492}},{{Waterdeep-time}} the ''Heartbreaker'' and ''Hellraiser'' were docked in [[Waterdeep]]'s [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]], with the Sea Maiden's Faire carnival erected on the pier between the two ships. The flagship ''Eyecatcher'' was anchored in the harbor.
