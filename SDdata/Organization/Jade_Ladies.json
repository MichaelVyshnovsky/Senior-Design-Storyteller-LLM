They acted at the direction of Shu Chia of the Nine Immortals, God of Artificers and the Arts.\nThey were transparent women who wore magnificent jade headdresses and green robes.\nThey were in charge of creating and burying valuable and lovely things in the earth, namely rare metals and jewels. Their abilities allowed them to create rich amounts of jade in hidden locations and to weave gold, silver, and copper into the veins of stone, which would later be discovered by miners and craftspeople."
