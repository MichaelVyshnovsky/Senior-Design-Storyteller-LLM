{{quote|Had any trouble with the Blackriver Bandits? They make my blood boil, I tell you...|A Bloodsailors thug}}

==Organization==
The gang was led by the swashbuckler [[Vengaul Bloodsail]], with [[Callik|Lieutenant Callik]] as his second-in-command.

==Base of Operations==
The Bloodsailors had several hideouts in the Neverwinter Docks District, including a secret base of operations in the basement of the [[Seedy Tavern]].

==Possessions==
The Bloodsailors had a distinct red and blue uniform that was familiar to many in and around the Docks District, allowing them access to their hideouts and the [[Seedy Tavern]]. This uniform was bestowed on a member of the Bloodsailors when they joined, and was deemed so important to the gang that they would not expect to give it up easily.

==Relationships==
The Bloodsailors had many enemies fighting for territory in the Docks District, the most notable of which was the [[Blackriver Bandits]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Callik betrayed Vengaul and attempted a revolt within the organization. Callik kidnapped Vengaul's girlfriend [[Dara'nei]] and sabotaged Vengaul's attempt to illegally auction off a [[cockatrice]], which was an important component in curing the [[Wailing Death]]. Later the same year, in the wake of the [[Luskan]]-Neverwinter war, Bloodsailors found themselves in a full-on gang war with the [[Blackriver Bandits]] in the streets of the Docks District.
