        "mainbody": "The Doegan Dogs was a pirate fleet allied and sponsored by the emperor of Doegan, Aetheric III, in the mid–14 century DR.\nThe Doegan Dogs main purpose, after allying with Aetheric III, was hunting down ships from the opposing countries of the Five Kingdoms, Ulgarth, the Free Cities of Parsanic, Konigheim, and any other ship that got stuck in the crossfire. Some people theorized that Doegans use of mercenary pirates in the Utter East, and keeping the fleet near the Golden Lands, signaled Aetherics interest in conquering and expanding his empire.\nThe Doegan Dogs made it utterly dangerous to sail to the south of the Free Cities, but other pirating ships and companies did not mind the danger, as the Dogs presence kept the fleets of the Five Kingdoms from raising enough numbers to wipe the Dogs and all other pirates from the Utter Coast.\nIn the mid–14 century DR, the Doegan Dogs were a de facto fleet loyal to the Emperor of Doegan, active to the south of the Free Cities of Parsanic, while Doegans Imperial Fleet was busy fighting the pirates of the Golden Lands further to the south from the Utter East.\nSometime before 1377 DR, a ship that Kurthe Lornar was a part of was burnt down by the Dogs in Port Halovar."
