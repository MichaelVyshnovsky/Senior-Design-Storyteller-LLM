        "mainbody": "The '''Brotherhood of the Glorious Sun''' was a sect of the church of [[Lathander]] that believed he was the reincarnation of the supposedly dead deity [[Amaunator]].",
        "History": "The Brotherhood was a recognized cleric and knightly order within the Church of [[Lathander]]. Generally the members of the brotherhood were led by [[Sunmaster]]s. Around [[1373 DR]], the Brotherhood was under the leadership of [[Daelegoth Orndeir]].",
        "Location": "The Brotherhood was entrusted with the keeping of chapterhouses or shrines dedicated to the sun aspect of [[Lathander]] and thus could be found across Faer没n. The sect was headquartered in the [[Temple of the Morn]] in [[Elversult]].",
        "Dogma": "Through actions, a [[Sunmaster]]'s task was to show how superior the faith of [[Lathander]] was over others. Bold action, and triumphic victories over chaos was what the [[Sunmaster]]s believed would show how their interpretation of the connection between [[Lathander]] and [[Amaunator]] was the correct path. Sunmasters believed the sun was the ultimate symbol of their faith, representing dependibility, lawfulness, knowing what is right and banishing darkness.",
