'''House Aelorothi''' was a [[gold elf]] noble house with holdings on [[Evermeet]] by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were once a minor house of the realm of [[Siluvanede]] (c. {{Yearlink|-8400}} to [[882 DR]]).

==Livery==
The colors of the house were red and blue, while its crest depicted a red [[swan]] on a blue field.

==Home==
By [[1367 DR]], the family home was located in the northern part of the city of [[Leuthilspar]] on Evermeet. It was a tower, tall and slender, pale blue in color with green veins.

==Activities==
Traditionally, the Aelorothi elves served as priests and warrior-clerics to the elven gods of the [[Seldarine]], especially [[Corellon Larethian]]. Their numbers were much diminished by 1367 DR, but they still cared for Evermeet's temples and blessed elf [[fighter]]s and sailors.

Despite this holy calling, the Aelorothi of ancient Siluvanede were among those minor houses corrupted by [[House Dlardrageth]] from around {{Yearlink|-4800}}. They joined in their elf–[[demon]] crossbreeding and spawned a bloodline of [[fey'ri]], and were complicit in the realm's warmongering, before being held captive for millennia. After their liberation in [[1369 DR]], the Aelorothi fey'ri became a subclan of House Dlardrageth and joined the [[daemonfey]] army of [[Sarya Dlardrageth]].

Coincidentally, many of Aelorothi—gold elf or fey'ri—were noted spies.

==Possessions==
The family on Evermeet owned a number of precious magical items suited for [[cleric]]s, such as two ''[[rod of resurrection|rods of resurrection]]'' and the storied ''[[staff of Rumathil]]''.

==Notable Members==
Gold elf members included:
* Mi'tilarro Aelorothi, a High Priest of [[Corellon Larethian]], present during the rise of Zaor Moonflower to be king of Evermeet.
* [[Rennyn Aelorothi]], a spy for Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower|Amlaruil]] in the late 1360s DR.

Fey'ri members included:
* Lord [[Pharnth Aelorothi]], the patriarch of the Aelorothi fey'ri and spy for the daemonfey from [[1369 DR]];
* Lady-Consort [[Saesaan Aelorothi]], his consort;
* [[Jasrya Aelorothi]], a high-ranking [[bladesinger]];
* [[Laelran Aelorothi]], a spy in the [[Arcane Brotherhood]];
* [[Vesryn Aelorothi]], a [[sorcerer]] at the [[daemonfey bolthole]] and later spymaster of the daemonfey.
