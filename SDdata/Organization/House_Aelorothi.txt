House Aelorothi was a gold elf noble house with holdings on Evermeet by the 14 century DR. They were once a minor house of the realm of Siluvanede (c.  to 882 DR).
The colors of the house were red and blue, while its crest depicted a red swan on a blue field.
By 1367 DR, the family home was located in the northern part of the city of Leuthilspar on Evermeet. It was a tower, tall and slender, pale blue in color with green veins.
Traditionally, the Aelorothi elves served as priests and warrior-clerics to the elven gods of the Seldarine, especially Corellon Larethian. Their numbers were much diminished by 1367 DR, but they still cared for Evermeets temples and blessed elf fighters and sailors.
Despite this holy calling, the Aelorothi of ancient Siluvanede were among those minor houses corrupted by House Dlardrageth from around . They joined in their elf–demon crossbreeding and spawned a bloodline of feyri, and were complicit in the realms warmongering, before being held captive for millennia. After their liberation in 1369 DR, the Aelorothi feyri became a subclan of House Dlardrageth and joined the daemonfey army of Sarya Dlardrageth.
Coincidentally, many of Aelorothi—gold elf or feyri—were noted spies.
The family on Evermeet owned a number of precious magical items suited for clerics, such as two rods of resurrection and the storied staff of Rumathil.
