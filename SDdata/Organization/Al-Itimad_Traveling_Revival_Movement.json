        "mainbody": "'''Al-Itimad Traveling Revival Movement''' was a group of wandering [[ethoist]] priests in the coastal towns of [[Zakhara]].",
        "Activities": "This group differed from most ethoists organizations in that they chose to wander around the Land of Fate and spread the word of their god. By far, the vast majority of ethoists favored sedentary existences in their temples and mosques.\n\nAfter decades of spreading their word, their activities ceased after the untimely death of their leader."
