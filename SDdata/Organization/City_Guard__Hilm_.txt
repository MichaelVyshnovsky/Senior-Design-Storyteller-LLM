The '''City Guard''' of [[Hilm]] served as a police force within the city as well as a standing army for the "City of Kindness".

==Organization==
The composition of the city guard as of {{Yearlink|1367}}{{AQ-time}} was 1,000 regular city guards, 120 [[cleric]]s, and three 300-man units of [[mamluk]]s from the [[Exalted Mamluk Society]]. An additional 2,000 soldiers and 1,000 cavalry from the [[Sword of the True Gods]] were also stationed in Hilm. Hilm did not have a standing navy.

==Activities==
The soldiers of the Sword of the True Gods were primarily concerned with protecting the outlaying farmlands as well as any travelers through the area.
