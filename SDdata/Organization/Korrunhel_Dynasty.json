        "mainbody": "The Korrunhel family was a noble house of Tethyr that held the throne under the Shoon Imperium, becoming the third of the Shoon Traitorum dynasties.\nThe Korrunhels became royalty through the actions of their founder, Matamid Korrunhel. Matamid served the previous king, Emyr Cormal, as his vizier and regent due to his young age. King Emyr eventually came of age and ruled for a time, but failed to produce an heir before his early death. The throne ultimately went to Matamid, whose dynasty ruled until the marriage of Queen Vajra with Karazir Tiiraklar, leading to the Tiiraklar Dynasty."
