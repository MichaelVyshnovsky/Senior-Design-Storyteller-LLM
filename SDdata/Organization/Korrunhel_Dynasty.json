Matamid served the previous king, [[Emyr Cormal]], as his vizier and regent due to his young age. King Emyr eventually came of age and ruled for a time, but failed to produce an heir before his early death. The throne ultimately went to Matamid, whose dynasty ruled until the marriage of Queen [[Vajra Korrunhel|Vajra]] with [[Karazir Tiiraklar]], leading to the [[Tiiraklar Dynasty]].",
