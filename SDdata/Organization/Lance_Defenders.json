        "mainbody": "The '''Lance Defenders''' were the core of [[Tymanther]] military forces, a highly trained army of [[dragonborn]] soldiers gathered from every [[Thymari#Clans|clan]], who were specialized in fighting with [[lance]]s and other weapons, both on foot and in aerial combat, mounted on [[giant bat]]s. Their primary task was to defend [[Djerad Thymar]] from [[dragon]] attacks.",
        "Membership": "The Lance Defenders membership primarily consisted of Tymantheran dragonborn, although a few individuals of other races could be allowed to join their ranks if they had the support of the clan elders.\n\nDuring and after the [[first Tymanther-Unther War]], the [[mulan]]i refugees who had joined [[Namshita's clan]] were allowed to join the Lance Defenders.",
        "Organization": "The Lance Defenders' forces were divided into platoons named \"cohorts\". Each cohort was led by a field commander. The field commanders were under the leadership of the lead commander, who was the high ranking officer of the Lance Defenders. who had held the position for more than a decade.\n\nAbove the lead commander was the [[Vanquisher]] itself, who was the supreme general of the Lance Defenders and all other military forces in Tymanther.\n\nAlthough few [[Thymari]] had a knack for [[magic]], the Lance Defenders maintained a number of [[spellcaster]]s among their ranks. \n\nAs of 1487 DR, the following cohorts were known:\n* The Ninth Blue Cohort, composed by warriors specialized in the use of [[polearm]]s.\n* The Sixth Red Cohort, an all-spellcaster squad composed of eighty [[wizard]]s.\n* The Eight Red Cohort, a platoon made out exclusively of mulani warriors.\n* The Seventh Silver Cohort, an elite platoon.",
        "Headquarters": "The headquarters of the Lance Defenders, known as the Lance Barracks, were located in the highest place of the [[City Bastion (Djerad Thymar)|City Bastion]], along with the Lance Roost that served as the giant bat stables. The Barracks were directly connected to the Vanquisher's Enclave. \n\nThe Lance Roost was located in the  open space in the center of the interior of Djerad Thymar, allowing the soldiers mounted in the giant bats to freely maneuver within the city. A giant, rectangular opening was the only exit to the exterior of the city. \n\nThe Barracks location was specifically chosen to facilitate the Lance Defenders' duty to protect the city against aerial attacks.",
        "Activities": "Service in the Lance Defenders was mandatory for all Thymari dragonborn who had reached adulthood for two years, but only a small percentage remained after that period and became permanent soldiers. If a Lance Defender was able to get enough promotions, there was the possibility that he or she was deemed fit to be elected as a Vanquisher.\n\nTheir giant bats were highly prized by the Thymari, and only members of the Lance Defenders or important guests were permitted to use them, though they were exclusively for use of the Lance Defenders in wartime. \n\nA minority of Lance Defenders were selected to become Lance Scouts. As elite members of the military, the Lance Scouts were trained to work as part of small groups or alone and were tasked to travel beyond Tymanther's borders and learn more about [[Faerûn]]. Lance Scouts were also expected to track movements of potentially dangerous dragons around the realms.",
        "History": "Although the Lance Defenders were renowned for their expertise killing dragons, by [[1479 DR]] they were ill-prepared for fighting other threats Faerûn had to offer. For that reason, when [[ash giants]] began to  [[invasion of Tymanther|invade Tymanther]] as part of the [[green dragon]] [[Skuthosiin]]'s plans as a ''taaldarax'' of [[Capnolithyl|Brimstone]]'s ''[[xorvintaal]]'', they suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the [[giant]]s.\n\nTo improve their chances of defeating the invading giants, [[Khouryn Skulldark]] of the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] was hired by Vanquisher [[Kepeshkmolik Tarhun]] to train them in [[dwarf|dwarven]] fighting techniques, as dwarves were renowned giant hunters. The training proved to be effective, and in subsequent operations the Lance Defenders were able to defeat the giants attacking the farms near Djerad Thymar.\n\nAfter a few victories, the Vanquisher led all the dragonborn military forces—Lance Defenders, [[Platinum Cadre]], private [[Thymari#Clans|clans]]' war bands—in a final, desperate battle against the giants on [[Kythorn 9]]. The joined Thymari forces were able to drive the giants off their lands. After the [[wizard]] [[Kanjentellequor Biri|Biri]] uncovered Skuthosiin as the true mastermind of the giants, Vanquisher Tarhun ordered another joint military operation, on [[Flamerule 5]], this time to laid siege to [[Ashhold]] and to kill Skuthosiin.\n\nThe Lance Defenders took heavy casualties during the first Tymanther-Unther War, in the wake of the [[Second Sundering]]. A great number of them went missing during the exchanging of lands between [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]]. Ill-prepared to face the hordes of [[demon]]s in the [[Unther]]an forces, and with the chaos following the magic of the Sundering, the Kethendan forward regiment was utterly destroyed when the Untherans laid siege to [[Djerad Kethendi]].\n\nAs the Untherite forces advanced against Djerad Thymar, [[Yrjixtilex Kallan]] was chosen as the interim Vanquisher on [[Hammer 6]] of [[1487 DR]] in order to assemble all of Tymanther's military forces, and sent an unified front against Unther. On [[Hammer 10]], the forces of Gilgeam laid siege to Djerad Thymar while the [[Chosen]] of the gods [[Asmodeus]] and [[Azuth]] conducted a [[ritual]] on the city in order to make both gods separate entities again. To maintain her position in the [[Nine Hells]], [[Glasya]] sent the Malbolgean forces, led by a [[pit fiend]] named [[Khartach]], to help the Thymari against the demons, helping the Chosen to accomplish their goal, and allowing the Thymari forces to lift the siege of both Djerad Thymar and Djerad Kethendi, ending the war with a decisive victory for Tymanther.",
