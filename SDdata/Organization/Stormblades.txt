}}The '''Stormblades''' were an [[adventuring company]] from the city of [[Tsurlagol]] in [[the Vast]].

==History==
The Stormblades hailed from the city of Tsurlagol, but had come to [[Harrowdale]] in the [[Dalelands]] by [[1370 DR]].

There they were hired by Stablemaster [[Alark Phlamtryn]] of the [[The Redmark|Redmark]] inn to guard the inn's staff against treasure-hunters and thieves who'd harass them.
