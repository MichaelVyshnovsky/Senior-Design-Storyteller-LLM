        "History": {
            "Origins": "Like some adventuring parties, the heroes of Baldur's Gate first came together by pure chance. Some time between the {{YearlinkName|1482}}, and the {{YearlinkName|1488}}, Delina came to the city of Baldur's Gate searching for her estranged brother [[Deniak]]. She arrived on the night of a full moon and was set after by a pair of [[gargoyle]]s who pursued through the [[Upper City]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 1|6}} During the chase, a pair of helpful members of [[the Watch]] fell to the stone beasts.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 1|9}}\n\nEventually Delina stumbled into famous statue known as the [[Beloved Ranger]] in [[the Wide]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 1|11}} When casting at the gargoyles, one of her [[spell]]s backfired, emitting a [[wild surge]] that struck the statue and \"brought back\" the personalities it depicted — Minsc and Boo.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 1|12}} The ranger Minsc mistook Delina for one of his former traveling companions, [[Neera]], with whom he traveled the century prior. The [[Rashemaar berserker]] defeated the two elemental predators and the pair ran off before they could be apprehended by other guards of Watch.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 1|15-21}}\n\nDuring their escape, the Delina and Minsc ran into two thieves, Krydle and Shandie,{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 1|25}} who possessed no ill intent but rather offered their newfound \"friends\" some shelter within their hideout. After some getting to know one another, the thieves agreed to sneak the sorceress, ranger and hamster into the [[Lower City]] to evade the grasp of the Watch.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2|6-9}}",
            "Cult of the Dragon": "The group traveled to the [[Undercellar]] and met with [[Fetcher|The Fetcher]]. Together, the two parties agree that, in exchange for information of Delina's brother and safe passage to the lower city, Minsc, Delina, Krydle and Shandie would deliver the Fetcher's letter a certain member of the [[Parliament of Peers]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2|12-14}}\n\nAfter the meeting, the adventurers were ambushed by agents of the [[Cult of the Dragon]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2|15}} After routing their attackers and regrouping in their headquarters, Krydle set off to deliver the letter. Minsc followed suit after learning that his old friend Coran, who also happened to be Krydle's father, was the recipient.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 2|19-20}} At the revel, Krydle briefly reunited with his father and delivered the Fetcher's letter, before the cultists attacked again. The fight turned into a rooftop chase, and Delina was captured by the dragon cultists.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|7-17}}\n\nAfter a short pursuit the head cultist saw that Delina had been apprehended and immediately killed his subordinates. Taking off his mask, he revealed himself to be Deniak, the brother she had traveled so far to meet again.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|19-21}} Deniak brought her to his lair in [[Brampton]], and began to lay out the dark ritual he had prepared to appeal to the yet-returned goddess of [[dragon]]s, [[Tiamat]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|5-6}}\n\n[[File:Legends of Balders gate 4 - Deniak - p7.png|thumbnail|right|250px|Deniak reveals himself]]\n\nThe heroes interrogated one of the cultists and learned about Deniak and his evil scheme, Krydle, Shandie and Minsc set out for Brampton. Meanwhile, Delina spoke with her brother, learning that he intended to use her [[wild magic]] power in order he could stand toe-to-toe with Tiamat rather than bend to her will. The heroes broke into Deniak's lair and found Delina immobilized, with the dark ritual already underway. While they defeated the [[hobgoblin]] minions, they were unable to stop Deniak in time and he transformed into a [[red dragon]],{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|7-18}}{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|21}} causing a huge explosion in the [[Lower City]].{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|20}}\n\nThe red dragon Deniak clutched Delina in its massive talon and took to the air.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|3-4}} Using their combined efforts, the four companions, and Boo, brought the unnatural beast crashing to the ground before delivering a killing blow.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|6-17}} While the citizens of Baldur's Gate rejoiced, the heroes regrouped and quietly celebrated the victory in their hideout. They decided to continue helping solve problems in the city together as friends.{{Cite comic/Legends of Baldur's Gate 3|19-21}}",
            "Journey to Barovia": "For one of their next jobs, the Heroes of Baldur's Gate were hired by [[Alby|Father Alby]] to watch over and protect the [[Temple of Kelemvor (Baldur's Gate)|temple]] of [[Kelemvor]] in the Lower City. There they met [[Nerys]], the brave and outspoken [[cleric]] who also served the Lord of the Dead.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 1|10-13}} On their first night of duty, the temple was assaulted by a pair of [[werewolves]] and a score of risen [[skeleton]]s.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 1|7}} Unfortunately, the evil shapechangers managed to abduct Nerys, Boo and steal cache of [[relic]]s before fleeing to their lair.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 1|17-21}}\n\nThanks to Boo's efforts, the heroes tracked down the werewolves' hideout and began to rescue their friends. During the fight, a particular locket, which originated from the otherworldly realm of [[Barovia]], created a thick fog that began to fill the air. The fog quickly filled the room and the heroes, the Kelemvorite Nerys, along with the two werewolves and their associate [[Sangin]], were all transported to the [[Demiplane of Dread]].{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 1|19-30}} \n\nAs the Heroes of Baldur's Gate attempted to get their wits about them, they were quickly separated from those they just fought against. An aggressive colony of bats enveloped the ground and whisked Sangin away while the werewolves [[Dron]] and [[Utna]] left them to their fate. The group recovered the locket that transported them from [[Faerûn]] and stumbled across a caravaneer circus. After Minsc has his fortune read by a [[:category:seers|seer]] and the group saved a runaway wagon that was being assaulted by [[ghoul]]s,{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 2|3-20}} they found refuge for the night at a nearby vineyard.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3|2-4}}\n\nDuring the night, Delina and Krydle were each beset by horrific dreams that put them in a trance-like state. Without knowing it, Delina nearly strangled Krydle to death before Shandie woke them out of the stupor.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 3|11-19}} The following day was just as grim. While the group was deeply troubled by what they have experienced they managed to soldier on to the town of Vallaki. They were taken aback by the dour and joyless demeanor of everyone they met.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 4|3}} \n\nAfter the group disrupted a bizarre and troubling \"festival\", they were assaulted by the recently-[[undead|risen]] [[Sangin]], a pack of werewolves and three [[vampire]]s who served the master of Barovia. The heroes fought valiantly and, although Nerys was bitten by one of the lycanthropes, the battle turned in their favor. Just after the Barovian monstrosities turned on one another,{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 4|7-17}} [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] himself appeared,{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 4|20}} to claim the locket that was hidden away on [[Toril]].{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|2}} He briefly toyed with the heroes, before besting them in combat and reclaiming the relic he sought.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|5-14}} \n\nThe otherworldly power within the amulet assaulted Strahd in the form of his brother, distracting him momentarily. Seizing the opportunity Delina grabbed the amulet and focused on escape. Despite the trauma they had collectively endured, the group banded together and a flash of white light engulfed them all.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|15-19}}",
            "Giants of the North": "Although they were not sure how, the burst of energy from the amulet transported the heroes back to Toril, in the [[Spine of the World]] mountains, over a thousand miles away from Baldur's Gate.{{Cite comic/Shadows of the Vampire 5|20-21}}{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 1|9}} As Nerys was gravely injured during their fight with Strahd, Minsc carried her as the group sought shelter from the piercing wind and snow. Finding a nearby cave they regrouped emotionally. While they shared their self-doubt and bleak outlook on their situation, the group did not turn on another when danger approached.{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 1|10-15}} They defeated a band of [[ogre]]s, with help from their new ally [[Saarvin]], and set out for the nearby settlement of [[Fireshear]].{{Cite comic/Frost Giant's Fury 1|19-27}}",
            "The Absolute": "In [[1492 DR]], the group began to investigate the [[Cult of the Absolute]]."
