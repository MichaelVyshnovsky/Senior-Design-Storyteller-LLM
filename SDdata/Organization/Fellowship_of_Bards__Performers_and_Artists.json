Here, musicians, actors, and performers of all kinds live and work, producing fine entertainment and works of art for your enjoyment. Our theater, the Ravens Bluff Playhouse, offers weekly performances by some of the most talented bards of our fair city. Look for the Guild red and blue for a great show!''\"|''Anonymous''}}\nThe '''Fellowship of Bards, Performers and Artists''' was a guild comprising the [[bard]]s, actors, musicians, craftsmen, artists, singers, and other performers that operated within the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Different from a bards' college, the fellowship operated as a true guild, which was uncommon for a [[Faer√ªn]]ian bardic institution.",
        "Activities": {
            "Crafting": "Master Craftsman [[Randall Morann]] had his pupils create beautiful musical instruments, which were available for sale to both guild musicians and citizens of Ravens Bluff.",
            "Performances": "Shows put on by the guild were impressive affairs that transformed their venue into a magical place to be for a night. The theater allowed for a number of experience-enhancing effects, such as a \"birdwire\" that allowed thespians to be lowered onto the stage (as if they were flying) and iron cages, which held monster-shaped sculptures or near-naked performers, that could be suddenly dropped to jolt any bored or tired audience members out of their seats. Makeshift \"lightning\" could be created from lamps encased in metal cylinders, often enhanced with overlays that created shadow effects like spider webs over the stage. Many performances were given an [[arcane]] touch thanks to the [[illusory]] [[magic]] of the brilliant and comical special-effects artist [[Arrion Weatherspoon]]."

            "Ravens Bluff Playhouse|Playhouse": ":Located just next door to the guildhall, the theater of Ravens Bluff put on weekly performances, where the nobles and commoners alike could enjoy a show. all in Ravens Bluff were welcome to enjoy the show."

        "Members": {
            "Officers": "*Guildmaster [[Colin O'Lyre]]: The head of the bards' guild was a skilled musician and master of stringed instruments. He worked tirelessly to raise the influence of the guild, and earn respect among the power groups within the city. He had successfully promoted the band of performers as an organization of societal importance and financial profitability.\n\n*Master Craftsman [[Randall Morann]]: The guilds expert wood-crafter was also a highly skilled instrument-maker. With his assistant [[Jolan]], he oversaw and trained the guild's apprentice craftspeople within their workshop.\n\n*Master Thespian [[Beatrice Weatherspoon]]: Head of the guild's thespians, as well as the theater's primary director, Lady Weatherspoon was a life-long actress within the Bluff's playhouse. If she had her druthers, all of the performances within the theater would be performed exclusively in [[Elven language|elven]].\n\n*[[Brunhilde Erikksonn]]: After retiring from a career as a renowned singer, Brunhilde doubled as the guild's prop and costume-mistress. Her big heart and great spirit made her a mother-figure of sorts to the guild's apprentices and younger performers.\n\n*[[Arrion Weatherspoon]]: Known affectionately as \"Old Horseface\" among the apprentice bards, Arrion had had a storied life as the jester of a Lord's court outside of [[Procampur]], a traveling-[[illusionist]] full of wanderlust and, most recently, the \"special effects\" artist within the Ravenian performers' Guild."
