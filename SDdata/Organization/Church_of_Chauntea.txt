The '''Church of Chauntea''' was the primary religious organization of the followers of the deity [[Chauntea]], the Great Mother. It was present almost everywhere in [[Faer√ªn]], due to its prevalence in agrarian life.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Harvest Gods:The Portal of Plenty}}

{{quote|The Earthmother is everything, and her health is our health. She feeds us, clothes us, waters us, and shelters us. No god is greater than her, though many are noisier. No god is more forgiving, more nurturing, or more essential. Truly, Chauntea is All.|Creed of the Church}}

==Dogma==
{{quote|Growing and reaping are part of the eternal cycle and the most natural part of life...|Dogma of Chauntea}}

===Beliefs===
Faithfuls believed that Chauntea was as old as [[Toril|the world]] itself. They saw her as one that gave life to natural creatures and plants, and that gifted [[humanoid]] races with the secrets of agriculture.

Land owners and farmers hit with unproductive harvests visited her clerics for divine suggestions. If at any time plague or drought struck the crops, farmers looked to the goddess, since they hoped she would save the harvest due to her love of nature.

It was believed that money donated to a temple of the church would return to the giver tenfold.

===Attitudes===
Practitioners of the Chauntean faith cared about the fertility of the earth, the growing and reaping of plants, and the eternal cycle of life. They often shared food with strangers and people in need, freely sharing the bounty of the land.

Considering destruction and leveling without rebuilding as a disgrace, the faithful avoided using [[fire]] and planted a seed of a small plant at least once per [[tenday]]. They made to always till their wastes back into agricultural soil, in order to support new life.

Members of the clergy were quiet and patient, emulating the qualities they saw in their goddess. They were known for their wisdom, and for their willingness to help with agricultural work, taking a hands-on approach especially when farmers were ill of injured. This caused them to receive great respect and admiration from their peers.

While the faith revolved around a doctrine made of values and taboos, there were as many interpretations as there were practitioners. Knowing that their goddess was everywhere and could see everything, the majority of Nurturers led a good and honest life. A few however saw nothing wrong with lying or stealing in order to acquire good land&mdash;they reasoned that treasures don't feed anyone or keep them warm, and that lying was merely countering human foolishness with more of the same.

==Activities==
{{quote|Let no day pass in which you have not helped a living thing flourish...|Dogma of Chauntea}}

===Research===
Priests of the faith had a mission to learn as much as possible about plants,including topics such as horticulture, plant types and diseases, and general folk knowledge regarding flora. Some Nurturers would also study monsters, while others would focus on details of the natural order of things such as erosion, water currents or wind patterns.

===Teaching===
Members of the clergy shared their knowledge with clergymen and laypeople alike. They encouraged civilized folks to enrich the land using methods such as replanting, composting, and irrigation. In addition to planting, priests instructed their flock on the identification of plants, and of disease impacting the flora and fauna.

Due to the clergy's teachings, most common folks felt a closeness to "natural cycles"&mdash;thanks to this, there were no religious nor social stigma regarding women's monthly bleeding.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2006)/Body Hair and Menstrual Cycles}}

===Agriculture===
On their travels members of the church planted trees, removed weeds hampering crops, prepared the land to receive crops, and used spells to drive away predators. They burned diseased plants as well as the corpse of plague-ridden animals in order to prevent contamination, and were always watching such blazes extremely carefully.

Chauntean agriculture included practices such as diverting waterways and draining wetlands to help plant more harvestable crops.

===Defense===
In some places such as [[Felshroun]], members of the clergy would accompany patrols in order to defend the inhabitants against trouble.{{Cite web/The Border Kingdoms/Felshroun}}

===Seed banks===
The faithful of Chauntea were encouraged to donate any extra seed their plants yielded to temples, so the seeds could be redistributed to those in need.

===Raising orphans===
It was usual for orphans to be raised by priests and laypeople in their temples. The clergy of Chauntea was often tasked with such charges, as it was seen as a "neutral" faith by other clergies and could use the extra pair of hands to help with labor-intensive agricultural activities.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2013)/Status of Children}}

==Organization==

[[File:Chauntea and silvanus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''A priestess of Chauntea and a priest of [[Silvanus]].'']]
===Clergy===
People of all races joined the church, and a vast majority of them were females.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2012)/Concerning Witches}}

Due to their affinity with the [[Earth (element)|Earth]] [[domain]], [[Earth genasi]] were common amongst the clergy. They were either clerics or laypeople, and often tasked with guarding duties.

Some [[truenamer]]s joined the clergy as well, interested by the creation and cosmological structure of the Realms.{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Truenamers}}

In the [[Uthgardt]] tribes, a clergy of female [[shaman]]s served Chauntea, which was considered the patron of women.

===Internal allegiances===
While cordial, relations between clerics and druids were sometimes difficult: druids considered themselves the "true clerics of Chauntea", and saw city clerics as upstarts; while clerics viewed druids as a thing of the past, still useful in wild lands but destined to be replaced by a more professional and organized clergy.

Monks always allied themselves to the leader of a [[temple]] or druidic circle, whereas mystics and shamans were fiercely independent, reporting to their goddess directly.

The Chauntean faith was highly individualistic, and as such recognized no central authority. Hierarchy was based on wisdom and length of service, favoring the individuals with a higher understanding of nature and its cycles.

===Titles===
; Titles {{small|(in ascending order of rank)}}
: Close One &bull; Watchful Brother / Sister of the Earth &bull; Trueseed &bull; Harvestmaster / Harvestmistress &bull; High Harvestmaster / High Harvestmistress &bull; Onum 

In addition, rural clerics referred to themselves as "Pastorals", whereas some older sects focused on the wilderness called themselves the "True Shapers".

===Orders===
The clergy of Chauntea was known to have no affiliated military of knightly orders.

* The [[Sisters of the House]]: an all-female order of priestesses who tended to the [[Harvest House (Amn)|Harvest House]] in [[Amn]].

* The [[Bountiful Lady of the Vast Circle]]: a small [[druid]]ic circle active near [[Ravens Bluff]] and [[Dragon Falls (village)|Dragon Falls]].{{Cite polyhedron/119/The Druid Circle of Chauntea}}

==Rituals==
{{quote|See to the fertility of the earth, but let the human womb see to its own...|Dogma of Chauntea}}

===Prayers===
As much as possible, members of the church strived to pray on freshly tilled ground, in a farmland, or in a garden. Wells and watering places were also considered acceptable praying locations.

* Practitioners began their day by whispered thanks to Chauntea for continuously supporting life.
* At the end of the day, Chaunteans prayed to the setting sun. They believed it was the medium used by their goddess to send her powers. It was also at this moment that clerics and druids prayed for spells.
* Prayers were also offered whenever something was planted, or when worshipers were moved by the beauty of surrounding nature.
* When soldiers left for battle, it was common for their beloved to offer prayers to several deities. Amongst those, Chauntea was commonly prayed to wish for auspicious healing and protection against diseases and festering wounds.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2011)/Prayers for a Warrior}}
* In mercantile towns of [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]], merchants would pray to Chauntea in the days preceding the harvests. This was mostly due to the fact that the bulk of their trade depended on agricultural surpluses.

===Ceremonies===
Ceremonies which took place outside were lit by sun or moonlight. Other ceremonies could be held in temples or shrines, in the house of the priests themselves, or even in barns or haylofts. Chaunteans believed that spending their wedding night in a freshly tilled field guaranteed a fertile marriage.

In [[Wa]], Chauntean ceremonies involved small groups of people sitting around trees or bushes for about an hour, and singing softly about the abundance of nature. Such ceremonies were extremely peaceful, and white doves circled above the practitioners.

===Holidays===
* [[Greengrass]] was a hedonistic fertility festival, during which lots of food and drinks were consumed.
* The [[High Prayers of the Harvest]] were solemn celebrations of Chauntea's bounty, held at the time a community harvested its crops. While the date wasn't strictly defined, it usually happened around [[Highharvestide]].

During or around religious holidays, priests of Chauntea would often organize agricultural fairs.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2010)/Meetings, Fairs}}

===Religious Services===
The clergy of Chauntea presided over numerous marriage ceremonies. They also often acted as midwives for humanoids and animals alike.
