The Church of Chauntea was the primary religious organization of the followers of the deity Chauntea, the Great Mother. It was present almost everywhere in Faer√ªn, due to its prevalence in agrarian life.
Faithfuls believed that Chauntea was as old as the world itself. They saw her as one that gave life to natural creatures and plants, and that gifted humanoid races with the secrets of agriculture.
Land owners and farmers hit with unproductive harvests visited her clerics for divine suggestions. If at any time plague or drought struck the crops, farmers looked to the goddess, since they hoped she would save the harvest due to her love of nature.
It was believed that money donated to a temple of the church would return to the giver tenfold.
Practitioners of the Chauntean faith cared about the fertility of the earth, the growing and reaping of plants, and the eternal cycle of life. They often shared food with strangers and people in need, freely sharing the bounty of the land.
Considering destruction and leveling without rebuilding as a disgrace, the faithful avoided using fire and planted a seed of a small plant at least once per tenday. They made to always till their wastes back into agricultural soil, in order to support new life.
Members of the clergy were quiet and patient, emulating the qualities they saw in their goddess. They were known for their wisdom, and for their willingness to help with agricultural work, taking a hands-on approach especially when farmers were ill of injured. This caused them to receive great respect and admiration from their peers.
While the faith revolved around a doctrine made of values and taboos, there were as many interpretations as there were practitioners. Knowing that their goddess was everywhere and could see everything, the majority of Nurturers led a good and honest life. A few however saw nothing wrong with lying or stealing in order to acquire good land&mdashthey reasoned that treasures dont feed anyone or keep them warm, and that lying was merely countering human foolishness with more of the same.
Priests of the faith had a mission to learn as much as possible about plants,including topics such as horticulture, plant types and diseases, and general folk knowledge regarding flora. Some Nurturers would also study monsters, while others would focus on details of the natural order of things such as erosion, water currents or wind patterns.
Members of the clergy shared their knowledge with clergymen and laypeople alike. They encouraged civilized folks to enrich the land using methods such as replanting, composting, and irrigation. In addition to planting, priests instructed their flock on the identification of plants, and of disease impacting the flora and fauna.
Due to the clergys teachings, most common folks felt a closeness to "natural cycles"&mdashthanks to this, there were no religious nor social stigma regarding womens monthly bleeding.
On their travels members of the church planted trees, removed weeds hampering crops, prepared the land to receive crops, and used spells to drive away predators. They burned diseased plants as well as the corpse of plague-ridden animals in order to prevent contamination, and were always watching such blazes extremely carefully.
Chauntean agriculture included practices such as diverting waterways and draining wetlands to help plant more harvestable crops.
In some places such as Felshroun, members of the clergy would accompany patrols in order to defend the inhabitants against trouble.
The faithful of Chauntea were encouraged to donate any extra seed their plants yielded to temples, so the seeds could be redistributed to those in need.
It was usual for orphans to be raised by priests and laypeople in their temples. The clergy of Chauntea was often tasked with such charges, as it was seen as a "neutral" faith by other clergies and could use the extra pair of hands to help with labor-intensive agricultural activities.

While cordial, relations between clerics and druids were sometimes difficult druids considered themselves the "true clerics of Chauntea", and saw city clerics as upstarts while clerics viewed druids as a thing of the past, still useful in wild lands but destined to be replaced by a more professional and organized clergy.
Monks always allied themselves to the leader of a temple or druidic circle, whereas mystics and shamans were fiercely independent, reporting to their goddess directly.
The Chauntean faith was highly individualistic, and as such recognized no central authority. Hierarchy was based on wisdom and length of service, favoring the individuals with a higher understanding of nature and its cycles.
