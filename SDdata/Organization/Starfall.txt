'''Starfall''' was an archaic noble [[elven]] house from the [[Time of Dragons]].

==Territory==
The Starfall territory coincided with the heart of King [[Orchtrien]]'s realm.

==Relationships==
The Starfall were vassals of Orchtrien, but they were not very loyal to him.

==History==
In {{yearlink|-25090}}, the house of Starfall set an ambush together with the [[Vilirith]] and [[Duskmere]] against some of Orchtrien's forces in a forest within the heart of his own kingdom. They nearly defeated the arriving force, captained by [[Rhespen Ash]], an [[elven]] [[wizard]]; however, Prince [[Bexendral]] teleported into the battle and struck the traitors down before Rhespen's surrender.

After the rebellion was quashed, the heirs of the House were then taken to [[Dawnfire]] to learn and to serve as hostages, which would ensure the House remained on good behavior.
