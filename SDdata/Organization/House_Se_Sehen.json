        "mainbody": "ouse SeSehen was a tribe of snake-headed yuan-ti known for their ability to spit venom. Members of this tribe were called SeSehren.\nHouse SeSehen was the largest and most powerful house within the Black Jungles as of 1372 DR, having seized the former lands of House Hsstafi when they disappeared in the . This also included both the Pit of Vipers and Ssintheessaree.\nThe SeSehen aided Sseth during the deitys initial rise to power when establishing the empire of Serpentes and were awarded the lands of the Tashalar basin for their efforts. The SeSehen counted the members of Houses Extaminos and Sauringar as close allies.\nMembers of this tribe were frequently at odds with the Coiled Cabal as both groups thought they were the rightful crafters of yuan-ti dominance in Faerûn.\nThe SeSehen clashed often with House Eselemas and House Jennestas, given their land claims within the Black Jungle.\nThe SeSehen experimented extensively on creatures found within the Black Jungle. They created the ti-khana, which served their tribe loyally.\nThe SeSehen were forced to withdraw from Tashalar in the  just ten years after Sseths disappearance. This ushered in centuries of somnolence for the tribe. Sseths reappearance during the Time of Troubles in 1358 DR reinvigorated the tribe, prompting them to forge an alliance with the Rundeen slave and trade consortium of Tashalar. The SeSehen exchanged exotic poisons and spices for slaves and transportation of their agents to the ports of the north, scattering their eyes across Faerûn. Among these spies were members of House Extaminos.\nHouse Extaminos split from House SeSehen occurred when a pair of strong claimants for leadership of House SeSehen rose to power. Instead of crippling the house with pointless civil war, the two decided to split and allow any SeSehen to choose which side they would follow. The claimants group with the greater numbers would remain as House SeSehen, while the other would form a new house and lead his followers to a new location."
