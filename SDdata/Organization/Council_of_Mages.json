        "History": "The first \"council\" formed some time around the {{YearlinkName|70}}, during the reign of [[Rhiiman Obarskyr the Glorious|Rhiiman the Glorious]], a matter of decades after the Forest Kingdom was founded. [[Baerauble Etharr]] arose as the kingdom's first [[Royal Magician]] and assembled all the local [[wizard]]s to deal with the threat of monsters that appeared from within the [[King's Forest]]. This group came to be known as the War Wizards.{{Cite dragon/307/Heroes of Cormyr: Adventuring in the Forest Kingdom|49}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1284}}, when [[Rhigaerd II]] was prevented from ascending the throne by [[Salember]], the War Wizards were divided in their loyalties. Two years later, the Royal Magician [[Jorunhast]] made the executive decision to kill Salember. As a result he was exiled for murdering a member of the royal family. The position of Royal Magician was disbanded, and the War Wizards were left without a single polarizing individual to serve as their leader. After this tragedy the group of spellcasters lost a great amount of their power and prestige.\n\nRhigaerd eventually reversed his decision in the {{YearlinkName|1306}}, when he appointed [[Vangerdahast]] as the new Royal Magician. In an attempt to prevent such a disaster happening to the group again, Vangerdahast took several elite War Wizards and magic item crafters renowned for their loyalty to Cormyr and created a separate group he called the Council of Mages.",
        "Leadership": "The [[Court Wizard]] headed the Council. Generally, the Court Wizard also held the position of [[Royal Magician]].{{Cite dragon/407/Crowns and Mantles: The Ranks and Titles of Cormyr|25}}\n\nAs the one who reorganised and split the War Wizards to create the Council, Vangerdahast was its first leader. The next Royal Magician, [[Caladnei]], would follow suit. As she rarely attended its meetings, it often fell to [[Laspeera Inthr√©]] to chair them. \n\nOn Caladnei's death in {{YearlinkName|1399}}, Laspeera temporarily assumed the role of Court Wizard, while tutoring the young [[Ganrahast Aeiulvana]] in his new position as the Royal Magician.{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom|17}}",
        "Membership": "To join the Council, an individual had to receive an invitation. They also had to swear a blood oath to do no harm to Cormyr or its crown, in that order.."
