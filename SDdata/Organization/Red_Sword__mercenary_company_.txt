The '''Red Sword''' was a mercenary company of 2,000 members that was active in [[northeast Faer√ªn]] sometime before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
The company was known to work for the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]], although it was speculated that the Red Wizards hired them solely because "Red" was also in the company's name.

==History==
When the [[Simbul]] learned of the Red Sword's connection to her enemies, the Red Wizards, she and her entourage intercepted them at [[Mistbridge]] under a flag of truce in hopes of convincing them not to attack her land of [[Aglarond]]. The mercenaries instead insulted the Simbul repeatedly, and ultimately fired a volley of [[arrow]]s at her and her allies. Losing her temper, the Simbul [[fly|flew]] into the air wreathed in flames and&mdash;without any assistance
