        "mainbody": "Dheolur was a noble house of Cormyr that was extinct by the late 14 century DR, thanks to its repeated treachery.\nThe noble house had its seat in the town of Dhedluk, which was formerly named Dheolur after the family.\nOne of its houses was situated beyond the Royal Gardens in Suzail, Cormyr, and another in the Kings Forest, protected by a 20-foot-high (6.1 meter) wall, built on top of the ruins of a temple of Moander.\nThe house was elevated to nobility by the grandfather of King Duar Obarskyr. When Magrath the Minotaur seized control of Suzail around 429 DR, the house swore fealty to him almost immediately.\n* Pella Dheolur, sister to Lord Dheolur"
