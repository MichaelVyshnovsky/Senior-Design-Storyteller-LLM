This allowed it to rise to the position of seventh house of Menzoberranzan.\n\nIn [[1359 DR]], House Mizzrym moved up to sixth house when [[House Oblodra]] was destroyed during the [[Time of Troubles]] by [[House Baenre]].\n\nDuring the [[Silence of Lolth]] ([[1372 DR]]â€“[[1373 DR]]), House Mizzrym climbed the ranks once again to fifth house thanks to the treachery and fall of [[House Agrach Dyrr]]. \n\nIn [[1484 DR]], House Mizzrym ascended to the fourth house after the departure of [[House Xorlarrin]] for [[Q'Xorlarrin]], replacing [[House Faen Tlabbar]].",
