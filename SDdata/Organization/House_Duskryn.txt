House Duskryn was a drow house of Menzoberranzan. They won the charter from House Baenre that allowed them to loot the city of Blingdenstone.
The nobles of the house were known for their cruelty which they enacted seemingly for their own perverse amusement. Duskryn consistently trained some of the best armies in Menzoberranzan for the 3,000 years since the houses founding. Advancement was awarded for performance, not noble stature as was the norm in most other houses. However, all of the most famous military victories of the house were defensive rather than offensive in nature.
In the 7 century DR, House Duskryn came under repeated attacks from several other noble houses that were all successfully repelled. Rumors persisted that all of these attacks were planned by Matron Yvonnel Baenre.
In 1484 DR, House Duskryn was the ninth house and set to become the eighth house (and thus part of the Ruling Council) after the departure of House Xorlarrin to QXorlarrin. However, Quenthel Baenre restored House DoUrden and granted it the eighth place instead.
House Duskryn did not fear any lesser house, as their large and well-trained army made them an infeasible target. However, Matron Mother Bernith had ambitions to attack both House TuinTarl and House Fey-Branche.
