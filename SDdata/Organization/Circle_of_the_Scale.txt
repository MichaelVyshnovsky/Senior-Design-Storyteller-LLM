The '''Circle of the Scale''' was a [[druid circle]] active in the vicinity of the [[Dragonspine Mountains]]. This circle went extinct by the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], its only remaining members transformed into [[undead]] monsters.{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|5,16}}

==Activities==
Led by [[Skovac]], a druid who styled himself as Scalebinder, the [[dragon]]-worshiping druids of the Circle of the Scale aimed to lure and enslave dragons. Relying on their magic and on [[kobold]] workers, they excavated a huge [[temple]] below Dragonspine Mountains to use as their base. They intended to use the magic of [[Tiamat's scale]], a powerful magical relic, to control the mind of dragons.

==Possessions==
Druids of the circle wore robes finely embroidered with each of the five colors of the [[chromatic dragon]]s.{{Cite adventurers league/The Courting of Fire|13}}

==History==
Having heard of the circle's plans, the [[red dragon]] [[Scorlworyx]] attacked it alongside an army of [[orc]]s and kobolds and killed most of its members. Having survived the onslaught, Skovac sealed himself inside the [[Temple of the Scale]] with the relic of [[Tiamat]]. In time, he became a wight and continued to watch over his prized possession.
