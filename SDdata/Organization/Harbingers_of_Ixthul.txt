==History==
The Harbingers of Ixthul originally began as a paladin order of [[Moradin]], led by a powerful paladin by the name of [[Ixthul|Deymoden]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Unbidden|5}} Much of what occured between that time and the order's shift into a cult was lost to time, as few of their writings or records survived, but at some point a major change occured. Deymoden changed their name to Ixthul and began striving to become a deity of [[demigod]] or [[exarch]] status.

The other paladins, dedicated to Ixthul's cause, followed their lead in creating a divine [[artifact]] of war{{Cite organized play/LFR/Unbidden|20}} Before the Harbingers of Ixthul had a chance to use their divine artifact of war, they were struck by internal betrayal and quickly fell apart.
