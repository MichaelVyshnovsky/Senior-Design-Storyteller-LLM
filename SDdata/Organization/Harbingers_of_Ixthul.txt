The Harbingers of Ixthul, formerly known by another name lost to time, was a paladin order turned cult in south Faerûn some centuries prior to the 15 century DR.
This order of holy warriors considered it their duty to fight against evil deities and their followers.
The base of this organization was a temple in south Faerûns Underdark, in the vicinity of Eartheart.
The members of this organization rode around upon griffon mounts and had the head of a griffon as the symbol of their organization.
One of the primary enemies of this group were the Church of Bane.
The Harbingers of Ixthul originally began as a paladin order of Moradin, led by a powerful paladin by the name of Deymoden. Much of what occured between that time and the orders shift into a cult was lost to time, as few of their writings or records survived, but at some point a major change occured. Deymoden changed their name to Ixthul and began striving to become a deity of demigod or exarch status.
The other paladins, dedicated to Ixthuls cause, followed their lead in creating a divine artifact of war Before the Harbingers of Ixthul had a chance to use their divine artifact of war, they were struck by internal betrayal and quickly fell apart.
