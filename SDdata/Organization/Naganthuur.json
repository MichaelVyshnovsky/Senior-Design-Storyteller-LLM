        "mainbody": "The '''Naganthuur''' clan was one of the twenty dynastic families that had a seat on the [[Onsruur]] (the council of lords) in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|87}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 66: Khôltar, Part 17, More on the Onsruur}}",
        "Organization": "Members of the Naganthuur bloodline were tall but unattractive in appearance and repressive in nature. This family had a trace of non-[[human]] blood in their veins which gave many of them the ability to shapeshift one or two of their limbs but with varying degrees of control. They were very sensitive about being seen as monsters, so they maintained a reclusive lifestyle and bade their bodyguards to vigorously keep others well away from their person in order to minimize the chance of being startled or threatened into displaying their \"beast-blood\" abilities.",
        "Activities": "The Naganthuur were investors in many businesses across the Iron City, but usually for the short term and with harsh penalty fees for any breach of contract or late payment. They also bought, sold, and collected sculptures of any type, being especially interested in those with hidden storage compartments."
