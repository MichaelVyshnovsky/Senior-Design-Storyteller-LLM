The '''Daggerford militia''', also referred to as the '''army of Daggerford''', was a standing army kept by the [[Daggerford|fortified town]] that comprised citizens from all walks of life.

==Organization==
During the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the militia fell under the command of of the stoic [[Sherlen Spearslayer]].

==Activities==
Despite the requirements for all citizens to serve, active deployments in the militia were rather sparse. They served as guards for a minimum of three days of each month.

Soldiers were required to carry out guard duty or patrol the lands beyond the town's walls.

The constable of Daggerford was selected from among the ranks of the militia.

==Possessions==
Members of the militia were issued a suit of [[studded leather]] [[armor]] and given a [[spear]].{{Cite web/Siege of Dragonspear: Field Report|10}}

===Training===
Each recruit was trained in horsemanship and taught how to wield a spear in combat. While only one day of training was required each month, some militiamen attended more often in order to further hone their skills. 

The duke's master–at–arms offered additional martial training to those who had access to other [[weapons]], or individuals of noble birth.

==Base of Operations==
The militia was headquartered in the town's barracks and were given space to train in the nearby drill field, just south of the town's [[Caravan Quarter]].

==Relationships==
In the years following the [[Second Dragonspear War]], the militia fought alongside the 3{{rd}} company of [[Waterdeep|Waterdeep's]] [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|High Guard]].

==History==
When the [[fiend]]ish [[Hordes of Dragonspear (army)|hordes of Dragonspear]] threatened the [[Sword Coast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1363}}, the militia fought alongside their allies from [[Waterdeep]], along with [[dwarven]] and [[elven]] allies. They valiantly defended their home during the [[Battle of Daggerford]].

After the second [[Dragonspear War]], the [[Council of Guilds]] created a barracks that housed both the town's militia and the 3{{rd}} company of Waterdeep's [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|High Guard]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the Daggerford militia committed all 50 of its soldiers to the [[Coalition]] army that set out to stop the threat of the [[Shining Crusade]]. They fought under the leadership of [[Haither Stonehand|General Haither Stonehand]].{{Cite web/Siege of Dragonspear: Field Report|9}}

Sometime around the {{YearlinkName|1485}} the retired [[Purple Dragon knight]] [[Isteval|Sir Isteval]] let a group of militiamen to [[Cromm's Hold]] after the keep was assaulted by the [[black dragon]] [[Sjachmalsvir]].

A short time later the region around Daggerford was assailed by monstrous creatures, including [[gnoll]]s and [[goblin]]s. Under order of [[Maldwyn Daggerford|Duke Maldwyn]], the militia was forced to close the town's gates and bar entry to the scores of refugees that fled the surrounding farmlands.

==Members==
Every able-bodied resident of Daggerford was required to serve within the militia for 20 years of their life. Those who were deemed too young, too old, or women who were either pregnant or raising young children, were exempt.

The age range that determined whether someone was fit for duty varied depending on race. Those required to serve were:
* [[Humans]], between 15 to 35 years old
* [[Halflings]], between 22 to 60 years old
* [[Dwarves]], between 35 to 120 years old
* [[Gnome]]s, between 50 to 250 years old
* [[Elves]], between 150 to 500 years old

To avoid service, it was possible for someone to pay for another individual in their stead. This payment came to the full cost of that soldiers expenses while in service.

===Notable Members===

* [[Aswansea]], a [[paladin]] who served the deity [[Tyr]]
* [[Frederick]], the loyalist guard captain leader of Daggerford's militia ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].
* [[Llewellyn Longhand|Sir Llewellyn Longhand]], the duke's master–at–arms
* [[Maelwyn]], a former adventurer that preferred a more reserved life
* [[Delfen Ondabarl]], a skilled [[mage]] who taught several apprentices the ways of [[the Art]]
