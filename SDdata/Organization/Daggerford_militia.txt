The Daggerford militia, also referred to as the army of Daggerford, was a standing army kept by the fortified town that comprised citizens from all walks of life.
During the late 14 century DR, the militia fell under the command of of the stoic Sherlen Spearslayer.
Despite the requirements for all citizens to serve, active deployments in the militia were rather sparse. They served as guards for a minimum of three days of each month.
Soldiers were required to carry out guard duty or patrol the lands beyond the towns walls.
The constable of Daggerford was selected from among the ranks of the militia.
Members of the militia were issued a suit of studded leather armor and given a spear.
Each recruit was trained in horsemanship and taught how to wield a spear in combat. While only one day of training was required each month, some militiamen attended more often in order to further hone their skills. 
The dukes master–at–arms offered additional martial training to those who had access to other weapons, or individuals of noble birth.
The militia was headquartered in the towns barracks and were given space to train in the nearby drill field, just south of the towns Caravan Quarter.
In the years following the Second Dragonspear War, the militia fought alongside the 3 company of Waterdeeps High Guard.
When the fiendish hordes of Dragonspear threatened the Sword Coast in the , the militia fought alongside their allies from Waterdeep, along with dwarven and elven allies. They valiantly defended their home during the Battle of Daggerford.
After the second Dragonspear War, the Council of Guilds created a barracks that housed both the towns militia and the 3 company of Waterdeeps High Guard.
In the , the Daggerford militia committed all 50 of its soldiers to the Coalition army that set out to stop the threat of the Shining Crusade. They fought under the leadership of General Haither Stonehand.
Sometime around the  the retired Purple Dragon knight Sir Isteval let a group of militiamen to Cromms Hold after the keep was assaulted by the black dragon Sjachmalsvir.
A short time later the region around Daggerford was assailed by monstrous creatures, including gnolls and goblins. Under order of Duke Maldwyn, the militia was forced to close the towns gates and bar entry to the scores of refugees that fled the surrounding farmlands.
Every able-bodied resident of Daggerford was required to serve within the militia for 20 years of their life. Those who were deemed too young, too old, or women who were either pregnant or raising young children, were exempt.
The age range that determined whether someone was fit for duty varied depending on race. Those required to serve were
* Humans, between 15 to 35 years old
* Halflings, between 22 to 60 years old
* Dwarves, between 35 to 120 years old
* Gnomes, between 50 to 250 years old
* Elves, between 150 to 500 years old
To avoid service, it was possible for someone to pay for another individual in their stead. This payment came to the full cost of that soldiers expenses while in service.
