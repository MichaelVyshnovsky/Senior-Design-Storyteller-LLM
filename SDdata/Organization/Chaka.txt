A chaka was the term given to the core social unit of the Shining Lands.
A basic chaka consisted of a single extended family. However, a large chaka could consist of dozens of families, including unrelated families who were allied together because of similar business interests.
Chakas were usually led by the eldest family member, be they male or female. Many times the eldest, and best, trader would be away on business, at which point a younger member of the chaka would assume leadership until their return.
Chakas were named in a manner similar to a clan. Some prominent chakas are listed below
* Chaka Jeradea
* Seltarir chaka
* Gemstone chaka
* Chaka Firmstand
* Chaka Turamir
