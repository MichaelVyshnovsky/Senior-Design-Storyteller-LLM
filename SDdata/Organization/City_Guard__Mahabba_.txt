The '''City Guard''' of [[Mahabba]] served as a police force within the city as well as a standing army for the "City of Charity".

==Organization==
The composition of the city guard as of {{Yearlink|1367}}{{AQ-time}} was 2,000 regular city guards and 50 [[cleric]]s. An additional 4,000 soldiers and 1,000 cavalry from the [[Sword of the True Gods]] were also stationed in Mahabba. The city did not have a formal navy.

==Activities==
Mahabba used to send wide-ranging patrols as far away as the [[Grey Jungle]], but these forces were kept close to the city given the recent uprising of [[Bala|Balanite]] heretics.
