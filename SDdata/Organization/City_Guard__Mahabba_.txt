The City Guard of Mahabba served as a police force within the city as well as a standing army for the "City of Charity".
The composition of the city guard as of  was 2,000 regular city guards and 50 clerics. An additional 4,000 soldiers and 1,000 cavalry from the Sword of the True Gods were also stationed in Mahabba. The city did not have a formal navy.
Mahabba used to send wide-ranging patrols as far away as the Grey Jungle, but these forces were kept close to the city given the recent uprising of Balanite heretics.
