        "mainbody": "he Urshani were an unusually feral tribe of hobgoblins living in the High Moor in the late 15 century DR. Their feral nature and bestial ways were a result of their close connection to the worgs of Mishkas Warren.\nThe Urshani were known by their especially savage appearance, namely by wearing wolf furs and carrying shields painted with worg heads, as well as having other wolf parts and symbols on them.\nBy 1479 DR, the Urshani had domesticated a pack of worgs. The clan was located in an old ruin in the northwestern portion of the High Moor called Mishkas Warren. Seeking prey, The Urshani and their worgs ventured out of the moor and over the Delimbiyr River. Secomber was a frequent target of raids.\nIn the years after the War of the Silver Marches, the Ushani menaced the town of Secomber. Several times a year, the hobgoblins demanded tribute, and people surrendered food, homemade ale, and ore to stay free. However, the worgs and hobgoblins still attacked on occasion."
