        "mainbody": "The '''Torchriders''' were an independent militia in the lands of southeastern [[Amn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "The Torchriders operated in the lands between the [[South Road (Amn)|South Road]] of Amn and the [[Tethir Road]], handling the countryside below the [[Tejarn Hills]] near [[Riatavin]] and [[Trailstone]].\n\nThey were a loosely organized militia of mounted [[fighter]]s that spread warning of attacks by raiders including [[goblin]]s, [[hobgoblin]]s, [[orc]]s, [[gnoll]]s, and [[human]] deserters from the nearby [[Hillforts]], and gathered up war-parties to respond to them in force.",
        "History": "The lack of a road between [[Hillfort Keshla]] and [[Riatavin]] meant a lack of overland trade, and the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] determined that the area was unworthy of [[Council Army]] patrols. This lack of protection meant that bandits and warbands of [[humanoid]]s were common, and the local farmers were forced to fend for themselves. Their response was the Torchriders, who allowed them to protect the region independent of the Council Army."
