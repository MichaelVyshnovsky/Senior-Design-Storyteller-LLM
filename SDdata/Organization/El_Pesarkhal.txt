The Pesarkhals were the post powerful crime family in Calimshan in 1370 DR, controlling each of the remaining three houses, because Syl-Pasha Ralan el Pesarkhal sat on the throne.
Ralan el Pesarkhal also intentionally married off his daughters to the other families to control them, and while the seat of control for el Pesarkhal was technically in Calimport, there was at least one Pesarkhal family member in a position of power in every city throughout Calimshan.
