The '''Pesarkhals''' were the post powerful crime family in [[Calimshan]] in [[1370 DR]], controlling each of the remaining three houses, because [[Syl-pasha|Syl-Pasha]] [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]] sat on the throne.<ref name=EotSS-p72>

Ralan el Pesarkhal also intentionally married off his daughters to the other families to control them, and while the seat of control for el Pesarkhal was technically in [[Calimport]], there was at least one Pesarkhal family member in a position of power in every city throughout Calimshan.<ref name=EotSS-p72 />
