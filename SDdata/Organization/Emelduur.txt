==Organization==
The Emelduur bloodline favored short, supple bodies and handsome features. They were a talkative bunch with seemingly boundless energy. The children were raised on schemes and intrigue until it was second nature to them.

==Tactics==
The Emelduur clan made their fortune by pushing quick deals, being first into a market, and manipulating commodities and other players to their advantage. Given the choice, they preferred the excitement of speedy transactions in a changing environment over forming a long-term plan and seeing it through.
