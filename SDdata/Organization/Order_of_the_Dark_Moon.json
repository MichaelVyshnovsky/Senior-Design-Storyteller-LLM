        "mainbody": "The '''Order of the Dark Moon''' was a secretive [[monastic order|order of monks]] who dedicated their lives to the deity [[Shar]]. They were considered an elite sect of the [[Sharran]] faith, fanatic devotees who managed to keep hidden their identities, and nearly entirely obscure their exploits from the people of [[Faerûn]].\n\n{{Quote|Today you enter her umbra, baring not just your body and mind but also your souls to the Mistress of the Night.

        "Organization": {
            "Hierarchy": "Monks of the order followed a militaristic hierarchy, one in which the failure to follow orders was punishable by death. Each monk was granted only the knowledge they needed in order to carry out Shar's plots, similar to the manner the Dark Deity treated her clergy.\n\nMost monks referred to each other as \"Dark Brother\" or \"Dark Sister\", while senior instructors were known as \"Dark Fathers\" or \"Dark Mothers\". The most senior monk of each monastery was referred to either as \"Dark Father Abbot\" or \"Dark Mother Abbess\". These leaders received their divine instructions directly from Shar her self."

        "Activities": {
            "Beliefs": "Monks of the Dark Moon were single-minded in their purpose of executing Shar's will across the Realms. They devoted their entire existence to reflect her religious dogma in every aspects of their lives.\n\nThey sought what they referred to as \"knowledge and conversation\" with shadows. They believed that personal loss and the darkening of ones soul was the only means to find true insight into the spiritual self."
        },
        "Membership": "Each monastery of the Dark Moon would take on a new cohort of young adults every 14 months. Shar commanded that the order should never recruit children, or from among the ranks of her church, as the Order must act without interference. Lastly, each prospective Dark Moon acolyte had to demonstrate some sort of [[sorcerer|sorcerous]] power. Any recruit caught lying about any their age, abilities or affiliation were put to the knife.\n\nAcolytes that were eligible were culled from the most indoctrinated of Shar's faithful who had shown zealous devotion. In addition to the intense, year-long-plus training of mind, body and soul, neophytes of the Dark Moon Order were required to perform vile acts upon the groups enemies. Anyone that failed the training, or who could not command sorcerous magic were eliminated, some killed personally by Alorgoth himself.\n\nNovitiates were tasked with performing their first mission for the order, typically one that involved spying upon, infiltrating, or otherwise undermining Shar's enemies. Upon successful completing, they were granted full membership as monks of the Dark Moon.",
        "Abilities": "{{quote|''He's fragile now, and elderly to boot. If you question him in some crude fashion, his heart is likely to stop. But a child of the Dark Moon understands the human body as a healer understands it. It's part of our secret lore. I can cause a prisoner excruciating pain without doing serious harm.''|[[Sefris Uuthrakt]]}}<br/>\nMonks of the Dark Moon were practitioners of the [[Way of Shadow]] monastic tradition,\n\nThey often took on specialized roles for their missions, becoming masters of guerilla tactics, skilled arsonists, lethal dispensers of [[poison]], or expert mounted combatants. Each monk had a specific role to play in each mission; the preparation for which was repeatedly practice until perfection was all but ensured.\n\nAll monks of the order were capable of tapping into the [[Shadow Weave]], and gained access to dark spells like ''[[Lesser shadow tentacle|lesser]]'' and ''[[greater shadow tentacle]]''.",

        "Relationships": "The leader of each Dark Moon monastery met together once per year at the [[Temple of Old Night]], in conference with leaders of the Sharran church.",
        "History": {
            "Twofold Truth": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, Alorgoth took on the guise of 'Collus Darathon', founder of a new spiritual order that sought to bind together two conflicting religions. Taking advantage of the emergent [[Dark Moon heresy]]―the belief that Shar and Selûne were two aspects of the same goddess―Alorgoth founded the [[Cult of the Twofold Truth]], operating out of a [[Temple of the Twofold Goddess|temple]] in the southern Cloud Peaks. The cult rapidly grew more popular among the faithful of Shar and Selûne, but in fact entirely fraudulent. Alorgoth used newfound movement to weed out weak-willed Sharrans, and gather [[Selûnite]] faithful in an enclosed location for easy slaughter.\n\nAlorgoth, nearly managed to kill several prominent worshipers of Selûne at the Twofold temple, save for the efforts of [[Rasaad yn Bashir]]. Rasaad revealed the secrets of the Twofold Truth, and with the help of his allies, turned away the Sharran assassins Alorgoth summoned to the temple. Alorgoth himself barely managed to escape from the battle.",
            "Opening the Shadowfell": "After Alorgoth was exposed as the leader of the Twofold Truth, the Sharran monk led a group of the Dark Moon south to [[Tethyr]]. The order rallied scores of Sharran warriors, and enslaved the [[dwarves]] of [[Clan Deepstone]], forcing them to mine [[shadow gem]]s beneath their [[Deepstone clanhold|clanhold]] in the [[Marching Mountains]]. Alorgoth used the [[shadow gem]]s to power an artifact known as the ''[[Wheel of Obliteration]]'' to create a permanent ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Shadowfell]], and let loose hordes of shadow creatures unto the Realms.\n\nOnce again, Alorgoth was relentlessly pursued by Rasaad yn Bashir and his allies, seeking revenge for the corruption and death of his brother Gamaz. Alorgoth and his [[shadow dragon]] ally [[Yxttrazzal]] lured Rasaad into the [[Shadowfell]] and attempted to trap him away from [[Toril]] and the [[Prime Material plane]]. As the caverns in the Shadowfell began to collapse, Rasaad used the ''Wheel'' to return to the Deepstone caverns, trapping Alorgoth within. His soul became forfeit to the shadow creatures he promised a world of light to devour.",
            "Legacy": "Alorgoth survived his time in the Shadowfell and continued his service to Shar as her \"Bringer of Doom\". The Order of the Dark Moon continued their traditions for over a century, into the era of the [[Second Sundering]]."

        "Notable Members": "[[File:Dark moon Monk.png|thumb|right|150px|''Tharag, a devoted monk of the Dark Moon''.]]\n* [[Alorgoth]], the founder of the monastic order and favored devotee of Shar.\n* [[Alon]], the [[earth genasi]] monk that served as the bodyguard to [[Daren Timbide]].\n* [[Gamaz]], leader of the Dark Moon monastery in Amn.\n* [[Tharag]], the Devoted."
