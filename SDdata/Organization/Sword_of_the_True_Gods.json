        "mainbody": "he Sword of the True Gods was the standing army of the Pantheist League in interior Zakhara.\nThe best soldiers of every Pantheist city were recruited to serve in the Sword. Soldiers from the Sword were stationed near a Pantheist citys main mosque, but individual soldiers were never stationed within their home city. This practice helped enforce the notion that all Pantheist cities worked together as one, and that soldiers would be treated as honored guests wherever they were stationed. Aside from their home city, the soldiers also rotated their posts to each city of the Pantheist League.\nThe strength of the Sword within each major city of the Pantheist League as of 1367 DR is listed below\n* Fahhas 2,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. \n* Hilm 2,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry.\n* Hudid 1,000 infantry and 500 cavalry.\n* Itiraf 8,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry.\n* Mahabba 4,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry.\n* Talab 3,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry."
