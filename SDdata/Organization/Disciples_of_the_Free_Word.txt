The Disciples of the Free Word, who were often mockingly called called the Pens of the Poor, was a monastic order devoted to Deneir, the Lord of All Glyphs.
The Disciples of the Free Word served the Chuch of Deneir by providing scribe services to destitute individuals who could not otherwise afford such services.
