        "mainbody": "The '''Black Horn Regiment''' was a [[yugoloth]] [[mercenary]] company led by the [[ultroloth]] [[Inthracis]]. They were based in [[Corpsehaven]] within the [[Blood Rift]].",
        "Description": "The company was composed by 500 members of various kinds of yugoloth.",
        "History": "In [[1373 DR]], Inthracis was approached by the [[god]] [[Vhaeraun]], who demanded that Inthracis kill the three priestesses who were candidates to become the ''[[Yor'thae]]'' (Chosen of Lolth): [[Quenthel Baenre]], [[Danifae Yauntyrr]], and [[Halisstra Melarn]]. As a reward, Vhaeraun promised Inthracis a higher position. Inthracis led his company to the [[Pass of the Soulreaver]] near the [[Demonweb Pits]] and there battled Quenthel, Danifae, Halisstra, [[Jeggred Baenre]], and [[Pharaun Mizzrym]]. They defeated the regiment, however, and Inthracis was killed by Pharaun. His death was not permanent, however, as he had another clone body to revive in."
