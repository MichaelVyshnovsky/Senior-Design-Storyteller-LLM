The Fray were thirteen mages who helped the Fourteenth Skull maintain the weakened mythal around Skullport known as the Mantle in the 15th century DR.  Members of the Fray were given great power by the Fourteenth Skull but it drove them mad.  They were promised that once the mythal was restored to its former power they would become the new Skulls of Skullport.
Most of the Frays duties were rather mundane such as tracking down and stealing minor magic items which they used to strengthen the mythal.  Occasionally, the Fourteenth Skull required the Fray to capture visiting mages and kill them to add their essence to the mythal.
