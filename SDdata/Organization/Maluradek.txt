Maluradek was one of the noble houses of ancient Anauria.
It was one of three human houses that composed Anaurias nobility, along with House Nemrin and the royal House Thardresk.
Circa the Era of Upheaval, some traces of House Maluradek could be found amongst the ruins of Anauria, scattered across the Anauroch desert.
