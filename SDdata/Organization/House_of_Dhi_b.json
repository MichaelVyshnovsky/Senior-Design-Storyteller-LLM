        "mainbody": "The House of Dhib, also called the Sons of the Wolf, was a large desert tribe of enlightened Al-Badia found in the High Desert of west Zakhara around 1367 DR.\nFour thousand Zakharans formed the House of Dhib. Many of these men and women were craftsmen and herders, but plenty of strong warriors were also among their ranks. Several clans from the tribe, numbering around 200 members each, raided caravans traveling through the south and south-central regions of the desert.\nWarriors of the House of Dhib rode with Kori al-Zafiri against the sultan of Tajar and deposed him.\nOver the years, the House of Dhib had allied itself with or against most of the major tribes of the High Desert depending on their current circumstances. In 1367 DR, an alliance was offered to members of House Bakr who still lived within the High Desert.\nSheikh Anwat al-Makkar ruled the House of Dhib in 1367 DR."
