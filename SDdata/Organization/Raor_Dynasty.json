        "mainbody": "The '''Raor Dynasty''' was the first of the four dynasties of the [[Third Age of Calimshan]].",
        "Organization": "Like the dynasties of the previous age, the Raors ruled as [[bakkal]] [[priests]] over Calimshan.",
        "Base of Operations": "The seat of power of the Raor bakkals was located in the city of [[Calimport]].",
        "Activities": "The Raor Dynasty saw the empire of Calimshan expand to include Calimshan proper, [[Tethyr]], [[Iltkazar (disambiguation)|Iltkazar]], and [[Mir]], stretching as far north as the [[Snowflake Mountains]].",
        "History": "Little is remembered about the Raor Dynasty, beyond the fact that it ushered in Calimshan's Third Age and the greatest extent of its empire. The dynasty was founded in {{Yearlink|-1900}}.\n\nDuring the Raor dynasty, the [[Caltazar Hills]] became a place of constant conflict with the [[Alimir Hive]] of [[beholder]]s, which would escalate for many centuries.\n\nThe dynasty's short time was brought to a swift end in {{Yearlink|-1838}} by the [[Red dragon|red]] [[wyrm]] [[Ylveraasahlisar]] the Rose Dragon. Calishite [[adventurer]]s had killed one of her offspring in a raid of her horde. In revenge, she attacked the city of Calimport, destroying nearly two-thirds of the city, including the [[Caleph's Court]]. The army was decimated before her wrath, and the bakkal was slain. Ylveraasahlisar took the throne of the empire for herself and reigned for over a century."
