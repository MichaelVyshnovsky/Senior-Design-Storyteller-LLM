The '''Company of the Howling Harpoon''' was a mercenary band that aided the city of [[Hlondeth]] against [[Turmish]] invaders in [[146 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|146}} armies of Turmish under the command of Lord [[Dempster Turmish|Dempster]] besieged the nation's old enemy â€“ the city-state of Hlondeth. While the front assault was broken by the city's defenders, the Company of the Howling Harpoon flanked Turmite armies. The mercenaries destroyed Dempster's food supplies and siege mechanisms, forcing the invading army to retreat.
