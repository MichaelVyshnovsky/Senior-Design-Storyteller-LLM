        "mainbody": "The Gray Ghosts were the only true thieves guild of Gracklstugh. They were filled with derro and duergar outcasts and a few escaped slaves.\nThe Gray Ghosts had a special interest in a ruined black obelisk they had found that they believed contained \"unimaginable power\", so they tried to recollect all the fragments of the obelisk and rebuild it.\nCirca 1486 DR, the Gray Ghosts stole a red dragon egg intended to replace Themberchaud as the Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh from the Keepers of the Flame. The Keepers used all their strength to eradicate the thieves and captured and executed the Gray Ghosts leader. The guild was then led by a triumvirate of renegade derro savants&mdashUskvil and the twin sisters Aliinka and Zubriska."
