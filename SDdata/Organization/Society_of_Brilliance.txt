The '''Society of Brilliance''' was a neutral society consisting of a few scholars representing various races in the [[Underdark]].
{{Quote|We are small in number, and rarely stay in one place for long. My colleagues and I are working to improve the conditions in the Underdark. This not need be such a hostile place.|[[Blurg]].}}

==Dogma==
Their goal was to study the Underdark, hoping to gain a better understanding about the terrain where they lived.

==Abilities==
Each member of the society garnered the ability to cast the spell ''[[teleport]]'' once per day, to a destination within {{SI|30|ft}} of a fellow member.

==Relationships==
The organization counted among its allies [[Lenore De Hurst]], the [[Mystran]] cleric of the [[Arcane Tower]].{{cite game/Baldur's Gate III}}

[[Esther|Lady Esther]] played a role in supplying and executing the tasks necessary for the society's research efforts. Among her tasks was the obtaining of a [[githyanki]] egg from the [[Rosymorn Monastery]] for [[Havkelaag]]'s researches on the nature of evil.

==Headquarters==
The society had a house called the [[Lodge of the Society of Brilliance]] in [[Baldur's Gate/Lower City|Lower City]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. The place was used as a library, a dormitory, a museum and a warehouse at the same time.

==History==
As follows from the book ''[[An History of the Society of Brilliance as Told by Its Members]]'', the Society of Brilliance was founded during a meeting between [[Omeluum]], [[Grazilaxx]], [[Blurg]], [[Sloopidoop]], [[Y]], and [[Skriss]]. Since then the society continued to grow in numbers, but it still remained quite small in the {{YearlinkName|1492}}.

Some members went on a pilgrimage to [[Gravenhollow]] some years before era of events of the [[Second Sundering]]. In 1492 [[DR]] there was the ''[[Letter concerning Gravenhollow]]'' which could be found in the Lodge. The letter for [[Aenrahel]] was written by [[Dhunyl]], a scholar who informed about his departure to study the knowledge of the library.

Some time around the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, members of the society began to investigate the [[faerzress]] of the Underdark, specifically its relation to reports about a "demonic incursion" from the depths of the [[Abyss]].

The research notes from the book ''[[The Lost Tomb of Khaem (book)|The Lost Tomb of Khaem]]'' chronicled numerous endeavors to discover the actual [[Lost Tomb of Khaem|tomb]] over the course of the society's existence.

Within the society, individuals explored an array of subjects, some of which were unrelated to the Underdark. An unknown member of the Society of Brilliance spent time interviewing throat-singer [[Quil Grootslang]] to obtain information about the [[dragonborn]] society.

The society published the works of peers and applicants for membership making edits and additions before publishing. Among those works was the thesis called ''[[Study on the Representation of Deep Gnomes in Mid-Century Drow Literature]]''.

Amidst the [[Absolute crisis]], the Society of Brilliance faced threats from inhabitants of Baldur's Gate, driven by escalating panic and xenophobia, particularly because of the presence of [[Mind flayer|illithids]] among the society's members.

==Known Members==
The founding members of the society included:
* [[Y]], a [[derro]] savant.
* [[Blurg]], the thoughtful [[orog]] scholar.
* [[Grazilaxx]], an illithid.
* [[Skriss]], a [[troglodyte]].
* [[Sloopidoop]], a [[kuo-toa]] archpriest.
* [[Omeluum]], a kind and understanding mind flayer who was born with [[sorcerous]] powers.

The other known members included:
* [[Delverdenn]], a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] ore specialist.
* [[Havkelaag]], a duergar researcher of the nature of [[evil]].
* [[Limeleech]], a [[drow]] scholar.
* [[Lorlarrio]], a [[duergar]] [[Languages|linguist]].
* [[Moorcombe]], a [[deep gnome]] [[Spores|spore]] researcher.
