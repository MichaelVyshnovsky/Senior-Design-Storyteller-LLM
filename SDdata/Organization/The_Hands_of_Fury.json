        "mainbody": "The Hands of Fury was a cruel and unpleasant adventuring band assembled by Makados, a Stormlord of Talos, active circa 1312 DR.\nThe Hands of Fury was assembled sometime before the  by a proud, rowdy, and overbearing Talassan priest named Makados. Along with a bloodthirsty barbarian named Dahel Bloody-Four, Makados was on the groups frontlines, brutalizing and harassing anything and anyone the troupe encountered. Another warrior member of the group was Amraith, a dispossessed elven noble, a cold-natured and quick-minded man. Mirai Wainwright was the groups only wizard, a physically strong woman of equally strong will. The partys rogue was a dwarven outcast, Harbesh Carver, a thug for lack of a better description. Lastly, Fissera was a malicious druid who kept to the flank when in battle but was ready to unleash natures wrath upon command.\nIn 1312 DR, The Hands of Fury traveled aboard a pirate ship to the city of Luskan, ending up stranded there after the further marine plans fell apart. Seeing no other opportunities for profit, the troupe answered a call for mercenaries coming from the far northern town of Targos, which was besieged by the Legion of the Chimera."
