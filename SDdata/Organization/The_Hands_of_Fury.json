        "mainbody": "'''The Hands of Fury''' was a cruel and unpleasant adventuring band assembled by [[Makados]], a [[Stormlord]] of [[Talos]], active ''circa'' [[1312 DR]].",
        "History": "The Hands of Fury was assembled sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1312}} by a proud, rowdy, and overbearing [[Talassan]] [[priest]] named Makados. Along with a bloodthirsty [[barbarian]] named [[Dahel Bloody-Four]], Makados was on the group's frontlines, brutalizing and harassing anything and anyone the troupe encountered. Another warrior member of the group was [[Amraith]], a dispossessed [[elf|elven]] noble, a cold-natured and quick-minded man. [[Mirai Wainwright]] was the group's only [[wizard]], a physically strong woman of equally strong will. The party's [[rogue]] was a [[dwarf|dwarven]] outcast, [[Harbesh Carver]], a thug for lack of a better description. Lastly, [[Fissera]] was a malicious [[druid]] who kept to the flank when in battle but was ready to unleash nature's wrath upon command.\n\nIn 1312 DR, The Hands of Fury traveled aboard a pirate ship to the city of [[Luskan]], ending up stranded there after the further marine plans fell apart. Seeing no other opportunities for profit, the troupe answered a call for mercenaries coming from the far northern town of [[Targos]], which was besieged by the [[Legion of the Chimera]]."
