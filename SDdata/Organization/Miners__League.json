        "mainbody": "The '''Miners' League''' was a prominent guild of miners and ore extractors based in the [[Eileanar]] [[enclave]] during ancient [[Netheril]].",
        "Organization": "The guild was owned by the [[arcanist]] [[Gneissenau]], with the assistance of several managers. [[Philo]] and [[Lebreton]] managed the Delver's Consortium that made up the guild's 300 miners, [[Jackson]] oversaw the extraction of metals, while [[Wackernagel]] and [[Ochsenbein]] handled the various arcanists and seers who divined the locations of rich metal deposits around the world.",
        "Activities": "The League specialized in the mining and extraction of [[gold]]. A great breakthrough came about in {{yearlinkConvert|3515|NY}} when Gneissenau developed a surprisingly simple process that allowed for completely pure gold to be extracted from ore, using only [[mercury]] and ''[[portal]]s'' to the [[planes]] of [[Elemental Plane of Fire|Fire]], [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Vacuum|Vacuum]], and [[Para-Elemental Plane of Ice|Ice]]. This allowed them to produce pure gold in a consistent and relatively cheap manner."
