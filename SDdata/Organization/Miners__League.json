Philo and Lebreton managed the Delvers Consortium that made up the guilds 300 miners, Jackson oversaw the extraction of metals, while Wackernagel and Ochsenbein handled the various arcanists and seers who divined the locations of rich metal deposits around the world.\nThe League specialized in the mining and extraction of gold. A great breakthrough came about in  when Gneissenau developed a surprisingly simple process that allowed for completely pure gold to be extracted from ore, using only mercury and portals to the planes of Fire, Vacuum, and Ice. This allowed them to produce pure gold in a consistent and relatively cheap manner."
