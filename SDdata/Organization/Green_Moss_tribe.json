        "mainbody": "The Green Moss tribe was a group of orcs and half-orcs who lived in Icewind Dale.Although never referred to by name in Half-Orcs of the Many-Arrows Tribe, the Green Moss tribes homelands are described as being \"on the tundra to the north of the Spine of the World\", a description that only matches Icewind Dale. Shortly after Obould I founded the kingdom of Many-Arrows in the , the tribe joined the nascent kingdom under chieftain Llogh Green Moss.\nMembers of the tribe were famous as guides for those wishing to navigate the Spine of the World.\nThe Green Moss tribe had a healthy trading relationship with Silverymoon, selling them unique flora, fauna, and minerals from Icewind Dale not found elsewhere.\nLong before the formation of Many-Arrows, the Green Moss tribe grew out of two groups driven into Icewind Dale from south of the Spine of the World. The first was a community of Aurilians originally from Silverymoon, exiled due to their association with the Frostmaiden. The second group, a pacifistic orc tribe driven out by their more warlike peers, arrived shortly after. The unified tribe was formed out of necessity, as either group was unable to survive the harsh climate on its own.\nAlthough worship of Auril persisted for a time among the Green Moss tribe, over the generations, it gradually shifted towards the veneration of primal spirits, resulting in the adoption of a druidic tradition.\nWhen Obould I reached out to the Green Moss tribe during the foundational period of Many-Arrows, he invited half-orc chieftain Llogh Green Moss to join his court of advisors. Controversial among the more warlike chieftains of Many-Arrows, Llogh advocated for pursuing peace and trade between the nation and its former enemies.\nSometime in , in the lead-up to Many-Arrows involvement in the War of the Silver Marches, chieftain Ozkur Green Moss conspired with the chieftains of the Bloodblade tribe and the Dust-Treader tribe to secede from the kingdom and flee south."
