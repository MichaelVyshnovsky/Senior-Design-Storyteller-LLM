Shortly after [[Obould I]] founded the kingdom of [[Many-Arrows]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the tribe joined the nascent kingdom under chieftain [[Llogh Green Moss]].",
        "Activities": "Members of the tribe were famous as guides for those wishing to navigate the [[Spine of the World]].",
        "Relationships": "The Green Moss tribe had a healthy trading relationship with [[Silverymoon]], selling them unique flora, fauna, and minerals from Icewind Dale<ref group=note name=\"IDnote\" /> not found elsewhere.",
        "History": "Long before the formation of Many-Arrows, the Green Moss tribe grew out of two groups driven into Icewind Dale<ref group=note name=\"IDnote\" /> from south of the Spine of the World. The first was a community of [[Auril]]ians originally from Silverymoon, exiled due to their association with the Frostmaiden. The second group, a pacifistic orc tribe driven out by their more warlike peers, arrived shortly after. The unified tribe was formed out of necessity, as either group was unable to survive the harsh climate on its own.\n\nAlthough worship of Auril persisted for a time among the Green Moss tribe, over the generations, it gradually shifted towards the veneration of [[primal spirit]]s, resulting in the adoption of a [[druid]]ic tradition.\n\nWhen Obould I reached out to the Green Moss tribe during the foundational period of Many-Arrows, he invited half-orc chieftain Llogh Green Moss to join his court of advisors. Controversial among the more warlike chieftains of Many-Arrows, Llogh advocated for pursuing peace and trade between the nation and its former enemies.\n\nSometime in {{YearlinkName|1484}}, in the lead-up to Many-Arrows' involvement in the [[War of the Silver Marches]], chieftain [[Ozkur Green Moss]] conspired with the chieftains of the [[Bloodblade tribe]] and the [[Dust-Treader tribe]] to secede from the kingdom and flee south."
