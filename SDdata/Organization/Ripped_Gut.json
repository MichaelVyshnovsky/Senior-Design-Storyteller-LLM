        "Activities": "Periodically, the Ripped Gut orcs would find a host body, a live woman of a certain appearance, to placate the restless spirit, [[Aumathra]], who watched over them. When she was in possession of one of these supplications, Aumathra would order the Ripped Gut orcs as her minions, on a spree of ransacking local ruins.",
        "Leadership": "The tribe was led by \"Old Gut\" [[Arlagh Deathclaw]], who in turn was served by a council of elders. Among the important figures of the tribe were the chieftain's son, [[Ragrath Deathclaw|Ragrath]], and the older [[cleric]] of [[Gruumsh]], [[Orauth Skullstone]].",
        "History": "Some centuries before the [[Time of Troubles]], Aumathra lived with the Ripped Gut orcs as a young woman. She was a [[sorceress]] who had been exiled by her own people."
