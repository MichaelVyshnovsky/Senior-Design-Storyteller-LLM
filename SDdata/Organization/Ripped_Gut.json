        "mainbody": "The Ripped Gut tribe was a group of orcs that lived in the network of caves called Baraskur, which was located in the northern slopes of the Nether Mountains.\nPeriodically, the Ripped Gut orcs would find a host body, a live woman of a certain appearance, to placate the restless spirit, Aumathra, who watched over them. When she was in possession of one of these supplications, Aumathra would order the Ripped Gut orcs as her minions, on a spree of ransacking local ruins.\nThe tribe was led by \"Old Gut\" Arlagh Deathclaw, who in turn was served by a council of elders. Among the important figures of the tribe were the chieftains son, Ragrath, and the older cleric of Gruumsh, Orauth Skullstone.\nSome centuries before the Time of Troubles, Aumathra lived with the Ripped Gut orcs as a young woman. She was a sorceress who had been exiled by her own people."
