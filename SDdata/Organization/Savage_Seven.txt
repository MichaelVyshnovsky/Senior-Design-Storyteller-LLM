The '''Savage Seven''' was an [[adventuring company]] based in [[northwest Faerûn]].

==Activities==
The Savage Seven was often hired to assassinate various [[giant]]s and [[goblinoid]]s (including [[orc]] chieftains and [[half-orc]] spies). They received their tasks from their agent, the lantern-maker [[Zorth Ulmaril]] of [[Presper Street]] in [[Waterdeep]].

==History==
Around [[1357 DR]], the Savage Seven killed the giant [[Tyrus|Tyrus of the Peaks]] near [[Mirabar]]. Before that they protected a [[merchant]] caravan to [[Luskan]] from [[bandit]]s hired by a rival Luskan merchant.
 
==Members==
All seven were [[human]] males.
