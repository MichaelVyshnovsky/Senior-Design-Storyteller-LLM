The Savage Seven was an adventuring company based in northwest Faer√ªn.
The Savage Seven was often hired to assassinate various giants and goblinoids (including orc chieftains and half-orc spies). They received their tasks from their agent, the lantern-maker Zorth Ulmaril of Presper Street in Waterdeep.
Around 1357 DR, the Savage Seven killed the giant Tyrus of the Peaks near Mirabar. Before that they protected a merchant caravan to Luskan from bandits hired by a rival Luskan merchant.
All seven were human males.
