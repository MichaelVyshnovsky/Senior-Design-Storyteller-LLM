The '''Flass''' were an old [[noble]] family from [[Thay]].

==Activities==
As members of the nobility, the Flass family were among the rulers of Thay, and counted many prominent [[Red Wizards]] and at least one [[Tharchion]] among their name. As Thayvian nobles, even members without positions of formal power were referred to with the honorifics of "Daeron"/"Daeronness" (literally, "noble-born"), or with "Sir"/"Mistress", "Your Excellency", or "Your Honor".

Members of the family shaved their heads and wore [[tattoo]]s or body paint, as per Thayvian custom.

==History==
The Flass were an ancient [[Mulan]] noble family from [[Mulhorand]]. They were among the most influential Thayvian families as of the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]], however they were clearly in decline by that time.

==Members==
Notable members of the family included:

* [[Nyressa Flass]], the [[Zulkir]] of [[Necromancy]] as of the 12{{th}} century [[DR]], also known as "the [[Vampire]] Zulkir".
* [[Dmitra Flass]], the Tharchion of [[Eltabbar (tharch)|Eltabbar]] throughout the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, also known as "The Tharchioness" or the "First Princess of Thay".
