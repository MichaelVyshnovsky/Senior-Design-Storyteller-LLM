        "mainbody": "The '''Absolution Council''' was the parole committee of [[Revel's End]] prison in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. These ten individuals thus determined when&mdash;or if&mdash;to release any of the prisoners back into society.{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}}",
        "Activities": "The Councilors each came from one of the member cities or towns of the [[Lords' Alliance]] and had the duty of deciding the fates of the Alliance's worst prisoners, including spies and traitors. \n\nWhen one or more members of the Council believed that a prisoner was eligible for parole or pardon, they would hold a meeting to discuss whether to commute that inmate's sentence. Prisoners were given a chance to appeal their case before the assembled councilors prior to a vote being held. If the committee deadlocked, then the prison warden&mdash;a neutral party among the Lords' Alliance members&mdash;would cast the deciding vote. Any given prisoner could be recommended for such a hearing once each year.",
        "Base of Operations": "Meetings were held in the [[Revel's_End#Interior|Hall of Absolution]] on the second story of the central tower of Revel's End. This room was also where the Council gathered for safety whenever the prison went on high alert.\n\nThe Hall of Absolution was decorated with banners bearing the symbol of the Lords' Alliance. Prisoners up for parole were [[Manacles|manacled]] and brought to stand before a large curved table that dominated the room. Behind this table were eleven high-backed chairs, with the five on the left and the right each adorned with the symbol of a member of the Lords' Alliance, indicating the councilor who would sit there during hearings. These hearings were always attended by the prison warden, who sat in the unadorned central chair. The Absolution Council could also meet in a small chamber with a round window; they sat behind a table with places for only four members.\n\nThe councilors also had personal quarters at the prison. These were ten small and modest rooms that lined a narrow hallway located beneath the [[Windbreak]],",

        "History": "In the late 1490s [[DR]],{{HAT-time}} an Absolution Council comprising Jarnathan, Kriv Norixius, Voss Anderton, and Jil Torbo met in Revel's End to consider a pardon for [[Edgin Darvis]] and [[Holga Kilgore]] for the crimes of skulduggery and grand larceny. However, a storm delayed Jarnathan's journey so the council started without him, but Edgin kept inquiring about Jarnathan's absence, when he'd arrive, and how unfortunate it was that he'd miss out on his story. He hoped that Jarnathan would free them.<ref> And he would, just not in the way that anyone expected. When Jarnathan entered, Edgin enacted his 'plan', with him and Holga fighting off the guards, grabbing the aarakocra, and jumping through the window,<ref> forcing him to fly them to ice below. Jarnathan was knocked out by the hard landing, but survived.<ref>\n\nMore than a year later, the same council met to consider [[Forge Fitzwilliam]] for pardon, but were wise to the same tricks and refused him. Forge also grabbed Jarnathan and tried to jump through the window, only to find it bricked up behind a curtain, stunning both himself and the poor aarakocra."
