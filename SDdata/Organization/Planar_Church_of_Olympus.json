        "mainbody": "The '''Planar Church of Olympus''' was a religious organization present across various [[crystal sphere]]s that was dedicated to the veneration of the [[Arborea|Olympian Glades of Arborea]], the pinnacle of [[chaotic good]]ness in the [[Outer Planes]], as well as all of the [[deities]] that resided within it.",
        "Dogma": "This church solely venerated deities that resided within the plane of Arborea, This included almost all members of the [[Olympian pantheon]], most members of the [[Seldarine]], and some other varied Arborean powers.",
        "Bases": {
            "Notable Locations": "Within [[Realmspace]], the Church had [[Planar Church of Olympus (Bral)|a temple]] and sect within the city of [[Bral]], the sole city on the [[Rock of Bral]]."
        },
        "Equipment, Spells, and Relics": "Like any planar church, the [[priest]]s of this faith counted as [[polygot]]s. And due to venerating such a wide range of deities, the priests of this Church found themselves having access to their [[divine magic]] within the majority of crystal spheres.",
        "Relationships": "The members of this faith were generally accepting of those who had an Olympian power as their patron and were willing to grant them aid. However, priests of individual Olympian powers often found it hard to accept the Church's idea of worshiping the entire plane of Arborea. Priests of individual Arborean powers were also liable to ''[[commune]]'' with their deity to discern whether or not the Church was an acceptable form of veneration for them.\n\nIn terms of other planar churches, this Church had a good natured rivalry with the [[Planar Church of the Seven Heavens]]. With members of both clergies sometimes cooperating against [[evil]] causes."
