'''Adarbrent''' ({{Pronounce|ah|DAR|brent|refs=}}) was a [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble]] family that lived in [[Waterdeep]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were among the leading shipping clans as of {{Yearlink|1372}}, possessing the city's third-largest fleet and holding strong ties with the [[Master Mariners' Guild]].

Their headquarters was the [[Horizon Sails]] building within the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]].

==Organization==
As of [[1368 DR]], the patriarch of the Adarbrent family was [[Royus Adarbrent|Lord Royus Adarbrent]], with no acting consort. [[Alroy Adarbrent]] was Royus' eldest son and designated heir.On page 2 of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090603203800/http://www.wizards.com/dnd/files/Noble_House.zip Noble Houses Of Waterdeep Web Enhancement] it states there are only twenty-two members of the noble family. This wiki's [[Forgotten Realms Wiki:Canon#Hierarchy|policy]] prioritizes source books over online articles.

The majority of human family members were of [[Chondathan]] ethnicity.

==Activities==
The family were founding members of [[Horizon Armada]], a league of ship-owners among the city's nobility that managed the sea lanes, coordinated their various fleets, and commissioned maritime maps.

In the 1300s DR, the Adarbrent noble family of [[Waterdeep]] had pact a pact with the [[verdant prince]] known as King [[Witchthorn]] in [[Kryptgarden Forest]]. For decades the family sent its firstborn child of each generation to pledge an oath to Witchthorn. The children performed an unknown service to the king by their eleventh year and in exchange the family businesses and their homes were protected by secret fey guardians. This arrangement was unknown to all but the eldest son and daughter of each generation. The Adarbrents profited greatly from the arrangement and Witchthorn asked nothing in exchange, so they saw the mysterious [[fey]] as a paternal benefactor, heedless of whatever long-term plans he might have and the risk of binding each new generation to them.

==Base of Operations==
The family owned a [[Adarbrent Villa|villa]] in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]], on the east side of [[Shield Street]] between [[Julthoon Street]] and [[Manycats Alley]].

==History==
The family traveled from [[Cormyr]] to Waterdeep in the {{YearlinkName|1310}} to seek further wealth and prosperity with the [[Adarbrent Shipping Company]]. Finding immediate success, they quickly improved their station in life, joining Waterdeep's nobility in {{Yearlink|1317}}.

Lady Adarbrent gave birth to her third son, [[Ellis Adarbrent|Ellis]] in {{Yearlink|1344}}. Some time later she passed away. Lord Royus never stopped mourning her death.

In the spring of {{Yearlink|1372}}, the impulsive and adventurous [[Syllia Adarbrent|Syllia]] eloped to [[New Waterdeep]] with her lover, and fellow Harper, [[Farid al-Nisr]]. Lord Royus and her brothers didn't respond well to the news.

While some of Royus's brothers in House Adarbrent became rich from the cross-sea trade with New Waterdeep on the continent of [[Maztica]], the [[Deepwater War]] left the family financially unsure. Following these developments, Lord Royus began to explore borrowing gold, at a very low interest rate, from [[Fahd yn Sarsor al-Nisr]], Syllia's father-in-law.
