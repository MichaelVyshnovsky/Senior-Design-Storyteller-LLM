House Shobalar was a drow house of Menzoberranzan of the 14 century DR.
The house was uncharacteristically reclusive, even by Menzoberranzan standards, being notable for specializing in arcane magic and producing several female wizards of considerable power. The house guard was made up of magically bred giant spiders. The house was renowned for its spider cavalry.
Shobalar maintained an outpost, Sezzia, where they conducted arcane research.
At a young age, Liriel Baenre was given by her father, Gromph Baenre, to House Shobalar to be trained in the ways of magic.
House Shobalar was destroyed during the War of the Spider Queen as punishment for women practicing arcane, rather than divine, magic.
