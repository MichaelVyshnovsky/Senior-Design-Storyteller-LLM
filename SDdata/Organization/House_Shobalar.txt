'''House Shobalar''' was a [[drow]] house of [[Menzoberranzan]] of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Description==
The house was uncharacteristically reclusive, even by Menzoberranzan standards, being notable for specializing in arcane magic and producing several female [[wizard]]s of considerable power. The house guard was made up of magically bred [[giant spider]]s. The house was renowned for its spider cavalry.

Shobalar maintained an outpost, [[Sezz'ia]], where they conducted [[arcane]] research.

==History==
At a young age, [[Liriel Baenre]] was given by her father, [[Gromph Baenre]], to House Shobalar to be trained in the ways of magic.

House Shobalar was destroyed during the [[War of the Spider Queen]] as punishment for women practicing arcane, rather than divine, magic.

==Notable Members==
* [[Hinkutes'nat Alar Shobalar]]: [[matron mother]] in [[1348 DR]].
* [[Pu'Nel Aalar]]: weapon master.
* [[Vilto'sat Shobalar]]: captain of the spider cavalry of the house, killed in [[1373 DR]].
* [[Xandra Shobalar]]: third daughter of Hinkutes'nat, Mistress of Magic, instructor of [[Liriel Baenre]].
* [[Bythnara Shobalar]]: daughter of Xandra. Killed in [[1361 DR]] by Liriel Baenre.
