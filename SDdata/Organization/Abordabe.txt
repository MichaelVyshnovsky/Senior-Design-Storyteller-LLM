The Abordabe were a tribe of Nar found in Narfell.
Roughly 4,000 Nar comprised the Abordabe, making them the largest tribe found within Narfell.
Perhaps because of their vast numbers, the Abordabe oversaw the Trade Fair on a yearly basis.
Contrary to many of the tribes scattered throughout Narfell, the Abordabe viewed outsiders as a potential source of wealth, making them more willing to trade instead of attack on sight.
The Abordabe ranged mostly between Harks Finger and the western banks of the Teardrops.
