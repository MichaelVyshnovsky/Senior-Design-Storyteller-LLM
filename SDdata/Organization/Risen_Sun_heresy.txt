The Risen Sun heresy was the belief that the time of Lathanders transformation was nigh and Amaunator was about to return. The Brotherhood of the Glorious Sun has long existed within the church of Lathander, tolerated by other followers of the Morninglord and preaching that Lathander was the reincarnated form of Amaunator. Believers of the Risen Sun take this one step further into heresy.
Sunlord Daelegoth Orndeir, the leader of the Brotherhood, has embraced the Risen Sun heresy and since 1374 DR has sought to make it the core belief system of those faithful to Lathander. He has accomplished this by recruiting converts to the faith of Amaunator through preaching and performing miracles.
Risen Sun heretics have access to the Fire, Law, Nobility, Renewal, Sun, and Time spell domains. Their favored weapon was the light mace. On casting, weapon of the deity, their light mace turned into a flaming light mace.
Those who subscribed to this philosophy were capable of becoming sunmasters.
