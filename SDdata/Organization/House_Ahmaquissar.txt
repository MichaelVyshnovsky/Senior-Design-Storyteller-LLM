House Ahmaquissar was an elven house. 
It is known for accommodating minstrels, thieves and con artists. Members commonly ventured to Faer√ªn to ply their roguish trades before returning to Evermeet to evade punishment.
The house possessed several estates on Evermeet, but its main estate in Leuthilspar was a wood and marble building.
* Lysanthir Ahmaquissar, leader of the house in 1367 DR.
