        "mainbody": "'''House Shobalar''' was a [[drow]] house of [[Menzoberranzan]] of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Description": "The house was uncharacteristically reclusive, even by Menzoberranzan standards, being notable for specializing in arcane magic and producing several female [[wizard]]s of considerable power. The house guard was made up of magically bred [[giant spider]]s. The house was renowned for its spider cavalry.\n\nShobalar maintained an outpost, [[Sezz'ia]], where they conducted [[arcane]] research.",
        "History": "At a young age, [[Liriel Baenre]] was given by her father, [[Gromph Baenre]], to House Shobalar to be trained in the ways of magic.\n\nHouse Shobalar was destroyed during the [[War of the Spider Queen]] as punishment for women practicing arcane, rather than divine, magic.",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Hinkutes'nat Alar Shobalar]]: [[matron mother]] in [[1348 DR]].\n* [[Pu'Nel Aalar]]: weapon master.\n* [[Vilto'sat Shobalar]]: captain of the spider cavalry of the house, killed in [[1373 DR]].\n* [[Xandra Shobalar]]: third daughter of Hinkutes'nat, Mistress of Magic, instructor of [[Liriel Baenre]].\n* [[Bythnara Shobalar]]: daughter of Xandra. Killed in [[1361 DR]] by Liriel Baenre."
