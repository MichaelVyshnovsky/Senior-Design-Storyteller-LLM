        "mainbody": "The '''Spellguard''' was an organization of powerful, militaristic [[mage]]s in [[Silverymoon]], who served as the city's protectors, the personal guard of its ruler and patrons of its illustrious [[Conclave of Silverymoon|college of magical learning]]. They kept watch over the city's ''[[mythal]]'' and its [[Wards of Silverymoon|protective wards]], until it was destroyed in the [[Spellplague]], an event which strengthened their resolve as guardians of knowledge in [[the North]].",
        "Membership": {
            "Requirements and benefits": "Service within the order was strictly on a volunteer basis, and members were free to retire whenever they chose. They were expected to turn in their ''adrath token'' but retained all the abilities and knowledge they had gained while in service.\n\nMages were required to serve two days out of every [[tenday]] on active duty, either within the city or patrolling the surrounding areas, and earned a salary of at least 50 [[gp]] per month, or 250 gp/month for the Warders. This dutiful service was came with certain reverence and authority, as Spellguards commanded significant respect in [[Luruar]] and the surrounding lands. Many long-serving members were high-ranking politicians within the League of Silver Marches.\n\nServing within the Spellguard was often a requirement for joining the Conclave of Silverymoon.",
            "Organization": "The Spellguard was not a conclave or loosely-structured guild of mages, rather a fully-functioning military organization. As of the late 14{{th}} century, they numbered 25 members whose activities were overseen by seven ''Warders'', all serving under the guidance of the Lord Warder [[Jorus Azuremantle]]."
        },
        "Duties": "The primary duty of the Spellguard was to defend the Silvaren citizens from the many threats of the North, including monster attacks and [[evil]] spellcasters. The region was regularly troubled by attacks from [[troll]]s, [[drow]], [[giant]]s and even more malicious beasts. The Spellguard worked closely with the [[Knights in Silver]] when the city was threatened by the more mundane dangers of the North.\n\nThe High Palace of Silverymoon was always protected by at least one Warder and two Spellguards.",
        "Powers": "Once they gained entry into the order, Spellguards of Silverymoon were attuned to the city's ''mythal''. As such they were granted access to a number of unique spells, including ''[[Spellguard force lash|force lash]]'', ''[[mythal splinter]]'' and ''[[mythal spark]]''. These spells drew from the residual power of the ''mythal'', even in the years following its destruction.\n\nSpellguards were skilled in [[metamagic]], and focused on minimizing the collateral damage that could be caused by their battle-magic. Through significant practice, they were able to focus their magic, causing it to only effect or cause damage to certain races, creatures or specific sub-species, at their discretion.",
        "History": "The Spellguard were established by [[Taern Hornblade]] in [[1255 DR]], as an [[arcane]] bodyguard for [[Alustriel Silverhand]], but quickly grew in both number and skill, which garnered them more responsibility within the city. In the following years they grew to a city-wide force, spreading their duties between the High Palace and the rest of Silverymoon.\n\nFollowing the destruction of Silverymoon's ''mythal'' during the Spellplague, in the year [[1385 DR]], the Spellguard took on a more offensive role in their guardianship of the city, seeking out and hunting down threats to the capital of Luruar.",
        "Notable members": "*[[Taern Hornblade]]: The founder of the Spellguard was a noted member of the [[Harpers]] who ascended as the [[High Mage of Silverymoon]] after Alustriel.\n*[[Jorus Azuremantle]]: A member of the [[Council of the Marches]], Jorus took over the rank of Lord Warder after High Mage Hordblade."
