        "mainbody": "The '''House of Al-Kamari''' was one of the richest merchant families in [[Huzuz]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}\n\nThey claimed to make the finest silks in all of [[Toril|Al-Toril]].",
        "Organization": "The House of Al-Kamari owned the six largest storage buildings within the [[Warehouse District of Huzuz]]. In addition to this, they owned over a dozen factories within the [[Clothiers' District]] that processed their silk.\n\n[[Mu'izzi al-Kamar]] was the head of the Al-Kamari.\n\n[[Mamluk]]s from the [[Diligent Mamluk Society]] were employed to guard their wares.",
        "Base of Operations": "This merchant family was based out of Huzuz, the City of Delights.",
        "History": "Silk and other expensive fabrics were the focus of the House of Al-Kamari. The merchant house was able to instill pride in their workers, earning their careful attention to detail when handling the delicate [[silk]]. Much of their silk came from large [[mulberry]] orchards located south of Huzuz. Silk moths fed on the mulberry until their cocoons were harvested. The Al-Kamari conducted experiments to see if spider silk would be another viable option.\n\nAl-Kamari employed over 1,000 people in Huzuz, most of whom were women. They never hired anyone who had rough or calloused hands, fearing that a worker with rough hands would snag their silk.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "Because of their corruption by the [[yikaria]], which was unknown to the entirety of Huzuz, Al-Kamari were the unintentional enemies of the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]]."
