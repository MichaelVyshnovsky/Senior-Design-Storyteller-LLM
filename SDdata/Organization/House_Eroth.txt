'''House Eroth''' was a [[moon elf|silver elf]] house. 

==History==
As of [[1367 DR]], House Eroth was led by the elders and siblings [[Tanithil Eroth]] and [[Anaharae Eroth]]. Before the [[Retreat]], it was known for its [[ranger]]s and scouts, but these services were far less important on [[Evermeet]] and many become woodsmen instead. 

==Activities==
Eroth was a religious house, worshiping [[Angharradh]], [[Corellon Larethian]] and [[Rillifane Rallathil]]. The house was noted for its members' views, which often conflicted with those of the [[elves]] as a whole. For example, they did not recognize the authority of [[Amlaruil Moonflower|Queen Amlaruil Moonflower]] over the elven people. 

==Base of operations==
The house's estate consisted of small stone buildings in [[Leuthilspar]] connected by underground tunnels.

==Members==
*[[Tanithil Eroth]], elder of the house in 1367 DR and brother to Anaharae.
*[[Anaharae Eroth]], elder of the house in 1367 DR and sister to Tanithil.
