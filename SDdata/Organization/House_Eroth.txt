House Eroth was a silver elf house. 
As of 1367 DR, House Eroth was led by the elders and siblings Tanithil Eroth and Anaharae Eroth. Before the Retreat, it was known for its rangers and scouts, but these services were far less important on Evermeet and many become woodsmen instead. 
Eroth was a religious house, worshiping Angharradh, Corellon Larethian and Rillifane Rallathil. The house was noted for its members views, which often conflicted with those of the elves as a whole. For example, they did not recognize the authority of Queen Amlaruil Moonflower over the elven people. 
The houses estate consisted of small stone buildings in Leuthilspar connected by underground tunnels.
