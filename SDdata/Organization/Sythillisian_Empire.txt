The so-called '''Sythillisian Empire''' was an army of [[monstrous humanoid]]s and [[giant]]s under the leadership of [[ogre mage]] [[Sythillis]] and his wife [[Cyrvisnea]] who rampaged through [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
By the summer of [[1370 DR]], the troops of the Sythillisian Empire consisted of 30,000 [[kobold]]s, 24,000 [[goblin]]s, 10,000 [[hobgoblin]]s, 45 [[hill giant]]s, and 4,800 [[ogre]]s.

==Tactics==
Both leaders of the empire were patient tacticians. They spent a decade and a half recruiting and training kobolds, goblins, ogres, hill giants, and hobgoblins from the dreaded [[Underdark]].

==History==
Sythillis started assembling his so-called empire in the {{YearlinkName|1356}}. For the next fourteen years, the Sythillisian Empire swole in numbers and continuously trained for war. When internal conflicts weakened the nation of [[Amn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Sythillis and his wife Cyrvisnea gave the word to attack.

The ogre mages devised a plan to wait until armies of Amn move past the [[Small Teeth]] towards a distraction of [[Hillfort Torbold]]. When exposed and distracted, the Sythillisian Empire planned to attack [[Hillfort Ishla]] and eventually â€“ [[Esmeltaran]]. With the towns captured, the next step of the plan was to hold the position while the main forces of the empire moved to its true target, [[Murann]], and its [[gold]].

The armies were split into two parts, each led by one of the [[orge mage]] spouses. One part ransacked towns of [[Imnescar]] and [[Trademeet]], looting new arms and gear, and subsequently marching against Murann, laying siege, and later, ransacking the settlement. Ogre mage Cyrvisnea negotiated a five-year alliance with the [[Black Alaric]], leader of an outlaw fleet, to provide ransacked Muran with defenses against the empire's enemies.
