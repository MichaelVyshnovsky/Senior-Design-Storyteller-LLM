In 1370 DR, this guild was in the control of the sultan of Keltar, Duncan el Ashnarti, allowing him to control both illegal and legal activity there. Duncan was married to a niece of el Ahimar family, one of the four major crime families in Calimshan, which was in turn subservient to el Pesarkhal family and the syl-pasha himself, so the entire Ashnarti family and the underworld of Keltar was in control of Ralan el Pesarkhal.\n* The four major crime families of Calimshan in 1370 DR\n** El Pesarkhal\n** El Kahmir\n** El Vyndahla\n** El Ahimar\nCategoryCriminal organizations\nCategoryHuman houses\nCategoryOrganizations in Calimshan\nCategoryOrganizations in the Lands of Intrigue\nCategoryOrganizations in West Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\nCategoryOrganizations in Keltar\njws86jzzm8y8d3iqv9urgrtv0rbm5a6"
