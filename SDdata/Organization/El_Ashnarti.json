In [[1370 DR]], this guild was in the control of the sultan of Keltar, [[Duncan el Ashnarti]], allowing him to control both illegal and legal activity there. Duncan was married to a niece of [[el Ahimar]] family, one of the four major crime families in [[Calimshan]], which was in turn subservient to [[el Pesarkhal]] family and the [[syl-pasha]] himself, so the entire Ashnarti family and the underworld of Keltar was in control of [[Ralan el Pesarkhal]].<ref name=EotSS-p110/>",
