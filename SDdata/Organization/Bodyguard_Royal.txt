The Bodyguard Royal were a premier group of Purple Dragons in the late 14 century DR, tasked with guarding the royalty of Cormyr. 
The Bodyguard Royal consisted of some of the most competent Purple Dragons. They were meant to be loyal to the crown first and foremost. At a glance, their appointment by the then Royal Magician, Vangerdahast Aeiulvana, may have jeopardized this. In practice, however, Queen Filfaeril Obarskyr ensured only those who were more loyal to Azoun IV remained the closest.
Vangerdahast still selected the Bodyguards, but they received subsequent training and screening from Filfaeril, her senior chambermaid (a Harper), and two Highknights. Those who were more loyal to Vangerdahast were assigned to the door or to duties as distant envoys. Those trusted by Queen Filfaeril would remain close at hand, ready to guard her and Azoun IV in their most private and defenseless moments.
