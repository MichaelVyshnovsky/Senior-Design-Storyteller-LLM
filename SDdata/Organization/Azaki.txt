'''Azaki''' was an [[assassin]]s' guild of [[Kara-Tur]] that existed in the late 12{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Sometime ''circa'' the {{Yearlink|1172}}, the Azaki guild was plagued by the evil entity only known as [[The Calling]]. The mysterious creature elevated a minor attendant and his family within the guild's ranks in exchange for performing dark deeds and one day using the attendant's body to house itself on the [[Prime Material plane]]. When The Calling took over the attendant's body, it sowed chaos within Azaki, creating dozens of [[enchanted]] [[shuriken]]s called ''[[Many Talons]]'' in the process. Eventually, the attendant was slain by an unknown [[sohei]].
