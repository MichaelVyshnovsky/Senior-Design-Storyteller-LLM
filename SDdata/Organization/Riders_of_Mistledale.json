        "mainbody": "The Riders of Mistledale were a group of thirty mounted militia in Mistledale, in the Dalelands.\nThey were rarely formed into one single unit, but regularly undertook patrols, with three to four riders being accompanied by ten or twenty mounted troops.\nThe Riders would use black lacquered plate mail armor and a black helm, which displayed the white horse motif of Mistledale.\nAs of 1372 DR, the Barracks of the Riders was located at the north of the town of Ashabenford, in Mistledale. It was a walled compound with a courtyard used for training, and a small keephouse that was used as a jail.\nThe leader of the Council of Six, the ruling council of Mistledale, was also the leader of the Riders of Mistledale. Between 1367 and 1372 DR, this was Haresk Malorn.\nThe Captain was the military leader of the Riders of Mistledale, in contrast to the high councilors role as commander. The position of Swordar was second-in-command to the Captain.
