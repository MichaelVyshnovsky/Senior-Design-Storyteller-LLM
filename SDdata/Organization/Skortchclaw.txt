Skortchclaw was a large tribe of orcs located in the Spine of the World.
In 1370 DR, the clan leader, King Ugra Ngarl, was forcing goblin slaves to mine mithral from beneath Fortress Eyegad. Large quantities of the metal were being sold to a buyer in the High Forest.
In 1372 DR, Pharaun Mizzrym and Ryld Argith discovered the Skortchclaw symbol carved into a wall in the Braeryn district of the drow city of Menzoberranzan. That indicated isolated members of the Skortchclaw tribe in Menzoberranzan were involved in an uprising led by the alhoon Syrzan against the priestesses of the city.
