The '''Order of One Thousand Nightmares''' was a ghastly company of [[swordwraith]]s affiliated with [[Velsharoon]].

==Activities==
The Order haunted the [[Fields of the Dead]], fighting each other while riding their [[Nightmare (creature)|nightmares]] in battle. The clergy of Velsharoon mastered powerful magic allowing them to control the swordwraiths, forming a quickly growing undead army that only spelled trouble for the [[Western Heartlands]]. They numbered 200 strong as of [[1367 DR]].
