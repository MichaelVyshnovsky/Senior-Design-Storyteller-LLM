The '''church of Mask''', also known as the '''Circle of the Gray Ribbon''',In ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' the 'Circle of the Gray Ribbon' is an order of elite Maskarran thieves that achieved some level of notoriety. ''[[Ed Greenwood Presents Elminster's Forgotten Realms]]'' includes the 'Circle of the Gray Ribbon' an alternate name for the collective church as a whole. Due to the 100+ year difference between the two sourcebooks, both ideas are not mutually exclusive to one another. was the collective of individuals across the Realms that venerated [[Mask]], the ''Lord of Shadows'' and [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian god]] of trickery and deceit. While the church was viewed by many as mere scatterings of thieves and charlatans, the Maskarran faith was of the wealthiest churches in all [[Faerûn]]. They managed to achieve this feat despite operating primarily beyond the reach of lawfulness and in the shadows of civilized society.

{{Quote|Trust in the shadows, for the bright way makes of you an easy target.|Excerpt of the Maskarran dogma.}}

==Organization==
Mask's collective church was separated into individual priesthoods, each of operated independently in cities across Faerûn. These autonomous entities carried out unrelated operations to ensure thieves of different guilds did not interfere with neighboring enterprises. In those cities where multiple guilds conducted business within close proximity of each another, holy sites of Mask were considered neutral territory for everyone involved.

The extensive network of the Maskarran church comprised countless regional organizations and independent operators. Information and secrets flowed freely between various parties only to the extent that head clergy members deemed necessary. Their direction allowed church operations to best align with the ever-shifting landscape of religious and governmental politics.

===Titles===
Maskarran clergy members were known colloquially as '''Darkfingers''', but referred to each other as ''Brother/Sister Shadow'' regardless of their ranks.

Titles held by Maskarran clergy included:
* '''Lord/Lady Master''', the leader of a given temple.
* '''Hidden Ones''', high priests of the church.
* '''Master Brother/Sister'''
* '''Veteran Brother/Sister'''
* '''Proven Brother/Sister'''
* '''Unproved''', novices within the church.

==Activities==

{{Quote|Steal or deceive daily; the Lord of Shadows is most pleased if you manage both.|Creed of the Maskarran faith.}}

When partaking in the larcenous arts, Maskarrans most preferred to steal valuable [[gem]]s, as they were the absolute ideal offerings to the Lord of Shadows. Stealing these gems and replacing them with valueless replicas was considered the highest form of their craft. The longer the exchanged went undetected, the more perfect the crime in Mask's eyes.

Local priesthoods of Mask worked diligently to support their partnered thieves' guilds. Among the services and assets they provided were: pre-fabricated disguises, agents acting spies and informants, or the protection and seclusion of certain individuals, for a specified time. These church-sponsored boons were always granted for nominal fees, which were offered on top of the tithings regularly collected from the guilds.

If it was deemed necessary, Maskarran priests released large amounts of currency from their [[Church of Mask#Possessions|reserves]] into local economies. This was often done to manufacture increased costs of goods or spur inflation in certain cities or regions.

===Politics===
While Mask held domain over the [[portfolio]] of intrigue, Maskarran priests regularly participated in local politics. They wove intricate tapestries of lies, deceit, and misappropriation to cast a shroud over the other crimes their fellow faithful committed. Mask's followers were not above thrusting a whole realm into outright war if it would foster an environment of advantageous lawlessness.

==Rituals==
While not held on a regular date on the [[Calendar of Harptos]], the [[Ritual of the Unseen Presence]] was held at least once per month in each of Mask's temples. During this ceremony, clergy members conceded to Mask the wealth in [[currency]] they had acquired and melted it down before their temples' ''Altar of the Masked God''. This ritual, along with the church's darker rites, were always performed under the protection of [[conjuration|conjured]] ''[[striking shadows]]''.

The [[ritual of Shadow Walking]] was a sacred Maskarran ceremony by which one of the Shadowlord's faithful could attune their physical body to shadow itself. By performing this rite, they exchanged a portion of their life essence, and became what were known as [[shadow-walker]]s.

Some folks including pickpockets and other petty criminals would wear [[Mask's purse]], in clear view on their person. These simple pouches held a few coins that made easy targets for other thieves. The loss or acquisition of one of Mask's purses was seen as a small gift from the God of Thievery, or a sacrifice made to him in tribute.

===Prayer===
Maskarran clerics offered prayer at night, when under the cloak of darkness, or during times of need. A courtier appearing before a noble court or even a member of a political envoy would beseech Mask's favor to ensure favorable discussions.

During the daily 'Sunset Prayers', Maskarran clergy offered coins to their immediate superiors within the church's hierarchy, beginning with the Unproven. Once the Lord or Lady Master received their tribute, they presented it before the lowest-ranking clergy member as a token of appreciation for Mask's sardonic sense of humor.

==Celebrations==
While not a Maskarran holiday by any means, celebrants of [[Liar's Night]] often offered tribute to Mask and wore face coverings that resembled his [[holy symbol]].{{Cite adventurers league/Liar's Night|4,8}}

==Tactics==
Priests of Masks eschewed mere pickpocketing or burglary for more daring, large-scale heists, such as stealing every item within a single warehouse or an entire ship full of goods. They often masqueraded as mere peasants or priests of other faiths when carrying out their operations.

===Magic===
Spells unique to the Maskarran faith included ''[[dark way]]'', ''[[listening shadow]]'', ''[[Shadowcloak (spell)|shadowcloak]]'', ''[[watching shadow]]'', and ''[[striking shadows]]''.

==Base of Operations==
===Regions===
The Maskarran faith was prominent among criminals in many nations across Faerûn, including [[Telflamm]] in nation of [[Thesk]] Nearly every citizen of the city contributed in some way to the prosperity of the city's [[Shadowmasters of Telflamm|Shadowmasters]]. While many [[tiefling]]s across the Realms turned to the worship of Mask in lieu of [[Asmodeus]], the only recorded lineage of Maskarran tieflings originated from Thesk. many  

The faith was also quite popular in the [[Unapproachable East|eastern realm]] of [[Thay]], as well as cities in nearby [[Unther]] and [[Mulhorand]]. It was notable that Mask was the only non-native deity to garner any following of note in Mulhorand.

Worship of Mask was prohibited in the otherwise tolerant realm nations of the [[Shining Lands]].

===Temples===
While shrines to Mask could be found in many cities across the Realms, true temples only typically arose in cities that maintained fewer laws against thievery and burglary. Quite often these temples were constructed in hidden locales, with underground tunnels that granted easy access between them and their local thieves' guildhouse.

Undistinguished temples of Mask could be found within [[Tilverton]] in [[Cormyr]], [[Bezantur]] in Thay, and [[Westgate]] on the [[Dragon Coast]]. One long-forgotten shrine dedicated to Mask could be found deep within the [[Ithkyxan's lair|lair]] of the [[spirit naga]] [[Ithkyxan]], while at least one other was situated in the [[Street of White Roses]] in Bezantur.

Notable Maskarran temples included:
* [[House of the Master's Shadows]], in [[Telflamm]]; the largest temple of Mask in all of Faerûn.
* [[Telamuzhidah]], a major focal point for criminal activity in [[Calimport]].

==Possessions==
Collectively, Maskarran clergy held tremendous wealth stashed in secreted away caches. These riches were expertly directed to further the faith's agenda, whether by hiring skillful agents, bribing politicians, or other forms of solicitation. It was believed that only the [[church of Waukeen]] held more accumulated wealth within their coffers and among their holdings.

Individual priests were required to make an offering of a single valuable [[gem]], [[currency|coins]], or [[trade bar]]s equivalent of 2,000 [[gp]] to Mask's 'Shadowed Altar' every month.

===Dress===
{{Quote|The degree of law in a town can be seen on the face of a priest of Mask.|A common saying regarding Mask's servants.}}

As would be expected, clergy of Mask's church often wore no specific vestments or insignias that could be used to identify their allegiance while operating beyond their temple. This was especially true among the faithful that took on the adventuring lifestyle. These adventuring Maskarrans―along with many demarches/esses preferring simple [[leather armor]] or unassuming clothes befitting common folk of the lands they traveled.

During ceremonies and other rituals, Maskarran clergy wore flamboyant, vibrantly-colored tunics with puffed-out sleeves and striking embellishment. This striking attire was then covered in drab, hooded gray cloak, with the priest's face hidden behind a mask of black gauze. In lands where their faith was impinged upon, Mask's priests wore their gray robes in public as mark of his favor, along with a black [[wool]] mask, tailor-made to hide their features.

===Magic Items===
Senior members of the church often sponsored acquisition of certain [[item enchantment|enchanted items]] that aided the priesthood with their daily activities. Notable among these were ''[[ring of invisibility|rings of invisibility]]'', ''[[ring of shadow|rings of shadow]]'', ''[[rope of entanglement|ropes of entanglement]]'', and ''[[slippers of spider climbing]]''.

The ''[[Mask of Mysteries]]'' was a minorly [[item enchantment|enchanted]] [[silk]] mask that resembled those worn by Maskarran priests, but functioned as a type of [[arcane]] [[spellbook]]. Anyone wearing the mask that performed the correct actions to activate it, gained access to a select number of spells. It also smelled faintly of some unidentifiable [[spice]]s.

==Dogma==
===Beliefs===
Mask's followers believed that any events that occurred "within shadow" fell under his domain.

Maskarran clergy held a dynamic view of property rights and ownership of belongings. A individual or organization only held right of possession
over assets so long as they remained in their physical possession.

===Attitudes===
{{Quote|Wealth rightfully belongs to those who can acquire it...Honesty is for fools but apparent honesty is a very valuable thing.|''Excerpt of the charge taken by Mask's Unproven.''}}

Subtlety, caution, and discretion were virtuous held in the highest concern by the church. The ability to gain an edge over other with poised articulation―often utilizing feigned platitude―was considered a mark of distinction among clergy members. Integrity however was always maintained when working alongside other members of the church. Exemplary priests of Masks dutifully fulfilled the objectives proposed to their superiors within the church, even if numerous attempts were required for success.

==Orders==
While the church of Mask sponsored no knightly orders, a number of its more daring and calculating members joined the [[Circle of the Gray Ribbon]].

The [[Night Masks]] of [[Westgate]] were one of the numerous thieves' guilds of Faerûn that considered Mask as their patron deity. Yet others like the [[Shadow Thieves]] of [[Amn]], merely venerated the Lord of Shadows in name only.

==Classes==
Priesthoods of Mask predominantly comprised [[thieves]], [[cleric]]s, and [[specialty priest]]s known as [[demarche]]s or demarchesses.

A priest of Mask that chose to work specifically in large, densely-populated cities could take on the role of a [[catfoot]], whereas one that preferred to be out in the wilderness could join the ranks of the [[nightrunner]]s.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the [[Time of Troubles]] broke out across the Realms and the gods were sent down to [[Toril]] in mortal form. During that year, Mask took the form of a [[magic]]al sword called ''[[Godsbane]]'', which eventually fell into the possession of the mortal adventurer [[Cyric]]. At the culmination of those transformative events, Cyric ascended to godhood and took with him Mask's dominion over intrigue. That shift in divine [[portfolio]]s prompted Mask to redirect his followers' efforts across the Realms. They would no longer involved themselves in political schemes or public plots and focus their deception to a more personal and individual scope.
