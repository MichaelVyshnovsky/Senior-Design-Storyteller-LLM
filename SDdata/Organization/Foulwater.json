Not long later, the reborn Cult of the Dragon came to investigate and wound up slaying many of the Foulwater goblins.\nIn the end, the goblins and cultists came to an agreement. The goblins would allowed to remain within the dragons old cave, so long as they exclusively sold to the cult any items of interest found within.\nAfter the Zhentarim agent Chaab"
