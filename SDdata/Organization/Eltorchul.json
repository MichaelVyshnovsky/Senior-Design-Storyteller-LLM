        "mainbody": "House Eltorchul () was a noble family of Waterdeep. They were originally known for spice and imports but were later known for arcane research and schooling as well as the procurement of rare magical components.  \nthumb|right|270px|Map showing location of the Eltorchul villa (labeled $22) circa 1372 DR.\nThe family owned a villa in the Sea Ward on the southwest corner of Ivory Street and Diamond Street, which also faced Torch Lane and Pharras Alley. It was from there that they also ran an arcane academy aptly named the Eltorchul Academy.\nLord Thesp Eltorchul invested the familys spice and import fortune into the founding of the Eltorchul Academy around 1342 DR.\nSome of the Eltorchul sons were known for adventuring. They discovered a two-way gate into Undermountain. They sold the knowledge of the location of the gate to Lord Hund Hiilgauntlet for the erection of his tomb in Undermountain itself. Upon completion of the tomb, Hund trapped the workers and one of the Eltorchul sons within the tomb in order to keep its secret and to serve as undead guardians. Infuriated, the remaining brothers looted the Hiilgauntlet estate after a failed attempt at attacking the underground lair. They also destroyed the gate, trapping Hund in his tomb. Ironically, one of the brothers ended up marrying Hunds daughter and having many children by her.\nThe Eltorchul link to Undermountain continued when Thesps daughter, Errya Eltorchul, became one of Halasters Heirs and took up residence in Undermountain, where she sold somewhat accurate maps of the dungeon levels.\n*Thesp Eltorchul Patriarch of the noble house during the midâ€“14 century\n*Arus Eltorchul consort of Thesp \n*Fea Eltorchul heir apparent \n*Oth Eltorchul former heir apparent\n*Errya Eltorchul estranged daughter of Thesp and Arus"
