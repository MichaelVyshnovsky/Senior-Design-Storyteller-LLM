The '''Daunphar''' family was one of the elite clans that formed the [[Onsruur]] (the council of lords) in [[Khôltar]], the Iron City, ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|86}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 65: Khôltar, Part 16, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 3}}

==Organization==
This bloodline had no distinguishing features, leaving them rather plain in appearance. They eschewed politics as much as possible, but kept their hand in as necessary to maintain their position as an Onsruur member.

==Activities==
The Daunphars owned ranches and herds of livestock. They also enjoyed breeding horses.

==Relationships==
This family had some sort of mutually respectful, working relationship with a group of [[dwarves]] with questionable ethics that dwelled in the [[Great Rift]].
