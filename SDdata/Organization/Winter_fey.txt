The '''winter fey''' were a loosely organized faction of [[fey]] associated with winter, that is, "deadly cold, biting ice, and blinding snow".

The [[Prince of Frost]] was widely considered to be the most powerful of the winter fey, able to bend any spirit of winter to his will, though he was not truly their ruler: much of the time, the winter fey cleaved to their own schemes. However, when they gathered at the [[Court of Stars (Feywild)|Court of Stars]], they gathered under the Prince's banner, and the various lords and archfey amongst them would typically gather when he called for war.{{Cite dragon/374/Court of Stars: The Prince of Frost|60}} Additionally, only the winter fey were comfortable in the [[Vale of Long Night]].<ref>

At times, when the Prince of Frost called the lords of winter together, they were called the Winter Court.

Another archfey of the winter fey was [[Koliada]] the Winter Witch. The [[iceling]]s, small winter fey that often served various more powerful winter fey as servants and spies, were rumored to serve her even when their apparent loyalties were elsewhere.<ref name=Dun169">{{Cite dungeon/162/Winter of the Witch|58-59}}
