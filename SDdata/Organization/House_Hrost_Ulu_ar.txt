'''House Hrost Ulu'ar''' was one of the ruling [[drow]] Houses of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the [[Northdark]] in the late 13{{th}} and early 14{{th}} centuries [[DR]].

==History==
House Hrost Ulu'ar rose to its [[Ruling Council]] status sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1297}}, when it held the seat of the fifth House of Menzoberranzan. By the {{YearlinkName|1328}}, Hrost Ulu'ar took the fourth House's place after the fall of [[House DeVir]]. However, 1328 DR also took House Hrost Ulu'ar's seat, leaving it likely completely destroyed at the hands of [[House Xorlarrin]],
