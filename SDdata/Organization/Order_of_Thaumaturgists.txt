The Order of Thaumaturgists was a collection of wizards who worshiped Karsus, the Momentary God.
Many of these wizards researched new spells after Mystryls fall and the ensuing change in the nature of magic. Some of their ancient tomes could still be found within the ruins of towers in the Dire Wood.
Every wizard within the Order was also part of the Cult of Karsus.
