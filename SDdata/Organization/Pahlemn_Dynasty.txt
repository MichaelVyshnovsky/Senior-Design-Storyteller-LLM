The '''Pahlemn Dynasty'''{{Pahlemn spelling}} was the first of six dynasties of the [[Second Age of Calimshan]].

==Organization==
Like the rulers before them, the leaders of the Pahlemn Dynasty were [[bakkal]]s, or high [[priest]]s of their people.

==Activities==
The rulers of this dynasty were relatively peaceful. They did not war with the [[dwarves]] of [[Shanatar]], but they maintained control of the [[Mir]] region.

==Base of Operations==
The bakkal's palace was located in the city of [[Calimport]].

==History==
The Pahlemn Dynasty succeeded the previous [[Marekh Dynasty]]{{Marekh spelling}} in {{Yearlink|-3250}}, after the former dynasty's rulers all died from the [[Sunset Plague]]. The Pahlemns ruled for an unprecedented 421 years, ending in {{Yearlink|-2829}} with the rise of the warlike [[Tavihr Dynasty]].

==Trivia==
One of the ''[[sabbans]]'' in the city of Calimport was named after this dynasty, [[Pahlemn Sabban]] in [[Caravan Ward]].
