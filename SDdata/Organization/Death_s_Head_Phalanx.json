        "mainbody": "he Deaths Head Phalanx was a band of hobgoblins led by the warlord Doomcrown that settled within Undermountain during the late 15 century DR. They had aligned themselves with the fire giant Emberosa and her kin during their plot to conquer Waterdeep and the the North and bring about the rise of the fire giants within the ordning of giant kind.\nAs Doomcrown and his band believed fire giants could sweep over and conquer the surface realms of Faerûn, they set their eventual sights on the High Forest. The Deaths Head warlord believed the fire giants could purge the forest and the Phalanx could seize it as their own domain.\nTo this end, the Deaths Head Phalanx protected Emberosa and the giants as they worked on creating an enormous mechanical construct known as Mecha-Halaster. This 100-tall (30.5 m) metal likeness of Halaster Blackcloak was to be used when Emberosa and the \"Mad Mage\" himself embarked from Undermountain to assail the city of Waterdeep and defeat its colossal protectors.\nMeanwhile, Yargoth the Breaker led an excursion upward into Trobriands Graveyard, in an effort to steal scrap metal from the domains scaladar. When the lesser warlord discovered that the gnome Zox Clammersham possessed a magical ring that controlled the scorpion-like automatons, they began to use rust monsters to distract his metallic minions, murder the gnome, and steal his ring.\n* Doomcrown The leader of the Deaths Head Phalanx was a devout worshiper of Maglubiyet and completely dedicated to the collective goal shared by his war band, their fire giant allies, and the \"Mad Mage\" Halaster.\n* Yargoth the Breaker Another warlord of the Deaths Head, albeit one of lesser rank than Doomcrown, Yargoth was put in charge of the base camp located in the eastern region of the Graveyard.\n* Kurlog This hobgoblin captain led the vanguard tasked with disrupting Zoxs operations and stealing his ring.\n* Jarrk This unfortunate hobgoblin inadvertently set off one of Arcturias polymorph traps and was transformed into a hook horror.\nWhen the fire giant Emberosa led a group of her kin into Arcturiadoom, sometime before the Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR, Doomcrown and the Deaths Head band followed them with complete loyalty. Collectively, the hobgoblins secured most of Arturiadooms halls and chambers, Following that, they set about their shared plan to conquer the north and secure their own Realm on the surface of Faerûn."
