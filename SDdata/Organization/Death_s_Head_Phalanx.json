        "mainbody": "The '''Death's Head Phalanx''' was a band of [[hobgoblin]]s led by the warlord [[Doomcrown]] that settled within [[Undermountain]] during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. They had aligned themselves with the [[fire giant]] [[Emberosa]] and her kin during their plot to conquer [[Waterdeep]] and the [[Northwest Faerûn|the North]] and bring about the rise of the fire giants within the [[Ordning (social structure)|ordning]] of [[giant]] kind.",
        "Activities": "As Doomcrown and his band believed fire giants could sweep over and conquer the surface realms of [[Faerûn]], they set their eventual sights on the [[High Forest]]. The Death's Head warlord believed the fire giants could purge the forest and the Phalanx could seize it as their own domain.\n\nTo this end, the Death's Head Phalanx protected Emberosa and the giants as they worked on creating an enormous mechanical construct known as ''[[Mecha-Halaster]]''. This 100'-tall (30.5 m) metal likeness of [[Halaster Blackcloak]] was to be used when Emberosa and the \"Mad Mage\" himself embarked from Undermountain to assail the city of [[Waterdeep]] and defeat its [[Walking Statues of Waterdeep|colossal protectors]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[Yargoth|Yargoth the Breaker]] led an excursion upward into [[Trobriand's Graveyard]], in an effort to steal scrap metal from the domain's [[scaladar]]. When the lesser warlord discovered that the [[gnome]] [[Zox Clammersham]] possessed a [[magic]]al ring that controlled the scorpion-like automatons, they began to use [[rust monster]]s to distract his metallic minions, murder the gnome, and steal his ring.",
        "Members": "* [[Doomcrown]]: The leader of the Death's Head Phalanx was a devout worshiper of [[Maglubiyet]] and completely dedicated to the collective goal shared by his war band, their fire giant allies, and the \"Mad Mage\" Halaster.\n* [[Yargoth|Yargoth the Breaker]]: Another warlord of the Death's Head, albeit one of lesser rank than Doomcrown, Yargoth was put in charge of the base camp located in the eastern region of the Graveyard.\n* [[Kurlog]]: This hobgoblin captain led the vanguard tasked with disrupting Zox's operations and stealing his ring.\n* [[Jarrk]]: This unfortunate hobgoblin inadvertently set off one of [[Arcturia]]'s ''[[polymorph]]'' traps and was transformed into a [[hook horror]].",
        "History": "When the fire giant Emberosa led a group of her kin into [[Arcturiadoom]], sometime before the [[1492 DR|Year of Three Ships Sailing, 1492 DR]],{{Waterdeep-time}} Doomcrown and the Death's Head band followed them with complete loyalty. Collectively, the hobgoblins secured most of Arturiadoom's halls and chambers, Following that, they set about their shared plan to conquer the north and secure their own Realm on the surface of [[Faerûn]]."
