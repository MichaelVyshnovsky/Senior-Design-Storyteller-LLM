The '''Company of the Singing Dawn''' were a mercenary company based in [[Chondath]] around [[1358 DR]].

==Organization==
The Company was divided into five units: Solara's Elite, fighters from the [[Fields of Nun]]; the Spears of Dawn, fighters; the Forester Guards of Nun, charismatic and chivalrous warriors from the [[Chondalwood]]; the Lightblades, paladins mounted on [[pegasi]]; and the Sunshafts, pegasus-riding [[elven]] archers.

==Contracts==
The Company preferred jobs where they could fight evil. They also did charity work, especially if it involved destroying [[undead]]. They worshiped [[Lathander]] and never did anything that conflicted with the dogma of the Morninglord. They normally charged 1000 [[gold piece]]s per day for their services.

==History==
The Singing Dawn were founded by [[Solara]] around [[1343 DR]] and was first known as Solara's Elite. They were decisive in the battle against the [[arcanaloth]] [[Yrkhetep]].
