The '''Daramos''' were a [[noble]] family from [[Thay]]. They were based in [[Thazalhar]] and [[Pyarados]]. 

==History==
The family was one of the newest noble houses of Thay as of the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The family was based around [[Milsantos Daramos]], the [[Tharchion]] of Thazalhar and a decorated warrior and commander. 

As of {{Yearlink|1357}}, the family comprised Milsantos, his wife, their daughter [[Mantorra Daramos|Mantorra]], and a son.

By {{Yearlink|1370}}, Mantorra had begun using the surname "Hennaflame" to disguise her lineage and to allow her to make her own way in the world. By that time, however, she had already used her family's connections to become an apprentice to [[Aznar Thrul]], the Tharchion of the [[Priador]] and the [[Zulkir]] of [[Evocation]], as well as to join the [[Church of Kossuth|Kossuthan clergy]] at the [[Flaming Brazier]] temple in [[Bezantur]].

==Members==
As Thayvian nobles, the Daramos were among the rulers of Thay. Family members were referred to with the honorifics of "Daeron"/"Daeronness" (literally, "noble-born"), or with "Sir"/"Mistress", "Your Excellency", or "Your Honor".

Notable members of the family included:
* [[Milsantos Daramos]], the Tharchion of Thazalhar.
* [[Mantorra Daramos]], Milsantos's only daughter and a member of the [[Order of Crimson Warlocks]].
