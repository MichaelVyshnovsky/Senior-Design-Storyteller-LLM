        "mainbody": "The '''Many-Starred Cloak''', sometimes called the '''Order of the Many-Starred Cloak''', was a guild of [[arcane magic]] users in the city of [[Neverwinter]] on the [[Sword Coast North]] in the 14{{th}} and late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "The Many-Starred Cloak was known as a band of [[mage]]s who dedicated themselves to Neverwinter and who helped to defend the city and support its rulers with their [[spell]]s. It was widely believed that they were the true power in Neverwinter as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR. During this time, they provided ''[[blastglobes]]'' to the [[Graycloaks of Neverwinter|city's militia]],\n\nThe mages were able to come together to jointly cast and combine great spells that neared the [[epic magic|mighty lost magics]] of [[Myth Drannor]]. They had done this several times, and had once sunk an entire island.",
        "Base of Operations": "The guild's headquarters were found at the [[Cloaktower]] (later written as Cloak Tower), which served as their meeting place and seat of power, and as their fortress when they had to defend themselves. The leadership of the guild briefly moved to an enclave in [[Beorunna's Well]] during the [[Wailing Death]].",
        "Possessions": "Members of the Many-Starred Cloak were, of course, known for their colorful and whimsical [[cloak]]s.\n\nThey were also known to have many [[magic items]] and treasures in their possession, and to seek out and collect powerful and unique [[Netherese]] artifacts, such as the ''[[Ruinstone]]''&mdash;capable of altering reality to undo the wielder's mistakes&mdash;and ''[[Halavar's Universal Pantograph]]''&mdash;a room-sized and highly complex device which could magically duplicate any item placed within it, and which was used only when the need was great for fear that its power could be depleted.",
        "History": "The Many-Starred Cloak was well established in Neverwinter by the 1350s DR. During the latter half of the 14{{th}} century DR, they were considered to be the true rulers of Neverwinter, but were nonetheless strong supporters of Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]] and were active in Neverwinter's defense.\n\nWhen the Spellplague struck in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the Cloaktower was dragged into the [[Far Realm]], taking many of the Many-Starred Cloak mages with it. The Tower itself returned to the city only six months later, but appeared in a different location with no trace of the wizards save for their colorful cloaks&mdash;which would come to life to attack intruders.\n\nThe Order of the Many-Starred Cloak was restored in the late 15{{th}} century DR, and played an important role in Dagult Neverember's efforts to reclaim and rebuild [[Leilon]] by tearing down the magics of the [[High Tower of Thalivar]]. However, the Order also conspired to claim the magic of the Tower for themselves, and placed a powerful mage named [[Gallio Elibro]] in charge of researching and rebuilding the Tower.",
