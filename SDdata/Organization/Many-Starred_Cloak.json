        "mainbody": "The Many-Starred Cloak, sometimes called the Order of the Many-Starred Cloak, was a guild of arcane magic users in the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast North in the 14 and late 15 centuries DR.\nThe Many-Starred Cloak was known as a band of mages who dedicated themselves to Neverwinter and who helped to defend the city and support its rulers with their spells. It was widely believed that they were the true power in Neverwinter as of the mid-to-late 14 century DR. During this time, they provided blastglobes to the citys militia,\nThe mages were able to come together to jointly cast and combine great spells that neared the mighty lost magics of Myth Drannor. They had done this several times, and had once sunk an entire island.\nThe guilds headquarters were found at the Cloaktower (later written as Cloak Tower), which served as their meeting place and seat of power, and as their fortress when they had to defend themselves. The leadership of the guild briefly moved to an enclave in Beorunnas Well during the Wailing Death.\nMembers of the Many-Starred Cloak were, of course, known for their colorful and whimsical cloaks.\nThey were also known to have many magic items and treasures in their possession, and to seek out and collect powerful and unique Netherese artifacts, such as the Ruinstone&mdashcapable of altering reality to undo the wielders mistakes&mdashand Halavars Universal Pantograph&mdasha room-sized and highly complex device which could magically duplicate any item placed within it, and which was used only when the need was great for fear that its power could be depleted.\nThe Many-Starred Cloak was well established in Neverwinter by the 1350s DR. During the latter half of the 14 century DR, they were considered to be the true rulers of Neverwinter, but were nonetheless strong supporters of Lord Nasher Alagondar and were active in Neverwinters defense.\nWhen the Spellplague struck in the , the Cloaktower was dragged into the Far Realm, taking many of the Many-Starred Cloak mages with it. The Tower itself returned to the city only six months later, but appeared in a different location with no trace of the wizards save for their colorful cloaks&mdashwhich would come to life to attack intruders.\nThe Order of the Many-Starred Cloak was restored in the late 15 century DR, and played an important role in Dagult Neverembers efforts to reclaim and rebuild Leilon by tearing down the magics of the High Tower of Thalivar. However, the Order also conspired to claim the magic of the Tower for themselves, and placed a powerful mage named Gallio Elibro in charge of researching and rebuilding the Tower.\nthumb|right|250px|Portraits of past mages in the Cloaktower.As of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Many-Starred Cloak comprised goodly mages, many of whom were secretly Harpers.
