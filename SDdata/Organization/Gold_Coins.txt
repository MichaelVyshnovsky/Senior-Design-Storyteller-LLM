The Gold Coins were a Sembite adventuring company that operated circa 1369 DR.
In the , the Gold Coins attended a party hosted by Lord Partic Thistle at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail. The occasion was King Azoun Obarskyr IVs birthday, and Lord Thistle hoped to improve the standing of adventuring companies in Cormyr by having them present themselves as a gesture of fealty to the King.
When it seemed that Lord Thistle was murdered, the Gold Coins were implicated in it by the Emerald Swords.
