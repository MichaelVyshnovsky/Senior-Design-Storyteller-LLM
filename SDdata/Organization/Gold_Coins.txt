The '''Gold Coins''' were a [[Sembia|Sembite]] [[adventurer|adventuring]] company that operated ''circa'' [[1369 DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Gold Coins attended a party hosted by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]]. The occasion was King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]'s birthday, and Lord Thistle hoped to improve the standing of adventuring companies in Cormyr by having them present themselves as a gesture of fealty to the King.

When it seemed that Lord Thistle was murdered, the Gold Coins were implicated in it by the [[Emerald Swords]].

==Known Gold Coins==
* [[Garit Strongarm]]
* [[Kerit Darkrider]]
