'''House Nightstar''' was a [[moon elf]] house led in [[1367 DR]] by the twin sisters [[Halaema Nightstar]] and [[Saelihn Nightstar]].

==History==
The family moved to [[Evermeet]] after the [[Weeping War|fall of Myth Drannor]]. The house's estate was in [[Leuthilspar]], constructed in a mix of architectural styles and was grown magically from stone and wood. Some members of the house traversed [[Faer√ªn]] in order to gather information for the good of Evermeet. 

==Organization==
The house was one of only two (the other being [[House Ahmaquissar]]) allowed to enter the [[House Hawksong|Hawksong]] house in Leuthilspar. The house symbol was a silver eight-pointed star displayed above doorways.

==Members==
* [[Halaema Nightstar]], twin of Saelihn and shares the leadership of the house in 1367 DR.
* [[Saelihn Nightstar]], twin of Halaema and shares the leadership of the house in 1367 DR.
