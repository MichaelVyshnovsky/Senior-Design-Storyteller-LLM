House Nightstar was a moon elf house led in 1367 DR by the twin sisters Halaema Nightstar and Saelihn Nightstar.
The family moved to Evermeet after the fall of Myth Drannor. The houses estate was in Leuthilspar, constructed in a mix of architectural styles and was grown magically from stone and wood. Some members of the house traversed Faer√ªn in order to gather information for the good of Evermeet. 
The house was one of only two (the other being House Ahmaquissar) allowed to enter the Hawksong house in Leuthilspar. The house symbol was a silver eight-pointed star displayed above doorways.
