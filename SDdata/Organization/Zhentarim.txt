The Zhentarim () also known as the Black Network, was a mercenary company and greater mercantile organization in Faer没n, who, over their 200 years of existence, had a storied history as a cadre of self-serving thieves, spies, assassins, and malevolent wizards, who for a time, were indentured by their leaders to serve dark gods Bane and Cyric. Over the decades, the organization experienced several leaps and bounds in terms of successes, As of 1489 DR the Zhentarim was headquartered in the Western Heartlands, at Darkhold Castle, nestled in the valley of the same name.
As an extension of the will of the dark wizard Manshoon, the Zhentarim was initially formed as a mercenary company to support his rule over the Moonsea with the aim of spreading that control over all of Faer没n. After he recruited the faithful of Bane, unscrupulous merchants and lesser mages to his cause, they collectively sought to dominate all aspects of the Realms, either by manipulation, outright control, or, if they couldnt exert control over something, extinction.
After the mass purge by the Cyricists, known as the Banedeath, and the subsequent partial destruction of Zhentil Keep following the Cyrinishad debacle, the control of the Zhentarim passed to the Bane-worshiping Fzoul Chembryl. He made secret deals with leaders in the Moonsea to erect temples to Iyachtu Xvim, Banes divine son, within the capitals of their city-states. His aim to extend the will of the Lord of Tyrants across Toril was a dynamic factor behind many of the changes within the organization.
By the late 15 century DR, the goals of the Zhentarim returned to their original ideals, despite their more benign public perception. By offering the best guards and mercenaries, with the final aim of an iron-fisted monopoly on protection services in the Realms, they sought to make the merchants of Faer没n, and thus the continental economy, completely reliant upon them as an organization. While many of the practices and services they offered were completely legal, they were not above spending a tremendous amount of gold to destroy their competitors and secure future profits to increase their wealth, influence, and power.
In order to achieve their financial goals, the Zhentarim agents often dealt in illicit goods and contraband, using their extensive mercantile contacts to move products throughout the Moonsea, neighboring lands and over Faer没ns more hazardous terrains. The types of commodities they dealt in were slaves, poison, drugs and even smokepowder weapons.
As a means of eliminating their competition, the Zhentarim used the Zhentilar army of Zhentil Keep or recruited bands of monstrous humanoids to take down rival caravans, often completing the route under their own banner to earn good faith and new business with merchant groups. They were not above resorting to sabotage, blackmail, and arson to outright murder to undermine their mercantile or political opponents. They were even known to purposefully upset the balance of natural beasts, stir up aggressive monster populations within the wild, and even have their mages summon foul monstrosities to threaten isolated towns and villages, in effect forcing the residents to rely on the protection of the Zhentilar.

From the early years of the organization until 1369 DR, the Zhentarim was led by the triumvirate of Manshoon, the ultimate authority and Lord of Zhentil Keep Sememmon, his student in the arcane who presided over Darkhold and Fzoul Chembryl, the High Priest of Bane. However, the Zhentarim was rife with mistrust, even amongst its upper echelons. While Manshoon had a bond of trust with his pupil Sememmon, his relationship with Fzoul was one of mutual disdain shrouded by public respect. While the three shared the same goal of increasing their collective wealth and power, it was at best an uneasy alliance that ultimately fell apart.
In addition to his role as the ultimate authority of the Zhentarim, Manshoon held the title of High Lord of Zhentil keep, speaker of the city-states Council of Lords, and had the full backing of the Zhentilar army. He kept close control over the Moonsea Zhentarim, and controlled the other city states such as Hillsfar, the Citadel of the Raven, and even Mulmaster. Prior to the partial destruction of Zhentil Keep, Manshoon moved his operations over to the Citadel.
The obedient and skillful lieutenant of Manshoon long served as the Lord of Darkhold and unfailingly loyal servant of the Zhentarim. Due to its distance from Manshoon and the Moonsea Zhentarim, the mage-lord only recruited the most loyal and capable agents, about 1000 strong, to the dark keep hidden within the Far Hills. Sememmons second-in-command was the powerful mage Ashemmi, a former Harper, his consort and true love.
Before he became the exarch of Bane following the Spellplague, the faithful servant Fzoul served as the High Priest of his clergy at the Black Altar in Zhentil Keep.
While many on the Council of Lords of Zhentil Keep chose positions of subservience or acquiescence to the Zhentarim, a few of the Keeps Lords were active and proud members of the Zhentarim, including
*Lord Orgauth
*Lady Desmonda
*Lady Alicia The first Lady to sit on the council of Lords showed much promise in the eyes of Manshoon.
*Lord Halaster
*Lord Phandymm This secret worshiper of Bane openly supported Fzoul Chembryl prior to his ascendancy as leader of the Zhentarim and promoted worship of the Black Lord within the Keep.
*Ruinlord Casildar Acting as a second to both Tor Blackflame and Xana the Once-Martyred, the half-elven priest commanded significant power in his coordination with Zhentarim caravan leaders.
*Ruinlord Asdag The cruel priest of Bane served as the de facto ruler of Teshwave, before becoming the head of internal security and head torturer of Zhentil Keep.
Following his ascension during the Time of Troubles, Cyrics followers gained prominence within the Zhentarim. Many of the organizations Banites converted to Cyricism and often had conflicts with those who chose to worship Iyachtu Xvim, Banes divine son.
Meer, the Head of Caravans for the Zhentarim, was overseen by the dark mage Sarthor. He worked with Aghebar who directed individual Zhentarim merchants and Maglor the apothecary. They were served by several caravan masters Ultan Rathelstan, Krommiar Kethyr, Neth Ilturin, Lhemako Taraskh, and (after 1369 DR) Samras Quolcon and Tamek Ilturin.
*Miraun This charming mage served as the "voice" of the Zhentarim, when they were required to parlay and negotiate with foreign heads-of-state.
*Lord General Ulgrym Having proven himself as captain of the Zhentilar under Guthbert Golthammer in Teshwave, Ulgrym eventually became the Captain of Security within Zhentil Keep, and later Commander of the Zhentilar.
*Vrakk
*Kandar Milinal A strict leader and loyal officer, Kandar commanded the Ravenar, the military arm of the Citadel of the Raven.
*Lord Marsh Belwintle The Slave Lord of Zhentil Keep was a powerful and influential merchant.
*Verblen The Keeps chief slaver, who was served by Hastil, Hammon and Jhaven.
*Thagdal Manshoons former apprentice was the head of the Tower of the Art within Zhentil Keep.
*Eregul An ally of Manshoon prior to joining the Zhentarim, Eregul sought to supplant Thagdal and earn a seat in Zhentil Keeps Council of Lords.
While not official members of the Zhentarim, their wide-reaching influence gave them access to political powers, military units, and groups of skilled individuals.
*Naug-adar This cabal of lesser wizards, also known as the "devil dogs", were only granted admittance into the Zhentarim if they demonstrated significant initiative in their duties.
*Naug-orls The thieves guild of Zhentil Keep acted as scouts and reconnaissance agents for the Zhentarim within the Moonsea region. They were led by the master assassin known as Night Fingers.
*Zhentilar The High Lord of Zhentil Keep commanded the city-states military, the Zhentilar. and later General Ulgrym, former captain of security within the Keep.
*Lord Taradril Aumraven led the political and mercantile endeavors under the Lord of Darkhold. The elder wizard believed Sememmon to be a far better leader than Manshoon, as he actually regarded the well-being of the citizens of his realm when making decisions.
Sememmon was served by group of stealthy killers known as the Three Mairhe, Sahbonn, and Itlur.
*Watchful Skull Dhamir Ercals The High Priest of Cyric, who led the Second Banedeath in Darkhold, was granted significant power by Lord Sememmon.
*Malchior This senior cleric of Cyric was served by Strifeleader Dag Zoreth.
Ashemmi had a number of Zhentarim mages serving as her apprentices.
*Yarkul
*Sashen
*Kadorr
*Pereghost The mysterious fallen paladin of Cyric led the military forces of Darkhold under Sememmon and Ashemmi.
*Riviar Darkwind The Pereghosts second-in-command was the commander of the elite force known as the Storm Watch.
*Angus Materi The Captain of the Outriders would regularly patrol the lands surrounding Darkhold, hunting down any Purple Dragons
*Asbarode Also known as "Nith the Entertainer", Asbarode led the Zhentarims network of spies within the Western Heartlands.
After 1370 DR, the Black Network followed a strict linear hierarchy with Fzoul Chembryl serving as the Zhentarims Grand Tyrant. Only the powerful lords would report directly to him, while lesser officers and agents would only report to their immediate superiors.
The only exception to the inherent power structure of the Zhentarim was Manshoon. While he allowed Fzoul to act as the supreme leader of the Zhentarim, he maintained command over any of its agents or resources to further its goals or his own endeavors.
A number of the leaders of the Moonsea city-states either joined the Zhentarim or were otherwise manipulated into serving them
*Rassendyll Uoumdolphin This senior Zhent agent supplanted his twin brother Selfaril Uoumdolphin as the High Blade of Mulmaster and led their branch Zhentarim.
*Teldorn Darkhope The ruler of Mintar was a strong ally of Fzoul Chembryl, having greatly assisted him when Cyricists held great power within the Zhentarim.
*Buorstag Hlammythyl The Bron of Voonlar owed his position to an election that was rigged by the Zhentarim.
*Darik Berkstan This quiet sorcerer was appointed as the leader of the "protectorate" of Y没lash.
*Mara Kalaliv Mara was the leader of the Order of the Iron Gauntlet, an emerging order of Banite monks trained in stealth and assassination.
*Scyllua Darkhope The Zhent noble, and cousin of Teldorn Darkhope of Mintar, ascended to Castellan and Captain of the Guard of Zhentil Keep, reporting directly to Lord Chembryl.
* The beholder Xulla became the Caravan Lord of the Zhentarim.
*Kandar Milinal became the Lord of the Citadel of the Raven. He was served by Cvaal Daoran, leader of the Brothers of the Black Fist.

*Kara Chermosk, a former Zhent soldier who regularly accompanied caravans traversing the Black Road through the Anauroch desert, was promoted to commander of the Tethyamar Fortress.
*Lady Alicia became the head of the Citadel of the Ravens wizards following the destruction of Zhentil Keep.

The Zhentarim had few allies, in comparison to their foes, but they were highly valued for their strategic value. The roster of these supporters were constantly changing along with interests and powers of the Zhentarim. They included
*Beholders Ever since Manshoon first allied himself with Xantriph of the Temple in the Sky, the Zhentarim maintained a mutually beneficial relationship with various beholders across Faer没n, though they maintained their own personal agendas. Xulla, a longtime ally of Fzoul Chembryl, took over this post following Xantriphs death, before becoming the Caravan Lord within the network. Under the assumed name of "Xalval", the elder orb Vaxall of the Twisted Rune was an ally of Teldorn Darkhope and controlled the city of Kzelter. and Zantiid oversaw the Stonelands in Cormyr.
*Bloodswords This Amnian mercenary company drove away Cormyrian patrols and non-Zhent caravans from the region of the High Road west of Eagle Peak in the Storm Horns.
*Harondalbar The black dragon who maintained a lair near the Yellow Snake Pass kept non-Zhentarim forces from the area in return for the treasure, creatures, and adulation brought to him by his "keeper" Faren Starlight.
*Waterdeep Unbeknownst to many, the Zhentarim had a tenuous peace with Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun of Waterdeep during the mid-to-late 1300s DR, thanks to Fzoul Chembryl. Khelben "Blackstaff" exchanged certain information to Fzoul in exchange for an assurance that the Black Network would not expand their influence west of the Thunder Peaks for 30 years. This bargain led to a split between the Harpers and Khelbens independently operating Moonstars.
Over the years, the Zhentarim drew the ire and hostility of a great number of peoples and organizations. They opposed any group they perceived as a threat to their interests to grow their trade and influence across Faer没n, including the Iron Throne of the Sword Coast, the Rundeen of Calimshan, and the fanatical Cult of the Dragon. They included
*Harpers Due to their diametrically opposed world views, the Harpers were at odds with the Zhentarim ever since they became aware of the networks existence. Many of the highest-ranking members of the Harpers, such as Elminster Aumar, and several of the Seven Sisters had sizable bounties placed upon their heads by the Black Network.
*Knights of the North This group of resistance fighters was formed in 1355 DR after Zhentil Keep betrayed the allied forces of the Moonsea by violently seizing the Citadel of the Raven. Following the death of Commander Galauntar Hawkhelm, his fellow Ravenar soldiers banded together and launched a guerrilla campaign against Zhent holdings and Zhentarim operations within the Moonsea.
*Iron Throne
*Cult of the Dragon
*Rundeen
*Red Wizards of Thay

The Zhentarim was founded in the , by the power-hungry wizard Manshoon, the lord of Zhentil Keep, as a tool for his ambitions of expanding his realm of control. He was soon joined by the Banite cleric Fzoul Chembryl in the , who broke away from the orthodox church in Mulmaster, bringing with him a small army of his fellow priests into the lesser ranks of the Zhentarim. He then disposed of the high-ranking priests within Zhentil Keep and converted the citys lesser clergy to the worship of Bane. Paranoid even in the early years of their alliance, Manshoon offset the possible threat of Fzouls influence by concocting a plan with the beholder Xantriph. They had the Banite priests confess their sins and swear fealty to Manshoon alone. Xantriphs lair, the floating Temple in the Sky, became an outpost for Zhentilar troops and Banite priests in former Teshendale.
Manshoon planned on capturing the Citadel of the Raven during the first days of the Zhentarim, though they were not powerful enough as an organization to openly attack a city of the Moonsea. While it was openly discussed for years, many senior members of the Zhentarim advocated against assaulting the city, fearful of losing their investments that funded the Black Network. 
In the , Manshoon seized the fortress of Darkhold from the Lich-Queen Varalla in order to extend his control into the Western Heartlands. Four years later, they invaded and seized Teshendale in the .
They then conquered and installed their own rulers in Daggerdale in 1336 DR. Manshoon consolidated his rule over all Zhent lands and declared himself the High Lord of Zhentil Keep the following year. These actions caused the nations of the Moonsea to grow wary of the Zhentarim and Zhentil Keep.
Also that year, Manshoon granted the previously occupied Y没lash its independence, and maneuvered this act of "good will" to call a meeting of the rulers of the Moonsea in the neutral town of Elmwood. He called for a garrison to be established at the Citadel of the Raven to protect the greater Moonsea from a horde of orcs that was stirring further north. He "graciously" offered to move the recently evicted Zhentilar soldiers from Y没lash to the city, though this was merely part of a long-term scheme to take over the city.
The Zhentarim saw significant losses in the next few years when Jyordhan, puppet ruler of Shadowdale, was assassinated by Khelben Arunsun Xantriph was killed by the Knights of Myth Drannor and Malyk, the puppet ruler of Daggerdale, was killed by Randal Morn, leading to all-out civil war.
Despite their losses, the time was right in the  for the Zhentarim to strike against their former allies in the Citadel of the Raven. They had their agents planted within the city kill as many as they could, using poison and magic. The orcs and Zhentilar poured into the city and claimed it for the Zhentarim. One of the few survivors within the Citadel was the mortally wounded Galauntar Hawkhelm, whose eventual death would lead to the formation of the Knights of the North.
During the Time of Troubles of the , Bane arrived in the Black Altar. He ordered his devoted priest Fzoul Chembryl and Manshoons apprentice Sememmon to work together, much to their mutual displeasure, in an assault on the Twisted Tower of Ashaba in Shadowdale so that he could enter Morningdawn Hall. After the destruction of the Dark Gods avatar, the newly ascended deity Cyric, who took on his divine portfolio, became the focus of worship for a great number of the members of the Zhentarim. Fzoul Chembryl and a few others maintained their faith, while some others converted to the veneration of Iyachtu Xvim, Banes divine son.
In the , the Zhentarim began their campaign to take control of a trade route that ran through the desert of Anauroch. They were initially rebuffed by the unified tribes of the Bedine, aided by the Harper agent Lander and an exiled sorceress known as Ruha.
The conflict between the opposing faiths embedded within the Zhentarim culminated in an event known as the Banedeath, which began on Marpenoth 30, the . Xeno Mirrormane, Manshoon realized that Cyric was no replacement for the calculating cunning and patience of Bane. 
Over a period of six months in the , Manshoon quietly and discreetly shifted resources and personnel from Zhentil Keep to the Citadel of the Raven, being distrustful of the impulsive Cyric and his inept clergy members. Fzoul Chembryl saw these actions and remained neutral, still bitter from his loss of influence as the High Priest of Bane.
Cyric was eventually undermined by a divine conspiracy involving High Lord Fzoul. The larger northern half of Zhentil Keep was left in ruins as a result. Some 1,500 Zhentilar and Zhentarim, many of whom were high-ranking officers, and all the orc troops fled the city.
In the , Fzoul and Lord Orgauth attacked and killed Manshoon. However, Manshoon lived on through clone bodies, many of whom fought and killed each other. Of these, one returned to the Zhentarim, conceded all leadership to Fzoul, and worked as an agent.

Bane was resurrected on Midwinter night in the .
In the early morning hours of Nightal 16, the , a Zhentarim army led by Scyllua Darkhope overran Shadowdale from the north. They were aided by the church of Shar and House Dhuurniv, who attacked the Twisted Tower from below. The Army of Myth Drannor was unable to respond as Zhentarim brigades to the east launched simultaneous attacks on several key elven fortifications.
A Zhent named Karne attempted to take over the Onyx Tower, but the plan ultimately failed.
In the Year of the Vindicated Warrior, 1383 DR, the Shadovar moved against Zhentil Keep during the Shadowbane War, razing it along with the Citadel of the Raven, killing both Fzoul and the final clone of Manshoon, leaving only Darkhold left.

The Zhentarim was again taken over by the forces of Cyric, who engaged in battle with the forces of Bane. In the , an evil mage named Rezlus took over the Banites and attempted to conquer Daggerdale. He failed and the Banites fell with only the forces of Cyric remaining. 
Under the leadership of the Pereghost, the Zhentarim transitioned from a conquering force into a mercenary army that served others. As of 1489 DR, the Zhentarim were said to have greater numbers than ever before and had a reputation for service unlike any time in their history.

In the , the Zhentarim sent an agent, the gnome assassin Jamna Gleamsilver, to investigate the recent activities of the Cult of the Dragon, as they had been growing in power rather rapidly. They allied with several other factions, including those which would otherwise be enemies, to rise up against the Cult and Red Wizards attempts to free the dragon god Tiamat. 
*Zhentil Keep This city-fortress was the main base of operation for the Zhentarim.
*Citadel of the Raven This isolated stronghold was a chain of interconnected fortresses straddling the Dragonspine Mountains. It was intended to stop any possible invasions from either The Ride or Thar. The Zhentarim stole it from the other Moonsea powers in 1355 DR, some fifteen years before Manshoon made it the stronghold from which he would pursue his arcane interests.
*Melvaunt Seemingly always at war with Zhentil Keep, Melvaunt was infiltrated by agents of the Zhentarim, in an attempt to take over their slave trade,
*Mulmaster This former enemy became an ally to the Zhentarim after the High Blade was secretly replaced by his twin brother in 1368 DR.
*Phlan Another long-time foe, the settlement was finally conquered in 1380 DR.
*Y没lash The Zhentarim took this city in a long and bloody civil war, where they pitted their forces against those of Hillsfar.

*Darkhold The castle-keep of Darkhold and the surrounding Far Hills were conquered by the Zhentarim in 1312 DR. In the following century, following the Spellplague, Darkhold would serve as headquarters for the restructured Zhentarim, led by the Pereghost.
*Daggerdale In 1336 DR, Zhentarim agents infiltrated Daggerdale and wrested control of Dagger Falls out of the rightful governments hands, and Randal Morn was forced to flee the city. The Zhentarim ruled the city for 33 years, though they were forced to regularly rebuff attacks from the Freedom Riders in a bloody civil war. Randal Morn and his guerrillas eventually reclaimed their lands in the battle for Dagger Falls.
*Scardale In a joint venture with Cormyr, Sembia, and the other Dalelands states, the Zhentarim sponsored a peacekeeping force in Scardale after Lashan Aumersair attempted to conquer the area during the second inter-dale war. Support for the troops was withdrawn soon after they arrived in 1357 DR though they remained in the Dale for at least another decade.
*Shadowdale In the late 1330s DR, the Zhentarim managed to assassinate the lord of Shadowdale, Aumry Obarskyr, and replace him with one of their agents, Jyordhan, who ruled over the Dale for six years, until he was killed by Khelben Arunsun. It was only a few months before the citizens of Shadowdale, led by Azalar Falconhand and his fey allies, overthrew the occupiers.
*Teshendale In 1316 DR, Zhentil Keep recruited a horde of orcs to overrun Teshendale and seized the city shortly after.
*Anauroch The Zhentarim built the Black Road across Anauroch to allow trade with the North, including Waterdeep. They had control of a number of oases within the sands of the unforgiving desert, including Bhaerlith, Maatar, Olomaa
*Chult The Zhentarim forged a strong relationship with the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru, notably with Ifan Talroa and Zhanthi, and their mercenaries provided security for the city walls, mining and lumber activities, and even the princes villas. Their chief covert operative was one of the citys so-called "beggar princes" known as Pock-Marked Po. Circa 1490 DR, Zhent operatives had come to the region to hunt for Artus Cimber.
*Icewind Dale In the late 1480s DR, a Zhentarim agent from Luskan named Naerth Maxildanarr became Speaker of Targos and thus gained a prominent position in the Ten-Towns. He was eager to secure a Zhentarim stranglehold on northern trade to and from Icewind Dale.
*Savage Frontier In the Delimbiyr Vale, the town of Llorkh and the village of Orlbar were taken over by the Zhentarim. These settlements marked the terminus of the Black Road route and the gateway for Zhent trade in the North.
*Sword Coast Through Karne, the Zhentarim were a shadowy organization that existed in Baldurs Gate and its surrounding areas. The Marsh of Chelimber was conquered by the Zhentarim through Karne and his lizardfolk servant, Sleyvas.
*Zhent A person from Zhentil Keep. Not all Zhents were members of the Zhentarim.
*Zhentarim The greater organization itself members of the organization, either singular or plural.
*Zhentilar The military of Zhentil Keep, used to distinguish them from members of the Zhentarim.
