        "mainbody": "'''The Companions of the Hall''' was the name for the group of adventurers who retook and subsequently defended [[Mithral Hall]]. They consisted of King [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and his companion [[Guenhwyvar]], and [[Catti-brie]], [[Wulfgar]], and [[Regis]].",
        "History": "As of [[1372 DR]], Bruenor, having discovered that what he thought was [[Gauntlgrym]] was actually the ruins of [[Baffenburg]], led political overtures with the fledgling kingdom of [[Many-Arrows]].\n\nWulfgar then left the group, returning to [[Icewind Dale]] to rejoin the [[Tribe of the Elk]]. Catti-brie gave up the life of the warrior and embraced tutelage from [[Alustriel]] in [[the Art]].\n\nIn [[1385 DR]], at the beginning of the [[Spellplague]], Catti-brie was struck by [[blue fire]] during her meditations and got caught between two planes of existence: the [[Shadowfell]] and the [[Prime Material Plane]]. Drizzt took her to Mithral Hall where eventually Bruenor and Drizzt took her to [[Cadderly Bonaduce]], with the help of [[Jarlaxle]], through a disguised [[Athrogate]]. Drizzt, Bruenor, Jarlaxle, and Athrogate teamed up and helped her get to [[Spirit Soaring]]. Once they arrived, they faced the threat of a [[dracolich]] calling itself the [[Ghost King]], which was, in fact, a manifestation of the dragon [[Hephaestus]], combined with an [[illithid]] and [[Crenshinibon]], the Crystal Shard. Finding the dracolich too powerful, Cadderly sacrificed himself to ward the Ghost King away from the Prime Material Plane forever, but was never fully able to help Catti-brie. Catti-brie eventually died days later in Mithral Hall. With one last goodbye to Drizzt, Mielikki took her away to a [[Iruladoon|private heaven]] that had been prepared for her and Regis, who was similarly sick from trying to save her with his [[ruby pendant]], to spend the rest of eternity dancing, completely happy. When Wulfgar died, he too joined them, and fishermen in Icewind Dale reported seeing the three on occasion.<ref>\n\nBruenor spent the last years of his life searching tirelessly for Gauntlgrym with [[Drizzt]], eventually finding it with the help of Jarlaxle and Athrogate. He was infused with the power of ancient [[dwarven]] kings before his end, which allowed him to go out in a blaze of glory, defeating a [[pit fiend]] and saving the [[Sword Coast North]] from complete destruction. Before both he and [[Thibbledorf Pwent]] died of their battle wounds, Bruenor went to live with his children and closest friend in Mielikki's heaven, but Drizzt, still a young man by [[drow]] standards, had to forge new alliances and live the rest of his life without his family until the Companions were reincarnated by [[Mielikki]].\n\nOne of the most memorable accomplishments of the Companions was immortalized in [[Garumn's Gorge]]. A statue of Bruenor riding the dragon [[Shimmergloom]] to its death was sculpted just in time for the signing of the [[Treaty of Garumn's Gorge]]."
