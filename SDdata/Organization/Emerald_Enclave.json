        "mainbody": "Based out of the isle of Ilighôn, the Emerald Enclave's heart was the House of Silvanus, or Oakenhall, built atop the mountain range at the center of the island. By the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Emerald Enclave had expanded its scope beyond the Vilhon Reach to the rest of Faerûn. To protect forests that would surely eventually face danger from encroaching civilization, it formed splinter cells in such woods as [[High Forest]], [[Cormanthor]], the [[Wealdath]], and the [[Great Dale]]. Despite the cells' humble sizes, they remained vigilant, keeping watch for foes such as the [[Church of Talos]] and the [[People of the Black Blood]].

        "Beliefs": "[[File:Emerald_Enclave.JPG|thumb|''The 14{{th}} century symbol of the Emerald Enclave.'']]\nAccording to the Elder Circle, the Greatest Tenets Number Three included:\n* The order of nature must be preserved in all its iterations.\n* Any force that would disrupt that order had to be defeated.\n* The Enclave would always provide aid to anyone left fatigued or suffering injury.",
        "Organization": {
            "Ranks": "The Enclave had the following ranks from lowest to highest: Springwarden, Summerstrider, Autumnreaver, Winterstalker, and Master of the Wild.",
            "Hierarchy": "The Enclave arranged into seven 'circles', which each had different duties and a different place in the hierarchy. Each member of the organization belonged to a single circle and could move between them with experience and by reaching certain prominence within the order. These circles were began with the [[Circle of Initiates]], aptly named for including new members of the Enclave. The [[Circle of Earth]], the second circle of prominence, welcomed members of the Circle of Initiates as they ranked up. The third in the hierarchy was the [[Circle of Air]], which usually had its members join after learning the ability to take on a ''[[wild shape]]''. Non-druids were promoted to the Circle of Air after performing outstanding service for the Enclave. From the Circle of Air, members of the organization could move to one of three groups: [[Eldath's Circle]], the [[Circle of Alluvium]], and the [[Planar Circle]].\n\nEldath's Circle did not necessarily mean worshiping the goddess of calm waters, but all of its members took on the role of sailing and protecting the waterways of [[Toril]]. They searched for information beneficial to the Emerald Enclave in the process. The Planar Circle was the group of individuals whose calling laid beyond the [[Prime Material plane]]—the most respected of all roles within the organization, many of whom perished in the planes or elected never to return to [[Toril]], but continued to send information from the planes to the Emerald Enclave. Lastly, the members of the Circle of Earth were travelers. They crossed the entirety of [[Faerûn]], while some stuck to traversing the Vilhon Reach. The circle's members served as scouts and spies, keeping tabs on kingdoms, organizations, and politics that could interfere with the natural balance.\n\nThe [[Elder Circle]], or the Elder Circle of Three, was the governing body of the Emerald Enclave and the highest circle one could be promoted to. The circle consisted of only three members at one time. Members of the Circle of Three were the most powerful druids or religious leaders, and with such fame came [[pilgrim]]s searching for the Elder Circle's wise advice and those seeking to end the Emerald Enclave, starting with its leaders."
        },
        "Dogma": "The majority of members venerated [[Eldath]], the Goddess of Singing Waters; [[Mielikki]], Lady of the Forest; or [[Silvanus]], the Treefather.",
        "Activities": {
            "Abilities": "All members of the Enclave were taught a unique language, \"[[druidspeak]]\", that had some similarities to [[thieves' cant]]. \"Druidspeak\" was never taught to outsiders. It usually took a year or more to learn.\n\nMembers of the Elder Circle received magical divine gifts from the patron gods of the Emerald Enclave. They became hidden from magical sight; were under the constant effects of the ''[[nondetection]]'' [[spell]]; became unaffected by any charm, indoctrination, and mind control; and were immune to all mundane and magical [[disease]]s and afflictions such as [[lycanthropy]]. Lastly, the Elders received the gift of a dramatically slowed aging process, aging only a year per decade. Similarly, they only needed to sleep one night out of ten. Additionally, they also received a special gift from the deity they worshiped. Eldathyn Elders could breathe underwater and transport themselves to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]] at will, Mielikki's faithful could shapechange into [[treant]]s and heal when transforming back, and Silvanites could ''[[meld into stone]]'' and travel to the [[Elemental Plane of Earth]] at will.\n\nThose members of the Emerald Enclave who sought to master wilderness survival, reportedly traveled to the isle of [[Wavecrest]], neighboring the isle of Ilighôn. The island was known for its untamed jungles full of mysteries and danger. However, the Enclave did not share its knowledge of the island with outsiders.\n\nThose divine spellcasters of the Emerald Enclave who worshiped Silvanus, Mielikki, and Eldath gained access to several unique spells. These spells included ''[[faith-magic zone]]'', the same magics that sheltered Ilighôn, which was a gift from [[Mystra]] to Silvanus. The spell called ''[[re-target]]'' allowed the caster to redirect any spell, friendly or not, within its range. And lastly there was the spell of ''[[windlance]]'' that launched the caster and any creature within its vicinity high into the air.",
            "Initiation": "Initiates were required to serve neither good nor evil, nor to serve any other organization (apart from the churches of Eldath, Mielikki, or Silvanus), to be innocent of crimes against nature, and to have performed at least one significant deed that benefited nature in the Vilhon Reach. The rites of initiation were held each full moon at the [[Oakenhall]], which was the House of Silvanus at the heart of Ilighôn."
        },
        "Tactics": "The Emerald Enclave had a well-established pattern of action when dealing with those violating nature. Firstly, the Enclave issued a simple warning to those deemed guilty. If the warning was ignored, the Emerald Enclave acted swiftly and decisively, stopping the wrongdoers by any means.",

        "Possessions": "Members of the Emerald Enclave did not wear uniforms; instead, each individual was adorned with an article of clothing or jewelry that was green in color. Most commonly, it was a green pendant or a pair of [[emerald]] earrings. Druids of high standing could be discerned by their eyes that turned a bright green color and shimmered with Silvanus's ''[[holy symbol]]''.",
        "Relationships": "The Emerald Enclave was at odds with the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] for many, many years and with mages of the [[Zhentarim]], as well as other wizards, in fears of the spellcasters abusing [[the Art]] and unleashing a disaster similar to the Rotting Wars. The Enclave also opposed the [[Church of Bane]], [[Church of Talos]], and [[Church of Malar]], as well as the Malarite cult known as the [[People of the Black Blood]].\n\nThe only settlement on the isle of Ilighôn, [[Sapra]], was granted only limited land by the Emerald Enclave, stopping its growth and overpopulation. The port town's existence fully depended on the Emerald Enclave's goodwill. The cities of the Vilhon Reach operated their logging industries with the Enclave's permission. The city of [[Hlath]]'s main export was lumber, with its industry carefully monitored. The metropolis of [[Reth]]'s logging was being phased out as of 1372 DR after years of tensions between it and the Emerald Enclave. The Turmishan city of [[Gildenglade]], before its destruction, was on good terms with the Enclave thanks to its elven population who handled negotiations, forestry, and forest preservation. [[Lizardmen]] of [[Surkh]], the City of Lizards, maintained cordial relationships with the Emerald Enclave.\n\nThe Emerald Enclave served as protectors for creatures dwelling on the Shining Plains. As such, the Enclave's representatives attended the annual memorial on the [[Hill of Memories]], commiserating the tragedy of the [[Field of Tears]] of the {{YearlinkName|326}}. Following the memorial, the gathered leaders discussed any issues that had arisen in the last year. The most powerful clan of the Shining Plains, the [[Ten-paw]], counted a representative of the Emerald Enclave as one of its close advisors, who lived with the [[wemic]] clan.",
        "History": {
            "Founding": "Many considered the {{YearlinkName|374}} to be the year when the Emerald Enclave was established. However, that was not entirely true, as that was the year when the Church of Silvanus built a shrine to their deity during a ceremony on [[Midsummer Night]]. The shrine was known as Oakenhome, or the House of Silvanus, on the isle of Ilighôn. It initially was a small druidic conclave for those who mastered ''[[shapechange|shapechanging]]'' and was able to reach the island in the shape of a [[bird]]. The actual temple's construction was finished just a few years later.\n\nThe nation of Turmish start conflicting with the Enclave as early as the {{YearlinkName|552}}, but the first event that established the Emerald Enclave as the power to be reckoned with was its full-blown battle with Turmish and its leaders at the time, [[the Windlass]]. They sent an army to the druidic sanctuary of [[Cedarsproke]] in the Gulthmere Forest and a war fleet to Ilighôn in the {{YearlinkName|717}}. The troops were ambushed passing through the [[Orsraun Mountains]] by [[giant]] allies of the Enclave, while [[water elemental]]s who served the druids vanquished the Turmishan fleet. This monumental loss cost the members of the Windlass their heads and allowed the Emerald Enclave to expand its presence to the forests of Chondalwood and Winterwood.\n\nThe Enclave's initial goal was to protect the interests and natural resources within the Vilhon Reach in the face of despoilers of nature. One such despoiler was a [[mohrg]] warlord servant of Malar, [[Borran Klosk]], who led an [[undead]] army in the Vilhon Reach in the {{YearlinkName|1150}}. The Emerald Enclave allied with the [[dwarves]] of [[Alaoreum]] and partook in the [[Battle of Morningstar Hollows]] where the Enclave's druids flooded the [[Alaoreum River]], washing away Borran Klosk's undead. The creature itself survived and was imprisoned by the Church of Eldath under the city of [[Alaghôn]] in the [[Temple of the Trembling Flower]]. The same year, Turmish, under the leadership of [[Saros|Lord Saros]], entered tough negotiations with the Enclave, electing to avoid open war over the nation's booming population. As a gesture of good will, druids of the Emerald Enclave offered magical protection to Turmishan cities against the [[plague]]s and afflictions that ravaged the Vilhon Reach at the time.\n\nNot long after the creation of Turmish's [[Assembly of Stars]] in the [[1248 DR|Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR]], the town of [[Ironcloak]] in Turmish was granted logging rights, despite some members of the Assembly of Stars' protests. Lord [[Ironcloak (lord)|Ironcloak]] started cutting down trees recklessly and filling the [[Alaoreum River]] with industrial waste. The Emerald Enclave issued a stern warning to Ironcloak that went unheeded. A single Enclave druid arrived at Ironcloak with an order to cease and desist and was promptly murdered by the Lord's men. Two days later, the druids delivered their final warning, attached to numerous arrows, declaring the town would be destroyed at dawn. Lord Ironcloak mocked their threats and sent his people into the forest. Enclave's [[earth elemental]]s emerged from the forest floor and began killing every person they found. Lord Ironcloak joined the battle, but then the river itself flooded its banks and inundated the town, wiping away buildings and people, the lord, and his fortune.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1344}}, the Emerald Enclave clashed with the nation of [[Sespech]] when government-sponsored lumberjacks entered Chondalwood, believing its elven population left in the [[Retreat]]. They were met with a volley of arrows unleashed by the Enclave and its allies. Sespechian foragers entered the forest from the west but, luckily, were turned away after meeting the Enclave's druids, with no blood spilled this time.\n\nDuring the [[Time of Troubles]] of the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, when gods walked on Toril, Malar's avatar personally entered the [[Gulthmere Forest]] to destroy the members of the Emerald Enclave there. The avatar of [[Nobanion]] stood against the avatar of Malar alongside the Emerald Enclave. Their clash resulted in Malar's defeat and the removal of the Beastlord's cult from the region for some time.\n\nThe same year as gods walked Toril, citizens of the city of Gildenglade became concerned by the increased volcanic activity of [[Mount Kolimnis]]. The wizard [[Danirro of Alaghôn]] was hired by the city to stop the volcano's inevitable eruption. In the summer of {{YearlinkName|1360}}, Danirro discovered magics to stop the eruption. He scaled Mount Kolimnis to perform the ritual as agents of the Emerald Enclave emerged from hiding and pushed him into the volcano's gaping mouth. The wizard was unlucky enough to be wearing a ''[[ring of feather falling]]'', so he slowly roasted on his way down before being disintegrated by lava. Danirro's laboratory was destroyed by a fire at the time of his death, and all records of the spell were lost. Following the wizard's disappearance, Gildenglade received a grim warning from the Emerald Enclave not to meddle with the forces they did not understand. Mount Kolimnis continued spewing heated steam, but its eruption was not to come for another century.\n\nMohrg warlord Borran Klosk was freed in the {{YearlinkName|1370}} and once again threatened the Vilhon Reach. His new undead army of [[drowned one]]s from the [[Whamite Isles]] sought to activate the legendary ''[[Taraketh's Hive]]'' that could devastate the natural order in Turmish for many centuries to come. The undead plot was stopped by a druid of the Emerald Enclave, [[Haarn Brightoak]].\n\nAround the same year, the Whamite Isles in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] fell to an epidemic of mass suicides caused by some unknown magics. For some, possibly related reason, the Emerald Enclave sent several ships to the nine-island cluster. The Enclave avoided the magical dangers of the islands and claimed them for the organization.",
            "Post-Spellplague": "After the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] drained, joining the isle of Ilighôn with the mainland and part of the nation of Turmish. This change resulted in the organization becoming perverted and xenophobic, bent on destroying all forms and manifestations of the Spellplague. Much of the order died or left for [[Gulthandor]]. The remaining druids, led by the increasingly mad [[Cindermoon]], formerly known as Shadowmoon Crystalembers, were less capable and experienced and harbored a deep hatred of the [[Spellscar|spellscarred]]. Several agents were sent to the [[plaguelands]] south of Turmish, and the organization also tried to stop the scar [[pilgrim]]ages that passed through, usually by violent means.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1423}}, Mount Kolimnis finally erupted, as it was left untamed thanks to the Emerald Enclave. Gildenglade and its 50,000 inhabitants were buried under several hundred feet of ash and hot mud.",
            "The Second Sundering": "The Enclave was revitalized in the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, when the Chosen of [[Lathander]], [[Stedd Whitehorn]], cured Cindermoon of a [[Shar]]-induced madness and the [[Great Rains]] refilled the Sea of Fallen Stars.\n\nAlong with other factions, the Enclave rose up to oppose a plot by the [[Cult of the Dragon]] to return [[Tiamat]] to the mortal realm.<ref>"
