'''Eltorchul Academy''' was an arcane academy founded by the noble family [[Eltorchul|of the same name]] and housed at [[Eltorchul Villa|their villa]] in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].  

==History==
Its founder, Lord [[Thesp Eltorchul]], invested the family's [[spices|spice]] and import fortune into the academy, along with the acquisition of rare magical components.

The academy was originally only open to nobles and children of means, but the school and family fell on hard times when Lord Thesp's son, [[Oth Eltorchul]], was left incapacitated by a failed magical experiment into the creation of ''[[dream sphere]]s'' in {{Yearlink|1368}}. Since then, Eltorchul Academy was open to almost any student who had the money to pay for tuition, including many [[elves]], [[half-elves]], and [[halfling]]s. That led to a plummet in the academy's social standing by {{Yearlink|1372}}.

==Members==
The two leaders of the academy were Lord Thesp Eltorchul and his daughter, [[Fea Eltorchul]].

[[Danilo Thann]] was known to have been a student for a time.
