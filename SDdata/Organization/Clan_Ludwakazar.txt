'''Clan Ludwakazar''' ({{Pronounce|Lud|WAK|ah|zah|refs={{Cite adventurers league/Mayhem in the Earthspur Mines|36}}}}) was a [[dwarven]] clan that dwelled deep in the [[Earthspur Mountains]] in [[Impiltur]].

Some believed that the Ludwakazar dwarves had an [[Elemental Plane of Earth|elemental earth]] bloodline from some unknown source. The dwarves were silent on the issue.
