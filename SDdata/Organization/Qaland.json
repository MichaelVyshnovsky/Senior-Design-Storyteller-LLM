        "mainbody": "The '''Qaland''' or '''Qajand''' family was the reigning dynasty of the [[Igidujin]] tribe and the city of [[Quaraqand]] in the [[Chigidi Mountains]] in the [[Plain of Horses]].<ref group=\"note\">The source uses both \"Qajand\" (p. 81, two mentions) and \"Qaland\" (p. 86, three mentions). The wiki adopts \"Qaland\" as it is more common and is used in character names.",
        "History": "The pitiless [[Qaland Shurijah]] united the ''hsing'' (clans) of the [[Chigidi Mountains]], after almost a century of deadly warring with one another, and forged the Igidujin tribe. The Qaland family ruled the Igidujin ever since.\n\n''Circa'' {{YearlinkConvert|2607|SY}}, Shurijah's descendant, [[Qaland T'akk]], reigned over the Igidujin and the city of [[Quaraqand]]. He was a man without mercy and bent on conquest.",
        "Description": "Their reign was a cruel and despotic one. Under the vicious law of the Qalands, thieves and protestors were executed, no trial necessary. However, the most common crime in Quaraqand was apparently treason, and resulted in the alleged traitor, their family, and even their livestock all being slain. Furthermore, Qaland T'akk forced those who served him to kill enemies according to weekly quotas. Failure to kill enough was of course punished by execution, by T'akk himself."
