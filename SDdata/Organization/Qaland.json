        "mainbody": "The Qaland or Qajand family was the reigning dynasty of the Igidujin tribe and the city of Quaraqand in the Chigidi Mountains in the Plain of Horses.The source uses both \"Qajand\" (p. 81, two mentions) and \"Qaland\" (p. 86, three mentions). The wiki adopts \"Qaland\" as it is more common and is used in character names.\nThe pitiless Qaland Shurijah united the hsing (clans) of the Chigidi Mountains, after almost a century of deadly warring with one another, and forged the Igidujin tribe. The Qaland family ruled the Igidujin ever since.\nCirca , Shurijahs descendant, Qaland Takk, reigned over the Igidujin and the city of Quaraqand. He was a man without mercy and bent on conquest.\nTheir reign was a cruel and despotic one. Under the vicious law of the Qalands, thieves and protestors were executed, no trial necessary. However, the most common crime in Quaraqand was apparently treason, and resulted in the alleged traitor, their family, and even their livestock all being slain. Furthermore, Qaland Takk forced those who served him to kill enemies according to weekly quotas. Failure to kill enough was of course punished by execution, by Takk himself."
