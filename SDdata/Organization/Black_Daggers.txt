The '''Black Daggers''' were a pirate [[guild]] based in the [[Nelanther Isles]] in the [[Sea of Swords]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/68/The Everwinking Eye: Goodbye, Mulmaster|28}}

==History==
Only recently formed in the 1360s [[DR]], the Black Daggers graciously declared that ships of [[Waterdeep]] were off-limits to its members, though this of course did not apply to non-members, so Waterdhavian vessels were only at reduced risk of attack around the Nelanther. Regardless, this amnesty was in thanks for [[Mirt the Merciless]] destroying the ''[[The Black Basilisk]]'', a pirate-hunter from [[Luskan]] crewed by [[Hosttower]] mages, and scattering their Dead Fleet.
