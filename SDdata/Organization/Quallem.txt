The '''Quallem''' family was a noble family of [[Dordrien]] in the area that later became [[Daggerdale]].

==Organization==
The head of the family was recognized to be [[Lady Quallem]].

==Base of operations==
As a noble family of [[Dordrien]], the Quallem family resided near [[Dordrien Keep]] in the [[Dagger Hills]]. The Quallem family's status among the nobles of Dordrien was significant enough for it to have a sizable crypt set aside for it only a few miles north of Dordrien Keep.

==History==
Sometime after the fall of [[Jhaamdath]] in {{Yearlink|-255}}, a [[Jhaamdath]]an noble, [[Dordrien (person)|Dordrien]], founded a small enclave of survivors on the western slopes of the Dagger Hills. Although the realm lasted little more than a century before [[orc]] attacks spelled its demise, in that time the Quallem family managed to rise to a point of prominence that meant they were honored with a place in the [[Dordrien|Dordrien Crypts]].

During [[Lady Quallem]]'s time as the head of the family, she had a son with some degree of skill as a [[wizard]]. Both of them were interred in the family vault. However, Lady Quallem herself could not rest easy while her last descendant's body was not buried in the family tomb. Therefore she rose as a [[ghost]] and remained shackled to the family crypt, even as late as [[1372 DR]].
