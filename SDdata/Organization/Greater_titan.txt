The '''Greater Titans''', sometimes referred to simply as '''the Titans''' or the '''elder gods''', were a powerful group of [[deities]] that once dominated much of the [[plane]] of [[Arborea]], until they were overthrown by the [[Olympian pantheon]] and imprisoned in the bowels of [[Carceri]].<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|2}}

According to some they were [[greater deities]], to others they were merely [[intermediate deities]], and still others claimed they altogether weren't quite deities, being sort of [[Quasi-deity|quasi-deities]]<ref> with power comparable to the other deities that dwelled in Carceri.

==Organization==
The Titans of Carceri were ruled despotically by their sibling Cronus. He ruled them with an iron fist and constantly reminded his siblings that it was only by his hand that they ever ruled Arborea. Because of his despotism, not all of the Titans were supportive of Cronus's rule,

The other Titans resented having to come to his beck-and-call, often storming off from conversations with him in a destructive huff. They spoke in private of one day revolting against Cronus and laying him low, but would bide their time until that day came. Cronus in turn was constantly paranoid of his siblings plotting against him and kept a close eye on them all.

==Activities==
Much of existence for the greater titans was filled with plotting their revenge against the Olympians<ref> and searching for ways to escape their imprisonment. Sometimes they would seize upon people traveling through Carceri in hopes that they might possess some form of abilities, knowledge, or items that could aid them in their plans.

Unlike the Olympians, whenever they were slighted the Titans usually didn't send people on tasks for repentance. Instead they went straight to exacting vengeance.

==Base of Operations==
Prior to their downfall the Titans all lived on the plane of Arborea and, if the Olympians were to be believed, the first deities to inhabit it. though the Titans preferred to refer to the plane as Tarterus. The name Othrys, as well as most of the names for the other layers of Carceri, were allegedly all derived from the special language of the greater titans. They were also the reason Othrys was referred to by some as '''Titan's Home''', since they were the layer's most famed inhabitants.

Of all the mountains of Othrys, the titans particularly congregated around [[Mount Othrys]]. The mountain hosted a great palace, a twisted echo of the edifices found on [[Olympus]], made of white [[marble]] that was brought with them down into Othrys. Over time the structure fell into disrepair, but the Titans could not leave Carceri to obtain marble to repair it with. Being a dilapidated, unrepairable echo of what the Titans once had on Olympus,{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|26}} the structure caused them both great frustration and pain, serving as a constant reminder of their lost glory.

A few greater titans managed to avoid imprisonment and still lived on the plane of Arborea, dwelling within its hinterlands. These titans were either nursing their grudges against Olympians or were completely oblivious as to most of the greater titans having been imprisoned.

==Relationships==
The Titans encouraged the development of creatures that lived on Mount Othrys, many of which were similar to those found on Olympus, making special pets of and would exact vengeance upon any who slayed them.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|14}}

They generally discouraged people from visiting them in Othrys, though occasionally planeswalkers or people from the [[Prime Material]] came to petition something from them. This could be either power or secrets of the [[multiverse]], or simply either advice or wisdom. And if they were in a good mood, the Titans might humor such requests. Because of these visitations a number of small hostels stood around the crumbling palace, which the Titans often smashed in the midst of unrelated frustrations.

Occasionally [[baatezu]] and [[tanar'ri]] also visited Mount Othrys, though more often it was the latter, both hoping the Titans could lend their incredible might against the other side in the [[Blood War]]. The Titans gave these visitors a surface level of respect, though only because they hoped the [[fiend]]s might harbor some secret means by which they could escape their eternal imprisonment. Once it became clear a particular fiend had little to offer them, the Titans would run them off their mountain in frustration.

==Notable Members==
The most notable of the greater titans that were imprisoned in Carceri included the following:
;[[Cronus]]: The leader of the greater titans. Some claimed he was the oldest male titan, while other accounts spoke of him being the youngest.<ref>
;Crius: The greater titan of density, gravity, and war. According to some accounts, he was the father of the Olympian [[Hecate]]<ref>
;Coeus: The greater titan of fear, cunning, and [[arcane magic]].
;[[Hyperion]]: The greater titan of the sun.
;Iapetus:
;Mnemosyne: The greater titan of memories.
;Oceanus: The greater titan of the sea and other bodies of water.
;Phebe:
;Tethys: The greater titan of [[elemental earth]] and justice.

One of the few not imprisoned within Carceri was [[Rhea (deity)|Rhea]], the former wife of Cronus and progenitor of the first generation of Olympian gods.
===Progeny & Servants===
All of the Titans came to birth [[lesser deity|lesser deities]] known as the [[lesser titan]]s. Some of them were loyal to their parents and became trapped in Carceri alongside them, where many of them became [[proxies]]. Others sided against them with the Olympians and were allowed to stay on Arborea.

Though the Titans were trapped in Carceri, they did have some agents and proxies. These were used to spy on and torment their enemies on the plane of Arborea.

==Worshipers==
Though the greater titans didn't require the worship of mortals to remain strong and the Olympians discouraged mortals from showing them reverence, this didn't stop some from worshiping them. The Titans didn't do anything to discourage reverence, though they somewhat feared retribution from the Olympians every time mortals called out their names.

==Rumors & Legends==
Some believed that the titans personified the building blocks of the Prime Material and that their continued existence was what kept the Prime functioning.

==History==
According to the Olympians' understanding of how the multiverse came to be, as documented in their the tome the ''Great Theogony'', before everything began there was nothing but an indescribable roiling mass of chaos. From this chaos arose various aspects of nature, During this time, the primeval god [[Uranus]] was created by Gaea and soon after the two married. They were favored by Uranus above all of the other children that he would come to have with Gaea, giving them special treatment.

Some of the children that followed were fair in appearance like the titans, whilst others were far more monstrous, such as the [[cyclops]]es and the [[hecatoncheire]]s. Horrified by their hideousness, to the point that he hated to look upon them, Uranus hid his monstrous progeny away far from the eyes and minds of mortals.

Some accounts told of Uranus locking his progeny up inside Gaea's own earthen depths, causing her pain. Others told of him imprisoning them in the plane of Tarterus. Regardless of where they were imprisoned, his act angered Gaea and over time she grew sickened by the imprisoned state of her children. Gaea then convinced the titan Cronus to overthrow his father and thus avenge her mistreatment.

Cronus, accepting the goading of his mother, did battle with Uranus. However, none of the other greater titans came to their brother's aid. Critically wounded by the battle, Uranus bled upon Gaea and thus fertilized her once more, causing the creation of the [[Furies]] and the [[gigante]]s. The wounded Uranus then fled from the battle to the farthest reaches of the multiverse.

Cronus then married the titan Rhea, becoming ruler of the titans, but went back on his word. Furious, Gaea laid a curse upon Cronus, proclaiming that one day his own children would usurp him, just as he had his usurped his cruel father. Fearful of the curse, Cronus devoured each of his first five children as they were born to his wife. These first five children were [[Demeter]], Hades, [[Hera]], Hestia, and [[Poseidon]].

On their sixth child, a furious Rhea tricked Cronus into instead swallowing a stone in swaddling clothes. This gave Gaea the chance to smuggle the child away, one who would later be known as [[Zeus]], and leave him in the care of [[nymph]]s on a remote island. When he reached adulthood, Zeus returned disguised as one of Cronus's cupbearers and gave him a [[potion]] that induced him into vomiting up his five other children.

The Olympian powers came together and fought the Titans, a conflict that would come to be known as the Titanomachy. After a decade of battle, the Olympians ultimately overcame the Titans and imprisoned them in the bowels of Carceri. Some of the Titans foresaw their downfall in this conflict and chose to flee to other planes. Of these the mightiest were tracked and captured by the Olympians, then sent down into Carceri with their siblings.

According to some accounts, Zeus had managed to convince some of the hecatoncheires to aid them in battle against the Titans and once the war was won he sent them down with the Titans to act as their guards, making the hecatoncheires too prisoners in all but name. Additionally, the Titans were initially [[chain]]ed up by Zeus within Carceri, but the god [[Hephaestus]] eventually convinced him that the chains were unnecessary.

Their mother Gaea initially made a number of attempts to avenge or liberate the Titans, sending a number of monsters against the Olympian powers, such as the gigantes. However, the new generation of gods held fast against her trials and would imprison the gigantes in Carceri alongside the Titans.
===History with Toril===
In the month of [[Hammer (month)|Hammer]], in the {{YearlinkName|1373}},{{LCRB}} a group of [[adventurer]]s from [[Ravens Bluff]] found themselves transported to the plane of Tarterus after defending the [[githzerai]] fortress of [[Tah'Darr]] from a [[tanar'ri]] incursion. At the urgings of the fallen [[paladin]] [[Elendil]], the adventurers sought out Mount Othrys and Cronus for a way back to their Prime Material world of [[Toril]].{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|9-10}} When they first entered the crumbling palace they were greeted by a {{SI|50|ft}} tall marble pillar, with a column of twenty [[spear]]s jammed down one crack, each impaled with the severed head of a man. They were then approached by the titan responsible, [[Chiron]], who demanded tribute from them in exchange for an audience with his father.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|15}} Eventually the group made their way to Cronus, deep into some kind of [[Cosmic Game]] with the [[marilith]] [[Cucathne]], the latter of whom was entertaining the Titan with the game in hopes of negotiating the use of Othrys as a tanar'ri staging ground against Tah'Darr.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|17,32}} Cronus was unwilling to answer any questions that the mortals posed, but offered to gate them home if they would fight as part of his forces in the game.{{Cite organized play/LC/No Time to Lose|16}}
