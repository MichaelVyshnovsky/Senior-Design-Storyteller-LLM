        "mainbody": "he Claws of the Sun and the Ankh were an order of fearless Mulhorandi paladins of Horus-Re, who devote themselves to their divine responsibilities rather than politics of the nation. They acted in fanatical pursuit of the followers of Set, and were granted divine powers to smite any whom they encountered.\nThey were the first paladin order of Mulhorand that were dedicated to a deity other than Osiris.\nPaladins of the Sun and the Ankh were able to draw upon the divine power of Horus-Re and partially transform themselves, turning their hands into claws of a hawk."
