The '''Company of the Hunt''' was a criminal [[Malarite]] organization that operated in the [[Vilhon Reach]] and the [[Land of the Lions]] in the late-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The group was nothing but a ragtag group of fifty [[human]] outlaws who venerated [[Malar]], or the Stalker, the deity's aspect worshiped in the Vilhon Reach. The band was led by [[huntmaster]] [[Jaras Silverblood]] in the late-14{{th}} century DR. The group made home in the [[Winterwood]] in the Lake of Steam region from whence they organized attacks and raids on the Vilhon Reach.

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the Company of the Hunt were enemies of [[Sespech]], regularly raiding and attacking the nation every time an opportunity presented itself. The outlaw band was especially hated in the land of [[Turmish]], where Jaras Silverblood was wanted for a murder of a politician member of the [[Assembly of Stars]].
