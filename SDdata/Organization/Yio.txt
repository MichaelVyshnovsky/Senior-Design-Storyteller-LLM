The Yio were a tiny magical race of people claimed to exist in Koryo in Kara-Tur. This was according to local legend in Tu Pe around 1357 DR, where they were said to live beneath the floating city there.
Supposedly they rode on the backs of rats and dwelled in hidden hives or nests. If they nested in ones house, then the homeowner was honored and would receive good luck. They also stole shiny things, such as bells, keys, and rings, so they were generally regarded as a nuisance. However, darker tales told of them attacking and killing people who disturbed their hives, and even of them kidnapping babies.
