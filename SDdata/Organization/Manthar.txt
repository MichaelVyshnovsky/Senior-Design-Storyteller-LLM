The '''Manthar''' ({{Pronounce|MAN|thar|refs=}}) family was part of the [[nobility of Waterdeep]], ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. They had diverse interests in the metal trade, mercenary services, and fine perfumes.

==Organization==
House Manthar provided swords-for-hire to those that could afford the service. They also had significant investments in trading metals and perfumes. From at least the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, to at least the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the patriarch of the family was Lord [[Ithnil Manthar|Ithnil]]. His consort was Lady [[Churyl Manthar|Churyl]], and they had at least one son, [[Carn Manthar|Carn]].

==Base of Operations==
[[File:MantharVilla-1372.png|thumb|right|270px|''The Manthar family villa (labeled $36) ''circa'' 1372 DR.'']]
The Manthar family home was a mansion on the northwest corner of [[Shield Street]] and [[Delzorin Street]] at the very edge of the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] (across Shield Street was the [[Sultlue]] family villa in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]]). The Manthar compound was made up of some low, 1-story buildings and a 3-story villa in the middle of the block.

==History==
The Manthars were of [[Illuskan]] descent and remained fairly neutral in outlook as befitted mercenaries. The family was ennobled in the {{YearlinkName|1265}}, and numbered forty-one living members as of 1372 DR.

On the [[Hammer 9|{{Format FR date|9 Hammer|of|nth|commonName}}]] in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Lord Carn's lover and fiancé, Lady Syleda Krimmevol, gave birth to fraternal twins, and they had plans to marry on [[Greengrass]] of that year. However, unknown to everyone except the [[Unseen]], Lady Syleda had been replaced by a [[greater doppelganger]] before she even arrived in Waterdeep. This was part of a program by the Unseen to get one of their mirrorkin to be an heir to a noble house. The children bore striking resemblance to their parents because they were also mirrorkin.<ref name=CD-13">

Fearful that Syleda's true nature would be discovered, the Unseen recalled her on [[Tarsakh 30]]&mdash;the day before the wedding&mdash;and the sudden abandonment of her children and fiancé was generally credited to foul play.<ref name=CD-14">
