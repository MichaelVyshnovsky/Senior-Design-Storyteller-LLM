The '''Dawn War pantheon''' was a [[pantheon]] of [[god]]s worshiped on the worlds of [[Nerath]], [[w:c:criticalrole:Exandria|Exandria]], and other worlds of the [[multiverse]].

==Organization==
===Membership===
The gods of the Dawn War pantheon were a small group of deities that banded together during the [[Dawn War]]. They kept a loose alliance of coexistence (even between gods of [[Good]] and [[Evil]]) and mutual help against common enemies. The alliance was maintained by the "compact of heaven," in which the gods agreed to share power in the natural world and shared control over [[angel]]s. The compact included Evil in its terms but not [[Chaos]], making it troublesome for chaotic deities to enforce the power of the compact at times.

==Activities==
The gods of the Dawn War pantheon were "universal" gods, meaning that even if they were "racial" gods they were worshiped by members of all [[:Category:Races|races]] instead of just the races they created.

==Relationships==
As mentioned above, the Dawn War pantheon was an alliance of gods under the terms of the "compact of heaven". Despite rivalries and hatreds between its members, the gods of the Dawn War pantheon were aware that the existence of their alliance (and by extension the survival of their rival deities) was necessary to survive against threats such as the [[primordial]]s or the [[Far Realm]].

==History==
The Dawn War pantheon was created out of necessity, as a small group of gods from different worlds allied together to survive during the Dawn War. When the primordials attacked the worlds of [[Realmspace]], the gods of the Dawn War pantheon were summoned to [[Abeir-Toril]] by [[Selûne]] and [[Shar]] to help the twin goddesses to defend Realmspace.

By the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], some of the Dawn War gods still had some degree of influence on [[Toril]].

==Members==
The following were the members of the Dawn War pantheon known on the world of Nerath:
;[[Asmodeus]]:
: A god of Tyranny and Domination, and lord of the [[Nine Hells]].
;Avandra:
: A goddess of Change, Luck and Travel, and patron of [[halfling]]s.
;[[Bahamut]]:
: The [[dragon]] god of Justice, Protection and Nobility, and patron of [[metallic dragon]]s and good [[dragonborn]].
;Bane:
: A god of War and Conquest, revered by [[goblinoid]]s.{{Cite dragon/372/Deities and Demigods: Bane|26-27}} He was however, entirely unrelated to the [[Bane]] of the Faerûnian pantheon.{{Cite dragon
