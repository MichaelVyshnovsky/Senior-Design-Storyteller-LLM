        "Reputation": "In the late 15th Century, the members of House Ambershield were known to be steadfast and adamant - resisting reforms by King [[Foril Obarskyr I]] and attempts to corrupt them alike.\n\n[[Helindra Crownsilver]] held a dim view of the Ambershields, once remarking that she is unlike them, and so would not turn a sick guest out of their [[tallhouse]].",
        "Base": "[[Ambershields Hall]] in Suzail served as the domicile of the head of the house in the late 15th Century.\n\nThe entrance to the Hall was bedecked by average heighted stone and copper doors that shone brightly under light. To the side, stood sculpted winged lions under a wide, raised stone porch.",
        "Members": "'''Late 15th Century'''\n* [[Florelle Ambershield]], the shy lady-in-waiting and friend to the then Princess [[Raedra Obarskyr]]. She was also good friends with [[Varauna Goldfeather]] and had an old feud with [[Pelarra Huntsilver]].\n* [[Stossian Ambershield]], who advised [[Baerovus Obarskyr (prince)]] that while his coronation was not necessary, a proper one at court would sooth his subjects."
