        "mainbody": "The '''Redbrands''', sometimes called the '''Redbrand Ruffians''', were a group of bandits and brigands active in the resettled frontier town of [[Phandalin]] and nearby [[Triboar Trail (region)|Triboar Trail region]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Organization": "The Redbrands mostly consisted of [[human]]s, male and female, although a handful of [[bugbear]]s were also in the bandit group. Each Redbrand wore a simple, dirty scarlet cloak. These cloaks were recognized by the [[undead]] in their hideout, [[Tresendar Manor]], and stopped them from attacking the bandits.\n\nThey were led by a mysterious wizard who they called [[Glasstaff]].",
        "Activities": "The Redbrands terrorized Phandalin's locals with threats and demands for protection money, which escalated into murder and kidnapping. In addition, they would capture travelers to be sold as [[Slavery|slaves]]. Slaves and illicit goods were smuggled into and out of Phandalin via a secret tunnel which connected to the basement of their base beneath Tresendar Manor.\n\nApart from terrorizing the local populace, the Redbrands enjoyed drinking at the [[Sleeping Giant]] tavern.",
        "History": "The Redbrands were founded by a traitorous agent of the [[Lords' Alliance]] named [[Iarno Albrek]], calling himself \"Glasstaff\", in the {{YearlinkName|1491}}.\n\nWith no local lord or powerful authority within the small town, the Redbrands were able to harass the farmers and prospectors for two months. At some point, the Black Spider sent a group of bugbears to join the group and assist in keeping the people of Phandalin in line.\n\nThings eventually escalated to a breaking point when the Redbrands killed the woodcarver, [[Thel Dendrar]], and kidnapped his wife, [[Mirna Dendrar|Mirna]], and their children, [[Nars Dendrar|Nars]] and [[Nilsa Dendrar|Nilsa]]. Soon after, the group was defeated and cleared from their hideout by a group of [[adventurer]]s.",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Brawn McGable]] was a member who remained in Phandalin after the group's dissolution.\n* [[Droop]], a [[goblin]] slave of the Black Spider's bugbears.\n* [[Iarno Albrek]], aka \"Glasstaff\", was the direct leader of the Redbrands operating from their base at Tresendar Manor.\n* [[Mosk]], the leader of the gang's bugbears.\n* [[Nezznar]], aka \"the Black Spider\", was the true leader and directed Iarno's actions."
