The '''Neverwinter Nine''' were the personal bodyguards of Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]], the leader of [[Neverwinter]] in the late years of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They later swore allegiance to his descendants, the [[Alagondar]] royal bloodline. The group was named after the nine guards of the founder of Neverwinter, Lord [[Halueth Never]].

==History==
===Original Nine===
According to legend, before the foundation of Neverwinter, Lord Halueth Never gathered a group of his most loyal guards and named them the Neverwinter Nine. Under his lead, the Nine and his army prevailed in the war with [[Illusk]]. However, two of them perished in the war, and one died as a traitor, for murdering his fellow Nine. After his death, Halueth was buried in his tomb beneath [[Castle Never]], surrounded by the statues of the first Nine, their names carved on the statues.

===Lord Nasher Alagondar's Nine===
Inspired by the legends, choosing its members from among his most selfless and good men and women, to serve as his bodyguards.

After the death of Lord Nasher, the Neverwinter Nine swore fealty to his descendants, the [[Alagondar]]s.

After the deaths of the original Nine, they became celebrated heroes of Neverwinter. Their remains were entombed in a crypt below Castle Never, known as the "''[[Castle Never#Vault of the Nine|Vault of the Nine]]''", protected with powerful magic seals to allow their souls to rest unmolested.

The Alagondars knighted a new generation of Neverwinter Nine to serve them.It can be assumed that there were at least two generations of Neverwinter Nine following the ones knighted by Lord Nasher, as the ''[[Neverwinter Campaign Setting]]'' states that the Neverwinter Nine were the bodyguards of the Alagondars, and that all the closer servants of the Alagondars died with them during the Ruining, in page 148, while also describing the Vault of Nine as the place of rest for the Nine of Nasher's time, in page 152.

===Attempts to Resurrect the Nine===
In [[1479 DR]], [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] was conducting arcane experiments in the hopes of controlling the [[ghost]]s of Lord Nasher's Neverwinter Nine, although she was unable to do it using what resources she had in hand.

The [[dragonborn]] [[necromancer]] [[Morlanth]] attempted to raise the Neverwinter Nine as [[wraith]]s using the [[Shroud of Souls]], but was stopped by adventurers.

In the late 15{{t h}} century DR, the attempts to resurrect the Nine were quite literal. The [[artifact]] known as the ''[[Sigil of the Nine]]'' was used by the heroes of the [[Siege of Neverwinter]]. It called to the souls of the Neverwinter Nine to join in the battle to protect Neverwinter from peril.

==Possessions==
The Neverwinter Nine of Lord Nasher's time all wore [[magic]] [[armor]]s and had magical [[sword]]s, and also had access to all the [[magic item]]s Lord Nasher had acquired during his career as an [[adventurer]]. believed to be a symbol of protection by the locals.
