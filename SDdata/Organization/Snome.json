        "mainbody": "The '''Snome''' ({{Pronounce|ssNOmm|refs=}}) family was a [[human]] noble family in [[Waterdeep]]. Their primary interests were in brewing, distilling, importing, and exporting alcoholic beverages.",
        "Organization": "The Snome family made their fortune by brewing [[beer]], distilling spirits, and importing those same commodities to a thirsty Waterdeep. In the midâ€“14{{th}} century, the family patriarch was Lord [[Arrabas Snome|Arrabas]]. Before he passed away, ''circa'' [[1370 DR]], he chose his successor to be his youngest grandson, [[Dandobar Snome|Dandobar]].",
        "Base of Operations": "The Snome estate was located in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] on the corner of [[Phull Lane]] and [[Trollkill Street]]. The family villa was set back from both roads in a walled compound. Behind it was an alley that connected Phull Lane and Trollkill Street. Across Trollkill Street was the [[Trollwall]].<ref name=CoS-CG-43\">",
        "History": "The Snome family villa was built in the {{YearlinkName|1249}}.\n\nThe clan was ennobled in the {{YearlinkName|1273}} and were of [[Illuskan]] descent. The head of the family skipped a generation because Arrabas, at age 112, had outlived all of his fourteen children and had to select an heir from a bevy of 47 grandchildren. [[Thyriellentha Snome]] felt slighted when Arrabas chose her cousin Dandobar over her and she distanced herself from the family because of it. Once Dandobar became the head of the family, he named Thyriellentha as his heir, but this did little to mollify the ambitious woman.",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Arrabas Snome]]: Ancient patriarch until at least [[1368 DR]]. Grandfather of Thyriellentha and Dandobar.\n* [[Dandobar Snome]]: Head of the family, ''circa'' 1370 DR. Youngest grandson of Arrabas.\n* [[Thyriellentha Snome]]: Mage Civilar of the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] in the 1360s and 1370s DR. Eldest granddaughter of Arrabas.",
        "Rumors & Legends": "During the period 1249 to [[1369 DR]], the family lost seventeen servants, one at a time, always on the night of [[Shieldmeet]] during a fete hosted by the Snomes. Scant evidence seemed to dictate that they abandoned their posts and left town, but the true cause was a ''[[portal]]'' in the locked doorway to the section of the wine cellar that held the lord's private supplies. The ''portal'' was a one-way gate to the [[Crystal Labyrinth]] in [[Undermountain]] that was only active on Shieldmeet at night. During the event known as [[Halaster's Higharvestide]], this ''portal'' worked in both directions, but it is unknown if anyone or anything passed through it.",
