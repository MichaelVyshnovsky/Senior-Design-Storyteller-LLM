The Triple Legion was a mercenary organization within the Sevenfold Mazework of the Great Dismal Delve.
The Triple Legion was made-up of 800 xorn mercenaries.
This mercenary group was used by the dao for scouting and spy missions. They were well-paid but not trusted. The dao kept them far from the palace of the Great Khan.
The Sevenfold Mazework within the Great Dismal Delve served as base of all dao military organizations.
