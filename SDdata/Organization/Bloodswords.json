        "mainbody": "The '''Bloodswords''' was a mercenary company that originated in [[Amn]] and operated within the [[Western Heartlands]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "These mercenaries had an agreement with the [[Zhentarim]] where they would drive away any non-[[Zhent]] caravans and unwanted travelers in the region of the [[High Road]] north of the [[Bridge of Fallen Men]] and west of the [[Eagle Peak]] in the [[Storm Horns]]. They would openly fight with any patrols from [[Cormyr]] or adventurers who attempted to cross their territory and would only allow certain [[Amn]]ian merchants to travel eastward into the mountain pass.\n\nThanks to the efforts of the Bloodswords, exclusive trade routes to the nations of Amn and [[Tethyr]], within the [[Lands of Intrigue]], opened up to the Zhent forces."
