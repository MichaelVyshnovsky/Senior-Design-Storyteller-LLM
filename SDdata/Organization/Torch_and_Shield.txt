'''Torch and Shield''' was a cooperative caravan organization that was headquartered in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|72}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 56: Khôltar, Part 7, Leaving the Farrgaunlar}}

==Activities==
This coster gathered small shipments, merchant wagons, and travelers into larger, organized overland caravans that were more economical to protect while traveling together. Security was provided by their own guards or hired mercenaries and adventurers.

==Base of Operations==
The Torch and Shield had offices on the [[North Way]], one of the main thoroughfares in the Iron City that ran between Farrgaunlar and Handrornlar (the southern and northern gates through the walls of Khôltar, respectively).
