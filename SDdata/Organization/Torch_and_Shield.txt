Torch and Shield was a cooperative caravan organization that was headquartered in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
This coster gathered small shipments, merchant wagons, and travelers into larger, organized overland caravans that were more economical to protect while traveling together. Security was provided by their own guards or hired mercenaries and adventurers.
The Torch and Shield had offices on the North Way, one of the main thoroughfares in the Iron City that ran between Farrgaunlar and Handrornlar (the southern and northern gates through the walls of Khôltar, respectively).
