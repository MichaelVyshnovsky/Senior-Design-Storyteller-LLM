The '''Argents''' were a noble family of [[human]]s and [[aasimar]] from the city-state of [[Waterdeep]].

==Activities==
The family had strong ties to the militant warriors of [[Lathander]] known as the [[Order of the Aster]]. Several members of the Argent family joined their ranks for service throughout the years.

==Possessions==
One of the family's heirlooms was an [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] suit of armor, the ''[[Mail of the Hallowed Hero]]''.

==History==
While the family had some divine heritage, it appeared dormant in its members for generations before the [[Era of Upheaval]].

Some time before the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, [[Aun Argent]] saved his niece Caelar from damnation when she inadvertently opened a ''[[portal]]'' to the [[Nine Hells]] by reading from the ''[[Tome of the Nine]]''.

As it turned out, Caelar became the first member of the Argent family to exhibit noticeable traits of their aasimar lineage.

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, Caelar led a [[Shining Crusade|crusade]] to march on [[Dragonspear Castle]] with the goal of rescuing her uncle from the clutches of [[Belhifet]] in [[Avernus]].

==Members==
* [[Olen Argent]], a noble warrior who fought for just causes
* [[Aun Argent]], a dutiful paladin of the Order of the Aster
* [[Caelar Argent]], the proud crusader known as the "Shining Lady"
