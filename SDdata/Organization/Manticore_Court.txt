The '''Manticore Court''' was a body of government in  the coastal town of [[Tulmon]] on the [[Lake of Steam]] in [[south Faer√ªn]].<ref name=EotSS-p163">

==History==
The court was heavily financed by many of rival [[Suldophor]]'s wealthiest families, ensuring Tulmon's neighbors were represented. This usually came in the form of Tulmon's crafters producing what Suldophor wanted or needed.<ref name=EotSS-p163"/>

==Defenses==
A pair of enchanted [[manticore]] statues guarded the entrance to the court building, giving the court its name.<ref name=EotSS-p163"/>
