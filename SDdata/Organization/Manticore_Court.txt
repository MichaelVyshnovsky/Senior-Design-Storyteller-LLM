The Manticore Court was a body of government in  the coastal town of Tulmon on the Lake of Steam in south Faer√ªn.
The court was heavily financed by many of rival Suldophors wealthiest families, ensuring Tulmons neighbors were represented. This usually came in the form of Tulmons crafters producing what Suldophor wanted or needed.
A pair of enchanted manticore statues guarded the entrance to the court building, giving the court its name.
