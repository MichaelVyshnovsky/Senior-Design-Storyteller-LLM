The '''Blood Axe Smashers''', who were also called the '''Smashers''', were a [[Zhentilar]] patrol of wicked [[humanoid]]s that operated out of [[Darkhold]] during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].

The symbol of the Smashers was a large skull on a purple field which was designed to be an insult to the [[Purple Dragons]].

==Organization==
The group was led by an [[scro]] named [[Thergod]]. Those under Thergod's command included sixteen [[ogre]]s and a trio of [[hill giant]]s. 

==Activities==
The Blood Axe Smashers had never been defeated in battle and were skilled in setting elaborate ambushes for their targets. The Smashers were such a threat that King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]] offered a reward of 2,000 [[gp]] for their destruction.
