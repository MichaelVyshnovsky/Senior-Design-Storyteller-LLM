The '''Teerac''' were a tribe of settled [[goblin]]s who lived in [[Teerac-on-Water]], a village between the [[Goblin Marches]] and the [[Stonelands]].

==Organization==
The tribe revered and protected a [[shaman]] who directed the construction of wooden structures and boats.

==Activities==
The tribe lived on a small island in their lake, building wooden boats and barges, and expanding their village out onto the water with wooden homes. They obtained much of their food by fishing the lake, but also farmed fruit and leafy vegetables on the shore of the water. They harvested an unusual blood-red lily that seemed to extend their lifespans, with individuals of over 100 years of age noted.

==Tactics==
The Teerac defended their village with domesticated [[giant frog]]s, and sought to tame other useful creatures. Unlike most goblins they were not nocturnal and could tolerate the light of the sun, and so operated openly in daylight. Also unusual for goblins of the region, they wore metal armor in battle.

==Relationships==
The Teerac controlled a small area around their lake and often raided nearby tribes, taking slaves whenever possible. They also tunneled down beneath their village and the lake, discovering the [[Underdark]] and a group of [[bugbear]]s whom they formed an alliance with.
