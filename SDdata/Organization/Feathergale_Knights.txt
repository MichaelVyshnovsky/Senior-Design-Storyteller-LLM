The '''Feathergale Knights''', or '''Feathergale Society''', was a sub-branch of the [[Cult of the Howling Hatred]] during the [[Elemental Evil]] crisis.

==Activities==
The Feathergale Knights usually acted as elite forces of the Howling Hatred cult or they surveyed the land around Feathergale Spire, guarding the entrance to the air cult's hidden temple.

==Tactics and Philosophy==
The Feathergale Knights believed themselves above the Howling Hatred cultists, whom they considered lunatic perverts. They believed they had made tremendous sacrifices in order to make their country strong. In truth, however, they were deeply corrupted by [[Yan-C-Bin]]'s influence and each of them had committed so many crimes that they'd earned the dislike of all those they believed they protected.

==History==
The Feathergale Knights were founded in [[Waterdeep]] by [[Thurl Merosska]], who gathered around himself people of similar minds from among the wealthy of Waterdeep. Thurl selected his knights one by one.

With reluctance, they pledged their loyalty to [[Aerisi Kalinoth]].

In [[1491 DR]], they established themselves at the [[Feathergale Spire]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] waiting for the right time to summon Yan-C-Bin to [[Toril]]. However, in the Spire, some adventurers defeated them.
