The '''church of Tchazzar''' was the collective worshipers of [[Tchazzar]], the [[red dragon]] hero-king that founded [[Chessenta]] during the 10{{th}} century [[DR]]. During the [[Era of Upheaval]], it was considered among one of the most popular faiths in all of Chessenta.

==Organization==
Tchazzar's [[holy symbol]] was the profile of a red dragon, set over a black mountain.

==Activities==
Missionaries of the faith traveled far and wide across Chessenta, extolling the dragon king's virtues and sharings tales of his great victories.

==Base of Operations==
Tchazzar's church was centered in the Chessentan city of [[Cimbar]]. Smaller congregations also formed in the cities of [[Airspur]] and [[Akanax]].

==Equipment, Spells, and Relics==
Initiates of Tchazzar's faith were granted access to certain spells, including ''[[flare]]'', ''[[flame blade]]'', ''[[Palarandusk's fire breath]]'', ''[[fireball]]'', ''[[magic vestment]]'', and ''[[fire shield]]''.

The most favored of Tchazzar's faithful were given pendants each called the ''[[eye of Tchazzar]]''.

==Orders==
The [[Blades of Tchazzar]] was the military branch of Tchazzar's church. They were commanded by directly by the Father of Chessenta on missions critical to his faith.

==Relationships==
===Allies===
Despite Tchazzar's personal service to [[Tiamat]] the Dragon Queen, his church remained almost entirely neutral to the [[church of Tiamat]]. While the members of each faith shared similar goals, they seldom if ever worked in partnership with the others.

===Enemies===
The church garnered many foes among the rulers of Chessentan cities during the late 14{{th}} century, most notably in Airspur, [[Luthcheq]], and
[[Soorenar]] (before its downfall). The church was also considered among the foes of both righteous powers, such as the [[the Triad|Triadic]] crusaders of [[Impiltur]], and more malevolent groups, like the original [[Cult of the Dragon]].

Due to Tchazzar's centuries-long feud with [[Alasklerbanbastos]], minions of the Great Bone Wyrm were considered hostile enemies. There existed however a tenuous d√©tente between the church and the Great Bone Wyrm's forces in [[Threskel]] and [[Unther]], as those cities were allied with the Untheric branch of [[Church of Tiamat|Tiamat's church]].

==History==
While the roots of Tchazzar's church originated some time during or around his rise to power, it became entrenched in Chessentan lore following the dragon king's disappearance in the {{YearlinkName|1018}}. It was among the many hero-cults that became prominent throughout the realm at the time.

===Era of Upheaval===
During the [[Time of Troubles]], in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Tchazzar received one third of [[Tiamat]]'s divine essence, becoming part of Tiamat's Trinity. In short time, Tchazzar consumed the other two members of the trinity, fulfilling the conditions to ascend as the [[aspect]] of [[Tiamat]], one that assumed her physical form in the Realms. The church became emboldened at that time, and appeared who wholly take over the pre-existing hero cult.

Just over a decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, the church was renewed in strength once again, when Tchazzar appeared in the Realms in his true form as a [[demipower]]. but this would only last a scant few years. After the [[Spellplague]] struck the Realms in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, Cimbar was destroyed and Tchazzar himself went missing.

A new incarnation of Tchazzar reappeared in the Realms during the [[Era of Upheaval]], claiming the city of [[Erebos]] as its own.

==Notable Members==
* [[Lukos Dyranni]], one of the [[Talon of Tiamat|Talons]] of Tiamat.
* [[Tiranna Melphans]], a [[half-dragon|half]]-[[red dragon]] sorcerer of [[mulan]] descent.
