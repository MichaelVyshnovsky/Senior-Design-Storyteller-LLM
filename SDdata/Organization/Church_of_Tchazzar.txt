The church of Tchazzar was the collective worshipers of Tchazzar, the red dragon hero-king that founded Chessenta during the 10 century DR. During the Era of Upheaval, it was considered among one of the most popular faiths in all of Chessenta.
Tchazzars holy symbol was the profile of a red dragon, set over a black mountain.
Missionaries of the faith traveled far and wide across Chessenta, extolling the dragon kings virtues and sharings tales of his great victories.
Tchazzars church was centered in the Chessentan city of Cimbar. Smaller congregations also formed in the cities of Airspur and Akanax.
Initiates of Tchazzars faith were granted access to certain spells, including flare, flame blade, Palarandusks fire breath, fireball, magic vestment, and fire shield.
The most favored of Tchazzars faithful were given pendants each called the eye of Tchazzar.
The Blades of Tchazzar was the military branch of Tchazzars church. They were commanded by directly by the Father of Chessenta on missions critical to his faith.
Despite Tchazzars personal service to Tiamat the Dragon Queen, his church remained almost entirely neutral to the church of Tiamat. While the members of each faith shared similar goals, they seldom if ever worked in partnership with the others.
The church garnered many foes among the rulers of Chessentan cities during the late 14 century, most notably in Airspur, Luthcheq, and
Soorenar (before its downfall). The church was also considered among the foes of both righteous powers, such as the Triadic crusaders of Impiltur, and more malevolent groups, like the original Cult of the Dragon.
Due to Tchazzars centuries-long feud with Alasklerbanbastos, minions of the Great Bone Wyrm were considered hostile enemies. There existed however a tenuous d√©tente between the church and the Great Bone Wyrms forces in Threskel and Unther, as those cities were allied with the Untheric branch of Tiamats church.
While the roots of Tchazzars church originated some time during or around his rise to power, it became entrenched in Chessentan lore following the dragon kings disappearance in the . It was among the many hero-cults that became prominent throughout the realm at the time.
During the Time of Troubles, in the , Tchazzar received one third of Tiamats divine essence, becoming part of Tiamats Trinity. In short time, Tchazzar consumed the other two members of the trinity, fulfilling the conditions to ascend as the aspect of Tiamat, one that assumed her physical form in the Realms. The church became emboldened at that time, and appeared who wholly take over the pre-existing hero cult.
Just over a decade later, in the , the church was renewed in strength once again, when Tchazzar appeared in the Realms in his true form as a demipower. but this would only last a scant few years. After the Spellplague struck the Realms in the , Cimbar was destroyed and Tchazzar himself went missing.
A new incarnation of Tchazzar reappeared in the Realms during the Era of Upheaval, claiming the city of Erebos as its own.
