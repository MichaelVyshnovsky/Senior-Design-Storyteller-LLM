'''Clan Relguld''' was a [[dragonheir]] clan of the [[Sword Lands]] of [[Laerakond]].

==History==
Clan Relguld was one of the oldest clans of Laerakond. Its members were descendants of the first [[human]] roostmasters of the [[primordial]]s, who lived millennia before the [[Spellplague]].

In the late years of the 15th century [[DR]] clan Relguld was a diminished clan, in decline and with only a few surviving individuals, scattered throughout the Sword Lands.
