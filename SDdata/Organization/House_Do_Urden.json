        "mainbody": "ouse DoUrden, also known by its ancient and formal name, Daermon Nashezbaernon, The house was reformed as the eighth house in 1484 DR by Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre.\nThe DoUrden compound was located in the district of West Wall in Menzoberranzan. It was in fact built into the wall, with stalagmites forming the posts for the main gate.\nThe two-level cave complex housed most of the houses residents. The first level featured a maze of tunnels, residences, training grounds, and a two-story chapel along the back wall. No stairs led to the upper level, restricting entrance only to nobles (who had levitation abilities), who could enter through the chapel or front balcony.\nThe ruling family lived within a set of suites on the upper level. The patron lived in a two-room suite, and the weapon masters three-room suite included private quarters, a training area, and the houses war room.\nAfter the house was destroyed in 1339 DR, the compound remained in ruins for more than a century. House Barrison DelArmgo and House Melarn used the ruins as training grounds for their troops until 1484 DR, Quenthel Baenre ordered Bregan Daerthe to clear the grounds in preparation for the houses restoration.\nthumb|Members of the House DoUrden 440x440px\nHouse DoUrden was ranked tenth house in the city until 1297 DR. In that year, the day on which Drizzt DoUrden was born to Matron Mother Malice DoUrden, House DoUrden attacked House DeVir, the fourth house. Using the power involved in Drizzts birth, Malice and her priestesses were able to create a spell capable of defeating House DeVir. With this defeat House DoUrden became the ninth house. During the battle, eldest son Nalfein, a house wizard, was assassinated by the second son Dinin.\nHouse DoUrden was favored by the ruling House Baenre, and therefore by Lolth, for many years. However, during a surface raid, Drizzt saved the life of an elven child (Ellifain), and House DoUrden lost the favor of Lolth. Other houses discovered the houses fall from grace, and in 1328 DR House Hunett began its covert attack on House DoUrden. To regain Lolths favor, Malice sacrificed Zaknafein DoUrden, the father of Drizzt, instead of sacrificing Drizzt. This action was the \"last straw\" that led to Drizzt deserting Menzoberranzan and wandering the Underdark for a decade. During that decade, House DoUrden and House Hunett continued to feud, neither having the favor of Lolth and each weakening the other but never to the others victory.\nIn 1338 DR, House Hunett hired Bregan Daerthe to launch a full-on frontal assault on House DoUrden. However, Malice entreated Jarlaxle, the bands leader, with a better offer and Bregan Daerthe turned on House Hunett. House DoUrden won the day and became the eighth house of Menzoberranzan. However, due to the weakened state of House DoUrden, Matron Yvonnel Baenre ordered SiNafay Hunett, formerly the matron of House Hunett, to become a priestess of House DoUrden under the name Shinayne DoUrden. Matron Baenre also insisted that House DoUrden take care of the renegade Drizzt in order to reobtain Lolths favor.\nDrizzts siblings Briza and Dinin tracked down their rogue brother in the wilds of the Underdark but failed to bring him home or kill him. Malice took her biggest risk and summoned Zin-carla, a spirit-wraith, to hunt down Drizzt. To gain the power to do this, she sacrificed SiNafay at the altar and used the long-dead body of Zaknafein as zin-carlas host. However, during his trek to hunt down Drizzt, the mind and senses of Zaknafein returned enough for him to jump into an acid pit in order to save his son. Thus, Zin-carla failed and Drizzt was not captured Lolths favor was lost forevermore. Briza killed her mother for her failure, becoming the new matron mother, but at that moment House Baenre moved in to destroy House DoUrden on behalf of Lolth. Vierna and Dinin were taken in by Bregan Daerthe and survived.\nIn 1357 DR, Vierna tried to rebuild House DoUrden by attempting to kill Drizzt. With the help of Bregan Daerthe and Dinin (whom she turned into a drider), she attacked Mithral Hall. During the attack, Bruenor Battlehammer slew Dinin, and Drizzt slew Vierna, leaving Drizzt as the last known surviving DoUrden.\nBy 1484 DR, soldiers and driders of House Melarn, as well as soldiers of House Barrison DelArmgo, were using the abandoned DoUrden compound as a training ground. That year, Bregan Daerthe soldiers, led by Jarlaxle (named Captain of the Guard), were hired by House Baenre to clear the compound in preparation for the reconstruction and restoration of House DoUrden as part of Matron Mother Quenthel Baenres plans to conquer the Silver Marches.\nTo form the house membership, Quenthel selected a number of drow from other houses, starting with her own sister, SosUmptu Baenre, to serve as temporary matron mother. SosUmptu was quickly replaced by Dahlia Sinfelle after the latters capture and corruption at the hands of Gromph Baenre and Methil El-Viddenvelp. Tiago Baenre was to serve as house weapon master after his return to Menzoberranzan. Tosun Armgo, recently returned from the surface with his daughter, was to serve as house patron. The houses garrison and foot soldiers were taken from Bregan Daerthe, supported by House Baenre. The house was given a position on the Ruling Council as the eighth house.\nthumb|DoUrden family, from left to right 440x440px\n*Briza DoUrden Eldest daughter of Malice and First Priestess, last Matron Mother, killed by Jarlaxle of Bregan Daerthe in 1339 DR.\n*Dinin DoUrden Second-born son of Malice later turned into a drider by his sister, Vierna, and killed by Bruenor Battlehammer.\n*Drizzt DoUrden Third-born son of Malice and son of Zaknafein\n*Malice DoUrden Matron Mother from 918 DR to 1339 DR killed by Briza just before the houses fall.\n*Maya DoUrden Third daughter of Malice killed during the housess fall.\n*Nalfein DoUrden Firstborn son of Malice, killed by Dinin in 1297 DR.\n*Ozomar DoUrden House wizard, formerly of House Druugiir.\n*Rizzen DoUrden House patron killed by the spirit-wraith Zaknafein under the orders of Matron Malice.\n*ShiNayne DoUrden Formerly known as Matron SiNafay Hunett, was adopted into House DoUrden following the fall of her house.
