Horn Enclave was the legendary stronghold of Clan Horn which, in addition to housing the leaders of the clan,  also contained a number of extremely secure vaults. The enclave was home to over a hundred dwarves, of which nearly half were guards.
Clan Horn owned a number of holds and estates across the breadth of the Spine of the World mountains.
One of the great treasures said to be contained in the vaults of Horn Enclave was the wheel of stars, a component of the legendary artifact called the Orrery of the Wanderer.

The archmage Elminster Aumar considered himself a blood brother of Clan Horn (alongside Clans Deepaxe, Gallowglar, Bucklebar, and Worldthrone).
