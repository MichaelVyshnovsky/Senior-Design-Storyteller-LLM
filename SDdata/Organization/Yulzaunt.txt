The Yulzaunt House was a rich and influential bloodline and part of the Onsruur (council of lords) that governed Kh√¥ltar, the Iron City, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
Members of this human family were distinguished by their great height and slender build. They had an interest in the medical and healing professions, producing quite a few healers, apothecaries, and experts on illness and disease.
The Yulzaunt were not altruistic enough to help those in need for free they typically sold their medical advice and remedies to the sickly. This clan had extensive real estate holdings in the Iron City and rented most of it out. This dovetailed with their sponsorship of many businesses in town, particularly those run by gnomes and halflings. Outside the walls, they owned ranches that produced herds of beasts that they sold in a dozen countries.
It was standard practice for the Yulzaunt to manipulate the meat market by attempting to create scarcity in an area and wait for the price to rise before driving their herds in to sell for bigger profits.
The Yulzaunts were close allies with the Voaphangh family, also members of the Onsruur.
