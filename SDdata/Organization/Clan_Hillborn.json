        "Organization": "As of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Hillborn dwarves were led by [[Vandra Hillborn]].",
        "History": "After the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] in the {{YearlinkName|1451}}, an old [[Fireguard Fortress|dwarfhold]] was revealed within the depths of the volcano, and a number of dwarven clans took it upon themselves to investigate its origins. The Hillborn expedition ignited conflict within Mount Hotenow when they encountered the incendiary [[fire giant]] cult-leader [[Gommoth]] and his followers, the [[cult of Maegera]]. The fire-worshiping cultists scattered the dwarves, isolating some from their group, while a band of [[mind flayer]]s drove others to homicidal madness.\n\nVandra Hillborn enlisted aid from the [[Hero of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge]], an up-and-coming adventurer in the city of Neverwinter. With their aid, the dwarves were able to reunited their lost members and continue on their expedition into one of the lost homes of the dwarves."
