The '''Council of Loggers''' was a trade guild located in [[Estanil]] in the [[Hordelands]].
 
==Activities==
Made up of mill owners and representatives from companies who harvested lumber from the [[Shalhoond]], the Council of Loggers used their considerable economical leverage to control [[Abul Fiydah]], the Amir of Estanil.

Threats of strike, embargoes, and even secession were used to undermine Abul's authority.

==History==
The Council of Loggers, and Estanil along with it, was utterly destroyed several times in the past when the Caliph of [[Semphar]] tired of their threats.

==Base of Operations==
Estanil was the base of operations for the Council of Loggers.
