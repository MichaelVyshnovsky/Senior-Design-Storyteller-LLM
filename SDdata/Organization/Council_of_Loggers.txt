The Council of Loggers was a trade guild located in Estanil in the Hordelands.
Made up of mill owners and representatives from companies who harvested lumber from the Shalhoond, the Council of Loggers used their considerable economical leverage to control Abul Fiydah, the Amir of Estanil.
Threats of strike, embargoes, and even secession were used to undermine Abuls authority.
The Council of Loggers, and Estanil along with it, was utterly destroyed several times in the past when the Caliph of Semphar tired of their threats.
Estanil was the base of operations for the Council of Loggers.
