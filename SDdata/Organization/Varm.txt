The '''Varm''' were a tribe of nomads who dwelt in [[the Ride]] in the [[Moonsea North]]. They were one of several independent tribes known as the [[Horse Nomads of the Golden Steppes]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|60}}

==Activities==
The Varm were a contemplative and peaceful tribe, preferring to avoid conflict and seek peace with their neighbors. They venerated [[primal spirit]]s, practiced [[totem]] [[magic]],{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|59}}

They ranged the Ride as [[horse]]-riding nomads,{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|79}} It was said that, although they shunned the Tortured Land as a place of [[evil]], for generations they made a [[pilgrimage]] into it each [[Ches]] to venerate the spirit of a glowing spring.

==Relationships==
While the Varm were a peaceful people, they were not immune to the inter-tribal feuding of the Ride. In particular, they were aligned against the warlike [[Vaegould]] tribe.

In times of great peril and mutual threat, they were known to ally themselves with the armies or [[adventurer]]s of settled lands to defeat a common foe.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|48}}

==History==
According to Varm oral tradition, they traced their lineage directly to the ancient [[human]] culture that founded the [[Citadel of the Raven]] during the [[First Flowering]]. Scholars believed that they could also trace their ancestry to include the [[Rengarth]] tribes of [[Netheril]].{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|81}}

Some of their tribal practices were documented in ''[[The History of the North]]'', although the accuracy of its portrayal was questionable.

In the {{YearlinkName|-357}}, the Varn aligned themselves with armies from [[Horreb]], [[Flindyke]], [[Mount Akoro]], [[Barze]] and [[Forharn]] to defeat [[Maram of the Great Spear]]. This alliance was led by the [[Dark Three]] and, although it succeeded in driving back the [[primordial]], the forces suffered devastating casualties.{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|61}}

In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, the Varm's shaman&mdash;who was also their chieftain{{Cite dungeon/170/Monument of the Ancients|49}}&mdash;feared that Maram's return was at hand, and so she sought out adventurers who might be able to decipher and make use of the ''Horreb ritual cube''.
