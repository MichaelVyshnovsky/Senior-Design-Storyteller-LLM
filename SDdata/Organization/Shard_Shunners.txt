The Shard Shunners were a gang of halfling wererats operating in Waterdeep in the late 15 century DR. Their name came from their refusal to deal in silver, called shards in Waterdeep, because of their wererat nature.
The Shard Shunners committed petty crimes around the city. Around 1492 DR, they were pickpocketing patrons at the Endshift Tavern in the Field Ward as retribution for a disagreement between the tavern owner and one of their members.
They were hired by Emmek Frewn to harass a group of adventurers. The adventurers had reopened Trollskull Tavern, a bar that he had personally tried to buy but was outbid. He opened his own establishment nearby, Frewns Brews, and felt that the Tavern was too near to his own business.
The gang operated from a halfling-owned hostel on Spices Street in the Dock Ward.
There was a tenuous alliance between the Shard Shunners and the Xanathars Thieves Guild. The hostel that served as a base of operations for the Shard Shunners shared a cellar entrance to the sewers very near to one of the Xanathars underground hideouts.
