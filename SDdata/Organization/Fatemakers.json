        "mainbody": "The '''Fatemakers''' were a radical band of [[priest]]s who believed all luck [[deity|deities]] were one and the same, such as [[Tymora]], [[Beshaba]], [[Erevan Ilesere]], and so on. They also followed the philosophy that anyone could influence fate and luck in the same way as these deities. Moreover, they believed that if given enough power mortals could become their own gods. When approached for guidance, it was not unusual for Fatemakers to issue commands rather than advice in an attempt to determine the day-to-day affairs of everyone they could.{{Cite dragon/388/Channel Divinity: Tymora}}",
        "Relationships": "Many Tymorans despised the Fatemakers, rightly suspecting that many of them were corrupt and secret followers of Beshaba."
