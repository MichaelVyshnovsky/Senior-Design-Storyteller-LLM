        "mainbody": "'''House Karanok''' was the insane ruling family of the city of [[Luthcheq]] in [[Chessenta]]. They claimed to be pure-blood [[Mulan]] and descendants of the [[god]]-king [[Nanna-Sin]].{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|69}}",
        "Organization": "They believed that [[wizard]]s (including also [[sorcerer]]s, [[dwarves]], and [[elves]]) were evil and must be burned. They worshiped [[Entropy]], a strange ''[[sphere of annihilation]]''. In [[1370 DR]], [[Tiamat]] posed as Entropy and granted them clerical [[spell]]s.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|71}}",
        "Members": "In [[1357 DR]]:\n* [[Jaerios Karanok]]\n* [[Maelos Karanok]]\n* [[Naeros Karanok]]\n* [[Saestra Karanok]]\nIn [[1372 DR]]:\n* [[Kaestra Karanok]]\n* [[Povros Karanok]]\nAfter the [[Spellplague]]:\n* [[Ishual Karanok]]\n* [[Shala Karanok]]",
        "History": "The Karanoks became the rulers of Luthcheq under suspicious circumstances in the {{YearlinkName|1161}}. Initially, they ruled in a typical Chessentan style.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1324}}, however, Luthcheq was defeated in a war against [[Mordulkin]] and the Karanoks blamed wizard spies for their loss. With this, they started their crusade against [[arcane]] [[magic]].\n\nThen, in the {{YearlinkName|1346}}, from nowhere, Entropy manifested itself inside House Karanok's mansion, killing a wizard they were torturing. The Karanoks saw this as an omen and began worshiping it.\n\n[[Tiamat]] started granting clerical powers to the Karanoks in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, in order to manipulate them.\n\nThen everything changed after [[Tchazzar]] disappeared in the chaos of the [[Spellplague]] in the {{YearlinkName|1385}}. Ishual Karanok emerged as a war hero and leader who united the divided survivors of Luthcheq. He went on to battle rampaging monsters, [[aberration]]s sent by the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]], and opportunistic invaders and colonists from northern lands, and so kept Chessenta alive.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|70}} In the {{YearlinkName|1399}}, Ishual Karanok merged the different coinages of the city-states of Chessenta into a single currency.{{Cite dungeon/178/Backdrop: Chessenta|69}} After a time, when the fighting had lessened, he returned to Luthcheq and the Karanok family home. There, Ishual disbanded his family's cult, arguing that their goal of destroying all arcane [[magic]] and its users had been achieved with [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra's]] death. Nevertheless, he kept their god Entropy as a symbol of power.\n\nIn [[1479 DR]], the ruler [[Shala Karanok]] was ousted from power for a brief time by the returned Tchazzar. However, after the [[Battle of Luthcheq]], she regained control over the city."
