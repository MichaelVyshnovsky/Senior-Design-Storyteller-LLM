They ranged from simple shrines, such as those in the [[Dalelands]] and oft in the wilderness, to amazing opulent temples like the House of the Moon in Waterdeep. There were also humble hermitages, hilltop circles in which worshipers danced in the night, and ornate temple mansions, which were huge edifices with open-air courtyards or great skylights.

        "Dogma": {
            "Terminology": "Selûnites had their own terms for night-time conditions. When the moon was out, even if not visible, it was known as \"moonlight\". When the moon was dark or not out, it was known as \"nightgloom\"."
        },
        "Activities": "There were broadly two kinds of Selûnite clergy: those who remained at the temples (often but not necessarily due to age or infirmity), and those who wandered [[Faerûn]]. Their duties were similar but distinct.\n\nTemple priests provided healing to the community and tended to the residents of asylums and sanitariums, which often adjoined their temples. As the goddess bade them, they were generous with their healing magic and charged very little for it. Instead, the temple priests made good money by practicing [[astrology]] and telling fortunes. With divine guidance, they were more successful than ordinary folk.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = May Selûne guide your steps in the night, and bring them to the new dawn.\n| source = A common blessing by priests to the faithful.\n| float  = \n| width  = \n}}\nItinerant priests spread the faith by seeking out and keeping in touch with both existing and potential worshipers, in the belief that Selûne could be worshiped anywhere. Such priests also provided healing, usually asking for nothing more than a meal and a warm place to rest. They practiced humility and self-reliance. These habits kept the clergy well-traveled, resilient, and in touch with the natural world in a practical manner.\n\nWandering priests also kept watch for people afflicted with madness or lycanthropy. They would heal or help them if they could, or else escort them to the closest Selûnite temple, where senior clerics could aid them. Both kinds of priests were united in opposing evil lycanthropes when they threatened a community. They were fearless and did all they could to uncover, cure, or eliminate the affliction of lycanthropy. Such struggles won them the respect of farmers and the common people.\n\nIn Durpar in the Shining Lands, almost all marriages were conducted by priests of Lucha, as it was believed that the goddess watched over all marriages performed by her priests.",
        "Organization": {
            "Membership": "With the faith of Selûne promoting equality and understanding for all, and with her wide assortment of worshipers, her priesthood were just as diverse and eclectic.",
            "Hierarchy": "Suiting the goddess's chaotic and changeable ways, the church hierarchy was highly variable, shifting from place to place and even with the predictable phase of the moon and other, unpredictable heavenly events. It was a jumble of clerics and specialty priests, crusaders and mystics, and blessed or well-informed lay worshipers. The silverstar specialty priests were elite members of the church.",
            "Titles": "The clergy of Selûne were known collectively as \"Selûnites\", which was also the adjective for the faith.\n\nThe clergy held a wide assortment of titles. Novices were always known as the Called, while a full priest was known as Priestess or Priest, typically prefaced by Touched, Enstarred, Moonbathed, Silverbrow, Lunar, Initiate, and High Initiate, in order of increasing rank. Higher-ranked clergy were instead known as \"Priestess/Priest of the…\" followed by a term traditional to the shrine or temple with which the priest was affiliated. For example, Priestess of the High Moonlight [[Naneatha Suaril]] was high priestess of the House of the Moon in Waterdeep. Such was the case in the time of Netheril and in the great temples of cities like Waterdeep in the 14{{th}} century DR, but there were many variations at country shrines and temples and in other lands.\n\nThe [[specialty priest]]s were called [[silverstar]]s, in both the time of Netheril and in the 14{{th}} century DR.",
            "Classes": "The church of Selûne commonly included among its ranks [[cleric]]s, the elite [[specialty priest]]s known as [[silverstar]]s, [[crusader]]s, and [[mystic]]s. Other clergy could be [[druid]]s and [[ranger]]s. There were also a number of lay worshipers who could not cast spells and had no special talents.\n\nIn the time of Netheril, all clergy were good-aligned, but by the 14{{th}} century DR they widened to include neutral members. After 1372 DR, clerics were [[chaotic good]] or similar.",
            "Orders": "[[File:Moon knight.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''A moon knight out on a moonlit night.'']]\nThe church of Selûne was associated with a number of religious orders:\n* The [[Knights of the Half Moon]]: An order of [[crusader]]s who defended the House of the Moon in Waterdeep.\n* [[Swords of the Lady]]: A fanatical order, nicknamed the Lunatics, who reacted swiftly to threats from Shar.\n* [[Oracles of the Moon]]: A group of female [[diviner]]s who worshiped the Night White Lady.\n* The [[Silver Path]]: A group of [[ranger]]s active in the time of Netheril.\n* The [[Guardians of Light]]: An elite order of [[paladin]]s active in the time of Netheril.\n* The [[Sun Soul]]: A [[monk]] order dedicated variously to Selûne, [[Sune]], and [[Lathander]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|7}}\n* The [[moon knights]]: A militant order of soldier-priests.\n* The [[silver ladies]]: An order of female healers, diviners, and protectors of women and lycanthropes.\nThe church was also affiliated with the [[Harpers]]."
        },
        "Rituals": "[[File:Moonfire ritual.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''A full night stalk ceremony held beneath the full moon, with the appearance of ''moonfire''.'']]\nThe diverse faithful all paid homage to Selûne in their own individual ways, often adapting the standard rituals into very personalized, even unique rites.\n\nClerics prayed for their [[spell]]s at night while facing the moon, if it was out and visible.\n\nDuring the full moon, a female cleric would perform morning ceremonies to make herself receptive to special insights, intuition, and visions. This was in the belief that the moon subtly influenced the cycles of the female body, and thus she felt closest to Selûne during the full moon.\n\nA regular ritual was the \"night stalk\", as it was often known, an occasion for worship and communion with the goddess, in which the clergy reaffirmed their nearness to the Night White Lady.The \"night stalk\" changed from a \"solitary moonlit walk\" (where the name is more fitting) in the ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]'' to open-air dances and libations in ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' and later sources. It is unclear if these are meant to be the same or alternative \"night stalk\" ceremonies. It should be noted that, at the new moon, the moon is not seen and hence there is no (natural) moonlight for such ceremonies. For example, High Initiate [[Courynna Jacerryl]] would pour milk and wine over a [[moonstone]]-inlaid altar, then dance while chanting a prayer. She would be mimicked by junior clerics, who felt honored to participate. They could even dance until they collapsed in exhaustion.\n\n{{fq\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| source = High Initiate Courynna Jacerryl, upon receiving ''moonfire''\n| text   = It is a blessed night, and a good sign for you all, that Our Lady of Silver considers you worthy to see her gift.}}\nIf the goddess was pleased by a ceremony, she bathed the milk or wine poured on the altar with moonlight, transforming it into a holy substance known as ''[[moonfire]]''. This crept away from the altar to touch or envelop whatever the goddess chose, in turn enchanting items, empowering the faithful, and destroying [[undead]].''[[Magic of Faerûn]]'', page 17, has the Mystery of the Night ritual be a precursor to producing ''moonfire''. However, while the prior sources discuss ''moonfire'' immediately after the Mystery of the Night, it is not necessarily the case that the Mystery produces ''moonfire''. Instead, the conditions described for creating ''moonfire'' are the same as those of the night stalk. With both in mind, this article treats ''moonfire'' as potentially being produced from any ritual.\n\nThe most sacred rituals, observed by all clergy, were the Mystery of the Night, an annual holy day, and the rare Conjuring of the Second Moon.\n\nThe Mystery of the Night was the most sacred ritual; every priest was required to perform it at least once a year. The priests cast certain secret spells then prostrated themselves before an altar, where they fell into a deep trance. Then they flew upwards, to spiral around the night sky and even to circle the moon. Meanwhile, they communed and communicated personally with Selûne through mental visions. This was draining and injurious, but easily healed with time or magic.<ref group=\"note\">''Magic of Faerûn'', page 17, merges the night stalk and the Mystery of the Night rituals, essentially renaming the night stalk as the Mystery of the Night. This article separates the two for clarity and treats the described ritual as a night stalk.\n\nThe Conjuring of the Second Moon was conducted only on [[Shieldmeet]], a day that occurred once every four years. Every Shieldmeet, at every temple to Selûne in Faerûn, the clergy chanted in coordination and the confluence of their devotional energy summoned the [[Shards]], the [[planetar]] servants of the goddess. For one night only, the Shards would do as the clergy bade them, most often to combat the minions and dark forces of [[Shar]]. However, at dawn the next day, the Shards elevated one mortal priestess to their ranks, before they departed for the [[planes]].''[[Netheril: Empire of Magic]]'' reprints Selûne's write-up in ''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'', copying the Mystery of the Night but neglecting the Conjuring of the Second Moon. This suggests the Conjuring of the Second Moon was introduced sometime after the [[Fall of Netheril]].",

        "Symbol": "[[File:Selune symbol 4e.jpg|thumb|right|''The holy symbol of Selûne in the form of a silver pendant.'']]\nThe symbol of the church was the [[holy symbol]] of the goddess: a pair of eyes, of a darkly beautiful human woman, encircled by seven silver stars. This was typically carved into or out of moonstone and fashioned into an item of jewelry.",
        "Possessions": {
            "Dress": "The original ceremonial dress of the priests of Selûne during the time of Netheril consisted of white robes, which could be either plain and unadorned or embroidered with [[silver]] and decorated with moonstones; a circlet of woven flowers or vines worn around the head; and no shoes. A high priest carried as their symbol of office a wooden staff wrapped with silver, including silver flowers and vines, and topped with a moonstone.\n\n[[File:Priest-Selune.png|thumb|right|''A cleric of Selûne in formal blue-and-white dress with high collar and headpiece.'']]\nMeanwhile, the later priests of Selûne had highly variable ceremonial costumes. The most humble wore plain brown robes, while others wore normal clothes accented with but a little moonstone jewelry. The grandest and haughtiest wore only the very finest attire, such as expensive gowns bedecked with jewels, with magical and animated capes and trains, and crowns set with moonstones. For example, Naneatha Suaril, high priestess of the House of the Moon in Waterdeep, presided over ceremonies in a majestic dress with a wide-bottomed hooped skirt and a great fan-like collar ascending from the back of her neck, both stiffened with [[whale]]bone, all set with clusters of [[pearl]]s and other precious stones.\n\nIn everyday life, Selûnites wore fashionable but not gaudy attire. In their work, they adopted whatever was practical for the task at hand.",
            "Weapons": "In battle, Selûnites preferred a certain kind of [[mace]] they called \"the [[Moon's Hand]]\". A Moon's Hand had a smooth head representing the moon in a specific phase. Each temple had its own preferred phase for their Moon's Hands. It was otherwise identical to a typical [[footman's mace]], [[light mace]], or [[heavy mace]], with the clergy favoring the heavy mace."

These included:\n* ''[[Amulet of Selûne's chosen]]''\n* ''[[Moon bracers]]'',\n* ''[[Mooncloak]]'',\n* ''[[Moonfire salve]]''\n* ''[[Moon mote]]'',\n* ''[[Moondraught]]'',\n* ''[[Ring of shooting stars]]'',\n* ''[[Staff of the Moonmaiden]]''",

Hence, the church of Selûne had been war with the [[church of Shar]] since their beginnings. When followers of each faith encountered one another, open battle invariably broke out.<ref>\n\nMost good folk of Faerûn respected the Selûnite clergy, though few understood the details of the faith. Common people saw them as mysterious, but knew them as a force of good and foes of werebeasts and undead, and as caretakers of the ill and the mad.\n\nIn Durpar, the clergy of Lucha enjoyed the worship of almost everyone in the land.

            "Recent History": "Following the [[Godswar]] of 1358 DR, with her waxing faith, theologians of the 1360s DR predicted Selûne would once again be elevated among the gods, possibly within their own lifetimes.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Time of Troubles, the clergy grew in strength. To atone for being tricked by Shar, Naneatha launched a crusade against Shar's followers and drove them out of the city by [[1372 DR]]. Naneatha also firmly supported the establishment of the [[Order of the Blue Moon]], dedicated to both Selûne and [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]].\n\nAfter the [[Spellplague]] happened in the [[1385 DR|Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR]], Selûne became a popular deity across Faerûn, as her priesthood made pilgrimages to every corner of the continent, wanting to bring hope to people in those desperate times.{{Cite dungeon/193/Shards of Selûne|21}}"
