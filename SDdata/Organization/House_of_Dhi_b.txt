==Organization==
Four thousand [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] formed the House of Dhi'b. Many of these men and women were craftsmen and herders, but plenty of strong warriors were also among their ranks. Several clans from the tribe, numbering around 200 members each, raided caravans traveling through the south and south-central regions of the desert.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p37-38"/>

==Activities==
Warriors of the House of Dhi'b rode with [[Kori al-Zafiri]] against the sultan of [[Tajar]] and deposed him.<ref name=LoF:AGtZ-p37-38"/>
