        "mainbody": "The '''Valiant Warriors''' were a long-standing adventuring company based in [[Telflamm]].",
        "Activities": "The Valiant Warriors usually protected commerce in the lands east and north of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] from [[Rashemen]]'s borders to [[Damara]]. However, they were no longer welcomed in [[Impiltur]] for their run-ins with authorities there. They always followed the dogma of [[Tymora]] to live dangerously. However, in time, they also invested their money in a merchant fleet on the Inner Sea.",
        "History": "The Valiant Warriors had a very large number of heroic exploits to tell: they seized an entire [[duergar]] town, saved a Rashemi [[Witches of Rashemen|witch]] from forty [[ogre]]s, and defeated a pirate ship just after it had raided the Telflamm port.\n\nAround [[1357 DR]], some of their female retired members had become ladies in Telflamm."
