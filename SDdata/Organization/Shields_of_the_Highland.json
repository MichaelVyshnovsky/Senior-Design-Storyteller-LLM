        "mainbody": "The Shields of the Highland were a mildly famous adventuring company working in the Upper Highlands in Tethyr in 1370 DR.\nThe Shields of the Highlands were a group of six friends hailing from near the Forest of Mir. They were led by Roalgan, the largest of their number.\nThe group sought fortune and fame fighting against monsters in the hills of the Golden Marches in Tethyr.\nThe Shields operated in the Upper Highlands and nearby areas and were known to the people of Survale Ford, Toralth, and Trailstone.\nFive of the groups six members were\n* Roalgan, the leader\n* Timor the \"Scar\"\n* Dumax\n* Karr and\n* Vajal the Dark.\nOn Uktar 8, 1370 DR, they lost two of their members&mdashTimors younger brother Dumax and one other companion&mdashwhile guarding a caravan. Unexpected cold weather led to snow, and a band of fourteen gnolls were able to track them and attack them, killing two of them during the ensuing battle.\nAt dusk two days later, the four survivors went to the Blue Badger Inn in the village of Toralth to grieve their loss.\nLater that night, three dwarves, Bapar Ghalmrin, Odak Truesteel, and Soram Battlebellow, entered the tavern seeking the Sondarr Scepter and interrupting the ballad that Fylson was singing for Dumax. This greatly angered the Shields of the Highland. When Bramas Thorntree, another patron, accused some of the other patrons of stealing the scepter, Timor, Karr, and Vajal got up from their chairs and began throwing their beer mugs and swinging their chairs. The mug thrown by Timor struck the dwarf leader Bapar, and a tavern brawl was started when Soram stepped up to defend his prince. Bramas and his companions, the Company of the Anvil used this as an opportunity to escape with the scepter."
