        "mainbody": "At dusk two days later, the four survivors went to the [[Blue Badger Inn]] in the village of Toralth to grieve their loss.\n\nLater that night, three [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Bapar Ghalmrin]], [[Odak Truesteel]], and [[Soram Battlebellow]], entered the tavern seeking the ''[[Sondarr Scepter]]'' and interrupting the ballad that Fylson was singing for Dumax. This greatly angered the Shields of the Highland. When [[Bramas Thorntree]], another patron, accused some of the other patrons of stealing the ''scepter'', Timor, Karr, and Vajal got up from their chairs and began throwing their beer [[mug]]s and swinging their chairs. The mug thrown by Timor struck the dwarf leader Bapar, and a tavern brawl was started when Soram stepped up to defend his prince.

Unexpected cold weather led to snow, and a band of fourteen [[gnoll]]s were able to track them and attack them, killing two of them during the ensuing battle.\n{{fq\n| float  = right\n| width  = 300px\n| source = [[Timor]] the \"Scar\"\n| text   = &hellip;''Three'' [[gnoll]]s it took, didyeheerme, bard?
