'''Parhek''' was the last and least fortunate ruling dynasty of [[Amn]], which lasted merely from [[1237 DR]] to [[1276 DR]].

==History==
The family came to prominence in the {{YearlinkName|1237}} when King [[Belhinn Wavegold II]] died fighting the [[Black Horde]]. The crown passed through his only child [[Peldara Wavegold|Peldara]] to her husband [[Malek Parhek]], making him the first king of the new dynasty. The new royal family had a brief and unfortunate existence as misfortune and conspiracy bedevilled them. Mercantile powers grew in strength under their reign, continually subverting and stressing the realm, and each king had but a short reign before they died young.

The situation came to a head in the {{YearlinkName|1276}} when King [[Dhanar Parhek|Dhanar]] was assassinated by the agents of ambitious merchants and the realm collapsed into civil war. His children were scattered to protect them, but Prince [[Dhanar Parhek (prince)|Dhanar]] was assassinated in [[Tethyr]] by the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]], Princess [[Rasa Parhek|Rasa]] was tracked down in [[Silverymoon]] by Amnian agents, and Prince [[Malek Parhek (prince)|Malek]] was finally located in [[Waterdeep]]. The final Parhek died in [[1306 DR]] at the hands of the manipulator [[Arlen Bormul]], who poisoned Prince [[Rohav Steelsar|Rohav]] after exhausting his usefulness as a tool.

The period of Amn's internal conflict only ended in [[1333 DR]], when [[Thayze Selemchant]] halted the [[Great Amnian Trade War]] and unified the land under the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]].
