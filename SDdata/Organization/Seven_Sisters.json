        "Sisters": "* [[Anastra Syluné Silverhand]], more commonly known as \"Syluné\", the [[Neutral good|kindly]] Witch of [[Shadowdale]], who was slain in [[1356 DR]] by a [[red dragon]] but remained in [[Faerûn]] as a ghostly [[spectral harpist]]. She continued to exist in [[1491 DR]] as a [[Weaveghost]]. Her husband was [[Aumry Obarskyr]] the Lord of Shadowdale until his death in [[1339 DR]].\n* [[Alustriel Silverhand]] (\"Endué Alustriel Silverhand\" was her birth name), the regal but unashamed Lady of [[Silverymoon]], founder of the nation of the [[Silver Marches]]. She was renowned for her many children (The [[Tall Ones]], etc) from different fathers.\n* [[Dove Falconhand]] (\"Ambara Dove Silverhand\" was her birth name), whose magic was second to her skill at arms, for she was a ranger and a renowned [[Knights of Myth Drannor|Knight of Myth Drannor]] married to another Knight, [[Florin Falconhand]]. She was the mother of [[Azalar Falconhand]]. She died from her battle wounds against the dying [[Vattick Tanthul]] in [[1487 DR]] and later existed as a Weaveghost alongside her sister Anastra and Qilué.\n* [[Storm Silverhand]] (\"Ethena Astorma Silverhand\" was her birth name), a famous and much-loved [[Harper]], [[sorceress]], and Bard of Shadowdale, who, despite sometimes appearing flighty, Her consort was [[Maxan Maxer]].\n* [[Laeral Silverhand|Laeral Silverhand Arunsun]] (\"Anamanué Laeral Silverhand\" was her birth name), the radiant and good-hearted Lady of [[Waterdeep]], who married the great [[wizard]] [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] and with him led the secretive organization known as [[the Moonstars]] (who were once Harpers).\n* [[The Simbul]] (\"Alassra Shentrantra Silverhand\" was her birth name, but few knew it and fewer used it) was the Witch Queen of the eastern kingdom of [[Aglarond]], former lover of [[Elminster]] and once the most powerful [[Sorcerer|sorceress]] in all Faerûn—her kingdom stayed intact only because of the might she could bring against the nefarious [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] and their [[zulkirs]].\n* [[Qilué Veladorn]], the youngest daughter, was not widely known like her sisters—when she was whispered of she was called \"The Dark Sister\"—and that was probably a good thing for she was a [[drow]] (born to Mystra in exceptionally odd circumstances), but also a fair and mighty priestess of both Mystra and the good drow goddess [[Eilistraee]]. She was slain by the Lady Penitent, [[Halisstra Melarn]], in [[1379 DR]], and became a Weaveghost as a result.",
        "Chosen of Mystra": "As the Chosen of Mystra, each sister is gifted with a special power.\n\n* Syluné: Unknown.\n* Alustriel: Spellcast.\n* Dove: Magic Arms (armor and weapons).\n* Storm: Immunity to all forms of natural electricity, but will physically recover instead if hit.\n* Laeral: Magic Items.\n* The Simbul: Unknown.\n* Qilué: Dual Chosen of Mystra and Eilistraee.",
        "History": "After Elué died in the {{YearlinkName|767}}, Dornal abandoned his daughters and they were cared for by various foster parents. Their father later died and became '''The Watcher''' of the [[Weave]].\n\nDuring the [[Second Sundering]] in the 1480s [[DR]], five of the Seven Sisters vanished and were presumed deceased. Storm and Dove remained, but much diminished in magical power and living under assumed names. In the {{YearlinkName|1487}}, Laeral and Alustriel came out of hiding to assist Elminster in securing Mystra's [[Weave]] and stopped [[Shar]]'s quest to seize dominance over [[magic]] from Mystra.<ref>{{Page needed}}",
