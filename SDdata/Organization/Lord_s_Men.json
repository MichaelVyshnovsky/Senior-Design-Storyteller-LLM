        "mainbody": "The '''Lord's Men''' were the standing army of the town of [[Llorkh]] in the [[Savage Frontier]] in the mid–14th century [[DR]]. They were a subset of the [[Zhentilar]].",
        "History": "Shortly before [[1357 DR]],<ref group=\"note\">The date of this unknown. ''[[Waterdeep and the North]]'' (dated [[1357 DR]]) only says this was \"recently\", implying sometime in 1357 DR or shortly before. following the murder of Lord [[Phintarn|Phintarn \"Redblade\"]], the mage [[Geildarr Ithym]] seized the [[Lord's Keep]] in [[Llorkh]] and claimed the throne. Soon after, four hundred \"Lord's Men\" arrived and in a handful of battles slaughtered all of the existing militia under the pretext that they were trouble-makers. The citizens found themselves under the \"protection\" of the Lord's Men. Thus, Llorkh was quickly and quietly conquered by the [[Zhentarim]] and under the control of their puppet.\n\nBy 1357 DR, the fiendish forces of [[Hellgate Keep]] advanced on newly conquered Llorkh. The Lord's Men met them on the banks of the [[Delimbiyr]] river above [[Shining Falls]]. They fought a major battle, but beat the [[demon]]s back.\n\nOne night in [[Uktar]] of the [[1358 DR|Year of Shadows, 1358 DR]], a Zhentarim caravan was secretly transporting a menagerie of monsters in locked wagons for unknown reasons on a journey to the south. One night, a number of monsters escaped and roamed the streets before the Lord's Men came to deal with them. Daylight found thirty monster [[zombie]]s, [[undead]] [[ogre]]s, [[bugbear]]s, and [[minotaur]]s destroyed and ten soldiers and civilians killed.",
        "Activities": "The Lord's Men were commanded by Lord Geildarr himself.\n\nThe duty of the Lord's Men was to defend the town of Llorkh, both against [[orc]] raids and incursions by the [[fiend]]s of [[Hellgate Keep]]. It was also their duty to defend the Lord against adventurers and townsfolk and enforce his will, as he and the Zhents were not at all liked. Thus enjoying the \"protection\" of the Lord's Men was no more than a euphemism.\n\nA garrison of thirty Lord's Men stood guard at [[Dawn Pass]] in the [[Greypeak Mountains]], through which Zhentarim caravans regularly passed.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Lord's Men were likely headquartered in the Lord's Keep in Llorkh.{{speculation}}\n\nThey commandeered three worked-out mine tunnels near Llorkh to use for storage.",
        "Possessions": "Each solder was fully armed and armored, equipped with a [[shield]] and protected by [[chainmail]]. They were recognized by their purple cloaks.",
        "Members": "From 1357 DR and through to [[1370 DR]], the Lord's Men comprised nearly 400 men-at-arms, all of them battle-hardened veterans. They were of course composed of and reinforced by Zhentilar soldiers, the army of [[Zhentil Keep]]. However, by [[1372 DR]], they numbered just 300.",
        "Relationships": "The soldiers were loyal to Lord Geildarr and to the [[Zhentarim]].The ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 3rd edition]]'' page 169 reduces the number of Lord's Men from 400 to 300 without explanation. It may be that the previously disguised Zhentilar in the Lord's Men are now openly Zhentilar, as part of the Zhents' more overt rule."
