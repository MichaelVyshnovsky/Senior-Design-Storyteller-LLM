'''Clan Shestandeliath''' was one of the [[dragonborn]] [[Thymari#Clans|clans]] of the nation of [[Tymanther]].

==Description==
Members of Clan Shestandeliath used [[silver]] chains from the left nostril to the frill along the left ear, as their distinctive clan piercings.

==Background==
Clan Shestandeliath was one of the farming clans of Tymanther. They also were known for breeding the Ishen-Charac, a Tymantheran breed of [[horse|warhorses]]. Their lands were located to the northeast of Tymanther, near the [[Riders to the Sky]].

==Relationships==
Clans Shestandeliath and [[Clan Verthisathurgiesh|Verthisathurgiesh]] were traditional allies since the foundation of Tymanchebar. This changed, however, in the late years of the 15{{Th}} century [[DR]], as relationships soured between the clans thanks to the actions of [[Verthisathurgiesh Pandjed]].

By [[1486 DR]], clan Shestandeliath was an ally of [[Clan Kepeshkmolik]].

==History==
Clan Shestandeliath was one of the oldest [[Thymari]] clans, dating back to the foundation of [[Tymanchebar]]. Clan Shestandeliath was the clan in charge of safekeeping the powerful [[artifact]] known as the [[Breath of Petron]]. 

During the [[Second Sundering]], Clan Shestandeliath lost a third of their number when [[Abeir]] and [[Toril]] exchanged lands, and most of their members were captured by the returned [[Unther]]ans to be their slaves. Thanks to the efforts of [[Dahl Peredur]], [[Mira Zawad]], and [[Namshita]], most members of Clan Shestandeliath were rescued, and returned to Tymanther.
