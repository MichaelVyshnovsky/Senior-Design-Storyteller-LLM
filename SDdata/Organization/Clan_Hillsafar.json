        "mainbody": "Clan Hillsafar was a venerable dwarven clan based in Vaasa and renowned across northern Faer√ªn. They were the largest dwarf clan in the Bloodstone Lands.\nThe clan operated their mines nonstop, working in shifts so as to maximize their lucrative operation extracting bloodstone and copper. Their miners worked under the constant risk of unearthing the lairs of underground monsters.\nBeing all too familiar with the dangers of Vaasa, the clan maintained constant vigilance and military preparedness. or the Wandering Pit.\nClan Hillsafar lived and worked in their mines beneath the Galena Mountains in the Sunderland region of Vaasa, about  south of Bloodstone Pass. The entrance to their mines was guarded by Hillsafar Hall, perhaps the greatest fortress in the Bloodstone Lands, and between 50 and 100 soldiers were always alert and on duty. \nAs of the mid-to-late 14 century DR, Clan Hillsafar was close allies of the Thunkers of the Thunkers and Clan Orothiar of Bloodstone Mines. and the dwarves occasionally hosted Weird Winghams Wacky Weapon Wielders.\nThey had a chilly relationship with the half-orcs of Palischuk, at least in the early days following that towns refounding. They were enemies of the Warlock Knights of Vaasa.\nThe Clan traced its history back to the ancient dwarven realm of Sarphil beneath the mountains of the eastern Moonsea region. They were at the forefront of the expansion of Sarphils tunnels and mines to beneath the southern shore of the Moonsea, where they encroached beneath the lands of the Elven Court of Cormanthor. Most notably, Clan Hillsafar served as the principle miners of a copper-rich escarpment above the Tailings Bay north of Elventree.\nWhile some Hillsafar dwarves would go on to settle in the North,\nthe clan itself persisted in the mountains north and east of the Moonsea. After the fall of Sarphil to drow and duergar invaders in , the dwarven clans of that realm fled north into the West Galena and Dragonspine Mountains, and Clan Hillsafar would reemerge millennia later in the Galenas. After the , when the Great Glacier began to melt and to free the land of Vaasa from its ice, the dwarves were among the first folk to settle there. Clan Hillsafar claimed for themselves caverns below the Galenas, where they fell in love with the pure stone and the fabulously rich mines. They constructed the mighty fortress of Hillsafar Hall to defend this new home.\nAs of the mid&ndash14 century DR, the clan was led by King Garumbelly Hillsafar, who was an important ally for the aspiring King Gareth Dragonsbane of Bloodstone. At the same time, they were known to trade over the mountains directly to the Moonsea was well.\nOver a century later in the , the Warlock Knights invaded Hillsafar Hall, and were only driven back after Garumbellys third son, Borigon, took up the crown. King Borigon then brought together other dwarven clans who were displaced by the Knights, including Clan Orothiar&mdashwho were forced to abandon Bloodstone Mines&mdashand then sealed the gates of Hillsafar Hall. This left the clan completely shut off from the outside world for over a decade. In the , they began working to help Clan Orothiar retake Bloodstone Mines.\nAs of the mid&ndash14 century DR, the clan was 2,000 dwarves strong, although it had shrunk to 1,500 by the . They worshiped Moradin.\nThe dwarves of Hillsafar were both miners and fighters, and always kept their arms and armor close at hand. Even the youngest among their warriors were fearsome foes. The clan counted Bloodstone Runehammers among their ranks, mighty warlords who were sworn to defend dwarven homes from monster attacks.\nDuring the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the clan was led by the legendary King Garumbelly \"Grumble\" Hillsafar, a gruff and direct dwarf who was nevertheless a kind and caring leader. In the late 15 century DR, it was led by Garumbellys third son, King Borigon Hillsafar."
