The Tamer Creed was one of the major illithid Creeds in the Realms. They were highly militaristic, and favored the use of martial might against other races.
In Oryndoll, illithids in the Tamer Creed controlled most of the citys martial, non-psionic forces. Their influence in the city diminished after the Mindstalker Wars. They still however partnered closely with the Nourisher Creed to launch raids on the lizardfolk city of Surkh. The Nourishers turned the lizardfolk captured into tzakandi for the Tamers. They held influence over the branch of the military called the Errant Thoughts.
They had control of the Armories of the city.
