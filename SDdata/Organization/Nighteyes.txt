The Nighteyes was a prominent thieves guild located in Calimport some time before the 14 century DR.
The guild was run by Nelazra, the guildmaster, and her lieutenant Shadowhands.
The Nighteyes were eventually slain to a man by the Brothers Six, a group of mages who wished to control all trade in Calimport and wanted to eliminate their competition.
