They spent a decade and a half recruiting and training kobolds, goblins, ogres, hill giants, and hobgoblins from the dreaded Underdark.\nSythillis started assembling his so-called empire in the . For the next fourteen years, the Sythillisian Empire swole in numbers and continuously trained for war. When internal conflicts weakened the nation of Amn in the , Sythillis and his wife Cyrvisnea gave the word to attack.\nThe ogre mages devised a plan to wait until armies of Amn move past the Small Teeth towards a distraction of Hillfort Torbold. When exposed and distracted, the Sythillisian Empire planned to attack Hillfort Ishla and eventually â€“ Esmeltaran. With the towns captured, the next step of the plan was to hold the position while the main forces of the empire moved to its true target, Murann, and its gold.\nThe armies were split into two parts, each led by one of the orge mage spouses. One part ransacked towns of Imnescar and Trademeet, looting new arms and gear, and subsequently marching against Murann, laying siege, and later, ransacking the settlement. Ogre mage Cyrvisnea negotiated a five-year alliance with the Black Alaric, leader of an outlaw fleet, to provide ransacked Muran with defenses against the empires enemies."
