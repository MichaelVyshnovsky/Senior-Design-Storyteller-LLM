The '''Shadowmasters of Telflamm''' were a religious thieves' [[guild]] that operates throughout the [[East Faerûn|eastern lands]] of [[Faerûn]]. Their headquarters were located in [[Telflamm]],  where they rule the city in all but name. While they were dedicated to the deity [[Mask]] for many years, sometime after the [[Spellplague]] they shifted their devotion to the goddess [[Shar]].

==Relations==
The guild maintained a strong alliance with the [[House of the Master's Shadow (Telflamm)|House of the Master's Shadow]], the largest temple of Mask, throughout the 14{{th}} century.

==History==
The guild has operated within Telflamm since the year [[927 DR]]. While their power and influence have grown and diminished throughout the years, they have greatly affected the course of the city's development. For example, the guild's "snub" of the [[Hierarch]] prevented Telflamm from joining the larger nation of [[Thesk]].

In [[1339 DR]], the cunning [[thief]], and former priest of Mask, [[Volludan]] ascended as guildmaster renamed the organization in honor of their deity. Over the next 15 years the newly-dubbed ''Shadowmasters'' manipulated events within Telflamm that led to dominant control over the city's crime. Through Volludan's schemes and machinations they expanded their economic holdings and became so powerful as to rival the city's nobility and religious institutions.

==Notable members==
