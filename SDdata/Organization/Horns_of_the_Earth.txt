The '''Horns of the Earth''', or the '''Darkwings''', was a large group of [[gargoyle]]s within the [[Sevenfold Mazework]] and the [[Great Dismal Delve]].
 
==Organization==
The exact numbers of gargoyles within the Horns of the Earth remained unknown. Estimates placed the numbers between 15,000 and 25,000.

==Activities==
These gargoyles patrolled the entire expanse of the Great Dismal Delve. They typically metted out justice to non-[[genie]] slaves and workers, but would occasionally apprehend common [[dao]] who broke the [[Kabril Ali al-Sara al-Zalazil|Khan's]] laws.

==Base of Operations==
The Sevenfold Mazework within the Great Dismal Delve served as base of all dao military organizations.
