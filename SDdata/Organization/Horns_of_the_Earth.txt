The Horns of the Earth, or the Darkwings, was a large group of gargoyles within the Sevenfold Mazework and the Great Dismal Delve.
The exact numbers of gargoyles within the Horns of the Earth remained unknown. Estimates placed the numbers between 15,000 and 25,000.
These gargoyles patrolled the entire expanse of the Great Dismal Delve. They typically metted out justice to non-genie slaves and workers, but would occasionally apprehend common dao who broke the Khans laws.
The Sevenfold Mazework within the Great Dismal Delve served as base of all dao military organizations.
