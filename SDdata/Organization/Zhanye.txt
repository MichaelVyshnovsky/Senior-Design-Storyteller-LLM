The '''Zhanye''' family of [[Athkatla]] was a wealthy and an influential [[Amn]]ian house in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Zhanye was renowned for its [[gem]] merchant business, and took on apprentices from outside of the family. One of them was [[Jared Blevyn]], who traveled and purchased [[diamond]]s on behalf of House Zhanye before parting ways with the family. By the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], Jared had built his own map-making business [[Blevynsoar House]] using the knowledge he'd acquired from his busy travels for the Zhanyes.
