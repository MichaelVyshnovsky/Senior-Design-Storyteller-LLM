House '''Eltorchul''' ({{Pronounce|el|TOR|chul|refs=}}) was a [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble family]] of [[Waterdeep]]. They were originally known for spice and imports but were later known for arcane research and schooling as well as the procurement of rare magical components.{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|3}}  

==Base of Operations==
[[File:CoSW-TempleOfBeauty.png|thumb|right|270px|''Map showing location of the Eltorchul villa (labeled <code>$22</code>) ''circa'' 1372 DR.'']]
The family owned [[Eltorchul Villa|a villa]] in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] on the southwest corner of [[Ivory Street]] and [[Diamond Street]], which also faced [[Torch Lane]] and [[Pharra's Alley]]. It was from there that they also ran an arcane academy aptly named the [[Eltorchul Academy]].

==History==
Lord [[Thesp Eltorchul]] invested the family's spice and import fortune into the founding of the Eltorchul Academy around [[1342 DR]].

Some of the Eltorchul sons were known for adventuring. They discovered a two-way ''[[gate]]'' into [[Undermountain]]. They sold the knowledge of the location of the gate to Lord [[Hund Hiilgauntlet]] for the erection of his tomb in Undermountain itself. Upon completion of the tomb, Hund trapped the workers and one of the Eltorchul sons within the tomb in order to keep its secret and to serve as [[undead]] guardians. Infuriated, the remaining brothers looted the Hiilgauntlet estate after a failed attempt at attacking the underground lair. They also destroyed the gate, trapping Hund in his tomb. Ironically, one of the brothers ended up marrying Hund's daughter and having many children by her.

The Eltorchul link to Undermountain continued when Thesp's daughter, [[Errya Eltorchul]], became one of [[Halaster's Heirs]] and took up residence in Undermountain, where she sold somewhat accurate maps of the dungeon levels.
