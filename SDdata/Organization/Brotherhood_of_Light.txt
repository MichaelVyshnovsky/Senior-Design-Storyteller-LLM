The '''Brotherhood of Light''' was a group of [[Lathander]]ite champions who operated in [[the North]] during the 11{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|14}}

==Possessions==
One of the order's [[paladin]]s, [[Dahaerlin|Dahaerlin of the Burning Brand]] commissioned the clergy at the [[Spires of the Morning]] to craft the mighty ''[[rod of Lathander]]''.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1024}}, the mountain village of [[Hespheira]] was magically transported away from the base of [[Mount Sar]] to the [[Plane of Shadow]]. The paladin Dahaerlin led the Brotherhood of Light to the the terrifying plane and traversed its shadowy terrain for four months, eventually reaching the [[Darklands (Shadowfell)|Darklands]].

Finally the Brotherhood came to battle the [[dracolich]] [[Umbralax]], achieving victory and freeing over half the missing village's residents. They suffered great loss however, losing their brave champion Dahaerlin. It was believed that he sacrificed his own life to ensure the escape of his allies and the people they saved.
