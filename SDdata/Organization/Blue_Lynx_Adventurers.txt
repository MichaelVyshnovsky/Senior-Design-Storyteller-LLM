The Blue Lynx Adventurers were an adventuring troupe for hire from the Sword Coast North in the late 15 century DR.
In the , the Blue Lynx Adventurers were hired by Lady Jannath to search for her missing consort, a painter of some renown, Oskar Fevras. The group was paid one thousand gold pieces for the service and one thousand more in incidentals. The band returned empty-handed, no trace of Oskar was found from Baldurs Gate to Waterdeep, which was not surprising as he was captured and enslaved by a gang of Zhentarim smugglers and kept in the Zhentarim hideout underneath Waukeens Rest inn in the Chionthar Valley.
