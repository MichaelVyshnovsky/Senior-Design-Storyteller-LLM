The Myir were a tribe of people living in the town of Nathoud between Rashemen and the Hordelands.
Famed for their prized Nathoudi stallions, the Myir were not known for anything other than horse-breeding.
Originally part of the Nar nation, the Myir adapted to the harsh life outside of Narfell. They abandoned their nomadic ways in favor of becoming sedentary farmers since they were not able to compete with the fierce Khassadi people of the region.
As of the midâ€“14th century DR, the Myir had been living a stationary existence for several centuries, but they were still poor in resources and technology compared to their neighbors.
