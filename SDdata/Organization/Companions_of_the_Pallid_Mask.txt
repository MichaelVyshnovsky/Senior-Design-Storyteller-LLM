The '''Companions of the Pallid Mask''' were a group of [[Jergal|Jergal's]] priests who specialized in combating and commanding the [[undead]]. They eliminated the undead creatures whose existence was not sanctioned by the church or who had proven to be troublesome. They also were the supervisors of the [[skeleton]] and [[zombie]] work crews that the church sometimes ran to profit itself.><ref name="PaP-p33" >
