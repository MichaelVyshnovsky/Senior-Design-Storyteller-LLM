'''The Burning Daggers''' were a fanatical [[Kossuth]]-worshiping group of [[orc]]s in [[Thar]].{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: The Tribes of Thar}}

==Description==
Each of them was branded in the center of the face with a dagger symbol as a sign of devotion.

==Base==
They inhabited deep caverns in Thar, around twenty miles from [[Glister]], where there was a rift to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]], into which they threw anyone they took captive. A black flaming [[dagger]] floated in the air inside this rift. It had been the focus of many searches by the [[Black Flame Zealots]] for a long time.

==Branding==
The branding of each orc took place once a year as a sign of devotion to Kossuth. The dagger brand covered the whole of the center of the face, with the point reaching towards the chin and the pommel on the forehead.
