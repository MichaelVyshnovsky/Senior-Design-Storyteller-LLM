The treasure hunters were to find hidden treasures, but instead, they came across Anaglathos and his ancient horde in the . The Company of the Sabred Tooth was one of the adventurers daring enough to venture into the mountains, guided by ranger Forier and his animal companion – wolf named Emerald. The band uncovered Anaglathoss lair and immediately went for the treasures. The blue dragon remained out of sight, and despite his first instinct to unleash his deadly lightning breath on the intruders, he decided to use trickery. The wyrm slew Emerald and took its shape, accompanying happy adventurers back to Alaghôn and magically charming the Company of the Sabred Tooth. As they passed through Turmishan settlements, the dragon used magic to enthrall leaders and his draconic might to scare folk into submission.\nThe Company of the Sabred Tooth was granted an audience with Lord Sendreth, hall with the immense wealth looted in the foray. Without wasting time, Anaglathos revealed his true form and swiftly disposed of the Lord of Turmish, claiming the title. The final fate of the Company of the Sabred Tooth was unknown however it was unlikely they made it out of the Lord of Tumishs throne room."
