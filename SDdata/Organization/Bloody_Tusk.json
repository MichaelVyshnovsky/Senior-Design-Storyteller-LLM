        "mainbody": "loody Tusk was an orcish tribe, led by a chieftain and active sometime before 1372 DR.\nBloody Tusk orcs were known to rival the barbarian Bear-Tooth tribe and its shaman leader Leustrarax. During one faithful attack, the Bloody Tusk and the Bear-Tooth tribe clashed in a long and fierce battle. After several waves of attacks, Bloody Tusks were pushed back into the cave system they called home. Armed with the Deep Dark Red set of enchanted armor that allowed its wearer to see in the dark, Leustrarax ventured into the void of the caverns, tracked the Bloody Tusk chieftain, and put an end to his raids with a single poisoned arrow."
