        "History": "Before House Belabranta became an official noble house of Waterdeep it could claim one of its members as a hero of the city. Ilithrew Belabranta was a famous griffon rider and hero of the second [[Trollwars|Trollwar]]. During that time he amassed a small fortune by plundering slain [[troll]] hoards. With some of those funds he was able to commission the construction of the ''[[Griffontack of Belabranta]]'', a set of magical items passed down to future generations.\n\nDuring an attack by an orc horde, known as the [[Black Claw]], upon Waterdeep in [[1026 DR]], now Lord Palinor Belabranta took to the skies on his griffon steed, only to be brought low by a volley of orc arrows. He and his mount crashed into the orc ranks and it was thought the Griffontack of Belabranta was lost forever.\n\nFor quite some time, Lord Huld had an affair with a courtesan at the [[House of Purple Silks]] within the city's [[Sea Ward of Waterdeep|Sea Ward]]. Unfortunately, he was unaware that his lover was actually a [[succubus]] named [[Elinaera]]. Some time before [[1372 DR]], the Lord and the fiend had a falling out and got into a fight. While the [[fiend]]ess was able to deal Lord Huld a mortal wound, the wizard of House Belabranta banished Elinaera from [[Toril]]. Just before he died, the lord's mind was consumed by a greater doppelganger of the [[Unseen]] who assumed his form and took over leadership of the noble house.{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|8}}\n\nAround 1372 DR, the ''Griffontack of Belabranta'' was recovered from the vault of [[House Ilvastarr]]. Lord Moedt Belabranta hired adventurers to break into the Ilvastarr Vault and prove the familyâ€™s age-long suspicion that a member of House Ilvastarr looted the artifacts from the fallen Lord Palinor.",
