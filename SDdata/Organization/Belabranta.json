        "mainbody": "Belabranta () was among the oldest noble houses of Waterdeep, being officially ennobled in 952 DR. They were famous griffon breeders, trainers and even hunters.\nthumb|right|270px|Map showing the location of the Belabranta Villa (labeled $52) circa 1372 DR.\nThe family owned a villa in the Sea Ward, on the northeast corner of Mendever Street and Rough Road.\nBefore House Belabranta became an official noble house of Waterdeep it could claim one of its members as a hero of the city. Ilithrew Belabranta was a famous griffon rider and hero of the second Trollwar. During that time he amassed a small fortune by plundering slain troll hoards. With some of those funds he was able to commission the construction of the Griffontack of Belabranta, a set of magical items passed down to future generations.\nDuring an attack by an orc horde, known as the Black Claw, upon Waterdeep in 1026 DR, now Lord Palinor Belabranta took to the skies on his griffon steed, only to be brought low by a volley of orc arrows. He and his mount crashed into the orc ranks and it was thought the Griffontack of Belabranta was lost forever.\nFor quite some time, Lord Huld had an affair with a courtesan at the House of Purple Silks within the citys Sea Ward. Unfortunately, he was unaware that his lover was actually a succubus named Elinaera. Some time before 1372 DR, the Lord and the fiend had a falling out and got into a fight. While the fiendess was able to deal Lord Huld a mortal wound, the wizard of House Belabranta banished Elinaera from Toril. Just before he died, the lords mind was consumed by a greater doppelganger of the Unseen who assumed his form and took over leadership of the noble house.\nAround 1372 DR, the Griffontack of Belabranta was recovered from the vault of House Ilvastarr. Lord Moedt Belabranta hired adventurers to break into the Ilvastarr Vault and prove the familyâ€™s age-long suspicion that a member of House Ilvastarr looted the artifacts from the fallen Lord Palinor.\n* Alith Belabranta Lady of House Belabranta circa 1372 DR.\n* Huld Belabranta The deceased patriarch of the family who was supplanted by a greater doppelganger called Rhelgen  sometime before 1372 DR.\n* Ilithrew Belabranta A hero of the Second Trollwar of 940 DR to 952 DR.\n* Kerryn Belabranta Second in line to Huld Belabranta, estranged from his father as of 1372 DR.\n* Moedt Belabranta Heir to Huld Belabranta as of 1372 DR, leader of the Griffon Cavalry.\n* Palinor Belabranta Died defending the city on griffonback from an orc horde in 1026 DR.\n* Savra Belabranta A young member of House Belabranta as of 1491 DR."
