        "Etymology": "Prior to the Spellplague, the word '''Gondar''' was used to refer to members of this Church.{{cite dragon/403/Gond's Way: Artificers of the Realms|2}}<ref> A third, less common term for members of the Church was '''Gondite'''. A fourth term, '''Gondian''', was used occasionally in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]<ref>{{Cite organized play/LC/Beautification Day|3,16-17}} and became popular in the [[Western Heartlands]] around the 15{{th}} century DR.\n\nGondian was a rather old term, normally applied to temples instead of priests. It was also occasionally used to refer to vestments and other items associated with the Church. By the 14{{th}} century DR it was still sometimes used for these purposes, though when it came to locations the term had been largely supplanted by '''Gondryr'''.<ref>{{Cite polyhedron/74/The Everwinking Eye: Words To The Wise|15}}",
        "Dogma": {
            "Attitudes": "The Church allowed membership to people of all [[alignment]]s, so long as they were interested in crafting and craftmanship.",
            "Beliefs": "Among a number of the faith's [[gnome]] members, who referred to Gond as either [[Nebelun]] or Gond Wonderbringer, it was believed that the god was gnomish in form rather than [[human]].\n\nViews on [[arcane magic]] were mixed within the Church.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2013)/Technology and the Arcane}} Generally, technology was not seen as being in opposition to arcane magic, with it being said Gond viewed magic as but another means of creating new devices.{{cite dragon/403/Gond's Way: Artificers of the Realms|2}} with priests on the island of [[Lantan]] even using arcane magic for propulsion and rust proofing.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-01-31 - Lantan Class System}} But there were some in the Church who did view it as the opposition, many of whom were members of a secret subsect.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"subsect\" /> Such Gondsmen believed that the greater the veneration of magic in a society, the less respect technology received.",
            "Secret Creed of the 15{{th}} century": "During the Spellplague Era, a subsect of the Church of Gond emerged that subscribed to a secret creed of secular aims. This secret creed urged Gondsmen to influence or control rulers so that the works of Gond would be embraced by the populace &mdash; or forced upon them, if necessary. Individuals and guilds who did not champion the works of Gond were to be smashed.The group described herein were not explicitly stated to be a subsect of the Church in ''[[Ed Greenwood Presents Elminster's Forgotten Realms]]''. However, this information is so egregiously incongruent with the lore of previous editions and future editions, as well as incompatible with the introduction of artificers, that the only rationale explanation is that this \"secret creed\" is not representative of the Church of Gond as a whole. \n\nThis creed also encouraged Gondsmen to avenge mechanical work and inventors who were destroyed by arcane magic users. It also called for spellcasters who openly derided, hated, or feared inventions and mechanics to be eliminated. This was preferred this be done covertly, if possible.\n\nAbove all, this secret subsect of the Church took the mercantile activities of the clergy a step further, becoming obsessed with amassing fortunes and power.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"subsect\" />"
        },
        "Organization": {
            "Titles": "The Church of Gond had a very ordered religious hierarchy, one where obedience to a superior was unquestioning.\n* '''High Artificer''', the highest position within the church hierarchy. In theory, their authority extended over all of Faerûn.\n* '''Artificer''', the title of a priest who has been personally rewarded and named by Gond for special service.\n* '''Master''', the title of a priest of tends a holy site or leads a religious community.\n* '''High Seeker''', the title held by all senior members of the clergy.\n* '''Seeker of the''', a title ranging from Twelfth to First Order.\n* '''Greater Seeker'''.\n* '''Seeker after Small Things''', the title of a confirmed priest.\n* '''Seeker Postulant''', the title for a priest in training.\n* '''Wonderer''', the title of a novice priest within the church.",
            "Classes": "Outside of Lantan, the Church was primarily made up of itinerant [[cleric]]s. This faith's clerics were called \"Krii\" in the [[Lantanese language]], a word that meant ''disadvantaged'', and were also formally styled as \"Wonderbringers.\" Clerics also referred to themselves as the \"Consecrated of Gond\", addressing their fellow priests as \"fellow Consecrates,\" \"Fellow Artificer,\" \"Brother Artificer,\" or \"Sister Artificer.\"\n\nThe [[specialty priest]]s of this faith included [[Gondsman (specialty priest)|Gondsmen]] and [[holy builder]]s. These presumably disappeared following the Spellplague,{{Speculation}} as all members of the faith began to be known as Gondsmen.\n\nThese specialty priests were succeeded in the latter half of the 14{{th}} century DR by [[techsmith]]s, men and women who were devoted to the development of new inventions to the point of extreme eccentricity. They were particularly skilled in the construction and destruction of constructs.\n\nThe [[artificer]]s of Gond,{{cite dragon/365/Playtest: Artificer}} gradually emerged during the Spellplague as priests of the Artificer rank sought to reinvent themselves and reclaim what the Church had lost during that catastrophe. They embraced arcane magic as means of improving their designs and often performed tasks that the average priest could not, utilizing their keen expertise in arcana and history.\n\nSome artificers were also clerics, acting as devout priests of Gond.{{cite dragon/403/Gond's Way: Artificers of the Realms|5}}",
            "Orders": "The Church of Gond had no affiliated [[knight]]ly orders, though it did have a great deal of honorary orders and societies. These groups were sponsored by the Church itself and most of the Gondar clergy were members of one or more. Such groups were usually founded to recognize the works of Gond within particular fields and ease the exchange of ideas among the members of said fields, whilst also preventing any church or trade secrets from becoming public knowledge. These groups included the following:\n* [[Armorers of the Wonderbringer]]\n* The [[Holy Order of the Most Skilled Architects and Bridgemakers]]\n* The [[Industrious Brothers and Sisters of Carpentry, Cabinetry, Puppetry, and Toymaking]]\n* [[Order of Puissant Stonemasons and Stonecarvers]]\n* The [[Most Arcane Order of Gearmakers, Clockmakers, and Automationists]]\n* The [[Society of Creative Castle Design and Construction]]"

        "Activities": {
            "Creation": "[[File:Techsmith.jpg|thumb|273px|''A techsmith works on their Gondsman construct.'']]\nWhen it came to the creations of its members, the Church was widely known for clockwork and [[golem]]work. small golems tasked with taking care of unsightly municipal duties, the mechanical bodyguard assistants known as [[gondsman|gondsmen]], and some [[warforged]].<ref>{{Cite dragon/371/Origin Stories: Incorporating Races|40}} Some Gondsmen had even sought to create [[helmed horror]]s with divine rituals and prayers, though they were unsuccessful.<ref>{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2008)/Aragus and Helmed Horrors}}\n\nGondar priests were also responsible for some major public works in the Realms. In the city of [[Baldur's Gate]], they were responsible for the city's refurbished [[Baldur's Gate/Sewers|sewers]],{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-07-25 - Sewers of Baldur's Gate}} as well as the design and construction of their dock's system of cargo railcarts, scoops, and massive cranes.<ref>",
            "Itinerant": "The clergy of Gond were itinerant, meanings clerics typically traveled all across Faerûn to spread their faith, share their creations, and discover new inventions. While traveling it was a Gondsmen's duty to observe, acquire (often by buying), and safely store samples of new inventions by others for later exhibition to other priests of the faith. Though in some cases they sought ancient relics and would hire [[adventurer|adventuring companies]] to retrieve them if they were in particularly dangerous places. If the item was magical in nature, then an artificer was often called upon.\n\nClergy also assisted inventors and innovators, including those who sell new mechanical creations or tools, regardless of whether or not they worshiped Gond. If others sought to capture or harm such inventors and selling for the purpose of seizing or destroying their work, then a Gondar was obligated to intervene. Either by defending them, freeing them, or liberating their work. And they were expected to regularly file reports with the nearest Master ranked priest by means of messengers of the faith.\n\nDue to the nomadic nature of Gondar clergy, it was frowned upon for clerics to settle in one place. Though superiors would allow this if a priest were to show that the locale was a place where innovation occured and therefore required the watchful eyes of the Church. Such areas in the past have included [[Athkatla]], [[Suzail]], [[Waterdeep]], and [[Zhentil Keep]].",
            "Knowledge": "Throughout their lives Gondsmen kept meticulous records of their ideas, their attempts at invention, and their progress towards creations. All this was to ensure that when the day came that they died, others could continue their work. They also kept journals of ideas, innovations, and inventions they discovered along their travels that they would turn over to the resident scribes of major temples, who in turn recorded their observations for posterity.\n\nGondsmen sought to spread to others outside the faith the knowledge and understanding of new tools, new ways doing things, and improved means of crafting or utilizing existing tools. They also discussed and spread their own ideas to others, in hopes that they may see the light of the Wonderbringer. And Gondsmen were encouraged to demonstrate to the public simple machines and tools like the cog, gear, lever, [[pulley]], and swivel joint in order to show that there were means of accomplishing great things without arcane and [[divine magic]].",
            "Mercantile": "Gondsmen were encouraged by their Church to make a living for themselves, Doing so not only demonstrated the rewards of following the Way of Gond. This included establishing alliances, caches of goods, and investments as they traveled. These investments they made were typically promising craftmen. Finding employment as builders, crafters, engineers, and smiths.\n\nMany Gondar supported themselves by selling various high-quality manufactured wares.{{cite dragon/403/Gond's Way: Artificers of the Realms|3}} wonderous inventions, and the substances that were closely guarded secrets of the Church.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century DR, the wares peddled by Gondsmen included [[bullet]]s and [[smokepowder]]. Non-adventuring techsmiths were also known to create and sell smokepowder weapons and bombs. The more unscrupulous of such techsmiths sought out conflicts where they could profit from supplying both sides.\n\nMembers of the Church's secret subsect took this mercantile aspect of their faith a step further,<ref group=\"note\" name=\"subsect\" /> using their money to buy up the buildings and land of those ruined by competition over their unique wares. Establishing hidden caches of weapons, transport vehicles, and their wealth and creating devices to entrap intruders.\n\nBeyond the activities of clerics, the Church of Gond notably had its own hard currency, known as [[gond bell]]s. Throughout most of Faerûn these were valued at 10 [[gold piece]]s, but within a temple of Gond they were worth 20 gp.<ref>",
            "Temple Secrets": "There were a number of inventions by the Church whose methods of creation were closely guarded secrets,{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-07-10 - Making Smokepowder}} or \"holy secrets of Gond.\" These included the methods for creating [[screw]]s and [[threaded bolt]]s,{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-05-30 - How Gunpowder Works in the Forgotten Realms}} Though Gondsmen had their own special tricks for making smokepowder, which they often expedited with [[spell]]s. One was a way of getting three dry ingredients to bond and another was a method of ensuring the final mixture stayed bonded.\n\nThe Church took whatever means were necessary to keep these \"temple secrets\" proprietary, eliminating rival makers by means of diplomacy, financial influence, or sabotage. This was done covertly, when possible. This was especially the case with smokepowder, as leaving that dangerous substance unchecked could endanger their faith's standing in many regions."

They were imposing, boxy structures of stone encircled by stout-pillared porticos. Inside they were scarce on decorations, aside from sprawling displays of the inventions of its clergy members that were either their latest or of historical importance. The central altar of temples was great machine, consisting of a massive [[anvil]] surrounded by cogs that spun endlessly.\n\nMost temples to Gond were not just ordinary places of worship, as their backrooms served as workshops{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-06-17 - Internal Combustion Engine}} Other temples sold things, such as expensive little [[clockwork toy]]s, [[firecracker]]s, [[fireworks]],<ref>{{Cite web/theedverse/2019-07-20 - Firecrackers & Fireworks in the Realms}} or the vehicles known as [[gondroller]]s.{{Cite web/theedverse/2020-05-20 - Gondroller}}\n\n[[Cathedral]]s, the most opulent of temples, were only ever seen on Lantan. Shrines on the other hand were common on the mainland and typically dominated by a single large, complex perpetual-motion machine. Any motion granted by someone pressing upon them would be magnified by a number of counterweights, gears, flywheels, and other such devices. They seldom ever had a utility, though sometimes served to drill or grind things.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2004)/Shrines of Gond, Temples of Lathander and Sune}}\n\nThe major defensible holy houses of the faith were linked by a network of ''[[portal]]s'' maintained by the priesthood.

            "Time of Troubles": "In the year [[1358 DR]], the mortal gnome [[avatar]] form of Gond washed up on the shores of Lantan. His nature was quickly discovered by the Lantanna, who sheltered and worshiped him until the Avatar Crisis had passed. Later that year, in gratitude for the sanctuary they provided him From that year onwards, the Lantanna priests of Gond (for a time, mainly the specialty priests) would work to spread the use of firearms, shipping them to Western ports.",
            "Post-Time of Troubles": "Interest in and worship of Gond was on the rise following the Time of Troubles, including among gnomes. As many young gnomes viewed the fact that Gond's avatar took the form of a gnome as a sign that it was time for their race to invent a new way of life.<ref> In this early period many gnomish communities frowned upon becoming a priest of Gond, but over time it gained greater acceptance.\n\nBut alongside this rise in interest was a rise in attacks upon the clergy by rival faiths and those who feared their inventions. Rival makers of Lantan's special glass jars slowly emerged in the nations of [[Calimshan]] and [[Tashalar]], while elsewhere there emerged rival makers of firearms, though they were inferior to that of the Gondar.\n\nBy [[1367 DR]], priests of Gond could be found throughout [[the North]].<ref>\n\nBy {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Church had made firearms available all throughout [[Faerûn]]. But in turn they had earned the ire of many rulers, who saw the weapons as a threat to their authority. Around that same time, Gondsmen in Mulhorand aided that land in reviving their degradading system of irrigation pumps.\n\nIn [[1373 DR]], missionaries traveled from Lantan to the continent of [[Maztica]]. On [[Tarsakh 18]] they established a temple on the largest island of the [[Green Sisters]] archipelago, which they proceeded to name [[St. Ippen]].<ref>",
            "Spellplague Era": "In the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the [[Spellplague]] erupted, causing a sudden shifting of continental bodies that sent tsunamis all along Lantan and the coastal regions of Faerûn, devastating them all. Before the waves reached the island, all the smokepowder and magical reagents on Lantan exploded simultaneously, causing great chaos. When the waves reached the coastline, most of Lantan was engulfed by the Spellplague and sent to the world of [[Abeir]]. What remained of Lantan on [[Toril]] was entirely flooded, killing the remaining inhabitants and washing away their advanced technology.\n\nWith the loss of Lantan and the faith's central temple left crumbled beneath the sea, the Church of Gond was severely crippled. And it wasn't long before the Church became split into two ideological camps. Those seeking to push ever onwards with new inventions and those who sought to reclaim and duplicate the lost marvels of Lantan. Though a third, lesser known ideological camp also developed, one that was obsessed with amassing fortune and power.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"subsect\" />\n\nMany worshipers embraced the itinerant lifestyle, seeking to design and rebuild temples in major cities, such as Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep. Others combed Toril in search of designs and inventions that were believed to be lost. The greatest concentration of Gondar occurred in the East Rift, where High Artificer [[Cavandro]] was permitted by the Deep Lords of Eartheart to build a new central temple for their faith, the Crafthouse of Inspiration. This building began construction in [[1469 DR]] and finished in [[1470 DR]].\n\nThe remaining artificers of the faith would gradually reinvent themselves as arcane spellcasters and took on many roles. Some became archaeologists, devoted to recovering the remnants of Lantan. Some became teachers, recruiting and teaching others of their ways. But most devoted their time to relearning some facet of Lantan crafting, with only legends and stories to guide them,{{cite dragon/403/Gond's Way: Artificers of the Realms|4}}\n\nEventually, the artificers of Gond did reclaim much of what had been lost, even creating new wonders that rivalled those of Lantan. With the work done by the artificers, the Church of Gond's future became much brighter.",
            "Post-Spellplague Era": "In [[1487 DR]], the parts of Lantan that had gone to Abeir were returned to Toril as part of the [[Second Sundering]]. Lantanna ships began to travel once more to the Sword Coast, but their merchants would say little about the state of their homeland."
