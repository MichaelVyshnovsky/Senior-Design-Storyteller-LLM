'''The Chuen''' were a small, traditionalist [[Shou]] society based in the [[Xiousing]] district of [[Marsember]].  Their name literally meant "The Pure".[[Dan Anderson]]. "Backdrop: Xiousing." ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #195. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, October 2011.  

==Beliefs==
The Chuen's beliefs bordered on xenophobia and members had a strong dislike of non-Shou.  Members ran Shou-only businesses and harassed native Marsembans who visited Xiousing.  The Chuen wrongly believed [[Duc-Sum Li]] established Xiousing to bring about Shou dominance of [[Cormyr]].
