The Gatherer Creed was one of the major illithid Creeds in the Realms. This Creed was different from the other Creeds as it dealt with immigration. They believed that the best way to gather knowledge was to reunite the widely scattered illithid hives.
The Gatherers had a base called the Hall of Melding in Oryndoll. This Creed succeeded in concentrating illithid activity in southwestern Faer√ªn in Oryndoll.
