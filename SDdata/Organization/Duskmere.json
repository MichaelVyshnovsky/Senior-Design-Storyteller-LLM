Claiming they needed aid to repel [[troll]] attacks, they drew a force led by one of the King's deputies, the [[elven]] [[wizard]] [[Rhespen Ash]]. Rhespen's forces were nearly routed, but they, and he personally, were saved by the arrival of Prince [[Bexendral]], who teleported in and broke the rebel forces. In response to this treachery, King Orchtrien had the heirs of the three houses involved in the plot, the Starfall, Vilirith, and Duskmere, seized and brought to his home in Dawnfire for education and to serve as his hostages. House Duskmere sent as their hostage [[Winterflower Duskmere]], the Count's daughter.\n\nBy {{yearlink|-25089}}, Winterflower Duskmere returned to them with a trove of copied [[spellbook]]s pilfered from Orchtrien. In response, the Count and his court took the house into hiding at a secret stronghold.{{cite book/Realms of the Elves/Traitors|55}} This stronghold was eventually found and destroyed by King Orchtrien and his forces, leaving Winterflower Duskmere as the only survivor."
