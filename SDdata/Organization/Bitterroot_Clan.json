        "mainbody": "'''Bitterroot Clan''' was a [[duergar]] clan of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "According to the report of [[Z'rell|Disciple Z'rell]] called ''[[Beheading the Bitterroots]]'', in the early 1490s DR, the Bitterroot Clan held [[Grymforge]] and were ruled by [[King Guerdon]]. The members of the clan were few in number but regarded as fierce opponents in combat.\n\nDuring the [[Absolute crisis]], the clan was a threat to the plans of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], making it difficult to use the [[Underdark]] routes connecting the [[Moonrise Towers]] and the [[Shattered Sanctum]]. It was decided to use a squad of [[Orin]]'s [[doppelganger]]s to get rid of the clan's king. Additionally, the squad should have been tasked with throwing King Guerdon's crown into the [[Fathomless Depths]], thus preventing the clan from crowning a new king. The \"beheaded\" clan would fall apart, letting the cultists bring the duergar under their control.\n\nAlthough the details of the actual downfall of Clan Bitterroot remain unknown, by the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Grymforge was under control of the Cult of the Absolute and [[Clan Flameshade]] was hired to help excavate the ruins.It is possible that Clan Flameshade members were once members of the Bitterroot Clan."
