        "Description": "The Alhoon were illithids of [[Ellyn'taal]] and embraced [[lichdom]] under the guidance of their teacher.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|-339}}, Ioulaum permanently left his enclave in [[Netheril]] and from then on lived in his [[Underdark]] base, which was near the city of Ellyn'taal. Ioulaum, who was a lich, took apprentices from this city of mind flayers. This group of students went on become the first [[illithilich]]es, and named themselves the Alhoon.\n\nThe Alhoon studied under the Netherese lich until the {{YearlinkName|329}}. At this time, Ioulaum used the minds of the Alhoon to create an [[undead]] [[elder brain]]. After this, Ioulaum merged his sentience with it, becoming the Oracle of Ellyn'taal. Though most members of the Alhoon were destroyed in the creation of the elder brain, some of them escaped to other parts of the Underdark. Some believed that these illithiliches actually killed Ioulaum, though this was not true."
