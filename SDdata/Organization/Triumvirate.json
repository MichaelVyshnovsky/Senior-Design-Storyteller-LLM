They conquered the beholder city of Ooltul in the Northdark.\nIn their continuing war against the beholders, the Triumvirate learned from the still-trapped phaerimm their ancient methods for creating a beholderkin known as a gouger. They also created miniature, mutated beholderkin known as eyeballs. However, the Triumvirate allowed their mutant creatures to stray out and across the Underdark.\nBy 1372 DR, they plotted to release the other phaerimm still trapped in Anauroch.\nCategoryPolitical organizations\nCategorySpellcasting organizations\nCategoryOrganizations in the Northdark\nCategoryOrganizations in the Middledark\nCategoryOrganizations in the Underdark\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\n1z5hjsoxsoe4ii8oneuw73g6e33xqcf"
