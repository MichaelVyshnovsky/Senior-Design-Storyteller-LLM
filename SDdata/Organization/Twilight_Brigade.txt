The Twilight Brigade were a unit of soldiers that fought for Gondegal during his war in 1352 DR, and Lord Vorik Aris in 1369 DR.
The Twilight Brigade consisted of 32 veteran mercenaries equipped with chain mail, longswords, daggers, shortbows and flight arrows.
During Gondegals war in 1352 DR, the Twilight Brigade operated in the Stonelands, attacking targets of opportunity. They went uncontested by the Starburst Swords Purple Dragons unit and attacked the undefended village of Darkenshield, razing it and slaughtering the entire population without mercy.
By 1369 DR, they had found employment with Lord Aris, who wished to achieve the conquest of Cormyr. Along with other mercenaries such as the Eye Killers, the 32 members of the unit gathered in Wyvernwatch Castle, with one of them, Tobias Querl, becoming Captain of the guard.
When they marched on the ruins of Darkenshield in preparation for a greater campaign, they were instead met by the furious spirits of the village, returned for vengeance, and the spirits of the Starburst Swords, performing a final duty. The Twilight Brigade was torn apart by their own dead victims, with none surviving the battle.
