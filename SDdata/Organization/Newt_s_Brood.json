        "mainbody": "The Newts Brood was a witch coven responsible for creation of the set of enchanted chainmail called the Zeals Walk.\nSometime before 1372 DR, the ladies of the Newts Brood found them selves a lover in an especially good-looking ranger, Tholan the Beautiful. The witches paramour often traveled to far away lands and was gone for long periods of time, so the Newts Brood created the Zeals Walk to keep track of their wayward consort. Eventually, Tholan married another, an elven woman. To avoid the witches scorn, the ranger disposed of the magic chainmail, leaving the Newts Brood unaware of the betrayal."
