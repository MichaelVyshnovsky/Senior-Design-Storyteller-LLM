        "mainbody": "The '''Senate of Innarlith''' was the ruling body of the city-state of [[Innarlith]] and headed by a leader that had the title of Ransar. Entrance to the senate was open to the wealthy who purchased their seats on the senate.",
        "Organization": "The senate was composed of a large number of men and women that came from the aristocracy of Innarlith. Some of them were born into wealthy senatorial families, while others purchased their seats after acquiring enough wealth. The senate itself was further divided into smaller committees that had responsibility for different functions in the city-state. Once a person had purchased their seat, they usually remained on the senate for life.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Senate convened its meetings in the [[Chamber of Law and Civility]], the main legislative house of Innarlith. The Ransar's palace was called the [[Palace of Many Spires]] and it was located nearby in the second quarter of Innarlith.<ref>",
        "Relationships": "The members of the senate were composed of the city's wealthy elite and generally they controlled most of the commercial activity in the city-state. Class conflicts between them and the poor working masses of Innarlith occurred.<ref>",
        "History": "In the mid-1360s [[DR]], the [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]] secretly developed great influence over the body of the senate. This became especially true on [[Highharvestide]] in the {{yearlinkName|1365}}, when Senator [[Salatis]] used an army of [[black firedrake]]s supplied by the clandestine Red Wizard [[Marek Rym√ºt]] to assassinate and overthrow Ransar [[Osorkon]]. This after the latter began a project to construct a canal that would link the [[Lake of Steam]] to the [[Vilhon Reach]], which threatened the Thayan trade in magical ''[[portal]]s'' for ships. Marek then attempted to control Ransar Salatis as his puppet to rule the city, who agreed to the establishment of a [[Thayan enclave]] in Innarlith.<ref>\n\nSenator [[Pristoleph]] later in [[1371 DR]] raised an army and laid siege to Innarlith in order to overthrow Salatis and make himself ransar. Pristoleph succeeded and became the new ransar of Innarlith. However, Marek and his Red Wizards could not control Pristoleph, who violated their wishes. Marek then fostered a faction of senators and their supporters to start a civil war to overthrow Pristoleph in [[1374 DR]], but the attempt failed and Pristoleph held onto power. Pristoleph then executed and exiled the senators who had fought against him, as well as the Thayans who had been behind their attempt. <ref>",
