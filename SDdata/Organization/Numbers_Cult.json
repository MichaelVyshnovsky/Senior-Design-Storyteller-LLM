        "mainbody": "The '''Numbers Cult''' was a secret society of mages and mathematicians in [[Chessenta]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They worked to define [[magic]] in terms of [[mathematics]]. They believed the resulting equations would conquer the world! However, their basic premise was apparently based on a fallacy.\n\nThe philosopher of [[Cimbar]], [[Heptios|Heptios the Archmage]], had been rumored to be involved in the Numbers Cult, but he disavowed any connection with them by [[1357 DR]]."
