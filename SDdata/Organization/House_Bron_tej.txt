'''House Bron'tej''' was a deceased [[drow]] house of [[Menzoberranzan]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1227}}, House Bron'tej was the 27{{th}} house of Menzoberranzan. Later that year, [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]]  gathered their mages and took down House Bron'tej. All that remained of the house was a pool of sludge, that was suspiciously similar to the house insignia of House Barrison Del'Armgo.
