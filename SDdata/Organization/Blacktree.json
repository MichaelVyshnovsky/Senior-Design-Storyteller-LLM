They were highly respected among the city's [[Nobility of Ravens Bluff|nobility]] and commoners alike, and remained quite wealthy, despite some previous poorly chosen and somewhat shady investments.\n\nTheir family motto was: \"outroar the lion\".",
        "History": "During [[War of Ravens Bluff|the war]], Lord Blacktree contributed his complement of 250 \"gardeners\" and his 20-strong cadre of personal guards, known as the [[Black Knights]], to the raising of the Ravenian army.\n\nFollowing the conflict, Lord Blacktree brought a great deal of acclaim and renown to the noble house. He was praised by his fellow nobility and granted knighthood in the [[Knights of the Lady|Order of the Lady]]. In the mayoral election that followed the war, Lord Blacktree campaigned for the post, with full support of the Ravenian army. Despite this, he couldn't quite raise enough [[gold]] as [[Amber Lynn Thoden|Lady Amber Lynn Thoden]], and she won the post.\n\nThe Blacktree family further solidified their power base in Ravens Bluff, as well as their ties with [[Moorland|House Moorland]], one of the founding families of the city, following the marriage of Lord Charles Blacktree IV to [[Katherine Marie Moorland|Lady Katherine Moorland]],",
