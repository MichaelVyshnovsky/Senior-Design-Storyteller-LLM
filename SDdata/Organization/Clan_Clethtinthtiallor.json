They also were known for breeding warhorses. Their lands were located to the northeast of Tymanther, near the Riders to the Sky.\nDuring the Second Sundering, Clan Clethtinthtiallor lost a third of their number when Abeir and Toril exchanged lands, and most of their members were captured by the returned Untherans to be their slaves. Thanks to the efforts of Dahl Peredur, Mira Zawad and Namshita, most members of Clan Clethtinthtiallor were rescued, and returned to Tymanther.\n* Clethtinthtiallor Zarjhan, the clan elder in 1487 DR."
