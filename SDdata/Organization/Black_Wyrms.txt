The '''Black Wyrms''' were a group of powerful [[dragon aging|elder]] [[black dragon]]s who ruled over a kingdom of [[dwarves]] and [[human]]s on another world.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, this world was visited by a band of adventurers from [[Toril]]—Prince Royal [[Shaliim Wyrmslayer|Shaliim]] of [[Lapaliiya]] and some "wildblades" hailing from [[Waterdeep]]—who had discovered a network of ''[[portal]]s''. They were quickly captured, but battled to escape. In the end, Shaliim even jumped inside the mouth of one of the black wyrms and killed it from the inside. On the way, they even robbed from the dragons' hoard.

However, the Black Wyrms sought revenge. Following ten years of effort, they tracked the wildblades back to Toril, located the adventurers themselves, and discreetly killed them, one by one. News of the disappearances eventually reached Shaliim, now Overking of Lapaliiya. When in the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, a [[black dragon]] was sighted swimming in [[Talar Bay]], Shaliim stayed sheltered within the Domed Palace as he worked desperately on a plan to respond to the Black Wyrm's threat.
