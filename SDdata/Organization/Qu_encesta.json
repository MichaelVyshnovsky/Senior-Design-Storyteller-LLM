        "mainbody": "The Quencesta were a far-ranging tribe of Nars found in  Narfell known for their savage nature. There were 2,700 Quencesta in 1357 DR.\nThough they often treated foreigners with hostility, the Quencesta were on decent terms with the other tribes of Nar found in Narfell. There was always a chance that any defeated outsider would be allowed to flee the boundaries of Narfell if the Quencesta believed they fought bravely.\nThe Quencesta dominated most of central Narfell between Icelace Lake and the Rawlinswood."
