The '''Far Quey''' were a martial tribe of [[Nar (ethnicity)|Nars]] found in  [[Narfell]] who were renowned for their toughness. There were 2,300 Far Quey in [[1357 DR]].

==Activities==
Given their rugged lifestyle and fierce attitude toward outsiders, the Far Quey were one of the more dangerous tribes to encounter in Narfell. However, their habitat was not an area that received many travelers.

==Base of Operations==
The warriors of the Far Quey inhabited the frigid lands between the northern shores of [[Icelace Lake]] and the [[Great Glacier]].
