        "mainbody": "The Doomed Legion, sometimes incorrectly referred to as the Legion of the Damned was a fighting force that served Price Ketheryll of the Moonshae Isles in the late 3 century DR.\nThe Doomed Legion was a highly successful military force that enabled Prince Ketheryll to go to war with his neighbors and conquer them. Notably, they expelled all of his human rivals from the Isle of Gwynneth. Not as widely known was their role in capturing King Durnhal and Queen Morgan of Corwell in the , whose downfall many attributed to betrayal rather than conquest. \nOn the night of the Summer Solstice in the , the inhabitants of the Castle of Skulls, including the Legion, wiped each other out in a gibbering, suicidal orgy of combat. Some suspected that the wizard Flamsterd may have actually contributed to this, causing them to disappear with the aid of the Earthmother  Some members of the Legion attempted to escape the Castle, but Ketheryll did not allow it and declared them to be deceivers and traitors.\nEven over a millennium later, tales of the Legions successes in their masters campaigns of conquests were widely known and accepted as true on Gwynneth.\nThe Legion comprised Ketherylls soldiers, lieutenants, and retainers. They all swore their lives to his service, but in truth were branded with his symbol (a skull) which magically bound them to his service. They were housed within the Castle of Skulls where they lived in cramped, low alcoves that dotted the perimeter of a large, arched room made entirely of bones.\nIt was said that a pastime enjoyed by the Legion was executing captives in the Circus Bizarre for the amusement of their master.\nNotable members included Garius, a rogue who attempted to flee from the Castle of Skulls on the Legions fateful last night and about whom there were tales suggesting that he had succeeded."
