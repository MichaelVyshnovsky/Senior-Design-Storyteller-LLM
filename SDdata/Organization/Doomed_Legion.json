        "mainbody": "The '''Doomed Legion''', sometimes incorrectly referred to as the '''Legion of the Damned''' was a fighting force that served Price [[Ketheryll]] of the [[Moonshae Isles]] in the late 3{{rd}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|26}}\n{{Quote|I'd heard that each of the prince's men had sworn to give his life to protect him, but never anything about them being branded. It's not surprising, though, since the prince was always so interested in magic.|[[Stefanik]], [[1356 DR]].}}",
        "History": "The Doomed Legion was a highly successful military force that enabled Prince Ketheryll to go to war with his neighbors and conquer them. Notably, they expelled all of his [[human]] rivals from the Isle of [[Gwynneth]]. Not as widely known was their role in capturing King [[Durnhal]] and Queen [[Morgan]] of [[Corwell]] in the {{YearlinkName|295}}, whose downfall many attributed to betrayal rather than conquest. \n\nOn the night of the [[Summer Solstice]] in the {{YearlinkName|299}}, the inhabitants of the Castle of Skulls, including the Legion, wiped each other out in a gibbering, suicidal orgy of combat. Some suspected that the [[wizard]] [[Flamsterd (person)|Flamsterd]] may have actually contributed to this, causing them to disappear with the aid of the [[Earthmother]]  Some members of the Legion attempted to escape the Castle, but Ketheryll did not allow it and declared them to be deceivers and traitors.\n\nEven over a millennium later, tales of the Legion's successes in their master's campaigns of conquests were widely known and accepted as true on Gwynneth.",
        "Members": "The Legion comprised Ketheryll's soldiers, lieutenants, and retainers. They all swore their lives to his service, but in truth were branded with his symbol (a skull) which [[magic]]ally bound them to his service. They were housed within the Castle of Skulls where they lived in cramped, low alcoves that dotted the perimeter of a large, arched room made entirely of bones.\n\nIt was said that a pastime enjoyed by the Legion was executing captives in the [[Circus Bizarre]] for the amusement of their master.\n\nNotable members included [[Garius]], a [[rogue]] who attempted to flee from the Castle of Skulls on the Legion's fateful last night and about whom there were tales suggesting that he had succeeded."
