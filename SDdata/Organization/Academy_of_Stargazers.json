        "mainbody": "The '''Stargazer Academy''' was an all-female school for [[astrology]] and [[magic]] in the mid&ndash;14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dungeon/72/Mistress on the Mere}}",
        "Base of Operations": "The Stargazer Academy was formerly based in [[Waterdeep]]. The organization later moved to [[Castle Naerytar]] in the [[Mere of Dead Men]].",
        "History": "After leaving [[Zazesspur]], [[Adele Astrolara]] formed a small academy in Waterdeep to share her knowledge of magic and astrology. She maintained the school there for several years until the mysterious disappearance of one of her students, who was also the daughter of a powerful noble family.\n\nSeeking a new place where she could conduct her business in more privacy, Adele heard of the work of Sir [[Justin Melenikus]] in the Mere of Dead Men and of the abandoned Castle Naerytar in the swamps. Adele and her group of [[wizard]]-students cleared the castle of a tribe of [[bullywug]]s and moved in. Soon after, she hired a group of workers from Waterdeep to clean and repair parts of the castle and to build a road from the [[High Road]] to the academy.\n\nStarmistress Adele brought with her materials she acquired in [[Skullport]] to transform a dome in the castle into a magical viewing hemisphere to study the stars and secretly spy on the surrounding area. She also had a magical telescope, the [[Farseer of Illusk]], brought to the academy and set it up in the domed room turned observatory.\n\nOf particular note was the discovery by some her students of the celestial event known as the [[Eye of Myrkul]], which would trigger other events in the Mere.\n\nThe Academy of Stargazers remained in the Mere of Dead Men for several years until it mysteriously disappeared and left Castle Naerytar abandoned once again, as it was by the 1480s [[DR]].",
        "Rules of the Academy": "There were several rules established by Adele and posted in every room of the Academy. Foremost amongst these rules was that every member of the academy had to be female. Adele had her own reasons for this that only she knew. Other rules involved the order and discipline required of all students and visitors alike. Some of these rules included that no student could leave the Academy unless dismissed by the Starmistress and all members must remain chaste. The rules also outlined dress codes, promotions, and disciplinary actions.\n\nEach student was required to swear an oath to adhere to all of the rules or face expulsion. Their families were also required to sign an agreement that waived their rights to remove their family member from the Academy. Upon reaching a high enough level of mastery, members were also required to swear an oath of allegiance to the Mistress and a vow of chastity.",
