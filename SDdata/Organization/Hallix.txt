The Hallixes were a family based in Neverwinter.
Like other wealthy Neverwintan families, the Hallixes maintained a family mausoleum in the Neverdeath Main Graveyard. This mausoleum contained a secret connection to the crypts of the Waterclock Guild.
The family had been living and burying its dead in Neverwinter for a long time prior to the eruption of Mount Hotenow in the mid&ndash15 century DR. Six members of the family died following that eruption.
Within forty years, the family mausoleum would become home to a cult dedicated to Vecna, and the remains of the Hallix family interred there were consumed by the cults ghouls.
