The Yaerthal Dynasty was the first ruling dynasty of Dambrath.
The dynasty began in 545 DR when the Arkaiun warchief Reinhar Yaerthal united the Arkainun tribes of Dambrath under his leadership and led them to war against Luiren and Halruaa. After his death at war, his son, Reinhar II, took command of his fathers army however, he was defeated by Halruaa. Reinhar II retreated back to Dambrath and consolidated his new kingdom there.
In 600 DR, Reinhar III and his sons were killed by giants while on a hunting trip, and this triggered a brief war of succession. At the end of it, Reinhar IIIs nephew succeeded him and took the name Reinhar IV.
The entire dynasty contained nine kings of the same name. By the time of Reinhar IX in 802 DR, the Arkaiun of Dambrath were a lazy people, yet Reinhar the Foolish, as he was known to history, insisted on leading his people to expand their territory as Reinhar I had attempted. His plans were stopped, however, when his people encountered the drow of Tlindhet, leading to a 30-year war. The war ended with betrayal in 831 DR when a half-elven priestess of Loviatar named Cathtyr Shintar offered her assistance and that of her fellow half-elven pilgrims to the humans to defend against the drow. Instead, Cathtyr murdered Reinhar within a week and offered a truce to the drow armies, thus setting herself up as the new queen of Dambrath and founder of the Crinti Hazmcri Dynasty.
