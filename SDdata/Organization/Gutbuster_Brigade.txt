The '''Gutbuster Brigade''' was a famous [[battlerager]] squad founded by [[Thibbledorf Pwent]] in [[Mithral Hall]]. They had their own brand of gung-ho tactics and often disregarded the typical order and discipline in favor of a more direct approach.

==History==
The Gutbuster Brigade was formed in [[1357 DR]], when an army of [[drow]] attacked Mithral Hall. Thibbledorf Pwent hand-selected a score of dwarves to train as battleragers - a chaotic form of fighting, with various battlerager guilds having varying styles - Thibbledorf's personal 'art' consisted of putting on a full suit armor full covered in  spikes, and throwing himself at the enemy, convulsing violently and shredding them. This turned out to be a highly efficient way of fighting in the narrow underground corridors and the Gutbusters took the drow completely by surprise.

After Pwent's apparent death, the Gutbusters continued on. In [[1484 DR]], the leader of the Gutbusters was [[Bungalow Thump]], who, following Pwent's service to [[Bruenor Battlehammer]], was the personal bodyguard to [[Connerad Brawnanvil|King Connerad Brawnanvil]].
