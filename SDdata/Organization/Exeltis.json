        "mainbody": "The '''Exeltis''' family was a noble family from the [[Sword Coast North]] who built their status and sizable fortune by cultivating special small grey [[grape]]s that grew around [[Castle Exeltis]], turning it into fine [[Exeltis Ice Wine]].",
        "History": "The first person to create the recipe for Exeltis Ice Wine was [[Cedric Exeltis]]. After that the Exeltis family patiently cared for the sprawling vineyards, which were the main source of income for the clan for many generations. A couple of decades before [[1372 DR]], the Lord of the castle, a kind and just man by all accounts, died from an infected wound when his son, [[Feldran Exeltis]], was only a child. The mistress of the castle, Lady Exeltis, died under mysterious circumstances many years later, leaving the family business and Castle Exeltis to her only heirâ€”the ambitious young lord Feldran.\n\nIn reality, Feldran Exeltis was the reason for the castle's decline, and the death of his mother. Some of the hushed [[bard]] songs along the Sword Coast told the tale of the young lord accompanying his old mother on her late night walks along the cliffs and plunging the ''[[Exeltis Blade]]'' in her back, later claiming the Lady fell to her death. Her gravestone was erected at the bottom of the cliffs where she allegedly met her doom.\n\nBy 1372 DR, Castle Exeltis was in disrepair and the family fortune was squandered away on lavish purchases and senseless gambling by Feldran Exeltis. His managing of the family resources led to an almost complete halt of Exeltis Ice Wine production, making the bottles that were still out there a precious rarity. The financial situation became so dreary that Feldran took several sizable loans from dubious moneylenders from [[Waterdeep]]."
