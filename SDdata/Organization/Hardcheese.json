        "mainbody": "'''Hardcheese''' was a prosperous [[halfling]] family from the city of [[Daggerford]] that operated the [[Happy Cow]] tavern",
        "Relationships": "In the 14{{th}} century DR, [[Fulbar Hardcheese]] was being paid close attention to by the [[Lords' Alliance]], the [[Harpers]], and the [[Zhentarim]], despite him actively trying to keep a low profile and being a \"quiet power\" in [[northwest Faerûn]].\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century DR, a shape-changed [[bronze dragon]] named [[Zirazylym]], or \"Zira,\" became the tavern's patron. She grew quite fond of the Hardcheese clan but chose not to meddle in their affairs. However, she would protect the hin if they were to come to a direct conflict with the Zhentarim, the clan's main competitor in the moneylending business.",
        "Possessions": "Apart from the land, farm, and the Happy Cow tavern, the Hardcheeses also owed a home in Daggerford. [[Fulbar Hardcheese's Residence]] A little known fact was that Fulbar and the Hardcheeses owned a large number of properties in [[Neverwinter]] as well as [[Baldur's Gate]].",
        "History": "Fulbar Hardcheese was an [[adventuring]] hin [[thief]], who retired to run the Happy Cow in Daggerford some years before the {{YearlinkName|1357}} and was ashamed of his past. Another property owned by the family was a dairy farm just outside of the city, managed by Fulbar's son, [[Dickon Hardcheese]]. It was also rumored that Fulbar Hardcheese tutored halflings in the [[rogue]] and thieving skills, however, that was never confirmed.\n\nThe halfling family still ran the Happy Cow and was known as kind and generous folk in the late 15{{th}} century DR. They also retained the dairy farm and expanded their farming lands to a number of fields outside of town, some of which were rented out. Those friendly with the clan were also allowed to borrow [[coin]] from the Hardcheeses, which included many of the local farmers. In the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, [[Curran Corvalin]], a hin devote of [[Tymora]], convinced the halfling family to provide food to the refugees that were granted accommodations at [[Lizard's Gizzard]]. Curran partially financed the meals alongside the Hardcheeses.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1488}}, moneylending had become the main business for the Hardcheese family, with the Zhentarim being their main competitor.",
        "Members": "* [[Fulbar Hardcheese]], the halfling who started the tavern-keeping and farming family.\n* [[Dickon Hardcheese]], Fulbar's son in the late 14{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Koggin Hardcheese]], one of the halflings who ran the tavern in the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Lily Hardcheese]], a halfling woman who married into the Hardcheese family in the 15{{th}} century DR."
