Another property owned by the family was a dairy farm just outside of the city, managed by Fulbars son, Dickon Hardcheese. It was also rumored that Fulbar Hardcheese tutored halflings in the rogue and thieving skills, however, that was never confirmed.\nThe halfling family still ran the Happy Cow and was known as kind and generous folk in the late 15 century DR. They also retained the dairy farm and expanded their farming lands to a number of fields outside of town, some of which were rented out. Those friendly with the clan were also allowed to borrow coin from the Hardcheeses, which included many of the local farmers. In the , Curran Corvalin, a hin devote of Tymora, convinced the halfling family to provide food to the refugees that were granted accommodations at Lizards Gizzard. Curran partially financed the meals alongside the Hardcheeses.\nBy the , moneylending had become the main business for the Hardcheese family, with the Zhentarim being their main competitor.\n* Fulbar Hardcheese, the halfling who started the tavern-keeping and farming family.\n* Dickon Hardcheese, Fulbars son in the late 14 century DR.\n* Koggin Hardcheese, one of the halflings who ran the tavern in the late 15 century DR.\n* Lily Hardcheese, a halfling woman who married into the Hardcheese family in the 15 century DR."
