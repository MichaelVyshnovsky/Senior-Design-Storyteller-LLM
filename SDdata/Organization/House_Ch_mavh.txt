Castle Maerimydra, Maerimydra (until 1372 DR)
House Chûmavh was the ruling drow house of the city of Maerimydra in the Deep Wastes in the 14 century DR. 
Until 1372 DR, House Chûmavh resided within the impressive Castle Maerimydra, which overlooked the city of the same name. After the citys destruction, however, Tower Chûmavhraele became the new base for the House under the city of Ravens Bluff.
In the , the Silence of Lolth rendered all the Lolth-worshipers in Maerimydra without their ability to cast divine spells. In the wake of this, many sought to overthrow the city, including the citys archmage. Although Archmage Duneth Wharreil and his demonic allies did not topple the defensive structure of Castle Maerimydra, another enemy did manage to defeat them. The aspiring cult of Kiaransalee, led by Irae Tsarran, sneaked into the Castle and slew all House Chûmavhs Lolth-worshipers. There ended the reign of House Chûmavh in Maerimydra.
After the fall of Maermydra, the survivors relocated to Tower Chûmavhraele under the leadership of Marquise Dresimil Chûmavh. In the , House Chûmavh attempted to activate an ancient drow mythal, inadvertently releasing Jack Ravenwild in the process.
