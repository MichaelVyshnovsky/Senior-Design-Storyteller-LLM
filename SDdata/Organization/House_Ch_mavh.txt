'''House Chûmavh''' was the ruling [[drow]] house of the city of [[Maerimydra]] in the [[Deep Wastes]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. 

==Base of Operations==
Until 1372 DR, House Chûmavh resided within the impressive [[Castle Maerimydra]], which overlooked the city of the same name. After the city's destruction, however, [[Tower Chûmavhraele]] became the new base for the House under the city of [[Ravens Bluff]].{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|1595}}

==History==
===Rulers of Maerimydra===
In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the [[Silence of Lolth]] rendered all the [[Lolth]]-worshipers in Maerimydra without their ability to cast [[Divine magic|divine]] spells. In the wake of this, many sought to overthrow the city, including the city's [[archmage]]. Although Archmage [[Duneth Wharreil]] and his [[demon]]ic allies did not topple the defensive structure of Castle Maerimydra, another enemy did manage to defeat them. The aspiring cult of [[Kiaransalee]], led by [[Irae T'sarran]], sneaked into the Castle and slew all House Chûmavh's Lolth-worshipers. There ended the reign of House Chûmavh in Maerimydra.

===Beneath Raven's Bluff===
After the fall of Maermydra, the survivors relocated to Tower Chûmavhraele under the leadership of Marquise [[Dresimil Chûmavh]].{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|1595}} In the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, House Chûmavh attempted to activate an ancient [[drow]] ''[[mythal]]'', inadvertently releasing [[Jack Ravenwild]] in the process.{{Cite digital book/Prince of Ravens/Kindle|123}}
