        "Activities": "In the 14{{th}} Century [[DR]], Spysong operated throughout the [[Bloodstone Lands]] on behalf of King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] of Damara.\n\nAs of [[1480 DR]], Spysong was headed by [[Riordan Parnell]] and based out of the [[Cave of the Whispering Wind]] in the [[Galena Mountains]]. The organization was still active throughout Damara and [[Vaasa]], but had become dedicated to undermining and overthrowing the current King of Damara, [[Yarin Frostmantle]], who they believed to have been behind the death of Queen [[Brianne Dragonsbane]].{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|80}}",
        "Notable members": "*[[Kane]], who handled the long-range missions by way of his ''[[carpet of flying]]'' and spirit walking ability.\n*[[Celedon Kierney]], who kept a close watch on the [[Grandfather of Assassins]].\n*[[Riordan Parnell]], who with the help of some fifteen bards around [[Vaasa]] and Damara, coded important messages for Gareth into songs. Riordan also had a mobile strike force of a hundred fighters under his exclusive command, including twenty [[centaur]] cavalrymen.\n\nThere were also a number of [[ranger]]s who kept a close eye on and protected these three important leaders as much as they could when they were out on the land."
