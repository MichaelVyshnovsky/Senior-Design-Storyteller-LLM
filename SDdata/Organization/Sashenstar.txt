The '''Sashenstars''' were a [[nobility of Baldur's Gate|noble family]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] that had a long association with the city's [[Merchant's League]]. 

==Activities==
They owed their considerable wealth to their interests in commercial shipping, mining operations, and the textiles industry. 

==History==
[[File:Dabron Sashenstar.jpg|thumb|right|Dabron Sashenstar, head of the Sashenstar family ''circa'' [[1372 DR]]]]
Staring around the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, and continuing on to the [[Iron crisis]] that afflicted the [[Sword Coast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the Merchant's League was to compete with the rising [[Iron Throne]] mercantile group. The noble family even allowed their Baldurian estate, overseen by Aldeth Sashenstar, to be infiltrated by a group of Throne-controlled [[doppelganger]]s. As a result, the city's [[Council of Four]] banned the Merchant's League from operating in Baldur's Gate entirely. While the Sashenstar family renounced the organization in public, they maintained a working relationship with the league in secret.

House Sashenstar experienced years of decline until the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, when the family's prodigal son [[Dabron Sashenstar]] returned from an expedition to [[Sossal]], took over leadership of the family's businesses, and brought down the Iron Throne with the blessing from the Baldurian [[Council of Four]].<ref name="GHotR-p154-155>
