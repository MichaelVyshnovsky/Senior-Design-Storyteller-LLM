        "Activities": "The Thann family owned large plots of land to both the north and south of Waterdeep, including a villa, the [[Fair Winds]], that they rented out. The house had strong ties to [[Blackstaff Tower]], since Cassandra was publicly known as the sister of [[Khelben Arunsun the Younger]]. They also had strong ties with the [[Vintners', Distillers', & Brewers' Guild]].\n\nHouse Thann were closely allied with the [[Tethyr]]ian royal house and were engaged in the [[Reclamation of Tethyr]].

        "History": "House Thann was originally a [[Velen]]ese family that made its fortunes in the slave trade by taking slaves from the [[Skullport|Port of Shadow]] to the south. In [[1315 DR]], Rhammas convinced his father, [[Erktos Thann]], to abandon the slave trade. They then began focusing on land holdings, wine, and shipping. They continued some work in less reputable trades, however.\n\nIn the 1360s and 70s DR, the family gained the ire of the [[Shadow Thieves]] through their ties to [[Lhestyn Silmaeril Arunsun]] and their involvement in [[Riatavin]]'s secession to Tethyr. The Shadow Thieves were known to attack Thann holdings within the city of Waterdeep itself.",
