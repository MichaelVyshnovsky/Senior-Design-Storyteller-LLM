The Bushido () were a mercenary company from Kara-Tur in the mid–14 century DR.
The samurai Noro Amoto of Kozakura founded the Bushido army to defend the lands of Kara-Tur against the Tuigan Horde during the Horde Wars of the late 1350s DR. They fought capably, and continued marching westward.
After the Tuigans defeat, they were inspired by contact with the west to go on to Faerûn on a fact-finding mission, hoping to learn more about Faerûnian culture and military techniques. They planned to return to Kara-Tur and report back to Amotos master in Kozakura.
By the early 1360s DR, they were operating in Chessenta. The Bushido had fought two inconclusive battles against the Renegades.
Organized as an army, the Bushido comprised 60 heavy infantry, 60 medium cavalry, and 60 mounted archers, with a 181 members in total.
The Bushido operated as both a standing and a roaming army. Although curious about local customs and military matters, they made few attachments and remained transient.
They followed the code of bushido at all times and never looted the dead.
Usually, the Bushido set their footmen in strong position as a wall against foes while their archers harried them. The cavalry was used for a final attack or to cover a withdrawal. Messengers on horseback maintained contact between Noro and his three lieutenants.
Archers were equipped with composite shortbows, short sword, and leather armor. Cavalry wielded katanas and lances and wore banded mail. Footmen carried spears and wore brigandine armor.
The Bushido accepted only honorable work and were picky over what contracts they took. They charged 700 gold pieces per week for their services.
They were commanded by the samurai Noro Amoto with a firm hand and total authority tempered by wisdom and skill.
