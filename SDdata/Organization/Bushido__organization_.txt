The '''Bushido''' ({{Pronounce|boo|shee|do|refs=}}) were a mercenary company from [[Kara-Tur]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite card/AD&D Trading Cards/1993|119|Noro Amoto}}

==History==
The [[samurai]] [[Noro Amoto]] of [[Kozakura]] founded the Bushido army to defend the lands of Kara-Tur against the [[Tuigan Horde]] during the [[Horde Wars]] of the late 1350s [[DR]]. They fought capably, and continued marching westward.

After the Tuigan's defeat, they were inspired by contact with the west to go on to [[Faerûn]] on a fact-finding mission, hoping to learn more about Faerûnian culture and military techniques. They planned to return to Kara-Tur and report back to Amoto's master in Kozakura.

By the early 1360s [[DR]], they were operating in [[Chessenta]]. The Bushido had fought two inconclusive battles against the [[Renegades]].

==Organization==
Organized as an army, the Bushido comprised 60 heavy infantry, 60 medium cavalry, and 60 mounted archers, with a 181 members in total.

==Activities==
The Bushido operated as both a standing and a roaming army. Although curious about local customs and military matters, they made few attachments and remained transient.

They followed the code of [[bushido]] at all times and never looted the dead.

==Tactics==
Usually, the Bushido set their footmen in strong position as a wall against foes while their archers harried them. The cavalry was used for a final attack or to cover a withdrawal. Messengers on horseback maintained contact between Noro and his three lieutenants.

==Equipment==
Archers were equipped with [[composite shortbow]]s, [[short sword]], and [[leather armor]]. Cavalry wielded [[katana]]s and [[lance]]s and wore [[banded mail]]. Footmen carried [[spear]]s and wore [[brigandine]] armor.

==Contracts==
The Bushido accepted only honorable work and were picky over what contracts they took. They charged 700 [[gold piece]]s per week for their services.

==Leadership==
They were commanded by the samurai Noro Amoto with a firm hand and total authority tempered by wisdom and skill.
