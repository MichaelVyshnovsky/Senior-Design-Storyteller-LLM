'''Orthwood''' was a noble house of [[Cormyr]].{{Cite dragon annual/2000/After the Dragon: The Kingdom of Cormyr Today|62,65}}

==History==
The House was stripped of its nobility in the {{YearlinkName|1227}}, when [[Nelnar Orthwood]] discovered his son [[Nars Orthwood|Nars]] was plotting against the Crown and the son killed the father. The family lands and wealth were taken by the Crown to compensate their creditors. Nelnar's wife and daughters were allowed to say in a house owned by the Crown on the east side of the [[Starwater River]] and were given an annual stipend to provide a modest life.{{Cite dragon/281/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr, Part 4|78}}

The House regained its place in the Cormyrean nobility in the 14{{th}} century{{Cite dragon annual/2000/After the Dragon: The Kingdom of Cormyr Today|67}} as evidenced by [[Asbras Orthwood]], a Knight Royal.
