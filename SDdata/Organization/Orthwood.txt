The House was stripped of its nobility in the , when Nelnar Orthwood discovered his son Nars was plotting against the Crown and the son killed the father. The family lands and wealth were taken by the Crown to compensate their creditors.

The House regained its place in the Cormyrean nobility in the 14 century as evidenced by Asbras Orthwood, a Knight Royal.
