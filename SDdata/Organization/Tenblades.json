        "History": "The Tenblades used their own wealth to fund the construction of the fortress of [[Darmshall]]. Darmshall's construction was prompted by the leader of the Tenblades, [[Romas Thunderclap]], after two of their members were murdered. Romas figured the presence of the fortress would deter future attacks in the region. Darmshall's defenses were well-constructed, as even [[Zhengyi]] could not conquer the keep."
