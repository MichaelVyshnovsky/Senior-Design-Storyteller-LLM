The '''Acolytes of Corruption''' were a faction within the [[Order of Blue Fire]] that worshiped the [[Spellplague]] at the [[Cathedral of Madness]] in the [[Chasm]] of [[Neverwinter]].

==Possessions==
The Acolytes carried [[crystal]] [[talisman]]s that allowed them to bypass the protective [[ward]]s within the Cathedral of Madness.

==History==
Members of the Order of Blue Fire were drawn to the Chasm by rumors of [[Spellplague]] erupting from within the ruined [[Cathedral of Mystra (Neverwinter)|Cathedral of Mystra]]. Upon arriving, they declared the Cathedral to be a holy site and began spreading a message of submission to the Spellplague. Their mad preaching drew the attention and ire of [[Scar Company]], and under the direction of [[Quorthon]], an [[adventurer]] was sent to eliminate the Acolytes.

==Members==
The Acolytes included enforcers, [[foulspawn]] and [[plaguechanged]] minions, and [[accordant|Blue Fire Accordant]]s, who were powerful [[Spellplague disciple]]s.

The leader of the Acolytes was [[Senobith the Corruptor]], and beneath her were four lieutenants: [[Hazdrobel]], [[Nala (Order of Blue Fire|Nala]], [[Onfrey]], and [[Thormund]].
