The '''Shadovar''', sometimes pluralized as '''Shadovars''', were the inhabitants of [[Thultanthar]], also known as the City of Shade. before [[the Return|returning]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] and reestablishing a [[Netherese]] presence in [[Faerûn]].
{{Quote|...not all Shadovar are [[shade]]s, and not all shades are Shadovar. A Shadovar is a citizen of [[Shade Enclave]].|[[Brennus Tanthul]], to [[Malygris]].}}

==Etymology==
The term "Shadovar" meant "of the shades" in [[Loross]].

==Activities==
The Shadovar had many skilled [[wizard]]s and powerful [[sorcerer]]s among their number, 
 They held practitioners of the [[arcane arts]] in the highest regard, especially those that wielded the powers of [[shadow magic]].

They used their arcane powers to scry the entirety of [[Faerûn]], constantly examining and scrutinizing their new neighbors on the [[Prime Material plane]].

==Society==
===Beliefs===
They believed that [[Anauroch]] was their undisputed domain, and used their spells to keep the sandstorms of the desert at bay.

===Culture===
The Shadovar were a strong-willed people that tolerated no opposition to their ambitions. believing themselves destined for greatness and superior to the "weak and worthless" masses of the Realms. Conversely, Shadovar culture was seen as domineering and warlike by others.

It was the goal of many devoted Shadovar to undergo transformation into a [[shade]], at the discretion of the [[Princes of Shade]].

All Shadovar spoke the [[Netherese language|ancestral language]] of ancient Netheril, while some few learned the [[Common]] trade tongue of the Realms.

Most Shadovar were forbidden from leaving Thultanthar without escort, save for the cases of military officers or the princes themselves.

===Religion===
The Shadovar dedicated the entirety of their society to the veneration of [[Shar]], and relied exclusively upon her blessing over any other false deity. Worship of the Lady of Loss in Thultanthar had endured for over a millennia and a half, predating the enclave's entrance to the Plane of Shadow.

While all Shadovar paid service to Shar, not all could be considered "true believers". Some merely used their faith as a means to achieve their own personal ambitions.

==Possessions==
Their weapons and armaments were considered antiques, which was appropriate considering their centuries-long absence from Toril.

==History==
When [[Telamont Tanthul]] moved Thultanthar to the Plane of Shadow, their mythal was infused with the power of the [[Shadow Weave]] and protected by the goddess Shar. After centuries in the Plane of Shadow, the ruling class of the City of Shade became twisted, dark, humanoid creatures referred to as [[shade]]s.

On [[Hammer 1]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, Thultanthar returned to the Realms above the [[Dire Wood]],

In response to this growing opposition from the nation of [[Cormyr]] and organizations like the [[Harpers]], and [[Helm's Hold]].

The Shadovar people began excavations across Anauroch and the [[Western Heartlands]], looking for long-lost repositories of ancient Netherese lore or artifacts from the Empire of Magic. Over time, the Shadovar once again came to be known among others as Netherese, and the terms became largely interchangeable, even if not entirely accurate.

==Rumors & Legends==
In the years following the return of Thultanthar, people from across the [[Heartlands]] whispered amongst themselves that one day the Shadovar would conquer [[Cormyr]], the [[Silver Marches]] or the [[Dalelands]], while being protected from the harsh Anauroch around them. These pessimistic folks prophesied the Anauroch desert would be overrun by terrible monsters, tyrannical wizards, and horrific undead.

==Notable Shadovar==
* [[Herzgo Alegni]],  the [[tiefling]] that led the Shadovar's search for the lost enclave of [[Xinlenal]].
* [[Maerandor]], an agent of High Prince [[Telamont Tanthul]].
