The Mages of Saruun was a merchant wizards guild that operated out of the Seven-Pillared Hall in Cormyr. The organization was shrouded in mystery, as even its most high-ranking members were unknown. Their operations were considered illegal, as they werent officially sanctioned by the Forest Kingdom.
In 1454 DR, three wizards discovered the ruins of Saruun Khel in the Thunderspire Mountain, while seeking forgotten treasures. Among the magic items they recovered were several magic amulets, which allowed them to control the bronze warders, minotaur constructs built in the citys heyday. The wizards used the bronze warders to clear the upper level of the ruins, establishing a stronghold thereâ€”the Seven-Pillared Hall, and founded the order of the Mages of Saruun.
The Mages of Saruun only cared about their profitable business with the merchants of the Underdark. As they werent officially sanctioned by Cormyrs authorities, the Mages didnt operated outside of the Seven-Pillared Hall and allowed only a few trusted merchants from the surface to do business with them in hopes to avoid Cormyrs attention, fearing the Forest Kingdom would shut down their profitable operation if they knew about them.
