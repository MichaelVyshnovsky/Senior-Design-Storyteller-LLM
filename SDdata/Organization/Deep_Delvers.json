        "mainbody": "The Deep Delvers were young heirs of the Waterdhavian nobility adventuring in Undermountain.\nBeing bored young men, the Delvers would seek excitement by exploring Undermountain. They were looking for danger and dares, and usually brought back trophies and other tokens proving their achievements. They would sometimes play pranks on other adventurers, which would gain them fame among their companions.\nWhen they were not attempting daring deeds, the Delvers could be found in the Yawning Portal drinking and telling the tales of their adventures.\nWhen entering Undermountain, the Delvers would always bring with them the up fee, which was paid to be hauled back up in the Yawning Portal at the end of their journey.\n* Bleys Crommor\n* Dundald Gost\n* Myrnd Gundwynd\n* Horth Hunabar\n* Jandal Ilzimmer\n* Morgunn Lathkule\n* Shauban Zulpair"
