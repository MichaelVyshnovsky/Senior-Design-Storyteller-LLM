The '''Council of Guilds''' ran the daily affairs of [[Daggerford]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
Imitating the masked [[Lords of Waterdeep]], the council members wore masks and shrouded themselves in robes to hide their identities at council meetings, but everyone in Daggerford knew who the council members were.

The council consisted of the guildmasters of the town's trade guilds, Merchant's Guild, Jeweler's Congress, Whitesmiths' Guild, Tailors' Federation, Tanners' Council, Physicians' Order, Taverners' Confederation, ScribesÂ’ Friendship, Sorceller's Encapsulate, Farmers' Society, Animal Handlers' Affiliation, and Carpenters' League, and likely not the self-styled guilds of the Thieves' Brotherhood

==Notable Members==
* [[Derval Ironeater]], guildmaster of the blacksmith's guild
* [[Maerovyna]], chief priestess of the [[Harvest House]]
* [[Liam Sunmist]], Lightlord of the [[Morninglow Tower]]
* [[Bando]] the Lame, priest of [[Tymora]]
* [[Sherlen Spearslayer]], the head of the [[Daggerford militia]]
