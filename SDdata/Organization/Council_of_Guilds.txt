The Council of Guilds ran the daily affairs of Daggerford in the 14 century DR.
Imitating the masked Lords of Waterdeep, the council members wore masks and shrouded themselves in robes to hide their identities at council meetings, but everyone in Daggerford knew who the council members were.
The council consisted of the guildmasters of the towns trade guilds, Merchants Guild, Jewelers Congress, Whitesmiths Guild, Tailors Federation, Tanners Council, Physicians Order, Taverners Confederation, ScribesÂ’ Friendship, Sorcellers Encapsulate, Farmers Society, Animal Handlers Affiliation, and Carpenters League, and likely not the self-styled guilds of the Thieves Brotherhood
