        "mainbody": "The Ministry of Art, colloquially known as the Ministry of Magic, was a governing body consisting of arcane spellcasters, created in the city of Ravens Bluff in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe Ministry of Art consisted of fourteen Seats abjuration, alteration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, illusion, invocation, necromancy, fire, water, earth, air, wild magic, and wizardry. The Seats represented magical specializations, and the Seat of wizardry was reserved for those who practiced magic with no focus on one specific school or aspect. The fourteenth Seat was also added to avoid Beshabas unlucky number thirteen. No Seats were referred to by their numbers except for the fourteenth Seat&mdashwizardry, and the thirteenth Seat&mdashwild magic. The term \"first Seat\" was always only used in reference to the Seat held by the Ministrys elected speaker. The first Seat represented the Ministry in the Council of Lords of Ravens Bluff.\nAll Seats were held by powerful mage residents of Ravens Bluff however, recent transplants were eligible. A significant number of the Ministrys Seats was filled by members of the Wizards Guild, who, in turn, when accepting the position, were to forgo all past loyalties, but to the city of Ravens Bluff.\nThe Ministry of Magic was responsible for handling all things magical on behalf of the Ravens Bluff government. These tasks included investigation, magical research, subtle magical interrogations, lawmaking, issuing of magical permits and inspections of enchanted items,  and divination, as well as scrying during the times of war.\nthumb|The location of the Ministry of Magic in the Southside.|425x425px\nThe Ministry of Art headquarters was located in the Tlasbras neighborhood of the Southside district of Ravens Bluff. The neighborhood was also home to most members of the Ministry. The compound was a large building nestled between Deepaxe Way to the east, Whisper Late to the west, and Conant Court to the north.\nHistorically, the Ministry of Art and the other major magical institution&mdashthe Wizards Guild, were bitter rivals, often quietly hostile and sometimes openly erupting in violence. Visitors to Ravens Bluff could easily confuse the two organizations. The Ministry mages, or the \"Mins\", were members of the government, while the spellcasters of the Wizards Guild, or the \"Guilders\", were allied with the city but retained autonomy and independence. Both organizations were designed to function in close parallels to eachother.\nThe Ministry of Art was formed shortly before Flamerule of the , during the rule of Lord Mayor Charles Oliver OKane. The Lord Mayors order to form this new government body was met with staunch opposition from some, including Sirrus Melander, the leader of the citys Clerical Circle. He believed that mages had no place in governing Ravens Bluff. Another opponent of its formation was Saldo Presto of the Diviners Guild, who was disgruntled over a non-guild diviner being assigned to the Ministry. Saldo called the formation to be careless and demanded that appointments to the Ministry be electoral. Others complained that the distribution of male and female members of the Ministry was artificial, while others complained that most of them were humans, and Gnomes of Ravens Bluff were convinced that only a gnome could adequately represent illusion magic, yet non-gnomes often pointed out that the best illusionist mages tended to be humans. It was a significant concern that the Lord Mayors agenda was completely political rather than legislative.\nIn Alturiak of the , several giant slug emerged from under the city and began menacing Ravens Bluff. The representatives of the Ministry of Art announced via the Ravens Bluff Trumpeter that these creatures inhabited subterranean depths and their appearance on the surface was uncanny. Later the same year, the citys famed magic shop, Chemcheaux 223, was destroyed in a disaster of magical nature. The Ministry of Art vowed to investigate the alleged incident and uncover the truth of the event. The Ministry expressed hope in their statement to Ravens Bluff Trumpeter that another sagely organization would open a magic shop in Ravens Bluff to fill the niche.\nThe city of Ravens Bluff was shaken by Lord Mayor Charles Oliver OKanes adduction in Flamerule of the , the mysterious diviner mage named Oracle from the Ministry was the first to arrive to the crime scene, mere moments before the City Watch. The diviner kept his findings to himself and refused to comment on to Ravens Bluff Trumpeter. As the war with warlord Myrkyssa Jelan raged across the Vast, Ministry of Art became stretched thin using numerous layers of protective magics to shield the city from being scried and teleported into.\nIn Ches of the , Ravens Bluff Trumpeter announced the unification of the Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild. The two wizardly organizations allied their functions and leadership under a new name – Guild of Magical Arts. The unification was a desperate act caused by the war with Myrkyssa Jelan that taxed both organizations magic and resources really. The Ministry of Art and Wizards Guild often found themselves working for the same goals and on the same problems without consulting with eachother or pooling resources. All Ministry seats and ranking members of the guild unanimously approved of the merger. Each Seat began to coach and lead Wizards Guilds members who specialized in the same school of magic, and the Archmage of the Wizards Guild Alcides Von Tighe headed the new organizational structure. This unification was to be temporary until the conclusion of the war in the Vast. The Guild of Magical Arts did not last. It was barely two months old when Ravens Bluff Trumpeter reported its disassembly in Tarsakh. Ministers began leaving the joined organization to reform the Ministry of Art after becoming quickly disillusioned with Alcides Von Tighes leadership. Those seats that remained with the Guild of Magical Arts at the time were alteration (Emellin), conjuration (Alskander), invocation (Variance Klane), necromancy (Begoas), and wild magic. However, the wild magic Seats position was a forced one as Glora Vano was on the run after being accused of treason after aiding Myrkyssa Jelan. Both organizations were unsure of how to proceed, and no plans for recruiting new Ministers were made.\nIn Mirtul, 1370 DR, Begoas the Inquisitive was the only Minister among those elected to stay with the Guild of Magical Arts who returned to the Ministry of Art. Back in the Seat of necromancy, Begoas headed an investigation and search for the traitor  Glora Vano. His investigation uncovered an ancient tomb that was believed to be the ex-Ministers hideout. The Ministry of Art disclosed the tombs location to any and all adventurers willing to bring Glora Vano to justice. By Flamerule of the same year, it was decided that the Ministry of Art was to fill the Seats left open by the Ministers who stayed with the Guild of Magical Arts. The new additions were named the Junior Ministers Nuelman the Oracle who took the Seat of illusion, Grimalkin – the Seat of divination, Cordwainer – the Seat of enchantment, and Sam Shock – the Seat of abjuration. Minister Glora Vano was at last officially suspended from the organization, with Gideon being assigned as the temporary Minister of wild magic.\nAs the war with Myrkyssa Jelan was over, another blight came upon Ravens Bluff in the form of a planar threat. In Tarsakh of the , tanarri targeted the Living City. The Ministry of Art and the Mages Guild issued a rare joint statement that both organizations were to cease all summoning magics until the field threat was over. The wizards suspected one of their own to be behind tanarri summoning within Ravens Bluff. In Flamerule of the same year, Dean of the Ministry of Art for Fire Elementalism Azoth Malishar retired from active duty after helping the recently erupted Firestorm Mountain to settle down. Azoths health was damaged by the ordeal. The same month was marked by a heist of the Ministrys offices. Sarah DeMarcus stole a powerful enchanted helm to try and brainwash her misguided husband into a life of evil and villainy.\nThe following month, mages from the Ministry of Art were summoned to verify the authenticity of mithril coins from a place in another world called Glantri. The coins came from a mammoth tax payment done by Vernon Condor to the city of Ravens Bluff. The authenticity was confirmed as well as some minor enchantments placed on the coins were discovered by Oracle, the recently reinstated Minister of Divination. During that period of time, a magical phenomenon known as Soulstorm was ravaging the city, caused by the presence of the Veil in Ravens Bluff. Both Ministry of Art and the Wizards Guild were at their wits end, unable to dispose is magics. The two organizations announced that casting of any conjuration/summoning spell or similar magic was now illegal due to the raging disaster. The law was to remain in place until the Soulstorm crisis was resolved. The Soulstorm began to dissipate in Eleint of 1371 DR but by another joint announcement, both Ministry of Art and the Wizards Guild reiterated that the ban would stay in place until further notice. In Marpenoth, Soulstorm was completely gone, and both wizardly organizations vowed to investigate its long-lasting effects on Ravens Bluff, if any.
