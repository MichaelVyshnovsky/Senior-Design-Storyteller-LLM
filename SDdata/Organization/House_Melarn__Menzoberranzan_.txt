House Melarn was the sixth house of Menzoberranzan by the end of 1484 DR.
The House Melarn compound was located in Lolths Web—webs strung hundreds of feet off the cavern floor—in West Wall in Menzoberranzan. It was constructed after the unification of House Horlbar and House Kenafin with the expertise of drow refugees from Ched Nasad. The webs were lined with faerie fire. The compound took the form of a shell, with a shrine to Lolth in the center, nobles rooms around that, and other living quarters in the outer rings. The compound was guarded by spiders and driders, as well as drow guards.
House Melarn was known as one of the Menzoberranyr houses most fanatical to Lolth. Matron Zhindia Melarn believed such fanaticism, including calling out other houses apparent blasphemy, would bring Lolths favor upon her. However, most houses resented House Melarn because of their behavior.
The house was strong militarily, but did not hire outsiders such as Bregan Daerthe for fears concerning their loyalty.
House Melarn, as well as House Barrison DelArmgo, was using the abandoned House DoUrden complex as training grounds for its drow soldiers and driders. The troops were kicked out by Bregan Daerthe under the command of House Baenre.
House Melarn was formed circa 1383 DR by the merging of House Horlbar and House Kenafin.
At the beginning of 1484 DR, House Melarn was the seventh house of Menzoberranzan. After House Xorlarrin left for QXorlarrin, they become the sixth house.
Members of House Melarn were known as the "Melarni." In addition to about 340 drow members, a number of driders served the house. The Melarni were known for their religious zeal even their male wizards were often obsessed with spiders, becoming arachnomancers. Other elite fighters (male and female) trained to protect priestesses with their lives these were called Dread Fangs of Halisstra.
Most of the drow were Menzoberranyr however, there were a number of survivors from the original House Melarn who joined the house.
