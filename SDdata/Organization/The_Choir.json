        "Members": "Members of the Choir had the ability to influence others through their strange songs.  The Choir used wolf-like spellplague changed creatures known as [[Oenath|Oenaths]] to track prey in the wilds.",
        "Activities": "In [[1479 DR]] members of the cult traveled to [[Airspur]] where they recruited a number of Airspur's residents.  Those who didn't travel back to [[Tohrepur]] with the Choir were kidnapped.  The Choir was disbanded in 1479 DR when a small group of adventurers led by [[Uthalion]] traveled to the cult's shrine in Tohrepur and killed the Choir's leader, [[Khault|Lord Khault]]."
