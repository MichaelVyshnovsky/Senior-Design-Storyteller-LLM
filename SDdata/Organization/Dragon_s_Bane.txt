The Dragons Bane was a group of adventurers active in Unther during the mid–14 century DR.
The adventuring group was famous for confronting the venerable red dragon Guyanothaz in his lair on Mount Temmikant in the Smoky Mountains where they attacked him, blinded him, and absconded with most of his treasure.
