The '''Dragon's Bane''' was a group of [[adventurer]]s active in [[Unther]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The adventuring group was famous for confronting the venerable [[red dragon]] [[Guyanothaz]] in his lair on [[Mount Temmikant]] in the [[Smoky Mountains]] where they attacked him, blinded him, and absconded with most of his treasure.
