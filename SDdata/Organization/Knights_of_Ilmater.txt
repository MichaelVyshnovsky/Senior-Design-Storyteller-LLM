The Knights of Ilmater were a knightly order of paladins devoted to Ilmater, the Broken God
The order comprised fifty paladins who fought together under a red-and-grey banner bearing a holy symbol of Ilmater. An ultra-heavy cavalry unit, they were an incredibly dangerous force on the battlefield.
The Knights journeyed constantly from battle to battle, always seeking a worthy cause to fight for. They had no bases or homes, choosing to live without this security or comfort, as per their faith.
Under the leadership of the suicidally brave Korr of Ilmater, in the Year of the Wyvern, 1363 DR, the Knights of Ilmater came to Daggerfords side and joined its alliance during the Second Dragonspear War against the forces of Dragonspear Castle.
