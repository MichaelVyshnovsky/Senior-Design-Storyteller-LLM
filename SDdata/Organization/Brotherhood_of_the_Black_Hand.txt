The Brotherhood of the Black Hand, also known as the Brothers of the Black Hand was a cadre of evil wizards originally based in Ascalhorn in the High Forest. They worshiped Bane, whose title and symbol was a black hand.
The Brotherhood was established in Ascalhorn shortly after the fall of Myth Drannor, at the guidance of the lich Aumvor the Undying, as part of his plan to revive Netherils spirit of spellcasting, arcane research, and experimentation in Netherese bloodlines.
In 765 DR their existence was discovered by the Ascalhi authorites and exiled from the city. A year later they resurfaced in Silverymoon,
The surviving members of the brotherhood fled back to Ascalhorn, later becoming embroiled in the escalating conflicts and power plays among the citys wizards. Their safehouse in Ascalhorn would fall to the machinations of the wizards and devils there, with their last surviving members dying in 856 DR, The only thing of theirs to go undiscovered was a hidden underground vault, later known as the Crypt of the Black Hand, where their bones and treasures apparently remained by the midâ€“14 century DR.
