The '''Brotherhood of the Black Hand''', also known as the '''Brothers of the Black Hand''' was a cadre of evil [[wizard]]s originally based in [[Ascalhorn]] in the [[High Forest]]. They worshiped [[Bane]], whose title and symbol was a black hand.


==History==
The Brotherhood was established in Ascalhorn shortly after the fall of [[Myth Drannor]],{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 4}} at the guidance of the [[lich]] [[Aumvor|Aumvor the Undying]], as part of his plan to revive [[Netheril]]'s spirit of spellcasting, arcane research, and experimentation in [[Netherese]] bloodlines.

In [[765 DR]] their existence was discovered by the Ascalhi authorites and exiled from the city. A year later they resurfaced in [[Silverymoon]],

The surviving members of the brotherhood fled back to Ascalhorn, later becoming embroiled in the escalating conflicts and power plays among the city's wizards. Their safehouse in Ascalhorn would fall to the machinations of the wizards and [[devil]]s there, with their last surviving members dying in [[856 DR]], The only thing of theirs to go undiscovered was a hidden underground vault, later known as the Crypt of the Black Hand, where their bones and treasures apparently remained by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref>
