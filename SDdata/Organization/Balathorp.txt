The '''Balathorps''' were a noble family from the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. While they maintained significant wealth, despite expensive tastes, excessive spending and a rather neglectful attitude towards their holdings, they had been otherwise ravaged by ill-fortune. As of [[1370 DR]], their only surviving direct-lineage member was the family's youngest son and heir, Lord [[Dustan Balathorp]].

Their family motto was: "my sword my tongue".

==Activities==
One of their businesses involved importing [[paper]] and dried rice-[[noodles]] from cities along the southern shore of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. While he had since stopped, Lord Dunstan used to personally accompany those trips for what was cruelly referred to as "cousin-acquiring trips" by some of the Ravenian aristocracy. Under Dunstan's stewardship, the family's manor was full of "Balathorp blades", male poets and [[bard]]s whose skills were in high demand at noble revels within the city. Along with these men, to whom Dunstan was particularly close, were the young lord's "cousins": scantily clad women who had been brought into a city, distinguished by the black-ribbon chokers they wore around their neck, which bore the Balathorp family seal. 

==Members==
*[[Dunstan Balathorp]]: Lord Dunstan was the epitome of the Bluff's young, upstart nobility of the late 1300s DR. He carried himself as a flamboyant spectacle, completely carefree and full of wit and acting on his grand whims.

==History==
Although it was not known how the former Lord and Lady Balathorp died, tragedy was known to have struck the house on more that one occasion. The family's second-eldest son, along with his own entire family perished in a shipwreck some years prior to Dunstan's ascendance. Yet another of his brothers was poisoned by some vengeful lover, shortly after he had taken his wife's hand in marriage.
