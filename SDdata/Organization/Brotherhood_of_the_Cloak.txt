The '''Brotherhood of the Cloak''', known also as '''the Cloaks''', was a group of all the non-novice [[wizard]]s and [[sorcerer]]s within the city of [[Mulmaster]].

==Activities==
Created for the near-singular purpose of controlling the power of [[magic]] within the city, all arcane spellcasters with any significant experience were required to join the Brotherhood under penalty of exile. Regardless of this consolidation of power, the Brotherhood was tasked with the protection of the High Blade ([[Rassendyll Uoumdolphin]] around [[1373 DR]]).

==Ranks==
Along with the many regular members of the Brotherhood of the Cloak, there were 35 higher-up members referred to as the Senior Cloaks.

==Non-Members==
As only foreign visitors were allowed to cast [[spell]]s within Mulmaster, some representatives of other nations living within the city, such as members of the [[Red Wizards of Thay]] or magic-wielding [[Zhentarim|Zhents]], were not required to join the cloaks.

==Members==
* [[Thurndan Tallwand]], the Senior Cloak of the brotherhood in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].
* [[Volothamp Geddarm]] received a honorary membership with the Cloak from Thurndan Tallwand himself.
