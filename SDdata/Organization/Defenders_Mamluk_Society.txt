The Defenders Mamluk Society, also known as the Defenders, was a military organization in Zakhara.
The Defenders were charged with the protection and defense of mighty Qudra.
The Defenders were led by Akir Abd al-Himaya.
Since the defense of the city was the sole task, the Defenders were rarely encountered outside of her walls.
