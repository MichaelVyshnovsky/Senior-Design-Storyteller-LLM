The Thieves Patrol was the name given to the group of wandering ghosts that could be spotted in the Battle of Bones.
The ghosts emerged from their resting place on the night of each new moon, only to be trampled again before dawn by the ghosts of those who acidentally killed them centuries ago.
Before the Battle of Bones occurred, a group of men decided to wait out the battle in order to loot the corpses of the fallen.  The men gave themselves superficial injuries and lay down to play dead in a natural depression to wait for the battle to end. As fate would have it, the battle raged furiously over the site they chose to hide in, being taken and retaken by both sides of the conflict.  All of the hiding men were trampled to death in their pit.
