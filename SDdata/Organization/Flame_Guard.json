        "mainbody": "The '''Flame Guard''' was an elite bodyguard in [[Suldolphor]] the Golden City in far eastern [[Calimshan]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Organization": "The Flame Guard protected and enforced the law of Suldophor's ruling [[olanger]], who was [[Daeranatha Dorluu]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. They also paid and oversaw Suldophor's militiaâ€”the [[Swords of Suldolphor]]. The Flame Guard was commanded by a pair of grizzled veterans named [[Golordin Maerthringul]]  and [[Jalasta Kelelder]]. Both held the rank of High Sword. The Flame Guard numbered 2,000 soldiers who were quartered in [[Elaph's Tower]] and [[Corondor's Tower]] in the city. A typical member of the Flame Guard fought from horseback in [[plate armor]] wielding a [[lance]], [[sword]], and [[crossbow]].\n\nThe Flame Guard was also responsible for finding Suldophor's next olanger as decreed by [[Waukeen]], which was a bit of a controversy given the aging state of Daeranatha and Waukeen's silence since the [[Time of Troubles]]."
