        "History": "The order was formed some years before the {{YearlinkName|1235}}. Its members were [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s who took arms against the increased attacks from [[orc]]s along the [[Sword Coast]]. To battle the multitudes of battles against the savage [[humanoid]]s, the Sword Coast Legion was given a set of [[enchanted]] [[mace]]s known as the ''[[Fist of the Legion|Fists of the Legion]]''. It was unknown how long the Sword Coast Legion remained active, but their ''Fists of the Legion'' carried the organization's legacy into the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
