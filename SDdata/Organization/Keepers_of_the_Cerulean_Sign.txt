The Keepers of the Cerulean Sign were an ancient order dedicated to combating aberrations from the Far Realm.
The Keepers were organized into independent groups of chapterhouses and lone individuals. By 1479 DR, most chapterhouses had been overrun and destroyed.
They possessed amulets that grew colder in the presence of aberrations. 
They were an ancient order that also had forces in the Feywild overlooking a border into the Far Realm.
