The Corsair's fleet comprised fifteen ships in [[1370 DR]] and they had their own private docks at the port.\n\nThe crew was well paid and well equipped as they made money not only by raiding coastal navies and competitor crews, but also through the dock fees of visiting ships at the port. Members received good pay to prevent their betrayal.",
