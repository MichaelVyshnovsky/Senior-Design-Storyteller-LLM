The '''Taramir chaka''' was one of the prominent [[chaka]]s in the nation of [[Estagund]], the [[Shining Lands]], in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The Taramir chaka was in charge of garbage collection across most of the cities in [[Estagund]]. The civil services in Estagund, such as sanitation, were handled by private chakas who operated under contracts.
