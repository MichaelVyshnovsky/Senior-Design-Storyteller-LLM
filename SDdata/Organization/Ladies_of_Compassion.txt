The '''Ladies of Compassion''' were [[Lesser Immortals]] in the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]] who served the goddess [[Kwan Ying]].

==Description==
These [[spirit]]s appeared as dignified maidens wearing white robes. They wore their long hair loose. They were seen carrying white cloths of [[silk]] for the binding of wounds.

==Activities==
The role of the White Ladies was to ease pain and suffering among both mortals and immortals, doing the bidding of Kwan Ying.

==History==
In [[1356 DR|Shou Year 2606 (1356 DR)]], the [[kensai]] [[An Ching Wang]] was visited by a Lady of Compassion, who encouraged her to follow her lover on his journey of repentance, telling her, "Follow your heart and things will work out."
