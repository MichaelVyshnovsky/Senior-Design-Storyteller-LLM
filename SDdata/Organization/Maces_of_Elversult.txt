They aided in the temporary defeat the undead monstrosity, sending its dormant form into the waters of Hillshadow Lake for a time, until it rose back back into existence. The Maces held it at bay once again, utilizing their archers and ballistae mounted upon Baldagar Manor, so that it could be destroyed for good by the Harper witch Ruha.
