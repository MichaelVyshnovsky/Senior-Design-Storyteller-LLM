The '''Maces''' were the guardsmen that served as protectors of the city of [[Elversult]].

==Organization==
The approximately 3,500 guards of the Maces were led by Commander [[Pierstar Hallowhand]].

==Activities==
During typical days of service, guardsmen of the Maces patrolled the streets of Elversult in small patrols of five members each.

Due to the great many smugglers that operated out of Elversult, members of the Maces were exceptionally adept at ferreting out those kinds of illicit activities.

==Tactics==
Members of the maces were recruited rather than conscripted.

==Possessions==
They equipped themselves with [[scale mail]] armor and their namesake [[mace|blunt weapons]]. Each guardsman carried a [[whistle (item)|whistle]] that they used to call out threats to their fellows, using varying sounds depending on the source of the danger.

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|1364}}, the Maces defended their city against the threat of the [[black dragon|black]] [[dracolich]] [[Hethcypressarvil]]. They aided in the temporary defeat the undead monstrosity, sending its dormant form into the waters of [[Hillshadow Lake]] for a time, until it rose back back into existence. The Maces held it at bay once again, utilizing their archers and [[ballista]]e mounted upon [[Baldagar Manor]], so that it could be destroyed for good by the [[Harper]] witch [[Ruha]].
