        "mainbody": "The Dukars  were a group of Serôsian wizards who used coral implants to channel their magic. Their goal was the protection of Serôs from all kinds of menaces and to promote peace and harmony between all races.\nThe dukars were divided into five orders Nantari, Jhimar, Kupav, Maalirn, and Numos. Furthermore, two different dukar paths existed the lorekeeper and the peacekeeper.\nThe order of Nantari was destroyed in early fighting between the orders and the order of Jhimar died out before the 1370s DR.\nAn early form of dukars existed among the elven high mages in Cormanthor, but they evolved further after migrating to Serôs. The true dukars were founded by the triton Dukar, the near-mythical first Grand Master and teacher of the Four Founders, during the early days of ancient Aryselmalyr. After 8,000 years, they surveyed the peace and harmony of Serôs, gathering in their ranks beings of many races, including whales, dolphins, storm giants, and even koalinth and ixitxachitl.\nHowever, internal strife emerged among the dukars and they fought among themselves until they disappeared. However, a small group of dukars survived until 1369 DR and revealed themselves again during the Twelfth Serôs War.\nBy that point, they were nearly forgotten. Out of the four orders, Jhimar was already gone, and the entire orders number was dwindling away. While they did try to gain new recruits to avoid dying out,\n* Dasin a young elf who traveled from Faenasuor to Myth Nantar\n* Dinama former Sembian noble who joined the Order of Maalirn \n* Jorunhast the exiled High Wizard of Cormyr\n* KaioaTara a Shalarin girl from Myth Nantar\n* Paxas a triton from Myth Nantar\n* Radom the final remaining member of the Order of Jhimari\n* Tuuuacol the shalarin dukar who saved the life of Vhaemas"
