The '''Carthclarr''' clan was one of the powerful [[Onsruur]] (council of lords) families in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. This elite group was one of the twenty most wealthy and influential familes in the Iron City.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|86-87}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 65: Khôltar, Part 16, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 3}}

==Organization==
The Carthclarrs had very angular features and were considered good looking. They carried themselves well and put on airs, denigrating those around them with snide comments and observations. They were well educated, and some members practiced [[the Art]]. Their plots against family rivals were executed over long periods of time, putting their skill as subtle manipulators to good use. For quicker results, they were not above the use of [[poison]]s.

==Activities==
Many of their business ventures were in the cities on the coast of the [[Shining Sea]], in countries such as [[Tashalar]], [[Lapaliiya]], and [[Calimshan]].
