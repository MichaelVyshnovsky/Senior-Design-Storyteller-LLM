        "mainbody": "The Court of Rhythm was a religious organization in Zakhara whose members followed the teachings of Hajama, the Zakharan god of courage.\nThe Court of Rhythm favored the short sword.\nMystics of the Court of Rhythm gained their spiritual power through pounding drums in rhythm, usually with many others of their organization. They were popular among dancing groups, but singing and chanting mystics did not care for them.\nMembers of the Court of Rhythm were found within the Ruined Kingdoms, in Afyal, and scattered throughout the Crowded Sea."
