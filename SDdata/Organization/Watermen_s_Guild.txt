The '''Watermen's Guild''' was a guild located within the city of [[Daggerford]] in the [[Western Heartlands]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Base of Operations==
Their guildhall, which was called [[Watermen's Circle]], was located in southern Daggerford in between [[Wall Street (Daggerford)|Wall Street]] and [[Kaoth Alley]] near the [[River Gate]].{{Cite interactive atlas|3990 Daggerford}}

==Activities==
Members of the Watermen's Guild were responsible for supplying drinking water for Daggerford, travelling a few hundred yards upstream along the [[Delimbiyr River]] to collect fresh water. The guild also aided in suppressing fires and ensuring the city's drainage system was functioning properly.

Guildmembers always wore blue caps and used blue carts to haul water.
