The Watermens Guild was a guild located within the city of Daggerford in the Western Heartlands in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.
Their guildhall, which was called Watermens Circle, was located in southern Daggerford in between Wall Street and Kaoth Alley near the River Gate.
Members of the Watermens Guild were responsible for supplying drinking water for Daggerford, travelling a few hundred yards upstream along the Delimbiyr River to collect fresh water. The guild also aided in suppressing fires and ensuring the citys drainage system was functioning properly.
Guildmembers always wore blue caps and used blue carts to haul water.
