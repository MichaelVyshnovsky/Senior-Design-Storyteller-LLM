The '''Emerald Brotherhood''' was an adventuring company in operation around [[1358 DR]].

==Activities==
This group was dedicated to fighting [[mind flayer]]s and [[neogi]] whenever possible. They were generally found patrolling the areas between [[Anadia]] and [[Toril]], though sometimes they were hired for jobs within other [[crystal sphere]]s.

==Base of Operations==
The Emerald Brotherhood conducted its operations aboard the [[vipership]] ''[[Tyr's Strike]]''. Their home port was an isolated planetoid in the [[Tears of Selûne]], where a temple dedicated to the [[Faerûnian pantheon|Faerûnian god]] [[Tyr]] was under construction.

==History==
The Emerald Brotherhood was a Torilian [[adventurer|adventuring]] party that first formed to protect the forest of [[Thornwood]] and its [[druid]]s from an invading tribe of [[gnoll]]s. They went on to become famed as vicious [[lycanthrope]]-hunters in the lands east and south of [[Amn]] and [[Tethyr]].

In [[1359 DR]], they were exploring the [[Snowflake Mountains]] as part of a quest that they had received from a king in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. He had tasked them with hunting down and killing three evil [[dragon]]s that lurked along the [[Deepwash]]. However, while on those mountains, they were accosted by mindflayer slavers and taken into [[Wildspace]] on their ship the ''[[Mind Ripper]]''.

The Emerald Brotherhood eventually managed to defeat their captors, escaping alongside a captive [[arcane (race)|arcane]]. Afterword, they destroyed a major neogi [[slavery]] operation. They then went on to purchase the [[vipership]] ''[[Tyr's Strike]]'' from the same arcane with whom they had escaped.

The Emerald Brotherhood set their sights on destroying both the mind flayers and the neogi. After only fourteen months, neogi and other slavers in [[Realmspace]] came to fear them, with the former putting a bounty of 50,000 [[gold piece]]s on them. The leader of the Emerald Brotherhood used many of the treasures that they had seized from slavers to fund the construction of the temple to Tyr that they used as their base of operations.

==Allegiances==
The group partnered with [[Elestam's Crusaders]], with whom they fought against both dragons and [[vampire]]s in the new kingdom of [[Erlkazar]].

The Brotherhood were also friends with the [[mage]] [[Gamalon Idogyr]], and they would visit him from time to time at his shop on the [[Rock of Bral]].
