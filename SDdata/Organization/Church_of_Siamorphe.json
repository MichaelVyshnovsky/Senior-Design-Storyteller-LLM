See that this happens often and wherever possible.|Excerpt from the credo of Siamorphe's church.}}",
        "Organization": {
            "Titles": "Individual members of the church were known as Scions, a name originating from the fact they all descended from one of the god(dess)'s mortal incarnations. Thus in theory, any member of her clergy could become a vessel for the divine being's next reincarnation.\n\nTitles included (in descending order): High Lord/Lady Scion, Duke/Duchess Scion, Marquis/Marquise Scion, Count/Countess Scion, Viscount/Viscountess Scion, Baron/Baroness Scion, and Lord/Lady Scion."

        "Activities": "Siamorphe's clergy sought to further increase the wealth of nobles that patronized the church. Many of them served as royal advisers, viziers, [[sage]]s, and religious advisors,\n\nOn some occasions, Scions served as personal bodyguards and would even take a ruler's place when their court came under threat or a possible assassination seemed iminent.\n\nSiamorphe's servants instructed Faerûnian nobility on how to best conduct themselves and make wise decisions, for the betterment of their subjects and the Realms overall. They offered loyal support to nobles during times of crisis or self-doubt and obstructed acts that could lead to ruin or revolt. When needed, they routed out corrupt members of royal court and ensured their patron received true and right advisement.",
        "Rituals": "Priests of Siamorphe prayed for their spells at noon, under the warmth and light of the [[the sun|Chalice of Siamorphe]].\n\nRegular priestly services were congregations during which specifics of rule and governance were discussed among local nobility. Many of the faith's older rituals and observances had been lost to time, but were later recovered.",

            "Regions": "Siamorphe's faith could be found across the breadth of [[Faerûn]], including regions like [[the North]], the [[Western Heartlands|Western]] and [[Eastern Heartlands]], [[Calimshan]], and [[Tethyr]] in the [[Lands of Intrigue]],<ref group=\"note\">''[[Ed Greenwood Presents Elminster's Forgotten Realms]]'' states that Calimshan is excluded from the [[Shining Sea]] realms in which the worship of Siamorphe was prevalent. and the realms along the [[Chultan Peninsula]] along the [[Shining Sea]].",
            "Temples": "Shrines and temples to Siamorphe were often built as small [[marble]]–and–[[mahogany]] chapels attached to the grand manor-houses of noble families. They were often extravagantly built, to the extent of being considered distasteful. The crests of noble families were often a prominent piece of any Siamorphan altar.\n\nThe most notable of Siamorphe was the [[Chapel and Chalice of the Divine Right]], built within [[Assumbar Villa]] in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]]\n\nShrines to Siamorphe were found in numerous manors of [[Nobility of Baldur's Gate|Patriar families]] in [[Baldur's Gate]], the kingdom of [[Cormyr]], and Waterdeep."

            "Weapons and Arms": "Adventuring Scions guarded themselves in only the finest [[armor]] available to them, never settling for anything less protective than [[chain mail]]. They preferred weapons that were often associated with rulership or royalty, such as [[mace]]s, [[rod]]s, or [[scepter]]s.",
            "Spells": "Spells associated with or unique to worshipers of Siamorphe included ''[[divine bloodline]]'', ''[[Unquestioning obedience]]'', ''[[loyal vassal]]'', and ''[[divine investiture]]''."

        "Dogma": {
            "Beliefs": "Siamorphe's followers were taught that nobles had the right to rule over others, so long as they did so ably and responsibly. They were obliged to provide the best possible leadership to their subjects, regardless of their personal interests. Church leadership believed that nobles' public personas were far more important than any errors or mistakes they made in private.\n\nThey subscribed to the belief that nobles inherited the better personal qualities along with the material wealth of their ancestors in order to provide best possible rulership. They maintained these strict rulers of financial inheritance in order to prevent squabbling between rival family members."

It was seen as more of a local cult rather than an officially-recognized religion, and diminished as the city's Baldurian nobility devolved over the course of several centuries. That iteration of Siamorphe nearly died from lack of worship.\n\nWhen Siamorphe finally did die, during a riot during the mid–13{{th}} century [[DR]], he appointed a [[nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian noblewoman]] to succeed him as Lady Siamorphe. She garnered great influence in Waterdeep following the city's [[Guild Wars]] and emerged as the patron of its noble class. \n\nFor the next hundred years, worship of Siamorphe was limited to within the City of Splendors. However by the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, her faith had garnered a small following in the southern realm of [[Tethyr]]. \n\nMembers of Siamorphe's church greatly shaped the political landscapes of realms in the decades that followed, well into the 15{{th}} century DR. \n\nSiamorphe's exact status during the time of the [[Second Sundering]] was not entirely clear. She was not counted among the members of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]] as of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, but was still known as a demipower worshiped by the Waterdhavian [[Cassalanter]] family around that same time.",
