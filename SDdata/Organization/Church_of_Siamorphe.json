        "mainbody": "The church of Siamorphe, also known as the church of Divine Right, albeit one of the least numerous.\nWhile small, the church maintained a disciplined order among its members.\nIndividual members of the church were known as Scions, a name originating from the fact they all descended from one of the god(dess)s mortal incarnations. Thus in theory, any member of her clergy could become a vessel for the divine beings next reincarnation.\nTitles included (in descending order) High Lord/Lady Scion, Duke/Duchess Scion, Marquis/Marquise Scion, Count/Countess Scion, Viscount/Viscountess Scion, Baron/Baroness Scion, and Lord/Lady Scion.\nSiamorphes clergy sought to further increase the wealth of nobles that patronized the church. Many of them served as royal advisers, viziers, sages, and religious advisors,\nOn some occasions, Scions served as personal bodyguards and would even take a rulers place when their court came under threat or a possible assassination seemed iminent.\nSiamorphes servants instructed Faerûnian nobility on how to best conduct themselves and make wise decisions, for the betterment of their subjects and the Realms overall. They offered loyal support to nobles during times of crisis or self-doubt and obstructed acts that could lead to ruin or revolt. When needed, they routed out corrupt members of royal court and ensured their patron received true and right advisement. \nPriests of Siamorphe prayed for their spells at noon, under the warmth and light of the Chalice of Siamorphe.\nRegular priestly services were congregations during which specifics of rule and governance were discussed among local nobility. Many of the faiths older rituals and observances had been lost to time, but were later recovered.\nPriests of Siamorphe presided over the induction of noble-born babes into the faith. These specific rites cost upwards of 10,000 gp, to which many nobles were more than happy to pay. \nThe Divine Pageantry was a celebration held during summer months in the city of Waterdeep and involved nobles dressing in anachronistic costumes and distributing copper and silver coins to the citys commoners.\nThe Canticle of the Silver Chalice was a hymn that honored the goddess of nobility.\nSiamorphes faith could be found across the breadth of Faerûn, including regions like the North, the Western and Eastern Heartlands, Calimshan, and Tethyr in the Lands of Intrigue,Ed Greenwood Presents Elminsters Forgotten Realms states that Calimshan is excluded from the Shining Sea realms in which the worship of Siamorphe was prevalent. and the realms along the Chultan Peninsula along the Shining Sea.\nShrines and temples to Siamorphe were often built as small marble–and–mahogany chapels attached to the grand manor-houses of noble families. They were often extravagantly built, to the extent of being considered distasteful. The crests of noble families were often a prominent piece of any Siamorphan altar.\nThe most notable of Siamorphe was the Chapel and Chalice of the Divine Right, built within Assumbar Villa in the Sea Ward\nShrines to Siamorphe were found in numerous manors of Patriar families in Baldurs Gate, the kingdom of Cormyr, and Waterdeep.\nThe holy symbol of Siamorphe was a silver chalice emblazoned with a golden sun, referred to as the Golden Cup or cup of bounty.\nPriests of Siamorphe wore filigreed silk robes of deep purple. At all times they either wore a silver circlet adorned with Siamorphes holy symbol or carried with them a silver goblet, often filled with holy water.\nAdventuring Scions guarded themselves in only the finest armor available to them, never settling for anything less protective than chain mail. They preferred weapons that were often associated with rulership or royalty, such as maces, rods, or scepters.\nSpells associated with or unique to worshipers of Siamorphe included divine bloodline, Unquestioning obedience, loyal vassal, and divine investiture.\nMembers of the church believed their collective actions helped provide the most stable and just forms of government across the Realms.\nSiamorphes followers were taught that nobles had the right to rule over others, so long as they did so ably and responsibly. They were obliged to provide the best possible leadership to their subjects, regardless of their personal interests. Church leadership believed that nobles public personas were far more important than any errors or mistakes they made in private.\nThey subscribed to the belief that nobles inherited the better personal qualities along with the material wealth of their ancestors in order to provide best possible rulership. They maintained these strict rulers of financial inheritance in order to prevent squabbling between rival family members.\nThe Order of the Silver Chalice was a group of Tethyrian noble warriors that fought in support of the throne during the mid–14 century DR.\nThe church of Siamorphe primarily comprised clerics and specialty priests, known as Highborns, but also included wizards, paladins, and fighters. Some of Siamorphes clerics took on additional responsibilities as loremasters.\nWorship of Siamorphe was prominent in Baldurs Gate during the citys early history, before hisSiamorphe manifested as both a masculine and feminine gender throughout the history of the Realms. Either pronoun is used depending on usage in the source material. temple was razed during an uprising. It was seen as more of a local cult rather than an officially-recognized religion, and diminished as the citys Baldurian nobility devolved over the course of several centuries. That iteration of Siamorphe nearly died from lack of worship.\nWhen Siamorphe finally did die, during a riot during the mid–13 century DR, he appointed a Waterdhavian noblewoman to succeed him as Lady Siamorphe. She garnered great influence in Waterdeep following the citys Guild Wars and emerged as the patron of its noble class. \nFor the next hundred years, worship of Siamorphe was limited to within the City of Splendors. However by the , her faith had garnered a small following in the southern realm of Tethyr. \nMembers of Siamorphes church greatly shaped the political landscapes of realms in the decades that followed, well into the 15 century DR. \nSiamorphes exact status during the time of the Second Sundering was not entirely clear. She was not counted among the members of the Faerûnian pantheon as of the , but was still known as a demipower worshiped by the Waterdhavian Cassalanter family around that same time.\nClergy of Siamorphes church were often nobles and royal courtiers themselves.\n* Marquise Scion Aalangama Gulderhorn, a member of the Order of the Silver Chalice in Waterdeep and Countess of Morninggold.\n* Arietta Seasilver, Siamorphes chosen during the era of the Second Sundering.\n* Darlynd Immur, the former High Vizier of Tashluta and adviser to the noble Rowanmantle family of Tilverton in Cormyr.\n* Ilmurra Tarlhawk, a thespian and escort that worked in Palace of Waterdeep.\n* Zaranda Star, the queen of Tethyr that converted to the faith following her ascension as monarch."
