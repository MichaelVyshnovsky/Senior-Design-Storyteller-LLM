        "mainbody": "The '''Nine Swords Company''' was an [[adventuring company]] that operated in the early days of [[the Vast]], in the 6th century [[DR]], and was reformed in the 1370s DR. It consisted entirely of practitioners of the [[Sublime Way]].",
        "History": "The company was formed by [[Thallastam]] of [[Procampur]], after he returned from study in [[Kara-Tur]]. They adventured through the Vast, performing good deeds and slaying dangerous monsters.\n\nWhen they eventually disbanded, Thallastam concealed his companions' nine swords in [[Swords Pool (pool)|Swords Pool]] using a spell he'd cast,{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Crusaders, Swordsages, Warblades|}} to protect and preserve them. His spell at Swords Pool outlived him and his companions, and still preserved their nine swords by [[1370 DR]].\n\nIn the mid-1370s DR, several young [[blade magic]]ians of the Vast re-founded the Nine Swords Company, using the [[Inn of the Nine Swords]] at [[Swords Pool (village)|Swords Pool]].",
        "Organization": "The first Nine Swords Company consisted of ten blade magicians: four [[crusader]]s; five [[warblade (blade magic)|warblades]]; and Thallastam himself, a [[swordsage]]. The nine each wielded a magic [[sword]], while Thallastam preferred to fight unarmed."
