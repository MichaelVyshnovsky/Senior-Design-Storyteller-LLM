The '''Moneylenders' Coalition''' was a group of individuals that operated in [[Daggerford]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They increased their wealth by lending money to others on the conditional of repayment.

==Activities==
The coalition offered loans to entrepreneurs and prospective business-owners, along with those people interested in undertaking a life of adventure. They charged 10% interest on business loans and 20% on adventuring loans.

To ensure they received payment, they put borrowers under the effect of a ''[[Geas/Quest|geas]]'' spell or placed upon their finger a ''[[curse]]d'' [[ring]] that ensure they would return to their headquarters once every three [[tenday]]s. These effects were negated when the loan was paid off in full.

==Base of Operations==
Their headquarters was located in the town's [[River Quarter]].
