        "mainbody": "The '''Chieftains in Gold''' were a notorious nation of [[bandit]] lords active in the [[Nether Mountains]] long before the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "The Chieftains' nation was ruled by hereditary kings They dominated of the lands around the western Nether Mountains and preyed on trade between [[Sundabar]] and the population center that would become [[Silverymoon]], gaining great wealth from these illicit activities. When relations between the bandits and the leaders of trading lands were good, the Chieftains merely extracted exorbitant tolls from merchants. When relations were poor, they would rob the caravans outright.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Chieftains in Gold rode out from a large keep in the Nether Mountains north of [[Silverymoon Pass]], where they also stored their stolen treasures.\n\nWhenever one of their number died, they was buried amid the [[Tombs of Deckon Thar]], along with a collection of riches and stolen loot. They were famed for the grandeur of the burials of their kings.",
        "History": "The Chieftains in Gold were founded sometime before the formal founding of Silverymoon in the power vacuum created in the wake of the collapse of centralized power in the region.The Chieftains in Gold were stated to have been founded immediately following the break-up of \"the Lost Kingdom\", however it is unclear to which kingdom this refers. The most likely candidates are [[Delzoun]] (c. [[-100 DR]]), [[Phalorm]] (c. [[615 DR]]), or [[Delimbiyran]] (c. [[697 DR]]). They had their own culture, and came to control the western Nether Mountains as they raided caravans and warred with the [[dwarves]].\n\nThey were active for eight generations, with the rulers of the first seven being interred in the secret Tombs of Deckon Thar. However, during the eighth generation, they were wiped out by a horde of [[orc]]s, who also emptied the bandits' mighty keep. [[Ballad]]s would claim that every member of the Chieftains in Gold&mdash;including the women and children&mdash;died in the battle with the orcs. The tombs of their kings, however, remained unplundered.\n\nBy the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century DR, there were reports that the members of the bandits interred at the Tombs of Deckon Thar had risen as [[undead]] [[wight]]s ruled by a powerful [[great wight]] called [[Vinjarak]] the Mound King. He ruled these undead for at least 100 years afterward, during which time he became a menace to nearby [[Luruar]].",
        "Members": "The only member of the Chieftains whose name was remembered to history was [[Deckon Thar]], the first of the bandit kings and the first to be buried in the barrows (and thus the namesake of those treasure-filled tombs). Other bandit kings were remembered predominantly for the dangerous weapons which they wielded: one particularly warlike king had a ''[[cursed berserking sword|cursed berserking]] [[longsword]]'' while another wielded the [[Sentient item|sentient]] [[broadsword]] ''[[Deepchill]]'', which he had claimed from a [[dwarf|dwarven]] king whom he slew in battle."
