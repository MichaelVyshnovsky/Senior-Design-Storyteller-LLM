        "mainbody": "The Feathergale Knights, or Feathergale Society, was a sub-branch of the Cult of the Howling Hatred during the Elemental Evil crisis.\nThe Feathergale Knights usually acted as elite forces of the Howling Hatred cult or they surveyed the land around Feathergale Spire, guarding the entrance to the air cults hidden temple.\nThe Feathergale Knights believed themselves above the Howling Hatred cultists, whom they considered lunatic perverts. They believed they had made tremendous sacrifices in order to make their country strong. In truth, however, they were deeply corrupted by Yan-C-Bins influence and each of them had committed so many crimes that theyd earned the dislike of all those they believed they protected.\nThe Feathergale Knights were founded in Waterdeep by Thurl Merosska, who gathered around himself people of similar minds from among the wealthy of Waterdeep. Thurl selected his knights one by one.\nWith reluctance, they pledged their loyalty to Aerisi Kalinoth.\nIn 1491 DR, they established themselves at the Feathergale Spire in the Dessarin Valley waiting for the right time to summon Yan-C-Bin to Toril. However, in the Spire, some adventurers defeated them."
