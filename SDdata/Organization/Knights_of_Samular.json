        "mainbody": "The '''Knights of Samular''', also known as the '''Holy Order of the Knights of Samular''', were an order of [[paladins]] in the service of [[Tyr]], beginning in the 10{{th}} century [[DR]], who focused on the supremacy of law. Formerly based at [[Thornhold]], their main base of operations was [[Summit Hall]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]], which was supplemented by the [[Halls of Justice]] in [[Waterdeep]].",
        "Membership": "Admittance into the order was open to all [[human|men]] of the Realms, provided they completed a quest and undertook an oath to serve the ''Maimed God''.",
        "History": "Formed in [[952 DR]] after the [[Troll Wars|Second Troll War]], the Knights of Samular traced their roots to three brothers who became champions of the war, [[Samular Caradoon]], [[Renwick Caradoon]], and [[Amphail the Just]]. While successfully stopping the siege of [[troll]]s through the use of the [[Rings of Samular]] and the magical siege engine known as the ''[[Kezefbane]]'', Amphail and Renwick were killed around the end of the war (though the latter would become an [[archlich]] entombed at the [[Sumber Hills]]). The invading trolls were eventually routed by Samular and his growing group of Tyrran paladins. These knights would eventually come to be known as the Knights of Samular.\n\nAfter routing the warlord [[Brunyundar Margaster]] from the keep, the knights made Thornhold as their chapterhouse. \n\nThe Knights later lost their headquarters to the [[Zhentarim]] thanks to the treachery of [[Dag Zoreth]]. The keep was then confiscated by [[Bronwyn Caradoon]], who took up residence with her niece, but she did not have good relations with the Knights.<ref>\n\nAfter their loss of the keep, the Knights of Samular relocated to Summit Hall and kept a force within the [[Halls of Justice]] in the city of Waterdeep.",
