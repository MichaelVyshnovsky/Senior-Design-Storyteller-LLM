The League began to decline in the mid–14th century DR because of many other local costers being formed. Under the leadership of Dabron Sashenstar and with the backing of the Dukes of Baldurs Gate, the Merchants League grew into a priakos and began to challenge the Iron Throne for the weapons trade in the Western Heartlands in 1374 DR.\nPrior to 1482 DR, the Merchants League was dissolved by the Council of Four, it continues to operate through its member families, which control the Woodworkers, Seafarers, and Traders guilds.Ed Greenwood, Matt Sernett, Steve Winter (August 20, 2013). “Campaign Guide”.
