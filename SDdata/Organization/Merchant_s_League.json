        "mainbody": "The '''Merchant's League''' was an organization based in [[Baldur's Gate]] that promoted safety on the caravan routes throughout the region surrounding the city. The League began to decline in the mid–14th century [[DR]] because of many other local costers being formed. Under the leadership of [[Dabron Sashenstar]] and with the backing of the [[Council of Four|Dukes of Baldur's Gate]], the Merchant's League grew into a [[priakos]] and began to challenge the [[Iron Throne]] for the weapons trade in the [[Western Heartlands]] in [[1374 DR]].\n\nPrior to [[1482 DR]], the Merchant's League was dissolved by the [[Council of Four]], it continues to operate through its member families, which control the Woodworkers, Seafarers, and Traders guilds.<ref>Ed Greenwood, Matt Sernett, Steve Winter (August 20, 2013). “Campaign Guide”.
