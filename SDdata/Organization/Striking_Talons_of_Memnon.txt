The '''Striking Talons of Memnon''' was an adventuring band from [[Calimshan]], active in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
By the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the Striking Talons of Memnon were believed to had been dead for a decade, perished in the [[Weldath]] forest of [[Tethyr]]. The band's name, however, was remembered thanks to stories of the accumulated treasures buried nearby the [[Hunter's Tree]]. Along with another group â€“ [[Fallowgar's Furies]]'s treasures, it was believed that the Striking Talons buried some [[elf|elven]] magic items, [[coin]]s, and [[gem]]s the adventurers collected as they adventured in the [[Forest of Tethir]].
