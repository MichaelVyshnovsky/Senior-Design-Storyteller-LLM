The '''Most Transcendent Affiliation of Paradisiacal Pens''' was an association of bonded scribes devoted to [[Amaunator]], the Keeper of the Eternal Sun.

==Activities==
Members of this group were usually quite aloof and cocky. They traveled [[Faerûn]] preaching the holy word of law and order. Their goal was to construct many large stone amphitheaters dedicated to preserving the law in the form of [[book]]s and [[scroll]]s from every land they visited.
