House Miritar was an elven clan on the island of Evermeet. Since the 9th century DR, they looked after the northern fishing town of Elion and its surrounding area. Around 1374 DR, the house occupied by the clan was called Seamist.
Originally from Cormanthor, the Miritars fled Myth Drannor when the city fell.
