The '''Brain Brokerage''' was located on the edge of the southwestern-most section of the [[Ring Caverns (Oryndoll)|Ring Caverns]] of [[Oryndoll]]. The [[mind flayer]] merchants of the consortium often specialized in acquiring rare brains from willing merchants of other races.

==Activites==
It was common for the brain brokerage to organize caravans to other Underdark cities with the purpose of getting access to rare brains. Caravans traveled to [[Guallidurth]], [[Ooltul]], [[Sloopdilmonpolop]], [[Sshamath]], and [[Zokir]].
