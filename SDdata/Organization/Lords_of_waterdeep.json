        "mainbody": "Piergeiron\nThe Lords of Waterdeep were the mysterious and predominantly anonymous ruling council of Waterdeep, having governed the city from the 11 century onwards.\nA full council comprised 20 Lords, though this number might vary from 16 to 29. The full number of Lords was not always known and some Lords were kept secret \nthumb|right|300px|Open Lord Piergeiron and a Masked Lord in official garments circa 1372 DR.\nThe Open Lord of Waterdeep (also called the \"Unmasked Lord\") was the sole member of the Lords of Waterdeep whose identity was publicly known. The Open Lord was also the citys chief diplomat.\nThere were seven Open Lords of Waterdeep to 1489 DR Ahghairon the Mage, Baeron Silmaeril, Lhestyn the Masked Lady, Piergeiron the Paladinson, Caladorn Cassalanter, Dagult Neverember, and Lady Laeral Silverhand.\nThe Lords of Waterdeep were only seen in public when sitting in the Lords Court or when appearing every four years at Shieldmeet Council when the Lords Rule is reaffirmed. The identities of the Lords, other than the Open Lord, were not supposed to be known to the public, although they were known to each other. The intent of this was to ensure that the Lords were free of coercion and could be drawn from any social strata within the city. While the masked Lords were considered to be equal to the Open Lord in authority, some executive authority was reserved for the Open Lord, including the vetting and selection of new Lords, the naming of the next Open Lord, and determining the needed number of Lords.\nUltimate legal authority in Waterdeep fell to the Open and masked Lords of Waterdeep. The Open Lord and at least two others attended the Lords Court while it was in session, enforcing the city-states set of rules and laws known as the Code Legal. The lords listened to the most severe crimes committed against the city and the Waterdhavian people. They also appeared on occasion when asked to by Waterdhavian lower courts, but always only few in number. It was extremely rare for more than seven Lords to sit in Court on a particular occasion, except at Sheildmeet.\nThe Lords helped maintain peace and order within the city and beyond,The Lords of Waterdeep cannot be held responsible for the flogging, banishment, incarceration, or execution of adventurers who violate the Code Legal, nor are the Lords responsible for the actions of beholder crime lords, unscrupulous nobles, drow swashbucklers, and evil clones. by directing the four branches of the Waterdhavian armed forces, namely the City Guard, the City Watch, the Griffon Cavalry, and the citys naval forces. They also held direct command over the actions of Force Grey, \nThe Lords also held some power over Waterdeeps economic status, controlling the minting of coinage and trade bars. They also possessed sole authority to grant nobility to Waterdhavians of great wealth and influence that petitioned as such. \nThey also controlled diplomatic relations. The Lords had final say in whether to approve the erection of proposed embassies of foreign agents and governments being built within city limits. The Open Lord also represented Waterdeep in the Council of Lords.  \nEvery Shieldmeet, at the Shieldmeet Council, the Lords Rule was reaffirmed.\nWhile no other Lords were formally named, some individuals became the subject of widespread rumors that could even become a general consensus. The penalty for impersonating a Lord, whether by dressing in a set of their identical clothing or by a false claim, was punishable by the impostors immediate execution.\nAt any time, the Open Lord could demand the private unmasking of any person posing as a masked Lord, under punishment of death for refusal.\nWhile the Lords only officially gathered within the Lords Court, the Open Lord made full use of the Palace of Waterdeep in full view of the citys populace.\nthumb|right|300px|The Masked Lords each appeared identical to one another, thanks to their magical raiments.\nAll Masked Lords wore black formless robes and spoke through the Open Lord, in order to keep their identities secret. These magical items—known as the Lords ensemble or \"Lords Effects\"—included illusion-enhanced robes, a heavily enchanted helm, the numerous magical Lords Rings, and the Lords Amulet.\nSome powerful spellcasters were capable of piercing through the illusion magic that maintained the Masked Lords identities.\nThe Lords maintained numerous contacts throughout Waterdeep, even in the less-reputable places, such as the underground city of Skullport. These individuals often aided agents working on behalf of the Lords, or acted as their eyes and ears within the city streets.\nInterestingly enough, Waterdeeps system of rule was so iconic throughout the Sword Coast, that it was more or less mimicked by other governing bodies, such as the Council of Guilds in Daggerford.\nThe first Open Lord Ahghairon ascended his role in the , marked by the beginning of the Northreckoning calendar.\nThe Waterdhavian nobility was first recognized by Ahghairon and the Lords in the . This decree proved extremely successful for the Lords and their relationship with the growing number of wealthy merchants in the city and surrounding farmlands. In the years that followed, the two power groups were often at odds with one another, but ultimately the Lords prevented the guilds from gaining too much influence.\nThe Lords regained governance over the city in the , and over the course of three years added an additional 14 members to their ranks. Baeron Silmaeril ascended as the Open Lord and the Zoar and Gildeggh noble families were exiled from the city.\nYears of peace in Waterdeep ended in the , when two masked Lords were slain by Amril Zoar, favored son of the outcast Zoar family. \nThe Lords of Waterdeep collectively exiled the Shadow Thieves from the city in the , and took action to limit the power of any criminal organization within the city in the decades that followed. The troublesome thieves guild subsequently relocated to Amn in the south.\nAfter the Netherese enclave of Thultanthar returned to Faerûn in the , the Lords of Waterdeep began negotiations with Prince Aglarel Tanthul. The negotiations went poorly and the burgeoning alliance that was to be formed between the two cities was immediately halted.\nIn the , the Lords issued the Tarnsmoke Proclamation effectively legalizing bounty hunting within the city and surrounding lands.\nWhen the Cult of the Dragon reemerged as a threat to the Realms in the 1480s DR, the City of Splendors hosted four sessions of the Council of Waterdeep in response. During the meetings, the Lords were represented first by Open Lord Dagult Neverember, then by his successor Laeral Silverhand.\nThroughout the councils history, the exact number of masked Lords was never known, but scholars estimated that there had been between 50 and 80 Lords as of The Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, four of whom had also served as Open Lord. The Lords came from all walks of life and while they were predominantly human, they had had members of various races from throughout the Realms. \nOn occasion some individuals garnered suspicion that they were one of Waterdeeps Masked Lords, while in fact they were not.
