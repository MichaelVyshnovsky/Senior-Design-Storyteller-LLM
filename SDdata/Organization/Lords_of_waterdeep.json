The Open Lord was also the city's chief diplomat.\n\nThere were seven [[Lords of Waterdeep#Open Lord|Open Lords]] of [[Waterdeep]] to [[1489 DR]]; [[Ahghairon]] the Mage, [[Baeron Silmaeril]], [[Lhestyn]] the Masked Lady, [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]], [[Caladorn Cassalanter]], [[Dagult Neverember]], and [[Laeral Silverhand|Lady Laeral Silverhand]].<ref name=\"SCAG-p55\" >",
            "Masked Lords": "The Lords of Waterdeep were only seen in public when sitting in the Lord's Court or when appearing every four years at [[Shieldmeet]] Council when the Lord's Rule is reaffirmed. The identities of the Lords, other than the Open Lord, were not supposed to be known to the public, although they were known to each other. The intent of this was to ensure that the Lords were free of coercion and could be drawn from any social strata within the city. While the masked Lords were considered to be equal to the Open Lord in authority, some executive authority was reserved for the Open Lord, including the vetting and selection of new Lords, the naming of the next Open Lord,<ref> and determining the needed number of Lords."

            "Lords' Rule": "Every [[Shieldmeet]], at the Shieldmeet Council, the Lords' Rule was reaffirmed.",
            "Anonymity": "While no other Lords were formally named, some individuals became the subject of widespread rumors that could even become a general consensus. The penalty for impersonating a Lord, whether by dressing in a set of their identical clothing or by a false claim, was punishable by the impostor's immediate execution.\n\nAt any time, the Open Lord could demand the private unmasking of any person posing as a masked Lord, under punishment of death for refusal."

        "Base of Operations": "While the Lords only officially gathered within the Lord's Court, the Open Lord made full use of the [[Palace of Waterdeep]] in full view of the city's populace.",
        "Possessions": "[[File:Lord's ensemble-5e.png|thumb|right|300px|The Masked Lords each appeared identical to one another, thanks to their magical raiments.]]\nAll Masked Lords wore black formless robes and spoke through the Open Lord, in order to keep their identities secret. These magical items—known as the [[Lord's ensemble]] or \"Lords Effects\"—included [[illusion]]-enhanced robes, a heavily [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] helm, the numerous magical Lord's Rings, and the Lord's Amulet.\n\nSome powerful spellcasters were capable of piercing through the illusion magic that maintained the Masked Lords' identities.",
        "Relationships": "The Lords maintained numerous contacts throughout Waterdeep, even in the less-reputable places, such as the underground city of [[Skullport]]. These individuals often aided agents working on behalf of the Lords, or acted as their eyes and ears within the city streets.\n\nInterestingly enough, Waterdeep's system of rule was so iconic throughout the [[Sword Coast]], that it was more or less mimicked by other governing bodies, such as the [[Council of Guilds]] in [[Daggerford]].",
        "History": "The first Open Lord Ahghairon ascended his role in the {{YearlinkName|1032}}, marked by the beginning of the [[Northreckoning]] calendar.\n\nThe [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian nobility]] was first recognized by Ahghairon and the Lords in the {{YearlinkName|1248}}. This decree proved extremely successful for the Lords and their relationship with the growing number of wealthy merchants in the city and surrounding farmlands. In the years that followed, the two power groups were often at odds with one another, but ultimately the Lords prevented the guilds from gaining too much influence.\n\nThe Lords regained governance over the city in the {{YearlinkName|1273}}, and over the course of three years added an additional 14 members to their ranks. [[Baeron Silmaeril]] ascended as the Open Lord and the [[Zoar]] and [[Gildeggh]] noble families were exiled from the city.\n\nYears of peace in Waterdeep ended in the {{YearlinkName|1355}}, when two masked Lords were slain by [[Amril Zoar]], favored son of the outcast Zoar family. \n\nThe Lords of Waterdeep collectively exiled the [[Shadow Thieves]] from the city in the {{YearlinkName|1300}}, and took action to limit the power of any criminal organization within the city in the decades that followed. The troublesome thieves' guild subsequently relocated to [[Amn]] in the south.\n\nAfter the [[Netherese enclave]] of [[Thultanthar]] returned to [[Faerûn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, the Lords of Waterdeep began negotiations with [[Princes of Shade|Prince]] [[Aglarel Tanthul]]. The negotiations went poorly and the burgeoning alliance that was to be formed between the two cities was immediately halted.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1400}}, the Lords issued the 'Tarnsmoke Proclamation' effectively legalizing [[bounty hunter|bounty hunting]] within the city and surrounding lands.\n\nWhen the [[Cult of the Dragon]] reemerged as a threat to the Realms in the 1480s [[DR]], the City of Splendors hosted four sessions of the [[Council of Waterdeep]] in response. During the meetings, the Lords were represented first by Open Lord [[Dagult Neverember]], then by his successor [[Laeral Silverhand]].",
