The family had a villa in the Sea Ward, on the southwest corner of Delzorin Street and Diamond Street.
The Cassalanter family had an ancient burial crypt in the Dungeon Level of Undermountain with several of the family ancestors interred there. A Shrine of Myrkul was the part of the family crypt.
House Cassalanter was ennobled in the  when the Lords of Waterdeep recognized several merchant houses and granted them noble titles and seals.
In 1368 DR, Cassalanters loaned two ten-million golden lions with a huge interest rate. The first loan was to Widow Silvermane who ran a lottery in the North Ward of Waterdeep, and the second one went to the Field of Triumph Race Track in the Sea Ward. The astronomical loans were caused by goddess Tymoras luck going out of control all over the Realms. Every single gambler picked the winning number and winning horses, costing Widow Silvermane and the Field of Triumph disastrous losses.
In 1370 DR, a skeleton dressed in Cassalanter family garb was seen attacking several Waterdhavians. These incidents attracted the attention of the citys Lords of Waterdeep. The undead came from the familys old crypt in Undermountain, and a lone hero was sent to investigate the restless Cassalanter ancestors. The hero successfully destroyed the undead and the ghoul necromancer behind the infestation, Ghoulmaster and the noble family offered a hefty reward for the deed.
In the late 15 century DR, the Cassalanters faced imminent bankruptcy. In order to prevent it, in  Ammalia and Victoro struck a deal with the archdevil Asmodeus, trading the souls of their children in exchange for instant financial comeback. Their eldest son, Osvaldo, was taken immediately and transformed into a chain devil, while the younger twins Elzerina and Terenzio were scheduled to be taken on the occasion of their 9 birthday, one tenday after Founders Day of .
Sometime before 1492 DR, one of the Ladies of House Cassalanter caused quite a stir by wearing a gown colored with a certain variety of loud maroon dye to one of her grand parties that took place in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep.
