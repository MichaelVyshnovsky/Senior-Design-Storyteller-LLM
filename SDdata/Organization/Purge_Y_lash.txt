The Purge Yûlash faction was a group of citizens in Yûlash around 1367 DR who favored the rule of Zhentil Keep over that of rival Hillsfar in their city.
At 130 members, the faction was considerably less numerous in their supporters compared to their rival, perhaps because the Red Plumes of Hillsfar occupied the city in 1367 DR.
The faction sought vengeance in the form of political assassinations, sabotage, espionage, and open resistance against the soldiers of Hillsfar.
