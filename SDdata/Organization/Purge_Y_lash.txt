The '''Purge Yûlash''' faction was a group of citizens in [[Yûlash]] around [[1367 DR]] who favored the rule of [[Zhentil Keep]] over that of rival [[Hillsfar]] in their city.

==Members==
At 130 members, the faction was considerably less numerous in their supporters compared to their rival, perhaps because the [[Red Plumes]] of Hillsfar occupied the city in 1367 DR.

==Activities==
The faction sought vengeance in the form of political assassinations, sabotage, espionage, and open resistance against the soldiers of Hillsfar.
