The Society of the Verdant Arrow was an anti-human organization that met at Mytela Halvasyns house around 1368 DR.
The Society advocated for the banishment of humans from Aglarond, thereby returning it to the way things were during the days of the Yuir elves. The members were particularly frustrated by the often-absent human ruler of Aglarond, the Simbul, and strongly opposed the Sons of Hoar.
The organization was led by Guthrae in 1368 DR, and later Caytran Halvasyn in 1374 DR.
The organization was made up of the half-elf descendants of Lady Mytela Halvasyn, namely those with significant wealth.
