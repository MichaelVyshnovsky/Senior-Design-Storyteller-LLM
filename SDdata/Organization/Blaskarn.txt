The '''Blaskarn''' House was wealthy and powerful in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. They were one of the twenty families that made up the [[Onsruur]]&mdash;the council of lords that governed the Iron City.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|86}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 65: Khôltar, Part 16, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 3}}

==Organization==
Blaskarns were typically large and sturdy, with great physical strength. They were unrefined, aggressive, and warlike, and would have made good soldiers except that their wealth allowed them to indulge their every hedonistic whim. They had a slightly inflated opinion of their standing among the Onsruur families.

==Activities==
They were largely invested in local building companies, but they also owned one or more costers and had a piece of the slave trade.
