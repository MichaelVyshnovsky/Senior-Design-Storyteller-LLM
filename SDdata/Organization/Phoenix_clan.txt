The Phoenix clan was a ninja clan and an ally of the Goshukara clan in Nakamaru in Wa around 1357 DR.
Despite not being as efficient as the Hijo clan, the Phoenix were more obscure and secretive, not telling anyone the true name of their clan or the location of their headquarters. Their leader was a mysterious woman called the Serpent all other members of the clan had met her at least once but could not identify her.
Circa 1257 DR, the Phoenix decided to ally with the Goshukara to prosper, but their mutual ties were not strong. Their recruitment policy was usually to have an older member sponsor a promising young person, who then disappeared from public life and was trained under a new "father" until, after the so-called fathers death, the initiate inherited his position.
