The '''Phoenix clan''' was a [[ninja]] clan and an ally of the [[Goshukara clan]] in [[Nakamaru]] in [[Wa]] around [[1357 DR]].

Despite not being as efficient as the [[Hijo clan]], the Phoenix were more obscure and secretive, not telling anyone the true name of their clan or the location of their headquarters. Their leader was a mysterious woman called [[the Serpent]]; all other members of the clan had met her at least once but could not identify her.

''Circa'' [[1257 DR]], the Phoenix decided to ally with the Goshukara to prosper, but their mutual ties were not strong. Their recruitment policy was usually to have an older member sponsor a promising young person, who then disappeared from public life and was trained under a new "father" until, after the so-called father's death, the initiate inherited his position.
