The Bloodshields Band was an adventuring party of the late 15 century DR.
The band was made up of veteran adventurers. Their leader was Gaerond of the Scars.
They were hired by a wealthy Sembian to find the wizard Elminster Aumar in the  they made it to Shadowdale by early spring. At the Old Skull Inn, they took on the young Thal as a guide, who offered to lead them to where Elminster Aumar was said to reside. He led them instead to an ambush by doppelgangers, being one himself, and the whole band died.
