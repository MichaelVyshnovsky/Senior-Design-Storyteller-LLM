The '''Bloodshields Band''' was an adventuring party of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The band was made up of veteran adventurers. Their leader was [[Gaerond]] of the Scars.

==History==
They were hired by a wealthy [[Sembian]] to find the [[wizard]] [[Elminster Aumar]] in the {{yearlinkName|1479}}; they made it to [[Shadowdale]] by early spring. At the [[Old Skull Inn]], they took on the young [[Thal]] as a guide, who offered to lead them to where Elminster Aumar was said to reside. He led them instead to an ambush by [[doppelganger]]s, being one himself, and the whole band died.
