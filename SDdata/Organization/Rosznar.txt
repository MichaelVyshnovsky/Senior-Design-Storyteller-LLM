The '''Rosznar''' family ({{Pronounce|ROZZ|nar|refs=}}, {{Pronounce|RAWJ|nar|alt=yes|refs=}}) was a rather infamous noble house of [[Waterdeep]] and [[Amn]].

==Activities==
The Rosznars were wealthy landowners, known in part for their vineyards in the countryside of Amn. they also produced a variety of [[poison]]s.

==Tactics==
The Rosznars were not above tossing a political rival, enemy, or other "problem" into [[Lhestyn's Court]] and keeping them there until dead.{{Cite web/Realms by Night/Part Four: Lhestyn's Court}}

==Base of Operations==
The family's [[Rosznar Villa|noble estate]] was located in Waterdeep's [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]] on the north side of [[Thunderstaff Way]] between [[Shield Street]] and [[Copper Street]].

==History==
The Amnian Rosznars were ennobled in the 5{{th}} century [[DR]], in the {{YearlinkName|479}}.

Those members of the family from Waterdeep earned their [[Nobility of Waterdeep|nobility]] much later, in the {{YearlinkName|1252}}.

The Amnian branch of the family had a long-standing feud with the [[steel dragon]] [[Jalanvaloss]].

When [[Estrip Rosznar|Lady Estrip Rosznar]] of Waterdeep died around the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the [[Lords of Waterdeep|City's Lords]] were obligated to acknowledge the familial assertions of her Amnian relatives.{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|8}}

In the 14{{th}} century DR, the Waterdhavian Rosznars were banished from the city after being convicted of slavery. They returned to Waterdeep just over a century later.

However they were unable to regain the respect they'd lost in the scandal that got them banished in the first place. Many members were resentful of the loss, rationalizing that all families had skeletons in their closets and they were just unlucky that a family squabble had let their secret go public. They argued that the slave trade in [[Amn]] remained in good standing, as well as in other locations.
