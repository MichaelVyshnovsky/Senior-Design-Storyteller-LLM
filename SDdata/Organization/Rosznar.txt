The Rosznar family (, ) was a rather infamous noble house of Waterdeep and Amn.
The Rosznars were wealthy landowners, known in part for their vineyards in the countryside of Amn. they also produced a variety of poisons.
The Rosznars were not above tossing a political rival, enemy, or other "problem" into Lhestyns Court and keeping them there until dead.
The familys noble estate was located in Waterdeeps Sea Ward on the north side of Thunderstaff Way between Shield Street and Copper Street.
The Amnian Rosznars were ennobled in the 5 century DR, in the .
Those members of the family from Waterdeep earned their nobility much later, in the .
The Amnian branch of the family had a long-standing feud with the steel dragon Jalanvaloss.
When Lady Estrip Rosznar of Waterdeep died around the , the Citys Lords were obligated to acknowledge the familial assertions of her Amnian relatives.
In the 14 century DR, the Waterdhavian Rosznars were banished from the city after being convicted of slavery. They returned to Waterdeep just over a century later.
However they were unable to regain the respect theyd lost in the scandal that got them banished in the first place. Many members were resentful of the loss, rationalizing that all families had skeletons in their closets and they were just unlucky that a family squabble had let their secret go public. They argued that the slave trade in Amn remained in good standing, as well as in other locations.
