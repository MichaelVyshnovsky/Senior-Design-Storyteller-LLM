The Sailors of the Heavenly Seas was a sect of followers of Valkur, the Captain of the Waves.
Originally from Faer√ªn, the Saiors of the Heavenly Seas decided to depart Toril in favor of exploring the endlessness of Realmspace aboard spelljammer ships. They viewed Valkur as more of a god of exploration versus a god of the oceans.
