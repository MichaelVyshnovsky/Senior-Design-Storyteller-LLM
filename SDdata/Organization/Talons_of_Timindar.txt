The Talons of Timindar were an adventuring company associated with Timindar in Chondath in the early 13 century DR.
In the , the Talons of Timindar explored the overgrown ruins of the city of Ilimar, and encountered nagas, lamia, and giant spiders. Then they unexpectedly discovered Yornars Trail Companion, a lost holy Mielikkian spellbook, which was hovering in the air in the middle of a tower-top room. Curiously, the whole room was scorched by flame, with broken windows and broken bodies all around, as if blasted by an explosion, possibly a fireball spell.
The Talons next went to Kh√¥ltar in the Shaar, where they sold the Companion for 90,000 gp and a pair of slippers of spider climbing to a strange dwarf who didnt give them his name. This dwarf was never seen without two ravens perched on each shoulder whom he apparently communicated with and even obeyed. (He was likely a minion, willing or unwilling, of the renegade Halruaan sorceresses Halatha and Murbreistra Starnar of Phelzol).
