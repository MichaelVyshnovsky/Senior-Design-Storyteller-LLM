The '''Talons of Timindar''' were an [[adventuring company]] associated with [[Timindar]] in [[Chondath]] in the early 13{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1231}}, the Talons of Timindar explored the overgrown ruins of the city of [[Ilimar]], and encountered [[naga]]s, [[lamia]], and [[giant spider]]s. Then they unexpectedly discovered ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'', a lost holy [[Mielikkian]] [[spellbook]], which was hovering in the air in the middle of a tower-top room. Curiously, the whole room was scorched by flame, with broken windows and broken bodies all around, as if blasted by an explosion, possibly a ''[[fireball]]'' spell.

The Talons next went to [[Kh√¥ltar]] in the [[Shaar]], where they sold the ''Companion'' for 90,000 [[gp]] and a pair of ''[[slippers of spider climbing]]'' to a strange [[dwarf]] who didn't give them his name. This dwarf was never seen without two [[raven]]s perched on each shoulder whom he apparently communicated with and even obeyed. (He was likely a minion, willing or unwilling, of the renegade [[Halruaan]] [[sorceress]]es [[Halatha Starnar|Halatha]] and [[Murbreistra Starnar]] of [[Phelzol]]).
