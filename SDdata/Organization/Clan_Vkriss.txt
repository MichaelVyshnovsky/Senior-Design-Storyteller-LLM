Clan Vkriss was one of the dragonborn clans of the nation of Tymanther.
Clan Vkriss was a prominent clan of Thymari society, although it had a shadowy reputation because of their reputation for dealing with criminals and their heavy-handed political methods. The clan lost prestige at some point before 1479 DR, and never recovered. What remained of its members reorganized themselves into a criminal syndicate. It was also believed that Clan Vkriss was related to the Knights of the Five-Thorned Rose, a Tiamatan cult that dated back to the days of old Unther.
As of 1479 DR, Clan Vkriss has many small legal businesses to cover up their criminal activities.
They were traditional rivals of Clan Tlassian.
