'''Clan Vkriss''' was one of the [[dragonborn]] [[Thymari#Clans|clans]] of the nation of [[Tymanther]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Death before Dishonor|8}}

==History==
Clan Vkriss was a prominent clan of [[Thymari]] society, although it had a shadowy reputation because of their reputation for dealing with criminals and their heavy-handed political methods. The clan lost prestige at some point before [[1479 DR]], and never recovered. What remained of its members reorganized themselves into a criminal syndicate. It was also believed that Clan Vkriss was related to the [[Knights of the Five-Thorned Rose]], a [[Tiamat]]an cult that dated back to the days of old [[Unther]].

As of 1479 DR, Clan Vkriss has many small legal businesses to cover up their criminal activities.

They were traditional rivals of [[Clan Tlassian]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Death before Dishonor|7}}
