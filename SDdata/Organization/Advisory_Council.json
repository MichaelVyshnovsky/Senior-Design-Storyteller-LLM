        "mainbody": "The '''Advisory Council''' of [[Ravens Bluff]] was group of retired city officials, civic-minded [[Nobility of Ravens Bluff|nobles]] and appointees of the [[Lord/Lady Mayor|Lady mayor]] who would publicly debate matters pertaining to the city, and offer their advice to the city's leadership. While they possessed no policy-making authorities they would make recommendations to the [[Council of Lords (Ravens Bluff)|Council of Lords]], [[Merchants Council (Ravens Bluff)|Merchants Council]] or the current Mayor, as they requested.",
        "Members": "''See also: [[:category:Members of the Advisory Council of Ravens Bluff|Members of the Advisory Council of Ravens Bluff]]''<br/>\nThe exact number of members on the Advisory Council varied, but generally numbered somewhere between 20 to 30. A seat on the board came with significant prestige, and those served tended to have a reputation as wise, Ravenian statesmen.\n\nThe council elected their own Lord Speaker, to oversee meetings and act as their representative on the Council of Lords. As of [[1370 DR]], the seat was vacant, though [[Russell Roland|Lord Russell Roland]] served as Acting Speaker.\n\nPrevious Speakers of the Advisory Council included:\n*[[Charles Frederik LaVerne Blacktree IV|Lord Charles Blacktree IV]]\n*[[Mellisa Eldaren]]",
        "History": "The history of the Advisory Council is full of change and to an extent, misrepresentation. While councilors would act as if they operated under long-held traditions and draconian rules, in reality they pretty much did whatever the attending members wished.\n\nIn the time following the [[War of Ravens Bluff|War of 1370]], the relevance of the council put in jeopardy, overshadowed by the formation of the Merchants Council and the election for a new Mayor. However, after the former Lord Mayor [[Charles Oliver O'Kane]] accepted a long-standing invitation to join the council, it experienced renewed vitality and excitement."
