'''Mane's Band''' was an [[adventuring company]] originally based in [[Shadowdale]] and led by the [[human]] [[fighter]] [[Mane (fighter)|Mane]].

==Activities==
Mane, who was described as a charismatic black-bearded man, was a local warrior-hero in Shadowdale. He achieved fame in [[east Faerûn]] as an adventurer and for his martial prowess.

==History==
The group's adventuring career eventually brought them to the [[Yuirwood]] forest in [[Aglarond]]. There they were nearly slain after encountering many dangerous monsters and the [[Red Wizard of Thay]] who summoned them. As a result, they were scattered and disbanded for almost a year before they reformed. They gradually returned to the [[Dalelands]] and took part in the war against [[Lashan Aumersair]] of [[Scardale]] in [[1356 DR]]. Mane himself was the last to rejoin them because he had wandered far in [[Thay]] and was enslaved there for a short period of time.

Following the defeat of Lashan, Mane and his companions departed Shadowdale and relocated to [[Hillsfar]], then east to [[Mulmaster]] and beyond in search of new adventure. They were thought to be wandering the wilderness east of the [[Moonsea]] where Mane had considered establishing a stronghold.

==Relationships==
Mane's Band worked alongside [[Syluné]], [[Storm Silverhand]], and [[Elminster]] to help defend Shadowdale and maintain order during an interregnum period when there was no Lord of the Dale, from the death of [[Jyordhan]] until the reign of [[Doust Sulwood]].{{Cite dragon/196/Three Wizards Too Many|86}}

==Possessions==
Mane owned a two-story house in Shadowdale known as [[Mane's Manor]] located just to the west of [[Mother Tara's Festhall]]. Mane left the deed to the house to [[Mother Tara]] in his will, and she sometimes rented it out for large parties or adventurers staying long periods of time.<ref name="FRCS2r.S-p23>

==Rumors and Legends==
Around the time of the group's adventures in the Yuirwood, there was speculation that Mane had gone south and became a chieftain and war leader of the nomads of the [[Shaar]].

==Members==
There were originally ten members, all of them human males. Throughout the years one left the group and two were slain. He assigned missions to his talented subordinate agent [[Mestrel Hawkmantle]].
