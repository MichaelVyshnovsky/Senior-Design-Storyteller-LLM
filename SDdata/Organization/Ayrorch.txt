The '''Ayrorch''' or '''Council of Twelve''',{{Cite polyhedron/64/The Everwinking Eye: Daily Life in Mulmaster|21}} was the ruling council of the island-nation of [[Lantan]], based in [[Sambar]].

==Activities==
The council consisted of twelve members serving for life, chosen by the council itself. The council elected an ''Ayrar'' to lead and speak for the council, and a ''Lantar'' to represent the nation abroad. The rest of the members were known as the ''Santar'' (ancient [[Lantanese]] for "others").

The Ayrorch was served by the elite agent organization known as the [[Hands of Gond]].
