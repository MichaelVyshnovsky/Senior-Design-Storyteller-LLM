The Ayrorch or Council of Twelve, was the ruling council of the island-nation of Lantan, based in Sambar.
The council consisted of twelve members serving for life, chosen by the council itself. The council elected an Ayrar to lead and speak for the council, and a Lantar to represent the nation abroad. The rest of the members were known as the Santar (ancient Lantanese for "others").
The Ayrorch was served by the elite agent organization known as the Hands of Gond.
