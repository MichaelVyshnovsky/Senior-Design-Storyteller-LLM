The so-called '''Five Furies''' were a group of five women â€“ assistants of the Holycoin Voice of the Lady [[Tharundar Olehm]], from the [[Goldspires]] temple complex of [[Waukeen]] in [[Athkatla]].

==Organization==
Five Furies were known for being beautiful, ambitious, and devote followers of Waukeen's dogma. All five members were [[cleric]]al sister  holding the title of Overgolds within the [[Church of Waukeen]].

==Activities==
Despite being sisters within the religion, the Five Furies played games of intrigue and civil competition for the role of the Holycoin Voice of the Lady's successor.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, Halanna Jashire, the youngest of the Five Furies, started experiencing crippling and life-draining visions sent to her by Waukeen. The goddess was considered dead or missing since the [[Time of Troubles]] at the time, and the visions informed the Five and Holycoin Olehm of their deity being trapped in [[Graz'zt]]'s hellish realm. Holycoin Olehm believed Halanna was favored by Waukeen as the young woman rapidly advanced among the church's ranks to her title of the Overgold, and he put out a word, attracting the attention of brave heroes who would help the imprisoned goddess.

With the return of Waukeen to her former glory and the church going through a renaissance, the Five Furies used their skills, including masterful dancing, to convert many of [[Athkatla]]'s noble houses to the faith. All five women used their influences, manipulation, and family fortune and status to try and gain in the eyes of Tharundar Olehm. After 1370 DR, Daerea Ethgil manipulated reports from southern branches of the Church of Waukeen to Halanna Jashire's family being involved in church members walking away from the worship.
