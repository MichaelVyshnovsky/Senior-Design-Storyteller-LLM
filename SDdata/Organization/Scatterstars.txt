Scatterstars was a noble house of Cormyr.
The Scatterstars made their fortune in the shipping business in Suzail.
Elbryn Scatterstars was the head of the family and served King Dhalmass Obarskyr in the early 1200s DR as something of a seneschal for the Palace. In appreciation for being a discrete caretaker, a cultured host, and an attentive manager, Dhalmass elevated the family to nobles.
