        "mainbody": "he Bards of Nun was given to the trio of bards who participated in the Rotting Wars of Chondath, each with the opposing armies of Arrabar, Reth, and Hlath.\nThe Bards of Nun participated in the conflict and recorded the events for posterity independent from each other. Most notably, the bards chronicles included a rare appearance of a divine being. Independently from each other, the Bards of Nun recorded the appearance of the Lord of Battles â€“ Tempus upon the Fields of Nun. The avatar, or possibly a vision, manifested himself before the infamous historic Battle of Nun. The deity rode on a skeletal steed that exuded blood dripping over the future battlefield. Each of the three armies generals took Tempus presence as a good omen, seeing the Lord of Battles atop a white stallion."
