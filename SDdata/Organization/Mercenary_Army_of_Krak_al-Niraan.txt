The Mercenary Army of Krak al-Niraan was the strong arm of the Brotherhood of the True Flame in Zakhara in 1367 DR.
Funded by Jamal al-Yindannims impressive coffers, the Mercenary Army did not have trouble attracting new recruits. All new recruits needed to first pass a security check conducted by Ali al-Lazanâ€“Jamals Chief Inquisitor. Soldiers who passed the inspection had a geas placed upon them to ensure their complete loyalty.
The strength of the Armys forces as of 1367 DR is listed below
* 10 Captains
* 20 Lieutenants
* 40 Sergeants
* 50 Heavy infantry
* 70 Medium infantry
* 350 Light infantry
* 150 Crossbowmen
* 100 Archers
* 200 Light cavalry
The heavy infantry of the Army was composed completely of skilled hill giants and the medium infantry of ogres.
The Army was maintained in battle-ready status by executing continuous raids on the al-Badia of the Haunted Lands and Furrowed Mountains.
The Army was based in the fortress of Krak al-Niraan within the Weeping Desert of the Haunted Lands, though only a quarter of the forces were present within the fortress at any given time since most of the soldiers were out raiding.
Barzan al-Hiyali was the captain and commander of the Army. A brilliant warmonger genie named Khaizuran devised all of the Armys strategy.
