The '''Mercenary Army of Krak al-Niraan''' was the strong arm of the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]] in [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Organization==
Funded by [[Jamal al-Yindannim]]'s impressive coffers, the Mercenary Army did not have trouble attracting new recruits. All new recruits needed to first pass a security check conducted by [[Ali al-Lazan]]â€“Jamal's Chief Inquisitor. Soldiers who passed the inspection had a ''[[geas]]'' placed upon them to ensure their complete loyalty.

The strength of the Army's forces as of 1367 DR is listed below:
* 10 Captains
* 20 Lieutenants
* 40 Sergeants
* 50 Heavy infantry
* 70 Medium infantry
* 350 Light infantry
* 150 Crossbowmen
* 100 Archers
* 200 Light cavalry

The heavy infantry of the Army was composed completely of skilled [[hill giant]]s and the medium infantry of [[ogre]]s.

==Activities==
The Army was maintained in battle-ready status by executing continuous raids on the [[al-Badia]] of the [[Haunted Lands]] and [[Furrowed Mountains]].

==Base of Operations==
The Army was based in the fortress of [[Krak al-Niraan]] within the [[Weeping Desert]] of the Haunted Lands, though only a quarter of the forces were present within the fortress at any given time since most of the soldiers were out raiding.

==Members==
[[Barzan al-Hiyali]] was the captain and commander of the Army. A brilliant [[warmonger genie]] named [[Khaizuran]] devised all of the Army's strategy.
