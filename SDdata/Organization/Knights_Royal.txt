The '''Knights Royal''' were a knighthood of [[Cormyr]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were formerly known as the [[Kings' Blades]] under [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]].{{Cite dragon annual/2000/After the Dragon: The Kingdom of Cormyr Today|62-63}}

==Possessions==
Each Knight Royal possessed a small, [[everbright]] [[silver]] pendant. It resembled an upright, right-handed gauntlet with a [[Purple Dragons|Purple Dragon]] symbol on the open palm. These served as passkeys of a status only somewhat surpassed by the well-known [[Purple Dragon ring]]s. They secured access to anywhere in any royal fortress, or any person therein, royal or otherwise. Unlike the ''[[Purple Dragon ring]]s'', they did not command obedience from the subjects of the crown.

==Members==
The following were the personal guards of Azoun Obarskyr IV until his death in [[1371 DR]], and then they became the guards of [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]]. Each of them were tall, male humans:
* [[Jostlyn Huntsilver]]
* [[Asbras Orthwood]]
* [[Baeryn Dauntinghorn]]
* [[Albryn Emmarask]]
* [[Ondyn Thundersword]]
* [[Ilbreth Truesilver]]
Each of these Royal Knights commanded three knights of their own.
