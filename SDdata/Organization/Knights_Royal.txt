The Knights Royal were a knighthood of Cormyr in the late 14 century DR. They were formerly known as the Kings Blades under Azoun Obarskyr IV.
Each Knight Royal possessed a small, everbright silver pendant. It resembled an upright, right-handed gauntlet with a Purple Dragon symbol on the open palm. These served as passkeys of a status only somewhat surpassed by the well-known Purple Dragon rings. They secured access to anywhere in any royal fortress, or any person therein, royal or otherwise. Unlike the Purple Dragon rings, they did not command obedience from the subjects of the crown.
The following were the personal guards of Azoun Obarskyr IV until his death in 1371 DR, and then they became the guards of Filfaeril Obarskyr. Each of them were tall, male humans
* Jostlyn Huntsilver
* Asbras Orthwood
* Baeryn Dauntinghorn
* Albryn Emmarask
* Ondyn Thundersword
* Ilbreth Truesilver
Each of these Royal Knights commanded three knights of their own.
