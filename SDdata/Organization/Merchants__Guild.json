        "mainbody": "he Merchants Guild was a guild of merchants in Cormyr active in the midâ€“14 century DR.\nMembership was divided up into districts of Cormyr, each with its own representative.\nThe richest and most influential merchants formed its governing body, the Grand Council. Their titles included Council President and Council Members, while special guests were just that, Council Special Guests.\nMembers paid money to the guild, but the benefits were intangible. Hence not all merchants and business-owners in Cormyr chose to join.\nThe Grand Council held an annual meeting. Typically, they convened in one of Cormyrs major cities, namely Suzail, Marsember, or Arabel, but sometimes they went to a smaller resort town like Gladehap. Members could lobby to host the annual meeting in their own towns, provided they could arrange facilities, accommodation, and quality food and drink. It was a costly enterprise, but also a boost to local economy. On arrival, councilors were gifted a ceremonial food and drink of welcome, such as a piece of elven bread from Evermeet and fresh water in a silver goblet, and a sampling of local produce and crafts in sack woven from silvery mesh. Guests were also granted silver medallions (about 5 sp for the metal alone) from which hung parchments bearing their name, origin, and position in the guild.\nFor the 1367 DR meeting of the Grand Council, Barthelm Meadowbrock arranged to host it in his own town of Ghars, and this was quite a coup for him. He booked the Sheaf of Wheat and Silver Scythe inns to lodge guild members and their retinues (there were too many for just one inn) and even paid for a meeting room to be added to the Silver Scythe. Moreover, he managed provisions, arranged for drinks through the Bold Bard tavern, and brought chefs from Suzail. It was the most exciting thing to happen to Ghars it puffed up local merchants and drew agents of the Iron Throne and Zhentarim the local Purple Dragons arrested one of the former and two of the latter in the two months preceding. Captain Flim of the Purple Dragons oversaw security in Ghars and Mayor Tobald the towns welcome.\nIn the lead-up, townsfolk tidied the streets, washed shop windows, put garlands and wreaths on lampposts, and hung welcoming banners. Council members and their retinues arrived mid-afternoon of Eleint 19. Mayella Meadowbrock, Barthelms daughter, presented each with their gifts and Barthelm gave a welcome speech. The Sheaf of Wheat hosted a grand reception that night. with the main course being Beef and Oysters Barnabas with Westgate Ruby. The main meeting was to be hosted in the Silver Scythe on Eleint 20. Barthelm likely left the Grand Council members blissfully unaware of a foiled plot by the Iron Throne to assassinate them by poisoning the town water supply with blackweed.\n* Barthelm Meadowbrock, Grand Council member and district representative for the area of Ghars."
