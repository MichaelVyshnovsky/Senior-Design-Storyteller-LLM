        "Organization": "Membership was divided up into districts of Cormyr, each with its own representative.\n\nThe richest and most influential merchants formed its governing body, the Grand Council. Their titles included Council President and Council Members, while special guests were just that, Council Special Guests.",
        "Activities": "Members paid money to the guild, but the benefits were intangible. Hence not all merchants and business-owners in Cormyr chose to join.\n\nThe Grand Council held an annual meeting. Typically, they convened in one of Cormyr's major cities, namely [[Suzail]], [[Marsember]], or [[Arabel]], but sometimes they went to a smaller resort town like [[Gladehap]]. Members could lobby to host the annual meeting in their own towns, provided they could arrange facilities, accommodation, and quality food and drink. It was a costly enterprise, but also a boost to local economy.<ref> On arrival, councilors were gifted a ceremonial food and drink of welcome, such as a piece of [[elf|elven]] [[bread]] from [[Evermeet]] and fresh water in a [[silver]] goblet, and a sampling of local produce and crafts in sack woven from silvery mesh. Guests were also granted silver medallions (about 5 [[sp]] for the metal alone) from which hung parchments bearing their name, origin, and position in the guild.",
        "History": "For the [[1367 DR]] meeting of the Grand Council, [[Barthelm Meadowbrock]] arranged to host it in his own town of [[Ghars]], and this was quite a coup for him. He booked the [[Sheaf of Wheat]] and [[Silver Scythe]] inns to lodge guild members and their retinues (there were too many for just one inn) and even paid for a meeting room to be added to the Silver Scythe. Moreover, he managed provisions, arranged for drinks through the [[Bold Bard]] tavern, and brought chefs from Suzail. It was the most exciting thing to happen to Ghars; it puffed up local merchants and drew agents of the [[Iron Throne]] and [[Zhentarim]]; the local [[Purple Dragons]] arrested one of the former and two of the latter in the two months preceding.<ref> Captain [[Flim]] of the Purple Dragons oversaw security in Ghars and Mayor [[Tobald]] the town's welcome.<ref>\n\n{{fq\n| text   = But for most of the party, it was boy's night out.
