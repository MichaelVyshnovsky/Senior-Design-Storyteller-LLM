The '''Heralds of Imphras II''' were couriers who carried news to the far corners of [[Impiltur]] on behalf of the [[Lords of Imphras II]] as of the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The Heralds were couriers and messengers, who travelled by [[horse]]back in bands along Impiltur's major roads, ranging as far as [[Haelimbrar's Watch]]. While their primary role was to bring news from Impiltur's major population centers to the outlying villages, the Heralds more broadly served as a line of communication between the rulers and its common folk. They acted as patrols on the roads which they travelled, with each band being led by a veteran [[fighter]] empowered to enforce the law.

Whenever the Heralds learned of a newcomer to the realm along one of their roads, they sought them out. The Heralds were always courteous and helpful to new arrivals unless they deemed them to be a threat to the people of Impiltur, in which case they proved formidable foes.
