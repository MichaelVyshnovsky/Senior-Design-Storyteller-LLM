The Horthander family had a seat in the Onsruur (council of lords) of Kh么ltar in south Faer没n, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. It was one of twenty such human families that held the reins controlling the Iron City.
This clan was typically tall and pleasingly handsome or beautiful. They developed a passion for race horses and spent much of their time breeding and racing them. By 1372 DR, most of the expansive enclosed gardens of the family estate had been converted to stables for their prized animals.
The Horthanders had many business interests in Kh么ltar. Their flagship enterprise was the Horthander casting foundry, but they also owned dozens of smaller businesses, mostly repair shops and companies that installed plumbing or did masonry, plastering, or painting. They were heavily invested in land throughout Shaareach and Lapaliiya.
The family demesne was a boldly styled klathlaaedin (sculpted stone mansion) named Anthormbrur located at the southeastern end of Hael Way very near Farrgaunlar (the southern gate through the walls of Kh么ltar).
This family had a strong dislike for their next-door neighbors, the Khaundroves, as the result of a longstanding rivalry that existed for decades, perhaps centuries.
