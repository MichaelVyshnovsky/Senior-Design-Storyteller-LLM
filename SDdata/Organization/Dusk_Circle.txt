The Dusk Circle was a druidic circle based in Westwood
Anyone who promised not to fell any trees, and who brought a donation in the name of Silvanus or Mielikki, was granted a night or twos stay within the druids glade.
The three druids of the Dusk Circle would direct the loggers of the nearby town of Kheldell to what areas of the forest they could fell. The woodsmen would then typically plant more trees than were cut down.
