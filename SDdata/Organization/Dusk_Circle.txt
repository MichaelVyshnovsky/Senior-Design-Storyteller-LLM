The '''Dusk Circle''' was a [[druid]]ic circle based in [[Westwood]]

Anyone who promised not to fell any trees, and who brought a donation in the name of [[Silvanus]] or [[Mielikki]], was granted a night or two's stay within the druids' glade.

==Activities==
The three druids of the Dusk Circle would direct the loggers of the nearby town of [[Kheldell]] to what areas of the forest they could fell. The woodsmen would then typically plant more trees than were cut down.

==Members==
*[[Shala Thaeral]], voice of the circle.
