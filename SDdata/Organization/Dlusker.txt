The '''Dlusker''' family was one of the noble [[patriar]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. Having lost most of their wealth, they only owned a handful of meager businesses; among these were a textile manufactory in the [[Lower City]], a few slaughterhouses in the [[Outer City]] and a number of sheep pens located nearby, outside the city walls.

Although the family found moderate success as investors, they experienced great decline during the mid-to-late 1400s and by the [[1482 DR|Year of the Narthex Murders, 1482 DR]], were held in exceptionally low regard.

* [[Norold Dlusker|Lord Norold Dlusker]]: The family's patriarch during the latter half of the 15{{th}} century.

==History==
Unfortunately for the Dluskers, Lord Norold backed the wrong side when he supported [[Grand Duke]] [[Valarken]] during the latter's attempt to seize power as the lone ruler of Baldur's Gate in the mid-1400s. The usurper and his [[lycanthrope]] [[Band of the Red Moon|allies]] were driven from the city, and his allies were left to face the disdain of the remaining Baldurian patriar.

The following years were not kind to the Dlusker family. After Norold's elder sister died from [[mummy rot]], her husband and a majority of the family's wealth disappeared north to the city of [[Waterdeep]]. The Dluskers were left destitute and disgraced and Lord Norold himself had significant debts to pay off.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, a member of the Dlusker family was taken by the [[vampire spawn]]s of [[Cazador Szarr]], a [[vampire lord]] of the [[Lower City]], prompting investigations into the disappearances of several other patriars.
