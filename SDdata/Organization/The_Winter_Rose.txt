The Winter Rose was an adventuring fellowship from Amn, named after the beautiful winter flower – frostrose, active circa 1310 DR.
The Winter Rose was assembled by a paladin who was guided by his unwavering commitment to justice and duty. The name was inspired by the resilience of a frostrose that kept its petals bright red against all odds and cold of the harsh northern winter. The Winter Rose proclaimed themselves to be defenders of the north.
The Winter Rose was established sometime before the , when Sirge de La Sunya heard his fathers, Don DiArmoss deathbed confession. The respected Watcher of Helm reveled to his son about a long-lost daughter, sired in the faraway land of Damara. The daughters mother was a demon slain by Don DiArmos after revealing her true nature to her paladin consort. Don could never find the will to kill his demonic child and left her with a secluded Monastery of the Yellow Rose. Shocked by the deathbed revelations, Sirge de La Sunya denounced his family, House de La Sunya, and left Athkatla in search of his sister.
Sirge de La Sunya took on the alias of the Watcher and was joined by his squire, teacher, and best friend – Kepp Trapmaster, an ex-Shadow Thief. Later, by chance, the duo was joined by a half-elven druid Tianya. Eventually, the Winter Rose found Sirges long-lost sister – a tiefling monk Naleen. The tiefling orphan joined the Winter Rose, not knowing that the groups leader, the Watcher, was her brother. The last two members of the group were Llendril Coe and Dalwynd Meadsbreath. Llendril was a moon elf descendant of the ancient citadel Hand of the Seldarine, who sought reborn of her ancestral home. And Dalwynd was adventuring hin pie bandit who kept his friends spirits up.
