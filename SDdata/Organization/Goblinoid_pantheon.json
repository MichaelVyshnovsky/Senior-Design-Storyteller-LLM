        "Organization": "[[Maglubiyet]] was the chief deity of the goblinoid pantheon. Other members of the pantheon included [[Bargrivyek]], [[Nomog-Geaya]], [[Khurgorbaeyag]], [[Hruggek]], and [[Grankhul]].",
        "History": "Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears once had their own individual pantheons: the [[goblin pantheon]], [[hobgoblin pantheon]], and [[bugbear pantheon]]. However, Maglubiyet killed most of the gods of these pantheons and forced the others to kneel to him. The deities conquered by Maglubiyet thus fell into these two categories. After this, a single unified pantheon was formed: the goblinoid pantheon. The individual deities were now solely subservient to Maglubiyet, the Conquering God. Since Maglubiyet's successful crusade, the other deities feared his power and wrath."
