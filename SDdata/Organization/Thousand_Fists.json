        "mainbody": "The '''Thousand Fists''' were an [[orc]] tribe living on the southern slopes of the [[Nether Mountains]], who had survived since the days of [[Netheril]].",
        "History": "During the time of Netheril, the Thousand Fists proved to be among the most tenacious and troublesome foes that the [[Netherese]] ever faced. They favored hit-and-run attacks and ambushes, using the natural terrain like trees and rocks to the greatest effect, and were also very fond of hacking apart their enemies beyond the necessary amount, leaving disfigured bodies in their wake.\n\nBy the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], they were firmly emplaced within the [[Thousand Maws]] cave system in the Nether Mountains, including the caverns of [[Arraggar]] and [[Oltho]]. They had fought fiercely with the nearby [[Ripped Gut]] tribe of the northern slopes over the control of [[Moon Pass]], but reluctantly formed a truce.",
        "Reputation": "The [[adept]]s of the tribe were notable for having invented ''[[Talisman of spell turning|talismans of spell turning]]''.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 1}}{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 10}}"
