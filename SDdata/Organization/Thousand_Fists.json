        "mainbody": "he Thousand Fists were an orc tribe living on the southern slopes of the Nether Mountains, who had survived since the days of Netheril.\nDuring the time of Netheril, the Thousand Fists proved to be among the most tenacious and troublesome foes that the Netherese ever faced. They favored hit-and-run attacks and ambushes, using the natural terrain like trees and rocks to the greatest effect, and were also very fond of hacking apart their enemies beyond the necessary amount, leaving disfigured bodies in their wake.\nBy the 14 century DR, they were firmly emplaced within the Thousand Maws cave system in the Nether Mountains, including the caverns of Arraggar and Oltho. They had fought fiercely with the nearby Ripped Gut tribe of the northern slopes over the control of Moon Pass, but reluctantly formed a truce.\nThe adepts of the tribe were notable for having invented talismans of spell turning."
