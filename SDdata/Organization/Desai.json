        "mainbody": "The '''Desai''' were a [[Bedine]] tribe located in [[Anauroch]]. By [[1468 DR]], they were nominally under the rule of [[Netheril]].",
        "History": "On the Spring Equinox ([[Ches 19]]) in [[1463 DR]], [[Ruqiah]] (the reincarnated [[Catti-brie]]) was born to [[Kavita]] and [[Niraj]] of the Desai tribe. In [[1468 DR]], the [[Shadovar]] agents [[Untaris]] and [[Alpirs De'Noutess]] attempted to kidnap her on behalf of [[Parise Ulfbinder]], but Ruqiah killed them with her divine magic. Soon after, Ruqiah was forced to flee the tribe but returned regularly to gain magical training from her parents.\n\nIn [[1468 DR]], a Desai encampment of tents was located at the remains of the ancient city [[Rasileth]].",
        "Culture": "Like other Bedine tribes, the Desai were forbidden to practice magic, but some (namely Kavita and Niraj) secretly did so anyway.\n\nA typical outfit of a Desai man was a round, white cotton garment set with a large button and tassel. Like other Bedine, a Desai man wore a ''[[wikipedia:en:Keffiyeh|kufiya]]'' headscarf and an ''[[igal]]'' tie that spoke of their stature in the tribe.\n\nThe Desai's primary gods were [[N'asr]], god of the dead, and [[At'ar]] the Merciless, the Yellow Goddess of the desert.\n\nThe discovery of a wellspring in the desert was celebrated all night long.",
        "Notable members": "* [[Ruqiah]] ([[Catti-brie]]), [[Chosen]] of [[Mielikki]].\n* [[Niraj]], Ruqiah's father, who was a strong and respected man who was secretly trained in magic.\n* [[Kavita]], Ruqiah's mother, who secretly practiced magic.\n* [[Jhinjab]], a man who informed the [[Shadovar]] about Ruqiah's magic.\n* [[Tahnood Dubujeb]], leader of the Desai child gang in [[1468 DR]].",
