In 1468 DR, the Shadovar agents Untaris and Alpirs DeNoutess attempted to kidnap her on behalf of Parise Ulfbinder, but Ruqiah killed them with her divine magic. Soon after, Ruqiah was forced to flee the tribe but returned regularly to gain magical training from her parents.\nIn 1468 DR, a Desai encampment of tents was located at the remains of the ancient city Rasileth.\nLike other Bedine tribes, the Desai were forbidden to practice magic, but some (namely Kavita and Niraj) secretly did so anyway.\nA typical outfit of a Desai man was a round, white cotton garment set with a large button and tassel. Like other Bedine, a Desai man wore a kufiya headscarf and an igal tie that spoke of their stature in the tribe.\nThe Desais primary gods were Nasr, god of the dead, and Atar the Merciless, the Yellow Goddess of the desert.\nThe discovery of a wellspring in the desert was celebrated all night long.\n* Ruqiah (Catti-brie), Chosen of Mielikki.\n* Niraj, Ruqiahs father, who was a strong and respected man who was secretly trained in magic.\n* Kavita, Ruqiahs mother, who secretly practiced magic.\n* Jhinjab, a man who informed the Shadovar about Ruqiahs magic.\n* Tahnood Dubujeb, leader of the Desai child gang in 1468 DR.\n* The Companions\nCategoryTribes\nCategoryBedine tribes\nCategoryHuman organizations\nCategoryOrganizations in Anauroch\nCategoryOrganizations in Netheril\nCategoryOrganizations in North Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations\nteh1fm956ssskd4xhtcqlel99uvh1w5"
