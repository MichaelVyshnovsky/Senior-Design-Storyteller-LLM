The '''Ormitar''' family was a noble merchant family of the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]]. The head of the family sat on the [[High Council]] that governed Tantras.

In [[1358 DR]], shortly after the [[Time of Troubles]], the family was headed by [[Lassalar Ormitar]], who also commanded the [[Guard (Tantras)|Guard]], the military force that defended and policed the city.
