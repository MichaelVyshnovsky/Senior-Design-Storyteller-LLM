Her affliction was cured by Lord [[Maskar Wands]]. Consequently, the family went into deep mourning for their two sons and late heirs.<ref group=\"note\">The text of ''[[City of Splendors (boxed set)|City of Splendors]]'' actually says \"little eight-year-old Citta\" and \"Citta\nHothemer turned into a troll\", but specifies Citta is the consort of Malas and states that Hathin and Robin are her brothers and the former heirs, but Chynna is specified as the next heir. It seems likely that \"Citta\" is in error and \"Chynna\" was intended.",
