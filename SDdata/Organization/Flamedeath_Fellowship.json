        "mainbody": "The Flamedeath Fellowship was a holy slayer organization in Zakhara dedicated to the teachings of Najm, the Zakharan god of adventure, or Kossuth, the Lord of Flames.\nThis group of holy slayers was closely involved with the Brotherhood of the True Flame.\nNewer members followed the teaching of Najm, but the senior members tended to follow Kossuth.\nHoly slayers of the Flamedeath Fellowship were supplied with Greek fire or oil of liquid stars. They used this deadly substance to burn their enemies and their homes to ash.\nA small group of holy slayers from the Fellowship protected a secret temple to Kossuth located within the Court District of Huzuz.\nA particularly nefarious sect of the Fellowship existed in Umara within the Free Cities of Zakhara."
