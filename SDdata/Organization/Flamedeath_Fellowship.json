        "Activities": "This group of holy slayers was closely involved with the [[Brotherhood of the True Flame]].\n\nNewer members followed the teaching of Najm, but the senior members tended to follow Kossuth.\n\nHoly slayers of the Flamedeath Fellowship were supplied with [[Greek fire]] or ''oil of liquid stars.'' They used this deadly substance to burn their enemies and their homes to ash.\n\nA small group of holy slayers from the Fellowship protected a secret temple to Kossuth located within the [[Court District]] of [[Huzuz]].{{cite book/City of Delights/Golden Huzuz|48}}\n\nA particularly nefarious sect of the Fellowship existed in [[Umara]] within the [[Free Cities of Zakhara]].{{cite book/City of Delights/Golden Huzuz|56-57}}"
