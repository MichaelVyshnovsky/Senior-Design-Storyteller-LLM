        "mainbody": "he Daunphar family was one of the elite clans that formed the Onsruur (the council of lords) in Kh√¥ltar, the Iron City, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nThis bloodline had no distinguishing features, leaving them rather plain in appearance. They eschewed politics as much as possible, but kept their hand in as necessary to maintain their position as an Onsruur member.\nThe Daunphars owned ranches and herds of livestock. They also enjoyed breeding horses.\nThis family had some sort of mutually respectful, working relationship with a group of dwarves with questionable ethics that dwelled in the Great Rift."
