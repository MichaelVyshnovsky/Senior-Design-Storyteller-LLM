'''Nishaadhri''', or the '''Bound Ones''', were [[warlocks]] and [[arcane magic|mages]] who swore lifelong fealty to the [[Warlock Knights]] of [[Vaasa]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. They fulfilled roles in Vaasan society similar to those of [[wizards]] or [[priests]] in other realms.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|78}}

==Description==
The term "nishaadhri" did not denote that individuals were members of a specific organization, merely that they were magic-users who served the Warlock Knights and who had formed a special and powerful pact with the [[primordial]] known as [[Telos]].

==Abilities==
When wielding the power of Telos, their magic often manifested in the form of glowing purple tendrils or shooting stars. They were fond of using powers which cursed and debilitated their enemies, and could cast multiple ''[[eldritch blast]]s'' simultaneously. In battle, they sought to establish control over the battlefield with spells that paralyzed or injured multiple foes at once, such as by summoning swarms of meteors.

Some nishaadhri had an ability known as "star trail", which allowed them to enter a luminous state of insubstantiality in which they could fly around their enemies and burn them with radiant light.

==Activities==
Nishaadhri were subordinate to high-ranking Warlock Knights, often serving as their advisors 

Those nishaadhri who attained high enough prestige would be recruited by the [[Voice of Telos]] to join the [[Luminaries]], a sect dedicated to maintaining shrines and temples to Telos.

==History==
When they rose to power in the 15{{th}} century DR, the Warlock Knights feared the potential of spellcasters to challenge their domain, and so it was forbidden to freely practice [[arcane magic]] unless one had sworn lifelong service as a nishaadhri in the Knights' service.

==Notable Nishaadhri==
* [[Saavi]], who served Fellthane [[Kardhel Terov]] during his efforts to gain control over [[Hulburg]] in {{Yearlink|1479}} and {{Yearlink|1480}}.
