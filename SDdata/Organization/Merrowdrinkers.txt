The '''Merrowdrinkers'''<ref group="note" name="note1">Given the lack of [[Merrow|any]] [[Merrow (ogre)|merrow]] for hundreds of miles of the Goblin Marches, and their lack of drinkability, it is presumed that this is a spelling error and the intended name is '''Marrowdrinkers'''. were a tribe of [[hobgoblin]]s in the [[Goblin Marches]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Relationships==
The Merrowdrinkers had an alliance with the [[Neidlig]] [[goblin]] tribe, and settled close to [[Neidlig Citadel]].
