The Corsair Council was the main governing body of Hawa. They were lenient on crime so long as the city was not threatened, and many vices forbidden in mainland Zakhara were practiced openly and tolerated by the Council.
Most, if not all, of the corsair captains took part of the Council in some manner, but only the votes of the most prominent members were heeded. These individuals are listed below
* Jayani al-Jasir
* Akura al-Hiyali
* Grima al-Auni min Kor
* Suhailah al-Hawai
* Hamid al-Bashshar
* Shing Jaw-long
