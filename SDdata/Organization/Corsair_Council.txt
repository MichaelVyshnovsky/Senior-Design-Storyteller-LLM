The '''Corsair Council''' was the main governing body of [[Hawa]]. They were lenient on crime so long as the city was not threatened, and many vices forbidden in mainland [[Zakhara]] were practiced openly and tolerated by the Council.

==Organization==
Most, if not all, of the [[corsair]] captain's took part of the Council in some manner, but only the votes of the most prominent members were heeded. These individuals are listed below:
* [[Jayani al-Jasir]]
* [[Akura al-Hiyali]]
* [[Grima al-Auni min Kor]]
* [[Suhailah al-Hawai]]
* [[Hamid al-Bashshar]]
* [[Shing Jaw-long]]
