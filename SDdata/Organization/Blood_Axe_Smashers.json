        "mainbody": "The Blood Axe Smashers, who were also called the Smashers, were a Zhentilar patrol of wicked humanoids that operated out of Darkhold during the mid-14 century DR.\nThe symbol of the Smashers was a large skull on a purple field which was designed to be an insult to the Purple Dragons.\nThe group was led by an scro named Thergod. Those under Thergods command included sixteen ogres and a trio of hill giants. \nThe Blood Axe Smashers had never been defeated in battle and were skilled in setting elaborate ambushes for their targets. The Smashers were such a threat that King Azoun Obarskyr IV offered a reward of 2,000 gp for their destruction."
