The Ruby Blades were delayed, and by the time they arrived the Wolfmasters had been slain by a cornugon devil. Running into Cormyrean adventurers sent by Lord Partic Thistle to find the Wolfmasters, the Ruby Blades abandoned the Orvaskyte Keep mission, instead turning to hunting a local black dragon. Utterly outclassed, they fled with the dragon in pursuit, only to be saved by the Cormyrean adventurers. They were then reinforced by two-dozen Sembian mercenaries, and went on to secure Orvaskyte Keep for their own delving.\n* Ranni Stalkersdaughter, co-leader and ranger.\n* Pyrra Flamedancer, co-leader and wizard.\n* Arpeggi Trill, a dramatic bard.\n* Dendir Abbathorson, a dwarf rogue.\n* Zurk the Looney, an insane fighter."
