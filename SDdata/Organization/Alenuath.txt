House Alenuath was a sun elf house on Evermeet.
Unusually for sun elves, its members were typically rangers, hunters, or others who spent a great deal of time alone.
Although the house had a small manse in Leuthilspar, it was often unoccupied for extended periods. During this time, it was cared for by moon elf servants.
As of 1368 DR, the house was led by Thalanil Alenuath.
Haramaras bow was a non-magical bow that had great significance in the house.
The houses colours were gray and green.
