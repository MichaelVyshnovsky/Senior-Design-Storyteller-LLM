House '''Alenuath''' was a [[sun elf]] house on [[Evermeet]].

Unusually for sun elves, its members were typically [[ranger]]s, hunters, or others who spent a great deal of time alone.

Although the house had a small manse in [[Leuthilspar]], it was often unoccupied for extended periods. During this time, it was cared for by [[moon elf]] servants.

As of [[1368 DR]], the house was led by [[Thalanil Alenuath]].

''[[Haramara's bow]]'' was a non-magical bow that had great significance in the house.

The house's colours were gray and green.

==Members==
* [[Haramara Alenuath]], the founder of the house.
* [[Thalanil Alenuath]], leader of the house in [[1368 DR]].
