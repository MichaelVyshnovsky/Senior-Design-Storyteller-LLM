        "mainbody": "The '''Cult of Karsus''', also called the '''Church of Karsus''', was a collection primarily of [[wizard]]s and specialty priests called [[Heartblood]]s who worshiped [[Karsus]], the Momentary God.",
        "Organization": "The Cult faded away before any kind of formal hierarchy could be established, with the only title or rank being the Heartbloods.",
        "Activities": "Most cult members concerned themselves with the daily operations of [[Karse]], primarily mining metal deposits from the [[Star Mounts]].",
        "Celebrations": "Ritual after ritual was performed with the hopes of resurrecting their god, most of which were inspired by dream visions of the Cult's leaders. Most of these rituals involved a synchronization with the beating heart statue of Karsus.",
        "Base of Operations": "The most notable location for the Cult was the [[Shrine of the Undying Heart]] which stood atop the butte near Karse where Karsus' fell. The inhabitants of Karse in [[-298 DR]] formed the foundations of the Cult that lasted only for ten years. Followers within the Cult believed Karsus would somehow return and restore the power of [[Netheril]].",
        "Dogma": "The Cult taught that the fall of civilization, specifically Netheril, was a prime example of [[human]] folly and pride and a result of the punishment of the gods. It was believed that Karsus would be reborn to deliver humanity into a new golden age tempered with the experience of the past.",
        "Orders": "The [[Order of Thaumaturgists]] was composed of Cult members who performed [[spell]] research."
