        "mainbody": "lan Black Axe were a dwarven clan that resided in the Temple of Dumathoin, and mines, far beneath the plains of Icewind Dale in the mid–14 century DR.\nThe dwarves were worshipers of Dumathoin, and erected a three-cavern high temple to him.\nThe dwarven clan had a long history of being forced out of their home and battling with the drow, mainly in the Cavern of Cloven Heads.\nThe most well known battle occurred when the drow priestess, Menzoberra the Kinless, led several refugees from Great Bhaerynden towards the to-be city of Menzoberranzan.\nIn approximately −3917 DR, Clan Black Axe fought Menzoberras drow bravely, but most of the clan had to retreat. A handful of \"Brave Beards\" stood their ground, allowing the rest to flee. Those dwarven heroes ultimately fell, but managed to slay half the invading drow. The last dwarf to fall, Dorn Black Axe, was wrecked by spasms from the deadly drow poison. Dorn sank slowly into the stones and was gone. \nThe clan later reclaimed their cavern and erected a cairn, inscribed with Dethek runes, to those who had fallen in battle. However, they were again forced to abandon them, due to the collapse of Ammarindar. Uthgardt grimlocks occupied then occupied the cavern. The nomadic people came to revere the Dethek inscriptions on the fallen rocks, written by the dwarves about the tale of the \"Brave Beards\". These rocks were on top of the remains of Dorn Black Axe, which had become one with the stony cavern floor.\nClan Black Axe relocated closer to Menzoberranzan, where they built a more defensible temple to Dumathoin. Although better defended, they fell again in a raid by a drow house that was both in conflict with House Barrison DelArmgo and allied with the derro. The clan was overwhelmed by the dark elves and their derro allies. The derro would not have been able to take the temple as their new home without the aid of the drow warriors. In exchange for the drow houses help, the derro immediately launched an attack against House Barrison DelArmgo.\n* Dorn Black Axe"
