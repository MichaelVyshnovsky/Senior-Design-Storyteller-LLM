Agundar () was a noble house of Waterdeep, of Tethyrian descent, that had a history within the city spanning over three hundreds years up to the 14 century DR.
The Agundar family was officially ennobled in 1116 DR. As of 1368 DR, the patriarch of the family was Torres Agundar. The consort at this time was his 23-year-old fiance, Lynneth Sinmeklos and the family heir was Torres 27-year-old son from his first marriage, Torres Agundar II.  At this time there were approximately twenty-nine members of the family.
They were known for their work with mercenaries, martial-training and weapon-forging.
Like most Waterdhavian nobles, the Agundar family kept a villa in the citys North Ward, on the south side of Hassantyrs Street between Shield Street and Copper Street.
