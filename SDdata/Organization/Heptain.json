        "mainbody": "The '''Heptain''' were a small group of philosophers in the city of [[Cimbar]] in [[Chessenta]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]], active by [[1357 DR]].\n\nFollowing Heptios's argument that passions would lead people into reckless and dangerous behavior, and that emotion must be overcome by rational thought, the Heptain educated others on the importance of philosophy and rationalism compared to superstition. Meanwhile, Heptios stayed in their houses."
