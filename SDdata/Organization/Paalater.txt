'''Paalater''' was a noble family of [[Amn]] that held the Baron and Baroness titles as of the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
As of the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Paalater family included at least three members: Baroness Paalater, her husband, and their daughter, young debutante [[Alicia Paalater]]. The young Paalater woman was enamored with Count [[Claylan]] to disdain of Lady [[Lasalla]], who experienced Claylan's amorous ways of using naive youths.
