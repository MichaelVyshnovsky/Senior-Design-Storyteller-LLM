'''House Dhuurniv''' was a [[drow]] house in [[Maerimydra]] and the only house to survive the fall of Maerimydra in [[1372 DR]]. This was due in part to the fact that they had holdings outside the city. Following their escape from the city, they fell in with the [[Zhentarim]]'s conquest of [[Shadowdale]].

==History==
Prior to the [[Weeping War]], Matron Mother [[Laele Dhuurniv]] led the Maerimydran forces who wished to reclaim the [[Land Under Shadow]]. She accepted the truce that [[Aolis Ildacer]] offered the drow but was killed by Aolis's wife [[Amara Ildacer]].

After the events of the [[Weeping War]] ([[711 DR|711]]â€“[[714 DR]]), House Dhuurniv was shunned by the other drow houses in Maerimydra for negotiating with the surface [[elves]], despite regaining the [[Twisted Tower of Ashaba|Twisted Tower]] in the process. The three [[Matron Sisters]] withdrew largely from Maerimydra and took up residence mostly beneath the Twisted Tower.

After the [[Silence of Lolth]] of [[1372]]/[[1373 DR]], the drow of Dhuurniv found themselves as the most powerful house left in Maerimydra. Despite the deaths of both [[Kurgoth Hellspawn]] and [[Irae T'sarran]] to a band of adventurers, House Dhuurniv was unsuccessful in reclaiming the city and decided to relocate fully to the Twisted Tower.

Some time afterward, House Dhuurniv was contacted by [[Esvele Greycastle]] and agreed to an alliance between the [[Zhentarim]], the [[Church of Shar]], and their House. Together they took over [[Shadowdale]] briefly in [[1374 DR]].
