        "mainbody": "The Knights of the Five-Thorned Rose were an order of warriors and crusaders devoted to the Dragon Queen Tiamat and her spawn, based in Unther and Tymanther.\nOriginally, the Knights of the Five-Thorned Rose were drawn from the elite ranks of the Serpent Guards and were tasked with the destruction of the followers of Bahamut, especially metallic dragons. In the ten years from 1360 to 1370 DR, the Knights of the Five-Thorned Rose had killed many good-aligned dragons, and they had many libraries that guarded the dragon lore they had accumulated over the millennia.\nThe Knights of the Five-Thorned Rose survived the destruction of their country during the Spellplague. By 1479 DR, it was believed that the high-ranking members of the dragonborn clan Vkriss, believed to be involved in many criminal activities, were members of the order of the Knights of the Five-Thorned Rose."
