The Heroes of the Wide were a group of adventurers famed for their heroic acts in the Wide, a large market area in Baldurs Gate.
The party were known to adventure around Baldurs Gate, and were even allowed through toll gates free of charge.
On Returning Day in 1482 DR, Grand Duke Abdel Adrian gave a speech in the Wide. During the speech, Viekang, a Bhaalspawn, strode towards Abdel with his shortsword in hand. Onlookers scattered in fear, stopping the guards from getting close to the stage. The winner of the duel, either Abdel or Viekang, transformed into the Slayer, a ravaging beast of Bhaal. Fortunately, the heroes-to-be were nearby, and were able to subdue the creature.
After their success, the heroes were greeted by civilians and guards alike. However, certain citizens in positions of power also took interest in the heroes. The heroes were approached by Imbralym Skoond on behalf of Duke Torlin Silvershield, followed by Ulder Ravengard, who would now lead the Flaming Fist after Abdels death. As the heroes left the Wide, a bearded young lad signaled to the party, whilst he helped set up a fallen fruit stall. On behalf of Rilsa Rael and the Guild, he explained to the heroes that they shouldnt trust any of the men. Each of the parties wished to recruit the heroes to their side, and directed them towards their respective bases.
