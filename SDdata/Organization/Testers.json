        "mainbody": "The Testers were a fanatical and radical band of Tymoran priests who took extreme risks to spread the glory of their goddess, believing that testing their luck proved their love and trust for Tymora. Given the choice between a safe approach and one with little margin for error, they would rely on the flashier but more difficult approach.\nFellow Tymorans who did not subscribe to the radical notions of the Testers still supported them by healing or raising those who tested their luck and found it wanting."
