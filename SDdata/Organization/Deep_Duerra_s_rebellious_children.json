        "History": "During her reign in [[Hammergrim]], the goddess Deep Duerra, daughter of the god [[Laduguer]], produced a substantial number of heirs. Driven by her natural paranoia, the goddess converted her sanctum into an inaccessible place with no entrance for her ill-wishers or exit for her children. Fed up with the overbearing nature of their ominous mother, the children started devising schemes to break free from her confinement.\n\nThey decided to drug the Keykeeper of [[Deep Duerra's vaults]]. Under the veil of night, the children discreetly ventured into the vaults and plundered their mother's treasures, desperately seeking anything that might assist in their getaway. They found no useful things during their fruitless exploration of the vault and left it disheartened. Yet, the following morning, the son of the Vault Keykeeper, who admired the children, sought them out. He held an abundance of shadow-forged items for them, which were distributed among the children.\n\nWith all preparations in place for their escape, the younger children suddenly grew anxious, fearing their mother's retribution should she discover their intentions. It fell upon the older siblings to invest efforts in persuading them to commit to the plan.\n\nThrough their unity, they found success making their way through the traps that filled Hammergrim. As they approached the last challenge, they unexpectedly faced Duerra and her court, causing the sparks of hope in their hearts to fade away. The goddess was consumed by fury and ready to punish her na√Øve offspring. To the astonishment of everyone, [[Ludmilla]], the reserved and tearful daughter who was most under her mother's control, picked up the [[Least Expected|bow]] and let loose an arrow. The arrow flashed and, while Duerra and her blinded court wailed impotently, the children made their escape into the world unknown to them.\n\nThe fate of the children after that is unknown.{{Speculation}}",
