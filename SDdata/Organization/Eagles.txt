The Eagles were a group of hobgoblin soldiers, who served the Preachers in the fortress of Sarahin in 1367 DR.
The Eagles were based in the fortress of Sarahin, located deep within the Haunted Lands.
The Eagles were well-trained but lacked experience, since the fortress of Sarahin had not been attacked in living memory.
All of the members of the Eagles were hobgoblins, save their commander, Mamoud ibn Asra, who was a dwarf.
