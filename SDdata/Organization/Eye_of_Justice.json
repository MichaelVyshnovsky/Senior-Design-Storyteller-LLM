Although the church was regarded as a heresy by Torms followers, Torm apparently granted power to some of its members.\t\nThe order was governed by the Council of Vigilant Seers and had few female members. By 1480 DR, many members of the Eye had abandoned the Threefold God heresy and worshiped Torm exclusively.\nIn the , Gedrin a young member of the Night Masks thieves guild in Westgate, had a vision in which Helm and Tyr fought, with Tyr slaying Helm. After he died, Helms essence melded with Tyrs and Tyrs sight returned. When Gedrin woke from his vision, he held Helms sword, Vindicator. Later, Gedrin had another vision in which Tyr was killed by the demon lord Orcus and Tyrs essence flowed into Torms, making Torm the Threefold God. Gedrin became a religious zealot and recruited crusaders from among the Night Masks. The church was instrumental in driving the Night Masks from Westgate in the .\nLater, the church became corrupted and Gedrin left Westgate in disgust. He traveled to the Sword Coast where sometime in the 1460s DR he met a child rogue named Kalen Dren begging on the streets of Luskan. He gave Vindicator to Kalen and recruited him into the church. Kalen later became the churchs primary crusader.\n*Gedrin Thalavar, founder of the order and the first Shadowbane\n*Haran of Elversult\n*Hessar\n*Gorverim, Mulan mage\n*Jhorak\n*Kalen Dren, Shadowbane as of 1480 DR\n*Levia Shadewalker, Spymistress\n*Lord Sephalus\n*Rhetegast Hawkwinter, heir to Vindicator and Shadowbane title\n*Rsalya of Selgaunt\n*Shae-Lan, Mulan warrior\n*Uthias Darkwell, Chief of the Council\n*Vaelis, dark crusader of Hoar and claimant of the Shadowbane title\n*Vaulren"
