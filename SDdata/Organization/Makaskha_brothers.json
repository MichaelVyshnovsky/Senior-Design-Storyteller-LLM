        "Activities": "Though it was commonplace for disagreements between merchants and customers in Tajar to be settled with swords, the Makaskha brothers took this savage interaction to the next level with an act known locally as the \"Tajar tongue.\" If a customer made a poor offer to one of the brothers, they were held down and had their tongue removed with a razor."
