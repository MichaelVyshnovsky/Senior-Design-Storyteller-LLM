        "mainbody": "The Forbidden was a group of people cursed by the True Gods to live in isolation on Jazirat al-Gawwar in deep southern Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nThe Forbidden lived in isolation for 400 years on Jazirat al-Gawwar. All memory of their previous existence was erased from the records of the outside world.\nThe Forbidden hailed from Takabbar, but their denial of the existence of the True Gods incited divine vengeance against them. Ironically, the gods decreed that none would know of the existence of the people who had denied them.\nOne god pitied them Hakiyah. Hakiyah decreed that the Forbiddens isolation would cease on the day they understood True Sorrow. Hakiyah placed the Tower of the Test in Takabbar where the Forbidden could one day defeat the challenge that cursed them."
