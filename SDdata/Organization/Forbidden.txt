The '''Forbidden''' was a group of people cursed by the [[Zakharan pantheon|True Gods]] to live in isolation on [[Jazirat al-Gawwar]] in deep southern [[Zakhara]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
The Forbidden lived in isolation for 400 years on Jazirat al-Gawwar. All memory of their previous existence was erased from the records of the outside world.

The Forbidden hailed from [[Takabbar]], but their denial of the existence of the True Gods incited divine vengeance against them. Ironically, the gods decreed that none would know of the existence of the people who had denied them.

One god pitied them: [[Hakiyah]]. Hakiyah decreed that the Forbidden's isolation would cease on the day they understood [[True Sorrow]]. Hakiyah placed the [[Tower of the Test]] in Takabbar where the Forbidden could one day defeat the challenge that cursed them.
