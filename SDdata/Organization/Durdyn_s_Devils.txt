'''Durdyn's Devils''' were a small mercenary band, mainly composed of [[drow]] adventurers. As of {{yearlink|1372}}, they were investigating [[Sonjar's Tower]] for information on the [[Faerûnian pantheon|gods]] of [[Faerûn]] on behalf of [[House Vrasl]], while hoping to uncover some [[Imaskari]] secret on how to thwart the gods. House Vrasl thought such secrets could be used to uncover the reason for [[Lolth]]'s silence.

==Members==
[[Durdyn]] was a drow [[fighter]] of great skill who had adapted himself to sunlight. He wielded an [[anarchic]] [[greatsword]].

[[Ewa]] was a [[tiefling]] [[monk]] and a [[Thayan]] refugee, who had been initiated as a [[monk of the Long Death]]. She had grown wings through her bloodline.

[[Rayeth á el Kapyn]] was a [[half-drow]] fighter from the streets of [[Undrek'Thoz]]. He had impressed Durdyn with his exceptional fighting skills and also his open disdain of the drow matriarchy. He fought with a [[spiked chain]].

[[Arrak Abaeir]] was a [[rogue]], and Durdyn's right hand. He favored the use of a [[crossbow]] tipped with [[poison]] [[bolt]]s.

[[Xi'an]] and [[Karushon]] were siblings assigned to monitor Durdyn's activities. Xi'an was an [[arachnomancer]], against her family's wishes; she had positioned herself to seize control of House Vrasl upon her return. Karushon was a senior mage of the same house.

==Others==
A young adult dragon, [[Shianax]], was acting as their guide; her lair was a day's walk from the geode, in the [[Raurin]] desert.
