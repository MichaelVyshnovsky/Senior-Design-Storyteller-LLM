The Agrivars were a prominent noble family of the North in the 1350s DR, producing the renowned wizard Ostus Agrivar and his children the famed adventurers Kyriani and Priam Agrivar.
The family seat was the Agrivar estate on Mount Sar, east of the High Road out of Waterdeep along the Sword Coast North. Their home there was called Ostuss Hold.
The family crest was a sable griffin rampant—that is, a black griffin standing with forelegs raised and facing to the left.
