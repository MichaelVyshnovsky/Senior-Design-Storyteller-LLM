        "mainbody": "he Numtanajd were a tribe of primitive Zakharans inhabiting Fabada near the Mountains of Forgotten Dreams in 1367 DR.\nThese people herded sheep in the pastures at the foot of the mountains. Though considered to be simple-minded disgusting heathens by the enlightened tribes of the High Desert, the people of the Numtanajd had established one of the most durable communities throughout west Zakhara. The Numtanajd placated their neighbors with gifts of mutton, wool, and rakiq. Traders enjoyed dealing with them for these same items  since they did not bother to barter.\nAs a whole these people were peaceful and treated complete strangers as family so long as they respected all of their many taboos. Some of these bizarre beliefs included covering their nose and mouth with wool veils to ward of evil spirits, refusing to eat mutton without first apologizing to a living sheep, and taking the first step of the day with the left foot. A visitor might be expected to contribute a lock of their hair for good luck.\nThe Numtanajd were descended from three familiesâ€“al-Shazzi, al-Waughiwan, and al-Zab. Custom forbade marriage between different tribes but they intermingled for other activities."
