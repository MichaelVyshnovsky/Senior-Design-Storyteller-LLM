Employers were required to also pay for transportation, food, and additional equipment. They payed shares to the beneficiaries of slain members. They charged 1500 gold pieces per week for their services, or 300 gp per day for shorter jobs.\nThe Society was founded in the mid-1200s DR. During Stilmuss leadership, the Society was obsessed by honor and developed a grudge against the Renegades."
