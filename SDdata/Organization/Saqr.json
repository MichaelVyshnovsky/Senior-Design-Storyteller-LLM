        "History": "The Saqr established their home on a crystal island in the center of the Poison Sea, near a crystal they believed was the heart of a dead [[god]], in hopes of using the dormant power of this item to elevate one of them to godhood. Something went wrong, however, and the energies from the crystal killed most of the Saqr and transformed the few survivors into aberrant crystal [[undead]]."
