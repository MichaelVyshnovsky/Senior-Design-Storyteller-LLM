        "mainbody": "he Saqr was a small tribe of genasi who lived on an island in the Poison Sea of Relmaur, Laerakond.\nThe Saqr established their home on a crystal island in the center of the Poison Sea, near a crystal they believed was the heart of a dead god, in hopes of using the dormant power of this item to elevate one of them to godhood. Something went wrong, however, and the energies from the crystal killed most of the Saqr and transformed the few survivors into aberrant crystal undead."
