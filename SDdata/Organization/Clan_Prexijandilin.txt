Clan Prexijandilin was one of the dragonborn clans of the nation of Tymanther.
Members of Clan Prexijandilin used enamel primroses pierced into their cheeks as their distinctive clan piercings. Females also added a few ones to the tips of their plumes.
Clan Prexijandilin was considered one of the most warlike clans of Tymanther, to the point that some considered ironic that their emblem was a flower.
Clan Prexijandilin had a prominent role of the defense of Tymanther during the invasion by the ash giants in 1479 DR.
During the Second Sundering, Clan Prexijandilin lost most of their lands, located to the north of Djerad Thymar, when Abeir and Toril exchanged lands.
