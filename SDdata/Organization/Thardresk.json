        "mainbody": "'''Thardresk''' was the royal house of [[Anauria]], one of the three [[Lost Kingdoms]] that emerged from ancient [[Netheril]].",
        "Members": "It was one of Anauria's three great [[human]] houses, situated above the noble houses of [[Maluradek]] and [[Nemrin]].\n\nBoth King [[Thausimbel Thardresk|Thausimbel the Wise]], and his daughter [[Shaddara|Queen Shaddara the Fair]] were members of House Thardresk.",
        "History": "Under the leadership of House Thardresk, Anauria was able to forge lasting peaceful relations with nearby [[elven]] communities, the [[dwarves]] of [[Oghrann]], and even those men that dwelled around the [[Dragonreach]].\n\nA number of Anauria tombs were built across the kingdom throughout its existence in northern Faerûn. Having been linked to House Thardresk over time, rumors formed that some of these crypts held the ruins of King Thausimbel the Wise, most notably the tomb in the [[Serpent Hills]] and a temple of [[Jergal]] in the capital city of [[Amazandar]]. Both of these sets of catacombs were false leads, actually housing a network of ''[[portal]]s'' that linked to the perilous [[Dungeon of Swords]].\n\nLike the other great houses of Anauria, signs of the Thardresk family could still be found across the ruins of Anauria in the [[Anauroch]] desert ''circa'' the [[Era of Upheaval]], centuries after the kingdom's fall."
