        "mainbody": "The '''Lady's Lament''' was an adventuring troupe from the City of Splendors, [[Waterdeep]], active ''circa'' [[1310 DR]].",
        "Activities": "The Lady's Lament was known for being a group of quiet, soft-spoken, and somewhat melancholic adventurers. They built a reputation of stepping up to help those in need and not being afraid of a challenge, even dangerous tasks other adventuring troupes declined.",
        "History": "The Lady's Lament was established several years before the {{YearlinkName|1310}}. The group's first member and leader was [[Sheris Lyricist]], a rich, spoiled, and willful daughter of a Waterdhevian noble house. When faced with a prospect of an arranged marriage organized by her father, Sheris ran away from home and took on a mantle of a [[bard]]. Later, she was joined by a [[half-orc]]ish couple who were not accepted by either [[human]]s nor [[orc]]s. [[Geldin]] and [[Khatja]] became the company's muscle. The adventurers later were joined by [[Laeris]], a quiet [[cleric]] of [[Ilmater]], a [[drow]] [[sorceress]] [[Vraedna]] who abandoned worship of [[Lolth]] and wanted to build a reputation of being a good dark elf, and lastly, a cheerful [[hin]] [[rogue]] [[Kylie]].\n\nIn 1310 DR, the Lady's Lament, along with many other mercenaries, traveled from [[Luskan]] to the besieged city of [[Targos]] in the [[Ten Towns]] of [[Icewind Dale]]."
