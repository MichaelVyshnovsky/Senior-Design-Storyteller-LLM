The '''Legion of Bone''' was a militaristic group of [[undead]] commanded by [[Szass Tam]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It comprised "soldiers" of skeletal undead cavalry.

The order fought in battles alongside [[Cyric's Legion]], another Thayan undead contingent, named after the ascended mortal [[Cyric]].
