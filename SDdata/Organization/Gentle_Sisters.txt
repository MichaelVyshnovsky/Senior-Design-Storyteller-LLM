The '''Gentle Sisters''' was a name given to a small group of [[goddess]]es of the [[Faerûnian pantheon]]: [[Selûne]], [[Eldath]], [[Sune]], and [[Mielikki]]. They were not actually sisters and the name was bestowed on them by "less gentle beings".

==History==
When the gods were cast down to the mortal world by [[Ao]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, the Gentle Sisters were the only ones who prayed to the [[overgod]] for guidance on how they should comport themselves. Yet they fell like the others, arriving separately on [[Toril]], though Ao gave each his answer afterwards.
