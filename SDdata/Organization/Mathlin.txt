The '''Mathlin''' family was a noble merchant family of the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]]. The head of the family sat on the [[High Council]] that governed Tantras.

In [[1358 DR]], shortly after the [[Time of Troubles]], the Mathlins were allied with the [[Aldimer]] and [[Uruthkurt]] families.
