The '''Dukars'''  were a group of [[Serôs]]ian [[wizard]]s who used [[coral]] implants to channel their magic. Their goal was the protection of Serôs from all kinds of menaces and to promote peace and harmony between all races.

==Organizations==
The dukars were divided into five orders: Nantari, Jhimar, Kupav, Maalirn, and Numos. Furthermore, two different dukar paths existed: the [[Lorekeeper (Serôsian)|lorekeeper]] and the [[peacekeeper]].

The order of Nantari was destroyed in early fighting between the orders and the order of Jhimar died out before the 1370s DR.

==History==
An early form of dukars existed among the [[elven high mage]]s in [[Cormanthor]], but they evolved further after migrating to [[Serôs]]. The true dukars were founded by the [[triton]] [[Dukar (individual)|Dukar]], the near-mythical first Grand Master and teacher of the Four Founders, during the early days of ancient [[Aryselmalyr]]. After 8,000 years, they surveyed the peace and harmony of Serôs, gathering in their ranks beings of many races, including [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[storm giant]]s, and even [[koalinth]] and [[ixitxachitl]].
However, internal strife emerged among the dukars and they fought among themselves until they disappeared. However, a small group of dukars survived until [[1369 DR]] and revealed themselves again during the [[Twelfth Serôs War]].

By that point, they were nearly forgotten. Out of the four orders, Jhimar was already gone, and the entire order's number was dwindling away. While they did try to gain new recruits to avoid dying out,
