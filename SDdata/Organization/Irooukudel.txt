The '''Irooukudel''' were a group of [[Tuigan]] priests who lived within the vale of [[Ejen Horo]] in the [[Hordelands]].

==Activities==
The main responsibility of the Irooukudel was to watch over the bodies of the honored dead of the Tuigan who were buried in Ejen Horo. They were quite fanatical and willing to die for their cause.

Khans or other wealthy Tuigans were buried in tombs marked with statues. However, most of those interred in Ejen Horo were given a [[wind burial]].
