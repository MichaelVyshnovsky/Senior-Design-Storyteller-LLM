One, when on a new moon when the sky was covered by clouds, the priests would emerge into the Land Above to celebrate a ritual called the Foreshadowing, which started at midnight and ended before dawn.\n\nThey also celebrated the \"Deliverance Unto Darkness\" each Midwinter's Eve, giving thanks for the long-along liberation of the first members from the drow. This celebration typically involved sacrificing a monstrous spider or some other creature or being closely associated with [[Lolth]]. Then, long chains of Ibrandulin would cast ''[[dark path]]'' and wander through the Underdark without light, trusting in their deity to guide them to safety.",

Remain steadfast to him, and he will stand by you.\"|Dogma taught to the Initiates of Enveloping Darkeness}}",
