The '''Piiradost''' ({{Pronounce|PEER|ah|dohst|refs=}}) family were part of the [[nobility of Waterdeep]] since the late 12{{th}} century [[DR]]. Their primary business interests were in breeding [[horse]]s and raising [[cattle]].

==Organization==
As of [[1357 DR]], the patriarch of the family was Lord [[Humbraz Piiradost III]]. His consort was Lady [[Kymiko Piiradost|Kymiko]], his fourth wife and a native of [[Kozakura]]. The heir to the title was his second son, [[Humbraz Piiradost IV|Humbraz IV]], but the young scion was enjoying the vices available in the City of Splendors and not keenly interested in learning how to run the family businesses. As of [[1372 DR]], the family had seventeen living members that could claim nobility.

==Activities==
The Piiradosts bred horses and raised cattle in the environs around Waterdeep.

==Base of Operations==
[[File:North Ward-Crommor-Piiradost-Thunderstaff-Talmost-Thann Villa.png|thumb|right|270px|''The Piiradost family villa (labeled <code>N7</code>) ''circa'' 1372 DR.'']]
The Piiradost family compound was just off the busy [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]] to the east on [[Sashtar Street]]. The walled villa covered the corner of the block formed by the north side of Sashtar and the west side of [[Windborne Way]]. The compound was composed of  uniquely designed one- and two-story buildings surrounding a green space. Across the alley behind the residence was the [[Crommor]] villa. Just across Sashtar to the south was the villa of the [[Talmost]] family.

==History==
The Piiradost family was ennobled in Waterdeep in the {{yearlinkName|1178}}.

In the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, there were whispers around town that the Piiradosts were dabbling in the [[slavery|slave]] trade. The sudden disappearance of the eldest son, [[Farlond Piiradost|Farlond]], was the cause of idle speculation that he botched a huge trade deal that almost brought the family to financial ruin. The rumors had some basis in truth. The laborer [[Hemmerem]] was working on a caravan team hauling cargo to Waterdeep when he discovered that the cargo was mostly likely slaves, even though he was told they were "hired servants and specialists from the South". When the caravan reached the city, Hemmerem felt his life was in danger. He narrowly avoided an assassination attempt and found evidence that the oldest son of Lord Piiradost wrote the order for his murder. He presented the letter to the family patriarch and was given a sum of money to keep silent about the dirty business. Farlond Piiradost was quickly sent away to live with lesser-ranked relatives in [[Iriaebor]] and the coverup was apparently successful. Hemmerem's discretion led to other work for the noble family, including jobs on the horse-breeding side.

By the late 1490s DR,{{HAT-time}} Porb Piiradost was known as one of the richest people of Waterdeep. At that time, Porb went to [[Neverwinter]] to bet big on the [[High Sun Games]], which had been revived by Lord [[Forge Fitzwilliam]], and brought his riches with them. Ultimately, however, Porb was slain and turned into a [[zombie]] and his riches were stolen and lost.{{Cite web/D&D Beyond/Legendary Magic Items}}
