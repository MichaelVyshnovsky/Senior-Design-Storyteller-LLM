Tu Lung
The Sung were a ninja clan in Laothan in Malatra in the mid–14 century DR.
They acted as spies and assassins for anyone with the coin to hire them. They were not involved in politics and were not supporters of Prince Nuyen Phi, ruler of Sayan. They cared only that they could move freely across the land to ply their dark trade. They were the most active such group in the realm.
The Sung operated all across Laothan, but remained based in the seaport city of Sayan.
They would even conduct their espionage in the neighboring Kuong Kingdom, where they often posed as merchants.
Of Shou heritage, they originated in Tu Lung, but established themselves in Sayan in Laothan.
