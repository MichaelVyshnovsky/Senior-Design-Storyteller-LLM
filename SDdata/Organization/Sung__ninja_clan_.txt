The '''Sung''' were a [[ninja]] clan in [[Laothan]] in [[Malatra]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
They acted as spies and assassins for anyone with the coin to hire them. They were not involved in politics and were not supporters of Prince [[Nuyen Phi]], ruler of Sayan. They cared only that they could move freely across the land to ply their dark trade. They were the most active such group in the realm.

==Base of Operations==
The Sung operated all across Laothan, but remained based in the seaport city of [[Sayan]].

They would even conduct their espionage in the neighboring [[Kuong Kingdom]], where they often posed as merchants.

==History==
Of [[Shou]] heritage, they originated in [[T'u Lung]], but established themselves in Sayan in Laothan.
