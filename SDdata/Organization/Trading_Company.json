        "mainbody": "'''The Trading Company''' was an organization of mercenaries and arms dealers active in the city of [[Bral]].",
        "Organization": "During the reign of Prince [[Andru]], the Senior Agent for the branch of the Company in Bral was [[Talosa Baniasan]], but he preferred to allow the veteran soldiers to run the training and recruitment of the organization, instead handling the matters of their weapon's inventory and trade.",
        "Activities": "The Company refused to take political sides, working for whoever paid them but never for multiple sides of a conflict at the same time.\n\nIf a war were to break out in [[Realmspace]], they would begin a massive recruiting drive and begin purchasing more weapons and ships.",
        "Holdings": "The Trading Company owned a small number of [[Spelljammer|spelljamming vessels]], but it preferred to rent ships when needed. They did, however, maintain a large warehouse for stockpiling weapons,",
        "Members": "Only a small group of veteran mercenaries were permanent members of the Company. These were mostly [[human]] [[fighter]]s, but the group had no racial requirements. Most were armed in [[chainmail]], with [[halberd]]s and [[light crossbow]]s. About a quarter were highly skilled in a particular weapon."
