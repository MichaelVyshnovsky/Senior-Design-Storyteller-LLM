        "mainbody": "The '''Risen Sun heresy''' was the belief that the time of [[Lathander]]'s transformation was nigh and [[Amaunator]] was about to return. The [[Brotherhood of the Glorious Sun]] has long existed within the church of Lathander, tolerated by other followers of the Morninglord and preaching that Lathander was the reincarnated form of Amaunator. Believers of the Risen Sun take this one step further into heresy.\n\nSunlord [[Daelegoth Orndeir]], the leader of the Brotherhood, has embraced the Risen Sun heresy and since [[1374 DR]] has sought to make it the core belief system of those faithful to Lathander. He has accomplished this by recruiting converts to the faith of Amaunator through preaching and performing miracles.\n\nRisen Sun heretics have access to the [[Fire domain|Fire]], [[Law domain|Law]], [[Nobility domain|Nobility]], [[Renewal domain|Renewal]], [[Sun domain|Sun]], and [[Time domain|Time]] spell domains. Their [[favored weapon]] was the [[light mace]]. On casting, ''[[weapon of the deity]]'', their light mace turned into a ''[[flaming]] light mace''.\n\nThose who subscribed to this philosophy were capable of becoming [[sunmaster]]s."
