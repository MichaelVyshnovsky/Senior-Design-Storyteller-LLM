The Silver Strike Guild was an organization that professed to fight for species equality, specifically of those species often used as mounts despite being (or mistaken to be) sapient.
The Silver Strike Guilds primary goal was the dismantling of the trade in various sentient air-creatures, such as giant eagles, giant owls, among other animals.
To raise money to support their idealistic activities, they offered a variety of services ranging from deliveries, to bodyguard-work, to bounty hunting.
The Silver Strike Guilds main guildhall was located in the city of Blurophil on the Elemental Plane of Air.
The leaders and founders of the Silver Strike Guild were the half-air elemental, half-human Hasken Maeke and the pegasus Bolt. The leaders-in-training were Haskens sons and Streak, the son of Bolt (Bolt was the father, grandfather, or great-grandfather of most of the pegasi in the guild).
