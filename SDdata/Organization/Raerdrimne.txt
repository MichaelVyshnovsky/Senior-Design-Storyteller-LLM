House '''Raerdrimne''' was a [[sun elf]] house known for producing fine [[ceramic]]s, [[jewelry]], paintings, and statues.

==Home==
The house estate was a structure in [[Leuthilspar]] in a shaded grove of trees.

==History==
Members of House Raerdrimne once helped to repel a [[goblin]] invasion.

Only twenty of its members made it to [[Evermeet]] during the [[Retreat]]. As of [[1368 DR]], no children had been born to members of the house in centuries. Most of its members were over 700 years old, meaning that unless the house produced offspring, it would cease to exist in a matter of centuries.
