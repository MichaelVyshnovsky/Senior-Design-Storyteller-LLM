The Lords Alliance, also known as the Council of Lords, was a partnership of merchant cities founded in the early 14 century DR. Its members were from the Sword Coast, the North and Western Heartlands, including Waterdeep, Silverymoon, Baldurs Gate, and Neverwinter, as well as other free cities and towns in the region, which made up the bulk of the organization. rampaging hordes of orcs, and Northlander raiders.
Depending on who was asked, the Lords Alliance was considered either a strong coalition, others insisted they were among the most secure governing bodies in the west. The true strength of the alliance, it was said, manifested when its members banded together on collaborative endeavors. 
While some of these cities and city-states held more influence than others, they aligned their goals for the greater good and prosperity of the whole alliance. Collectively they believed in the preservation of civilization for the better of their people.
The alliances emblem was a golden crown set over a field of red.

Member-states of the Lords Alliance served to better the collective regions of the North and the Western Heartlands as a whole. They achieved this through well-wrought mercantile treaties and official pledges to ensure their collective safety, especially along prominent trade routes. The collective group bargained with foreign trading partners and even regulated preferred relations and treatment of certain groups long-feared by many people of the Coast and the North, such as goblinoids and orc tribes. 
The alliance often took charge whenever it was necessary to take military action in campaigns that arose across the North or the Heartlands.
The Lords Alliance also maintained the prison of Revels End, an isolated panopticon in the Frozenfar that housed some of most heinous criminals from across the North and Sword Coast.
The alliance usually hired adventurers to work for them in the past for tasks ranging from gathering simple information, or even for use in raids against Zhentarim strongholds and outposts. Local adventurers could quickly gain status, as well as powerful friends by helping the alliance, but can just as easily make enemies of the sinister Zhentarim as a result.

Around that same time, members of the Alliance took note of strange goings-on in the regions of the Underdark beneath the North and the Sword Coast.
