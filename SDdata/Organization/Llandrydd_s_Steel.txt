Llandrydds Steel was a mercenary company based in Vilhon Reach and active also in the Sea of Fallen Stars around 1358 DR.
They were divided into two units the Steel, 150 fighters led by Llandrydd and the Auxiliary, 80 pike wielders.
In battle, the Steel often wrapped around the Auxiliary.
The Company preferred time periods–specific jobs if the time expired but the job was not finished, they asked to renegotiate or they left. They normally charged 500 gold pieces per day for their services, half in advance.
The Llandrydd were founded by Llandrydd Wyvernheart, a recruiter who decided to form a standing company after an extended period of action. They were decisive in the battle against the arcanaloth Yrkhetep.
