The '''Order of Cryptic Transformational Purity''' was an order of [[mystic]]s who worshiped [[Istishia]], the Water Lord.

==Organization==
The Order of Cryptic Transformational Purity chose for their symbol a [[human]] transforming into a [[fish]]. Since their symbol resembled a [[merman]], members of this order were often simply referred to as "fishtishians" or the Water Lord's fishmen.
