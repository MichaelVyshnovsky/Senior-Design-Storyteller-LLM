The Teeth were an evil ogre mercenary company based in the Stonelands in the 14 century DR.
The Teeth were led by the infamous ogre Jadron the Fang. They were typically organized in units of 19 warriors led by a sergeant who reported to Jadron, deployed separately or combined together into a large force. Ogre recruits went through a tough initiation, including filing their teeth down to sharp points. Members could not leave the company, with death being the only way out.
The Teeth charged 2 gold pieces per week for each warrior hired to perform heinous deeds.
The Teeth preferred quick and decisive combat, attacking from different directions at the same time instil confusion and terror. They were fond of biting the enemies in combat with their sharpened teeth, and it was a key sign of their presence on the battlefield.
The Teeth were based in the Stonelands, and operated into nearby regions including the Goblin Marches and the Dalelands.
Jadron and the Teeth earned many enemies from their brutal actions and gained no allies. In particular, they earned the eternal enmity of Nightshade, leader of the Evereskan Silent Rain company.
In 1375 DR, the Teeth were hired by the Zhentarim to assist in the conquest and occupation of Shadowdale. A squad of five ogre warriors led by Rarnok Jadronson attacked and destroyed the tiny village of Oakwood Knoll alongside Skull and Club mercenaries, losing two of their number to the determined defense of the locals. As the two mercenary groups argued and almost came to blows over the spoils, a group of adventurers traveling to Shadowdale may have overcome them and saved the remaining villagers.
