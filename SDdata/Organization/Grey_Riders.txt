The Grey Riders (also Gray Riders) were a group of around twenty rangers on horseback who were protectors of Harrowdale in the Dalelands. Their primary purpose as of 1368 DR was to guard against monsters and bandits in the forests and woods of the dale.
By 1374 DR, the Council of Seven Burghers had recruited twelve Grey Riders to operate from Velartree.
In 1368 DR, the Grey Riders had no powers of arrest, and their duty was simply to watch for threats, and, if necessary, seek support from other dales. However, by 1374 DR, the Grey Riders had been granted the power of arrest, to keep prisoners, and to transport them to Harrowdale Town for "Council justice".
