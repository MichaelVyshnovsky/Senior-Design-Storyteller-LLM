Every member spent at least three hours, four times a tenday,As weeks do not exist in the Realms and the minimum does not change when tendays are used instead, it is rendered as tendays. improving the library, at least 26 times a year.\nWhile Candlekeep and the Leaves of Learning had bigger libraries with more volumes on truespeak, they were nowhere near as correctly catalogued and concentrated.\nThey worked out of a small building next to the House of the Four Moons.\nThe four study groups were led by Sarlisha Kjenth, Maaruel Vench, Nelinarian Tansmith, and Maerw√ªn Venedel. Other members included ten other humans, one other half-elf, and three gnomes."
