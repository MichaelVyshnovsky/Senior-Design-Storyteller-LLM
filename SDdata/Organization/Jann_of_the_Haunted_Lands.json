        "mainbody": "he Jann of the Haunted Lands was one of the largest and most powerful groups of jann in Zakhara in 1367 DR.\nCompared to jann found elsewhere in the Land of Fate, many of the Jann of the Haunted Lands were impulsive and vindictive genies. This behavior, combined with their great power, made them a particularly dangerous group. Raids against humans and other races were quite common. However, not all of the jann inhabiting the Haunted Lands behaved this way. Many were still allied with other races.\nAs a group, the Jann of the Haunted Lands pledged their allegiance to the current Grand Caliphs, fourteen predecessors. However, as of 1367 DR, no emissary had been sent from the jann to renew the support. This was largely believed to be in direct relation to the failing health of their leader, Amir Heidar Qan. The reality of the situation was far worseâ€”Heidar Qan had not been seen by anyone, jann or otherwise, for over 50 years resulting in the increased chaotic behavior of the Jann of the Haunted Lands.\nUp until 1317 DR, the Jann of the Haunted Lands were ruled by Amir Heidar Qan. His absence for the past 50 years has left matters within the jann community in disarray.\nLike other large groups of jann, the Jann of the Haunted Lands were grouped into smaller tribes ruled by sheikhs who, in turn, were led by an amir.\nThe large wasteland known as the Great Anvil within the vast expanse of the Haunted Lands was the home of these jann. Most intruders into the region were not welcomed kindly."
