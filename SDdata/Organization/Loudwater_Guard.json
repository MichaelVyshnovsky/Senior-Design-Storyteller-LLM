        "mainbody": "he Loudwater Guard was the militia of the city of Loudwater in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. They were also known as the Loudwater Riders.The Legacy of the Green Regent sources do not make it clear what the Loudwater Riders actually are. As its clear theyre not an adventuring company, nor related to any other faction, it is presumed they are a militia of Loudwater. For convenience, its assumed theyre a part of or the same as the better-known Loudwater Guard.\nIt comprised 300 soldiers, typically divided into patrols of up to 20. Regular members, called guards, were proficient warriors, while the sergeants, titled fists, were capable fighters. They were aided by mages, namely evokers and sorcerers, and clerics, typically of Helm, the Red Knight, or Torm.\nThe militia was ultimately commanded by the two Gauntlets of Loudwater.\nA particular patrol was Thelbrimms Nine, also known as Thelbrimms Four. Serving under Gauntlet Thelbrimm, they were one of the units that patrolled and protected the eastern lands of Loudwaters domain.Given the contradictory and dubious rumors in which they are mentioned, its possible Thelbrimms Nine/Four does not actually exist.\nWarriors were equipped with chainmail, a wooden light shield, longsword, light crossbow, and bolts. They wore uniforms of electric-blue tabards emblazoned front and back with the citys three golden crescent moons, over dark-brown breeches and blouses.\nThe sergeants instead wore white tabards and were granted masterwork longswords and magical +1 chainmail and +1 wooden light shields, including alchemical silver bolts and potions of cure light wounds.\nTypically, when there was trouble in the city, the citizens called for the Loudwater Guard, who responded within a minute with a group of up to a dozen guards led by a fist, and possibly with a spellcaster.\nThe Loudwater Riders ranged further afield, as far as the Grey Highlands. They would use boats to cross the River Greyflow at Celdors Crossing.\nOccasionally, the Loudwater Riders needed to clear bandits or bugbears out of the ruined Phantoms Cloister in Southwood.\nWithin the city, the Loudwater Guard was divided by and based in a number of buildings known as armories. These didnt just store and supply weapons, but also served as police stations for maintaining order in their respective neighborhoods. Each armory was commanded by a fist captain, who had a staff of 3 to 5 fists, who each led patrols of 5 to 10 guards. One was the Geenfunt Armory, which was located in Funt Market at the end of Geenfunt Way, and had three fists.\nThe Gauntlet of the Eastern Marches had their headquarters in the Eastenhall\nIn the , a troop of Zhentarim and Zhentilar commanded by Vaalgamon invaded the main street of Loudwater to ambush the Heroes of Ascore, a band of adventurers carrying the magical statuettes of Ascore. With their manticores, they blocked the main street and patrolled side streets looking for them. However, for some reason, Lord Greysword dared not move openly against the Zhents. Making use of Loudwaters winding roads and side streets, the adventurers thinned the Zhents numbers and routed them, and the Loudwater Guard joined them for the final fight. However, Vaalgamon escaped and burned his headquarters as he left, causing much damage in the area and necessitating rebuilding. In the tendays afterward, one guardsman declared Vaalgamon had done it to prevent the Guard seizing his plans, lest they thwart the whole Zhentish invasion. The fellow boasted he had been in the frontline and nearly struck the Zhent commander before he escaped.\nDuring the Gray Migrations of the High Forest orcs in the , by the month of Eleasis a story was going around the Grayvale that Thelbrimms Nine had found five families in a homestead east of Orlbar massacred by orcs and their homes destroyed, and that the orcs had taken nothing and done it for kicks. Another version said it was Thelbrimms Four, that it was only two families killed but also all their animals, including the cats.\nIn late Eleasis, the Loudwater Riders reported seeing a red dragon near a place called Tangletrees.\n* Gauntlet of the Western Marches Kalahar Twohands\n* Gauntlet of the Eastern Marches Harazos Thelbrimm\n* Gauntlet of the Western Marches Jaida Zerezeal\n* Gauntlet of the Western Marches Isyan Kiysisnos.\n* Fist Captain Nesrin, commander of Geenfunt Armory\n* Fist Keshel, a senior sergeant of Geenfunt Armory\n* Fist Pennet Farhill\n* Fist Korath Hospler\n* Fist Barvas Naren\n* Fist Pevil Trollhammer, right hand of Gauntlet Thelbrimm"
