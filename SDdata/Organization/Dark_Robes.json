        "mainbody": "The Dark Robes were a secret guild of necromancers based in Baldurs Gate around 1372 DR.\nFormed because their deeds were illegal by Baldurian law, the Dark Robes gathered at nights in the catacombs under the city. Theyd renovated some of the subterranean crypts into laboratories in which they experimented with the undead.\nThey wore dark robes with deep hoods and went by code names to conceal their true identities even from each other. However, each was a respectable citizen during the day."
