        "mainbody": "The '''Midler''' family was a farming household that lived near the village of [[Eveningstar]] in [[Cormyr]] during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]], led by the family patriarch [[Ricnan Midler]]. They were joined there by the '''Chandler''' family, who had married into the Midlers.",
        "History": "During the [[Darkening]] and the [[Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar]] in the mid-1480s DR, the [[Midler farmhouse]] outside of Eveningstar was overtaken by the cruel priestess of [[Lolth]] [[Vicala Szind]]. Vicala's forces, including her pet [[spider]] [[Akorstra]] and Warleader [[Speitar Dun'Robar]], held the entire extended family hostage while interrogating them for clues as to the location of the [[Thread of the Weave]]. Their cook [[Maisby]] managed to evade detection and hid in the shed behind the house, waiting there for a full night and day before stealthily moving to Eveningstar to get help.\n\nIn response to the call for aid, two [[Purple Dragons]] including [[Vicben Arroway]] moved to investigate, only to be overcome by the [[drow]] invaders. A team of [[adventurer]]s were sent next, who found that Vicben and the whole Midler family had been magically linked to Vicala Szind, allowing her to drain their life force to replenish her own, and forcing the adventurers to handle the situation very carefully. While Vicben was slain, the rest of the Midler family may have been rescued safely without Vicala having the chance to sacrifice them as her shields.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, their servant Maisby moved on to hopefully calmer employment, only to become part of a [[vampire]] plot at [[Sable Manor]].{{DDO-time}}",
