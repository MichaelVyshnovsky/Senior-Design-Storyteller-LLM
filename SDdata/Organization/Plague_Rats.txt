The '''Plague Rats''' was the guild of top [[thief|thieves]], [[assassins]], and [[wererat]]s, bitter rivals of the [[Xanathar's Thieves' Guild]], operating throughout the [[Western Heartlands]], [[North Faerûn]].

==Activities==
The Plague Rats operated the temple of [[Talona]] in the [[Rat Hills]], called the [[Rat's Maw]]. The Maw was an underground complex, part of the guild's headquarters, and was a complex, entertaining system of tunnels, rooms, and warrens. The regular sacrifices to Talona by the Rats were humanoids and other creatures infected with a wide array of plagues and afflictions while keeping them alive and suffering on the temple's shrine.{{Cite web enhancement/Environs of Waterdeep|13}}

==Base of Operations==
The main headquarters of the Assassins' Guild was located somewhere deep within the [[Rat Hills]] and had a multitude of underground connections to [[Undermountain]] of [[Waterdeep]]. Its exact location was a fiercely guarded secret.

==Relationships==
Plague Rats served the goddess [[Talona]], the Mother of all Plagues, alongside a few other organizations consisted of thieves, rogues, or vermin.

Members of the [[Confluence]], aided by the [[church of Selûne]], closely monitored activities of Waterdeep's [[lycanthrope]]s. That included the Plague Rats.

Plague Rats were bitter rivals of the Xanathar's guild based in [[Skullport]]. The Rats' members often monitored the [[Xanathar's estate]] not missing an opportunity to shiv careless members of the Thieves' Guild or attempt to recruit their opponents.

==History==
The Plague Rats were reportedly unaffected by the [[Rat Hills Conflagration]] of [[1367 DR]].
