The Plague Rats was the guild of top thieves, assassins, and wererats, bitter rivals of the Xanathars Thieves Guild, operating throughout the Western Heartlands, North Faerûn.
The Plague Rats operated the temple of Talona in the Rat Hills, called the Rats Maw. The Maw was an underground complex, part of the guilds headquarters, and was a complex, entertaining system of tunnels, rooms, and warrens. The regular sacrifices to Talona by the Rats were humanoids and other creatures infected with a wide array of plagues and afflictions while keeping them alive and suffering on the temples shrine.
The main headquarters of the Assassins Guild was located somewhere deep within the Rat Hills and had a multitude of underground connections to Undermountain of Waterdeep. Its exact location was a fiercely guarded secret.
