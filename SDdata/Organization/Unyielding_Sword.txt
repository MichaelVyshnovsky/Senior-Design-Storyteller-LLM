The '''Unyielding Sword''' was a small mercenary company in [[Skullport]] in [[1379 DR]].[[Derek Myers]]. "Eyes on The Ball." ''[[Dungeon (magazine)|Dungeon]]'' #206. Renton, WA: Wizards of the Coast, September 2012.  

==Activities==
The Unyielding Sword often procured slaves for the slaver [[Lanador]].

==History==
In 1379 DR, Lanador hired Eldreth and his men to kidnap ten [[elves]] from [[Waterdeep]]'s streets. Unfortunately, unknown to them, one of them was one of the [[Agents of the Eye]]. So the [[Xanathar]] supported an adventuring party to enter the Lanador's lair. Many of the Unyielding Sword were there and were killed in the fighting.[[Derek Myers]]. "Eyes on The Ball."
