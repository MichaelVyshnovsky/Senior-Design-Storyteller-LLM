        "mainbody": "The Haifami were a tribe of humans who inhabited an area of Jazayir al-Sartan in southwest Zakhara.\nThe Chief only assembled a \"court\" when major decisions needed to be made.\nThe humans of the Haifami were aggressive and war-like. They were also rumored to be cannibals. Either a female sea mage or a special cleric called a kahin accompanied any expedition on the sea while fishing and searching for food. These spellcasters also accompanied military expeditions.\nSix small villages made up the Haifami tribe.\nChief Shafiya ruled the Haifami. He was the third son of the previous chief and rose to power through his impressive martial skill."
