The Lords of the Golden Hills was the collective name given to the gnome pantheon. It consisted of the gnomish gods that resided on the plane of the Golden Hills, as well as Urdlen.
The Lords of the Golden Hills were actively involved in the lives of the Forgotten Folk, but they dispatched their avatars on quests that indirectly benefited the gnomes, rather than regularly appearing before their worshipers.

Legends spoke of the existence of several goddesses in the gnomish pantheon, but their stories were long lost to history. There was a tradition among gnomish youth to claim divine inspiration to go in search of the Ladies of the Golden Hills, rather than admit that adventure was calling them to leave their close-knit gnomish families.
