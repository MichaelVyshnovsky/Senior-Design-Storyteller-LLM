The '''Lords of the Golden Hills''' was the collective name given to the [[gnome]] pantheon. It consisted of the gnomish [[god]]s that resided on the plane of the [[Golden Hills]], as well as [[Urdlen]].

{{Quote
|Who forged the chains that bind [[Tiamat]] in [[Avernus]]? Why do the [[modron]]s go on the [[Great Modron March|Great March]]? Who is the [[Lady of Pain]], really? I can't tell you, but the answer lies in the Golden Hills. And if Garl and his gang don't know, it can't be known.
|[[Griballix]], a gnome of [[Sigil]].

==Activities==
The Lords of the Golden Hills were actively involved in the lives of the Forgotten Folk, but they dispatched their avatars on quests that indirectly benefited the gnomes, rather than regularly appearing before their worshipers.

==Members==
*[[Garl Glittergold]], greater god of luck, humor, trickery, and gems; the leader of the gnomish pantheon.
*[[Baervan Wildwanderer]], intermediate god of nature, travel, and forests.
*[[Callarduran Smoothhands]], intermediate god of stone, mining, and the [[svirfneblin]].
*[[Flandal Steelskin]], intermediate god of smithing and metalworking.
*[[Segojan Earthcaller]], intermediate god of death, earth and nature (in the Underdark).
*[[Baravar Cloakshadow]], lesser god of illusion and deception.
*[[Gaerdal Ironhand]], lesser god of vigilance, defense, and combat.
*[[Nebelun]] the Meddler, god of invention, construction and luck; in the Realms an aspect of [[Gond]].
*[[Urdlen]], lesser god of bloodlust, evil, hatred, and destruction.

==Rumors and Legends==
Legends spoke of the existence of several goddesses in the gnomish pantheon, but their stories were long lost to history. There was a tradition among gnomish youth to claim divine inspiration to go in search of the Ladies of the Golden Hills, rather than admit that adventure was calling them to leave their close-knit gnomish families.
