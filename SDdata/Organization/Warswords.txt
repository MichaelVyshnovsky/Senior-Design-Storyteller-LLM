The Warswords of Impiltur were a militia army that regularly patrolled the nation and defended the borders it shared with the eastern realms of Faerûn.
The Warswords often bolstered their numbers with groups of hired adventurers, called "swordpoints", who were granted additional freedoms when operating under the "Kings Code".
A typical Warsword patrol consisted of twenty mounted soldiers, clad in chainmail and armed with lances and crossbows.
