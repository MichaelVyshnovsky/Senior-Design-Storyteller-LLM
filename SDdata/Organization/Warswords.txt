The '''Warswords''' of [[Impiltur]] were a militia army that regularly patrolled the nation and defended the borders it shared with the [[Unapproachable East|eastern realms]] of [[Faer√ªn]].

==Activities==
The Warswords often bolstered their numbers with groups of hired adventurers, called "swordpoints", who were granted additional freedoms when operating under the ''"King's Code"''.

==Organization==
A typical Warsword patrol consisted of twenty mounted soldiers, clad in [[chainmail]] and armed with [[lance]]s and [[crossbow]]s.

==Notable Members==
* [[Haelimbrar]]: War-Captain and councilor of the [[Lords of Imphras II]]
* [[Simgar]]: Another member of the Council of Lords, Simgar spent much of his time leading Warsword expeditions{{Cite dragon/346/Impiltur: The Forgotten Kingdom}}
