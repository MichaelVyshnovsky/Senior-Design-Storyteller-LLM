The Stalwart Lions were a party of adventurers from Faer√ªn. After they retired, they founded Crosswinds Keep.
All the members had an equal vote on the matters of the keep.
The members of the Lions remained in Crosswinds Keep, and contributed to its defenses.
The members met when Bran Oakenshire was 24 years old, in a tavern near the docks of Waterdeep. At that time, Syussa Broar was on the run from a bounty hunter of Cormyr, and Elthure Vildenof had turned his back on the Red Wizards of Thay. They initially struck out for Myth Drannor, and while they barely escaped with their lives, they continued to adventure together, eventually becoming regarded as protectors of the heartlands.
The Stalwart Lions founded Crosswinds Keep after one of their members, Bran Oakenshire, proposed to Moala Adrell due to the disparity in their lifespans, Bran being a human and Moala an elf, they decided to settle down in the Astral Plane after she was given the mission by Chauntea through a vision.
