        "mainbody": "The Cymrych dynasty was a noble family who were High Kings and Queens of the Moonshae Isles, named for their legendary ancestor Cymrych Hugh.\nThe family possessed two symbols of office the Crown of the High King and the Sword of Cymrych Hugh.\nOriginally known as the Hugh family, the Cymrychs traced their lineage to Talfir nobility from Ebenfar who immigrated to the Moonshaes in the 2 century DR. Their ancestor, Callidyrr Hugh, became King of Corwell in the , after quelling a six-year civil war between the Ffolk that had sparked following the end of the First Dynasty of the Moonshaes.\nCallidyrrs son and successor was the legendary hero Cymrych Hugh, who defeated Kazgoroth in the , and was swiftly declared to be the first High King of the Ffolk. His first son, Warren I, would change the family name to Cymrych and become the first Cymrych monarch in the , although his rule would see a collapse of unity between the Ffolk as well as the arrival of the Northmen to the Isles.\nBeginning at this time, all of the various royal families of the Moonshaes began to adopt the Cymrych name, generally by changing their surnames whenever a Cymrych son or daughter married into their families. Within a few generations, virtually all Ffolk dynasties were Cymrych dynasties.\nThe first of the Cymrych High Kings were not seen as strong leaders, leading their vassal kingdoms to squabble and disobey them. However, in the late 3 century DR, High King Gwylloch and his son Ketheryll would not only be highly successful in their wars against the Northmen, but would also bring the recalcitrant Ffolk kings to heel, especially on the isle of Gwynneth.\nThe family would hold the office of High King for seven centuries before the loss of their symbols of office caused their authority to collapse. \nAt the same time that the family changed its name to \"Carrathal\", the many other Cymrych royal families likewise began to change the spelling and pronunciation of their names. This led to the distinct identities of the families of Cambridge, Cyric, Kendrick, Kimball, Kincaid, Riker, and Selkirk.\n* Callidyrr Hugh (161-193 DR), the first monarch in the family lineage.\n* Cymrych Hugh (171-250 DR), a legendary Ffolk hero, the first High King of the Moonshaes, and the namesake of the Cymrych dynasty.\n* Warren Cymrych I (237-259 DR), the who changed the family name from Hugh to Cymrych and ruled as the first Cymrych monarch. \n* Gwylloch Cymrych (265-299 DR) and his son, Ketheryll, who were infamous for building the Castle of Skulls.\n* Kemble Cymrych (400-482 DR), who welcomed Tethyrian settlers to the Isles, prompting great cultural change.\n* Dolan Cymrych (821-852 DR), whose defeat by the Northmen marked the loss of the Crown of the High King and would begin the decline of the Cymrych High Kings.\n* Tanner Cymrych (879-944 DR), whose defeat by firbolgs and loss of the Sword of Cymrych Hugh marked the end of Cymrych authority as rulers over all of the Ffolk.\n* Niall Carrathal (901-954 DR), who changed the family name from Cymrych to Carrathal to mark its transition from ruling the Ffolk to ruling only the Kingdom of Callidyrr."
