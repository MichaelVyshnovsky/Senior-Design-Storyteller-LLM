The Mtair Dhafir was a nomadic tribe of the Bedine people that traveled between the oases of the Sword in the Anauroch desert.
Like other tribes of the Bedine, the Mtair Dhafir were led by a single sheikh. As of the early 1360s DR, the Mtair Dhafir were led by Sheikh Sabkhat.
The Mtair were known to stay at the oasis of El Mara, among others.
In the , the Mtair Dhafir formed an alliance with the Qahtan tribe,
Mere days later, Sheikh Sabkhat entered into negotiations with the impressive warrior Zarud, an agent of the Zhentarim that sought to subjugate the Bedine and open a trade route through their lands. Unbeknownst to the sheikh, he was being manipulated by the spellcaster Yhekal and forced to act against his will. Thanks to the efforts of Ruha talking sense into her father, the insight of the brave warrior AlAif, and the intervention by the outlander agent of the Harpers known as Lander, the Mtair were able to eliminate Zarud, and avoid entering into an alliance with the Zhentarim.
Unfortunately the Zhentarim army and their asabi mercenaries quickly marched upon the Mtair camp at El Mara. The tribe was all but eradicated by the invading forces, and their bodies were fed to the reptilian asabis.
* AlAif, the tribes most fearsome warrior.
* Nata, its most mighty tribesman.
* Ruha, the exiled spellcaster who guided her people away from subjugation.
