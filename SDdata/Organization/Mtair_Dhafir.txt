The '''Mtair Dhafir''' was a nomadic tribe of the [[Bedine]] people that traveled between the oases of [[the Sword]] in the [[Anauroch]] desert.

==Organization==
Like other tribes of the Bedine, the Mtair Dhafir were led by a single sheikh. As of the early 1360s [[DR]], the Mtair Dhafir were led by Sheikh [[Sabkhat]].

==Base of Operations==
The Mtair were known to stay at the oasis of [[El Ma'ra]], among others.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1360}}, the Mtair Dhafir formed an alliance with the [[Qahtan]] tribe,

Mere days later, Sheikh Sabkhat entered into negotiations with the impressive warrior [[Zarud]], an agent of the [[Zhentarim]] that sought to subjugate the Bedine and open a trade route through their lands. Unbeknownst to the sheikh, he was being manipulated by the [[spellcaster]] [[Yhekal]] and forced to act against his will. Thanks to the efforts of Ruha talking sense into her father, the insight of the brave warrior [[Al'Aif]], and the intervention by the outlander agent of the [[Harpers]] known as [[Lander]], the Mtair were able to eliminate Zarud, and avoid entering into an alliance with the Zhentarim.

Unfortunately the Zhentarim army and their [[asabi]] mercenaries quickly marched upon the Mtair camp at El Ma'ra. The tribe was all but eradicated by the invading forces, and their bodies were fed to the reptilian asabis.

==Notable Members==
* [[Al'Aif]], the tribe's most fearsome warrior.
* [[Nata]], its most mighty tribesman.
* [[Ruha]], the exiled spellcaster who guided her people away from subjugation.<ref name=HL-p106">
