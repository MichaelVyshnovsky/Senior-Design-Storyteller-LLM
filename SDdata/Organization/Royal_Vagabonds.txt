The '''Royal Vagabonds''' was a secret [[Shou Lung]] spy agency.

==Description==
The Royal Vagabonds were a secret clan in service to the Shou Emperor. All members of the clan were [[ninja]]. They were not an official part of the government but still reported to the [[Minister of State Security]] and the [[Chief Imperial Censor]]. They did most of the difficult missions that the Emperor ordered. Nobody outside the clan could positively identify a vagabond. The only positive means of identification was a magical sigil borne on the chest of each man.
