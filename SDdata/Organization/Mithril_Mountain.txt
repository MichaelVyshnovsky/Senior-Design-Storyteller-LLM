The Mithril Mountain, or the Crescent, was a military organization within the Sevenfold Mazework of the Great Dismal Delve.
Three thousand light infantry archers made up the Mithril Mountain.
Recruited from the households of noble dao atamen and hetamen, the Mithril Mountain was not the most reliable combat unit.
The Sevenfold Mazework within the Great Dismal Delve served as base of all dao military organizations.
