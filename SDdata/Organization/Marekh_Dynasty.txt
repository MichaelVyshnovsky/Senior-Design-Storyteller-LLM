The Marekh Dynasty was the last of the twelve dynasties of the First Age of Calimshan, though it was the first of that nations many dynasties whose name is remembered by history.
The leaders of the Marekh Dynasty were bakkals, or high priests, of their people.
The rulers of this dynasty were relatively peaceful, with the exception of a few skirmishes with the dwarves of Shanatar.
The bakkals palace was located in the city of Calimport.
* Daud el Marekh, a ship captain and the final bakkal of the dynasty.
This dynasty began during an era of some 1300 years of peace following the unification of Coramshan and Mir into the nation of Calimshan by the warlord Ukhar IV.
Like many of the dozen dynasties of this age, the Marekhs faced the threat of plagues, which many modern Calishite scholars believed were created intentionally by the Jhaamdathan Empire.The Grand History of the Realms claims that this plague and the devastation of the Marekh dynasty occurred circa , but this is an error, a result of merging the entries for &minus4770 and  in the timeline provided on p. 14 of the Calimport sourcebook. The heir, Daud yn Khadil el Marekh, survived the plague and ruled, but he could not do so from decimated Calimport, as people feared living there again. When his reign of twelve years ended, so did his dynasty and the First Age.
It would not be until , nearly a century later, that a bakkal would rule in Calimport again. That bakkal was the first member of the Pahlemn Dynasty and ushered in Calimshans Second Age.
One of the sabbans in the city of Calimport was named after this dynasty, Marekh Sabban in Emerald Ward.
