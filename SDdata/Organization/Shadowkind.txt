The '''Shadowkind''' were an [[assassins]] [[guild]] based in the city of [[Procampur]] in [[the Vast]] in the 1360s [[DR]].

==History==
In [[1369 DR|the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR]], [[Calispar Delgorth]], a [[Talona]]n priest and member of the [[Vipers]] bandits, contacted the Shadowkind and offered them his magic-resistant poison. In exchange, he desired the deaths of a few of his enemies in Procampur, including the [[Pallar the Obedient|high priest of Torm]]. The Shadowkind accepted on the condition of proof of the poison's magic immunity. Calispar accepted and organized a demonstration in the nearby [[hamlet]] of [[Sevenecho (hamlet)|Sevenecho]]. A representative of the Shadowkind, [[Autton Shadowshroud]], was sent to oversee the test. 

==Organization==
The Shadowkind were a small but elite guild of assassins.
