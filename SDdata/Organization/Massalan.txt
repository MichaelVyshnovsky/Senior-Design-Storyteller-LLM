==Organization==
Lord [[Iliaru Massalan]] was the patriarch of the family from at least the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, to at least the {{YearlinkName|1372}}. He had no consort and the heir to the family title was his eldest nephew, [[Phorol Massalan|Phorol]]. As of 1372 DR, there were fifty-two living members of this noble family.

==Activities==
The Massalans were fine jewelers and dealt with gems and jewelry, serving those with the means to buy their wares.

==Base of Operations==
[[File:Lanngolyn-Messalan-Villas-1372.png|thumb|right|270px|''The Massalan family villa (labeled <code>N14</code>) ''circa'' 1372 DR.'']]
The [[Massalan Villa]] was prominently located on the northeast corner of the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]] and [[Delzorin Street]] in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]]. It consisted of a few unique one- and two-story buildings in a walled compound, with the main manor facing the [[Lanngolyn]] villa across Delzorin Street.

==Members==
* [[Iliaru Massalan]]: Patriarch in the mid–14{{th}} century.
* [[Phorol Massalan]]: Eldest nephew and heir of Iliaru.
* [[Khalamdar Massalan]]: Nicknamed "Nethercoats", implicated in the [[Traitor's Mill]] incident and disappeared.{{Cite web/Forging the Realms/The Traitors' Mill}}

==Rumors & Legends==
Phorol Massalan was known to be wooing a popular socialite named [[Ophyl Ramstel]], but she refused his marriage proposal and also a suit from a wealthy merchant, [[Vulphor Stralmaer]]. Sometime after these rejections, her beauty was horrifically marred by [[curse]]s, [[potion]]s, [[Acid|caustic agents]], or some combination of all three. In revenge for her loss of beauty and status, she published a small [[chapbook]] entitled ''[[What I Saw and Felt]]'', a tell-all exposé of her observations and exploits at various nobles' fetes and dinners in the past year. Many of the named noble families decried its inaccuracy and pressed Lord [[Piergeiron the Paladinson|Piergeiron]] to seize all copies of the book and punish the author with exile, whipping, or worse. Phorol denied there was ever any romance between himself and the courtesan.{{Cite web/Waterdeep News/Controversial Book Published}}

A young scion of the family, Khalamdar "Nethercoats" Massalan, was reportedly in cahoots with [[Hetheko Nesher]], [[Darrask Phull]], and [[Melthro Snome]] (all young members of the nobility) in a scheme involving weapon smuggling and building their own private armies using a mill on the [[River Dessarin|Dessarin River]] sometime in the late 1470s DR. The [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]] got wind of the scheme and investigated, only to be slaughtered by the mill "staff". One officer managed to escape with her life and report back to the leadership. After several failed attempts at neutralizing the well-armed and well-guarded mill, the Waterdhavian forces were eventually victorious and the four noble conspirators were exposed. The families all denied any involvement and blamed the overseer that had been hired to run the mill. The [[Lords of Waterdeep]] knew better and labeled the four men traitors. All four disappeared from the city, perhaps to begin anew in [[Baldur's Gate]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1480}}, the [[Vraunt of the Masked Princess]] revealed that Lady Dereira Massalan had received undocumented loans from at least four of the city's treasury officials (presumably by seducing them) and used the funds to buy investment properties in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]], making tidy profits upon resale.
