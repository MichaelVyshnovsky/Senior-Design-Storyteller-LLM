        "mainbody": "The Church of Garagos was a collection of clerics, crusaders, shamans, and specialty priests called bloodreavers devoted to Garagos, the Reaver. Collectively, Garagos worshipers were dubbed the Garagathans. \nThe faithful of Garagos were organized into individual churches that had their own hierarchies. Rivalries were common among those within close proximity to each other. \nThe oldest church was found in Westgate and suffered splits into warring cults. Garagos claiming and rebuilding a new temple in Gosra in Chondath during the Spellplague spurred all of the other churches to send representatives to the new location. \nGaragos shamans were found outside of the organized churches where berserker raiding was practiced.\nTitles among the faithful included Bloodbrother, Bloodsister, Supplicat, Priest/Priestess of the Blood, Reaver Lord/Lady, and Favored. \nFollowers of Garagos sought battle to help spread strife and satiate their bloodlust. Garagathans were forbidden to act against the churches of Shar, but also could not be an ally. \nSeven or more Garagathans could host a Blood Festival, celebrating Garagos and consuming part of their meal bloody and undercooked. Also occurring during a Blood Festival was the Full Blood–an initiation of a novice priest into the priesthood where they painted their faces with the blood of a dangerous creature that they slew alone. \nThe strongest collection of Garagos faithful as of 1368 DR was within the Vale of the Reaver north of Ankhapur. Ounadar the Blood-Drenched gathered a large host of brigands and berserkers to his camp. Another Garagathan site was Godswalk Keep, where an avatar of Garagos sometimes appeared. \nGaragathans believed peace was for the weak. War and battle made them strong, particularly in head to head clashes. A warriors word was their bond and your shield companion was your most trusted ally. They were expected to challenge, and defeat, a foe greater than themselves on a yearly basis. \nThe crusaders of Garagos were grouped into the Brothers of Blood whose sole mission was to destroy the Enemies of Garagos, most often followers of Tempus, wherever they could find them.\nThe Church of Garagos, then known as the Church of Targus, was acknowledged as the top military religious site of the Netherese. The Reavers faith was also widespread in Jhaamdath and throughout the Inner Sea. The largest Netherese temple was the Temple of Targus in the martial style Netherese enclave Akintaer.\nUnknown when, after the fall of Netheril with Karsuss Folly, the Church was renamed the Church of Garagos and became eternal foes with the Church of Tempus because an unknown conflict sparked by their gods, Tempus and Garagos.\nThe House of Steel, the oldest temple of Garagos and the site of the Reavers religion in Westgate, rose to prominence with the crowning of Gostaraj. After his death in 927 DR, the Templeban Edict issued by Altarl Campion forced all religious temples outside the streets of the city. The House of Steel forcefully became a subterranean temple and cult to Garagos ever since.\nThe Reaver rampaged throughout Westgate before leaving for the sea with a blood red water following him afterwards in 1358 DR during the Time of Troubles, indirectly further alienating the Church from the populous, thriving city. He foe Tempus appeared in Battledale of the Dalelands.\nIn the , various Garagathan temples had to innovate to reverse the decline of faith for their Church.\nBy the late 15th century DR, the underground temple House of Steel of the Church in Westgate had became abandoned for over a century. As of 1480 DR, it was commandeered as a lair by the vampire lord Kirenkirsalai of the Night Masks.\nDue to the God of War favored as Tempus in DR, the Church of Garagos had limited temples of worship and Garagathans by the 14th century DR. The membership further decreased with fewer temples by the late 15th century DR.\n* Favored High Reaver Chaless the Cruel, a Garagathan priestess who was head of the House of Steel subterranean temple of less than ten clergy in Westgate in 1368 DR.\n* Dynarth Bloodcowl, a Garagathan priest and brutal Westgate assassin of the Night Masks in 1370 DR.\n* Gostaraj the Reaver King, a mercenary lord and priest of the public House of Steel who ruled Westgate as King from 900 to 927 DR and launched a bloody rebellion to become King.\n* Ounadar the Blood-Drenched, a notable Garagathan priest who in 1368 DR operated in the Yondaths Vale of the Reaver, the largest center of Garagathan faith in the 14th century DR.\n* High Priest Santhro, a Garagathan warrior and innkeeper of Santhros Rooming House in Bezantur in 1368 DR who converted the Temple of Garagos of few followers into an inn to earn money for the Church.\n* Sunbright Steelshanks, a Rengarth barbarian warrior of circa −700 DR and owner of the greatsword, Harvester of Blood, during the age of Netheril."
