The Knights, relatively early into their careers, explored the legendary elven castle [[El'lahana Raikeil]] at the heart of the [[Moonwood]], overcoming its puzzles and riddles with whimsy and aplomb while an image of a silver unicorn shadowing them slowly solidified. By the end they found the lost [[Crown of Joy and Tears]] they had searched for and took turns placing it on their heads, each finding themselves cavorting with elves and unicorns along the banks of a silver stream, before returning it and leaving in search of new adventures.\n\nEnchanted by the sensibilities of the Knights, an avatar of Lurue manifested along with her [[Silver Herd]] outside the castle, who took the Knights on the ride of teir lives throughout the Moonwood. After this encounter the Knights took their legendary name and pledged themselves to Lurue (to some degree taking her as their mascot on a lark). Lurue favored their laughter and had gifted them ever since with wrongs to right and adventures without end. Over time more individiuals came to join the starting members, most of whom worshiped or at least revered Lurue, until going off on their own driven by wanderlust, individual motives and the original, whimsical nature of the Knights.\n\nDuring an expedition into [[Shilmista]] the Knights sighted Lurue's avatar again and gave chase as she led them on a merry ride for one enchanted evening before racing up a shaft of moonlight and vanishing. It was at this point the Knights made their solemn vow and immediately after reorganized. The senior knights created a loose collection of affiliated adventuring bands known as the [[Order of the Unicorn]]. The passing of time had seen what had once been adventures taken on for fun mature as the reality of danger, as well as Lurue's tenets, sunk in. With dedication to Lurue reaffirmed, each company wandered Faerûn \"chasing the unicorn\", righting wrongs and spreading the tale of the chase as they went. Companies of Knights ventured beyond the group's original scope, as far afield as [[Tethyr]], [[Cormyr]], [[Myth Drannor]], and [[Starmantle]], all while retaining their chivalric spirit.\n\nLurue was among the deities who looked favorably upon the [[Harpers]] and granted a divine boon to their [[harper agent|agents]] in the form of the ''[[speak with animals]]'' spell usable thrice a day.\n\nBeast cults revered Lurue simply as \"The Unicorn\".<ref name= \"CCIST\" />"

        "Activities": "Priestesses of Lurue spent their days helping visionaries achieve their dreams, providing aid and comfort to those in need and rescuing those in danger. Many were adventurers who traveled Faerun seekng wrongs to right, and balanced fun, self-improvement and gaining new experiences well.\n\nAlthough most of the clergy was periodically struck with wanderlust and few stuck to a single duty for long, they reliably saw specific, individual tasks through.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum\n| title      = Independence\n| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]], [[The Hooded One]]\n| topicid    = 10427\n| postid     = \n| whichpage  = 54\n| url        = http://candlekeep.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=10427&whichpage=54#234990\n| archiveurl = \n| date       = 2006-09-07\n| archivedate= \n| accessdate = 2023-07-26\n}} \n\nWhitehorn cults with Lurue as their patron worked primarily to safeguard and sequester unicorn glades, but they also helped recently ''[[awaken]]ed'' animals adjust.

The former was a night-long festival celebration of revelry, antics, and hullabaloo marked by wild rides through the countryside and sky, theatrical skits, humorous oratories, grand group songs, mock duels and romantic declarations. Many unicorns took a mate for life on this night. The latter by contrast was a quiet ceremony marking the onset of winter and served as a time for remembering those who have passed away and now \"dance with the unicorns.\" Many great works of art and epic song are unveiled at this time to quiet applause, particularly in Silverymoon, which celebrated its founding that day."

        "Base of Operations": {
            "Regions": "Lurue's worship is scattered throughout [[North Faerûn]] but she is favored in the [[High Forest]],{{Cite web/Player's Guide to Faerûn Errata|1-3}} and her namesake, the city of [[Silverymoon]], is the spiritual heart of her faith.",
            "Sites": "No temples specifically dedicated to Lurue existed; the goddess chose instead to be worshiped at sacred natural sites and holy groves, in whatever sylvan glades and moonlit glens unicorns deigned to tread. Representative of such holy sites were the banks of the [[Unicorn Run]], the river which winds through the southern reaches of the High Forest. There the unicorns are known to gambol, frolicking examples of woodland nature in its purest form. Common folk and [[bard]]s believe that certain deities, including Lurue, personally visit the river in animal guise, and so wise travelers are loath to harm or offend any creature, from slug to stag, that they meet \"along the Run.\"\n\nThe folk of Silverymoon believe that several benevolent deities, including Lurue, watch over their city, and almost all of them venerate her as the sacred protector of the city and all they hold dear about it. \n\nLurue had no specific shrine or glade within the city however; rather, every copse there is considered sacred to her, and according to legend her avatar had been spotted in nearly every coppice. Her priestesses within the city commonly worship  in [[Mielikki's Glade]] or the [[Silverglen]], but could be found throughout ministering to the less fortunate. These groves are the few remnants still considered holy ground to the city's sylvan powers.\n\nOther notable sites included:\n\n* The [[Helm and Cloak]], an inn in Baldur's Gate and established, informal headquarters of the Knights of the Unicorn. The Knights had been patrons of the Helm and Cloak long before those idealistic sons and daughters from patriar families became a real and renowned force of good in the world. A unicorn bust remaining in the common room as a testament to the origins of its former adventurer owners.\n\n* [[Phontyr's Unicorn]], a famous inn named for the ally, lifelong friend, and possibly love of the long-dead mage [[Phontyr Wonderspell]], that being a glowing, floating unicorn who some say is Lurue. Members of the Cult of the Unicorn boughed the inn to be near the unicorn and typically fell on their knees chanting with adoration when it was seen.\n\n* The [[Place of the Unicorn]], a grove sacred to Lurue in the hills northeast of [[Leilon]], where Lurue occasionally appears. The Place is only accessible at night, and [[wizard]]s of the [[Sword Coast]] believe that it lies in another dimension, reached only by a [[moongate]]. It consists of a bluegrass meadow which surround a stand of trees with brilliant blue leaves. Any who rest there are cured of all diseases, poisons, curses, and madness, and unicorns enjoyed the additional benefit of being healed of physical damage. Those without faith or of wavering beliefs often saw Lurue herself in the trees, and their reaction could reshape their lives.\n\n* [[Stone Stand]], a traditional [[Uthgardt]] ancestor mound used by the [[Blue Bear tribe]]. Rings of [[menhir]]s surround the heart of the mound, which predate the arrival of the Blue Bear tribe by centuries, and are inscribed with the symbols of various nature deities, including Lurue.{{Cite web/Mintiper's Chapbook/Part 8}}\n\nWithin the [[Hullack Forest]], immediately north of [[Stag]]'s Skull Bridge, was a clearing with a shrine to Mielikki. It was shared with worshippers of Lurue, but seldom used. A blue, eerie glow arose under certain conditions, including when the name of either goddess was uttered, or to surround any offering made to them, or to Silvanus or Eldath. Faithful of Lurue and Mielikki often slept through the night in the glade, lying on the bare ground (large, soft patches of moss were present), in hopes of receiving guidance from their goddess through dream-visions, which often meets with reward.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum\n| title      = Shrine\n| author     = [[Ed Greenwood]], [[The Hooded One]]\n| topicid    = 12023\n| postid     = \n| whichpage  = 5\n| url        = http://candlekeep.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=12023&whichpage=5#251020\n| archiveurl = \n| date       = 2009-01-17\n| archivedate= \n| accessdate = 2023-09-17\n}}"

        "History": "Silverymoon was founded on a place sacred to both Lurue and Mielikki since time immemorial, the reasons lost to time. Rather than trade, the site was used only as a place of religious pilgrimage after the fall of [[Netheril]] roughly a millennia ago and the resulting tumult. Within a century of a bridge at Silverymoon Ford, one of the few places where the River Rauvin was shallow enough to be forded in summer, being established, Gareth [[Ammakyl]] built [[Moonsilver Inn]] by the river's holy groves, the first permanent building on Lurue's holy lands. Eventually a cluster of log steadings was built there, forming the community of Moontree. Moontree became Silver Village, and then Silverymoon Town, developing slowly because its residents built in harmony with the forest rather than clearing and burning the land.  \n\nLegends claim that Mielikki and Lurue visited the Moonsilver Inn, disguised as a female ranger and her steed. They fell in love with the inn, the town's people and their sensitivity to the land that led them not to plunder but coexist. They were so taken with it all that they blessed the inn and all who would keep such goodness in their hearts. The building later collapsed, but its stones were used in making the city gates and walls, and the promise of safety bestowed by the blessing is thought to remain in effect and over the entire city and its people.\n\nSilverymoon became a city in [[637 DR]], when its first set of walls was completed and the first of the city’s ruling [[High Mages]], [[Ecamane Truesilver]], was elected. He, his nine apprentices, and successive High Mages have pursued the goal of fostering learning and culture in the city. Through the excitement of artistic endeavor and a feeling of refuge provided by various races harmoniously coexistig, they have sought to make Silverymoon \"the [[Myth Drannor]] of the North,” a bulwark of civilization in the [[Savage Frontier]]."
