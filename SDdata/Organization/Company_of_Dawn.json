        "History": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Thurbrand led the company on an ill-fated journey across Cormyr through [[Spiderhaunt Wood]] into [[Shadowdale]]. They were helping a friend of Thurbrand, [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]] and his companions [[Midnight]], [[Adon]], and [[Cyric]] evade authorities from Arabel and reach the dale safely. Nearly every member of the group was slain, save for Thurbrand, [[Isaac (mercenary)|Isaac]], and [[Vogt]].\n\nAfter the survivors of the expedition ensured the safe arrival of the adventurers at Shadowdale, they planned their return trip to Arabel.",
        "Members": "Members of the company included several young and inexperienced travelers, including the [[mage]] [[Bohaim]] of [[Suzail]], the naïve [[Tymora]]n thief [[Brion]], the teenager [[Gillian (Arabel)|Gillian]], along with Isaac, Vogt, [[Welch]], [[Zelanz]], and a cleric of [[Tymora]]."
