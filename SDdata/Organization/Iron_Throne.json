        "mainbody": "The '''Iron Throne''' was a mysterious mercantile organization that operated out of the [[Eastern Heartlands]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Though it controlled much of the weapons trade across the realms during its time,\n\nWhile it was a criminal organization in every sense of the word, the Iron Throne thrived in part because of the facade it projected to the rest of [[Faerûn]]: it was an honorable business that served the best interests of the realms. \n\n{{Quote|''\"We shall rule them from an Iron Throne, built of the weapons of our trade...\"''|[[Sfena]] in [[1347 DR]]}}",
        "Organization": "The leadership of the Iron Throne comprised the head of the organization and an inner circle of three advisors. These officers were each responsible for a different aspect of the Iron Throne's operations and mostly acted independently from one another.\n\n* '''The Arm''': This individual arranged mercantile contracts, organizes the routes they used for trade, and handled their smuggling rings. Smooth-talking negotiators and those with a mind for business were often recruited to serve the Arm. \n\n* '''The Foot''': This officer was responsible for protecting the organization's caravans and interfering with those belonging to other trading groups. All manner of sell-swords and criminals were hired to fight under their direction. \n\n* '''The Eye''': A single [[spellcaster]] acted as a [[magic]]al coordinator for the inner circle. They facilitated communication between members and gathered information by means of [[divination]]. Their agents included other spellcasters or those individuals with a strong network of informants.\n\nIn addition to their other subordinates, these individuals were each served by three lesser officers, who were more involved with day-to-day operations. The full scope of their collective activities was known only by the Iron Throne's leader and their inner circle.",
        "Activities": "[[File:Agent_of_the_Iron_Throne.png|thumb|right|275px|An agent of the Iron Throne engaging in what is undoubtedly shady behavior.]]\nOn the surface, the Iron Throne was invested in the trade in weapons in various areas throughout [[Faerûn]]. While they seemingly sought to form a monopoly of arms dealing, they in fact sought to parlay this martial strength into greater power and rule over the entirety of the [[Heartlands]].\n\nThey were known to cut out competition via unhanded tactics like banditry and murder.",
        "Tactics": "In order to maintain their public image, the Iron Throne's more malevolent activities were orchestrated in such a way that they could not be traced to the organization's leadership. To prevent dissension among the group's officers, they were each placed under the effects of the ''[[geas]]'' spell.\n\nAny member caught performing crimes or other wrongdoings were promptly disavowed by the Iron Throne. Anyone who slandered the group was met with public repudiation, they had their reputation brought into question, or were outright killed.",
        "Base of Operations": "As of the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Iron Throne maintained two headquarters in the [[Cormyr]]ean city of [[Suzail]] and another the Sembian capital of [[Selgaunt]]. \n\nThe organization operated throughout the entirety of the Heartlands, with other branches in [[Arabel]], and [[Baldur's Gate]].",
        "Possessions": "Members of the Iron Throne wore no common livery or overt identifying marks. High ranking officers carried a simple badge made of [[iron]], that bore their organization's symbol.",
        "Relationships": "As with any business the Iron Throne faced a number of competitors. Among these were the [[Merchant's League]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], the [[Firehands Group]] of [[Daerlun]],\n\nThe Iron Throne was often in conflict with the [[Zhentarim]], the [[Harpers]], and even the [[Rundeen]].",
        "History": {
            "Early Years": "The Iron Throne was founded by the [[fiend]]ish [[assassin]] [[Sfena]], in the {{YearlinkName|1347}}, in an effort to bargain away an affliction that beset her. The organization grew rapidly, quickly dominating the business of arms dealing and expanding into more generalized commerce.\n\nA decade after its formation, in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, the Iron Throne sent messages to all the various rulers and heads–of–state across the Eastern and [[Western Heartlands]]. They declared that their organization was to have complete control over the trade and sale of weapons throughout those vast regions. One such seizure of power happened thanks to an alliance with a wizard [[Cassana]] of [[Westgate]]. She lent the Iron Throne one of her summoned creatures called [[Kalmari]]. The creature singlehandedly burnt down the [[North Gate Inn]], interrupting the trade, and effectively handing the control of [[Shadow Gap]] to Iron Throne. As to be expected, this action upset many regional lords and other mercantile businesses.\n\nIn [[Marpenoth]] of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, the Cormyrean offices of the Iron Throne were closed and the coster was banned from conducting business within the kingdom for over one year. This action came by a royal decree from [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|King Azoun IV]] himself.",
            "Iron Crisis": "[[File:IronThroneHQ.png|thumb|right|300px|The Iron Throne's headquarters in [[Baldur's Gate]]]]\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the head of the Baldur's Gate branch of the Iron Throne, [[Richtar]] under the name of \"Reiltar Anchev\",\n\nIn a notable meeting that occurred that year, \"Reiltar\" and his associate [[Brunos Costak]] met with [[Tuth]] and [[Kestor]], agents that represented the [[Knights of the Shield]].\n\nUsing their hidden mine in the [[Cloak Wood]] forest, the Baldurian Iron Throne was going to dominate the trade of [[iron]], become the sole source of weaponry for Baldur's Gate, and emerge as a dominant political force within the region. Unfortunately, Sarevok actually cared little for the Iron Throne's plans and wanted to carry out the war and use that bloodshed to ascend as the god of murder. Both schemes were ultimately foiled by Sarevok's divine half-sibling and the Baldurian Iron Throne was left in near ruins.",
            "Downfall": "A few years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Sfena vanished off the face of [[Toril]], for reasons that were unknown all but one of her top officers. he offered up her whereabouts to her father, a powerful lord among the [[devil]]s.\n\nThe Iron Throne fell into disarray and lost its dominant hold over the arms trade. The group's upper echelon began to fight one another as they each sought leadership for their own. The Foot of the Iron Throne [[Krakosh]] was able stop the chaos by threat of force and became the organization's new leader. While the Iron Throne was did not face complete dissolution, it was severely weakened and its competitors were greatly bolstered.\n\nWhile the [[storm giant]] Krakosh was the head of the Iron Throne in name, he wanted nothing more than to locate rescue Sfena. While he used the organization to that end, Maready took charge the Iron Throne's daily operations.\n\nThe Baldur's Gate branch faced ruination in the {{YearlinkName|1374}}. The [[Council of Four]] hired the noble adventurer [[Dabron Sashenstar]] to dismantle the organization's hold within the city. The noble Sashenstar arrested Reiltar Anchev from his estate in Daerlun and revealed him to be [[Richtar|Richtar \"the Red Man\"]], the famed [[assassin]] who served the Arm of the Iron Throne.\n\nBy negotiating with Tuth of the Knights of the Shield, Dabron Sashenstar learned about the Iron Throne's origins and arranged to have [[Sfena]] brought to the domain of the Hidden Lord [[Gargauth]].<ref group=\"note\">While page 134 of [[Lords of Darkness]] states that devils \"return(ed) (Sfena) to [[Baator]]\" in [[1371 DR]], page 155 of [[The Grand History of the Realms]] states that \"Sfena (was) removed from the Realms\" in [[1374 DR]]. It is unknown if this is a discrepancy of it she returned to [[Toril]] during the intermittent 3 years. Shortly thereafter, the ''geas'' [[spell]]s affecting her former lieutenants begin to vanish away. In [[Tarsakh]] of [[1374 DR]], the remaining Iron Throne leaders meet in secret and arranged for the assassination of several representatives of the Merchant's League, the business of [[House Sashenstar]].\n\nThis final act of malevolence was all for naught however, as it they were themselves murdered by the Zhentarim. Word of these killings emerge in the month of [[Kythorn]]. After a failed assault on the Merchant's League headquarters in Arabel,"

        "Rumors & Legends": "Because so little was known about the Iron Throne's leaders, many speculated about their identities. Some believed them to be [[dwarven]] nobles that were removed for their seats of power or even a front for the nation of [[Thay]].\n\nYet other believed they were a splinter group of the [[Zhentarim]], servants of deity [[Cyric]], or serfs that were enthralled by [[beholder]]s and [[giant]]s that came from the sea."
