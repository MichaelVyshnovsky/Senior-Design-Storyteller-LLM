        "mainbody": "The '''Forgotten Lords''' was a large and prosperous trading cartel active across the [[Sword Coast]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n\n{{quote|''However, we do try to keep the economy of the region stable. We neither gouge nor undercharge during shortages - it's hardly beneficial to our long term business strategy.''|Aster Merris}}",
        "Organization": "The Forgotten Lords coster was run by [[Aster Merris]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]]. It was one of three major trade cartels granted offices within the [[Temple of Waukeen (Neverwinter)|Temple of Waukeen]] following the [[Shadow War]] in Neverwinter's [[Tyr's Eye]] district.\n\nThe coster encouraged new and aspiring merchant companies to join them, promising ethics, honesty, and access to numerous lucrative export deals across one largest region, including such valuable commodities as magical equipment. All those interested in joining had to pay a joining fee in [[trade bar]]s and membership fees that grew with advancement within the organization.",
        "History": "By the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, the Forgotten Lords were already a huge mercantile operation that stretched across the Sword Coast. Its regional leader was Aster Merris who was reassigned from the coster's headquarters in [[Waterdeep]] to [[Neverwinter]] after the Shadow War was over. Aster was considered to be canny and resourceful merchant favored by Waukeen. Aster's golden tough almost always guaranteed profit."
