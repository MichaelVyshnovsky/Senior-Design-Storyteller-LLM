        "mainbody": "he Caerilcarn (meaning the Council of the Wood) was a loose association of elf leaders in the High Forest that sought to rebuild the lost empire of Eaerlann.\nIt was led by a wood elf named Morgwais.\nWhile it never claimed to represent the beliefs of all elves in the High Forest and the Silver Marches, its end goal was to revive the lost elven realm of Eaerlann. In practice, it provided a forum for elven leaders in the High Forest to discuss issues of mutual concern and pass along news. It worked to revive Eaerlanni settlements and protect those that still existed.\nIt was formed sometime before 1374 DR.\nWhen orcs and daemonfey began to invade in 1374 DR, it was instrumental in evacuating wood elf villages in the path of the invaders, leading them to the Lost Peaks. There, with assistance from the Argent Legion, they were able to repel the attacks. At this point, the army of Evermeet began to occupy Myth Glaurach, putting them that much closer to their dream of a revived Eaerlann.\n* Teuveamanthaar, in the form of Tall Trees, resettled sometime at or before 1358 DR\n* Reitheillaethor, newly settled sometime before 1374 DR\n* Nordahaeril, newly settled sometime before 1374 DR\n* Morgwais, leader\n* Yrind Morninglight, leader/spokesperson of the faction that believes the existing clans and villages of wood and moon elves should be formally bound into a refounded Eaerlann."
