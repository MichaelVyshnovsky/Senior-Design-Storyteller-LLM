'''The Watch''' was a [[wemic]] fighting brigade from the land of [[Shaar]] in [[south Faerûn]], active some years before the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The Watch was a secretive organization consisting of [[warrior]] wemics that kept their goals hidden from the general public. However, it was known that the Watch was involved in extensive barter of [[weapon]]s exchanged for information. The organization's reputation led all locals and those from neighboring lands to fear and avoid the Watch. Sages believed that the fear was justified: in the area where the Watch was active, several [[human]] nomadic tribes disappeared during the organization's active years. By the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Watch's memory was preserved in a handful of [[enchanted]] [[shield]]s from the wemics' armories called the ''[[shields of the Watch]]'' that gained wide use in the [[northwest Faerûn]].
