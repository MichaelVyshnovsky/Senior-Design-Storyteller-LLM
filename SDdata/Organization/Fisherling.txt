'''Fisherlings''' were [[thieves]]&mdash;generally children&mdash;active in the [[Malar's Throat]] slums of [[Port Nyanzaru]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/A Walk in the Park|6}}

==Activities==
Fisherlings were so-named for their tactic of "fishing" for unsuspecting people's [[coin]] purses and other valuables from the high suspension bridges that spanned the Malar's Throat ravine. They were known to target individuals wearing unsecured items and [[satchel]]s that appeared to be carrying valuables. If spotted by their victims, they gleefully reeled in their lines and scattered into the slums, taking cover in the crowds.

==History==
The fisherlings were a well-known hazard of visiting Malar's Throat as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.
