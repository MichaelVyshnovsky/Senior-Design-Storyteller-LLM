'''House Fathomlin''' was a [[drow]] house with a long and tumultuous history and one of the ruling Houses of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the [[Northdark]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]],

==History==
House Fathomlin's history stretched back to before the [[Crown Wars|Third Crown War]]. Its last scion, ''circa'' {{Yearlink|-10500}}, was a [[dark elf]] [[wizard]] named [[Lyrna Fathomlin]] of [[Miyeritar]]. Lyrna resided in [[Myth Akherynnar]] in Miyeritar when the [[Dark Disaster]] ravaged her homeland, turning it into the desolate [[High Moor]] ''circa'' {{yearlink|-10500}}. After the failure of the [[Myriad Ritual]] to halt the Killing Storms, and the subsequent destruction of the city of [[Faer'tel'miir]],{{Cite dragon/373/Ecology of the Sharn|53-58}}

Despite that ancient tragedy, House Fathomlin survived and its dark elves became the drow of the [[Underdark]]. House Fathomlin rose to its [[Ruling Council]] status sometime after the {{YearlinkName|1358}} and before the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, when it sat as the [[List of drow houses|nineteenth House of Menzoberranza]]. However, it lost its status and was considered largely destroyed later in 1372 DR.
