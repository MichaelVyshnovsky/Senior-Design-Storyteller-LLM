The '''Bleeding Eye''' tribe was one of the [[orc]]ish tribes that inhabited the [[Spine of the World]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1281}}, the Bleeding Eye orcs were under the leadership of Chieftain [[Uligar]] and his ''[[wand of trap detection]]''. Several members of the tribe descended the Spine to raid caravans moving between [[Easthaven]] and [[Kuldahar]] with a [[goblin]] tribe. They were present at a ruined mill outside of Kuldahar during the [[Kuldahar Pass]] avalanche of 1281 DR.

By [[1370 DR]], orcish tribes of [[Skortchclaw]], [[Skreetch]], and Bleeding Eye took over [[dwarf|dwarvish]] fortresses on the Spine of the World, renamed by the new occupants to [[Fortress Eyegad|Eyegad]], [[Tame]], and [[Vokan]].
