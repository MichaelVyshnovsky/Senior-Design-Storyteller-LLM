The Bleeding Eye tribe was one of the orcish tribes that inhabited the Spine of the World in the 14 century DR.
In Eleint of the , the Bleeding Eye orcs were under the leadership of Chieftain Uligar and his wand of trap detection. Several members of the tribe descended the Spine to raid caravans moving between Easthaven and Kuldahar with a goblin tribe. They were present at a ruined mill outside of Kuldahar during the Kuldahar Pass avalanche of 1281 DR.
By 1370 DR, orcish tribes of Skortchclaw, Skreetch, and Bleeding Eye took over dwarvish fortresses on the Spine of the World, renamed by the new occupants to Eyegad, Tame, and Vokan.
