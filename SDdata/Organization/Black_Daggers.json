        "mainbody": "he Black Daggers were a pirate guild based in the Nelanther Isles in the Sea of Swords in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nOnly recently formed in the 1360s DR, the Black Daggers graciously declared that ships of Waterdeep were off-limits to its members, though this of course did not apply to non-members, so Waterdhavian vessels were only at reduced risk of attack around the Nelanther. Regardless, this amnesty was in thanks for Mirt the Merciless destroying the The Black Basilisk, a pirate-hunter from Luskan crewed by Hosttower mages, and scattering their Dead Fleet."
