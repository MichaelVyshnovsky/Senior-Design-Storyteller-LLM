The '''Rice Spirits''' were a group of [[Lesser Immortals]] of the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], the dominant faith of [[Kara-Tur]]. They served [[Nung Chiang]], the god of agriculture and fertility.

The Rice Spirits governed the harvest and fertility, and were responsible for causing rice to grow tall and sturdy, animals to have their young, and men and women to bear babies. They also decided if a family should have children. They could appear as women or men or as all manner of animals or magical beasts.
