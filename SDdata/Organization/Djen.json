        "mainbody": "The [[Djen]] was a large group of [[djinn]] and their slaves and servants led by the powerful djinni [[Calim]]. around {{Yearlink|-7800}} and settled the areas immediately surrounding present-day [[Calimport]]. This event was known as \"The [[Great Arrival]]\" and within mere months, they had built a large city, whose spires quickly rose above the trees.\n\nThey then proceeded to clear and seize all of the lands south and west of the [[Marching Mountains]] but unfortunately, after only 10 years, their city fell to a flight of dragons. Although with the genie's magic, the city was rebuilt within a year, the attack caused Calim to lead the Djen in a campaign against the dragons of the Marching Mountains. Within 100 years, all of the dragons in that mountain range were dead.\n\nThe [[Calim Empire|Djen empire]] lasted nearly two millennia with Calim at its head but its existence was fraught with war, first with [[marid]]s, then with [[efreet]] led by [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]]. The battles with the efreet were particularly destructive.\n\nEventually, tired of the senseless destruction, [[Elven High mage]]s disembodied Calim and Memnon, causing the creation of the [[Calim Desert]]. Afterward The [[human]] and [[halfling]] slaves and servants allied with the [[dwarves]] of [[Shanatar]] to drive the rest of the genies out of the area, creating the nation of [[Coramshan]].\n\nIt was the legacy of the Djen that so many [[genasi]] were to be found in the nation of [[Calimshan]] by the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]."
