'''Torlath''' was the ruling dynasty of [[Amn]] from the foundation of the realm in [[460 DR]] to [[1095 DR]].

==History==
The dynasty was founded in the {{YearlinkName|460}} by General [[Esmel Torlath I|Esmel]], who seized the [[Emirate of Amin]] following the rapid collapse of the [[Shoon Imperium]] in [[450 DR]]. Naming himself the King of Amn, he controlled the cities of [[Athkatla]], [[Murann]], and [[Crimmor]], with the realm extending to [[Lake Esmel]] in the east. His grandchildren [[Imnel Torlath I|Imnel]] and [[Amnur Torlath|Amnur]] proved capable and warlike men, and the royal line proceeded on with generally successful kings for centuries who expanded and enriched the realm.

The family faced a grave threat in the {{YearlinkName|696}}, however, when [[Arbas|Arbas the Usurper]] slew almost the entire royal family including King [[Esmel Torlath IV|Esmel IV]] and took the throne for himself. He was shortly after eliminated by the royal son [[Jhanos Torlath I|Jhanos]], who continued the much-winnowed family through a line of six "Wizard-Kings" who had long reigns, albeit disinterested ones that allowed the noble houses, merchant clans, and trade companies of the realm to gather increasingly large amounts of influence and power.

The Torlaths were finally obliterated between [[1094 DR]] and [[1095 DR]]. King [[Imnel Torlath IV|Imnel IV]] was slain by assassins, followed by King [[Niskam Torlath|Niskam the Doomed]], King [[Rhor Torlath|Rhor the Lackey]], and King [[Dornak Torlath|Dornak the Puppet King]] as the [[Braethar]] and [[Villax]] merchant houses attempted to control the throne. The Torlaths were wiped out, though the [[Wavegold]] family was able to claim a line of descent from the early royal Princess [[Jamyll Torlath|Jamyll]] and so took the throne for themselves in order to save the realm from a civil war.

The [[Tanislove]] family was actually a continuation from the Torlaths, though it was kept secret. The catastrophe of the [[Sothillisian War]] in [[1370 DR]] convinced [[Pehllus Tanislove]] that the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]] was hopelessly corrupt and ineffective, leading to a conspiracy with the [[Knights of the Shield]] that would see the monarchy restored through the Tanisloves.
