        "mainbody": "The '''Order of St. Uzurr''' was a monastic order that was devoted to [[Ilmater]] and followed [[Saint Uzurr]]. They were based at the [[Cloister of St. Uzurr]] in the city of [[Uzurr]] in [[Lapaliiya]].",
        "History": "Ilmatari missionaries of the Order of St. Uzurr traveled from [[Calimshan]] to Lapaliiya during the time of the [[Shoon Imperium]] ([[27 DR|27]]–[[450 DR]]). There they founded a walled monastery called the [[Cloister of St. Uzurr]]. In the following centuries, a city grew up around the monastery, known simply as \"Uzurr\", which the Order came to dominate. Both the Order and the city were led by the Abbot of St. Uzurr. ''Circa'' [[1373 DR]], this was Abbot [[Kadar al Ilmater]].\n\nUnfortunately, a member of the Order was a spy working for the [[yuan-ti]] [[House Eselemas]], who reported on Kadar's research into curing [[tainted one]]s and [[broodguard]]s. In response, [[yuan-ti pureblood]]s began infiltrating Uzurr on [[Eleasis 1|Eleasias 1]], the [[1373 DR|Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR]], with the aim of assassinating Kadar.<ref name=tGHotR-p153>",
        "Activities": "The Order worked to spread Ilmater's teachings across the [[Tashtan Coast]]. It cultivated, produced and exported olives, [[wine]]s, and assorted [[spices]] to support itself.",
