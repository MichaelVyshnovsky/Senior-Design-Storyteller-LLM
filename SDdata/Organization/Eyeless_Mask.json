        "Organization": "The majority of power within in the Eyeless Mask came from 14 extremely secretive [[Red Wizards]] of [[Thay]]. The remaining members were [[thieves]], priests of unknown faiths, and warriors.",
        "Activities": "Members of this group kidnapped spellcasters, priests, and nobility. They especially enjoyed preying on visitors to the city. The Red Wizards within the Eyeless Mask were after as much [[magic]] as they could get their hands on, believing that in doing so they would weaken the area for a future invasion from Thay.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Eyeless Mask held the most influence within the cities of [[Saerloon]] and [[Urmlaspyr]] in [[Sembia]]."
