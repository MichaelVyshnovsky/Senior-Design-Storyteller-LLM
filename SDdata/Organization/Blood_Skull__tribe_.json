        "mainbody": "The '''Blood Skulls''', also called the '''Bloody Skulls''' and previously the '''Black Spears''', were a powerful [[orc]] tribe in [[Thar]] from the late 14{{th}} through late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/361/Realmslore: The Tribes of Thar}}",
        "Base of Operations": "The Blood Skulls were based out of '''Bloodskull Keep''', a stronghold located in central Thar northwest of [[Bloodmuck]]. It was named in honor of the tribe's tradition of painting the skulls of fallen enemies and comrades red and mounting them in the keep's great hall. The collection was said to include hundreds of [[human]], [[dwarf]], and [[orc]] skulls, as well as prominently displayed [[Giant|giantkin]] and [[wyvern]] specimens.",
        "History": "The Blood Skull tribe was originally known as the Black Spear tribe, which was led by [[Cleric|shamans]] of [[Gruumsh]] and was named in honor of their god's favored weapon, [[The Bloodspear]]. It was one of the more fearsome orc clans in Thar as of the late 14{{th}} century DR when the upstart [[half-orc]] warchief [[Wertha]] rallied most of the tribe's warriors and overthrew the shamans in [[Bloodskull Keep]]. The tribe then became embroiled in a civil war for many years between Wertha's faction in Bloodskull Keep, calling themselves the Bloody Skulls, and the Gruumshites based in the tribe's outlying strongholds. While this infighting weakened the tribe's influence significantly, Wertha eventually wrested full control away from the Gruumshites and restored the clan to its former glory.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the Blood Skull tribe led a horde of orcs, [[hobgoblin]]s, and [[ogre]]s, bolstered by [[manticore]]s and [[wyvern]]s, to destroy the town of [[Glister]] and attack the city of [[Hulburg]]. Their defeat created a power vacuum among the monstrous tribes of Thar, leading to fighting between dozens of lesser tribes of orcs, [[goblinoids]], and [[Giant|giantkin]] who rushed to assert dominance.\n\nSecretly, this invasion had been made possible by [[Kardhel Terov]] of the [[Warlock Knights of Vaasa]], who had helped to bring together and equip the Blood Skulls' coalition. His goal had been to secure access to the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]] for [[Vaasa]].",
        "Members": "The orcs of the tribe were highly religious, having strong ties to clerics of the [[orc pantheon]]. The tribe was known to honor strength above all, and it was not uncommon for [[half-orc]]s to rise to power within the ranks if they demonstrated their skill in battle."
