        "mainbody": "he Silent Rain was a legendary mercenary group of secretive elven archers that destroyed their enemies with deadly precision.\nThe Silent Rain was led by the elf Nightshade, whose true identity was kept secret.\nInstead of seeking gold or fame, the Silent Rain only agreed to jobs that furthered elven causes and protected their interests, or involved destroying potential threats such as goblinoids, orcs, gnolls, and other evil creatures. They were contacted and hired by leaving a message in elvish near Evereska, whereupon the Silent Rain would send a representative if interested. The Silent Rain charged 100 gold pieces per week for their services once hired.\nThe Silent rain exclusively fought at range from ambushes, giving the enemy no chance to respond or even see them. Rarely leaving any survivors to tell of them, they were only identified by their distinctive arrows with unique arrowheads and black-striped red fletching.\nThe Silent Rain were based in Evereska, and ranged throughout northwest and north Faer√ªn.\nTheir leader Nightshade had a particular hatred of the Teeth company."
