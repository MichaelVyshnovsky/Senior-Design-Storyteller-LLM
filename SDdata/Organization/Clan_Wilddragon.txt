Clan Wilddragon was an extinct noble house of Eskorn.
Clan Wilddragon was one of the dynasties that ruled Eskorn centuries before the Spellplague. This clan was very popular in legends and songs, and Eskorn was called the "Wild Dragon Realm" after it.
It was believed that Clan Wilddragon was totally exterminated  by a rival clan, although some sages and legends claimed that a few descendants of the clan still survived in the 15th century DR, ignorant of their own lineages. Those surviving Wilddragons were accomplished adventurers and outlaws. According to legends, when the Wilddragons returned to the throne, Eskorn would become a prosperous land.
