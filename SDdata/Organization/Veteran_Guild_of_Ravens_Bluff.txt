The Veteran Guild of Ravens Bluff was a mercenary company based in Ravens Bluff, but also active in the Sea of Fallen Stars and the Vast, around 1358 DR.
As well as infantry, cavalry, archers, and wizards, they also had a unit of priests and even a musical unit composed of ten bards to improve morale.
They preferred work for governments or merchants, usually defeating pirates. They charged 1 gold piece per day for each member for their services.
The Society had by 1358 DR been recently founded by Giovanni the Drake, whod gathered many veterans of the Horde Wars living around Ravens Bluff.
