The '''Gray Ghosts''' were the only true [[thieves' guild]] of [[Gracklstugh]]. They were filled with [[derro]] and [[duergar]] outcasts and a few escaped slaves.

==Activities==
The Gray Ghosts had a special interest in a ruined [[black obelisk]] they had found that they believed contained "unimaginable power", so they tried to recollect all the fragments of the obelisk and rebuild it.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1486 DR]], the Gray Ghosts stole a [[red dragon]] egg intended to replace [[Themberchaud]] as the Wyrmsmith of Gracklstugh from the [[Keepers of the Flame]]. The Keepers used all their strength to eradicate the thieves and captured and executed the Gray Ghosts leader. The guild was then led by a triumvirate of renegade [[derro]] savants&mdash;[[Uskvil]] and the twin sisters [[Aliinka]] and [[Zubriska]].
