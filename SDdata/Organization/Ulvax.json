        "mainbody": "Ulvax was an Amnian merchant family based in Esmeltaran during the 14 century DR.\nAfter Ulvaxs loss of the spice trade and their relocation to Esmeltaran, they took up other investments such as local real estate.\nIn 1238 DR, Ulvaxs decline at the hands of the Ophal family and their mutual struggle over the rights to trade Zakharan spices began to escalate into further conflicts. This continued for a full century until the Murann Spice War of 1338 DR when, during the Night of Spiced Spears, some street-fighting between the familys guards turned into an extended battle with thousands wounded and hundreds dead.\nThe new Council of Six responded by investigating the situation and dispensing justice. As the instigator of the matter, Ulvax was stripped of its right to trade in Zakharan spices, and the associated assets were liquidated and transferred to new areas of investment that wouldnt conflict with the Ophals, such as Esmeltaran real estate. Although the two families refused to speak to each other, they were fully separated and were able to pursue their own paths. Ulvaxs wealth and prestige ultimately fell with their forced relocation, though they remained quite powerful within Esmeltaran."
