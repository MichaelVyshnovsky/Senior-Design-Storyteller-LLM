The Shining Order were a group of knights who fought against Morags invasion of their homeworld Azallah and their city Sahaladar in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
In the late 14 century DR, the Shining Order sent out Asheera, a paladin, and five other people into the demiplane inside the Source Stone to stop Morags invasion of their world. All but Asheera died during this mission. After meeting the Hero of Neverwinter, Asheera returned to her world probably hoping that the Hero would stop Morag.
The Shining Order was formed sometime before the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
