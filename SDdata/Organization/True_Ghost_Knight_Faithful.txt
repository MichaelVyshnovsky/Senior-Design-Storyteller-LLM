The '''True Ghost Knight Faithful''' was a cult that venerated the [[Ghost Knight of Galardoun]] as an incarnation of the then-dead [[deity]] [[Helm]]. The group met in the upstairs rooms of the [[Ten Trolls Fallen]] [[tavern]] in [[Waterdeep]]'s Trade Ward. The cult often quested to find the apparition that wandered the Heartlands.{{Cite dungeon/196/Eye on the Realms: The Ghost Knight of Galardoun|3}}
