Its name was a contraction of a much longer Elven phrase meaning "those who have their being in the sea haunted by the true dream". They worked to minimize conflict between their respective peoples.
Members of the asathalfinare shared in common that the vast majority of their worshipers were water-breathing species living beneath water and that the protection of those waters was paramount in all of their thoughts.
They included
* Deep Sashelas, creator of the sea elves and leader of the asathalfinare pantheon.
* Eadro, creator of the locathah and merfolk.
* Persana, god of tritons.
* Trishina, mother of the shalarin, goddess of the dolphins and consort of Deep Sashelas.
* Surminare, goddess of the selkies.
* Water Lion, an enigmatic god half-lion, half-fish.
* Syranita, patron deity of the aarakocra. and partly because she sought amity for her relatively weak race.
