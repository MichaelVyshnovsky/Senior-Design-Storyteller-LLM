        "mainbody": "century DR\nWindrunners was a Athasian thri-kreen tribe of insectoid nomads who lived in the desert of the Ringing Mountainss foothills on the world of Athas in the late 14 century DR.\nIn The Year of Despair, Malatran calendar, late 14 century DR, a group of heroes of the Living Jungle were sent from the Malatran Plateau through an elemental gate to the far-away world of Athas. Immediately upon arrival, the group was captured by Athasian elf slavers. A young thri-kreen named Kacha was among creatures captured by the elves, and he lamented being separated from his clutch. Subsequently, the heroes escaped when the elven caravan was attacked by a hungry sink worm. They seized the opportunity and freed Kacha, fleeing from the pursuers across the desert.\nAfter two days of travel across the hot sands, guided by Kacha, the group stumbled across the Windrunners tribe and their leader, Kirikku. Kacha convinced his tribe the strange adventurers were friends, not food. Happy with one of their number returned, chief Kirikku gifted the aliens four large erdlu eggs (an invaluable source of nourishment in the Athasian desert) and two enchanted apples of healing. The thri-kreen explained to the Malatran heroes how to reach their destination—the Ringing Forest—the way back to Toril. After parting ways, Windrunners embarked on a quest of revenge against the slaver elves whod wronged young Kacha."
