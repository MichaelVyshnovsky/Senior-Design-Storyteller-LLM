The '''Haddenbils''' brothers of [[Deepingdale]] were known for being the first to use dams to solve the local irrigation problems and provide water for their fields of [[oat]].

==Description==
The Haddenbils made dams from giant [[granite]] blocks and sealed them with clay and [[giant spider]]s' webs. The brothers gained the use of a ''[[spade of colossal excavation]]'' which they borrowed from a warrior whose identity is not known.
