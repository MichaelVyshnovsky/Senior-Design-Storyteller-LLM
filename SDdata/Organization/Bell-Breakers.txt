'''Bell-Breakers''' was a criminal organization, the muscle part of the [[Guild]] of [[Baldur's Gate]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
During the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the newly-risen Kingpin named [[Stone Lord]], started a guild war against the Guild, strategically taking out the Guild's agents, kingpins, and taking over their territory. The Stone Lord was a thrall of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], and as a part of the guild war, his men targeted gangs and smaller organizations under the Guild's rule. Bell-Breakers were among those hit by Stone Lord's men, however, their fate was unconfirmed. The Guild tasked [[Fruward the Nail]] with investigation shortly before the [[Zhentarim]] attempted to take over the Guild's operations in Baldur's Gate.

Fruward's report was a letter attesting to the Bell-Breakers' demise. The group and the belfry it was nesting in atop a temple in [[Heapside]] were obliterated by the Stone Lord.
