The shigharakhi, or the younger brothers, were promising flame mages who studied under Nar-Aidiya at the fortress of Krak al-Mazhar.
These individuals were called shigharak.
These young members of the Brotherhood of the True Flame were brought to the hidden fortress via magic. As part of their ultimate training, all shigharak were required to successfully research a new spell before their departure. When their studies were completed they were also transported away by magic after a geas had been placed upon them, preventing them from willingly revealing any secrets of the Brotherhood.
All of the shigharakhi wore an aba of the elements.
A second group of shigharakhi could also be found in the fortress of Krak al-Niraan studying under Jamal al-Yindannim.
