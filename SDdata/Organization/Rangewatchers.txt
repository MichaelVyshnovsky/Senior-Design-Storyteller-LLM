'''The Rangewatchers''' were an adventuring company.

==History==
In [[1335 DR]], the Rangewatchers battled a [[red dragon]] that was marauding against villages in the area. During the battle, three Rangewatchers were killed and [[Montolio Debrouchee]]'s face was melted. Montolio's skin was restored by healers, but his sight never returned. He felt pitied by his companions, so he retreated to an area later known as "[[Mooshie's Grove]]" to die. However, he found new life in gaining new skills through his senses other than sight.

==Notable members==
* [[Montolio Debrouchee]]
