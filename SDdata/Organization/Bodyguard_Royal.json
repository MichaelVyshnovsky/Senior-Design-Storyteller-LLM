        "mainbody": "The '''Bodyguard Royal''' were a premier group of [[Purple Dragons]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], tasked with guarding the royalty of [[Cormyr]].",
        "Recruitment": "The Bodyguard Royal consisted of some of the most competent Purple Dragons. They were meant to be loyal to the crown first and foremost. At a glance, their appointment by the then [[Royal Magician]], [[Vangerdahast Aeiulvana]], may have jeopardized this. In practice, however, Queen [[Filfaeril Obarskyr]] ensured only those who were more loyal to [[Azoun Obarskyr IV|Azoun IV]] remained the closest.\n\nVangerdahast still selected the Bodyguards, but they received subsequent training and screening from Filfaeril, her senior chambermaid (a [[Harper agent|Harper]]), and two [[Highknights]]. Those who were more loyal to Vangerdahast were assigned to the door or to duties as distant envoys. Those trusted by Queen Filfaeril would remain close at hand, ready to guard her and Azoun IV in their most private and defenseless moments."
