They tended to favor a hedonistic lifestyle, enjoying fine foods and drinks and the company of others. They loved beautiful things such as well-built edifices, works of art, and natural wonders such as the invigorating radiance of the sun rising over a magnificent natural landscape. The church welcomed all [[Gender and sex|genders]] equally, but was mostly composed of physically attractive members."

            "Society": "While relations between clergy members were generally good, friction sometimes occurred between tuneservants and more traditional members of the church. The main points of discontentment were the usage of holy spells for selfish reasons by tuneservants, and their support of irresponsible adventurers. In addition, temples run by tuneservants tend to forego traditional songs and hymns in favor of more recent works.\n\nWhile all churches paid heed to the patriarch of the faith, his influence was stronger in [[northwest Faer没n]] and dwindled the further away one moved from Waterdeep. Distant congregations such as the ones in [[Sembia]] paid the Patriarch no more than lip service, and only paid attention to his most urgent communications.",
