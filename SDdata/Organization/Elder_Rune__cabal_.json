        "mainbody": "The Elder Rune was a cabal of liches who sought to discover a \"master\" rune that could control other magical runes. It was their ambition to use this rune to control and subvert magical effects such as wards, bindings, gates, and portals.\nOne of the goals of the Vellurith, a game of manipulation played among the beholders of Toril, was to influence the Elder Rune (or similar lich cabals) toward goals outside of Faer√ªn and the affairs of beholderkind."
