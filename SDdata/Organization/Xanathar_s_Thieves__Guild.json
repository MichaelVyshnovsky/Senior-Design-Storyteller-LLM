        "Geography": "This criminal and slaver network was one of the most powerful on the Sword Coast, but often unintentionally acted as a buffer against other evil organizations. They operated out of [[Skullport]], but were otherwise largely active in Waterdeep.",
        "Membership": "Members of the guild were trained in stealth, discretion, and tactics with [[fighter]]s, [[rogue]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, [[wizard]]s, and [[expert]]s, which comprised most of its numbers. An ever-growing organization, it utilized multiple mouthpieces to protect and conceal the identity of the [[Xanathar]]. To join, a member had to prove their ruthlessness, obedience, and loyalty by committing a serious crime—killing or selling a friend or family member into slavery—as well as paying 300 [[gp]]. The typical agent earned dues of 60 gp a month.\n\nSupport generally came in these ways:\n* Any member given an assignment would receive a bodyguard or assistant, such as a [[bugbear]], [[wererat]], [[kenku]], or [[gazer]], with secret instructions to spy on and assassinate the agent in case of failure.\n* The guild provided safe refuges such as cellars in the sewers.\n\nAmong the low-ranking guild members, no-one really knew who [[Xanathar]] was. Few had an inkling he was a beholder, and fewer still had spoken to him.\n\nGiven that the faction was evil at the core, advancement through assassination was a popular \"shortcut\".\n \n[[File:Surveillance.png|thumb|220x220px|''Five dwarves that served as a surveillance system for the guild.'']]\nSome of the more unusual members of the guild in the late 1400s DR were a group of five [[dwarves]] that had been modified by the [[mind flayer]] [[Nihiloor]] to operate and serve as a surveillance system for the [[Zushaxx|Xanathar]].\n\nThe Xanathar Guild was also known to employ a number of [[goblin]]s and [[bugbear]]s, some of whom were infected with [[intellect devourer]]s, presumably by Nihiloor.<ref>",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Ahmaergo]]: a [[dwarf]] slaver\n* [[Arizza]]\n* [[Avaereene]]\n* [[Colstan Rhuul]]\n* [[Shindia Darkeyes]]\n* [[Nar'l Xibrindas]]: [[drow]] [[wizard]] advisor\n* [[Nihiloor]]: [[mind flayer]]\n* [[Noska Ur'gray]]: dwarf enforcer\n* [[Nakoto]]: the operative in charge of the guild's business in [[Daggerford]] ''circa'' [[1372 DR]].\n* [[Ott Steeltoes]]"
