        "mainbody": "Xanathars Thieves Guild, or simply Xanathar Guild, was a criminal and slaving organization in Waterdeep and Skullport run by a paranoid elder beholder.\nThis criminal and slaver network was one of the most powerful on the Sword Coast, but often unintentionally acted as a buffer against other evil organizations. They operated out of Skullport, but were otherwise largely active in Waterdeep.\nMembers of the guild were trained in stealth, discretion, and tactics with fighters, rogues, sorcerers, wizards, and experts, which comprised most of its numbers. An ever-growing organization, it utilized multiple mouthpieces to protect and conceal the identity of the Xanathar. To join, a member had to prove their ruthlessness, obedience, and loyalty by committing a serious crime—killing or selling a friend or family member into slavery—as well as paying 300 gp. The typical agent earned dues of 60 gp a month.\nSupport generally came in these ways\n* Any member given an assignment would receive a bodyguard or assistant, such as a bugbear, wererat, kenku, or gazer, with secret instructions to spy on and assassinate the agent in case of failure.\n* The guild provided safe refuges such as cellars in the sewers.\nAmong the low-ranking guild members, no-one really knew who Xanathar was. Few had an inkling he was a beholder, and fewer still had spoken to him.\nGiven that the faction was evil at the core, advancement through assassination was a popular \"shortcut\".\nthumb|220x220px|Five dwarves that served as a surveillance system for the guild.\nSome of the more unusual members of the guild in the late 1400s DR were a group of five dwarves that had been modified by the mind flayer Nihiloor to operate and serve as a surveillance system for the Xanathar.\nThe Xanathar Guild was also known to employ a number of goblins and bugbears, some of whom were infected with intellect devourers, presumably by Nihiloor.\n* Ahmaergo a dwarf slaver\n* Arizza\n* Avaereene\n* Colstan Rhuul\n* Shindia Darkeyes\n* Narl Xibrindas drow wizard advisor\n* Nihiloor mind flayer\n* Noska Urgray dwarf enforcer\n* Nakoto the operative in charge of the guilds business in Daggerford circa 1372 DR.\n* Ott Steeltoes"
