The '''Thayan Resurrection''' was a secret rebel organization born among the [[Red Wizards of Thay]].

==Activities==
Composed of wizards of all schools of magic except [[necromancy]], the Thayan Resurrection's goal was the overthrow of [[Szass Tam]] and the [[necromancers]] from their rule of [[Thay]].

==Members==
Among the group were sincere revolutionaries hoping for a land more adapted to human life and power-hungry individuals who wanted to replace one ruler with another. They were structured in autonomous cells composed of just a few members in order to make it difficult for Tam's followers to destroy them with a single blow. Two noted members were [[Syranna]] and [[Mennek Ariz]] who, with help from adventurers, destroyed the most loyal [[liches]] of Tam in the secret dungeon of [[Doomvault]].

==Members==
* [[Syranna]], cell leader in [[Doomvault]]
* [[Mennek Ariz]], infiltrated [[Bloodgate Keep]]
* [[Umara Ankhlab]], possibly the founder<ref>
* [[Vorja]], possibly recruited in Doomvault
* [[Lahnis]], possibly recruited in Doomvault
* [[Rath Modar]]
* [[Jesket]] heavily hinted
* [[Fadime Zatar]] very probably
