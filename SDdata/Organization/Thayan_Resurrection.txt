The Thayan Resurrection was a secret rebel organization born among the Red Wizards of Thay.
Composed of wizards of all schools of magic except necromancy, the Thayan Resurrections goal was the overthrow of Szass Tam and the necromancers from their rule of Thay.
Among the group were sincere revolutionaries hoping for a land more adapted to human life and power-hungry individuals who wanted to replace one ruler with another. They were structured in autonomous cells composed of just a few members in order to make it difficult for Tams followers to destroy them with a single blow. Two noted members were Syranna and Mennek Ariz who, with help from adventurers, destroyed the most loyal liches of Tam in the secret dungeon of Doomvault.
* Syranna, cell leader in Doomvault
* Mennek Ariz, infiltrated Bloodgate Keep
* Umara Ankhlab, possibly the founder
* Vorja, possibly recruited in Doomvault
* Lahnis, possibly recruited in Doomvault
* Rath Modar
* Jesket heavily hinted
* Fadime Zatar very probably
