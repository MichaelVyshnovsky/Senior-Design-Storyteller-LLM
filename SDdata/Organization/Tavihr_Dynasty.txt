The '''Tavihr Dynasty''' was the second of six dynasties of the [[Second Age of Calimshan]].

==Organization==
Like the rulers before them, the leaders of the Tavihr Dynasty were [[bakkal]]s, or high [[priest]]s of their people.

==Activities==
The harsh and corrupt rulers of this dynasty actively sought to expand the territory of the empire. They were the ones to first add the territories of [[Tethyr]] and the [[Purple Hills]] as emirates to the empire, enslaving the lighter skinned [[Tethyrian]]s.

The Tavihr Dynasty built garrisons and fortresses in the [[Iltkazar Range]] to defend against organizing groups of [[ogre]]s and [[giant]]s. These were located primarily near the [[Omlarandin Mountains]] south of the [[Wurlur]].

==Technology==
The Tavihrs adapted the reed boats used in coastal trade for military uses, creating Calmishan's first [[Nallojal|navy]]. They made use of [[bronze]] and [[iron]] weapons and armor for the first time, technology stolen from the [[dwarves]] of [[High Shanatar]].

==Base of Operations==
The bakkal's palace was located in the city of [[Calimport]].

==History==
The Tavihr Dynasty succeed the previous [[Pahlemn Dynasty]] in {{Yearlink|-2829}}.

The time of the Tavihr Dynasty was a time of wars.

The Tavihrs were prevented from expanding farther north than the Purple Hills by the great forests and the [[elves]] who guarded them.

In {{Yearlink|-2381}}, the Iltkazar garrisons witnessed a strange occurrence in the skies, when three [[beholder]] [[spelljammer|colony ships]] crashed into the [[Alimir Mountains]] on a stormy night in [[Tarsakh]].

The surviving beholders soon attacked the eastern troops, initially overwhelming them, but the bakkal's armies eventually were able to drive the eye tyrants back into the mountains.

The dynasty ended in the same year, when the dynasty's last bakkal and his twelve heirs were all assassinated during their victory celebration over the beholders. The entire palace was set ablaze by the assassins, and the conflagration spread into the western half of Calimport, destroying much of the city.

The Tavihrs were succeeded by the [[Erehnir Dynasty]].

==Trivia==
One of the ''[[sabbans]]'' in the city of Calimport was named after this dynasty. [[Tavihr Sabban]] contained about nine-tenths of [[Armada Ward]]'s buildings and businesses.
