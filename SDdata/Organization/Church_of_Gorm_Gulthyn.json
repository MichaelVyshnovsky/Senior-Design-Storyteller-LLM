        "mainbody": "rm's devoted were sworn to protect the Stout Folk from the hostile forces beyond their holds, and were never to waver in their duty to these sacred charges, remaining ever-alert and unceasingly vigilant so as to never be surprised. As every priest knew, they had to be willing to pay \"Gorm's greatest price\" to ensure the lives of their charge, clan, and community, taking solace in the knowledge that their name would be remembered for generations.",
        "Dogma": "Gorm's devoted were sworn to protect the Stout Folk from the hostile forces beyond their holds, and were never to waver in their duty to these sacred charges, remaining ever-alert and unceasingly vigilant so as to never be surprised. As every priest knew, they had to be willing to pay \"Gorm's greatest price\" to ensure the lives of their charge, clan, and community, taking solace in the knowledge that their name would be remembered for generations.",
        "Activities": "Upon entering the church, each member was assigned a charge to protect and act as the bodyguard for; higher ranked and more powerful veteran priests could choose their charges, often picking important clan members, but novice initiates were often given assignments at random. Such charges might be children, a childrearing parent of either sex, the elderly, or the otherwise infirm, and the foremost aim of any lesser priest was protecting their assigned charge.\n\nThey also instructed other local dwarves about the value of vigilance, and organized the community's defense in the steady, reliable way Gorm had taught.",
        "Organization": {
            "Membership": "[[File:Church of Gorm Gulthyn.png|thumb|''A priest of Gorm Gulthyn'']]\nAll dwarves who served as guardians in some way worshiped Gorm, and those that required protection or armed assistance paid tribute to him as appeasement. [[Lawful good]] and [[lawful neutral]] dwarves in particularly turned to his faith, though Gorm accepted worshipers of all alignments except chaotic or evil ones, with [[chaotic good]] being an exception. Becoming a formal member of Gorm's clergy required a stricter code of honor than simply being a worshiper ([[true neutral|true]] or [[chaotic neutral]]ity not being allowed).\n\nGorm's [[cleric]]s, especially his [[specialty priest]]s, were known as ''barakor'', a dwarvish word loosely translated to mean \"those who shield\". The vast majority of his clergy (95%) was male, and before the [[Time of Troubles]] they were entirely so. Most members of the clergy were either [[mountain dwarves]] (48%) or [[hill dwarves]] (52%). Though nearly every subrace was called to be a barakor, and while there were no formal barriers to entry for [[jungle dwarf|jungle dwarves]] and [[gray dwarves]], none had joined his ranks in more recent history.",
            "Titles": "Novice members of the clergy were known as the Watchful Guards, while full members were known as the Vigilant Host. In ascending order of rank, priests were known by the titles of Lookout of the First Rank, Scout of the Second Rank, Sentry of the Third Rank, Sentinel of the Fourth Rank, Defender of the Fifth Rank, and Guardian of the Sixth Rank, with [[High Old One]]s of the church having individual titles and being collectively known as Lord and Lady Protectors.",
            "Classes": "Becoming a specialty priest of Gorm required physical prowess and vitality, wisdom, and a lawful disposition. Such barakors had the benefit of being immune to magic meant to put them to sleep, and often needed less sleep than normal. They got access to spells that let them better protect, or keep a closer eye out, notably the ability to cast a ''[[Undetectable alignment|know alignment]]'' spell that overrode all magical misdirection and concealment. Even regular priests however were especially wary, able to interpret noises, half-seen movements and other symptoms of movement with startling accuracy. Provided they had time to study their surroundings, they could recognize the exact distance and direction of features around them.\n\nThe clergy of Fire Eyes was dominated by specialty priests, though [[crusader]]s and clerics made up a larger percentage collectively and clerics frequently trained as fighters or [[dwarven defender]]s, the latter of which in the were offered the highest possible honor within its ranks.",
            "Orders": "Many knightly orders of multiple sizes had been founded in Gorm's name and been affiliated with his clergy over the centuries. Among the more legendary orders were:\n\n* The [[Company of the Scarlet Moon]]\n\n* The [[Fellowship of the Stern Gauntlet]]\n\n* The [[Guardian-Knights of Gorm]]\n\n* The [[Order of the Smoking Shield]]\n\n* The [[Sacred Shields of Berronar's Blessed]]: One of the oldest and most revered orders of Gorm, which could be found in nearly any clanhold or kingdom. The Knights of the Sacred Shield guarded nurseries of dwarven children and parents, and were also charged with recovering kidnapped youths, with at least two dwarven clans owing their continued existence to the rescue of an entire generation from the clutches of [[Lolth]]'s priests.\n\n* The [[Silent Sentinels]]\n\n* The [[Twin-Blade Axes of Fire]]\n\n* The [[Vigilant Halberdiers]]"
        },
        "Rituals": "Barakor prayed for spells in the morning, usually followed by a tour of their community to ensure that no incidents happened at night.\n\nGorm's priests celebrated each festival in the [[Calendar of Harptos]] as a sacred event, and on such holy days they gathered to perform (as outsiders saw them) tedious procedures, including formal salutes, didactic, chanted prayers, and a ritual involving the rhythmic grounding of weapons. Other rituals involved silent vigils, muttered prayers and answering Gorm's visions. Offering were made to Gorm in the form of used weapons to guard, even if broken, anointed with tears, sweat, and drops of blood from the worshiper.\n\nAt the height of the salute, if performed at the chancel of one of his temples, Gorm's power might open the door kept behind the altar and through it bestow [[scroll]]s, [[potion]]s, weapons, armor, maps,Â or instructive phantom images to help his followers fulfill their duties. A worshiper wearing, carrying or using a gift of the god typically had a great boost in morale.",
        "Bases": {
            "Shrines & Temples": "[[Category:Temples to Gorm Gulthyn]]\nTemples dedicated to Gorm were typically constructions of plain stone, always undecorated caverns or rooms quarried from solid rock. The altar was a stone bench in front of a massive door, closed and locked, that represented a location a dwarf might have to protect, though instead the central altar might be an old tomb casket that if occupied, contained the remains of a dead (not [[undead]]) priest of the Golden Guardian.\n\nGorm's houses of worship were protected, predictably, by his Guardian-priests, and most of his temples contained a small armory and were well-fortified against attack."
        },
        "Symbol": "Their [[holy symbol]] was a miniature bronze shield attached to a burnished steel chain, typically worn around the neck as a medallion.",
        "Possessions": {
            "Dress": "[[File:Barrowin concept art.png|right|thumb|250px|[[Barrowin Undurr]], [[gold dwarf]] [[cleric]] of Gorm]]\nGorm's clergy typically wore red and black cloaks and helms, often marking their status with red and black armbands on their left and right arms respectively. Regardless of whether they were expecting to do some strenuous activity or simple ceremonies, they always wore the finest armor (in both metal and type) they could find under their clothes. They never removed all their armor unless in need of care of some kind.",
            "Weapons": "Similarly to their stance regarding their armor, Gormites never left all their weapons aside."
        },
        "Magic": {
            "Spells": "A number of [[spell]]s were unique to Gormite priests or were closely associated with them:\n* ''[[Alert allies]]''\n* ''[[Blessed watchfulness]]''\n* ''[[Fire eyes of Gorm]]''\n* ''[[Iron vigil]]''\n* ''[[Sentry of Helm|Sentry of Gorm]]''"
        },
        "Relationships": "Gorm was well regarded by the dwarves for his unwavering commitment to their defense. Most saw him as stern, but they could not ignore his role in the survival of their remaining strongholds. He was well-regarded by [[human]], [[halfling]], and [[gnome]] followers of [[Helm]], [[Arvoreen]], and [[Gaerdal Ironhand]], but dismissed as the traditionally dour dwarf by [[elves]] and other chaotically-inclined individuals.",
        "History": "Gorm, along with [[Haela Brightaxe]], died in the [[Morndinsamman]]'s battle with the duergar deities [[Laduguer]] and [[Deep Duerra]] in [[1383 DR]], his divinity finally spent. After the [[Second Sundering]], he was once again present and revered by the dwarves, but the exact circumstances of his return were unknown."
