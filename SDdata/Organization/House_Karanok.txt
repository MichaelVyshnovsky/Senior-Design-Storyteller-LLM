House Karanok was the insane ruling family of the city of Luthcheq in Chessenta. They claimed to be pure-blood Mulan and descendants of the god-king Nanna-Sin.
They believed that wizards (including also sorcerers, dwarves, and elves) were evil and must be burned. They worshiped Entropy, a strange sphere of annihilation. In 1370 DR, Tiamat posed as Entropy and granted them clerical spells.

The Karanoks became the rulers of Luthcheq under suspicious circumstances in the . Initially, they ruled in a typical Chessentan style.
In the , however, Luthcheq was defeated in a war against Mordulkin and the Karanoks blamed wizard spies for their loss. With this, they started their crusade against arcane magic.
Then, in the , from nowhere, Entropy manifested itself inside House Karanoks mansion, killing a wizard they were torturing. The Karanoks saw this as an omen and began worshiping it.
Tiamat started granting clerical powers to the Karanoks in the , in order to manipulate them.
Then everything changed after Tchazzar disappeared in the chaos of the Spellplague in the . Ishual Karanok emerged as a war hero and leader who united the divided survivors of Luthcheq. He went on to battle rampaging monsters, aberrations sent by the Abolethic Sovereignty, and opportunistic invaders and colonists from northern lands, and so kept Chessenta alive. In the , Ishual Karanok merged the different coinages of the city-states of Chessenta into a single currency. After a time, when the fighting had lessened, he returned to Luthcheq and the Karanok family home. There, Ishual disbanded his familys cult, arguing that their goal of destroying all arcane magic and its users had been achieved with Mystras death. Nevertheless, he kept their god Entropy as a symbol of power.
In 1479 DR, the ruler Shala Karanok was ousted from power for a brief time by the returned Tchazzar. However, after the Battle of Luthcheq, she regained control over the city.
