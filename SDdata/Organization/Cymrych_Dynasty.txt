The Cymrych dynasty was a noble family who were High Kings and Queens of the Moonshae Isles, named for their legendary ancestor Cymrych Hugh.
The family possessed two symbols of office the Crown of the High King and the Sword of Cymrych Hugh.
Originally known as the Hugh family, the Cymrychs traced their lineage to Talfir nobility from Ebenfar who immigrated to the Moonshaes in the 2 century DR. Their ancestor, Callidyrr Hugh, became King of Corwell in the , after quelling a six-year civil war between the Ffolk that had sparked following the end of the First Dynasty of the Moonshaes.
Callidyrrs son and successor was the legendary hero Cymrych Hugh, who defeated Kazgoroth in the , and was swiftly declared to be the first High King of the Ffolk. His first son, Warren I, would change the family name to Cymrych and become the first Cymrych monarch in the , although his rule would see a collapse of unity between the Ffolk as well as the arrival of the Northmen to the Isles.
Beginning at this time, all of the various royal families of the Moonshaes began to adopt the Cymrych name, generally by changing their surnames whenever a Cymrych son or daughter married into their families. Within a few generations, virtually all Ffolk dynasties were Cymrych dynasties.
The first of the Cymrych High Kings were not seen as strong leaders, leading their vassal kingdoms to squabble and disobey them. However, in the late 3 century DR, High King Gwylloch and his son Ketheryll would not only be highly successful in their wars against the Northmen, but would also bring the recalcitrant Ffolk kings to heel, especially on the isle of Gwynneth.
The family would hold the office of High King for seven centuries before the loss of their symbols of office caused their authority to collapse. 
At the same time that the family changed its name to "Carrathal", the many other Cymrych royal families likewise began to change the spelling and pronunciation of their names. This led to the distinct identities of the families of Cambridge, Cyric, Kendrick, Kimball, Kincaid, Riker, and Selkirk.
