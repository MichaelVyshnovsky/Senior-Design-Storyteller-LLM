The '''Kubahachi''' clan were a family in [[Wa]] and the leaders of [[Aru Province]] during the late 1600s and early 1700s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==History==
After the removal of [[Koji Matsutomo]] in {{YearlinkConvert|1652|WY}}, the daimyate of Aru Province passed to [[Seiji Kubahachi]]. The Kubahachi clan governed the province ably for two generations.

However, the third daimyo, [[Koji Kubahachi]], was cruel and vindictive. In {{YearlinkConvert|1713|WY}}, when he levied a special tax to pay for castle improvements and a certain fishing village fell short, Koji killed every inhabitant, razed it, salted the earth, and did the same to two neighboring villages, insisting they must been aware of a plot to defraud him. In {{YearlinkConvert|1717|WY}}, two [[ninja]]s infiltrated Aru disguised as pilgrims and tried to assassinate Koji. They were killed in the attack, Koji couldn't identify who hired them, and in revenge and as a message to his unknown enemy, he executed every one of the pilgrims in the train. At this excess, shogun [[Masanori]] removed Koji both from office and from life, and returned the daimyate to the [[Matsutomo]] clan, under [[Masakito Matsutomo]].
