'''House Mizzrym''' was the fifth [[drow]] house of [[Menzoberranzan]] in [[1372 DR]].

==Headquarters==
House Mizzrym was located on the plateau of [[Qu'ellarz'orl]]. It was guarded by [[foulwing]]s, which some members of the house, including [[Pharaun Mizzrym]], could ride.

==Activities==
Mages of House Mizzrym were well known for their skill at [[illusion]]s.

==History==
Founded relatively recently compared to other drow noble houses in {{Yearlink|-643}}, House Mizzrym's rise to power over the centuries was founded on trade, including with non-drow races. By [[1357 DR]], the House had cultivated clandestine trade deals with [[deep gnomes]] and garnered a great deal of wealth. This allowed it to rise to the position of seventh house of Menzoberranzan.

In [[1359 DR]], House Mizzrym moved up to sixth house when [[House Oblodra]] was destroyed during the [[Time of Troubles]] by [[House Baenre]].

During the [[Silence of Lolth]] ([[1372 DR]]â€“[[1373 DR]]), House Mizzrym climbed the ranks once again to fifth house thanks to the treachery and fall of [[House Agrach Dyrr]]. 

In [[1484 DR]], House Mizzrym ascended to the fourth house after the departure of [[House Xorlarrin]] for [[Q'Xorlarrin]], replacing [[House Faen Tlabbar]].
