House Mizzrym was the fifth drow house of Menzoberranzan in 1372 DR.
House Mizzrym was located on the plateau of Quellarzorl. It was guarded by foulwings, which some members of the house, including Pharaun Mizzrym, could ride.
Mages of House Mizzrym were well known for their skill at illusions.
Founded relatively recently compared to other drow noble houses in , House Mizzryms rise to power over the centuries was founded on trade, including with non-drow races. By 1357 DR, the House had cultivated clandestine trade deals with deep gnomes and garnered a great deal of wealth. This allowed it to rise to the position of seventh house of Menzoberranzan.
In 1359 DR, House Mizzrym moved up to sixth house when House Oblodra was destroyed during the Time of Troubles by House Baenre.
During the Silence of Lolth (1372 DRâ€“1373 DR), House Mizzrym climbed the ranks once again to fifth house thanks to the treachery and fall of House Agrach Dyrr. 
In 1484 DR, House Mizzrym ascended to the fourth house after the departure of House Xorlarrin for QXorlarrin, replacing House Faen Tlabbar.
