The Tribe of the Elk was a nomadic group of Reghedman barbarians that dwelled within the tundra of Icewind Dale. They lived a relatively peaceful life, in harmony with the folks of the nearby Ten Towns.
Like other Reghedmen tribes, the Tribe of the Elk lived a largely nomadic life, chasing migrations of animals across the tundra. Historically, they have also settled in civilized towns and settlements of the North.
After the Battle of Icewind Dale in the , few members were left and the women of the tribe were forced to scavenge for food on the tundra. Drizzt DoUrden occasionally left slain reindeer where the tribe could find them.
Wulfgar assumed control of the tribes and convinced them to join forces with the men of Ten-Towns against the army of Akar Kessel, wielder of the Crenshinibon. Together, the allied forces were victorious over the dark wizard.
After the battle, the Reghedmen tribes split into two groups. Some remained in Icewind Dale, led by Revjak from Caer-Konig, while the other group followed Wulfgar to Settlestone. Originally built by the dwarves over two hundred years before, the Reghedmen rebuilt and lived a prosperous life as traders and merchants for the dwarves.
Eventually, Berkthgar became the new leader of the tribe after the death of his predecessor during the war with the drow. He decided that the barbarians would return to their old way of life on the tundra.
After the death of Kierstaad the Swift, Wulfgars son Bruenorson became chieftain of the tribe. He went on to rule for at least a decade during the late 14 century.
As of the , the Tribe of the Elk had been led by Jarund Elkhardt for two decades. Under his rule the tribe cared little for the Ten Towns and lived in peace with its citizens.
