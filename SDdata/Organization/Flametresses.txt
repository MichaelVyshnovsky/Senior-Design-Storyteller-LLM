The '''Flametresses''' were a band of traveling [[priest]]esses of [[Sune]] who traveled, among other places, throughout the [[Dalelands]] during the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
They priestesses were particularly well known at the [[Pushy Pixie|Pushy Pixie Inn]] within the town of [[Velarsburg]], where they would stop once a month and display their skill in the art of dancing. These performances would often show up the local, more risque dancers at the Pixie, though the rowdy nature of the establishment may have hid any resentment or animosity.
