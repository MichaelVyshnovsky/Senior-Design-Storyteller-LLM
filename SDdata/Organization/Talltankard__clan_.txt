The '''Talltankard''' clan was an expansive clan of [[Tethyr]]ian [[halfling]]s who reached into [[Amn]] and [[Waterdeep]].

==Base of Operations==
Many Talltankards lived in and around [[Vineshade]] in the [[Purple Hills]] of Tethyr.

By the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Talltankards had bought an old [[Hamlar]] estate in the Amnian city of [[Purskul]] and named it [[Tankardstall Hall]], and enjoyed "gold" status in high society thanks to their lavish parties.

==Members==
* [[Bungobar Talltankard]], [[adventurer]] and ostensible leader of the [[Buckleswashers]] in Waterdeep.
* [[Lyratha Talltankard]], true leader of the Buckleswashers and wife of Bungobar.
* Master [[Cumber Talltankard]], a vintner of Vineshade.
* Guildmistress [[Sunni Talltankard-Vineshigh]], of the Vineshade [[Vintners' Guild]].
* [[Estemal Talltankard]], founder and commander of [[Arvoreen's Marchers]].
* [[Jhessar Talltankard|Jhessar "Oldeyes" Talltankard]], the Shining Helm of the [[Heralds of FaerÃ»n]] in [[Saradush]].
