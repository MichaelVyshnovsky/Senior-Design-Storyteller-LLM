The Talltankard clan was an expansive clan of Tethyrian halflings who reached into Amn and Waterdeep.
Many Talltankards lived in and around Vineshade in the Purple Hills of Tethyr.
By the 14 century DR, the Talltankards had bought an old Hamlar estate in the Amnian city of Purskul and named it Tankardstall Hall, and enjoyed "gold" status in high society thanks to their lavish parties.
