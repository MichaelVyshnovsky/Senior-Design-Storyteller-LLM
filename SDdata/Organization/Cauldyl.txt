'''Cauldyl''' was a merchant organization and a noble family from the city of [[Arrabar]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Organization==
House Cauldyl was one of the oldest and most powerful merchant families of Arrabar. The oldest families held nine-tenth of the city's wealth while the younger merchant houses, such as [[House Matrell]], fought for the one-tenth share of the market. The estate of the Cauldyl family was a sprawling mansion that also housed the merchant house's sizable mercenary and guard forces.

Members of House Cauldyl were considered to be the most unpleasant, uppity, pretentious, and sneering people of the Shining Arrabar.
