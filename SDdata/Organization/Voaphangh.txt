'''Voaphangh''' was a [[human]] House that was one of the twenty Houses that formed the [[Onsruur]] (the council of lords) that governed [[Khôltar]], the Iron City, in [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|88}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 66: Khôltar, Part 17, More on the Onsruur}}

==Organization==
This family did not have any significant physical traits that distinguished their bloodline, but they stood out by being self-controlled and sophisticated, masterfully playing their role as suave socialites. The Voaphangh were focused on becoming "first among equals" or even superior to all the other Onsruur Houses and pursued this goal with ruthless energy.

==Activities==
The Voaphangh had tentacles in every type of Iron City business, but their emphasis waxed and waned in mercurial fashion. The family's influence spread far beyond the walls of Khôltar to the city-states of the [[Vilhon Reach]] and [[Chessenta]], and the various factions in [[Sembia]], covertly supporting many ambitious claims to power in the hopes that some would seize control and then be indebted to their Khôltan backers.

==Relationships==
The Voaphangh House was a strong ally of the [[Yulzaunt]] House, but hated and feared by all the other Onsruur families. Their most acrimonious rival was the [[Pelardh]] clan.
