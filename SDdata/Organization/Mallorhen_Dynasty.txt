The '''Mallorhen''' family was a noble house of [[Tethyr]] that briefly held the throne in the 9{{th}} century [[DR]] during the greater [[House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul|Ithal-Strohm-Bormul]] period.

==History==
[[Tibor Mallorhen]] came to the throne by marrying King [[Strohm V]]'s eldest daughter, who did not inherit it on her father's passing in the {{YearlinkName|832}}. Instead, her spouse Tibor became king, followed by their son [[Samyte Mallorhen|Samyte]]. Though they had several sons, the dynasty was cut short by the assassin [[Uthaedeol|Uthaedeol the Blood-drenched]], who killed the king and his heirs in the {{YearlinkName|841}}. With the dynasty extinguished, the throne passed to Strohm's younger daughter, [[Alisande Bormul|Alisande]], who started the [[Queens' Dynasty]]
