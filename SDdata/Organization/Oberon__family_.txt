The '''Oberon''' family was a [[patriar]] family that owned the majority of [[Baldur's Gate]]'s dry docks.

==Description==
The Oberons lived in a home that was situated to the central-south area of [[Manorborn]].

==History==
In [[1482 DR]], a young member of the Oberon family, along with other nobles, removed the hand of the [[Beloved Ranger]] statue. They used a [[dagger]] as a [[crowbar]] and [[hammer]], which bore the mark of the Oberon family. The gouged dagger was dropped, and pointed this individual to the crime. As such, the young Oberon hid away in [[Horgold Hadru]]'s cellar, along with the others, as Hadru owed one of the patriar families a favor.

In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, Baldur's Gate became plagued by a series of murders and disappearances. The members of the [[Flaming Fist]] showed little interest in addressing the incidents, but after the patriar families of [[Caldwell]], Oberon, and [[Linnacher]] became affected, the pressure from Flaming Fist demanding investigations from their superiors started to increase.

==Notable Members==
*[[Harette Oberon]], a lady patron of the arts of the Oberon family in [[1492 DR]].
*[[Ulis Oberon]], a member of the Oberon family murdered and burned by [[the Guild]] in 1492 DR.
