'''House Crownsilver''' was a royal noble house of [[Cormyr]] whose estate was situated beyond the [[Royal Gardens]] in [[Suzail]], [[Cormyr]]. The family crest was three silver crowns that appeared to be falling, but were pierced by a downward-pointing silver sword, on a dusky-blue field.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, the family was one of two remaining royal houses in Cormyr. The Crownsilvers disliked the younger noble houses' mercantile activities and held [[House Alsevir]], [[Goldfeather|House Goldfeather]], and [[Marliir|House Marliir]] in particular disdain.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail}}

==History==
The house descended from [[Silver (human house)|House Silver]]. The house existed some time before the {{YearlinkName|245}}, after the split of the Silver family.

In the {{YearlinkName|1448}}, the house opposed the marriage of Crown Prince [[Irvel Obarskyr]] to [[Ospra Goldfeather]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|6}}
