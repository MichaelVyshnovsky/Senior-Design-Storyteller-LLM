        "mainbody": "lan Hammerhand was a shield dwarf clan of both Ravens Bluff in the Vast, and of Earthfast in the Earthfast Mountains in north Faerûn and the Earthroot region of the Underdark.\nThe Hammerhands were a clan with a long history, being well established in Earthfast of old and in Sarbreen before it fell in the Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR. Though they eventually moved out of Earthfast, they remained in Ravens Bluff, the human city built over the ruins of Sarbreen.\nSeveral members of Clan Hammerhand fought in the Horde Wars of the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR, After the war, the Hammerhands decided to resettle in their entirety in Earthfast. This necessitated warring against the local goblinoids besieging the city. Therefore, two hundred Hammerhands became mercenaries to gain experience and earn money to support their clan.\nArriving in the late 1360s DR, the Hammerhands were much-needed reinforcements for Earthfast. Their assistance gave the dwarves there time to fortify the defenses of Alagh Rorncaurak before 1369 DR.\nClan Hammerhand was led by Garren Hammerhand in the 1360s DR. It included 200 mercenaries.\nHammerhand mercenaries cost 5 gp per person per week, or a portion thereof.\nWhile in the process of resettling in Earthfast, Clan Hammerhand remained based in Ravens Bluff.\nFor their mercenary trade, they kept offices in Ravens Bluff and Tantras in the Vast, and in Telflamm in Thesk. They mainly operated in the Vast and in the Bloodstone Lands.\nTo be distinctive, dwarven mercenaries of Clan Hammerhand decorated their hair and beards with beads, from plain stone to bejeweled gold.\nHammerhand mercenaries were all infantry soldiers, but carried a variety of different weapons, usually hammers but also battleaxes and footmans picks. They were skilled at subterranean maneuvers and sieges.\nCategoryDwarven clans\nCategoryMilitary organizations\nCategoryMercenary companies\nCategoryOrganizations in Ravens Bluff\nCategoryOrganizations in Tantras\nCategoryOrganizations in Telflamm\nCategoryOrganizations in Earthfast\nCategoryOrganizations in the Earthfast Mountains\nCategoryOrganizations in the Vast\nCategoryOrganizations in the Bloodstone Lands\nCategoryOrganizations in North Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in the Earthroot\nCategoryOrganizations in the Underdark\nCategoryOrganizations in Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\nazx0vienkmomhu8redl6nepuishvc7y"
