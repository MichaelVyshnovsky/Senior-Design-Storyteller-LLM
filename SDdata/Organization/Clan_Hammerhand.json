        "mainbody": "'''Clan Hammerhand''' was a [[shield dwarf]] clan of both [[Ravens Bluff]] in the [[Vast]], and of [[Earthfast]] in the [[Earthfast Mountains]] in [[north Faer没n]] and the [[Earthroot]] region of the [[Underdark]].",
        "History": "The Hammerhands were a clan with a long history, being well established in Earthfast of old and in [[Sarbreen]] before it fell in the [[649 DR|Year of the Bloody Crown, 649 DR]]. Though they eventually moved out of Earthfast, they remained in Ravens Bluff, the [[human]] city built over the ruins of Sarbreen.\n\nSeveral members of Clan Hammerhand fought in the [[Horde Wars]] of the [[1360 DR|Year of the Turret, 1360 DR]], After the war, the Hammerhands decided to resettle in their entirety in Earthfast. This necessitated warring against the local [[goblinoid]]s besieging the city. Therefore, two hundred Hammerhands became mercenaries to gain experience and earn money to support their clan.\n\nArriving in the late 1360s DR, the Hammerhands were much-needed reinforcements for Earthfast. Their assistance gave the dwarves there time to fortify the defenses of [[Alagh Rorncaurak]] before [[1369 DR]].",
        "Organization": "Clan Hammerhand was led by [[Garren Hammerhand]] in the 1360s DR. It included 200 mercenaries.\n\nHammerhand mercenaries cost 5 [[gp]] per person per week, or a portion thereof.",
        "Areas": "While in the process of resettling in Earthfast, Clan Hammerhand remained based in Ravens Bluff.\n\nFor their mercenary trade, they kept offices in Ravens Bluff and [[Tantras]] in the Vast, and in [[Telflamm]] in [[Thesk]]. They mainly operated in the Vast and in the [[Bloodstone Lands]].",
        "Description": "To be distinctive, dwarven mercenaries of Clan Hammerhand decorated their hair and beards with beads, from plain stone to bejeweled [[gold]].",
        "Tactics": "Hammerhand mercenaries were all infantry soldiers, but carried a variety of different weapons, usually [[hammer]]s but also [[battleaxe]]s and [[footman's pick]]s. They were skilled at subterranean maneuvers and sieges.",
