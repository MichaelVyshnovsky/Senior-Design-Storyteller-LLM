        "mainbody": "he Lightfingers were a wealthy and aristocratic family based in Waterdeep during the 15 century DR.The family is described as being \"aristocratic\" and the patriarchs are called \"lord\", but it is never stated that the family became members of the nobility of Waterdeep. The members of the family died out or disappeared during the tenure of Waterdeeps Open Lord Laeral Silverhand when their dealings with devils tore them apart.\nThe family actively sought to collect and flaunt its wealth, from collecting artwork from all over Faerûn to building a massively opulent mansion for themselves. They were also said to enjoy playing pranks, and perhaps as a result, some members had a reputation for being negligent in their duties to the city of Waterdeep. Lastly, they were also known to have many secrets, among which was their contact and dealings with devils.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, the family lived in an opulent mansion within their sprawling Lightfinger Estate in Waterdeeps Sea Ward. This entire estate was almost maze-like, with plenty of hiding places or locations for secrets to be locked away.\nThe city had assigned to the Lightfingers the duty of keeping the peace within their compound and the nearby Sea Ward, which they did with the help of their guards as well as protective water weirds (including the formidable Lightfinger Tempest) and shield guardians.\nThe family was known to have many enemies. Their wealth had come from the spoils of adventuring, and the fact that they were a newly-wealthy family attracted the ire of many members of the established nobility of Waterdeep&mdashnotably the Cassalanters&mdashwho mocked them, gave them nicknames, and even launched covert attacks on them. The Cassalanters in particular were thought to have sent devils to attack the family, perhaps prompting them to make their own infernal deals. However, more dangerous than spiteful nobles were the powerful enemies that the Lightfingers founder had made before establishing the family, notably Jurrgal, a rakshasa.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, the family was bound by an \"eternal\" infernal contract to a pit fiend from Avernus known as Kurgaloth. In exchange for wealth, power, and protection, the Lightfingers pledged to help destroy Waterdeep through a myriad of small but cumulative betrayals.\nThe family was founded by Donovan Lightfinger, a rogue who amassed great wealth&mdashand many enemies&mdashover the course of a respectable adventuring career. He, like his ancestors, had a reputation for starting but not always ending fights all across Faerûn.\nOver time, the family began behaving less like retired adventurers and more like aristocrats, drawing the ire of the citys nobility&mdashespecially those who were also based in the Sea Ward. This led first to mocking names, then to rivalries, and finally to covert hostilities between the Lightfingers and other families. While these fights never became public knowledge, over a generation they escalated to include attacks on the Lightfingers by fiends and slithering trackers.\nAt some point, perhaps driven to protect themselves from predations by the established noble families or perhaps just because Donovans adventuring spoils were finally running out, the Lightfingers began making deals with devils. This included an \"eternal contract\" with Kurgaloth, to whom the family pledged to support nearby threats to Waterdeep in hopes of destabilizing the city. This included distracting the city from attacks by the Burntbone Horde out of Sharpstone Keep, the machinations of Mrolgyets Legion in Frostsilver Mines, the rise of Qholillaroon in the Heartcoil Deeps, and the expansion of Forestfall Fen by the power of Vorazidrar. These deals were detailed on maps and written in fiery ink, and were then concealed among the familys ledgers. The Lightfingers soon gained a reputation for secrets, rightly knowing that if any proof greater than rumors got out about their dealings, it could lead to the loss of their prestige or worse.\nBy the late 15 century DR, the Lightfinger family finished a new and sprawling estate in the Sea Ward where they lived with their servants, although at some point, these servants were all replaced by doppelgangers. Around this time, the current head of the family, Lord Terrathy Lightfinger, tried to back out of the familys deal with Kurgaloth, angering the pit fiend. At the same time, Donovans old enemy, a rakshasa named Jurrgal whom the rogue had defeated in a duel, appeared and attempted to capture Lord Terrathy with a plan to impersonate him and destroy the family from within as revenge. While Terrathy managed to escape, Jurrgal proceeded with his plan to claim his identity.\nNot long after, Jurrgal—who was unaware of the familys contract with Kurgaloth—was confronted by the pit fiend’s minions. They were unable to resolve their different agendas regarding the Lightfingers&mdashwith Kurgaloth wanting them as servants and Jurrgal wanting them dead&mdashso violence soon erupted in the Lightfinger Estate. This drew the attention of Open Lord Laeral Silverhand, who sent adventurers to investigate. They ultimately defeated Jurrgal, banished Kurgaloth back to Avernus, and learned the extent of the Lightfinger familys betrayal. By this time, the plots that the Lightfingers had helped to conceal in Sharpstone Keep, Frostsilver Mines, and Heartcoil Deeps had already been discovered and thwarted by Lady Silverhand and her agents, but it was from Lord Terrathys journal that they learned of the ongoing crisis in Forestfall Fen.\nIn the aftermath of the conflict and with Lord Terrathy still missing, it was declared that the Lightfingers had forfeited their grand estate.\n* Donovan Lightfinger, the familys founder who was a wealthy adventurer.\n* Terrathy Lightfinger, the familys last patriarch who tried to renege on the familys dealings with devils."
