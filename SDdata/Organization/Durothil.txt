House '''Durothil''' was an [[elf|elven]] house. It claimed to be one of the founding houses of the [[gold elf|gold elves]]. It had a reputation for producing excellent warriors and wizards, many of whom joined [[Evermeet]]'s army. The house's estate was a wooden construction in [[Leuthilspar]] that had been magically grown from a grove of trees.

The house crest consisted of a yellow and white portrayal of the head of a [[gold dragon]].
