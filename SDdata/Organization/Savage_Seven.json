They received their tasks from their agent, the lantern-maker Zorth Ulmaril of Presper Street in Waterdeep.\nAround 1357 DR, the Savage Seven killed the giant Tyrus of the Peaks near Mirabar. Before that they protected a merchant caravan to Luskan from bandits hired by a rival Luskan merchant.\nAll seven were human males.\n* Aumrazaum\n* Dzilfar\n* Rhiitel\n* Silvar\n* Thiirus\n* Thiraphel\n* Tlazar"
