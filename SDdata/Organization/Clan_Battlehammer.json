        "mainbody": "Clan Battlehammer was a clan of shield dwarves based in Mithral Hall in the North. They were ruled by a king of Battlehammer blood, until the bloodline was lost with the apparent death of Bruenor Battlehammer and Banak Brawnanvil became king.\nThe original residence of the clan was Mithral Hall, where Gandalug Battlehammer reigned as the First King. However, it was his third son, Bruenor Battlehammer I, who led the thousand dwarves of the clan to Mithral Hall and commenced work on building the Undercity. Gandalug chose him as his successor, the second king. The hall was an underground town and mine, as the mountain was rich in mithral ore.\nMithral Hall was abandoned in the 1100s DR when the shadow dragon Shimmergloom and hordes of duergar claimed the settlement for themselves after the dwarves in Mithral Hall dug too deep in search for mithral and disturbed the dragon. Only a small number of the clan escaped, including young Bruenor.\nThe survivors of Mithral Hall migrated away, the majority ultimately settling in a valley in front of Kelvins Cairn in Icewind Dale. They created a new home for themselves in the dale, where they remained for two centuries. They traded dwarven-made equipment to the Ten Towns.\nIn the , Bruenor Battlehammer returned to Mithral Hall.\nIn the , Bruenor abdicated his throne to Gandalug, the founder of Mithral Hall who had returned from the dead, making him both First and Ninth King of Mithral Hall. Bruenor took a few hundred of his dwarves back to Icewind Dale, but when Gandalug died, he returned in the , to rule as the Tenth King of Mithral Hall.\nHowever, a few dwarves remained in the mines in Icewind Dale. Circa 1483 DR, they were led by Stokely Silverstream.\nthumb|250px|A hammer and a shield with the Battlehammer symbol upon it.\n# Gandalug Battlehammer\n# Bruenor Battlehammer I\n# Unknown\n# Unknown\n# Unknown\n# Garumn Battlehammer\n# Bangor Battlehammer\n# Bruenor Battlehammer II, 1356 DR – 1362 DR\n# Gandalug Battlehammer (reinstated), 1362 DR – 1370 DR\n# Bruenor Battlehammer II (reinstated), 1370 DR – 1409 DR\n# Banak Brawnanvil, 1409 DR\n# Connerad Brawnanvil, 1445 DR Died retaking Gauntlgrym.\n# Dagnabbet Waybeard, 1486 DR – onward first queen.\nMany dwarves and individuals from other races were allied with Clan Battlehammer, most famously Drizzt DoUrden."
