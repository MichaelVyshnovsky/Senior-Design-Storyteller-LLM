The '''Riders of Mistledale''' were a group of thirty mounted militia in [[Mistledale]], in the [[Dalelands]].

==Organization==
They were rarely formed into one single unit, but regularly undertook patrols, with three to four riders being accompanied by ten or twenty mounted troops.

==Equipment==
The Riders would use black lacquered [[plate mail]] armor and a black helm, which displayed the white horse motif of Mistledale.

==Headquarters==
As of 1372 DR, the [[Barracks of the Riders]] was located at the north of the town of [[Ashabenford]], in Mistledale. It was a walled compound with a courtyard used for training, and a small keephouse that was used as a jail.

==Hierarchy==
The leader of the Council of Six, the ruling council of Mistledale, was also the leader of the Riders of Mistledale. Between [[1367 DR|1367]] and [[1372 DR]], this was [[Haresk Malorn]].

The Captain was the military leader of the Riders of Mistledale, in contrast to the high councilor's role as commander. The position of Swordar was second-in-command to the Captain. In the 1330s DR, there was only one Swordar position, but in later years, there might have been as many as three Swordars at one time.{{Cite web/Candlekeep forum/Questions for Ed Greenwood (2011)/Captain Baergil}}
