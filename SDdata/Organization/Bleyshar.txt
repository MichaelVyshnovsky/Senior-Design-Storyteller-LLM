==History==
In the year [[1479 DR]], there were only two surviving Bleyshars: Shalice Bleyshar and her nephew Tantram. Shalice was both feeble and old, while her nephew was eager to assume full control of the family wealth upon her death. Shalice had not left the family mansion west of Gray Oaks ([[Bleys Hard]]) for at least two decades.
