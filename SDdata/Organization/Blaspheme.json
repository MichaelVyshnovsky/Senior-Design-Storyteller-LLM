        "mainbody": "The Blaspheme was a rebel udadrow group of former driders who fought against the clergy of Lolth in Menzoberranzan in the late 15th century DR.\nThe Blaspheme were led by Malavoselle Amvas Tol, who had led the drider contingent in the Demonweb Pits.\nThe Yochlols Yiccardaria and Eskavidne initially summoned the driders who would come to form the bulk of the Blaspheme from the Demonweb Pits in the  as an army to gift to Matron Zhindia Melarn so as to foment chaos among the drow of Menzoberranzan, making it look like Zhindia enjoyed the favor of Lolth in greater proportion than any other of the citys matrons, while also tipping the balance of temporal power in the city in her houses favor.\nWhen Zhindias forces were about to clash with those of House Baenre and its allies on the surface, a magical trap had been set up, empowered by the birth magic sent out by Catti-brie during the birth of her daughter. When any drider stepped through this trap, they were painfully transformed back into humanoid drow. Seeing the opportunity after the first transformations, all of the other driders present on the battlefield, from both armies, willingly entered the trap, transforming themselves back into their original drow forms. After the battle swiftly concluded, the identities of the newly-transformed drow were recorded and all armies returned home, taking the former driders with them.\nOnce in Menzoberranzan, the former driders began fighting against the Lolthites in the city, in a conflict expected to take years, if not decades to resolve.\nDinin DoUrden, the half-brother of Drizzt DoUrden was a member. Though he initially assumed an alias of a houseless male named Dininae to avoid being recognized as such."
