        "mainbody": "The '''Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge''' was an [[orc]] monastic order dedicated to the [[Orc pantheon|orcish god]] [[Yurtrus]].{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|7}}",
        "Activities": "The [[monks]] of the Brotherhood were known to bleach their hands white They also grew out their fingernails, and prior to battle, would dip these long nails into a [[poison]] made of blood infected with [[red ache]], allowing them to infect their opponents with the [[disease]].\n\nSome of the monks also served as [[cleric]]s of Yurtrus.",
        "History": "The Brotherhood was founded in the {{YearlinkName|927}}, by [[Wund]], an orc [[shaman]], who accurately predicted and capitalized on Yurtrus's [[Blood Plagues]] of that year to become the religious leader of the orcs of the [[Sword Mountains]]. The Brotherhood's aim was to spiritually unite the orcs, and it became a driving force behind Wund's plans for the new orc kingdom of [[Uruth Ukrypt]].\n\nThe Brotherhood was the backbone of Uruth Ukrypt, and remained influential beyond Wund's death. In the {{YearlinkName|1024}}, after a band of [[adventurer]]s from [[Waterdeep]] called the [[Dawnbringer Company]] plundered the Brotherhood's sacred [[Ukrypt]] tomb, the Brotherhood raised an Uruth Ukrypt horde&mdash;dubbed the [[Broken Bone]]&mdash;with the goal to inflict payback on Waterdeep. However, their horde was defeated by Waterdeep with the help of the [[bronze dragon]] [[Lhammaruntosz]]. The Brotherhood tried again to destroy Waterdeep two years later in the {{YearlinkName|1026}}, when they raised another horde&mdash;the [[Black Claw]]s&mdash;but they were once again defeated. Following this second major loss, both Uruth Ukrypt and the Brotherhood fell apart. Nevertheless, the Brotherhood persisted through the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] as an order of monks dedicated to Yurtrus."
