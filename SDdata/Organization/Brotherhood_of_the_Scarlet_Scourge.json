        "mainbody": "The Brotherhood of the Scarlet Scourge was an orc monastic order dedicated to the orcish god Yurtrus.\nThe monks of the Brotherhood were known to bleach their hands white They also grew out their fingernails, and prior to battle, would dip these long nails into a poison made of blood infected with red ache, allowing them to infect their opponents with the disease.\nSome of the monks also served as clerics of Yurtrus.\nThe Brotherhood was founded in the , by Wund, an orc shaman, who accurately predicted and capitalized on Yurtruss Blood Plagues of that year to become the religious leader of the orcs of the Sword Mountains. The Brotherhoods aim was to spiritually unite the orcs, and it became a driving force behind Wunds plans for the new orc kingdom of Uruth Ukrypt.\nThe Brotherhood was the backbone of Uruth Ukrypt, and remained influential beyond Wunds death. In the , after a band of adventurers from Waterdeep called the Dawnbringer Company plundered the Brotherhoods sacred Ukrypt tomb, the Brotherhood raised an Uruth Ukrypt horde&mdashdubbed the Broken Bone&mdashwith the goal to inflict payback on Waterdeep. However, their horde was defeated by Waterdeep with the help of the bronze dragon Lhammaruntosz. The Brotherhood tried again to destroy Waterdeep two years later in the , when they raised another horde&mdashthe Black Claws&mdashbut they were once again defeated. Following this second major loss, both Uruth Ukrypt and the Brotherhood fell apart. Nevertheless, the Brotherhood persisted through the mid-to-late 14 century DR as an order of monks dedicated to Yurtrus."
