The Silver Ravens are the personal army created and utilized by Miklos Selkirk. Among their goals are to gather information, attain magical items and generally improve the image of Sembia abroad. It is for this reason that when Silver Ravens are working abroad they hide the coat-of-arms typically worn only while in Sembian lands.
Miklos sees the Ravens as his answer to the Harpers, with whom Sembia has regularly clashed. While he encourages paladins and other honorable fighters to join their ranks, he knows that the reality they might need to undertake some dishonorable deeds to accomplish their goals. Ultimately though, all Miklos requires that his agents hold their loyalty to Sembia.
