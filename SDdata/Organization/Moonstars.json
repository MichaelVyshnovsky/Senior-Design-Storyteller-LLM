        "mainbody": "The '''Moonstars''', also known as the '''Tel'Teukiira''', the '''Silverstars''', or the '''Twelvestars''', were a highly secretive group of individuals formed by [[Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]] with the aim of unifying the [[human]]s and other races (especially [[elves]]) against the forces of evil.",
        "Outlook": "The Moonstars sought to preserve life and knowledge. They had a similar outlook to the [[Harpers]], but dedicated themselves to [[Mystra]], [[Oghma]], and [[Sehanine Moonbow]].",
        "Prophecy": "A passage from [[Amagal's Tome]] (an ancient elven text from [[Cormanthor]]) declared:\n{{Quote|''The Tel'Teukiira will come hidden and in many guises and faces. They dwell in shadow and speak in omens, yet they shall bring about waking dreams and save us from the Three Threats Who Wait in Darkness, the Prefects, and ourselves.''}}\nIt was believed that only Khelben understood the relevance of these words.",
        "Activities": "Based in [[Waterdeep]], the Moonstars followed much the same methods as the Harpers did, though the Moonstars operated in more secrecy than the Harpers and members were less free to do what they wanted, being under the direct and relatively strict command of the Blackstaff himself. Officially, the group's headquarters was [[Blackstaff Tower]], though very few even visited that prestigious place. Each member carried a badge that allowed them access to their real stronghold, [[Silver Safehold]], which was an extraplanar stronghold built by the [[Storm Heralds]] of [[Cormyr]].\n\nOf the gods who pledged their support to the Harpers, only three also supported the Moonstars: [[Mystra]], [[Oghma]], and [[Sehanine Moonbow]]. But even with the lack of the other Harper gods' blessings, Khelben and Laeral made up for it with their own spells.\n\nTo aid them in their quests to vanquish evil, the Moonstars had several permanent ''[[portal]]s'' scattered around Faer√ªn to allow quick passage.{{Cite web/Perilous Gateways/Portals of the Moonstars}}",
        "History": {
            "Post-Spellplague": "[[Renaer Neverember]] revived the Moonstars in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, after [[Vajra Safahr]] assumed the title \"Blackstaff\". However, the group decided they did not want to carry the Moonstars' legacy, so they planned on creating a new organization that would be friends rather than agents of the Blackstaff. The organization's name was not decided at their first meeting.\n\nIn the month of [[Eleint]], the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, a [[moon elf]] [[mage]] and Moonstar named [[Questele]] was primarily responsible for defending [[Stedd Whitehorn]], the boy [[Chosen]] of [[Lathander]]. She died trying to protect him.\n\nMoonstar sleeper agents became active players in Waterdeep, [[Candlekeep]], and [[Myth Drannor]] during the [[Second Sundering]], but went underground after the conflict passed. It was unknown to outsiders what the relationship was between the Moonstars and the Harpers, or [[Lords of Waterdeep|Open Lord]] Laeral Silverhand or Vajra Safahr for that matter."
