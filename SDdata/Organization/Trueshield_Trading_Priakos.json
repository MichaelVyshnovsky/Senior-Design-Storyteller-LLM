The first edition ''[[Forgotten Realms Campaign Set]]'' states on page 62 of the ''Cyclopedia of the Realms'' that, in [[1357 DR]], the Trueshield Trading Priakos had been in business for eight seasons, putting the founding date at [[1349 DR]]. This same \"eight seasons\" interval propagated to other publications that covered more recent dates, like the [[Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting 2nd edition (revised)|second edition campaign setting]], until it was stated to be 1359 DR in ''[[Power of Faerûn]]''.",
