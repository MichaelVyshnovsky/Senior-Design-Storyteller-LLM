        "mainbody": "The '''Church of Tempus''' was the collective group of individuals that called upon [[Tempus]] the god of war as their patron deity. It was one of the most prolific religions in the Realms, and one that attracted people from all walks of life Its members engaged many wars without specific affiliation to one government or another.\n\n{{Quote|The sun rises out of blood and sets into blood, and all the time between belongs to the Lord of Battles.|Official saying of Tempus' church.}}",
        "Organization": {
            "Titles": "Befitting an organization that extolled the virtues of warfare, the church bestowed upon its members military-style ranks and titles. Clergy members often referred to one another as 'Hammers', a name derived from the saying: \"the small, hammering hands of the Foehammer\".\n\nAs of the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], these included, in descending order: Lord/Lady of the Field, Swordmaster/mistress, Battlelord/lady, Shield of the God, Lance of the Lord, Terrible Sword, Swung Sword, and Warpriest. Higher rank could be achieved by distinct service to the church, when necessary in times of need, or temporarily when it was deemed necessary.\n\nAdditional titles associated with a specific role in the church were put in these ranks when appropriate. The title of Warlyon, or Trusted Sword, was bestowed upon the heads of Tempus' temples and Arahar, or Battle Chaplain, was give to clergy members that oversaw his shrines. \n\n''Circa'' the late 15{{th}} century, the title of Direhar was used for guardian-priests, Rauthar for swordmasters, Hardhar for warrior-priests, and Stalwart for other priests."
        },
        "Activities": "The faithful of Tempus aided anyone or group that had genuine need to engage in battle, regardless of affiliation. but would not act as commanders or generals-for-hire. Rather they strived to maintain honor, respect, and professionalism among the combatants of battles, including those in which they participated. \n\nTempus' clergy made great efforts to help predominantly [[human]] societies prepare for war, with a focus on mustering defenses against terrifying creatures or [[:Category:Monstrous humanoids|monstrous humanoids]].\n\nOn occasion, the church led crusades against other groups or entities whose actions threatened their institution. These great and terrible campaigns were described by some as \"a civilized man's barbarian horde\".\n\nWhen not instructing or supporting others in the arts of war, offering prayers to Tempus or otherwise engaging in warfare themselves, Tempuran clergy spent much of their time in training in preparation for their next battle.\n\nThe most mighty of Tempus' priests could magically imbue weaponry and armor with the consciousness of retired and elderly once-great warriors. This could be witnessed in the construction of some [[helmed horror]]s found across [[Faerûn]].",
        "Rituals": "One of the most common Tempuran rituals was the prayer calling for bravery and self-preservation invoked before battle, or the night before battle. [[Cleric]]s specifically prayed for their [[divine magic|divine spell]]s before Highsun every day.\n\nAdditionally, clergy members held the Feast of Heroes at Highsun each day,  and performed the Song for the Fallen as the [[sun]] began to set. At some temples, high priests would perform a ceremony entitled the Song of the Sword for Tempus' faithful worshipers.\n\nAll followers to Tempus were expected to spill blood—either their own or that of an enemy combatant—at least once per [[tenday]].",
        "Celebrations": "Once each year, during the [[Feast of the Moon]] following [[Uktar]], priests of Tempus from across the Realms began the [[March of the Dead]] in their nearby settlements. During this ceremony, priests would list the names of the fallen dead in a chant as they walked through town or throughout the city streets.\n\nTwo famous battles were celebrated locally among Tempus' faithful in the Dalelands, the [[Battle of Ambrose's Fall]] on [[Uktar 7]], and the [[Battle of Swords Creek]] on [[Flamerule 17]].\n\nOn occasion, some of the larger temples would host grand athletic competitions known as \"champion frays\".",

            "Places of Worship": "Temples dedicated to the Lord of Battle tended to resemble military fortresses rather than actual places of worship. Shrines were often adorned with shattered weapons, damaged armor, or even the heads of recently-slain monsters.\n\nAn altar to Tempus was also set up within each temple of the [[Red Knight]].",

            "Dress": "Tempus' clergy typically wore the same [[armor]] they would don on the battlefield— The quality of their armor depended on their rank. High-ranking Warlyon priests wore [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[plate mail]] decorated with filigree, while battle-chaplain Arahars wore [[splint mail]], and lesser priests wore simple [[chainmail]]. They always took care to never wear helms or headgear that covered their face however, that was considered profane emulation of Tempus' likeness. \n\nSome of the more zealous orders of the church always kept at least one piece of armor on their bodies at all times. This practice was less common among Tempuran clergy found in larger cities.\n\nPriests' [[robe]]s varied in color depending on rank, from brown and purple worn by lesser priests to red and amber worn by high priests. Yellow and white robes were only to be worn by the most esteemed of Tempus' priests. The robes of all priests were adorned in red trim, dyed with actual blood.",

        "Dogma": {
            "Beliefs": "Followers of Tempus believed their god did not achieve victory in war, rather provided aid for those that were deserving of it. Warfare was a natural force of the world, the great equalizer of the mortals of the Realms. For during battle, any mortal could be just as easily slain as they could achieve greatness and glory.\n\nThey believed Tempus honored those that engaged in honorable warfare and did not succumb to cowardly or shameful tactics such as terrorizing innocents, performing torture, utilizing [[poison]]s, or committing outright slaughter.\n\nWhile in battle, Tempuran faithful often called out the names of their fellow clergymen that had previously been slain, or otherwise were forced to retire from a life of active combat.",
            "Attitudes": "{{Quote|(you should) disparage no foe and respect all, for valor blazes in all, regardless of age, gender, or race.|Excerpt of the Tempuran dogma.}}\n\nWhile they were stalwart in their beliefs, and would readily defend their faith in battle, Tempus' clergy did not engage in war without reason, or when they felt there was no chance of victory. A swift, decisive battle was much more preferable over a long, drawn-out engagement. They felt the consequences of engaging in war should be carefully considered before initiating the first battle. At the same time, those that attempted to avoid conflict, either by fleeing or attempts at parlay, were cowards among the most harmful to all of civilization.\n\nWorshipers of Tempus always honored the dead that fell in battles past. Their names were to be recorded after every battle, for future inclusion in the [[Church of Tempus#Celebrations|March of the Dead]]. Gratuitous destruction was never acceptable under any circumstances."

            "Military Orders": "* [[Order of the Broken Blade]], a order composed of former Tempuran warriors and other clergy that were unable to effectively fight in battle.\n* [[Order of the Steel Fang]], an elite fighting group often dispatched by the church to the deadliest assignments across the Realms."

        "Classes": "The church of Tempus attracted numerous [[cleric]]s, [[crusader]]s, specialty priests, known as [[battleguard]]s, or [[gloryblood]]s, and in some locales, even tribal [[shaman]]s. It also attracted some number of [[barbarian]]s, [[fighter]]s, and even some [[divine champion]]s within its ranks.",
        "Relationships": "Distinct conflict arose between Tempus' [[Waterdhavian]] clergy and the city's [[Church of Shar|worshipers of Shar]].\n\nFollowing the decline of the [[Untheric pantheon]], the Tempuran church maintained a rivalrous relationship with the [[church of Anhur]]. Each organization competed with one another for faithful that sought to venerate a patron of martial combat.\n\nThe church's dogma was diametrically opposed to that of the [[church of Eldath|Eldath's faithful]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1345}}, Waterdhavian clergy of Tempus engaged in a brief religious conflict with the churches of [[church of Shar|Shar]], [[church of Lathander|Lathander]], and [[Church of Selûne|Selûne]].\n\nClerics of Tempus fought alongside local Dalesfolk when Battledale came under threat of occupation by the [[drow]] of [[Clan Auzkovyn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}.",
