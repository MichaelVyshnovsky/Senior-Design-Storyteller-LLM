        "mainbody": "The '''Glarondan cell''' was a cell of the [[Cult of the Dragon]] based in the village of [[Glarondar]] in [[Aglarond]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Operating in secret and led by the [[necromancer]] [[Winn Kardzen]], the Cult members of this cell revered the [[fang dragon]] [[Nartheling]], who made his lair on [[Umbergoth Peak]]. Winn and his cultists periodically made expeditions up Umbergoth Peak to deliver information on affairs in the village and on local caravans and patrols Nartheling could attack and take treasure from, while persuading him to accept transformation into a [[dracolich]].\n\nKardzen was also laying plans for a joint attack on the Glarondar fortress. To this end, he was raising [[undead]] from the [[Umber Marshes]] to fake an attack from [[Thay]] to draw away patrols from the [[Watchwall]], thus allowing Nartheling to tear apart Glarondar untroubled by its defenders.",
        "History": "[[File:Grail of Shargrailar.jpg|thumb|right|''The much sought-after ''Grail of Shargrailar''.'']]\nIn the early 1370s DR, Winn was on the verge of sealing the deal with Nartheling and sought a [[phylactery]] worthy of the [[dragon]]'s essence, finding the ''[[Grail of Shargrailar]]'', formed from a horn of the fallen [[red dragon]] [[Shargrailar]], the first and most powerful dracolich. After his agents obtained the ''Grail'' and shipped it to [[Velprintalar]], ''circa'' [[1372 DR]], Winn hired the merchant [[Tulin Farweather]] to transport it to his village, so as not to attract unwanted attention. However, it was lost ''en route''. Kardzen and the Cult would try to search for and recover the lost horn, but the ''Grail''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> fate is unknown."
