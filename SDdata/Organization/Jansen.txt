The Jansens were a family of gnomes that lived across the west coast of Faerûn during the 14 century DR.
While members of the family held a number of professions, including inventors, adventurers, criminals, performers, and herbalists, their primary interests were in the cultivation and use of turnips.
The Amnian Jansens were a diverse and eccentric group of gnomes.
Among them were the siblings and siblings-in-law
* Jan Jansen, an inventor and adventurer who lived in Athkatla
* Elgar Buttercup, Jans brother, whose skin was supposedly made of charcoal
* Burt Wonderkind, the griffon-baiter
Their cousins
* Glandig, who had twins named Tot and Tat
* Josephine, who became involved with a "gully dwarf"
* Beeloo, another cousin who had a history of run–ins with the law
* Richard, an uncle who tried to make nude theater popular in Waterdeep
* Kylie Jansen, a turnip peddler from Athkatla
* Tat and Tot Jansen, twins from Athkatla
The aunts and uncles
* Sara, who attempted to take over the world with turnip pies laced with psychogenic herbs
* Gerhardt, who despite his incoherent ramblings was somehow privy to the activities of the Hidden
* Hans Jansen, a great-uncle who was an accomplished alchemist
* Furnbottom Jansen, an aging adventurer whose career was ended by a hungry griffon
As well as
* Yanna Jojannsen, Jan Jansens niece, who was charmed by the vampire Hexxat and died while searching for the tomb of Dragomir
* Eduardo, an inventor whose creations were displayed in Waukeens Promenade
The "Culver Jansens" were those from the family who were exiled from Thunder Mountain and settled in the city of Culver.

According to their family the city of Culver has not existed since the "great Turnip Famine of 45".
