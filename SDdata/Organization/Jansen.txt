The '''Jansens''' were a family of [[gnome]]s that lived across the west coast of [[Faerûn]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
While members of the family held a number of professions, including inventors, adventurers, criminals, performers, and herbalists, their primary interests were in the cultivation and use of [[turnip]]s.

==Members==
The Amnian Jansens were a diverse and eccentric group of gnomes.

Among them were the siblings and siblings-in-law;
* [[Jan Jansen]], an inventor and adventurer who lived in [[Athkatla]]
* Elgar Buttercup, Jan's brother, whose skin was supposedly made of charcoal
* Burt Wonderkind, the griffon-baiter

Their cousins;
* Glandig, who had twins named Tot and Tat
* Josephine, who became involved with a "gully [[dwarf]]"
* Beeloo, another cousin who had a history of run–ins with the law
* Richard, an uncle who tried to make nude theater popular in [[Waterdeep]]
* [[Kylie Jansen]], a turnip peddler from Athkatla
* [[Tat Jansen|Tat]] and [[Tot Jansen]], twins from Athkatla

The aunts and uncles:
* Sara, who attempted to take over the world with turnip pies laced with psychogenic [[herb]]s
* Gerhardt, who despite his incoherent ramblings was somehow privy to the activities of the [[Hidden (person)|Hidden]]
* Hans Jansen, a great-uncle who was an accomplished [[alchemist]]
* [[Furnbottom Jansen]], an aging adventurer whose career was ended by a hungry [[griffon]]

As well as:
* Yanna Jojannsen, Jan Jansen's niece, who was ''charmed'' by the [[vampire]] [[Hexxat]] and died while searching for the tomb of [[Dragomir]]
* [[Eduardo Jansen|Eduardo]], an inventor whose creations were displayed in [[Waukeen's Promenade]]

The "Culver Jansens" were those from the family who were exiled from [[Thunder Mountain]] and settled in the city of [[Waterdeep|Culver]].

* Uncle Pinto, who sold the rights of Culver for a bag of turnips
* [[Erb Jansen|Erb]], a courtesan and former chest-maker who settled in the city of [[Neverwinter]]

==History==
According to their family the city of Culver has not existed since the "great Turnip Famine of '45".
