Scantshar was the name of a prominent human family in the hamlet of Sevenecho in the Vast in the 1360s DR.
The Scantshar family was distrusted and treated with slight suspicion by other village folk. This was largely due to the fact that the family matriarch, Riliyyn Scantshar, was a wizard of some accomplishment.
As one of the more prominent families, the Scantshars also contributed a member to the council of elders that governed Sevenecho, around 1369 DR.Given her seniority and authority, Riliyyn Scantshar may be this member of this council of elders.
