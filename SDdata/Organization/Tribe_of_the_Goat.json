        "mainbody": "The '''Tribe of the Goat''' was a nomadic group of [[Reghedman]] [[barbarians]] that dwelled within the tundra of [[Icewind Dale]] before becoming allied with [[archdevil]] [[Levistus]] and being spirited away to [[Stygia]], the fifth layer of [[Baator]]. The Tribe of the Goat was said to have been dwelling in Stygia for thousands of years by the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].\n{{Quote|''The Reghed tribes have grown weak while we've been gone. When this is over, the Goat tribe will rule them all.''|Justgoat Raider}}",
        "Culture": "Despite being permanently tainted by the [[lower planes]], the Goat tribespeople were a lot like their Icewind Dale kin. They valued battle prowess and strength in combat above all else. However, these values were hardened and twisted under the whips of their [[fiend]] masters.",
        "History": "The Tribe of the Goat's history was largely lost to the ages as well as the events that led to the tribe becoming bound to Levistus's service. Sages believed that it was the result of some infernal bargain that ensured the Reghedmen would spend \"thousands of years\" in hellish servitude. Leaders of the tribe still remembered their history and the tribe's original name. They claimed that the Tribe of the Goat was brought to Stygia during the event called the [[Netheril Gambit]], after being caught on the northern lands claimed by Stygia during [[The Transference]]. The Transference also caught a number of [[frost giant]]s, who eventually became known as [[Stygian giant]]s, as well as [[remorhaz]]es, [[mammoth]]s, and [[snowy owlbear]]s.\n\nIn Levistus's grasp, the Tribe of the Goat proved itself on the battlefronts on [[Avernus]] and, as a result, they were gifted with limited magical abilities that would allow them to rise in the Stygian hierarchy. As a part of Levistus's army, the [[barbarian]]s became known as the Goat Raiders, or simply \"justgoats.\"\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1356}}, Levistus was among several malicious parties that became aware of the legendary [[artifact]] ''[[Crenshinibon]]'s'' resurfacing in Icewind Dale, following the war against the army of [[Akar Kessell]]. The archdevil dispatched many members of his justgoats back \"home\" in order to retrieve the crystal. Those hell-twisted barbarians who were sent to [[Toril]] celebrated the return and planned on eventually taking the frigid land away from their soft and weak kin."
