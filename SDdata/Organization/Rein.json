        "mainbody": "The '''Rein''' family were a wealthy and controversial family based in the city of [[Loudwater]] in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were owners of the [[Red Boar Inn]], [[Red Boar Trading Coster]], and other ventures in the [[Delimbiyr Vale]].{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/A Fellowship Rises}}",
        "History": "Hailing from [[Waterdeep]], the Rein family settled in Loudwater in the 1310s [[DR]] For lumber, they cut down a massive [[oak]] tree that had been growing on the siteâ€”a tragic act that would anger the local [[elves]] for decades to come. Nevertheless, a remnant of this oak was used as the main pillar in the common room and not long after it was built, the pillar came to be used as a community notice board.<ref group=\"note\">''Key to Phantoms' Cloister'' and ''Rat's Bastard'' say the Reins felled the oak \"a century or so ago\" from a setting date of 1372 DR, but the [[Legacy of the Green Regent]] background article \"A Fellowship Rises\" says this was \"almost sixty winters ago\". The later date is presumed here, as it is more exact and \"a century or so\" could conceivably encompass 60 years.\n\nThe Reins would prosper and later led the Red Boar Trading Coster.\n\nIn the summer of the {{yearlinkName|1369}}, the people of the neighboring town of [[Orlbar]] revolted against the tyrannical rule of the [[Zhentarim]] that had seized control of their town, and they were backed by Loudwater. But Jesym Rein turned traitor to both the Orlbar rebels and the Loudwater soldiers, and thanks to her, the Zhentarim and [[cleric]]s of [[Iyachtu Xvim]] brutally crushed the rebellion and Loudwater was forced to sign the [[Oath of Orlbar]], a peace treaty that marked a border between the two states in the years after. <ref> Her actions tarnished the Rein name with a reputation for treachery.\n\nHowever, their reputation was soon healed in only the autumn of that year. At that time, Stedd Rein returned from the [[College of War]] in [[Athkatla]], and while he was still ''en route'' to Loudwater, Deldron departed the city to greet his son and conduct business in [[Daggerford]], taking the Red Boar Trading Coster's sizeable guard with him. But a magical communication from Loudwater alerted Deldron about a vicious [[lycanthrope]] attack, known as the [[Night of the Blood Moon]], and the Reins and their Red Boar guard hastened to return. Arriving in time to aid in the third day of fighting, Stedd Rein displayed courage and leadership and his actions saved many lives, and he earned praise and accolades. It improved the Rein name, erasing the earlier memory of Jesym's treachery{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/What is the Green Regent}}",
        "Possessions": "The Reins continued to own the Red Boar Inn, but left it to be managed by others.\n\nThe Rein family owned a pair of [[coaster]]s that operated between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Baldur's Gate]].<ref>{{Cite web/Legacy of the Green Regent/Dispel Confusion Issue 1}}",
        "Relationships": "Despite Stedd's heroism, Jesym's betrayal was not forgotten, and in the early 1370s DR there were still some in Loudwater who believed the Reins would ultimately prove treacherous and must be kept an eye on. <ref> The nine great elven families of Loudwater in particular typically opposed anything to do with the Reins, though the [[Beutaleen'dal]]s eventually supported them.",
        "Description": "[[Beyvan Keth|Some]] thought the Reins had \"great fashion sense\".<ref>",
        "Notable Members": "* [[Deldron Rein]], family patriarch ''circa'' [[1370 DR]], owner of the Red Boar Inn and Red Boar Trading Coster.\n* [[Jesym Rein]], a traitor to Loudwater, a hero to the Zhentarim and followers of Iyachtu Xvim.\n* [[Stedd Rein]], hero of the [[Night of the Blood Moon]]."
