        "mainbody": "he Rein family were a wealthy and controversial family based in the city of Loudwater in the Delimbiyr Vale in the 14 century DR. They were owners of the Red Boar Inn, Red Boar Trading Coster, and other ventures in the Delimbiyr Vale.\nHailing from Waterdeep, the Rein family settled in Loudwater in the 1310s DR For lumber, they cut down a massive oak tree that had been growing on the siteâ€”a tragic act that would anger the local elves for decades to come. Nevertheless, a remnant of this oak was used as the main pillar in the common room and not long after it was built, the pillar came to be used as a community notice board.Key to Phantoms Cloister and Rats Bastard say the Reins felled the oak \"a century or so ago\" from a setting date of 1372 DR, but the Legacy of the Green Regent background article \"A Fellowship Rises\" says this was \"almost sixty winters ago\". The later date is presumed here, as it is more exact and \"a century or so\" could conceivably encompass 60 years.\nThe Reins would prosper and later led the Red Boar Trading Coster.\nIn the summer of the , the people of the neighboring town of Orlbar revolted against the tyrannical rule of the Zhentarim that had seized control of their town, and they were backed by Loudwater. But Jesym Rein turned traitor to both the Orlbar rebels and the Loudwater soldiers, and thanks to her, the Zhentarim and clerics of Iyachtu Xvim brutally crushed the rebellion and Loudwater was forced to sign the Oath of Orlbar, a peace treaty that marked a border between the two states in the years after.  Her actions tarnished the Rein name with a reputation for treachery.\nHowever, their reputation was soon healed in only the autumn of that year. At that time, Stedd Rein returned from the College of War in Athkatla, and while he was still en route to Loudwater, Deldron departed the city to greet his son and conduct business in Daggerford, taking the Red Boar Trading Costers sizeable guard with him. But a magical communication from Loudwater alerted Deldron about a vicious lycanthrope attack, known as the Night of the Blood Moon, and the Reins and their Red Boar guard hastened to return. Arriving in time to aid in the third day of fighting, Stedd Rein displayed courage and leadership and his actions saved many lives, and he earned praise and accolades. It improved the Rein name, erasing the earlier memory of Jesyms treachery\nThe Reins continued to own the Red Boar Inn, but left it to be managed by others.\nThe Rein family owned a pair of coasters that operated between Waterdeep and Baldurs Gate.\nDespite Stedds heroism, Jesyms betrayal was not forgotten, and in the early 1370s DR there were still some in Loudwater who believed the Reins would ultimately prove treacherous and must be kept an eye on.  The nine great elven families of Loudwater in particular typically opposed anything to do with the Reins, though the Beutaleendals eventually supported them.\nSome thought the Reins had \"great fashion sense\".\n* Deldron Rein, family patriarch circa 1370 DR, owner of the Red Boar Inn and Red Boar Trading Coster.\n* Jesym Rein, a traitor to Loudwater, a hero to the Zhentarim and followers of Iyachtu Xvim.\n* Stedd Rein, hero of the Night of the Blood Moon."
