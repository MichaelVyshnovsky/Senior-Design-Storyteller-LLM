The '''Fellowship of Poetic Justices''' was an order of [[bard]]s and [[crusader]]s who worshiped either [[Hoar]], the Lord of Three Thunders, or [[Tyr]], the Even-Handed.

==Base of Operations==
The Fellowship of Poetic Justices was active throughout [[Faerûn]].

==Activities==
The order was founded during the aftermath of the [[Time of Troubles]]. Members of this group sought to spread stories of ironic justice wherever they travelled, hoping to achieve through their tales what violence failed to accomplish. They were supported by [[cleric]]s of both faiths.
