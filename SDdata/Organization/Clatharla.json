        "mainbody": "House Clatharla was a noble elven house.While House Clatharla is never implied to be elven, the Srinshee guards over their treasures in the Vault of Ages. She claims to know the history of every object in the vault as it refers to their people, and the Vault is supposed to hold elven possessions above all. Thus, given that the Eye is stored with other elven possessions and that the Srinshee knows and relates its tale without making reference to them not being elves, this article is written under the assumption that House Clatharla was elven.\nBy the , House Clatharla was defunct. Prior to their dissolution, the Dowsing Eye of House Clatharla was created for them."
