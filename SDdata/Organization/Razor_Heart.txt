The '''Razor Heart''' tribe was the most powerful of the [[goblinoid]] clans of the [[Giantspire Mountains]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The clan charged a toll&mdash;which they referred to as a "tax"&mdash;on all travelers passing through the [[Giantspire Gap]].

==Possessions==
The Razor Heart tribe boasted possession of one of the ''[[Crowns of Whispers]]'' as well as of the ''[[Greatsword of Impiltur]]''.

==Relationships==
The tribe had diplomatic ties to the Kingdom of [[Damara]]. They clashed with the [[Blood Mountain]] tribe over control of the Giantspire Gap, and with the [[Black Wolf (tribe)|Black Wolf]] tribe to the south.

==History==
Prior to the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the hobgoblin forebears of Razor Heart served the [[succubus]] [[demon lord]] [[Soneillon]]. When she was banished from [[Toril]] because of the [[Spellplague]], she left behind the two ''Crowns of Whispers'' and the ''Greatsword of Impiltur'', which were claimed by her former servants. One of the ''Crowns'' as well as the ''Greatsword'' both came into the possession of the Razor Heart tribe.

In the late 15{{th}} century DR, under the leadership of their queen, [[Maaqua]], the Razor Heart tribe managed to establish ties with [[Damara]], granting it a veneer of legitimate rule and enabling it to charge a tax on travelers along the [[Long Road (Northeast Faer√ªn)|Long Road]] through the Giantspire Gap. At the same time, the tribe was steadily expanding throughout the Giantspires by assimilating other goblinoid tribes. Their greatest resistance came from the Black Wolf tribe, whose Chief [[Aruugan]] possessed the other ''Crown of Whispers''.

==Members==
The queen of the Razor Heart tribe was Maaqua as of the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. It was a mixed tribe of not only hobgoblins, but [[goblin]]s, [[ogre]]s, and even [[giant]]s.
