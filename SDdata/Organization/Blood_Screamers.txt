The '''Blood Screamers''' were a savage and bloodthirsty pack of [[dire animal|dire]] [[weremole]] [[gnome]]s led by a [[gnome vampire]] known as the [[Blood-Curdling Scream]], active in [[southwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]]. All were priests of [[Urdlen]], the Evil One.

The Blood Screamers were based in the [[Bandit Wastes]] of [[Lapaliiya]] and were the worst of the outlaws there. They launched raids from the [[Nathaghal Mountains]] and all the way to the [[Nath]] in [[Halruaa]] and to the [[Rathgaunt Hills]] at the end of the [[Channath Vale]] in the [[Shaar]]. They terrorized and preyed upon all living creatures they caught in these lands, and had been an ever-present enemy of the gnomes who lived in the Nath and Rathgaunt Hills for decades up to the early 1370s DR.

However, the exact location of their base, whether a warren hideout or a temple to the Crawler Below, remained unknown, though many courageous gnome adventurers had searched for it to end the Blood Screamers' marauding. In fact, they lived in tunnels dug by [[giant ant]]s beneath the barrens in the western end, east of [[Lapalgard]].
