        "mainbody": "The '''Black Wolf''' tribe was a clan of [[hobgoblin]]s active in the southern reaches of the [[Giantspire Mountains]] and in the [[Dunwood]].",
        "Relationships": "The clan maintained a close alliance with the [[worg]]s of the Dunwood.",
        "History": "In the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the Black Wolf clan was one of the only tribes which could successfully resist the expansionism of the [[Razor Heart]] tribe throughout the Giantspires. This was largely thanks to their ability to fall back to the Dunwood and their worg allies within, as well as to the fact that their chieftan possessed a ''[[Crown of Whispers]]'', one of a pair of [[magic item]]s which imbued the wearer with great charisma. The other ''Crown'' lay in the hands of the Razor Heart queen, [[Maaqua]].",
        "Members": "The chieftan of the Black Wolf clan was [[Aruugan]] in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. While it was a clan of hobgoblins, they like many of the mightier [[goblinoid]] tribes of the Giantspires counted [[ogre]]s and [[giant]]s among their ranks."
