The Drinn were a tribe of kobolds in northwest Faer√ªn in the 14 century DR.
The tribe was led by a kobold named Olgloth Ryndrinn.
The Drinn often slew any miners they encountered in their mountains. They also sometimes conducted attacks on Citadel Adbar.
The Drinn made their home somewhere in the Ice Mountains north of Ascore.
There were around 3,700 kobolds within this tribe.
