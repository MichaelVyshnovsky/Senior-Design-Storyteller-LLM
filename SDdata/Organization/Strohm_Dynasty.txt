The Strohm Dynasty was the first dynasty of Tethyr after the fall of the Shoon Imperium and the longest reigning of all dynasties of that kingdom.
The dynasty was founded in 450 DR by King Strohm I, a Suldusk elf with human blood tracing directly back to Darrom Ithal, the founder of Tethyr. was the son of King Silvyr Ithal.
Strohm left Calimshan to its own people but set up his kingdom from the city of Zazesspur. The records of the five puppet dynasties that had ruled during the Shoon Imperium were destroyed at the beginning of the Strohm Dynasty.
Strohm Is wife was the daughter of King Priam Tornamn, which linked the Strohm dynasty to both the Ithal and Tornamn dynasties. His grandson took the name of Strohm II and was the second ruler of the family. Strohm II expanded the territory of Tethyr by defeating the nation of Tathtar in 731 DR, lands that would later become the kingdom of Erlkazar.
Strohm III, Strohm IV, and Strohm V followed in succession, each having more human blood than the previous king. but following the death of the second Mallorhen ruler, Tethyr would be ruled by four of Strohm Vs female descendants, collectively called the Queens Dynasty.
The rulers of the Strohm dynasty were the last kings trusted by the elves of the Forest of Tethir.
