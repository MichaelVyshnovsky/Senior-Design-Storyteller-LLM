The Glarondan cell was a cell of the Cult of the Dragon based in the village of Glarondar in Aglarond in the late 14 century DR.
Operating in secret and led by the necromancer Winn Kardzen, the Cult members of this cell revered the fang dragon Nartheling, who made his lair on Umbergoth Peak. Winn and his cultists periodically made expeditions up Umbergoth Peak to deliver information on affairs in the village and on local caravans and patrols Nartheling could attack and take treasure from, while persuading him to accept transformation into a dracolich.
Kardzen was also laying plans for a joint attack on the Glarondar fortress. To this end, he was raising undead from the Umber Marshes to fake an attack from Thay to draw away patrols from the Watchwall, thus allowing Nartheling to tear apart Glarondar untroubled by its defenders.
The much sought-after Grail of Shargrailar.
In the early 1370s DR, Winn was on the verge of sealing the deal with Nartheling and sought a phylactery worthy of the dragons essence, finding the Grail of Shargrailar, formed from a horn of the fallen red dragon Shargrailar, the first and most powerful dracolich. After his agents obtained the Grail and shipped it to Velprintalar, circa 1372 DR, Winn hired the merchant Tulin Farweather to transport it to his village, so as not to attract unwanted attention. However, it was lost en route. Kardzen and the Cult would try to search for and recover the lost horn, but the Grails fate is unknown.
