        "mainbody": "House Veruna is a very large trading company based in Mulmaster, with several enterprising bases in Moonsea cities.\nIn the mid 1470s DR, House Veruna commissioned a compound in the frontier town of Hulburg, with large help from Sergen Hulmaster. When Sergen made a bid for power in the 1479 DR and tried to have his family killed, he used several House Veruna mercenaries to keep them contained within Griffonwatch Keep, where Sergens minions were doing their dirty work. After the Hulmasters escaped, Sergen fled Hulburg and House Veruna was banned from the town."
