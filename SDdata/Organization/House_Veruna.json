        "History": "In the mid 1470s [[Dalereckoning|DR]], House Veruna commissioned a compound in the frontier town of [[Hulburg]], with large help from [[Sergen Hulmaster]]. When Sergen made a bid for power in the [[1479 DR]] and tried to have his family killed, he used several House Veruna mercenaries to keep them contained within [[Griffonwatch Keep]], where Sergen's minions were doing their dirty work. After the [[Hulmaster]]s escaped, Sergen fled Hulburg and House Veruna was banned from the town."
