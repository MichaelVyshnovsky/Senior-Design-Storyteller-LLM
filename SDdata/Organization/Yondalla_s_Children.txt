Yondallas Children was the collective name for the halfling pantheon, which was led by the greater deity Yondalla, known as the Protector and Provider, the Nurturing Matriarch, and the Blessed One. 
According to the Great Wheel cosmology model, Yondallas Children resided in Venya, the third layer of the Seven Heavens, which they named the Green Fields. When the World Tree cosmology model became popular, Green Fields became its own plane connected to the World Tree. Green Fields survived the Spellplague to float in the Astral Sea as described by the World Axis cosmology model.
The members of the pantheon were
* Yondalla, a greater goddess and the leader of the halfling pantheon. She was additionally a nature goddess.
*Dallah Thaun, an intermediate goddess of secrets, theft, and trickery.  She is the secret shadow of Yondalla and embodies the darker side of the goddess protective nature. 
* Sheela Peryroyl, an intermediate goddess of agriculture, love, and weather. She temporarily took up leadership of the pantheon between the Spellplague and the Second Sundering.
* Urogalan, demigod of the earth, death, and the halfling dead.
* Arvoreen, god of defense, guardians, and vigilance he was often regarded by others as a war god.
* Brandobaris, god of thievery, stealth, and curiosity.
* Cyrrollalee, goddess of friendship, trust, hospitality, and home.
In addition, the traditionally human goddess of luck Tymora has slowly been accepted among the ranks of the Pantheon.
