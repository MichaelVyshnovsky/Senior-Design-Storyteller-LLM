'''Yondalla's Children''' was the collective name for the [[halfling]] pantheon, which was led by the [[greater deity]] Yondalla, known as the Protector and Provider, the Nurturing Matriarch, and the Blessed One. 

==Base of Operations==

According to the [[Great Wheel cosmology]] model, Yondalla's Children resided in [[Seven Heavens#Venya|Venya]], the third layer of the [[Seven Heavens]], which they named the Green Fields. When the [[World Tree cosmology]] model became popular, [[Green Fields]] became its own plane connected to the [[World Tree]]. Green Fields survived the [[Spellplague]] to float in the [[Astral Sea]] as described by the [[World Axis cosmology]] model.

==Members==
The members of the pantheon were:
* [[Yondalla]], a greater goddess and the leader of the halfling pantheon. She was additionally a nature goddess.
*[[Dallah Thaun]], an intermediate goddess of secrets, theft, and trickery.  She is the secret shadow of Yondalla and embodies the darker side of the goddess' protective nature. 
* [[Sheela Peryroyl]], an intermediate goddess of agriculture, love, and weather. She temporarily took up leadership of the pantheon between the [[Spellplague]] and the [[Second Sundering]].
* [[Urogalan]], demigod of the earth, death, and the halfling dead.
* [[Arvoreen]], god of defense, guardians, and vigilance; he was often regarded by others as a war god.
* [[Brandobaris]], god of thievery, stealth, and curiosity.
* [[Cyrrollalee]], goddess of friendship, trust, hospitality, and home.

In addition, the traditionally [[human]] goddess of luck [[Tymora]] has slowly been accepted among the ranks of the Pantheon.<ref>
