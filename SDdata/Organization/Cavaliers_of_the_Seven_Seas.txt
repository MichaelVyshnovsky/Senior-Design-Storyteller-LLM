The '''Cavaliers of the Seven Seas''' were a order of [[crusader]]s who worshiped [[Istishia]], the Water Lord.

==Organization==
All members of the Cavaliers of the Seven Seas belonged to races that were natural water-breathers. They guarded sites beneath the waves that were sacred to Istishia, escorted emissaries of the clergy, and harassed worshipers of [[Kossuth]] whenever they could.
