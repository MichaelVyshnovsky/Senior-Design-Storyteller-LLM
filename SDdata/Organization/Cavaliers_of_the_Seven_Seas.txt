The Cavaliers of the Seven Seas were a order of crusaders who worshiped Istishia, the Water Lord.
All members of the Cavaliers of the Seven Seas belonged to races that were natural water-breathers. They guarded sites beneath the waves that were sacred to Istishia, escorted emissaries of the clergy, and harassed worshipers of Kossuth whenever they could.
