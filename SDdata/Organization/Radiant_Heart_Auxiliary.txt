The '''Radiant Heart Auxiliary''' was the junior wing of the [[Order of the Radiant Heart]], comprised of knights who were not yet old enough or highly regarded enough to gain membership to the senior branch of the Order. Most of the Paladins of the Radiant Heart Auxiliary pledged themselves to goodly deities; followers of [[Torm]] and [[Helm]] were particularly common among their ranks.

{{Quote|''"A loyal heart and a faithful spirit."''|Motto of the ''Radiant Heart Auxiliary''}}

==Joining the Auxiliary==
In order for a prospective paladin to join the Radiant Heart Auxiliary, they were first be sponsored by an active member of the senior branch of the Order, ''The Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart''. Two of the Council of three Prelates had to approve the membership and assented for the initiate to be accepted into the fraternity.

==Organization==
Each chapter of the Order of the Radiant Heart had it's own auxiliary, consisting of no more than 40 members. They were usually based in large towns or cities. A ''Chairman'', elected from the ranks, conducted the Auxiliary's meetings; however, the Chairman was not considered a high officer, merely an elected representative.

Each member of the Radiant Heart Auxiliary served for a typical term of five years. After this time, they could either voluntarily retire from the Order or renew their membership for another five years. In order to retain their position as a member, a paladin must have had the unanimous vote of all current Auxiliary members and approval of two Prelates.

===Notable Members===
*[[Anomen Delryn]], a warrior priest of Helm and member of the ''Radiant Heart Auxiliary''
*[[Ajantis Ilvastarr]], a squire who was sent by the Order to investigate the [[Iron crisis]] that was plaguing the [[Sword Coast]] in [[1368 DR]]
