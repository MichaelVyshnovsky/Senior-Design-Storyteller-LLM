House Yauntyrr was a noble house of Eryndlyn until its destruction circa 1362 DR.
Circa 1362 DR, House Yauntyrr was attacked and defeated. Many members of the house were killed others were taken in by Ched Nasads houses (such as Danifae Yauntyrr, who became a battle captive to Halisstra Melarn) and yet other survivors fled into the Underdark.
