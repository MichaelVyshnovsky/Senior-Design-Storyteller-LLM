'''House Yauntyrr''' was a noble house of [[Eryndlyn]] until its destruction circa [[1362 DR]].

==History==
Circa [[1362 DR]], House Yauntyrr was attacked and defeated. Many members of the house were killed; others were taken in by [[Ched Nasad]]'s houses (such as [[Danifae Yauntyrr]], who became a battle captive to [[Halisstra Melarn]]) and yet other survivors fled into the [[Underdark]].

==Notable members==
* '''[[Danifae Yauntyrr]]''', [[Chosen of Lolth]].
* '''[[Zinnirit Yauntyrr]]''', last house wizard.
