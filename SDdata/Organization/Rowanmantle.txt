'''Rowanmantle''' was a small noble house of [[Cormyr]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail|?}}

==History==
The family was originally from the [[Tilverton]] area but moved its base to Suzail at some point.

==Relations==
The family strongly supported the [[Obarskyr]]s and advised the crown during the rule of the [[Steel Regent]].

The house's strong [[Dalelands]] connections helped to forge an alliance between Cormyr, the Dalelands and [[Cormanthor]]. This alliance forced [[Sembia]] to agree to peace terms.
