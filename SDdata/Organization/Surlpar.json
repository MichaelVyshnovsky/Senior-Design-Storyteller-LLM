        "mainbody": "he Surlpar family was one of the twenty families that made up the hereditary council of lords (known as the Onsruur) in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nThe Surlpars did not have any striking distinguishing features, but their hair was always blond, platinum blond, or white. Their wealth allowed them to pursue pleasure and self-gratification, but they bickered among themselves, forming cliques within the family. Because they were not unified in vision and ambition, their reputation was severely tarnished, and by 1372 DR they were a dim reflection of their former glory in the Onsruur, hated by many.\nThe Surlpars had significant property holdings and rented most of them out. In addition to being landlords, they were also in the moneylending business, taking advantage of those with a need for capital or to cover a shortfall.\nThe rumors about breeding monsters in the basement of their mansion were true. They used them as guardians of treasure, sport hunting, and sold them to interested parties.\n* Ensril Surlpar Owner of Surlpars Stews, a rat-infested blurdren (food counter)."
