        "mainbody": "The '''Surlpar''' family was one of the twenty families that made up the hereditary council of lords (known as the [[Onsruur]]) in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|88}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 66: Khôltar, Part 17, More on the Onsruur}}",
        "Organization": "The Surlpars did not have any striking distinguishing features, but their hair was always blond, platinum blond, or white. Their wealth allowed them to pursue pleasure and self-gratification, but they bickered among themselves, forming cliques within the family. Because they were not unified in vision and ambition, their reputation was severely tarnished, and by 1372 DR they were a dim reflection of their former glory in the Onsruur, hated by many.",
        "Activities": "The Surlpars had significant property holdings and rented most of them out. In addition to being landlords, they were also in the moneylending business, taking advantage of those with a need for capital or to cover a shortfall.\n\nThe rumors about breeding monsters in the basement of their mansion were true. They used them as guardians of treasure, sport hunting, and sold them to interested parties.",
