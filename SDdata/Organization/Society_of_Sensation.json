        "mainbody": "The '''Society of Sensation''', also known as the '''Sensates''', was one of the fifteen factions of [[Sigil]]. They believed the only validation of existence was that which could be experienced by the senses. To attain a form of collective enlightenment, they sought to experience as much of the [[multiverse]] in this manner as they could.\n\n{{Quote|The multiverse beckons with too many fingersâ€”a bittersweet agony. No mortal being can ever truly know a fraction of its immeasurable treasures. But we in the Society of Sensations have sworn our lives to the attempt.|Anonymous.}}",
        "Organization": "The Society of Sensations was led by [[Factol]] [[Erin Montgomery]],",
        "Activities": "{{Quote|Look for us as we walk the planes. You'll see the truth in our words as we take the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures of absolutely...everything.|Vamniss Softhearted.}}\n\nSensates used extraordinary [[magic]]al devices to record all the sensations they experienced during their travels and maintained that collected information at their central base of operations in Sigil.\n\nThey learned how to finely hone their senses and could develop [[infravision]] outwards to a range of {{SI|60|ft}}.",
        "Beliefs": "{{Quote|Touch it. Smell it. Taste it. See it. Hit it.|Factol [[Erin Montgomery]].}}\n\nSensates believed that only when a being has experienced every possible perception and experience could they become aware of the \"universal Truth\". All of these sensations were meant to be enjoyed and fully explored, rather than encountered in passing for the sole purpose of recording.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Sensates' primary [[plane of existence]] was the plane of [[Arborea]].\n\nThe Society of Sensation maintained their headquarters within the [[Civic Festhall]] in Sigil.",
        "Possessions": "Some of the most loyal and experienced Sensates were gifted ''[[Sensate amulet|magical amulets]]'' that granted them protective boons as they traveled across the various planes of existence.",
        "Relationships": "[[File:Sensate.png|thumb|right|300px|A member of the Society of Sensations.]]\nThe Society of Sensation remained philosophically aligned with the [[Sign of One]] and the two organizations often collaborated with one another. The Sensates remained neutral but polite towards the [[Fraternity of Order]] and the [[Free League]], but were diametrically opposed to the beliefs of the [[Doomguard]].\n\nThe [[Dustmen]] and often times the [[Mercykillers]] considered the Sensates among their enemies.",
        "Members": "Any and all individuals were accepted into the Society of Sensation, regardless of race, occupation, gender, or [[alignment|moral and ethical alignment]]. As such it enjoyed a high membership rate. To join, an individual had to log at least five experiences within the Civic Festhall on Sigil.\n\n[[Githyanki]] typically avoided joining the ranks of the Sensates."
