Clan Ibeig was one of the dragonborn clans of the nation of Tymanther.
Clan Ibeig was a minor clan founded in 1476 DR. At the time, it had only two members, a couple of newlywed dragonborn who had retired from the Lance Defenders to live in the outskirts of Ruinspoke. They formed their clan in the hopes that their descendants would transform it into a true, prosperous farming clan.
The couple lived in a small, highly defensible farmstead that looked more like a military barracks than a farm, and they made a living selling eggs, fruits, and vegetables, and their popular peach jam to the merchants of Ruinspoke.
They were allies of Clan Jalt. In fact, members of that clan encouraged the young couple to found their own clan.
In 1479 DR, the couple helped a band of adventurers to deal with kobold problems in the vicinity.
In 1480 DR, the couple also helped adventurers to deal with Queen Sisays kobold army.
