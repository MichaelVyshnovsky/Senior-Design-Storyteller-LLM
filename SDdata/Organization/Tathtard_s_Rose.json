        "mainbody": "Tathtards Rose was a syndicate of ruthless merchants that aimed to make its members very wealthy, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nThis cabal was led by Neviol Tathtard, a furniture maker from Silverymoon. The dozen or so members were spread around Luruar in the major trading towns.\nUnder Tathtards leadership, the Rose kept a low profile, skirted the edges of the law, and maintained secrecy. They operated under the principle that all members would see steady, moderate, long-term profits such that no member would be tempted to betray the others for a large, short-term score. They shared privileged information, engaged in price fixing, instigated shortages of goods in key markets, and sent business opportunities to each other.\nTrusted personal servants were used as spies and operatives all around Luruar, and one of their regular posts was the Missing Minotaur tavern in western Everlund. Any talk of trade being bandied about the Minotaur was sure to reach the ears of Tathtards Rose agents.\nAt some point in the history of the Rose, one member and his entire family, including servants, died suddenly by poisoning. All coins, gems, and trade bars belonging to the merchant disappeared before the massacre was discovered. None of the other members knew who was responsible, except of course, Neviol Tathtard, who ordered his trusted agents to do the dastardly deed, eliminating a rival."
