        "mainbody": "'''Tathtard's Rose''' was a syndicate of ruthless merchants that aimed to make its members very wealthy, ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].",
        "Organization": "This cabal was led by [[Neviol Tathtard]], a furniture maker from [[Silverymoon]]. The dozen or so members were spread around [[Luruar]] in the major trading towns.",
        "Tactics": "Under Tathtard's leadership, the Rose kept a low profile, skirted the edges of the law, and maintained secrecy. They operated under the principle that all members would see steady, moderate, long-term profits such that no member would be tempted to betray the others for a large, short-term score. They shared privileged information, engaged in price fixing, instigated shortages of goods in key markets, and sent business opportunities to each other.\n\nTrusted personal servants were used as spies and operatives all around Luruar, and one of their regular posts was the [[Missing Minotaur]] tavern in western [[Everlund]]. Any talk of trade being bandied about the Minotaur was sure to reach the ears of Tathtard's Rose agents.",
        "History": "At some point in the history of the Rose, one member and his entire family, including servants, died suddenly by poisoning. All coins, [[gem]]s, and [[trade bar]]s belonging to the merchant disappeared before the massacre was discovered. None of the other members knew who was responsible, except of course, Neviol Tathtard, who ordered his trusted agents to do the dastardly deed, eliminating a rival."
