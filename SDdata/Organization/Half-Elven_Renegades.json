        "mainbody": "The '''Half-Elven Renegades''' was a name given to a group of [[half-elf]] bandits who raided along the [[Delimbiyr]] from within the [[High Forest]] in [[northwest Faerûn]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Members": "Debased descendants of the fallen elven realm of [[Eaerlann]] (following its collapse in [[882 DR]]<ref>), the majority were [[half-elves]] of mostly [[moon elf]] extraction, with a significant minority of [[half-drow]], and [[human]]s with a significant amount of elven ancestry. They were the products of unions of Eaerlanni [[elves]], [[drow]], and humans in generations past. Estimates of their number ranged from several dozen to around a hundred.",
        "Organization": "They were led by \"Princess\" [[Tianna Skyflower]], the most notorious of the Half-Elven Renegades.\n\nTianna's lieutenants were known as \"Barons\", such as Baron [[Rudain]].",
        "Activities": "The Renegades acted as brigands and raiders, harassing and robbing traders and travelers through the [[Delimbiyr Vale]] along the forest's southern fringe. They normally prowled from north of Shining Falls to west of [[Secomber]], but occasionally went as far west as [[Daggerford]] and the [[High Moor]].\n\nTheir main source of income was ransom demands on those they kidnapped. They kept their demands low and didn't harm their captives so as to make it more likely the ransom would be paid, but if no one paid up, they sold the captives to the [[Zhentarim]] as slaves.\n\nSince the freeing of the [[fey'ri]], the Renegades found very well-paying work kidnapping [[sun elf|gold elves]] for them so that the fey'ri could breed the captives with [[demon]]s to create more of their kind. If Tianna were to find out what the elves were being used for, she would have immediately stopped the trade, so the fey'ri disguised themselves as members of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] and paid for the elves with Earlanni artifacts.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Half-Elven Renegades continued to occupy the old lands of Eaerlann in the High Forest. For their bases, they always chose Earlanni ruins and other sites, owing to their belief or image they were the rightful successors to the kingdom.\n\nTianna originally made her base and home in the [[Dire Wood]], but later relocated to the edge of the forest, near [[Shining Falls]].",
        "History": "The Half-Elven Renegades were an active threat under Princess Tianna Skyflower by [[1358 DR]].\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], she had shifted her base from the Dire Wood to the forest's edge near Shining Falls, her purpose unknown.",
        "Known Members": "* Princess [[Tianna Skyflower]], leader of the Renegades\n* Baron [[Rudain]], in charge of the Renegade base at the [[Cavern of Blooming Stone]]."
