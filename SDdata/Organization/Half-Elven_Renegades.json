        "mainbody": "The Half-Elven Renegades was a name given to a group of half-elf bandits who raided along the Delimbiyr from within the High Forest in northwest Faer√ªn in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nDebased descendants of the fallen elven realm of Eaerlann (following its collapse in 882 DR), the majority were half-elves of mostly moon elf extraction, with a significant minority of half-drow, and humans with a significant amount of elven ancestry. They were the products of unions of Eaerlanni elves, drow, and humans in generations past. Estimates of their number ranged from several dozen to around a hundred.\nThey were led by \"Princess\" Tianna Skyflower, the most notorious of the Half-Elven Renegades.\nTiannas lieutenants were known as \"Barons\", such as Baron Rudain.\nThe Renegades acted as brigands and raiders, harassing and robbing traders and travelers through the Delimbiyr Vale along the forests southern fringe. They normally prowled from north of Shining Falls to west of Secomber, but occasionally went as far west as Daggerford and the High Moor.\nTheir main source of income was ransom demands on those they kidnapped. They kept their demands low and didnt harm their captives so as to make it more likely the ransom would be paid, but if no one paid up, they sold the captives to the Zhentarim as slaves.\nSince the freeing of the feyri, the Renegades found very well-paying work kidnapping gold elves for them so that the feyri could breed the captives with demons to create more of their kind. If Tianna were to find out what the elves were being used for, she would have immediately stopped the trade, so the feyri disguised themselves as members of the Arcane Brotherhood and paid for the elves with Earlanni artifacts.\nThe Half-Elven Renegades continued to occupy the old lands of Eaerlann in the High Forest. For their bases, they always chose Earlanni ruins and other sites, owing to their belief or image they were the rightful successors to the kingdom.\nTianna originally made her base and home in the Dire Wood, but later relocated to the edge of the forest, near Shining Falls.\nThe Half-Elven Renegades were an active threat under Princess Tianna Skyflower by 1358 DR.\nBy 1370 DR, she had shifted her base from the Dire Wood to the forests edge near Shining Falls, her purpose unknown.\n* Princess Tianna Skyflower, leader of the Renegades\n* Baron Rudain, in charge of the Renegade base at the Cavern of Blooming Stone."
