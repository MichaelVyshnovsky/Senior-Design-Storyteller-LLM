The Tylmarandes were a family of half-elves from Neverwinter.
The Tylmarandes were mostly a family of adventurers. Their most infamous member was Aribeth de Tylmarande, who stained the familys reputation in 1372 DR when she betrayed Neverwinter during the war against Luskan that followed the Wailing Death.
During the Ruining of 1451 DR, the Tylmarandes were one of the few families that refused to abandon the city in the aftermath of its destruction.
