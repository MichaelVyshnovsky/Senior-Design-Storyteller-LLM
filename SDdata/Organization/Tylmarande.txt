The '''Tylmarandes''' were a family of [[half-elves]] from [[Neverwinter]].

==Background==
The Tylmarandes were mostly a family of [[adventurer]]s. Their most infamous member was [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]], who stained the family's reputation in [[1372 DR]] when she betrayed Neverwinter during the war against [[Luskan]] that followed the [[Wailing Death]].

During the [[Ruining]] of [[1451 DR]], the Tylmarandes were one of the few families that refused to abandon the city in the aftermath of its destruction.

==Notable Members==
* [[Aribeth de Tylmarande]]
* [[Seldra Tylmarande]]
