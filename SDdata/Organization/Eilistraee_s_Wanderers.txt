'''Eilistraee's Wanderers''' were a group of [[drow]] that worked to aid the rebuilding of [[Myth Drannor]] in [[1374 DR]]. They were closely aligned with the [[Elves of Cormanthor]] led by [[Tannivh Dahast]], which had similar goals.{{DDO-MoMDtime}}

|Don't you see? If Eilistraee's Wanderers find the key to controlling this [[Mythal]] and then turn that key over to the Cormanthor Elvesâ€”well, something that important will prove who we are beyond any doubt.<br/>Then the Elves will have to accept us, have to accept that we are [[Corellon]]'s children. Just as they are!|[[Chessae Baenrahel]]}}

==History==
The group was formed when [[Kelgoth Darksong]] found an ancient chronicle describing the raising of the city's ''[[mythal]]'' in [[261 DR]], and realized that it also described the key to the ''mythal''. With this knowledge, the damaged ''mythal'' could be repaired and controlled, and provide a powerful first step in the recovery of the city. Kelgoth assembled his friends and allies and set off to Myth Drannor, joining the Cormanthor Elves at their [[Myth Drannor outskirts camp|camp]] in the outskirts of the ruins. Unfortunately, the Elves were already hard-pressed by the many threats in the area and were not able or willing to strike into the city to pursue what seemed like rumors. Unwilling to wait, Kelgoth, [[Zeliira]], and [[Uhlsdrin Nirveth|Uhlsdrin]] set off on their own missions, but were each overcome or blocked by the threats lurking within the city.

==Members==
The Wanderers were made up of various drow who agreed with Kelgoth's plan, including some from as far away as [[Imberlur]]. Their members included:
* [[Kelgoth Darksong]], their leader.
* [[Irrwyss Fret'tar]]
* [[Izzinid Claddafin]]
* [[Greyarra Auvryath]]
* [[Uhlsdrin Nirveth]] 
* [[Durfryn Alearn]]
* [[Chessae Baenrahel]]
* [[Zeliira]]
