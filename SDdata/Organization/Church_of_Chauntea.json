        "mainbody": "The Church of Chauntea was the primary religious organization of the followers of the deity Chauntea, the Great Mother. It was present almost everywhere in Faer√ªn, due to its prevalence in agrarian life.\nFaithfuls believed that Chauntea was as old as the world itself. They saw her as one that gave life to natural creatures and plants, and that gifted humanoid races with the secrets of agriculture.\nLand owners and farmers hit with unproductive harvests visited her clerics for divine suggestions. If at any time plague or drought struck the crops, farmers looked to the goddess, since they hoped she would save the harvest due to her love of nature.\nIt was believed that money donated to a temple of the church would return to the giver tenfold.\nPractitioners of the Chauntean faith cared about the fertility of the earth, the growing and reaping of plants, and the eternal cycle of life. They often shared food with strangers and people in need, freely sharing the bounty of the land.\nConsidering destruction and leveling without rebuilding as a disgrace, the faithful avoided using fire and planted a seed of a small plant at least once per tenday. They made to always till their wastes back into agricultural soil, in order to support new life.\nMembers of the clergy were quiet and patient, emulating the qualities they saw in their goddess. They were known for their wisdom, and for their willingness to help with agricultural work, taking a hands-on approach especially when farmers were ill of injured. This caused them to receive great respect and admiration from their peers.\nWhile the faith revolved around a doctrine made of values and taboos, there were as many interpretations as there were practitioners. Knowing that their goddess was everywhere and could see everything, the majority of Nurturers led a good and honest life. A few however saw nothing wrong with lying or stealing in order to acquire good land&mdashthey reasoned that treasures dont feed anyone or keep them warm, and that lying was merely countering human foolishness with more of the same.\nPriests of the faith had a mission to learn as much as possible about plants,including topics such as horticulture, plant types and diseases, and general folk knowledge regarding flora. Some Nurturers would also study monsters, while others would focus on details of the natural order of things such as erosion, water currents or wind patterns.\nMembers of the clergy shared their knowledge with clergymen and laypeople alike. They encouraged civilized folks to enrich the land using methods such as replanting, composting, and irrigation. In addition to planting, priests instructed their flock on the identification of plants, and of disease impacting the flora and fauna.\nDue to the clergys teachings, most common folks felt a closeness to \"natural cycles\"&mdashthanks to this, there were no religious nor social stigma regarding womens monthly bleeding.\nOn their travels members of the church planted trees, removed weeds hampering crops, prepared the land to receive crops, and used spells to drive away predators. They burned diseased plants as well as the corpse of plague-ridden animals in order to prevent contamination, and were always watching such blazes extremely carefully.\nChauntean agriculture included practices such as diverting waterways and draining wetlands to help plant more harvestable crops.\nIn some places such as Felshroun, members of the clergy would accompany patrols in order to defend the inhabitants against trouble.\nThe faithful of Chauntea were encouraged to donate any extra seed their plants yielded to temples, so the seeds could be redistributed to those in need.\nIt was usual for orphans to be raised by priests and laypeople in their temples. The clergy of Chauntea was often tasked with such charges, as it was seen as a \"neutral\" faith by other clergies and could use the extra pair of hands to help with labor-intensive agricultural activities.\nthumb|right|200px|A priestess of Chauntea and a priest of Silvanus.\nPeople of all races joined the church, and a vast majority of them were females.\nDue to their affinity with the Earth domain, Earth genasi were common amongst the clergy.

Hierarchy was based on wisdom and length of service, favoring the individuals with a higher understanding of nature and its cycles.\n Titles \n Close One &bull Watchful Brother / Sister of the Earth &bull Trueseed &bull Harvestmaster / Harvestmistress &bull High Harvestmaster / High Harvestmistress &bull Onum \nIn addition, rural clerics referred to themselves as \"Pastorals\", whereas some older sects focused on the wilderness called themselves the \"True Shapers\".\nThe clergy of Chauntea was known to have no affiliated military of knightly orders.\n* The Sisters of the House an all-female order of priestesses who tended to the Harvest House in Amn.\n* The Bountiful Lady of the Vast Circle a small druidic circle active near Ravens Bluff and Dragon Falls.\nAs much as possible, members of the church strived to pray on freshly tilled ground, in a farmland, or in a garden.
