'''Cyric's Legion''' was an army amassed by [[Szass Tam]], the [[Zulkir]] of [[Necromancy]] in [[Thay]], in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. It was named for the [[god]] [[Cyric]]. 

==History==
The Legion was the successor to Tam's [[undead]] [[Myrkul's Legion]], which suffered a major defeat in an attempted invasion of [[Rashemen]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}. Following the [[Time of Troubles]], Cyric's Legion was made into Tam's largest military force, and he continued to swell its ranks with undead in preparation for civil conflict with his Thayan rivals.

==Members==
