'''House Naerhand''' was a merchant house operating from the [[Sword Coast]] to the western [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] as of [[1479 DR]].  Although the clan was fabulously wealthy, they avoided joining the ranks of nobles, preferring to work behind the scenes.  The family dominated the harness making trade and controlled key rest stops and watering holes along trade routes.  The family owned hundreds of properties in [[Suzail]], [[Athkatla]], [[Saerloon]] and [[Waterdeep]] and placed spies within many noble families in Waterdeep and [[Cormyr]].  The Naerhand's were known for avenging any wrongs done to the family although they often used indirect means to achieve vengeance.[[Ed Greenwood]].

==Leadership==
The clan was always led by a matriarch.  As of 1479 DR, [[Janszeene Naerhand]] was the acting matriarch although her mother, Velarra still took an active hand in management of the family's business.[[Ed Greenwood]].
