        "mainbody": "House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul\nThe Lions Dynasty was one of the ruling dynasties of Tethyr. It was largely to blame for the political instability and chaos leading up to the Tethyrian Interregnum period.\nThe symbol and name of the dynasty derive from a tale told in which Prince Nearel used a magic horn to summon a pack of sea cats, or \"sea lions\", to defend against a band of assassins that where pursuing him.\nThe dynasty was established in 959 DR by Mhoaran the Tusk-Bearded, when he took the throne from King Teremir I of the Bormul Dynasty by force.\nMhoaran was succeeded by his seventeenth son Nearel, and afterwards by Kortal, Haedrak I, Coram I, and Coram II.\nThe line of rule was briefly interrupted in 1070 DR, when Teremir II of the Bormul Dynasty slew Coram II in a duel and briefly reestablished the Bormuls on the throne. When Alemander I killed Teremir II the next year, power returned to the Lions Dynasty.\nIn 1145 DR, Coram III, Alemanders great-grandson, officially changed the familys name from \"House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul\" to simply \"House Tethyr\".\nAlemander II and Coram IV followed in line. Then, Kymer, an illegitimate half-elf son of Alemander II, usurped the throne, killing Coram and his family. One of Coram IVs sons, however, escaped death. The \"Corsair Prince\", Haedrak II, spent five years building an army and finally retook the throne from his uncle in 1227 DR, killing him in a duel.\nDuring the year 1274 DR, in an event known as the Kinslayings, seven royal princesses of House Tethyr were assassinated in Waterdeep. Upon hearing the news, King Haedrak died, leaving his third son Errilam I Alemander III, Errilams nephew, became the next king, since Errilam had no surviving heirs.\nIn 1288 DR, the daughter of Errilams surviving sister was also assassinated in Waterdeep. The so-called \"Waterdeep Curse\" continued as the next king, Jaszur, who was Haedrak IIs grand-nephew, was slaughtered on a return trip to Tethyr from Waterdeep after having eased the tensions between the two lands.\nOlosar, Jaszurs twin,\nAlemander IV was a harsh ruler not well-liked by his people, and he had a strained relationship with his first son Alemander V. Alemander V joined with some of the lesser nobles of Tethyr and plotted a coup to gain power from his father. The plan did not go as planned, as the royal palace, Castle Tethyr, was burned to the ground, killing not only the king but also the queen, Alemander V, and their whole family. This event triggered the Ten Black Days of Eleint and ended the dynasty in 1347 DR."
