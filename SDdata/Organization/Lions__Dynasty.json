        "mainbody": "The '''Lions' Dynasty''' was one of the ruling dynasties of [[Tethyr]]. It was largely to blame for the political instability and chaos leading up to the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]] period.",
        "Dynastic Seal": "The symbol and name of the dynasty derive from a tale told in which Prince [[Nearel]] used a magic horn to summon a pack of [[sea cat]]s, or \"sea lions\", to defend against a band of assassins that where pursuing him.",
        "History": "The dynasty was established in [[959 DR]] by [[Mhoaran]] the Tusk-Bearded, when he took the throne from King [[Teremir I]] of the [[Bormul Dynasty]] by force.\n\nMhoaran was succeeded by his seventeenth son Nearel, and afterwards by [[Kortal]], [[Haedrak I]], [[Coram I]], and [[Coram II]].\n\nThe line of rule was briefly interrupted in [[1070 DR]], when [[Teremir Bormul II|Teremir II]] of the Bormul Dynasty slew Coram II in a duel and briefly reestablished the Bormul's on the throne. When [[Alemander I]] killed Teremir II the next year, power returned to the Lions' Dynasty.\n\nIn [[1145 DR]], [[Coram III]], Alemander's great-grandson, officially changed the family's name from \"House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul\" to simply \"House Tethyr\".\n\n[[Alemander II]] and [[Coram IV]] followed in line. Then, [[Kymer]], an illegitimate [[half-elf]] son of Alemander II, usurped the throne, killing Coram and his family. One of Coram IV's sons, however, escaped death. The \"Corsair Prince\", [[Haedrak II]], spent five years building an army and finally retook the throne from his uncle in [[1227 DR]], killing him in a duel.\n\nDuring the year [[1274 DR]], in an event known as the [[Kinslayings]], seven royal princesses of House Tethyr were assassinated in [[Waterdeep]]. Upon hearing the news, King Haedrak died, leaving his third son [[Errilam I]] [[Alemander III]], Errilam's nephew, became the next king, since Errilam had no surviving heirs.\n\nIn [[1288 DR]], the [[Shaerglynda|daughter]] of Errilam's surviving [[Vajra (princess)|sister]] was also assassinated in Waterdeep. The so-called \"[[Waterdeep Curse]]\" continued as the next king, [[Jaszur]], who was Haedrak II's grand-nephew, was slaughtered on a return trip to Tethyr from Waterdeep after having eased the tensions between the two lands.\n\n[[Olosar]], Jaszur's twin,\n\nAlemander IV was a harsh ruler not well-liked by his people, and he had a strained relationship with his first son Alemander V. Alemander V joined with some of the lesser nobles of Tethyr and plotted a coup to gain power from his father. The plan did not go as planned, as the royal palace, [[Castle Tethyr]], was burned to the ground, killing not only the king but also the queen, Alemander V, and their whole family. This event triggered the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]] and ended the dynasty in [[1347 DR]].",
