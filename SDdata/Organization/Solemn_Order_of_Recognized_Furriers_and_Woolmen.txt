The '''Solemn Order of Recognized Furriers and Woolmen''' was a [[Guilds of Waterdeep|guild]] of [[Waterdeep]] representing the city's furriers and wool workers.

==Organization==
The official livery of the Solemn Order was gray, fur-trimmed woolen [[cloak]]s in the winter, and gray, fur-fringed woolen [[skullcap (cap)|skullcaps]] in the summer.

Applying for membership required a deposit of 25 [[gp]], refunded if the application were refused. Members were also charged 2 gp in monthly dues.

The Master of the Order was elected by its members, usually for life. A Master resigning was virtually unheard of, with most holding on to their titles even as they lay bedridden or dying.

==Activities==
The Solemn Order was a storied fixture in the fur trade of Waterdeep, over which they exerted near-total control. Independent businesses were summarily outbid or outright sabotaged.

Although the guild proudly asserted none of its furriers dealt in fake, second-hand, or stolen wares (and were thus "recognized"), this was occasionally not heeded by certain members.

==Base of Operations==
The guild was based out of the [[Guildhall of the Order]] in the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]], located on [[Waterdeep Way]] between the intersections of the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]] and the [[Street of Bells]].

==Relationships==
As a highly conservative organization, the Solemn Order distrusted enterprising, young merchants as well as [[adventurer]]s. They considered these people reckless and dangerous.

The Order was closely associated with the [[Nobility of Waterdeep|noble]] [[Talmost|House Talmost]], local industry leaders in fur-trading and trapping.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1338}}, [[Thoss Balein]] was elected Master of the Order when his predecessor died. Thoss implemented a series of highly conservative policies intended to strengthen the Order, including refusing to accept new members and encouraging rich members to buy less wealthy merchants out of the guild. Over the course of Thoss Balein's tenure, guild membership shrunk by 25% while revenues rose by 40%.

In [[1479 DR]],<ref group="note">The date for all Year 1 RPGA sanctioned adventures is considered to be [[1479 DR]] for the purposes of this wiki. Guildmaster [[Kalander Hornhand]] passed away and his wife [[Daundratha Hornhand|Daundratha]] took over the role of leadership. While planning for his funeral at the guild's tomb within the [[City of the Dead]] they discovered [[undead]] within it. Daundratha quickly set about hiring a group of [[adventurer]]s to clear out the tomb for them.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Woolmen's Restless Tomb|4}}

Some time later, [[Aldemur Scrope]] took charge of the guild. He was killed under mysterious circumstances in [[1491 DR]], during the series of murders that targeted the [[Masked Lord|masked lords]], guild masters, and nobles of Waterdeep.


==Members==
The guild was generally composed of members of old Waterdhavian families.
