The Guild of Naturalists was devoted to studying and cataloging the flora and fauna near Arabel, Cormyr in 1368 DR.
The Guild of Naturalist comprised local sages and scholars. The Guildmaster in 1368 DR was an elderly man named Elmdaerle.
The Guild operated out of Arabel. Its members often helped Elmdaerle mount new specimens in his inn, the Falcons Rest.
