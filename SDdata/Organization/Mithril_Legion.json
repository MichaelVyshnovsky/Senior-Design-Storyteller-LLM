        "History": "[[Borlin]] inspired a large number of dwarven warriors to form the Mithril Legion and embark on a quest to reclaim the Mines of Tethyamar. They marched out of [[Tilverton]] in [[1364 DR|the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR]], heading north-west, and vanished, their fate unknown.\n\nSome claimed that Borlin and the Mithril Legion had successfully retaken part of the Mines, and sent a report of such to King Ghellin via [[magic]], but this was only speculation.\n\nIn fact, Borlin and the Legion made a successful assault against one of gates into Tethyamar, but ran into an [[orc]]-fashioned ''portal''. This transported them deep into the mines, far from the entrance. Steadily, they fought their way through the orcs and back to the surface, but fell one-by-one. Borlin was the last, but he died in sight of Tethyamar's doors.",
        "Leadership": "The Mithril Legion was led by Borlin, blood of Ghellin, Axe of the Iron House, of the exiled royal court of the Mines of Tethyamar.",
