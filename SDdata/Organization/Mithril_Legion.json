        "mainbody": "The Mithril Legion, or Mithral Legion, was a dwarven army that quested to recover the lost Mines of Tethyamar in the 1360s DR.\nBorlin inspired a large number of dwarven warriors to form the Mithril Legion and embark on a quest to reclaim the Mines of Tethyamar. They marched out of Tilverton in the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR, heading north-west, and vanished, their fate unknown.\nSome claimed that Borlin and the Mithril Legion had successfully retaken part of the Mines, and sent a report of such to King Ghellin via magic, but this was only speculation.\nIn fact, Borlin and the Legion made a successful assault against one of gates into Tethyamar, but ran into an orc-fashioned portal. This transported them deep into the mines, far from the entrance. Steadily, they fought their way through the orcs and back to the surface, but fell one-by-one. Borlin was the last, but he died in sight of Tethyamars doors.\nThe Mithril Legion was led by Borlin, blood of Ghellin, Axe of the Iron House, of the exiled royal court of the Mines of Tethyamar.\nCategoryMilitary organizations\nCategoryDwarven organizations\nCategoryOrganizations in Faer√ªn\nCategoryOrganizations on Toril\nCategoryOrganizations\nqndjaxdaqaqfm1pbjbih990c4jcoyjk"
