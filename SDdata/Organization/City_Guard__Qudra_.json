        "mainbody": "The City Guard of the Qudra was an impressive military organization that served as a police force within the city as well as a standing army for the \"City of Power\".\nThe composition of the city guard as of  was 25,000 mamluk infantry, 6,000 mamluk cavalry, 400 special aerial troops, and 50 naval vessels.\nIt should be noted that each and every mamluk of Qudra was a highly trained slave that was far more superior on the battlefield compared to a regular Zakharan soldier. Each and every mamluk technically belonged to the Grand Caliph in Huzuz, and were only allowed to serve other masters under the Grand Caliphs strict permission. Only half of Qudras ships were in working order as of 1367 DR thanks to a recent failed assault on the corsair city of Hawa, as well as a general state of disrepair from neglect.\nTo provide magical aid, Qudra hired arcane and divine spellcasters when needed."
