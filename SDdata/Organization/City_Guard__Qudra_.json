        "mainbody": "The '''City Guard''' of the [[Qudra]] was an impressive military organization that served as a police force within the city as well as a standing army for the \"City of Power\".",
        "Organization": "The composition of the city guard as of {{Yearlink|1367}}{{AQ-time}} was 25,000 [[mamluk]] infantry, 6,000 mamluk cavalry, 400 special aerial troops, and 50 naval vessels.",
        "Activities": "It should be noted that each and every mamluk of Qudra was a highly trained slave that was far more superior on the battlefield compared to a regular [[Zakhara]]n soldier. Each and every mamluk technically belonged to the [[Grand Caliph]] in [[Huzuz]], and were only allowed to serve other masters under the Grand Caliph's strict permission. Only half of Qudra's ships were in working order as of 1367 DR thanks to a recent failed assault on the [[Corsair (kit)|corsair]] city of [[Hawa]], as well as a general state of disrepair from neglect.\n\nTo provide magical aid, Qudra hired [[Arcane magic|arcane]] and [[Divine magic|divine]] spellcasters when needed."
