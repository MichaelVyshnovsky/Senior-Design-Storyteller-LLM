        "mainbody": "The Elk tribe was an Uthgardt barbarian tribe of the Silver Marches.\nThe Elk tribes ancestral mound was the Flint Rock,The original 1-edition sourcebook The Savage Frontier and the 2-edition The North spell it as \"Flintrock\", whereas the 3-edition Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting spells it \"Flint Rock\". Later sources use this form. though by 1357 DR theyd largely abandoned it. Without the faithful to upkeep it, it fell into a decrepit state.\nIn the mid-to-late 1300s DR, the tribe typically ranged over the Evermoors, the plains east of the River Dessarin, and along the Dessarin and the lower Surbrin valleys, as well as in the Lurkwood. In the late 1400s DR, they held roughly the same amount of territory, considering the Dessarin Valley their territory and roaming the Evermoors and the lands north of the Dessarin between Noanars Hold and Yartar, exploring the Westwood and Sumber Hills and even as far as Mithral Hall and Nesmé.\nthumb|right|250px|Holga Kilgore, an exiled warrior of the Elk tribe.\nIn the mid-to-late 1300s DR, the Elk tribe were seen as the most arrogant, ill-tempered, and self-indulgent of the Uthgardt tribes and they were regarded by most as little more than raiders and pillagers. They regularly raided caravans and villages, even those of other tribes for food, for women, and just for the fun of it. They carried away prisoners to ransom, but if the ransom wasnt enough for their liking, they kept the ransom money and sold the prisoner to slavers.\nBy the , the Elk tribe completely shunned all aspects of \"civilized\" society. They avoided towns and cities, and typically did not bother homesteaders, shepherds, and other poor folk going about their work. However, they were not above taking livestock such as sheep when they had the chance, nor raiding caravans that were lightly defended, on isolated trails, and far from aid. Their population was too small to make many enemies among the city-dwellers. They still had a reputation as dangerous raiders, and were seen as savage bandits by their neighbors. They hired themselves as guides to outsiders traveling the Evermoors, and were skilled at evading or defeating its monstrous dangers.\nOtherwise, they followed most common Uthgardt traditions and beliefs.\nMembers tattooed their foreheads with the symbol of elk horns.\nA gesture of great gratitude among the Elk tribe was to smear ones blood on the face of ones rescuer.\nIn the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the Elk tribe was led by Chief Zokan Thunderer, whom many considered a rude and ugly brute but also perhaps the most cunning, wealthiest, and most hated and feared bandit king in the North. There was a reward for his head, but he was hard to catch, let alone kill. He was well-protected by his warriors and a shaman. The tribe had two shamans Berchtwald Bandylegs venerated the Elk totem and Trothgar Grunald led worship of Auril.\nIn the late 15 century DR, Rond Vaarson was great chief of the Elk tribe, an ancient warrior tired of battle yet clinging to life. Lesser chieftains waited for him to pass on so they could compete to take his place.\nthumb|left|250px|Overview of the Flint Rock burial mound, displaying the Elk in the center.\nThe tribal totem was the Elk, Shamans of the Elk totem possessed a beast power known as the Horns of Wisdom this was similar to commune, but had the side-effect of elk antlers sprouting from the shamans skull. Every use of the power (usable once a day) made the horns grow further.\nHowever, in the 1300s DR, much of the Elk tribe worshiped other gods, Aurils deep influence over the Elk tribe and turning them away from the Elk earned her Uthgars ire. They seemed to have abandoned these gods and returned to the Elk totem in the late 1400s DR, however.\nDuring the mid-to-late 14 century DR, the tribe had gained loose ties with the leaders of Luskan, but they had few other friends.\nBy 1372 DR, the Elk tribe were considered one of the better Uthgardt tribes, at least in regards to settlers and city-dwellers of the Savage Frontier. Neither friends nor enemies, so long as the frontier did not encroach on their lands, they directed their ire elsewhere, to monsters and orcs and others. However this contradicts other accounts that claim the Elk tribe was no better than bandits during this time.\nIn ancient times, early followers of Uthgar who would found the Elk tribe interred a magical giant-crafted spearhead—a massive piece of mithral weighing  and  in length—under the altar at Flint Rock to empower the ancestral mound.\nOnce a proud people, the Elk tribe joined the Uthgardt Alliance These Uthgardt were tasked, in the , with hunting down and killing as many orc chieftains as possible. Twenty were eliminated over the next five years, preventing the formation of a horde. For another 80 years, the Alliance went from victory to victory over orc and goblinoid forces despite heavy losses. Notably, during the Goblin Wars in 753 DR, the Covenant forces drove the goblinoids out of Mirabar. Finally, they stood against an army of goblins and orcs led by ogres that marched out of the Evermoors in the . Though the Uthgardt defeated the horde, the Elk tribe warriors were nearly annihilated when they defended the Flintrock ancestral mound. The loss of the Uthgardt warriors and the suffering of the tribes led to the dissolution of the Alliance over the following five years.\nIn the aftermath, the Elk tribe was close to dying out. Though they survived, they eventually became not much more than brigands\nthumb|350px|The Elk tribe and Cult of the Dragon clash, as Rakor swoops overhead. Note the Elk totem in the middle.\nthumb|250px|The thick of the fighting between the Elk tribe and Dragon Cultists.\nYet they would rise to heroic defense once more. On the Evermoors sometime around 1400 DR, the Elk tribe battled the Cult of the Dragon for control of the helmet of disjunction, a relic with the power to break all magic, which was in the possession of the Elk chief Stanhard Grimwulf. In the conflict known as the Battle of the Evermoors, the Elk warriors outnumbered the Dragon Cultists, but they had the black dragon Rakor on their side and vomiting acid on the barbarians ranks. Stanhard ordered a retreat and entrusted the helmet to his fastest rider, Ven Salafin, to carry to safety, before the chief was dissolved as well. Ven passed it to Xenk Yendar as he too died, and the paladin would remember the Elk tribes brave sacrifice in defense of the helm. The fallen Elk tribesmen were buried at a sacred burial ground on the site.Its unknown how and why the Elk tribe had the helmet of disjunction, nor why the Cult of the Dragon wanted it beyond its magical and monetary value. The product description for the Rakor Nerf blaster toy describes Rakor as unleashing acid breath on adventures who dared challenge him or touch his treasure, which is perhaps meant to imply the Elk tribe stole the Helmet from his hoard. This at least fits the Elk tribes usual habits.\nFinally, in the mid–15 century DR, the armies of Mithral Hall and Nesmé broke the strength of the Elk tribe, ending their persistent raiding. In the decades after, though they recovered their numbers, they focused largely on hunting and foraging.\nThe elf explorer Aedyn Graymantle managed a peaceable meeting with a band of Elk tribesfolk led by Gyrt—aided in large part by them at first fearing her to be a powerful wizard, her greeting to them in Bothii, her valuable gifts, and her reassurance she was not in fact a wizard. Aedyn befriended Gyrt and through her learned much of Uthgardt and Elk culture.\nNevertheless, the Elk tribe continued to trouble the people of the Dessarin valley in the late 15 century DR. In the , a wandering band of Elk barbarians arrived in the Westwood, drove out some bandits there, occupied the woodcutters camps, and began to hunt and explore. They were no friends of the elemental cults at Rivergard Keep and Scarlet Moon Hall.\n* Chief Zokan Thunderer, chieftain of the tribe by 1357 DR.\n* Berchtwald Bandyleg, shaman of the Elk totem by 1357 DR.\n* Chief Stanhard Grimwulf, who led the tribe against the Cult of the Dragon circa 1400 DR.\n* Holga Kilgore, a thief and adventurer of the late 1400s DR."
