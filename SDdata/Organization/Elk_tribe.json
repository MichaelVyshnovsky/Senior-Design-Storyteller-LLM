        "mainbody": "The '''Elk tribe''' was an [[Uthgardt]] [[barbarian]] tribe of the [[Silver Marches]].",
        "Lands": "The Elk tribe's [[ancestral mound]] was the [[Flint Rock]],The original 1{{st}}-edition sourcebook ''The Savage Frontier'' and the 2{{nd}}-edition ''The North'' spell it as \"Flintrock\", whereas the 3{{rd}}-edition ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' spells it \"Flint Rock\". Later sources use this form. though by 1357 DR they'd largely abandoned it. Without the faithful to upkeep it, it fell into a decrepit state.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1300s DR, the tribe typically ranged over the [[Evermoors]], the plains east of the [[River Dessarin]], and along the [[Dessarin Valley|Dessarin]] and the lower [[Surbrin Valley|Surbrin]] valleys, as well as in the [[Lurkwood]].<ref> In the late 1400s DR, they held roughly the same amount of territory, considering the Dessarin Valley their territory and roaming the Evermoors and the lands north of the Dessarin between [[Noanar's Hold]] and [[Yartar]], exploring the [[Westwood]] and [[Sumber Hills]] and even as far as [[Mithral Hall]] and [[Nesmé]].",
        "Culture": "[[File:Holga Kilgore.png|thumb|right|250px|''Holga Kilgore, an exiled warrior of the Elk tribe.'']]\nIn the mid-to-late 1300s DR, the Elk tribe were seen as the most arrogant, ill-tempered, and self-indulgent of the Uthgardt tribes and they were regarded by most as little more than raiders and pillagers. They regularly raided caravans and villages, even those of other tribes for food, for women, and just for the fun of it. They carried away prisoners to ransom, but if the ransom wasn't enough for their liking, they kept the ransom money and sold the prisoner to slavers.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, the Elk tribe completely shunned all aspects of \"civilized\" society. They avoided towns and cities, and typically did not bother homesteaders, shepherds, and other poor folk going about their work. However, they were not above taking livestock such as [[sheep]] when they had the chance, nor raiding caravans that were lightly defended, on isolated trails, and far from aid. Their population was too small to make many enemies among the city-dwellers. They still had a reputation as dangerous raiders, and were seen as savage bandits by their neighbors. They hired themselves as guides to outsiders traveling the Evermoors, and were skilled at evading or defeating its monstrous dangers.\n\nOtherwise, they followed most common Uthgardt traditions and beliefs.\n\nMembers tattooed their foreheads with the symbol of elk horns.\n\nA gesture of great gratitude among the Elk tribe was to smear one's blood on the face of one's rescuer.",
        "Leadership": "In the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Elk tribe was led by Chief [[Zokan Thunderer]], whom many considered a rude and ugly brute but also perhaps the most cunning, wealthiest, and most hated and feared bandit king in the North. There was a reward for his head, but he was hard to catch, let alone kill. He was well-protected by his warriors and a shaman. The tribe had two [[shaman]]s: [[Berchtwald Bandylegs]] venerated the Elk totem and [[Trothgar Grunald]] led worship of Auril.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century DR, [[Rond Vaarson]] was great chief of the Elk tribe, an ancient warrior tired of battle yet clinging to life. Lesser chieftains waited for him to pass on so they could compete to take his place.",
        "Religion": "[[File:Flint Rock SKT.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Overview of the Flint Rock burial mound, displaying the Elk in the center.'']]\nThe tribal totem was the [[Uthgar|Elk]], Shamans of the Elk totem possessed a beast power known as the Horns of Wisdom; this was similar to ''[[commune]]'', but had the side-effect of elk antlers sprouting from the shaman's skull. Every use of the power (usable once a day) made the horns grow further.\n\nHowever, in the 1300s DR, much of the Elk tribe worshiped other gods, Auril's deep influence over the Elk tribe and turning them away from the Elk earned her Uthgar's ire. They seemed to have abandoned these gods and returned to the Elk totem in the late 1400s DR, however.",
        "Relations": "During the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the tribe had gained loose ties with the leaders of [[Luskan]], but they had few other friends.\n\nBy [[1372 DR]], the Elk tribe were considered one of the 'better' Uthgardt tribes, at least in regards to settlers and city-dwellers of the Savage Frontier. Neither friends nor enemies, so long as the frontier did not encroach on their lands, they directed their ire elsewhere, to monsters and orcs and others.<ref> However this contradicts other accounts that claim the Elk tribe was no better than bandits during this time.",
        "History": "In ancient times, early followers of Uthgar who would found the Elk tribe interred a magical [[giant]]-crafted spearhead—a massive piece of [[mithral]] weighing {{SI|75|lb|k|long=yes}} and {{SI|5|feet|long=yes}} in length—under the altar at Flint Rock to empower the ancestral mound.\n\nOnce a proud people, the Elk tribe joined the [[Uthgardt Alliance]] These Uthgardt were tasked, in the {{YearlinkName|715}}, with hunting down and killing as many [[orc]] chieftains as possible. Twenty were eliminated over the next five years, preventing the formation of a horde. For another 80 years, the Alliance went from victory to victory over orc and goblinoid forces despite heavy losses. Notably, during the [[Goblin Wars]] in [[753 DR]], the Covenant forces drove the goblinoids out of [[Mirabar]]. Finally, they stood against an army of [[goblin]]s and orcs led by [[ogre]]s that marched out of the Evermoors in the {{YearlinkName|775}}. Though the Uthgardt defeated the horde, the Elk tribe warriors were nearly annihilated when they defended the Flintrock ancestral mound. The loss of the Uthgardt warriors and the suffering of the tribes led to the dissolution of the Alliance over the following five years.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Elk tribe was close to dying out. Though they survived, they eventually became not much more than brigands\n\n[[File:Elk tribe and Rakor.png|thumb|350px|''The Elk tribe and Cult of the Dragon clash, as Rakor swoops overhead. Note the Elk totem in the middle.'']]\n[[File:Battle of the evermoors.png|thumb|250px|''The thick of the fighting between the Elk tribe and Dragon Cultists.'']]\nYet they would rise to heroic defense once more. On the Evermoors sometime around [[1400 DR]], the Elk tribe battled the [[Cult of the Dragon]] for control of the ''[[helmet of disjunction]]'', a relic with the power to break all [[magic]],{{Cite video/Honor Among Thieves}} which was in the possession of the Elk chief [[Stanhard Grimwulf]]. In the conflict known as the [[Battle of the Evermoors]], the Elk warriors outnumbered the Dragon Cultists, but they had the [[black dragon]] [[Rakor]] on their side and vomiting [[acid]] on the barbarians' ranks. Stanhard ordered a retreat and entrusted the helmet to his fastest rider, [[Ven Salafin]], to carry to safety, before the chief was dissolved as well. Ven passed it to [[Xenk Yendar]] as he too died, and the [[paladin]] would remember the Elk tribe's brave sacrifice in defense of the helm. The fallen Elk tribesmen were buried at a [[Evermoors cemetery|sacred burial ground on the site]].<ref group=\"note\">It's unknown how and why the Elk tribe had the ''helmet of disjunction'', nor why the Cult of the Dragon wanted it beyond its magical and monetary value. The product description for the [[w:c:nerf:Rakor|Rakor Nerf blaster toy]] describes Rakor as unleashing acid breath on adventures who dared challenge him or touch his treasure, which is perhaps meant to imply the Elk tribe stole the Helmet from his hoard. This at least fits the Elk tribe's usual habits.\n\nFinally, in the mid–15{{th}} century DR, the armies of Mithral Hall and Nesmé broke the strength of the Elk tribe, ending their persistent raiding. In the decades after, though they recovered their numbers, they focused largely on hunting and foraging.\n\nThe [[elf]] explorer [[Aedyn Graymantle]] managed a peaceable meeting with a band of Elk tribesfolk led by [[Gyrt]]—aided in large part by them at first fearing her to be a powerful wizard, her greeting to them in [[Bothii]], her valuable gifts, and her reassurance she was not in fact a wizard. Aedyn befriended Gyrt and through her learned much of Uthgardt and Elk culture.\n\nNevertheless, the Elk tribe continued to trouble the people of the Dessarin valley in the late 15{{th}} century DR.<ref> In the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, a wandering band of Elk barbarians arrived in the Westwood, drove out some bandits there, occupied the woodcutters' camps, and began to hunt and explore. They were no friends of the elemental cults at [[Rivergard Keep]] and [[Scarlet Moon Hall]].",
