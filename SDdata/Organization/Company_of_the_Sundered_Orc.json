        "mainbody": "The '''Company of the Sundered Orc''' was the name of one or two [[adventuring companies]] active on the [[Sword Coast]] in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite dragon/227/The Reports from Undermountain|16}}{{Cite web/Return to Undermountain/Room 20: Librarium}}<ref group=\"note\">The Company of the Sundered Orc was mentioned twice, in \"The Reports from Undermountain\" and ''Return to Undermountain'', both times as adventuring companies that explored Undermountain and were not seen again, but with contradictory times, places, and fates. ''Return'' (dated 1373 DR) puts it \"over ten years ago\", ''i.e.'', before [[1363 DR]], but \"Reports\" is set in 1368 DR. The former is on first level, the latter on the second. ''Return'' suggests they may have died and risen as [[ghost]]s, but \"Reports\" has been them captured by drow. While this might be the same company, \"Reports\" says they are \"relatively new\", which may not suit a group of five years' experience. It is possible these are two separate companies with coincidentally the same name, that the second company was reformed from surviving members of the first company, or that the ''Return'' event should be more recent than 1368 DR. Regardless, this article covers both adventuring companies.",
        "Organization": "The company had five members ''circa'' 1368 DR:\n* [[Lorar|Lorar the Slayer]], a [[human]] [[fighter]];\n* [[Pelops]], a.k.a. Shadowstriker, a [[halfling]] [[thief]];\n* [[Jared Rheloph]], \"the Pious\", a human [[cleric]] of [[Ilmater]];\n* [[Cassandra Rulmac]], a [[half-elf]] fighter and [[wizard]]; and\n* [[Wynara Rulmac]], a human wizard.",
        "History": {
            "First Company": "In the early 1360s DR, the Company of the Sundered Orc had started exploring the dungeons of [[Undermountain]]. On their first expedition, they discovered the [[Librarium]] on the first level, called the [[Dungeon Level]], and returned alive to boast about its wonders. They kept its precise location to themselves, however, and arranged for several porters to join them on their next expedition to carry out its vast and eclectic collection of [[book]]s and [[scroll]]s. They were not seen again as of [[1373 DR]] and had presumably died there.",
            "Second Company": "The five [[adventurer]]s—Lorar, Pelops, Jared, Cassandra, and Wynara—came together in [[Daggerford]] relatively recently as of 1368 DR and soon headed for [[Waterdeep]], not yet even having a name for their company. ''En route'', they encountered a small [[orc]] raiding band and destroyed them, so they named themselves for this event.\n\nIn Waterdeep, they went to the [[Yawning Portal]] inn and began exploring the dungeons of Undermountain as adventurers do. In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, they elected to locate a supposed treasure hoard on the second level, the [[Arcane Chambers]], which the Waterdhavian merchant-adventurer [[Essimuth Lanys]] claimed to have sighted. They ventured down the well just after sunset on [[Eleint 2]], and had not yet returned by the end of the month. The [[Tymoran]] priest [[Adama Miiralin]] stationed at the inn recorded this in his monthly report to High Priestess [[Seenroas Halvinhar]].\n\nIn fact, all five of them had been captured by [[drow]] [[slavery|slavers]] in the Arcane Chambers and were soon to be transported to [[Skullport]]."
