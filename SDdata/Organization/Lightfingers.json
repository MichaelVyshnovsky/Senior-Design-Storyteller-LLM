        "mainbody": "The Lightfingers was the only thieves guild of note in the city of Yhep along the Lake of Steam during the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nThe familial members of the Lightfingers preferred to rob the homes of wealthy citizens of Yhep when they werent home. They rarely accosted victims directly on the street like petty criminals.\nThe roots of the Lightfingers began with a feud between the Dabichi and Harauntan families of Yhep during the late 13 century DR. A member of the Harauntans cheated a Dabichi out of their inheritence, leaving the family on hard times and eventually costing them their status as nobles. The Dabichis swore vengeance after that act and turned to stealing what they needed to make ends meet."
