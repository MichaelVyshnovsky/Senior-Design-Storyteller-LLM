The '''Spirit Warriors''' were a group of [[Lesser Immortals]] of the [[Celestial Bureaucracy]], the dominant faith of [[Kara-Tur]]. They served [[Chan Cheng]], the god of war.

The Spirit Warriors had the duties of creating courage and resolve in those who wavered, and leading armies of phantoms, the manifestation of which could swing a battle. Spirit Warriors also helped those who'd fallen in battle for a good cause, escorted the spirits of heroes for judgement by the [[Lords of Karma]], and guarded the gates of the [[Underworld]] against trespassers.
