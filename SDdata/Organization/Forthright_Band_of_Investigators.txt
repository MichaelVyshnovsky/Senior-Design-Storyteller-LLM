The Forthright Band of Investigators, or FBI, was an order of paladins in Waterdeep devoted to Juris, god of law and prudence.
The order investigated various criminal activities in and under Waterdeep, and this led them to discover the wide-ranging criminal organizations of the Underdark that influenced politics and trade. Their criminal dossier, Waterdeeps Most Wanted, contained detailed profiles of underworld figures assembled by the renowned sage Gerald of Riveyra such as the crime bosses Da Pen and Felyndiira Shinarrvha, advisor Tortello, illithid businessman Dutch, the fence Gnormahlenvaey Catoneriehn, and the hit-men Vikhrumn Coll and the Fiddler.
