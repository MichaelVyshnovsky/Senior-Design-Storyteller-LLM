The '''Forthright Band of Investigators''', or '''FBI''', was an order of [[paladin]]s in [[Waterdeep]] devoted to [[Juris]], god of law and prudence.

==Activities==
The order investigated various criminal activities in and under Waterdeep, and this led them to discover the wide-ranging criminal organizations of the [[Underdark]] that influenced politics and trade. Their criminal dossier, ''[[Waterdeep's Most Wanted]]'', contained detailed profiles of underworld figures assembled by the renowned sage [[Gerald of Riveyra]] such as the crime bosses [[Da Pen]] and [[Felyndiira Shi'narrvha]], advisor [[Tortello]], [[illithid]] businessman [[Brikhalna Ipprszhen|Dutch]], the fence [[Gnormahlenvaey Catoneriehn]], and the hit-men [[Vikhrumn Coll]] and [[Gray'shivnarien Taliain|the Fiddler]].

==Members==
* [[Jayed Garhoov'r]], master of the FBI.
* Sir [[Elliot of Kness]], a driven [[paladin]].
* Master [[Furli]], Elliot's incompetent squire.
* [[Vanyard the Fox]], an eccentric investigator.
* [[Danna the Skull]], a clinical [[anatomist]] style of [[necromancer]].
