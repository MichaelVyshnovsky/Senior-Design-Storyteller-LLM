The Champions Vigilant was a Tethyrian knightly order of Helm. These fighters, clerics and paladins were prestigious and popular throughout the realm. The order had fortified bases dotting the countryside, such as in Survale Ford, and cities like Velen and Saradush.
The order was founded in 1164 DR, during the reign of King Coram III. They served the kingdom valiantly during the Tethyrian Interregnum, saving thousands of lives from bandits and corrupt despots.
