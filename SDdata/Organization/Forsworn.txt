The Forsworn were a group of Uthgardt barbarians that splintered off from the greater Gray Wolf tribe for much of the 15 century DR. They went against their fellow tribespeople when the Gray Wolf leaders aligned their tribe with the dark sorcerers of returned Netheril.
The Forsworn dedicated themselves to dismantling Netherese operations in the lands around Vellosk. They took any opportunity they could to slay any agent of the Shadovar.
The Forsworn held their main camp near the Gray Wolf settlement of Vellosk, and established second, more secluded camp near the enclave of Xinlenal.
In the late 14 century DR, the Shadovar returned to Toril and reformed the empire of Netheril. The arcanists of the Shadowfell drew in followers from among the native Faerûnians, most notably the Gray Wolf tribe of the Sword Coast North. Tribe members that embraced lycanthropy as werewolves were utilized as the vanguard for the growing Netherese army. This led to tremendous casualties among the tribespeople, and many were left disillusioned. A select group of the Gray Wolf tribe attempted to rebel against their Netherese overlords but were quickly turned away. Rather than being killed outright, they were cast out by their fellow tribespeople―forced to live just beyond the borders of their ancestral home―and declared the Forsworn.
Some time around the , Thalos Oathbreaker reached out to Sergeant Alphonse Knox of the Neverwinter Guard, seeking assistance with the reclamation of Gray Wolf Den from the Shadovar-aligned tribes members. Around that same time, the Forsworn shaman Kyrn Whitesky received a vision that a great hero would come to their aide. Eventually the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge came to Thalos and helped consecrate the remains of slain Forsworn tribes members, before leading an assault against the Shadovar-aligned barbarians at Gray Wolf Den.
