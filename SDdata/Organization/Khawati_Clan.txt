The '''Khawati Clan''' was a clan of [[desert centaur]]s inhabiting the [[Burning Lands]] of [[interior Zakhara]] around [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}

==Activities==
As of 1367 DR, the clan was engaged in raids and strikes against a religious cult called the [[Shorn]] based in nearby [[Moradask]]. These raids were retaliation for the abduction of the clan's leader [[Tebessa al-Khawati]]. 

==Base of Operations==
Though all desert centaurs roamed the desert, the Khawati Clan kept to the rough borders of the Burning Lands and the [[Sea of Salt]] along the northern fringes of the [[Great Anvil]].

==Members==
Tebessa al-Khawati was the clan leader in 1367 DR. Her older sister, [[Narur al-Khawati|Narur]] was the clan's priestess and waterfinder.
