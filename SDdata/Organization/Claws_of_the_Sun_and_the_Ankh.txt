The '''Claws of the Sun and the Ankh''' were an order of fearless [[Mulhorand]]i [[paladin]]s of [[Horus-Re]], who devote themselves to their divine responsibilities rather than politics of the nation. They acted in fanatical pursuit of the followers of [[Set]], and were granted divine powers to ''smite'' any whom they encountered.

They were the first paladin order of Mulhorand that were dedicated to a deity other than [[Osiris]].

==Abilities==
Paladins of the Sun and the Ankh were able to draw upon the divine power of Horus-Re and partially transform themselves, turning their hands into claws of a [[hawk]].
