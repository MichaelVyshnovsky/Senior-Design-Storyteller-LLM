The Gray Doom were a disbanded mercenary company around 1358 DR.
The Gray Doom earned a reputation in the Sword Coast for their skill and swiftness in skirmishes.
During the war against the arcanaloth Yrkhetep, they sided with the forces of good and were decisive in the victory of the Battle of Thurgabanteth in Chondath. However, they were placed on the blacklists of many evil groups for this.
Two years later, the Chill ambushed the Gray Doom and destroyed them.
