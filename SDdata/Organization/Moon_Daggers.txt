The Moon Daggers were a gang organized by Myrkyssa Jelan in 1479 DR shortly after she escaped her imprisonment in the mythal beneath Ravens Bluff.
The gang attempted to recover the Sarkonagael spellbook in the ruined dwarven city of Sarbreen beneath Ravens Bluff but were slightly slower than Jack Ravenwild and his hirelings, the Blue Wyverns, who beat the Moon Daggers to the book.
Later, Myrkyssa and the Moon Daggers helped to defeat an attack by the slaver Fetterfist and his drow allies on a noble revel.
