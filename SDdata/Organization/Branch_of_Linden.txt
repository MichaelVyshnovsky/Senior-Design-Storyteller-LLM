The '''Branch of Linden''' was a [[human]] supremacist organization operating out of [[Tethyr]] in the late 1400s [[DR]].

==Activities==
It was composed of supporters of [[Evonne Linden]] and her revolt against her half-sister [[Anais Rhindaun]] as queen of Tethyr. The Branch of Linden worked to overthrow the queen and install Evonne's daughter [[Ysabel Linden]] on the throne. 

==History==
Following the [[Children's Massacre]] in the {{yearlink|1469}} and the death of Evonne Linden, Anais's own grandfather [[Reinhold]] blamed Anais and created the Branch of Linden.

After several skirmishes between the queen's army and the Branch of Linden, with the last and worst on the [[Ebenspy Plateau]], the rebels retreated into [[Ebenspy Keep]]. After several days of siege, half of them died with a coughing sickness and the queen's soldiers broke the siege and seized the castle, defeating the Branch of Linden. The leaders were hanged before the High Palace at [[Darromar]].

After that, the Branch of Linden were believed to be wiped out.
