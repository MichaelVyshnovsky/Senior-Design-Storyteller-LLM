        "mainbody": "The Sweetwater Traders, or simply Sweetwater, were a shipping and transport company operating in the Delimbiyr Vale in the mid-to-late 14 century DR. The company was owned by Mathias Rylin. They were named for the minty-sweet waters of the Delimbiyr River.\nSweetwater focused its efforts on transporting goods and produce along the Delimbiyr Vale, between the four major settlements of Daggerford, Secomber, Loudwater, and Llorkh, with occasional forays to Waterdeep. While dealing in Llorkh meant dealing with the Zhentarim, they were not known to ever carry contraband, drugs, poisons, or slaves. They had a reputation for reliability.\nTheir symbol was a waterfall in profile—most likely the Shining Falls—from which four motes of light rose. This was ringed by a circle formed from the names of their principle stops Daggerford, Secomber, Loudwater, and Llorkh. These symbols were displayed in gold paint on the sides of the wagons in their caravans."
