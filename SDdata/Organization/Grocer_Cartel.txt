The '''Grocer Cartel''' was a powerful guild of traders and retailers that influenced the food trade in ancient [[Netheril]].

==Activities==
The guild was led in a fair but unflinching manner by [[Ravenar Andarlis]], who also owned [[Andarlis Transport]]. It had a heavy influence on the trade and transport of food in Netheril, and helped regulate prices and the economy in general. In [[Yeoman's Loft]], it took a particular role in controlling the flow of goods acquired via [[spelljamming]] expeditions, which were often hotly competed for.

==Base of Operations==
The guild's headquarters was found on [[Helm Road]] in Yeoman's Loft, and owned many other locations in that city and elsewhere, including [[Eileanar]].
