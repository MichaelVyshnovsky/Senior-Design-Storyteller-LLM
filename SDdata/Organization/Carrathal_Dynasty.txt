The Carrathal dynasty was a noble family who were High Kings and Queens of Callidyrr in the Moonshae Isles.
The Carrathals could trace their lineage all the way back to the legendary hero and first High King of Moonshae, Cymrych Hugh. However, many regarded him as more of a mythical than historical figure by the time of Carrathal rule.
The Carrathal dynasty began in the , with the reign of High King Niall, who was born as a prince to the Cymrych dynasty of High Kings. However, that dynasty was already in decline by the time of his birth owing to the loss of the Crown of the High King by his great-great-grandfather in a battle against the Northmen. The familys authority truly collapsed during the reign of his father, when the northern isles of Moonshae were ceded to the Northmen and the familys only remaining symbol of office, the Sword of Cymrych Hugh, was lost to firbolgs. Thus, when Niall took the throne at the familys seat in Caer Callidyrr, he did so as king of Callidyrr only. He changed the name of the family from "Cymrych" to "Carrathal", which was part of a general trend by the royal families of the Moonshaes to shift the spelling and pronunciations of their names to distance themselves from the mythical Cymrych Hugh name.
The Carrathals would rule Callidyrr for four centuries until the time of High King Reginald, who was betrayed and manipulated by his evil advisor, Cyndre, and ultimately deposed by the hero Tristan Kendrick in the .
