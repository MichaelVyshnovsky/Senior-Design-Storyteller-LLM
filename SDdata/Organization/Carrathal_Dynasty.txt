The '''Carrathal''' dynasty was a noble family who were High Kings and Queens of [[Callidyrr]] in the [[Moonshae Isles]].{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|33}}

==History==
The Carrathals could trace their lineage all the way back to the legendary hero and first High King of Moonshae, [[Cymrych Hugh]]. However, many regarded him as more of a mythical than historical figure by the time of Carrathal rule.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|31}}

The Carrathal dynasty began in the {{YearlinkName|944}}, with the reign of High King [[Niall Carrathal|Niall]], who was born as a prince to the Cymrych dynasty of High Kings. However, that dynasty was already in decline by the time of his birth owing to the loss of the ''[[Crown of the High King]]'' by his [[Dolan Cymrych|great-great-grandfather]] in a battle against the [[Northmen]]. The family's authority truly collapsed during the reign of [[Tanner Cymrych|his father]], when the northern isles of Moonshae were ceded to the Northmen and the family's only remaining symbol of office, the ''[[Sword of Cymrych Hugh]]'', was lost to [[firbolg]]s.{{Cite dragon/362/Grand History of the Realms: The Moonshaes|27}} Thus, when Niall took the throne at the family's seat in [[Caer Callidyrr]], he did so as king of Callidyrr only. He changed the name of the family from "Cymrych" to "Carrathal", which was part of a general trend by the royal families of the Moonshaes to shift the spelling and pronunciations of their names to distance themselves from the mythical Cymrych Hugh name.

The Carrathals would rule Callidyrr for four centuries until the time of High King [[Reginald Carrathal|Reginald]], who was betrayed and manipulated by his evil advisor, [[Cyndre]], and ultimately deposed by the hero [[Tristan Kendrick]] in the {{YearlinkName|1346}}.{{Cite dragon/405/Heroes of the Moonshaes|5}}

==Notable Members==
* [[Niall Carrathal]] (901-954 DR), who changed the family name from Cymrych to Carrathal to mark its transition from ruling the Ffolk to ruling only the Kingdom of Callidyrr.
* [[Bayle Carrathal]] (1005-1052 DR), who was overthrown by [[Yolanda Carrathal|a cousin]] after a humiliating conflict with [[Baldur's Gate]], ending the direct male line of the dynasty.
* [[Rieger Carrathal]] (1238-? DR), whose reign ended when he disappeared without a trace in the {{YearlinkName|1273}}.
* [[Reginald Carrathal]] (1312-1346 DR), who was the last Carrathal to sit the throne in Callidyrr.
* [[Lionel Carrathal]] (1355-1413 DR), the successor to the dynasty at the turn of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]] who attempted to overthrow the Kendrick Dynasty.
