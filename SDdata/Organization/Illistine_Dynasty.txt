The '''Illistine Dynasty''' ruled over the city-state of [[Westgate]] from the {{YearlinkName|429}}, until {{YearlinkName|452}}. The Illistine reign began when [[Mulsantir Illistine I|Mulsantir Illistine]] drove the last pirate king out of Westgate and claimed the throne for himself, becoming King Mulsantir I. The [[Illistine]] family only held the throne for two generations before a period of violent upheaval when their line was replaced by others who seized the throne by force.
