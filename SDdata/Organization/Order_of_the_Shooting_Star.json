        "mainbody": "The '''Order of the Shooting Star''' was an order of [[ranger]]s dedicated to [[Mystra]], goddess of [[magic]]. A member of the order was known as a '''Shooting Star'''.",
        "Organization": "The Order of the Shooting Star was sponsored by the church of Mystra.''[[Faiths & Avatars]]'' presents the Knights of the Mystic Fire and the  Order of the Shooting Star as separate organizations each sponsored by the church. ''[[Champions of Valor]]'', page 34, says they are closely allied, while page 102 discusses them together and says the rangers of the Order are members of the Knights, suggesting they are a sub-organization.\n\nLike the Knights, they worked in small groups; it was rare to find more than a dozen in any one place.",
        "Activities": "The Shooting Stars operated as long-range scouts and spies on behalf of the church of Mystra. In particular, they hunted and dealt with magical, monstrous threats to the natural order of the world, like rogue [[fiend]]s, rampaging monsters, and creatures created by reckless magical experiments.",
        "Powers": "Mystra granted [[divine magic]] to the rangers of the order. However, they also studied [[arcane magic]]. As such, the Shooting Star had a closer affinity with arcane magic, potentially being able to cast arcane [[spell]]s and having an increased capacity for magic. They could also learn ''[[invisibility]]'' and ''[[word of recall]]''. Using an ability called \"Weavespeak\", a Shooting Star could also communicate their findings to the nearest [[cleric]], [[paladin]], or fellow ranger of Mystra, over any distance, by transmitting [[sending|short messages]] over the [[Weave]]."
