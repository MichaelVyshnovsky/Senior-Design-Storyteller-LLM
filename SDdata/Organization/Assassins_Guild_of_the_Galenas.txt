The '''Assassins Guild of the Galenas''', also called the '''Citadel of Assassins''', was an [[assassin]]s [[guild]] based in the [[Galena Mountains]] in [[Damara]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
The Guild was once loyal to [[Zhengyi]], the Witch-King, and remained an enemy to the throne of the [[Bloodstone Lands]].<ref>

In the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, [[Bregan D'aerthe]], under the orders of [[Jarlaxle]] (and with the consent of [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]]) easily infiltrated a base of the guild and forcefully recruited Knellict as an ally, thus bringing the Citadel of Assassins under the influence of the [[drow]] mercenary organization.

==Organization==
As of [[1372 DR]], the leader of the guild was [[Timoshenko]], the [[Grandfather of Assassins]], who played the political face of the organization. His chief lieutenant, the wizard [[Knellict]], carried out the dirty work.

==Base of Operations==
After the fall of Zhengyi, the Citadel was chased from [[Heliogabalus]]. They took refuge in a complex of caverns in the mountainside of the [[Galena Mountains]], east of the [[Vaasan Gate]]. Suites of rooms reach far back into the mountain, some carved by hired stone masons and miners, many others created by Knellict's magic. The caves are full of comforts and treasures, inviting aromas and magically lit walkways. Knellict and his wizards created and maintain a series of magical portals to strategic locations within Gareth's kingdom.

===Notable Members===
* [[Athrogate]], a dwarven warrior
* [[Canthan Doolittle]], a human wizard
* [[Ellery Dragonsbane]], a relative of [[Gareth Dragonsbane]] and a commander of the Army of Bloodstone
* [[Felix]], a human soldier
* [[Knellict]], a human archmage and Timoshenko's lieutenant
* [[Timoshenko]], the Grandfather of Assassins and the Citadel's official leader
