The '''Cult of Frost''' was a criminal organization that was focused on acquiring the legendary [[artifact]], the ''[[Ring of Winter]].

==Organization==
The actual numbers of the cult remained a mystery. The organization itself, however, had presences in criminal underbellies of [[Tantras]], among others. The cult attracted a variety of followers, including the [[wizard]]s and scholars of the [[House of Oghma]]. The leaders of the cult knew a ritual of summoning [[ice golem]]s, a dangerous force of death and subterfuge.  These minions were used for spying and assassination. The golems were usually wrapped in black [[ninja]]-like clothing and used their own bodies as weapons. Laser-focused on their target, they felt no pain and had no self-preservation instinct. The main danger to the ice minions' existence was the heat. But even in the sweltering jungles of [[Chult]], they posed a grave danger.

==Relationships==
The Cult of Frost mainly operated independently from others. However it grew from the worship of [[Auril]] and was affiliated with the [[Church of Auril]].

==History==
It was unknown when the Cult of Frost was formed or even when Kaverin Ebonhand, the Butcher of Tantras, joined its ranks. In [[1357 DR]]

The cult became an even greater force of chaos following Kaverin Ebonhand's death at the hands of [[Artus Cimber]] and [[Hydel Pontifax]] in [[1360 DR]]. Ebonhand's ambition led him to strike a devil's bargain with [[Cyric]]. In exchange for returning to Toril, Kaverin was to sow chaos and strife in the name of the Mad God. However, the agreement had claws.  This meant that once Kaverin was to die, he was to be tortured by Cyric and his minions for eternity. With increased violence and chaos in the cult's wake, the Butcher of Tantras had even greater drive to find the ''Ring of Winter'' for its powers of immortality.

Under Kaverin's leadership, the Cult of Frost trailed Artus Cimber for years before [[1362 DR]]{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}}. Nemesis of Kaverin, Artus was on the same quest to find the legendary [[ring]] of [[Auril]]. Subsequently, the ring became rumored to be in [[Chult]]. An unfortunate explorer from the [[Society of Stalwart Adventurers]], [[Theron Silvermace]], discovered the ring's location. Artus embarked on the journey to Chult, and the Cult of Winter sent their icy assassins to  murder Silvermace.

After arriving in Chult, the cult sent another group of frost minions to assassinate Artus and Hydel Pontifax, searching for the ring. The ice golems killed Pontifax, and with Artus grieving, Ebonhand had a head start in the search. Subsequently, Ebonhand allied himself with the Queen [[M'bobo]] of cannibalistic [[Batiri]] [[goblin]]s. Together, the cult, Batiri, and a tribe of [[pterafolk]] laid a siege on the list city of [[Mezro]], the hiding place of the ''Ring of Winter''. dragged Ebonhand to his eternal torture.

The cult's activities after the siege of Mezro remained unknown.
