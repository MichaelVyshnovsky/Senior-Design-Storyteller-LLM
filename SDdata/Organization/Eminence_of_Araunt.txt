The '''Eminence of Araunt''' was a relatively new power in [[Toril]], although it was an ancient organization in [[Abeir]]. Brought to the world on the planeshifted continent of [[Laerakond]], The Eminence viewed itself as the de facto ruler of all [[undead]] across Toril.

==Organization==
The organization's headquarters were located in the catacombs of [[Nornglast]] in [[Eskorn]]. The region had a reputation for being haunted, and the Eminence used those stories to cover its activities. The Eminence believed that all its members were equals, but a few ones had higher positions than others.

While the organization was primarily made up by undead, it also employed a limited number of living allies, which it used as spies and traders to procure the exotic components required for the Eminence's [[ritual]]s. Most of Araunt's "citizens" were [[specter]]s and [[ghost]]s, called up by the Eminence's rituals. Both [[direhelm]]s and [[doomsept]]s were undead formed of several spirits, created to defend the Eminence's "principalities".

Araunt was hostile to all other cults and kingdoms of the undead, including [[Thay]]. Skirmishes were fought between the two major undead powers in the last decades of the 15th century [[DR]], with a full war brewing in the catacombs of the world. [[Vampire]]s, [[lich]]es and other strong-willed undead sometimes allied with Araunt, but rarely stayed with the organizations for any length of time.

==Activities==
Through a series of rituals The Eminence connected undead-only portals known as the ''[[deathway]]s'' to the catacombs and crypts of the world, raised the interred and declared them "principalities" of Araunt.

==History==
Founded some 500 years before [[1479 DR]], in the world of Abeir, the Eminence of Araunt got its start in an Eskornar [[dragon]]'s tomb where the [[bone naga]], [[Lod]], scribed the ''[[Codex of Araunt]]'' onto stone tablets. The ''Codex'' predicted the slow expansion of the "kingdom" over the centuries.

The Eminence of Araunt was brought to Toril on the continent of Laerakond during the [[Spellplague]]. The Eminence began to expand its operations on [[Faer√ªn]] in the decade of the [[1470 DR|1470s DR]], and went into conflict with other undead-only organizations and kingdoms.

In 1479 DR, the conflict between Thay and the Eminence escalated into a full war, and both factions used [[Rashemen]] as their battlefield. Although Lod was destroyed by the [[Brotherhood of the Griffon]] during a major battle, the Eminence endured thanks to the leadership of the undead [[lamia]] [[Meremoth]].

==Notable members==
* [[Lod]], the bone naga and founder of the Eminence.
* [[Meremoth]], an undead lamia and leader after Lod's destruction.
