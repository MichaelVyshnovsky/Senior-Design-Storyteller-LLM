        "mainbody": "The '''Harrowcoaster Coster''' was a trade organization based out of [[New Velar|Harrowdale]] specializing in the import of fine textile, glassware, and [[spices]].",
        "Base of Operations": "[[Harrowcoaster House]] served as the main office and warehouse for the coster. It was located near the docks in Harrowdale to allow for quick transport of their valuable goods from ships to the warehouse.",
        "Activites": "All incoming wares were moved to the warehouse under close guard where they were repacked into smaller wagon boxes or horse crates for transport through the [[Dalelands]] and [[Cormyr]]. The Harrowcoaster Coster previously dealt with exporting produce through the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], but trouble with the [[Treskeden Coster]] ended that endeavor. Since then they focused solely on exporting [[Old Smoke]] ale from [[Gunderman Brewery]].",
        "Members": "The coster was run by Captain [[Durana Shaleel]] in [[1367 DR]]."
