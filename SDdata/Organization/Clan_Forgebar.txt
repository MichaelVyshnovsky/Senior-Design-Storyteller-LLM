Clan Forgebar was a belligerent hill dwarf family dwelling in the Sword Mountains on the Sword Coast North.
They lived in a series of caves carved into the side of Mount Galardrym, just over  from the gnome-occupied valley of Felrenden.
They comprised sixty to seventy members, who were described as aggressive, savage, and quick to attack and even kill anyone who disagreed with them. Naturally, they were well-armed.
By 1372 DR, the clan had launched three attacks on the nearby gnome settlement of Ieirithymbul, but each time the participating dwarves were almost wiped out by its Unseen Protectorâ€”the gold dragon Palarandusk.
