'''Clan Forgebar''' was a belligerent [[hill dwarf]] family dwelling in the [[Sword Mountains]] on the [[Sword Coast North]].{{Cite dragon/252/Wyrms of the North: Palarandusk|70}}{{Cite web/Wyrms of the North/Palarandusk, "The Unseen Protector"}}

==Base==
They lived in a series of caves carved into the side of [[Mount Galardrym]], just over {{SI|10|mile|k|long=yes}} from the [[gnome]]-occupied valley of [[Felrenden]].

==Organization==
They comprised sixty to seventy members, who were described as aggressive, savage, and quick to attack and even kill anyone who disagreed with them. Naturally, they were well-armed.

==History==
By [[1372 DR]], the clan had launched three attacks on the nearby [[gnome]] settlement of [[Ieirithymbul]], but each time the participating dwarves were almost wiped out by its Unseen Protector—the [[gold dragon]] [[Palarandusk]].

==Notable Members==
* [[Dunstun Forgebar]], a priest of [[Vergadain]], member of the [[Council of Sparkling Stones]] of [[Mirabar]] in the 1360s DR
