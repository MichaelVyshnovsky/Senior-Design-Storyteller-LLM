The City Guard of Hafayah served as a police force within the city as well as the "City of Secrets" standing army.
The city guard was composed of 5,000 infantry, 1,200 cavalry, three units of mercenary barbarians totaling 1,800 men, two units from the Youthful Mamluk Society numbering 1,200 mamluks, and a fleet of ten ships.
The city guard maintained peace within the city. Though small, the ships of the fleet were quite fast. They patrolled the waters of the Great Sea near the coast as well as Al-Kufr River inland.
