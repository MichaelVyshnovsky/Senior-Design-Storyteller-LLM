The '''City Guard''' of [[Hafayah]] served as a police force within the city as well as the "City of Secrets'" standing army.

==Organization==
The city guard was composed of 5,000 infantry, 1,200 cavalry, three units of [[mercenary barbarian]]s totaling 1,800 men, two units from the [[Youthful Mamluk Society]] numbering 1,200 [[mamluk]]s, and a fleet of ten ships.

==Activities==
The city guard maintained peace within the city. Though small, the ships of the fleet were quite fast. They patrolled the waters of the [[Great Sea]] near the coast as well as [[Al-Kufr River]] inland.
