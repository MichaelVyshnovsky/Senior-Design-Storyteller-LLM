        "mainbody": "'''House Aelorothi''' was a [[gold elf]] noble house with holdings on [[Evermeet]] by the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were once a minor house of the realm of [[Siluvanede]] (c. {{Yearlink|-8400}} to [[882 DR]]).",
        "Livery": "The colors of the house were red and blue, while its crest depicted a red [[swan]] on a blue field.",
        "Home": "By [[1367 DR]], the family home was located in the northern part of the city of [[Leuthilspar]] on Evermeet. It was a tower, tall and slender, pale blue in color with green veins.",
        "Activities": "Traditionally, the Aelorothi elves served as priests and warrior-clerics to the elven gods of the [[Seldarine]], especially [[Corellon Larethian]]. Their numbers were much diminished by 1367 DR, but they still cared for Evermeet's temples and blessed elf [[fighter]]s and sailors.\n\nDespite this holy calling, the Aelorothi of ancient Siluvanede were among those minor houses corrupted by [[House Dlardrageth]] from around {{Yearlink|-4800}}. They joined in their elf–[[demon]] crossbreeding and spawned a bloodline of [[fey'ri]], and were complicit in the realm's warmongering, before being held captive for millennia. After their liberation in [[1369 DR]], the Aelorothi fey'ri became a subclan of House Dlardrageth and joined the [[daemonfey]] army of [[Sarya Dlardrageth]].\n\nCoincidentally, many of Aelorothi—gold elf or fey'ri—were noted spies.",
        "Possessions": "The family on Evermeet owned a number of precious magical items suited for [[cleric]]s, such as two ''[[rod of resurrection|rods of resurrection]]'' and the storied ''[[staff of Rumathil]]''.",
        "Notable Members": "Gold elf members included:\n* Mi'tilarro Aelorothi, a High Priest of [[Corellon Larethian]], present during the rise of Zaor Moonflower to be king of Evermeet.\n* [[Rennyn Aelorothi]], a spy for Queen [[Amlaruil Moonflower|Amlaruil]] in the late 1360s DR.\n\nFey'ri members included:\n* Lord [[Pharnth Aelorothi]], the patriarch of the Aelorothi fey'ri and spy for the daemonfey from [[1369 DR]];\n* Lady-Consort [[Saesaan Aelorothi]], his consort;\n* [[Jasrya Aelorothi]], a high-ranking [[bladesinger]];\n* [[Laelran Aelorothi]], a spy in the [[Arcane Brotherhood]];\n* [[Vesryn Aelorothi]], a [[sorcerer]] at the [[daemonfey bolthole]] and later spymaster of the daemonfey."
