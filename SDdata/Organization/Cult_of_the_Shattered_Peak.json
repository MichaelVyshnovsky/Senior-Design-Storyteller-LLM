        "mainbody": "The '''Cult of the Shattered Peak''' were [[Netherese]] descendents who watched constantly for those seeking what they believed should not be sought. They strove to keep the secrets of ancient [[Netheril]] out of the hands of others.",
        "History": "Formed sometime after the fall of ancient [[Netheril]],  the cult existed until at least [[1373]] DR.",
        "Dogma": "The stereotypical Netherese cult consisted of power-hungry [[wizard]]s bent on either resurrecting the Empire of Magic or on exploiting its secrets for their own aggrandizement.  The Cult of the Shattered Peak was the exact opposite; in their view, Faerûnians were better off leaving well enough alone.  They recalled the arcane hubris that was Netheril's downfall, not to mention its oppression of nonhumans, and fought to keep the old ways dead and buried. To this end they employed a myriad of tactics ranging from disinformation and theft to outright assassination.{{cite book/Lost Empires of Faerûn|10}}\n\nCultists mainly worked independently or as part of a cell system.  This protected the cult from reprisals.  A given cultist gave and received information to and from the one or two cultists they knew, or via dead drops.  They may also have been assigned to protect and assist other members without said members' knowledge.{{cite book/Lost Empires of Faerûn|11}}\n\nAbove all else, cultists valued information, and new members were given few orders besides \"Keep your eyes open\" and \"Report back when you find information of interest, especially concerning powerful magic or mages.\"",
        "Location": "The cult mainly operated within the [[Anauroch|Desert of Anauroch]], with several small cells throughout the [[Western Heartlands]]. The cult may have been active throughout Faerûn, because foolish, irresponsible, greedy and generally evil arcanists were found nearly everywhere.  It's known that the cult had less-than-friendly relations with the [[Zhentarim]], and the same could be true of the [[Red Wizard]]s.  Likewise, anywhere mages held political power ([[Rashemen]], the [[Vilhon Reach]], [[Waterdeep]], and so on), the cult may have been working in the shadows.{{cite book/Lost Empires of Faerûn|12}}\n\nThe stronghold of the Cult was in the southern portion of [[the Scimitar Spires]] mountain range. A mountain fortress was within the Shattered Peak protected by chasms and cliffs.",
        "Relationships": "Few people knew of the cult, and those who did tended to regard it as a group of mage-hating extremists.  Arcanists generally disliked them, but most others individuals had little opinion either way.  However, the cult often interfered with [[Zhentarim]] wizards in the Anauroch, so members of the Black Network were almost always hostile toward known cultists.\n\nCultists regarded [[magelord]]s as cruel and dangerous (a not entirely unjustified sentiment), and magelords generally returned the prejudice.\n\nThe [[Bedine]] nomads, however, were allies of the cult and regularly provided shelter to its members.\n\nCultists of the Shattered Peak viewed adventurers by their actions.  Opening Netherese tombs and unearthing magic was a good way to draw their ire.  Conversely, a group in pursuit of those who would do so, or power-abusing mages in general, would have found an ally in the cult.",
