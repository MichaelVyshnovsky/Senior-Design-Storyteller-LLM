The Disciples of the White Rod were a monastic order of the faith of Loviatar. All monks of the faith were members of the order. They were based out of an abbey near Calimport.
They were named after a token bestowed on the orders founder by the goddess herself. It was kept as a holy relic at their abbey.
Members of this monastic order preferred to inflict pain upon their enemies through use of their bare hands. One of the few weapons they were known to use, but only if forced to, were nunchaku with hilts wrapped in white-bleached leather.
