The '''Disciples of the White Rod''' were a monastic order of the faith of [[Loviatar]]. All [[monk]]s of the faith were members of the order. They were based out of an abbey near [[Calimport]].

They were named after a token bestowed on the order's founder by the goddess herself. It was kept as a holy relic at their abbey.<ref>

==Tactics==
Members of this monastic order preferred to inflict pain upon their enemies through use of their bare hands. One of the few weapons they were known to use, but only if forced to, were [[nunchaku]] with hilts wrapped in white-bleached leather.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|7}}
