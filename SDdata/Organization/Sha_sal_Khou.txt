The Shasal Khou was a secret organization of renegade githyanki and githzerai whose objective was the reunification of the gith race.
Although the Shasal Khou did not have a centralized leadership, its highest-ranking member was the githyanki warlord Zetchrr.
This belligerent stance worried other members of the Shasal Khou, but Zetchrr remained a strong advocate of their cause and a powerful force to attract new members.
The Shasal Khou had among its goals the cessation of the hostilities between the githyanki and the githzerai. By amassing new members, they hoped to establish an army that could secure a fortified enclave where they could call each other simply "gith". In the long term, the organization aimed for the creation of a nation inhabited by unified gith.
Members of the Shasal Khou operated undercover within both gith societies, attempting to defuse the tension between them and discouraging attacks against one another. At the same time, they were always looking to recruit gith who might share their point of view.
While the organization had secret strongholds in many locations of the Prime Material plane, one of their main bases was Zetchrrs own stronghold located in the city of Tunarath in the Astral Plane. It served as a shelter for its members and headquarters from which to plan their operations.
The organization also kept a secret base somewhere on the Sword Coast.
In the late 15th century DR, Urlon, the ruler of Stardock, attempted to make the asteroid into a stronghold for the Shasal Khou.
