The Cavaliers of the Ever-Changing Truth were an order of crusaders who worshiped Istishia, the Water Lord.
Members of this group guarded sites that were sacred to Istishia, escorted emissaries of the clergy, and harassed worshipers of Kossuth whenever they could. All members of the Cavaliers of the Ever-Changing Truth belonged to races that were natural air-breathers.
