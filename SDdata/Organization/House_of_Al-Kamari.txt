The House of Al-Kamari was one of the richest merchant families in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
They claimed to make the finest silks in all of Al-Toril.
The House of Al-Kamari owned the six largest storage buildings within the Warehouse District of Huzuz. In addition to this, they owned over a dozen factories within the Clothiers District that processed their silk.
Muizzi al-Kamar was the head of the Al-Kamari.
Mamluks from the Diligent Mamluk Society were employed to guard their wares.
This merchant family was based out of Huzuz, the City of Delights.
Silk and other expensive fabrics were the focus of the House of Al-Kamari. The merchant house was able to instill pride in their workers, earning their careful attention to detail when handling the delicate silk. Much of their silk came from large mulberry orchards located south of Huzuz. Silk moths fed on the mulberry until their cocoons were harvested. The Al-Kamari conducted experiments to see if spider silk would be another viable option.
Al-Kamari employed over 1,000 people in Huzuz, most of whom were women. They never hired anyone who had rough or calloused hands, fearing that a worker with rough hands would snag their silk.
Because of their corruption by the yikaria, which was unknown to the entirety of Huzuz, Al-Kamari were the unintentional enemies of the Grand Caliph.
