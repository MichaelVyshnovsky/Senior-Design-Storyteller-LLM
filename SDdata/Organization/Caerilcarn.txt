The '''Caerilcarn''' (meaning the '''Council of the Wood''') was a loose association of [[elf]] leaders in the [[High Forest]] that sought to rebuild the lost empire of [[Eaerlann]].

==Organization==
It was led by a [[wood elf]] named [[Morgwais]].

==Activities==
While it never claimed to represent the beliefs of all [[elves]] in the High Forest and the [[Silver Marches]], its end goal was to revive the lost elven realm of Eaerlann. In practice, it provided a forum for elven leaders in the High Forest to discuss issues of mutual concern and pass along news. It worked to revive Eaerlanni settlements and protect those that still existed.

==History==
It was formed sometime before [[1374 DR]].

When [[orc]]s and [[daemonfey]] began to invade in [[1374 DR]], it was instrumental in evacuating [[wood elf]] villages in the path of the invaders, leading them to the [[Lost Peaks]]. There, with assistance from the [[Argent Legion]], they were able to repel the attacks. At this point, the army of [[Evermeet]] began to occupy [[Glaurachyndaar|Myth Glaurach]], putting them that much closer to their dream of a revived Eaerlann.

==Cities==
* [[Teuveamanthaar]], in the form of [[Tall Trees]], resettled sometime at or before [[1358 DR]]
* [[Reitheillaethor]], newly settled sometime before [[1374 DR]]
* [[Nordahaeril]], newly settled sometime before [[1374 DR]]

==Members==
* [[Morgwais]], leader
* [[Yrind Morninglight]], leader/spokesperson of the faction that believes the existing clans and villages of wood and moon elves should be formally bound into a refounded Eaerlann.
