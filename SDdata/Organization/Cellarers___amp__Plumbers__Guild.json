        "mainbody": "The Cellarers and Plumbers Guild was a guild in Waterdeep that dug building foundations and maintained Waterdeeps sewer system.\nThe Old Guildhall was located on Gaustus Street in the Trades Ward.\nThe guild was employed to dig foundations and maintain the citys sewer system. They kept the sewers well-maintained. They used secret recipes to perform their maintenance duties and ordered their materials from others rather than making them themselves. Although they didnt always do so, the Cellarers and Plumbers had to call the Loyal Order of Street Laborers to fill in any holes that they had dug.\nFrequently, the guild would dig up valuables and corpses during their excavations. They were required to inform the owner of the property beneath which the objects were found but commonly, they did not bother to do so unless being directly observed by said owner. Rumors were rife that the guild created nonfunctional pipelines in the sewers in which they could hide these things.\nMembers of the Carpenters, Roofers, and Plasterers Guild were seen as \"thick-fingered clods\" by the Cellarers and Plumbers but they reserved the majority of their derision for the Loyal Order of Street Laborers, whose formation took profitable work away from the Cellarers and Plumbers.\nIn 1356 DR, Orlar Sarluk published a book titled Down the Drain A Life in the Guild of Cellarers and Plumbers.\nDuring the Time of Troubles, a large group of Cellarers were lost in the citys sewers. Unbeknownst to all, they had been transformed into cursts.\nIn 1367 DR, many Cellarers, including the guildmaster, began to be enslaved by the Savants of the Dark Tide. The Cellarers were the only organized group within the sewers, and the aboleths of the Dark Tide wanted to keep them under their control so that their presence in the sewers wouldnt be detected.\nIn 1479 DR, Laraelra Harsard, daughter of the guildmaster, hired Meloon Wardragon to investigate a problem (namely a collapsed wall) for the guild. That event led Laraelra and Meloon to discovering that Vajra Safahr, the Blackstaffs Heir, was being tortured in a cellar. The two and their allies eventually rescued Vajra.\nThere were no halfling members in 1479 DR. Despite their superior skill working with rock, there were also relatively few dwarven members of the guild as a result of discrimination by the other races in the guild.\nMembers had to pay five gold pieces to join and guild dues of seven silver pieces per month. In exchange, they were paid two gold pieces per job per day, all of their materials were also paid for and teams were given a ten-gold-piece stipend for food and drink per day, making them the best-paying service guild in the city.\nThe uniform of a Cellarer and Plumber was a deep orange cap and cloak with a red border. They typically wore leather armor and remained armed, to deal with the dangers of the sewers.\nIn 1374 DR, the guildmaster had been Master Plumber Hilithiimm Turnstone for many years and he planned to turn leadership over to his son Jhalossan when he retired. As of 1479 DR, the guild was headed by Malaerigo Harsard, the father of the Blackstaffs Heir Laraelra Harsard."
