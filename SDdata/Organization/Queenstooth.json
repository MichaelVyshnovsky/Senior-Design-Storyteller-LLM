        "mainbody": "In the late 15{{th}} century DR, a new threat emerged when [[meenlock]]s began invading from the [[Feywild]], having taken advantage of the weakening of the barrier between the [[planes]] owing to Vorazidrar's [[magic]]. Led by [[Spittleburn]], the kobolds fiercely fought back the invasion of meenlocks, but sought to seize and control&mdash;rather than destroy&mdash;the Feywild gates through which they emerged. Soon the conflict spiraled further out of control as the bloodshed awoke the Fen's dormant [[holdfast vine]]s.\n\nNot long after, [[adventurer]]s from [[Waterdeep]] arrived to investigate Forestfall Fen, and despite the Queenstooth kobolds' best efforts, they fought their way to the Queen and trapped her inside her lair. Although this broke her hold over Throden, it did not stop her continued desire for tribute from her minions, and soon she sought to rally the Queenstooth kobolds for war.",
        "Activities": "The kobolds' main duties were to provide \"gifts\" to their Queen and to wage war on other inhabitants of Forestfall Fen. They patrolled the outer areas of the swamp and fiercely defended the center of the Fen&mdash;where [[Throden]] village and Vorazidrar's lair were located&mdash;from all potential invaders.",
        "Tactics": "{{fq\n| text   = More green for the Queen\n| source = Queenstooth taunt\n| float  = \n| width  = \n| styles = \n}}In combat, the Queenstooth kobolds wielded scimitars and javelins, and would mercilessly taunt their enemies. They were adept at using the dangerous terrain of Forestfall Fen as both a layer of defense and a weapon in their arsenal.",
        "Base of Operations": "They operated out of a hidden [[lizardfolk]] village near Vorazidrar's lair known as Throden.",
        "Relationships": "The Queenstooth kobolds lived alongside the lizardfolk of Throden to their mutual benefit. They unfailingly served their Queen, Vorazidrar, as her \"teeth\", which she herself never used in battle.\n\nThey were mortal enemies of any who would threaten their village or queen, notable the [[Muckgrunter]] [[troll]]s and the many monsters that resided in Forestfall Fen.",
        "History": "The Queenstooth kobolds arrived in Forestfall Fen alongside their Queen sometime before the 15{{th}} century DR. Discovering that they needed the aid of strong allies to survive the Fen, they joined with the lizardfolk of Thorden and helped to build up the village into a settlement for both groups.\n\n{{fq\n| text   = The Queen's Teeth are many!

        "Members": "Queenstooth kobolds had black-scales and spoke the [[Draconic language]]. It was thought that they were cousins of the red-scaled kobolds who were members of the [[Burntbone Horde]].\n\nTheir leader in the late 15{{th}} century DR was Spittleburn, who of course was simply a servant of Queen Vorazidrar."
