        "Organization": {
            "Factions": "The Red Wizards have historically been fraught with in-fighting and turmoil. As the stakes rose over the years, these conflicts became more dramatic and impactful to their operations.\n\nIn the years before the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Red Wizards divided themselves into two separate ideological groups. The influential Imperialists sought to conquer Faerûn, by military might, subterfuge, or any other means necessary.\n\nAfter Szass Tam seized power from the Council of Zulkirs, the Red Wizards underwent a more severe divide. Both the zulkirs and the Red Wizards loyal to their respective schools were forced to choose a faction in the growing conflict: either remain with those loyal to their Thayan way of life but remain outside Thay, or side with Szass Tam and his ever-expanding cabal of liches, [[vampire]]s, and other undead spellcasters.\n\nWhen the war ended, Szass Tam emerged victorious. He reshaped Thay into the domain of the undeath in Faerûn, and supplanted the fractured Council of Zulkirs with those loyalist undead wizards who had embraced his \"way of life\", as it were. The Red Wizards outside of Thay, either having fled or been exiled, eschewed many of their old traditions. They grew out their hair, forewent getting [[tattoo]]s, and enjoyed lives as merchants, even passing on their title as \"Red Wizard\" through marriage, heredity, and even adoption. However, there emerged another faction of exiled Red Wizards, known as the [[Thayan Resurrection]]. They sought to restore their nation to its former glory by moving against Szass Tam and his undead scourge at every opportunity."

        "Activities": "[[File:Wizards_of_Thay.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Red Wizards always had a flair for the dramatic and the dreadful.]]\nFor most of their history, the Red Wizards enjoyed their status as the aristocratic ruling class of Thay. Led by the Imperialists, they used their authority and arcane power to spearhead numerous battles of conquest against their neighboring nations. The Red Wizard regularly assaulted both the wild lands of [[Rashemen]] to the north, and the nation of [[Aglarond]] to the west.\n\nDuring the mid–14{{th}} century the Red Wizards spent much of their efforts spreading their influence via their [[Thayan enclave|trade enclaves]]. They used these havens to act as spies and concealed against for the nation of Thay. \n\nWhen traveling across the realms, Red Wizards were always well protected. They were often accompanied either by the fearsome [[Thayan gladiator|gladiators]] of Thay, [[cleric]]s of [[Kossuth]], or even [[Thayan knight]]s, who dedicated their lives to the role as their protectors. They were hardly discreet in their journeys, often carrying themselves with boorish swagger or haughty detachment.\n\nIn the years following the [[Second Sundering]], the Thayan Red Wizards were once again relegated to serving as agents of the [[zulkir]]s or even Regent Szass Tam himself. They were often directed to travel the Realms to acquire powerful [[magic]]al items in order for the zulkirs to further consolidate their power.",
        "Training": "Thayan children were tested for the [[Magic|Art]] at an early age within the walls of the [[Arcane College]] in [[Eltabbar]]. Red Wizard youth received tutoring from older, aging, oftentimes embittered, and disabled Red Wizards. The training was done throughout the nation and overseen by the [[Probity Corps]] of Thay. In cases where the trainer was believed to be disloyal or in any way suspicious, their wards were sent to the Arcane College for re-training. Most Red Wizards, however, only see the Arcane College once in their lives as they were being tested.{{Cite web/theedverse/2023-01-24 - Young Red Wizards' Training}}",

They even experimented with inscribing these tattoos on slaves, who they could then use to infiltrate other city-states.",
        "Tactics": "When conflict arose, Red Wizards gave decisive orders to the soldiers, knights, or other allied forces under their command. They worked especially closely with Thayan knights in order to coordinate defensive and offensive shifts in combat. Red Wizards were well-trained in the arts of war, but still readily listened to those trusted individuals who offered tactical advice.\n\nDuring battle, Red Wizards acted aggressively. They often utilized large-area-of-effect spells to incapacitate or harm a large number of their forces. They regularly employed the various ''[[scroll|spell scrolls]]'' and ''[[wand]]'' to which they had such ready access.",
        "Base of Operations": "[[Image:4e red wizards.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''Red Wizards of [[Rose Keep]], circa [[1479 DR]].'']]\n\nFrom the mid–14{{th}} century onwards, the Red Wizards maintained [[Thayan enclave|enclaves]] in many major cities all across Faerûn. While each one was considered an autonomous entity, each of them had the shared goal of greater accumulation of wealth. Prior to the [[War of the Zulkirs|Thayan civil war]], the Red Wizards could act with complete impunity within their enclaves, as they were considered to be set upon Thayan soil and only subject to Thayan law.\n\nThere were sizable Thayan enclaves in the cities of [[Thayan enclave (Athkatla)|Athkatla]], Baldur's Gate, Calaunt, Calimport, Chavyondat, Cimbar, [[Thayan enclave (Hillsfar)|Hillsfar]], Hlath, Hlondeth, Innarlith, Iriaebor, Marsember, Messemprar, [[Thayan enclave (Mulmaster)|Mulmaster]], [[Thayan Quarter|Procampur]], [[Thayan enclave (Proskur)|Proskur]],  Ravens Bluff, Saerloon, [[Thayan enclave (Scardale)|Scardale]], Scornubel, [[Enclave of Red Magic|Skullport]], Soorenar, Telflamm, [[Rose Keep|Veltalar]],\n\nOnly the tradition of separated autonomy survived the war. Those Red Wizards who lived as merchants throughout Faerûn no longer received the support of their home nation of Thay.",
        "Possessions": "The most distinctive feature of the Red Wizards was their namesake red robes. In fact, they were the only individuals allowed to wear red garments, save for the nation's [[priest]]s of [[Kossuth]]. Those who dared to break this rule were put to death.\n\nMany of the wizards preferred to wield [[whip]]s as their weapons of choice.",
        "Relationships": "While the Red Wizards held supreme authority in their homeland of Thay, they were not well trusted and in fact reviled across the Realms.\n\nThey constantly schemed to bring down their neighboring nations of [[Rashemen]], where they were thwarted by the equally famed magicians the [[Witches of Rashemen]]; [[Aglarond]], where they were turned back by [[the Simbul]] of the [[Seven Sisters]]; and [[Mulhorand]], from where the people of Thay first emigrated.\n\nDuring the height of their influence, the Red Wizards were the enemies of many forces in [[Toril]]. Amongst those who opposed them were the Witches of Rashemen, the Seven Sisters and their allies, the goodly [[Harpers]], and even the [[Zhentarim]], who disliked the Wizards encroaching on their territory. The [[Fangshields]] fought against the Red Wizards due to their horrific experimentation and creation of black unicorns.\n\nAlthough the Red Wizards' allies were few, they often proved to be powerful assets. The [[church of Kossuth]] in Thay provided much aid throughout the years, and [[monk]]s from the [[Order of the Long Death]] were often called upon to carry out assassinations. \n\nThe Red Wizards often drew agreements with and received great support from [[fire genasi]] and [[fiend]]ish beings, such as [[tiefling]]s, [[demons]], and [[devils]]. They utilized savage [[gnoll]] warriors among their legions of soldiers.\n\nUtilizing dark spells and horrific arcane experimentation, the Red Wizards created new species of beasts to be designated as their servants. Among their twisted creations were: [[Black unicorn]]s, twisted versions of the [[unicorn|magical steed]]; [[chosen one]]s, monstrous-looking humanoids; [[dread warrior]]s, fearsome undead champions that were unequaled on the battlefield; and [[Neo-orog]]s, a sub-species of the monstrous orc–[[ogre]] hybrid.",
        "History": {
            "Formative Years": "[[Image:Red Wizard - Clyde Caldwell.jpg|right|thumb|240px|''A red wizard on the cover of Dreams of the Red Wizards.'']]\n\nThe Red Wizards were once a secret cabal of 10{{th}} century [[Mulhorand]]i spellcasters, known as the '''Red Wizards of Mulhorand''', who sought nothing more than to  achieve sovereignty away from their overmasters. \n\nThey won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Thazalhar]] in the {{YearlinkName|922}}. The wizards delved into the [[demoncyst]] beneath [[Thaymount]] and used dark rituals to elicit the aid of the fearsome [[demon lord]] [[Eltab]]. The Red Wizards were then able to overwhelm the city of [[Delhumide]], defeat the [[Mulhorand]]i [[god-king]], and gain independence for the province of Thay.\n\nThe Red Wizards led Thay's first attempted annexation of Rashemen in the {{YearlinkName|934}}, but their advances were repulsed.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|955}}, the Red Wizards managed to [[magic]]ally transport an entire horde of [[orc]]s from the [[Spine of the World]] mountains to the lands south of Thay. Their role in the [[Orcgates Affair]], as it came to be known, was taken to diminish the prestige of the [[Covenant]] alliance of mages.\n\nThe Red Wizards led an assault on the Covenant's arcane school in [[Neverwinter]] during the {{YearlinkName|1081}}, leading to the death of [[Aganazzar]] and a \"wizardwar\" between the two groups. This conflict would continue until the {{YearlinkName|1101}} with the dissolution of the Covenant.",
            "Years of Conquest": "They launched their first failed invasion of Aglarond in the {{YearlinkName|1194}}. However they would repel an Aglarondar invasion at the [[Battle of Lapendrar]] in the {{YearlinkName|1260}}.\n\nWhen the [[elves]] of [[Cormanthor]] began to [[Retreat|leave]] their forest in the {{YearlinkName|1344}}, the Red Wizards set their sights on the ruins of [[Myth Drannor]]. They gradually and discreetly established an enclave in [[Scardale Town]] within the [[Dalelands]] in order to gain access to the ruined elven city.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, two members of the Council of Zulkirs forged an alliance with two of Kossuth's lesser rivals, [[Fyzzar]] the [[salamander]] lord, [[Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan]], Sultan of the [[Efreeti]], in order to conquer the [[Lapendrar|coastal cities]] near Thay. The zulkirs were taken advantage of by their allies, and permanent ''[[gate]]'' to the [[Elemental Plane of Fire]] was established. The creatures of flame and fire would not return to their home plane and devastated the region of [[Priador]]. It was only when Zulkir [[Aznar Thrul]] was able to strike a deal with Firelord Kossuth, that the conflict known as the [[Salamander War]] came to an end.\n\nAfter another failed attempt at securing Rashemen in the same year, the Red Wizards planned to infiltrate the nations of Faerûn legitimately. They founded Thayan enclaves in cities across Faerûn, in which they publicly sold magic items, and discreetly trafficked in drugs, wicked spells, and slaves. Using these enclaves, they hoped to infiltrate foreign politics. They would themselves powerful and indispensable to these foreigners, ensuring future global domination.\n\nThe Council of Zulkirs and Red Wizard organization as a whole began to experience internal strife in the {{YearlinkName|1362}}. The Zulkir of [[alteration]] [[Maligor]] attempted to seize power from the rest of the council. His efforts were thwarted by a surprising alliance between Szass Tam and agents of the Harpers.\n\nDuring a Thayan invasion of Rashemen, in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, the Red Wizards melted glaciers atop the [[Icerim Mountains]]. The sudden waves of ice water flooded the cities of [[Immilmar]] and [[Mulsantir]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1367}}, Red Wizards made an enemy of the since-imprisoned Eltab. The then-zulkir of [[necromancy]] Szass Tam attempted to enslave the demon lord to ''[[Thakorsil's Seat]]'' by means of the ''[[ritual of twin burnings]]'', but was thwarted by some [[adventurer]]s. Eltab swore revenge against the necromancer and the rest of his Red Wizards.\n\nBy the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the Red Wizards found they had much greater success accumulating power through financial wealth rather than military might. Because of this, they ceased direct hostilities against neighboring nations for a short time.",
            "Civil War": "Less that a decade later, in the {{YearlinkName|1375}}, Szass Tam plunged Thay into a [[War of the Zulkirs|civil war]] when he began a coup against his fellow zulkirs. The Red Wizards were divided into two separate factions and fought each other in a war that lasted ten years. To defeat his foes, Tam harnessed the devastation of the [[Spellplague]] to gain god-like powers and ravage the landscape of Thay.{{Cite dragon/366/Rose Keep|41}}\n\nThe rebel zulkirs and their followers were driven from Thay as exiles. The Red Wizards' dark plots came back to haunt them and many of their enemies used the group's turmoil to assault the many enclaves.\n\nFor the Red Wizards, however, the death of the zulkirs ended what the Red Wizards once had been and gave way for the new order. They suffered a great divide that would last for nearly a century. The spellcasters in Thay who declared their loyalty to Szass Tam continued to act as magocratic overseers. Those that fled Thay or chose not to return to their homeland, were forced to live new sorts of lives. \n\nThose Red Wizards who continued to serve Szass Tam and his undead zulkirs in Thay continued to enjoy their prestige and privilege as magocratic rulers.\n\nA great blow came to the Thayan Red Wizards, in the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, as the exiled Zulkirs interrupted Szass Tam's grand scheme to become a being of godlike power. The Zulkirs rallied what allies they had and prevented the completion of Tam's ultimate end, the ''[[ritual of the unmaking]]''. Their efforts cost them their lives but likely saved Faerûn from one of the greatest threats it might have ever faced and prevented Szass Tam from ever attempting the ritual on Thayan soil.",
            "Red Wizards Divided": "[[File:Renegade Red Wizards.jpg|thumb|right|200px||One of the renegade Red Wizards of the [[Thayan Resurrection]]]]\nThe exiled Red Wizards were stripped of their power and prestige, living as traders{{Cite dragon/366/Rose Keep|41}} Outside of Thay, the words \"Red Wizards\" came to only be thought of as the quintessential merchant arcanists. The exile mages transformed their old enclaves into their new homes. What had once been a facade of a purpose, the accumulation of profit through selling magical items, became daily practice as the Red Wizards eked out new lives outside of Thay.{{Cite dragon/366/Rose Keep|42}}\n\nAt some point during the 15{{th}} century, the Thayan Resurrection sect of Red Wizards emerged in Thay. The group openly resisted Szass Tam and his undead servitors, \n\nAround the {{YearlinkName|1485}}, Red Wizards of Bloodgate Keep traveled the [[Sword Coast]] to gain access to four powerful elemental ''[[portal]]s'' that were previously established created by a [[Netherese]] cult dedicated to the four [[Elemental Princes of Evil]].\n\nShortly thereafter, a group of Thayan Red Wizards, led by the lich [[Tarul Var]] of [[Bloodgate Keep]], aligned themselves with the [[pit fiend]] [[Baazka]]. They plotted to take over the nodes of Elemental Evil to create a portal that would allow Thayan soldiers to march on the Sword Coast. [[Valindra Shadowmantle]] led other Thayan loyalists to the [[Heart of Ubtao]] in [[Chult]], in order to secure or even destroy the device known as the ''[[Soulmonger]]''.\n\nAlso around this time, yet another group of Red Wizards accompanied a band of [[githyanki]] knights to seek out some enormous [[adamantine]] item from within a dungeon beneath the Dragon Caves of [[Tu'narath]]. It was unknown if they were members of Szass Tam's loyalists, the Thayan Resurrection, or yet some other faction."
