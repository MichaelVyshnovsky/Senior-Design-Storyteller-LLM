        "mainbody": "The Red Wizards of Thay, colloquially known as the Red Magic Cult in the Eastern Heartlands, were the notorious and nefarious magocratic ruling class of the inhospitable but well-inhabited country of Thay. Historically they owed their power to being cruel slavers, demonologists, and arcane experimenters, before most of their numbers wholly dedicated themselves to creating a nation of undead.\nFor centuries, the leaders of the Red Wizards and in fact all of Thay was the Council of Zulkirs. The ruling body comprised eight of the most powerful Red Wizards, each of whom represented one of the schools of magic.\nIn the years following the War of the Zulkirs, the Red Wizards of Thay were led by the feared lich and supreme regent, Szass Tam.\nSince Szass Tams takeover, the exiled Red Wizards have transformed enormously, becoming a loosely organized chain of merchant enclaves who specialized in procuring magical items.\nThe Red Wizards have historically been fraught with in-fighting and turmoil. As the stakes rose over the years, these conflicts became more dramatic and impactful to their operations.\nIn the years before the mid–14 century DR, the Red Wizards divided themselves into two separate ideological groups. The influential Imperialists sought to conquer Faerûn, by military might, subterfuge, or any other means necessary.\nAfter Szass Tam seized power from the Council of Zulkirs, the Red Wizards underwent a more severe divide. Both the zulkirs and the Red Wizards loyal to their respective schools were forced to choose a faction in the growing conflict either remain with those loyal to their Thayan way of life but remain outside Thay, or side with Szass Tam and his ever-expanding cabal of liches, vampires, and other undead spellcasters.\nWhen the war ended, Szass Tam emerged victorious. He reshaped Thay into the domain of the undeath in Faerûn, and supplanted the fractured Council of Zulkirs with those loyalist undead wizards who had embraced his \"way of life\", as it were. The Red Wizards outside of Thay, either having fled or been exiled, eschewed many of their old traditions. They grew out their hair, forewent getting tattoos, and enjoyed lives as merchants, even passing on their title as \"Red Wizard\" through marriage, heredity, and even adoption. However, there emerged another faction of exiled Red Wizards, known as the Thayan Resurrection. They sought to restore their nation to its former glory by moving against Szass Tam and his undead scourge at every opportunity.\nthumb|right|300px|The Red Wizards always had a flair for the dramatic and the dreadful.\nFor most of their history, the Red Wizards enjoyed their status as the aristocratic ruling class of Thay. Led by the Imperialists, they used their authority and arcane power to spearhead numerous battles of conquest against their neighboring nations. The Red Wizard regularly assaulted both the wild lands of Rashemen to the north, and the nation of Aglarond to the west.\nDuring the mid–14 century the Red Wizards spent much of their efforts spreading their influence via their trade enclaves. They used these havens to act as spies and concealed against for the nation of Thay. \nWhen traveling across the realms, Red Wizards were always well protected. They were often accompanied either by the fearsome gladiators of Thay, clerics of Kossuth, or even Thayan knights, who dedicated their lives to the role as their protectors. They were hardly discreet in their journeys, often carrying themselves with boorish swagger or haughty detachment.\nIn the years following the Second Sundering, the Thayan Red Wizards were once again relegated to serving as agents of the zulkirs or even Regent Szass Tam himself. They were often directed to travel the Realms to acquire powerful magical items in order for the zulkirs to further consolidate their power.\nThayan children were tested for the Art at an early age within the walls of the Arcane College in Eltabbar. Red Wizard youth received tutoring from older, aging, oftentimes embittered, and disabled Red Wizards. The training was done throughout the nation and overseen by the Probity Corps of Thay. In cases where the trainer was believed to be disloyal or in any way suspicious, their wards were sent to the Arcane College for re-training. Most Red Wizards, however, only see the Arcane College once in their lives as they were being tested.\nEach Red Wizard was expected to wholly dedicate themself to a single school of magic. and cast exceptionally potent spells from their preferred school,\nDue to their unique arrangement of mercantile enterprise, Red Wizards had access to the finest magical items and seldom saw the need to attend magefairs.\nThey carefully transformed their homeland of Thay to their liking using powerful weather-controlling spells, and set up magical barriers that barred unwanted travelers from entrance.\nThe Red Wizards were known practitioners of circle magic. This form of magic allowed several spellcasters to combine their arcane power in order to bolster the prowess of their \"circle leader\", or maximize the efficacy of the leaders spells. They were also among the numerous groups to have independently uncovered information about contingent spells.\nSome of the spells most readily associated with Red Wizards included animate dread warrior, circle, combust, flame dagger, flensing, Nybors gentle reminder, and spell-lash.\nJust as tattoos were a featured aspect of Mulani culture, so was tattoo magic for the Red Wizards. They even experimented with inscribing these tattoos on slaves, who they could then use to infiltrate other city-states.\nWhen conflict arose, Red Wizards gave decisive orders to the soldiers, knights, or other allied forces under their command. They worked especially closely with Thayan knights in order to coordinate defensive and offensive shifts in combat. Red Wizards were well-trained in the arts of war, but still readily listened to those trusted individuals who offered tactical advice.\nDuring battle, Red Wizards acted aggressively. They often utilized large-area-of-effect spells to incapacitate or harm a large number of their forces. They regularly employed the various spell scrolls and wand to which they had such ready access.\nright|thumb|300px|Red Wizards of Rose Keep, circa 1479 DR.\nFrom the mid–14 century onwards, the Red Wizards maintained enclaves in many major cities all across Faerûn. While each one was considered an autonomous entity, each of them had the shared goal of greater accumulation of wealth. Prior to the Thayan civil war, the Red Wizards could act with complete impunity within their enclaves, as they were considered to be set upon Thayan soil and only subject to Thayan law.\nThere were sizable Thayan enclaves in the cities of Athkatla, Baldurs Gate, Calaunt, Calimport, Chavyondat, Cimbar, Hillsfar, Hlath, Hlondeth, Innarlith, Iriaebor, Marsember, Messemprar, Mulmaster, Procampur, Proskur,  Ravens Bluff, Saerloon, Scardale, Scornubel, Skullport, Soorenar, Telflamm, Veltalar,\nOnly the tradition of separated autonomy survived the war. Those Red Wizards who lived as merchants throughout Faerûn no longer received the support of their home nation of Thay.\nThe most distinctive feature of the Red Wizards was their namesake red robes. In fact, they were the only individuals allowed to wear red garments, save for the nations priests of Kossuth. Those who dared to break this rule were put to death.\nMany of the wizards preferred to wield whips as their weapons of choice.\nWhile the Red Wizards held supreme authority in their homeland of Thay, they were not well trusted and in fact reviled across the Realms.\nThey constantly schemed to bring down their neighboring nations of Rashemen, where they were thwarted by the equally famed magicians the Witches of Rashemen Aglarond, where they were turned back by the Simbul of the Seven Sisters and Mulhorand, from where the people of Thay first emigrated.\nDuring the height of their influence, the Red Wizards were the enemies of many forces in Toril. Amongst those who opposed them were the Witches of Rashemen, the Seven Sisters and their allies, the goodly Harpers, and even the Zhentarim, who disliked the Wizards encroaching on their territory. The Fangshields fought against the Red Wizards due to their horrific experimentation and creation of black unicorns.\nAlthough the Red Wizards allies were few, they often proved to be powerful assets. The church of Kossuth in Thay provided much aid throughout the years, and monks from the Order of the Long Death were often called upon to carry out assassinations. \nThe Red Wizards often drew agreements with and received great support from fire genasi and fiendish beings, such as tieflings, demons, and devils. They utilized savage gnoll warriors among their legions of soldiers.\nUtilizing dark spells and horrific arcane experimentation, the Red Wizards created new species of beasts to be designated as their servants. Among their twisted creations were Black unicorns, twisted versions of the magical steed chosen ones, monstrous-looking humanoids dread warriors, fearsome undead champions that were unequaled on the battlefield and Neo-orogs, a sub-species of the monstrous orc–ogre hybrid. \nright|thumb|240px|A red wizard on the cover of Dreams of the Red Wizards.\nThe Red Wizards were once a secret cabal of 10 century Mulhorandi spellcasters, known as the Red Wizards of Mulhorand, who sought nothing more than to  achieve sovereignty away from their overmasters. \nThey won a decisive victory at the Battle of Thazalhar in the . The wizards delved into the demoncyst beneath Thaymount and used dark rituals to elicit the aid of the fearsome demon lord Eltab. The Red Wizards were then able to overwhelm the city of Delhumide, defeat the Mulhorandi god-king, and gain independence for the province of Thay.\nThe Red Wizards led Thays first attempted annexation of Rashemen in the , but their advances were repulsed.\nIn the , the Red Wizards managed to magically transport an entire horde of orcs from the Spine of the World mountains to the lands south of Thay. Their role in the Orcgates Affair, as it came to be known, was taken to diminish the prestige of the Covenant alliance of mages.\nThe Red Wizards led an assault on the Covenants arcane school in Neverwinter during the , leading to the death of Aganazzar and a \"wizardwar\" between the two groups. This conflict would continue until the  with the dissolution of the Covenant.\nThey launched their first failed invasion of Aglarond in the . However they would repel an Aglarondar invasion at the Battle of Lapendrar in the .\nWhen the elves of Cormanthor began to leave their forest in the , the Red Wizards set their sights on the ruins of Myth Drannor. They gradually and discreetly established an enclave in Scardale Town within the Dalelands in order to gain access to the ruined elven city.\nIn the , two members of the Council of Zulkirs forged an alliance with two of Kossuths lesser rivals, Fyzzar the salamander lord, Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan, Sultan of the Efreeti, in order to conquer the coastal cities near Thay. The zulkirs were taken advantage of by their allies, and permanent gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire was established. The creatures of flame and fire would not return to their home plane and devastated the region of Priador. It was only when Zulkir Aznar Thrul was able to strike a deal with Firelord Kossuth, that the conflict known as the Salamander War came to an end.\nAfter another failed attempt at securing Rashemen in the same year, the Red Wizards planned to infiltrate the nations of Faerûn legitimately. They founded Thayan enclaves in cities across Faerûn, in which they publicly sold magic items, and discreetly trafficked in drugs, wicked spells, and slaves. Using these enclaves, they hoped to infiltrate foreign politics. They would themselves powerful and indispensable to these foreigners, ensuring future global domination.\nThe Council of Zulkirs and Red Wizard organization as a whole began to experience internal strife in the . The Zulkir of alteration Maligor attempted to seize power from the rest of the council. His efforts were thwarted by a surprising alliance between Szass Tam and agents of the Harpers.\nDuring a Thayan invasion of Rashemen, in the , the Red Wizards melted glaciers atop the Icerim Mountains. The sudden waves of ice water flooded the cities of Immilmar and Mulsantir.\nIn the , Red Wizards made an enemy of the since-imprisoned Eltab. The then-zulkir of necromancy Szass Tam attempted to enslave the demon lord to Thakorsils Seat by means of the ritual of twin burnings, but was thwarted by some adventurers. Eltab swore revenge against the necromancer and the rest of his Red Wizards.\nBy the , the Red Wizards found they had much greater success accumulating power through financial wealth rather than military might. Because of this, they ceased direct hostilities against neighboring nations for a short time.\nLess that a decade later, in the , Szass Tam plunged Thay into a civil war when he began a coup against his fellow zulkirs. The Red Wizards were divided into two separate factions and fought each other in a war that lasted ten years. To defeat his foes, Tam harnessed the devastation of the Spellplague to gain god-like powers and ravage the landscape of Thay.\nThe rebel zulkirs and their followers were driven from Thay as exiles. The Red Wizards dark plots came back to haunt them and many of their enemies used the groups turmoil to assault the many enclaves.\nFor the Red Wizards, however, the death of the zulkirs ended what the Red Wizards once had been and gave way for the new order. They suffered a great divide that would last for nearly a century. The spellcasters in Thay who declared their loyalty to Szass Tam continued to act as magocratic overseers. Those that fled Thay or chose not to return to their homeland, were forced to live new sorts of lives. \nThose Red Wizards who continued to serve Szass Tam and his undead zulkirs in Thay continued to enjoy their prestige and privilege as magocratic rulers.\nA great blow came to the Thayan Red Wizards, in the , as the exiled Zulkirs interrupted Szass Tams grand scheme to become a being of godlike power. The Zulkirs rallied what allies they had and prevented the completion of Tams ultimate end, the ritual of the unmaking. Their efforts cost them their lives but likely saved Faerûn from one of the greatest threats it might have ever faced and prevented Szass Tam from ever attempting the ritual on Thayan soil.\nthumb|right|200px||One of the renegade Red Wizards of the Thayan Resurrection\nThe exiled Red Wizards were stripped of their power and prestige, living as traders Outside of Thay, the words \"Red Wizards\" came to only be thought of as the quintessential merchant arcanists. The exile mages transformed their old enclaves into their new homes. What had once been a facade of a purpose, the accumulation of profit through selling magical items, became daily practice as the Red Wizards eked out new lives outside of Thay.\nAt some point during the 15 century, the Thayan Resurrection sect of Red Wizards emerged in Thay. The group openly resisted Szass Tam and his undead servitors, \nAround the , Red Wizards of Bloodgate Keep traveled the Sword Coast to gain access to four powerful elemental portals that were previously established created by a Netherese cult dedicated to the four Elemental Princes of Evil.\nShortly thereafter, a group of Thayan Red Wizards, led by the lich Tarul Var of Bloodgate Keep, aligned themselves with the pit fiend Baazka. They plotted to take over the nodes of Elemental Evil to create a portal that would allow Thayan soldiers to march on the Sword Coast. Valindra Shadowmantle led other Thayan loyalists to the Heart of Ubtao in Chult, in order to secure or even destroy the device known as the Soulmonger.\nAlso around this time, yet another group of Red Wizards accompanied a band of githyanki knights to seek out some enormous adamantine item from within a dungeon beneath the Dragon Caves of Tunarath. It was unknown if they were members of Szass Tams loyalists, the Thayan Resurrection, or yet some other faction.\nThe Red Wizards of Thay were highly selective about to whom they granted admittance. They nearly only took in members of the Mulan ethnic group. Very few Rashemi were allowed to join their ranks, and only then if they disguised themselves as Mulan.\nAs their name suggested the Red Wizards admitted wizards over other arcane spellcasters, such as sorcerers or bards. Even then, only about one of every six wizards in Thay was a member of the Red Wizards.\n* Maligor The notorious zulkir of alteration once famously, and foolishly, challenged the authority and might of Szass Tam. \n* Rath Modar One of the exiled members of the Thayan Resurrection, Rath sought to summon forth the dragon deity Tiamat.\n* Szass Tam After serving as the zulkir of necromancy for centuries as a lich, Szass Tam elevated himself to Regent of all of Thay.\n* Zhengyi The Witch-King of Vaasa was once a mortal Red Wizard."
