        "mainbody": "The '''Mispurr''' clan was a member of the [[Onsruur]]&mdash;the council of lords with twenty seats, one for each elite family&mdash; in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]].{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|87}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 66: Khôltar, Part 17, More on the Onsruur}}",
        "Organization": "This bloodline did not have any distinguishing features that allowed them to be easily identifiable, but their manner of dress, taste in furnishings, and attitude made them stand out. The Mispurr were showmen, carrying their indulgences to excess. They were dancers and singers that favored high-fashion clothes and expensive, opulent furnishings. In their eyes, they were educated and \"preferred of the gods\", but to the other Onsruur they were privately considered haughty, self-aggrandizing buffoons.",
        "Activities": "The Mispurr supported many [[bard]]s with their patronage."
