        "mainbody": "he Mispurr clan was a member of the Onsruur&mdashthe council of lords with twenty seats, one for each elite family&mdash in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.\nThis bloodline did not have any distinguishing features that allowed them to be easily identifiable, but their manner of dress, taste in furnishings, and attitude made them stand out. The Mispurr were showmen, carrying their indulgences to excess. They were dancers and singers that favored high-fashion clothes and expensive, opulent furnishings. In their eyes, they were educated and \"preferred of the gods\", but to the other Onsruur they were privately considered haughty, self-aggrandizing buffoons.\nThe Mispurr supported many bards with their patronage."
