        "mainbody": "The '''Horthander''' family had a seat in the [[Onsruur]] (council of lords) of [[Khôltar]] in [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. It was one of twenty such [[human]] families that held the reins controlling the Iron City.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|68-69}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 54: Khôltar, Part 5, The Farrgaunlar}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|86-87}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 65: Khôltar, Part 16, A Brief History of Khôltar, Part 3}}",
        "Organization": "This clan was typically tall and pleasingly handsome or beautiful. They developed a passion for race [[horse]]s and spent much of their time breeding and racing them. By 1372 DR, most of the expansive enclosed gardens of the family estate had been converted to stables for their prized animals.",
        "Activities": "The Horthanders had many business interests in Khôltar. Their flagship enterprise was the Horthander casting foundry, but they also owned dozens of smaller businesses, mostly repair shops and companies that installed plumbing or did masonry, plastering, or painting. They were heavily invested in land throughout [[Shaareach]] and [[Lapaliiya]].",
        "Base of Operations": "The family demesne was a boldly styled klathlaaedin (sculpted stone mansion) named [[Anthormbrur]] located at the southeastern end of [[Hael Way]] very near Farrgaunlar (the southern gate through the walls of Khôltar).",
        "Relationships": "This family had a strong dislike for their next-door neighbors, the [[Khaundrove]]s, as the result of a longstanding rivalry that existed for decades, perhaps centuries."
