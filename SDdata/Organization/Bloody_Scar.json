        "mainbody": "The Bloody Scar were an orcish tribe that inhabited the Greypeak Mountains and the northern reaches of the Fallen Lands in the 14 century DR.\nLike most orc tribes in the Fallen Lands, the Bloody Scar occasionally rode upon axebeaks. While doing so, they typically wielded lances or shortbows.\nThe other orcish tribes that inhabited the Graypeak Mountains and northern Fallen Lands, ruled by petty and constantly feuding kings, showed fealty to the Bloody Scar tribe and their leader. These included the Black Bone, Black Slasher, Seven Eye, and Severed Fist tribes.\nThis tribe was ruled by an orc known as Ogrash."
