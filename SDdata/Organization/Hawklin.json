However, they achieved noble status relatively late compared to most other noble families.\n\nIn the 1360s [[DR]], the then family head [[Barandos Hawklin]] was only the third generation of the family to be treated as nobility. Heading Crown-chartered [[adventuring companies]], he had distinguished himself on adventures in the [[Stonelands]] and [[Hullack Forest]]. He was a favorite at court thanks to his charm and wit.\n\nA century late, the Hawklins were a prominent family around [[1479 DR]].{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail}}",
        "Base of Operations": "The family was based in [[Suzail]] at [[Hawklin House]] and had holdings in [[Thunderstone]].",
        "Activities": "The family lacked estates and businesses that yielded an income, but rumors claimed the vaults of Hawklin House contained much wealth won or looted from adventuring as well as riches gained in rewards.",
