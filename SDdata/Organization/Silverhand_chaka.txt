The Silverhand chaka was a prominent chaka within the Shining Lands of southeast Faerûn during the mid-to-late 14 century DR and a member of the Chakas of 31.
The Silverhand chaka was based in the city of Ulara in northwest Estagund.
They were rare among the chakas of the region in that they were an organization of dwarves. Their wealth came from the silver mines within the nearby Thrulaliel Mountains.
