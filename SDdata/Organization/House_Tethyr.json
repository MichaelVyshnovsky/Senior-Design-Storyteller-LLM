        "History": "The House was made up of the extensive and long-ruling noble families of several successive related dynasties. [[Clan Ithal]] was followed by the [[Strohm Dynasty|five Strohms]], who were in turn followed by a series of beloved [[Bormul]] rulers known as the [[Queens' Dynasty]]. They were cut short by their presumptuous cousin claimants of the [[Lions' Dynasty]], who simplified the House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul down to the House of Tethyr. The House continued to rule Tethyr until the [[Ten Black Days of Eleint]] almost rendered them extinct, with Prince [[Haedrak III]] wedding Queen [[Zaranda Star]] of the new [[Rhindaun Dynasty]]."
