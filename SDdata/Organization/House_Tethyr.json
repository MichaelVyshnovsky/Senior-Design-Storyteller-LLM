        "mainbody": "House Tethyr, earlier known as the House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul, was a major noble family of Tethyr that served as monarchs through several dynasties.\nThe House was made up of the extensive and long-ruling noble families of several successive related dynasties. Clan Ithal was followed by the five Strohms, who were in turn followed by a series of beloved Bormul rulers known as the Queens Dynasty. They were cut short by their presumptuous cousin claimants of the Lions Dynasty, who simplified the House of Ithal-Strohm-Bormul down to the House of Tethyr. The House continued to rule Tethyr until the Ten Black Days of Eleint almost rendered them extinct, with Prince Haedrak III wedding Queen Zaranda Star of the new Rhindaun Dynasty."
