        "mainbody": "The '''Swords of Evereska''' was a militia formed of noble-born [[elven]] warriors and [[mage]]s of [[Evereska]]. It symbolized that no elf, not matter how high born, was above serving in defense of the elven LastHome.",
        "Organization": "The Swords were led by the Blademajor (or Blade-Major), a title that rotated among its more politically minded members periodically.\n\nIt was composed of two separate groups, the Noble Blades and Lordly Wands. The Blades were martial warriors that were led in battle by the Blademajor, while the Wands included [[spellcaster]]s that were directed by the group's Artmaster.",
        "Activities": "The Swords served in defense of Evereska however was needed, whether fighting of threats to the elven stronghold",
        "History": "On [[Nightal 30]] in the {{YearlinkName|1371}}, Aubric Nihmedu and [[Rhydwych Bourmay]] led the Swords on a perilous mission during the early battles between Evereska and the [[phaerimm]], which recently escaped from beyond the [[Sharn Wall]]. They ventured through the phaerimm-controlled region of the [[Shaeradim]] to [[Rocnest]], where they encountered a group of [[Elven high mage|high mages]]. The elven mages were collectively forming a great ''[[portal]]'' that would allow the relief army of [[Waterdeep]] to bypass the [[Deadwall]] barrier created by the phaerimm and bolster Evereska's defenses. The Swords were successful in part. They bought the high mages just enough time until the [[chosen]] of [[Mystra (Midnight)|Mystra]] [[Khelben Arunsun]] could destroy many of the phaerimm and rout their thralls. Unfortunately, Blademajor Nihmedu did not survive.",
        "Members": "Elves from among the most well-regarded Evereskan families served as the city's Swords. They were at least 100 strong in number ''circa'' [[1371 DR]]."
