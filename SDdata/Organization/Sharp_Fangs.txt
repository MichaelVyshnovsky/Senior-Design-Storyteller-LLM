The Sharp Fangs were a tribe of goblins that inhabited the Orsraun Mountains in the midâ€“14 century DR.
Their members typically wielded short swords and rode upon the backs of worgs.
In 1358 DR, the Sharp Fangs were allied with the Muktaran empire and fought for them in their Turmish war at the Battle of Wilna Pass.
