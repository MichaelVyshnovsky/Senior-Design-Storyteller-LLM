The '''Naskurl''' family was a noble merchant family of the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]]. The head of the family sat on the [[High Council]] that governed Tantras.

In [[1358 DR]], shortly after the [[Time of Troubles]], the Naskurls were allied with the [[Baraedin]], [[Mithertul]], and [[Onsil]] families.
