The '''Red Fangs''' were the smallest of the three [[orc]] tribes that dwelled within the [[Rauvin Mountains]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The tribe earned its name from the ritual sacrifice they made to [[Gruumsh]]. They lashed their foes to altars and feasted upon them while they were still alive.
==Base of Operations==
They dwelled within the western peaks of the Rauvin Mountains.

==Relationships==
The Red Fangs considered the [[Heart Takers]] tribe to be their rivals and held deep-seated fear of the [[Tornskulls]].

==History==
Around the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, 400 orcs from the tribe left their ancestral home and ventured west to find new lands to pillage. They were not heard from by their fellow Red Fangs since their departure.
