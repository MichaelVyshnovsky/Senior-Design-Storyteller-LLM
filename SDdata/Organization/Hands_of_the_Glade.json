        "mainbody": "he Hands of the Glade were an organization of psionic healers and carers operating in Turmish, based out of the city of Gildenglade, and active around 1374 DR.\nThey were of various races mostly elves, half-elves, and dwarves, with some humans and others. However, they were all psionically gifted and of shared purpose.\nAll of them sought to achieve the skills of a sangehirn, or had already done so. Psionics was not normally regarded as a healing art, but this unique discipline was dedicated to healing others, by using mental powers to renew mind and body.\nWandering Turmish, the Hands of the Glade provided succor and healing to weary and hurt travelers and adventurers."
