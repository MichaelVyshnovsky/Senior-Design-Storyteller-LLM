The '''Circle of Leth''' was one of the most powerful druidic hierarchies of [[Faer√ªn]]. They were the followers of the [[Nentyarch]], and governed both the [[Forest of Lethyr]] and much of the surrounding lands in the [[Great Dale]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|83}}

==Organization==
The Circle of Leth was made up of three rings. Five high [[druid]]s made up the first ring, standing just below the [[Nentyarch]]; they were the Nentyarch's advisors and the mentors to all below them. Nine druid masters made up the second ring, which searched out threats to the territory in their ward, commanding the [[Nentyar hunter]]s in times of war. The third ring was made up of the Circle's initiates, low-ranking druids and novices serving amongst the Nentyar hunters or apprenticing to members of the first two rings.

==Activities==
The Circle of Leth protected the woods and lands under their care from wanton cutting and oversettlement,{{cite book/Unapproachable East|126-127}} People from [[Thesk]] knew better than to enter the [[Forest of Lethyr]], considering it to be under the protection of the Circle of Leth.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|171}}

Following the fall of [[Narfell]], the Circle of Leth took up the task of healing [[Dun-Tharos]] and the [[Rawlinswood]]. After the [[Rotting Man]] took control at Dun-Tharos, the Circle of Leth stopped fighting against the loggers from [[Damara]] and [[Impiltur]] in the Rawlinswood.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|118}} In the {{yearlinkName|1372}}, the Circle of Leth was working with local [[treant]]s around [[Fortress Narder]] to resettle healthy trees and then wipe clean the blighted land around the fortress. They also guarded the [[Mucklestones]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|117}}

Additionally, the Circle of Leth was the most important of the informal powers in the Great Dale, acting as its only unifying force in times of war, and preventing them from being at each other's throats in times of peace.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|120}} In this position, they were central to fighting off the Rotting Man's forces.{{cite book/Unapproachable East}}

==Base of Operations==
The Nentyarch ruled from his seat at [[Dun-Tharos]] until {{yearlink|1371}}, when the Rotting Man successfully displaced them, forcing the circle to relocate to the [[Forest of Lethyr]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|115}}{{cite book/Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide|134-135}}

==Possessions==
The druids of Leth were the only ones guarding the secret of the power of the stone markers at [[Bezentil]].{{cite book/Unapproachable East|124}}

==Relationships==
The Circle of Leth had often clashed with the king of [[Damara]] over logging rights. [[Nentyar hunter]]s carried out the commands of the Circle.{{Cite dragon/394/Born Under a Violent Moon|65}}

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|722}}, the Great Druid of Leth took up the title of Nentyarch, and raised a new druidic castle, [[The Close]], atop the overgrown ruins at Dun-Tharos.{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|100}}

In the {{yearlinkName|1362}}, the Rotting Man came to the Rawlinswood for the first time. In the {{yearlinkName|1364}}, servants of the [[Shadowmasters]] attempted to frame the rangers of the Forest of Lethyr for killing Lord [[Uthrain]]; they were stopped by a band of adventurers. In {{yearlink|1368}}, a plague spread through the land, driving treants insane. The Rotting Man's army took Dun-Tharos on {{yearlink|1371}}, expelling the Nentyarch, who regrouped in Yeshelmaar.{{cite book/Unapproachable East|122}}{{cite book/The Grand History of the Realms|151}}
