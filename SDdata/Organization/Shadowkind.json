In exchange, he desired the deaths of a few of his enemies in Procampur, including the high priest of Torm. The Shadowkind accepted on the condition of proof of the poisons magic immunity. Calispar accepted and organized a demonstration in the nearby hamlet of Sevenecho. A representative of the Shadowkind, Autton Shadowshroud, was sent to oversee the test. \nThe Shadowkind were a small but elite guild of assassins.\nIt was customary for members to dye their hair black.\nCategoryAssassins guilds\nCategoryOrganizations\nCategoryOrganizations in Procampur\nCategoryOrganizations in the Vast\nCategoryOrganizations in North Faerûn\nCategoryOrganizations in Faerûn\nCategoryCriminal organizations\nan5s134bl5sqn1epcpyysjs9j6oqkfa"
