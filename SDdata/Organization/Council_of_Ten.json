        "mainbody": "The Council of Ten was the ruling body of government in Phlan.\nEach member of the council was a judge able to exercise full judicial powers. The head of the council was referred to as Number One and acted as mayor for Phlan. The citizens of Phlan called for votes of \"no confidence\" for slight setbacks, ill omens, or perhaps when a dashing hero rode into town. Thus, elections for new councilmen was commonplace.\nIn 1367 DR the council dealt secretly with druids, against the wishes of the general public, to restore the poisoned gardens of Valjevo Castle to their natural state."
