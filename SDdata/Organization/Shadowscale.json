        "mainbody": "The '''Shadowscale''' tribe was a tribe of [[undead]] [[shadowslain]] [[lizardfolk]] dwelling in the [[Vast Swamp]] of [[Cormyr]] and in the [[Shadow Swamp]] in the [[Plane of Shadow]].",
        "History": "[[File:Tearing of the Weave cover art.jpg|thumb|500px|right|Adventurers battling Shadowscale lizardfolk and will-o'-wisps in the Vast Swamp.]]\nThe Shadowscale tribe emerged from the enslaved remnants of the [[Dragonslayer (tribe)|Dragonslayer]] tribe, when the [[black dragon]] [[Despayr]] used the power of the ''[[shadow shard]]'' to transform them into undead, shadowslain creatures, including his own half-breed daughter, their chieftain [[Ketsarra Shadowscale]].\n\nIn the service of [[Esvele Graycastle]]'s scheme, Despayr sought to dominate much of the Vast Swamp. Their goal was to tear a hole in the [[Weave]] of [[magic]] and so form a [[dead-magic zone]] over all the Vast Swamp. It was to be a powerbase for the followers of [[Shar]]. In the [[1374|Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR]], at Despayr's behest, the Shadowscales made savage war upon the tribes of the Vast Swamp, particularly the other lizardfolk, who could hardly resist the shadowslain raiders. Many were slain and more were captured and carried off to the Lost Refuge, eventually returning as Shadowscales themselves to attack their own kin.\n\nIn response, the [[Sharptooth]], [[Blackscale]], and [[Poison Dusk]] lizardfolk tribes formed an alliance under [[Kessessek]]. In early [[Eleint]], Kessessek led a war party of Sharptooths, Blackscales, and Poison Dusks into Shadowscale territory around the Skull Staff. They hoped to slay some Shadowscales or their [[Shar]]-worshiping allies, or else capture some of the \"dream walkers\"—mind-controlled petitioners of a false [[Temple of Mystra (Wheloon)|Temple of Mystra]]—that regularly passed that way to the Lost Refuge. Kessessek and his kin recognized that these dream walkers were innocents and hoped to capture them, free their minds, and deny this resource to their shared enemy. In fact, they found adventurers in service to [[Mystra]] investigating the false temple and Sharrans' activities. Parlaying at the [[Vast Swamp geyser|Sharptooth encampment]], Kessessek aided and enlisted the adventurers to deal with the Shadowscales at the Lost Refuge. The adventurers later  assaulted the Lost Refuge and defeated the Shadowscales there, including Ketsarra.\n\nAs they journeyed through the Shadow Swamp, the adventurers likely discovered the Shadowscale Warren and fought the main bulk of the tribe there. Warchief Kossaandar is presumed to have been destroyed in the fighting, after which any remaining Shadowscales scattered across the Shadow Swamp, no longer answering Despayr, and a tribe no more.",
        "Culture": "A Shadowscale was created when a captured lizardfolk was exposed to the [[necromancy|necromantic]] magic of the ''shadow shard'' and transformed into an undead shadowslain creature. Over time, all the original living lizardfolk of the tribe became shadowslain beings.\n\nThe Shadowscales were always of [[evil]] bent, but other orientations they'd possessed in life remained unchanged. Although shadowslain were not bound to serve the owner of the ''shadow shard'', the Shadowscales did so anyway.\n\nThe Shadowscales maintained the same habits they'd had as living lizardfolk, even if no longer necessary, but over time they abandoned these. For example, the Shadowscales would retire to their lairs to mimic eating and sleeping, though they had no need to. They kept tools for hunting and trapping, but gave up using them, and not feeling the cold or needing light to see, they no longer bothered to light fires. Most tragically were the disused egg chambers, where no more eggs were laid and no young hatched.\n\nWhile some still lived, the Shadowscales believed in having the spirits of deceased kin watch over their unhatched eggs, and so placed their dried skulls in their egg chambers. The tribe had had a shaman, who'd been killed rather than transformed into a shadowslain.",
        "Description": "Appearing as a regular lizardfolk of its kind, a Shadowscale was swathed in flickering, rippling shadows, and its eyes glowed with a light described as unholy and hate-filled.<ref group=\"note\">The shadowslain Shadowscales are not fully described, but artwork depicts Ketsarra as decayed while the cover art shows the Shadowscales as almost skeletal.",
        "Abilities": "As a shadowslain, a Shadowscale carried a potent aura that could drain Weave magic from an [[arcane]] spellcaster who stood too close for too long. As a spell was lost, the Shadowscale was healed of any damage, according to the power of the spell.\n\nThe semisolid [[shadowstuff]] that cloaked a Shadowscale served as a form of armor, helping to turn aside attacks. By bringing shadows with them, it also gave them great ability to hide.\n\nOtherwise, a Shadowscale had greater strength than a normal lizardfolk, the ability to see in darkness as with both [[low-light vision]] and [[darkvision]], and all the benefits and drawbacks of being an undead monster. Being creatures of shadow, they were dazzled in the bright light day.",
        "Possessions": "Typical Shadowscales carried [[javelin]]s or [[shortbow]]s, but otherwise wore no armor and fought with their claws. The veteran Shadowscale marauders wielded [[greatclub]]s and javelins, and the highest-ranked wore [[chain shirt]]s.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Shadowscales established their territory in the western Vast Swamp, around locations necessary to Sharran operations, including the [[Skull Staff]] However, their main territory was in the [[Shadow Swamp]], on the [[Plane of Shadow]], where they had a number of settlements and outposts, the largest and most important of which was the mound-fort known as the [[Shadowscale Warren]]. They also served as guards at the [[Shadow Citadel]].",
        "Notable Shadowslain": "* [[Ketsarra Shadowscale]], chieftain of the Shadowscales\n* [[Kossaandar]], warchief"
