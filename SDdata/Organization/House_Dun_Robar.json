        "mainbody": "House DunRobar was a notable Lolthite drow house of the city of Sschindylryn in the 15 century DR. Of the citys houses, they were most renowned for their martial prowess and power.\nDunRobar was famed in Sschindylryn for its martial focus. The house manufactured bespoke magical weapons that it sold to outsiders, as well as provided elite training for guards and soldiers throughout the city. Internally, DunRobar maintained a tradition of excellence in its warriors, with its estate more like a fortress than a home.\nThe estate of House DunRobar was located inside Sschindylryn proper, and was filled with well-armed house guards and traps. Much of its internal space was devoted to chambers for housing and training soldiers, as befitting their business.\nDuring the Darkening in the mid-1480s DR, DunRobar joined an alliance with House Szind, House Avithoul, and several smaller houses in the Sschindylryn invasion of Eveningstar, which was orchestrated by High Priestess Hekta Szind in an effort to find the Thread of the Weave on behalf of Lolth. Matron Jyr DunRobar devoted her houses resources to the war, sending many soldiers to assault Eveningstar and secure the surrounding Underdark.\nAs part of the Cormyrean counterattack, Wizard of War Traegar Vadamore sent a team of daring adventurers into the depths of the Underdark to find and sabotage House DunRobar. Cloaked with powerful illusions disgusing them as drow servants, the surfacers found Battlemaster Teblyn DunRobars personal weapon racks and contaminated them with a fast-acting rust monster ichor that destroyed the metal. They then moved to the estates courtyard and rang a bell in challenge (potentially encountering Matron Jyr along the way), causing the Battlemaster to arrive in a furious state and attack them without his favored weapons. With DunRobar sabotaged and their Battlemaster defeated by a group of mysterious drow in a public manner, the house was sent into an uproar even as their reputation for martial excellence suffered. Their suspicions of outside interference caused them to draw away from their Szind and Avithoul allies, greatly weakening the drow war effort. Just as Traegar Vadamore planned, this opened up a weakness in the drow defenses that allowed a later attack upon the Sschindylryn Ziggurat and the Temple of Lolth atop it.\nDuring the invasion of Eveningstar in the late 15 century DR, the house included the following notable drow\n* Atrezt DunRobar, Master Scout.\n* Draya DunRobar, Field Commander.\n* Gilcori DunRobar, Priestess.\n* Jyr DunRobar, Matron.\n* Soldiirn DunRobar, Blademaster.\n* Speitar DunRobar, Blademaster.\n* Teblyn DunRobar, High Battlemaster.\n* Xyra DunRobar, Priestess."
