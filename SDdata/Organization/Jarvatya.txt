The Jarvatya were a family of jinyan (yakuza in other lands) based in the capital city of Ranguri in the Kuong Kingdom.
In the mid–14 century DR, the Jarvatya were the most powerful such family in the kingdom. Like other jinyan, they supported the temples of the Lords of Creation, at least when it suited them.
Kalivan, the corrupt priest of the temple in Srelanat, was related to the Jarvatya.
