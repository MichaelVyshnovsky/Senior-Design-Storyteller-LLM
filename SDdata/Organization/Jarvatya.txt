The '''Jarvatya''' were a family of [[Kuong_Kingdom#Society|jinyan]] ([[yakuza]] in other lands) based in the capital city of [[Ranguri]] in the [[Kuong Kingdom]].

In the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Jarvatya were the most powerful such family in the kingdom. Like other jinyan, they supported the temples of the [[Lords of Creation]], at least when it suited them.

[[Kalivan]], the corrupt priest of the temple in [[Srelanat]], was related to the Jarvatya.
