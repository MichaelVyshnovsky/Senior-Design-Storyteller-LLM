Rayburton was a noble house of Cormyr.
The crest of the Rayburton family was a black "hawkdragon". It had the feathered head and beak of a hawk but the rest of the body, including scales, a forked tongue, large claws, and a reptilian tail, was very reminiscent of a dragon. The renowned explorer and historian Volothamp Geddarm posited that this symbol was the result of an inebriated Rayburton laying eyes on a wyvern.
