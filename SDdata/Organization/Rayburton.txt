'''Rayburton''' was a noble house of [[Cormyr]].{{Cite dragon/278/The New Adventures of Volo: Lost Treasures of Cormyr|88}}

==Organization==
The crest of the Rayburton family was a black "hawkdragon". It had the feathered head and beak of a [[hawk]] but the rest of the body, including scales, a forked tongue, large claws, and a reptilian tail, was very reminiscent of a [[dragon]]. The renowned explorer and historian [[Volothamp Geddarm]] posited that this symbol was the result of an inebriated Rayburton laying eyes on a [[wyvern]].
