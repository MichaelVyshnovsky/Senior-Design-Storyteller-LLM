        "mainbody": "The Masters of the Yuirwood were a collective of highly skilled elves who dedicated themselves to the preservation and protection of the Yuirwood forest.\nThese foresters worked to cease any encroachment upon the Yuirwood, regardless of its source. They spent their days maintaining vigil over the forest and investigating or dealing with any interlopers.\nMasters of the Yuirwood were nigh-undetectable while moving through the forest. They enjoyed a strong connection with the animals of the forest and were readily able to communicate with them.\nThey utilized a portal network that comprised numerous menhir circles located throughout the Yuirwood. With these menhir circles, they alone were able to rapidly move across the woods in order to respond to any growing threats. Beyond the forest, they could even travel to the elven realm of Sildëyuir.\nMore experienced masters were able to use the portals to travel to forests in other areas of Faerûn, or even another menhir circle located on another world.\nThe maintained their headquarters in the forest town of Relkaths Foot.\nOn most occasions, the Masters of the Yuirwood maintained a strong loyalty to whomever ruled the nation of Aglarond. They were particularly fond and protective of the Simbul, whose aims often included the preservation of the Yuirwood.\nThroughout their history the group was able to reclaim some territory of the Aglarondan Peninsula that was previously lost.\nMany of the renowned rangers of Relkaths Foot were also counted among the Masters of the Yuirwood.\n* Dervila Greenwood"
