        "mainbody": "The Nine Wei clans were a collection of nine Shou clans who effectively controlled all of Shou political life on the Dragon Coast as of the late 15 century DR. \"Wei\" roughly translated to \"power\".\nThe Nine Wei included the clans who ruled over the Shou nation of Nathlan, but they also projected their power over the various Shou-towns throughout the Dragon Coast. Through their sponsorship of the Nine Golden Swords, they wielded further influence within the city of Westgate.\nIndividual members of the Nine Wei clans jockeyed against each other for power and influence in the Dragon Coast, and to curry favor with the Neng clan, the clan that led the Nine. The Neng clan was a \"consort\" clan of Shou Lung, and thus had strong ties to the Shou imperial court. Their leadership was said to be divine, and the clan set a highly lawful and traditionalist tone for the Nine Wei clans.\nThe Wei clans rose to power in the 15 century DR, although the roots of their influence stretched back centuries to the original arrival of the Neng clan in Nathlekh.\nIn the , a supposed heir to one of the Nine Wei clans conspired to destroy the Fan clan, another prominent Wei member. Under the pseudonym Madfox, he established a criminal syndicate known as the White Petal Tong in order to frustrate efforts to form a trade alliance between the Fan and the Neng clans.\nKnown clans among the Nine Wei included\n* The Fan clan, a Wei clan with close ties to the Nine Golden Swords as of the late 15 century DR. \n* The Neng clan, the most influential of the Wei clans owing to their connections to imperial Shou Lung, and thus the leader among the Nine. The head of the clan was said to be a \"walking god\"."
