        "mainbody": "The '''Nine Wei clans''' were a collection of nine [[Shou]] clans who effectively controlled all of Shou political life on the [[Dragon Coast]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. \"Wei\" roughly translated to \"power\".{{Cite organized play/LFR/Falling Snow, White Petal|31}}",
        "Activities": "The Nine Wei included the clans who ruled over the Shou nation of [[Nathlan]], but they also projected their power over the various [[Shou-town]]s throughout the Dragon Coast. Through their sponsorship of the [[Nine Golden Swords]], they wielded further influence within the city of [[Westgate]].\n\nIndividual members of the Nine Wei clans jockeyed against each other for power and influence in the Dragon Coast, and to curry favor with the [[Neng clan]], the clan that led the Nine. The Neng clan was a \"consort\" clan of [[Shou Lung]], and thus had strong ties to the Shou imperial court. Their leadership was said to be [[divine]], and the clan set a highly lawful and traditionalist tone for the Nine Wei clans.",
        "History": "The Wei clans rose to power in the 15{{th}} century DR, although the roots of their influence stretched back centuries to the original arrival of the Neng clan in [[Nathlekh]].\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1479}}, a supposed heir to one of the Nine Wei clans conspired to destroy the [[Fan clan]], another prominent Wei member. Under the pseudonym [[Madfox]], he established a criminal syndicate known as the [[White Petal Tong]] in order to frustrate efforts to form a trade alliance between the Fan and the Neng clans.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Night of Fallen Petals|37}}",
        "Members": "Known clans among the Nine Wei included:\n* The [[Fan clan]], a Wei clan with close ties to the Nine Golden Swords as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Falling Snow, White Petal|4}} \n* The [[Neng clan]], the most influential of the Wei clans owing to their connections to imperial [[Shou Lung]], and thus the leader among the Nine. The head of the clan was said to be a \"walking [[god]]\"."
