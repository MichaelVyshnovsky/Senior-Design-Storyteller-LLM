'''Shaele's Shields''' was a prosperous mercenary company from [[Murghôm]], led by [[Shaele Flamehair]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
Shaele's Shields, like all other mercenary companies of Murghôm was established by the country's military veterans who were forced into this line of work by the army reduction by decrees of the [[Princes of Murghôm]]. All companies, Shaele's Shields included, were not bigger than 40 ex-military members in the full employment of the organization.

The company's insignia was the image of three orange [[shield]]s, arranged in a horizontal line. The middle shield overlapped with its neighbors.

==History==
By the late 15{{th}}century DR, under the command of the notorious mercenary leader Shaele Flamehair and her bold actions, Shaele's Shields became the most expensive and busiest company of Murghôm.
