Shaeles Shields was a prosperous mercenary company from Murgh么m, led by Shaele Flamehair in the late 15 century DR.
Shaeles Shields, like all other mercenary companies of Murgh么m was established by the countrys military veterans who were forced into this line of work by the army reduction by decrees of the Princes of Murgh么m. All companies, Shaeles Shields included, were not bigger than 40 ex-military members in the full employment of the organization.
The companys insignia was the image of three orange shields, arranged in a horizontal line. The middle shield overlapped with its neighbors.
By the late 15century DR, under the command of the notorious mercenary leader Shaele Flamehair and her bold actions, Shaeles Shields became the most expensive and busiest company of Murgh么m.
