The '''Diyantu''' family was an important family in the city of [[Tu Pe]] in [[Koryo]] around [[1357 DR]]. The Diyantu Family House stood in the floating city that lay in the harbor, on its eastern edge.

It was among those families who were so influential and powerful in the floating city that their patriarchs were practically kings in their domains.
