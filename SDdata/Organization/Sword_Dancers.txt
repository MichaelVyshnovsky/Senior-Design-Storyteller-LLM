The Sword Dancers were a faction within the Everlasting in 1367 DR.
The Sword Dancers were based in the fortress of Sarahin located deep within the Haunted Lands.
This young faction held beliefs that often clashed with the views of other holy slayer groups.
They used fiery cleansing rituals, fasting, and ecstatic ritual dancing to strengthen their powers.
The Court of Rhythm served as the origin of the Sword Dancers.
The Unclean viewed the Sword Dancers as allies and the perfect complement to their sorcerous might.
The Sword Dancers were led by an efreeti named Farouk Abd al-Bazan. There were 43 members as of 1367 DR.
