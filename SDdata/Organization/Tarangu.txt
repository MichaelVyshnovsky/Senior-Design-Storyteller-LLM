The '''Tarangu''' was a tribe of [[halfling]]s who inhabited an area of [[Jazayir al-Sartan]] in [[southwest Zakhara]]. 

==Organization==
The Tarangu did not build permanent structures on the ground. Instead they lived in special nests constructed in [[palm|palm trees]]. [[Rope]]s hung between nests so the halflings could get around without touching the ground.

==Activities==
These war-like halfings were rumored to be cannibalistic. Slavers often targeted the halflings since they did not follow the path of [[Enlightenment]].

==Base of Operations==
The Tarangu tribe inhabited the northern chain of [[Jazayir al-Alfar]].

==Possessions==
These people were semi-nomadic and only carried what they needed to travel between the islands.

==Members==
The Tarangu were ruled by a halfling named [[Indeema]], who was an obese matron. She was a priest of [[Kar'r'rga]] and supervised all sacrifices made to the savage god.
