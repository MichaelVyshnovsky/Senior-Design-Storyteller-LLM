House '''Blacktree''' was a noble family that lived in the city of [[Ravens Bluff]] during the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were highly respected among the city's [[Nobility of Ravens Bluff|nobility]] and commoners alike, and remained quite wealthy, despite some previous poorly chosen and somewhat shady investments.

Their family motto was: "outroar the lion".

==History==
During [[War of Ravens Bluff|the war]], Lord Blacktree contributed his complement of 250 "gardeners" and his 20-strong cadre of personal guards, known as the [[Black Knights]], to the raising of the Ravenian army.

Following the conflict, Lord Blacktree brought a great deal of acclaim and renown to the noble house. He was praised by his fellow nobility and granted knighthood in the [[Knights of the Lady|Order of the Lady]]. In the mayoral election that followed the war, Lord Blacktree campaigned for the post, with full support of the Ravenian army. Despite this, he couldn't quite raise enough [[gold]] as [[Amber Lynn Thoden|Lady Amber Lynn Thoden]], and she won the post.

The Blacktree family further solidified their power base in Ravens Bluff, as well as their ties with [[Moorland|House Moorland]], one of the founding families of the city, following the marriage of Lord Charles Blacktree IV to [[Katherine Marie Moorland|Lady Katherine Moorland]],
