Clan Arkeld was a dragonheir clan of the Sword Lands of Laerakond.
Clan Arkeld was one of the oldest clans of Laerakond. Its members were descendants of the first human roostmasters of the primordials, who lived millennia before the Spellplague.
In the late years of the 15th century DR clan Arkeld was a diminished clan, in decline and with only a few surviving individuals, scattered throughout the Sword Lands.
