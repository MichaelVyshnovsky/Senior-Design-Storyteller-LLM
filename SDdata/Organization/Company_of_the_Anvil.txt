The '''Company of the Anvil''' were a one-time adventuring company around [[Tethyr]] in [[1370 DR]].

==Organization==
The Company of the Anvil was composed by [[Bramas Thorntree]], gathering old allies specifically in order to recover the ''[[Sondarr Scepter]]''.

==Members==
Four of the group's eight members were:
* Bramas Thorntree, the leader;
* [[Merap]] the "Dead-eyed";
* [[Phulir]]; and
* [[Maera]].

==History==
The Company of the Anvil was gathered in 1370 by Bramas under the orders of his employer [[Kiros Tamadan]], a spice merchant in [[Athkatla]], who through various agents and blind contacts worked for [[Inselm Hhune]]. The Company managed to recover the ''scepter'' from a long-forgotten [[dwarven]] tomb in the [[Starspire Mountains]]. They were ordered to maintain a low profile on their return journey, and on [[Uktar 10]], they stopped in to the [[Blue Badger Inn]] in the village of [[Toralth]] for drink.

Later that night, three [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Bapar Ghalmrin]], [[Odak Truesteel]], and [[Soram Battlebellow]], entered the tavern seeking the ''Sondarr Scepter''. However, the dwarves accidentally engaged in a brawl with the [[Shields of the Highland]] adventuring company. Bramas and his companions used this as an opportunity to escape with the ''scepter'', but the dwarves eventually caught up with them and recovered it.
