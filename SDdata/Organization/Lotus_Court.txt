The '''Lotus Court''' was the ruling body of government for the [[Yikarian Empire]] in [[1367 DR]].{{AQ-time}}{{Cite dragon/241/Campaign Classics: The Roof of the World}}

==History==
The Lotus Court was formed of nobles from among the population of [[yak-folk]] inhabiting the [[World Pillar Mountains]] in the [[Land of the Yak-Men]]. The most powerful group within the Lotus Court, and therefore the closest to the [[Lotus Emperor|emperor's]] ear, were the [[Lords of the Nine Heavens]].

==Activities==
Though the Lotus Emperor had the final say in anything regarding the Empire, the Lotus Court offered him council and advice on a multitude of issues.
