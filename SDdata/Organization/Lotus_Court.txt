The Lotus Court was the ruling body of government for the Yikarian Empire in 1367 DR.
The Lotus Court was formed of nobles from among the population of yak-folk inhabiting the World Pillar Mountains in the Land of the Yak-Men. The most powerful group within the Lotus Court, and therefore the closest to the emperors ear, were the Lords of the Nine Heavens.
Though the Lotus Emperor had the final say in anything regarding the Empire, the Lotus Court offered him council and advice on a multitude of issues.
