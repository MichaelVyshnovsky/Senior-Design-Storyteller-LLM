They were ruined both financially and reputationally when their enemies stole their masterworks and tools.

She worked with groups as varied as the Zhentarim and the Open Lord of Waterdeep to accomplish this singular goal.\nBy the late 15 century DR, Naomlen had reclaimed enough pieces of her familys masterworks to use them to forge a pair of enchanted kukris known as the kukris of cunning, which she wielded in continued pursuit of her goal.\n* Naomlen Girdaur, a rogue and Zhentarim assassin who sought to reclaim the familys lost works.\n* Naomlens great-grandmother, who was said to have crafted the elusive ring prior to the familys initial fame."
