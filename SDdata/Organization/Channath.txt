The '''Channath''' family was a noble merchant family of the city of [[Tantras]] in [[the Vast]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The head of the family sat on the [[High Council]] that governed Tantras.

In [[1358 DR]], shortly after the [[Time of Troubles]], the Channaths were allied with the [[Elovear]], [[Laranadda]], [[Tithlin]], and [[Vandover]] families.
