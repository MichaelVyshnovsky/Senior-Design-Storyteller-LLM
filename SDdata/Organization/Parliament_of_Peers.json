        "mainbody": "The '''Parliament of Peers''' was an advisory council that held governance over the city of [[Baldur's Gate]] during the latter half of the 15{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were responsible for submitting official recommendations, regarding a myriad of civil issues, to the Dukes of the [[Council of Four]]. In addition, they were entrusted to elect new Dukes to the council that held the utmost authority within the city.\n\n{{quote|''The Flaming Fist can be bought, the Harpers are scattered, and the Parliament of Peers... well, they're just generally too inbred to be useful.''|[[Nine-Fingers Keene]]}}",
        "Activities": "Parliament held their meetings in [[High Hall]], using several smaller chambers and a grand, 300-seat hall for when the entire body was in attendance. Most of their sessions were open to observers, however on occasion they were forced to hold session behind closed doors.\n\nThey held official assemblies every day in the afternoon, though attendance was not mandatory. Typically, between twenty to thirty members were in attendance unless the topic at hand was one of particular importance. Meetings covered a wide range of issues,\n\nA great number of parliament members had been bought, or were at least influenced by [[the Guild]] and its leader [[Nine-Fingers]].",
        "History": "The legislative body was formed shortly after the attempted coup of [[Valarken|Duke Valarken]] during the mid–15{{th}} century [[DR]]. The city's [[patriar]] urged the last remaining councilor, [[Portyr|Duke Portyr]], to form a congress of trusted citizens who decided exactly who would be elected to fill the vacant positions within the Council of Four. After electing the extremely popular [[Abdel Adrian|Grand Duke Abdel Adrian]], parliament was allowed to keep their legislative and elective powers.",
