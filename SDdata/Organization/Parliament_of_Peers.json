        "mainbody": "century DR\nThe Parliament of Peers was an advisory council that held governance over the city of Baldurs Gate during the latter half of the 15 century DR. They were responsible for submitting official recommendations, regarding a myriad of civil issues, to the Dukes of the Council of Four. In addition, they were entrusted to elect new Dukes to the council that held the utmost authority within the city.\nParliament held their meetings in High Hall, using several smaller chambers and a grand, 300-seat hall for when the entire body was in attendance. Most of their sessions were open to observers, however on occasion they were forced to hold session behind closed doors.\nThey held official assemblies every day in the afternoon, though attendance was not mandatory. Typically, between twenty to thirty members were in attendance unless the topic at hand was one of particular importance. Meetings covered a wide range of issues,\nA great number of parliament members had been bought, or were at least influenced by the Guild and its leader Nine-Fingers.\nThe legislative body was formed shortly after the attempted coup of Duke Valarken during the midâ€“15 century DR. The citys patriar urged the last remaining councilor, Duke Portyr, to form a congress of trusted citizens who decided exactly who would be elected to fill the vacant positions within the Council of Four. After electing the extremely popular Grand Duke Abdel Adrian, parliament was allowed to keep their legislative and elective powers.\nAround fifty trusted Baldurian citizens made up the Parliament of Peers, who met daily, albeit seldom in full number, to discuss the citys future and recommend actions for the dukes on matters both great and small. Approximately twelve members typically hailed from the Lower City, constituting roughly one-quarter of the Parliament, with the remaining members coming from the noble families of the Upper City, known as patriars. Membership was predominantly hereditary, especially among the Baldurian patriar. The Parliament consisted of various influential figures, including retired adventurers and guild leaders. \nNew seats were created by parliament under their own power and this was always done by unanimous consent. \nNotable Members\n*Alia Durinbold, a wood elven member of the Durinbold family.\n*Coran, a former adventurer.\n*Eshvelt Guthmere, a member of the Guthmere family.\n*Petric Amber, a wood elven patriar.\n*Randolf Vammas, a businessman and member of the Vammas family.\n*Reavus Moore, a wealthy merchant.\n*Rugger Shattershield, a member of the Shattershield patriar family.\n*Ruth Linnacker, an aging matriarch of the Linnacker family.\n*Imbralym Skoond, the charming Athkatlan wizard.\n*Winstra Hullhollyn, a socialite from the Hullhollyn family."
