        "mainbody": "Due to their particular field of study, monks of the Long Death were both resistant to and capable of wielding deathly effects and magic. The imprint that death left on their soul made them appear exceptionally frightful to others. easily slaying weakened individuals, and even killing others with their mere touch.\nWhen fighting against humanoid opponents, monks of the Long Death preferred to use their bare hands. When forced to fight some beast or monstrous creature, their weapon of choice was the kama.\nThere were at least three known monasteries of the Long Death. One in the eastern realm of Thay, one in the Firesteap Mountains on the eastern edge of the Lake of Steam, and the Abbot of the High Crypt within the Turnstone Hills in the Silver Marches.\nThe order even established a small, secret school in the area of Scardale.\nWithin their monasteries, monks of the Long Death often kept shelves full of rare alchemical reagents and numerous specimens of dead animals and plant life.\nThe monks dressed in a manner that reflected their fascination with death, wearing dark hooded robes that hid their faces.\nWhile they were generally distrustful of others, the order were civil with those who sought to share any insights about death. Due to their narrow scope of interest they were seldom considered to be interesting or engaging by others. They did maintain a form of relationships with the churches of Cyric and later Kelemvor.\nAs of , the Thayan branch of the order was not supported by the reigning Red Wizards.\nThe order was formed after the people of Calimshan freed themselves from the Djen. Its original purpose was to teach people how they could attack and kill their former masters. Over time however, the monks developed an obsession with death. For their perverse fixation they were eventually run out of Calimshan.\nAs they were similarly expelled from every other place they attempted to settle in, save for Thay, the monks of the order became a semi-secret society in Faerûn. They established hidden monasteries all over the Realms where they could continue their studies in relative peace.\nThe Order of the Long Death attracted both morbid scholars and those individuals devoted to the deities of death, namely Kiaransalee, Velsharoon, Loviatar, and of course the successive gods of the dead Jergal, Myrkul, Cyric, and Kelemvor.\nBecoming a member of the order required first finding a monastery. Very few applicants were actually accepted—perhaps a dozen a year—and each one had to pass several tests of strength, agility and endurance before being inducted into the order fully.\nAny member who attempted to leave the order or spoke out against it publicly became a target for their killers.\n* Lenek the Cold The monk who served as the head of the Firesteap Mountains monastery.\n* Malark Springhill The assassin who served Szass Tam during the War of the Zulkirs.\n* Grimgnaw A dwarf monk associated with the Hero of Neverwinter during the Wailing Death."
