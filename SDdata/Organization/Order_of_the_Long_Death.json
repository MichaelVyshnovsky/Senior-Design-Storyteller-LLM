        "Activities": "Monks of the Long Death focused their energies on studying death and the art of killing. They learned about the effect of the process of death on living tissue.

        "Tactics": "When fighting against humanoid opponents, monks of the Long Death preferred to use their bare hands. When forced to fight some beast or monstrous creature, their weapon of choice was the [[kama]].",
        "Base of Operations": "There were at least three known monasteries of the Long Death. One in the eastern realm of [[Thay]], one in the [[Firesteap Mountains]] on the eastern edge of the [[Lake of Steam]], and the [[Abbot of the High Crypt]] within the [[Turnstone Hills]] in the [[Silver Marches]].\n\nThe order even established a small, secret school in the area of [[Scardale]].",
        "Possessions": "Within their monasteries, monks of the Long Death often kept shelves full of rare alchemical reagents and numerous specimens of dead animals and plant life.\n\nThe monks dressed in a manner that reflected their fascination with death, wearing dark hooded robes that hid their faces.",
        "Relationships": "While they were generally distrustful of others, the order were civil with those who sought to share any insights about death. Due to their narrow scope of interest they were seldom considered to be interesting or engaging by others. They did maintain a form of relationships with the [[church of Cyric|churches of Cyric]] and later [[church of Kelemvor|Kelemvor]].\n\nAs of {{Yearlink|1372}}, the Thayan branch of the order was not supported by the reigning [[Red Wizard]]s.",
        "History": "The order was formed after the people of [[Calimshan]] freed themselves from the [[Djen]]. Its original purpose was to teach people how they could attack and kill their former masters. Over time however, the monks developed an obsession with death. For their perverse fixation they were eventually run out of Calimshan.\n\nAs they were similarly expelled from every other place they attempted to settle in, save for Thay, the monks of the order became a semi-secret society in [[Faerûn]]. They established hidden monasteries all over the Realms where they could continue their studies in relative peace.",
        "Members": "The Order of the Long Death attracted both morbid scholars and those individuals devoted to the deities of death, namely [[Kiaransalee]], [[Velsharoon]], [[Loviatar]], and of course the successive gods of the dead: [[Jergal]], [[Myrkul]], [[Cyric]], and [[Kelemvor]].\n\nBecoming a member of the order required first finding a monastery. Very few applicants were actually accepted—perhaps a dozen a year—and each one had to pass several tests of strength, agility and endurance before being inducted into the order fully.\n\nAny member who attempted to leave the order or spoke out against it publicly became a target for their killers.",
        "Notable Monks of the Long Death": "* [[Lenek the Cold]]: The monk who served as the head of the [[Firesteap Mountains]] monastery.\n* [[Malark Springhill]]: The assassin who served [[Szass Tam]] during the [[War of the Zulkirs]].\n* [[Grimgnaw]]: A [[dwarf]] monk associated with the [[Hero of Neverwinter]] during the [[Wailing Death]].<ref>"
