        "mainbody": "'''The Agency''' was a mercenary adventuring company active in the early 1360s [[DR]].",
        "Membership": "The Agency had a very unusual roster of members: three [[elves]], namely a blade [[bard]], a [[bladesinger]], and a wilderness [[ranger]]; a [[tabaxi]]; an [[aarakocra]]; a [[cat hengeyokai|cat]] [[hengeyokai]]; a [[gnome]] [[priest]] with mechanical parts; and a [[human]] militant [[wizard]].\n\nThey were a former mercenary unit, and many of the members had worked with various mercenary companies, mainly the [[Mindulgulph Mercenary Company]]. For their experience with how mercenaries operated, a number of mercenary corps trusted them and hired them for special missions. They were considered to be almost a mercenary company themselves.",
        "History": "Before becoming the Agency, the original mercenary unit scuttled the ''[[Sea Jewel]]'', a ship of the [[Wraith of the Inner Sea]] privateering company, which was on a contract with [[Turmish]] at the time. The [[dromond]] sunk with all crew lost."
