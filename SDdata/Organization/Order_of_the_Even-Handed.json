        "mainbody": "The Order of the Even-Handed was a monastic order based in Waterdeep, dedicated to the tenets of Tyr.\nA relatively small organization, the Order consisted of monks, clerics, sacred fists, and fighters, all devoted worshipers of Tyr. The Order was based around Hlams Way of the Sacred Fists, a monastic discipline that combined elements of cleric and monk training.\nAlthough Hlam was Grand Master of the Order of the Even-Handed, he had little involvement with the organization, though he viewed it favorably.\nThe Even-Handed taught its members self-reliance, and bade them seek out injustice. Membership was open to most, as long as they had some talent at unarmed combat and swore vows of impartiality and devotion to Tyr.\nIt was expected that each member embark alone on a grand, Tyr-sanctioned adventure in their lifetime. Most members also sought to defeat monks of Helm in ritual combat.\nThe Order was based out of the House of Two Hands, a remote villa overlooking Smugglers Bay from the slopes of Mount Waterdeep.\nHammer Lord Hykros Allumen, leader of the Church of Tyr in Waterdeep, deeply disapproved of the Orders mixing of monk and cleric traditions. Therefore, the Order of the Even-Handed had closer ties to&mdashand paid their tithes to&mdashthe Hall of Justice in Neverwinter.\nThe Order of the Even-Handed was formed in the 14 century DR by disciples of Hlam, a reclusive monk who resided in a cave on Mount Waterdeep. Over the years, Hlam taught many students, who eventually organized themselves into the Order of the Even-Handed, receiving financial backing from Piergeiron the Paladinson to purchase a villa near Hlams cave.\n*Hlam, Grand Master of the Order.\n*Otho Delcourt, Master of the Left Hand.\n*Ella Fornyth, Master of the Right Hand.\n*Stoki, a gnomish adventurer."
