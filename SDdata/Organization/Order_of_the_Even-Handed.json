        "mainbody": "The '''Order of the Even-Handed''' was a [[monk|monastic]] order based in [[Waterdeep]], dedicated to the tenets of [[Tyr]].",
        "Organization": "A relatively small organization, the Order consisted of monks, [[cleric]]s, [[sacred fist]]s, and [[fighter]]s, all devoted worshipers of Tyr. The Order was based around [[Hlam]]'s [[Way of the Sacred Fists]], a monastic discipline that combined elements of cleric and monk training.\n\nAlthough Hlam was Grand Master of the Order of the Even-Handed, he had little involvement with the organization, though he viewed it favorably.",
        "Activities": "The Even-Handed taught its members self-reliance, and bade them seek out injustice. Membership was open to most, as long as they had some talent at unarmed combat and swore vows of impartiality and devotion to Tyr.\n\nIt was expected that each member embark alone on a grand, Tyr-sanctioned adventure in their lifetime. Most members also sought to defeat monks of [[Helm]] in ritual combat.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Order was based out of the [[House of Two Hands]], a remote villa overlooking [[Smuggler's Bay]] from the slopes of [[Mount Waterdeep]].",
        "Relationships": "Hammer Lord [[Hykros Allumen]], leader of the [[Church of Tyr]] in Waterdeep, deeply disapproved of the Order's mixing of monk and cleric traditions. Therefore, the Order of the Even-Handed had closer ties to&mdash;and paid their tithes to&mdash;the [[Hall of Justice]] in [[Neverwinter]].",
        "History": "The Order of the Even-Handed was formed in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] by disciples of Hlam, a reclusive monk who resided in a cave on Mount Waterdeep. Over the years, Hlam taught many students, who eventually organized themselves into the Order of the Even-Handed, receiving financial backing from [[Piergeiron the Paladinson]] to purchase a villa near Hlam's cave.",
        "Members": "*[[Hlam]], Grand Master of the Order.\n*[[Otho Delcourt]], Master of the Left Hand.\n*[[Ella Fornyth]], Master of the Right Hand.\n*[[Stoki]], a [[gnome|gnomish]] adventurer."
