        "mainbody": "The Speakers of the Shadow, who were called the Abuya-Deimshowa in the tongue of the Eshowe, were a cabal of shadow mages who served Eshowdow, the Shadow Giant within the Chultan pantheon.\nThe Speakers of the Shadow operated out of the Valley of Lost Honor within the Chultan jungles.\nMembers of this group governed the use of shadow magic among the Eshowe people. They worked closely with the clergy of Eshowdow, the Eshewtak, and even advised the chiefs of the various clans.\nNew members were initiated by traveling to the Shadowfell via the use of the shadow walk spell. If the applicant survived for one month and was able to return to the Valley of Lost Honor then they were accepted into the Speakers of the Shadow. Many members of the group transformed themselves into shades."
