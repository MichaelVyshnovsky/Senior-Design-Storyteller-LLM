        "Organization": "Members of this group governed the use of shadow magic among the Eshowe people. They worked closely with the clergy of Eshowdow, the [[Eshewtak]], and even advised the chiefs of the various clans.\n\nNew members were initiated by traveling to the [[Shadowfell]] via the use of the ''[[shadow walk]]'' [[spell]]. If the applicant survived for one month and was able to return to the Valley of Lost Honor then they were accepted into the Speakers of the Shadow. Many members of the group transformed themselves into [[shade]]s."
