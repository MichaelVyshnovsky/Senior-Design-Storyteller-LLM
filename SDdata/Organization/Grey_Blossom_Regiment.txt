The '''Grey Blossom Regiment''' was a [[mercenary]] company based in [[Nakamaru]] in [[Wa]].

==Description==
The company was composed of 500 [[bushi]] led by officers who were all no-caste [[Wanese]] or natives of Wa.

==History==
The Grey Blossom Regiment was formed from troops from [[Shou Lung]] who defected to Nakamaru's [[daimyo]] after the [[Oni War]] in [[251 DR|251]]. In time, they became mostly independent. In 1357 DR, the Regiment operated independently, and only had a [[samurai]] liaison officer appointed by the daimyo. For this reason, inside cities they were always watched by an equal numbers of the daimyo's soldiers. Despite this, most clans used Grey Blossom soldiers, including the [[Funada clan]]. The [[Many-Hued Peacock Society]] and the [[Royal Vagabonds]] kept an eye on the Grey Blossom Regiment.
