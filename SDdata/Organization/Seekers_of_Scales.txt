The '''Seekers of Scales''' was a [[dragon]] cult that operated out of [[Tarmalune]], one of the [[Windrise Ports]]. It was the oldest, largest, and wealthiest of the dragon cults of [[Laerakond]].{{Cite dragon/372/Backdrop: Tarmalune|59}}

==Organization==
The cult was composed mostly by [[dragonborn]] and [[human]]s, although a few individuals of other races were members as well. They were barely tolerated in Tarmalune, only allowed to exist because the citizens believed in freedom of choice. The Seekers met in secret in a high tower on the edge of Tarmalune.

Many people also suspected that most of the rulers of [[Sambral]] were part of the Seekers.{{Cite organized play/LFR/The Burning Scent of Perfumed Swords|50-52}}

==Activities==
Most people in Tarmalune believed the Seekers wanted to attune themselves and commune with dragons, usually a random wyrm nearby, though they could also select an individual dragon if they were aware of its proximity. To be able to achieve this mental state, the Seekers used [[drug]]s and [[herb]]s usually sold for other purposes. Some cultists believed that if they were able to attune with a dragon, they would learn their secrets, or at least the location of their hoards.

However, the true goal of the Seekers was to uncover the secrets that allowed a [[humanoid]] to transform into a dragon. The Seekers believed that such a transformation was a way to achieve godhood, as they believed dragons were akin to the [[god]]s themselves. They called this state of being ''"the Dreaming"''.
