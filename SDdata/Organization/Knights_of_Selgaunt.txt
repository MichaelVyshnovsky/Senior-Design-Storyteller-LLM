The '''Knights of Selgaunt''' were the true rulers of [[Selgaunt]] in [[Sembia]] in [[1358 DR]].<ref group="note">Forgotten Realms Adventures states that the Knights of Selgaunt were the rulers of Selgaunt and that they answered to Raithspur who was the Captain of the Guard in Ordulin ... so it remains unclear whether the Knights of Selgaunt was a military organization or a body of government.
