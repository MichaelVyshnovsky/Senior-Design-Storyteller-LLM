        "Base of Operations": "The main center of operations of the Sinkers was the City Armory of Sigil, although they also held bases and strongholds in all of the four [[Inner Planes]] that bordered the [[Negative Energy plane]]: the planes of [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Ash|Ash]], [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Dust|Dust]], [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Salt|Salt]], and [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Vacuum|Vacuum]].\n[[File:Doomguard-2e.jpg|thumb|left|The sigil of the Doomguards]]\nIn the Plane of Dust, the faction held a tower called [[Citadel Alluvius]], where everything slowly disintegrated into dust. They also built [[Citadel Exhalus]], the Portal of the Last Breath, on the border between the Negative Energy Plane and the Plane of Vacuum.\n\nThe Doomguard also kept numerous bases in the [[Abyss]], owing to the plane's natural affinity to decay and entropy. Their main base in the plane was located in the layer of [[Layers of the Abyss#Layer 12: Twelvetrees|Twelvetrees]], where the faction controlled great shipyards for the construction of [[ship of chaos|ships of chaos]].",
        "Relationships": "They found common ground with the [[Bleak Cabal]], a faction that believed nothing had any meaning, and the [[Dustmen]], who believed this life is nothing but a bleak [[afterlife]] to be transcended by reaching oblivion. On the other hand, the Doomguard was at odds with the [[Harmonium]] and the [[Fraternity of Order]], two factions that placed much importance on order.",
        "History": "The Doomguard was almost entirely destroyed during Sigil's [[Faction War (conflict)|Faction War]]. Unable to rebuild its former level of influence and organization, in part due to their philosophy of embracing natural decay as inevitable, the few survivors fled to the faction's strongholds in the Inner Planes.{{Cite dragon/315/Planescape: The Exiled Factions|46}}"
