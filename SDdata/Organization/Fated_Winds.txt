Fated Winds was a trading cartel active in Neverwinter in the late 14 century DR.
The Fated Winds coster was run by Jordan Wright circa 1374 DR. It was one of three major trade cartels granted offices within the Temple of Waukeen following the Shadow War in Neverwinters Tyrs Eye district.
Before the , Fated Winds had an unsavory reputation as there were many rumors that claimed that the coster had dealings with the Zhentarim. These rumors persisted up until the advent of the Shadow War. When the conflict was over, Northwest Faer√ªns trade suffered greatly. Lord Nasher Alagondar personally invited the Church of Waukeen to establish a temple in Neverwinter and aid the regions financial recovery. Fated Winds gained the trust of the church after they submitted the costers ledgers for an investigation that came up clean, observing them from any implied wrongdoings through the Black Network. Nevertheless, some merchants and members of the church still mistrusted Jordan Wright and his coster.
