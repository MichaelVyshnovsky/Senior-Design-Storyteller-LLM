'''Fated Winds''' was a trading cartel active in [[Neverwinter]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The Fated Winds coster was run by [[Jordan Wright]] ''circa'' [[1374 DR]]. It was one of three major trade cartels granted offices within the [[Temple of Waukeen (Neverwinter)|Temple of Waukeen]] following the [[Shadow War]] in Neverwinter's [[Tyr's Eye]] district.

==History==
Before the {{YearlinkName|1374}}, Fated Winds had an unsavory reputation as there were many rumors that claimed that the coster had dealings with the [[Zhentarim]]. These rumors persisted up until the advent of the Shadow War. When the conflict was over, [[Northwest Faer√ªn]]'s trade suffered greatly. Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]] personally invited the [[Church of Waukeen]] to establish a temple in Neverwinter and aid the region's financial recovery. Fated Winds gained the trust of the church after they submitted the coster's ledgers for an investigation that came up clean, observing them from any implied wrongdoings through the Black Network. Nevertheless, some merchants and members of the church still mistrusted Jordan Wright and his coster.
