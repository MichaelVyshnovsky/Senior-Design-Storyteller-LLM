        "mainbody": "The '''Knights of the Black Gauntlet''' were an order of [[Church of Bane|Banite]] [[crusader]]s and [[helmed horror]]s based in [[Mintar]] in the [[Lake of Steam (region)|Lake of Steam]] lands in the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were noteworthy for retaining their faith during the [[Bane|Dark Lord]]'s absence, following his death at the hands of [[Torm]] in the [[Time of Troubles]].",
        "Membership": "This evil brotherhood was ruled with an iron fist by [[Teldorn Darkhope]], [[Lord Knight Imperceptor]] of Bane. He commanded complete obedience in his knights. His indoctrination methods, which included a [[ritual]] and the use of ''[[dark promise]]'' [[spell]]s, caused new members to lose any semblance of their former personality.",
        "History": "On [[Midwinter's Eve]], in the {{YearlinkName|1362}}, a ghostly black hand appeared in the throne room of the ruling Mintaran satrap. Out of the hand stepped Teldorn, along with a small company of black knights, who then proceeded to slay the ruler and his guards. After seizing the throne and eradicating any leftover resistance, Teldorn began recruiting mercenaries from throughout the areas around the [[Lake of Steam]] into this unholy order of knights.\n\nAfter entrenching the Black Gauntlet within the region, Lord Knight Imperceptor Teldorn set his eye on the chaos of [[Tethyr]]. At the end of [[1369 DR]], he began mustering his dark knights to invade the city of [[Kzelter]], wanting to claim the stach of magic weapons located in the city."
