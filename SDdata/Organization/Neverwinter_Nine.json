The group was named after the nine guards of the founder of Neverwinter, Lord Halueth Never.\nAccording to legend, before the foundation of Neverwinter, Lord Halueth Never gathered a group of his most loyal guards and named them the Neverwinter Nine. Under his lead, the Nine and his army prevailed in the war with Illusk. However, two of them perished in the war, and one died as a traitor, for murdering his fellow Nine.

The artifact known as the Sigil of the Nine was used by the heroes of the Siege of Neverwinter. It called to the souls of the Neverwinter Nine to join in the battle to protect Neverwinter from peril.\nThe Neverwinter Nine of Lord Nashers time all wore magic armors and had magical swords, and also had access to all the magic items Lord Nasher had acquired during his career as an adventurer. believed to be a symbol of protection by the locals.\n* Talven\n* Galavren\n* Floashebel, the only known female of the group.\n* Thracier, the traitor, according to legend.\n* Shoce\n* Coneth\n* Nhalien\n* Tamper\n* Slade.\n* Kalach-Cha\n* Aribeth de Tylmarande\n* Callum\n* Darmon\n* Khelgar Ironfist\n* Melia Ceralle\n* Nevalle\n* Sedos Sebile\nAccording to legend, the ghosts of Lord Nashers Neverwinter Nine were bound to serve the heirs of the Alagondar bloodline."
