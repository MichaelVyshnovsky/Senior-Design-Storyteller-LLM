The '''Society of the Sword''' was the largest and oldest mercenary company in [[Chessenta]] and also active in the [[Vilhon Reach]] around [[1358 DR]].

==Organization==
===Contracts===
They wanted only high-profile jobs, never against a weak opponent. Employers were required to also pay for transportation, food, and additional equipment. They payed shares to the beneficiaries of slain members. They charged 1500 [[gold piece]]s per week for their services, or 300 gp per day for shorter jobs.

==History==
The Society was founded in the mid-1200s [[DR]]. During [[Stilmus]]'s leadership, the Society was obsessed by honor and developed a grudge against the [[Renegades]].
