The '''Six Spiked Rings''' were an [[adventuring company]] from [[Turmish]].

==History==
In [[1370 DR|the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]], the Six Spiked Rings visited the town of [[Ylraphon]] in [[the Vast]] and explored the [[House of Moander]] temple of the god [[Moander]].

Greater darktentacles attacked and killed some of their number, but two escaped with treasures won from the temple: a large bag of gems, and a sack of metal magic [[wand]]s of great age and power.
