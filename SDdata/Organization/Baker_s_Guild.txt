The '''Baker's Guild''' was an organization of united, skilled bakers that operated within the city of [[Waterdeep]]. They were an extremely wealthy and influential guild that was renowned for the high-quality goods they produced.. The guild had the interests of other businesses looking for investments, which increased the influence of the guild and individual bakers with other guilds and merchants).<ref name="CoSbxWWiW-p38>

Their livery consisted of white cloaks and hats highlighted with a light blue chevron on the left shoulder or brim.<ref name="CoSbxWWiW-p38>

==Activities==
In addition to the tasty breads and pastries the guild produced, which formed the majority of many Waterdhavians' diets, they garnered the attention of a great many [[thieves]] from throughout the city.<ref name="CoSbxWWiW-p38>

As a result, the guild hired dedicated "runners" to ensure their orders were safely delivered to their intended destinations. In addition, these private escorts acted as bodyguards and even chased down anyone who attempted to intercept their wares. While they had no "official" authority within the city, they were often given relative free reign by the [[City Watch (Waterdeep)|City Watch]].<ref name="CoSbxWWiW-p38>

==Membership==
Guild membership cost 10 [[gp]], with an annual fee of 5 [[sp]] per month. Entrance into the guild had to be approved upon application by the Master and the "Master Bakers" (the ten most-senior members of the guild).<ref name="CoSbxWWiW-p38>
