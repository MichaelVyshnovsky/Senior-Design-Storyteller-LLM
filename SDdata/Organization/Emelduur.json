        "mainbody": "Emelduur was the name of a rich and influential family in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR. They were one of the twenty Onsruur families&mdashhuman Houses that each had a seat on the council of lords.\nThe Emelduur bloodline favored short, supple bodies and handsome features. They were a talkative bunch with seemingly boundless energy. The children were raised on schemes and intrigue until it was second nature to them.\nThe Emelduur clan made their fortune by pushing quick deals, being first into a market, and manipulating commodities and other players to their advantage. Given the choice, they preferred the excitement of speedy transactions in a changing environment over forming a long-term plan and seeing it through."
