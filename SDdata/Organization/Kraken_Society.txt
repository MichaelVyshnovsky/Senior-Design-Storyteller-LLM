The '''Kraken Society''' was a secret society of [[thieves]], [[assassin]]s and [[mage]]s in the [[Savage Frontier]]. Its purpose was to maintain an information network throughout [[the North]], and it was secretly led by the [[kraken]], [[Slarkrethel]]. It had its headquarters in the [[Purple Rocks]], and their main fortress in the ruins of [[Ascarle]].

==History==
The Kraken Society's far-reaching organization began in the cities of the North.

Some time after the [[War of the Silver Marches]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[dragon]] [[Iymrith]] contacted agents of the society for aid. Slarkrethel ordered its followers to go along with the dragon's plans, by slaying the [[storm giant]] Queen [[Neri]] and capturing King [[Hekaton]].

==Notable Members==
*[[Khaspere Drylund]] of [[Yartar]], the proprietor of the [[Grand Dame]] in the late 15{{th}} century DR.
*[[The Prioress]], the High Priestess of [[Umberlee]] from the [[Priory of the Depths]] in the late 14{{th}} century DR.
