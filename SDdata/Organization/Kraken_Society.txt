The Kraken Society was a secret society of thieves, assassins and mages in the Savage Frontier. Its purpose was to maintain an information network throughout the North, and it was secretly led by the kraken, Slarkrethel. It had its headquarters in the Purple Rocks, and their main fortress in the ruins of Ascarle.
The Kraken Societys far-reaching organization began in the cities of the North.
Some time after the War of the Silver Marches in the late 15 century DR, the dragon Iymrith contacted agents of the society for aid. Slarkrethel ordered its followers to go along with the dragons plans, by slaying the storm giant Queen Neri and capturing King Hekaton.
