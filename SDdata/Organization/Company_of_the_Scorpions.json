        "History": "The first commander was [[Tyzack]], a paranoid man living in fear of people discovering that in his youth he had briefly rebelled against the [[Zhentarim]].{{cite book/Tantras|10-330}}\n\nThe Company did not participate in the [[Battle of Shadowdale]], instead being busy with a mission ordered by the god [[Bane]] in person to try to find a lost powerful [[magic]]al artifact in [[Archendale]]. However, their search was in vain.\n\nLater, they were among the many troops that Bane ordered to converge on [[Scardale]]. On the way, the Company of the Scorpions met the then-[[human]] [[Cyric]]. Cyric soon rose through the Company's ranks and thanks to a \"strange\" incident became the new commander of the Company. In Scardale, Bane was satisfied by the Company's operations and elevated them to an elite corp directly under his control. He also reassigned most of the men. The Company at this point were led by Cyric and the lieutenant [[Dalzhel]].\n\nThey fought at [[Tantras]] while Cyric carried out a secret mission behind the enemy lines.\n\nAfter the death of Bane, the Company of the Scorpions went rogue under the command of Cyric in his hunt for the [[Tablets of Fate]]. After some skirmishes with the heroes [[Midnight]], [[Adon]], and [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]], most of the company were killed by the god of assassins, [[Bhaal]], also in search of the Tablets. In the end, only Cyric remained, effectively dissolving the Company.{{cite book/Waterdeep|1-223}}",
