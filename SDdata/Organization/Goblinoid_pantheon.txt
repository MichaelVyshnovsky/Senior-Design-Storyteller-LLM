The goblinoid pantheon was the pantheon of deities worshiped by goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears.
Maglubiyet was the chief deity of the goblinoid pantheon. Other members of the pantheon included Bargrivyek, Nomog-Geaya, Khurgorbaeyag, Hruggek, and Grankhul.
Goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears once had their own individual pantheons the goblin pantheon, hobgoblin pantheon, and bugbear pantheon. However, Maglubiyet killed most of the gods of these pantheons and forced the others to kneel to him. The deities conquered by Maglubiyet thus fell into these two categories. After this, a single unified pantheon was formed the goblinoid pantheon. The individual deities were now solely subservient to Maglubiyet, the Conquering God. Since Maglubiyets successful crusade, the other deities feared his power and wrath.
