The '''Shield of the Lady''' was a militant order of woman [[wizard]]s, [[cleric]]s, and priestesses devoted to [[Isis]] around [[1370 DR]]. Their duty was to protect [[Mulhorand]]i heroes from evil and barbarism.

These spellcasters joined and assisted adventuring companies operating within [[Mulhorand]] and the [[Old Empires]] and beyond, on missions that furthered the aims of the goddess.<ref>
