The Shield of the Lady was a militant order of woman wizards, clerics, and priestesses devoted to Isis around 1370 DR. Their duty was to protect Mulhorandi heroes from evil and barbarism.
These spellcasters joined and assisted adventuring companies operating within Mulhorand and the Old Empires and beyond, on missions that furthered the aims of the goddess.
