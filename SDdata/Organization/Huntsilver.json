        "mainbody": "'''Huntsilver''' was a noble house of [[Cormyr]]. An \"old blood\" family, it was considered one of the Royal Houses, owing to its close ties to the [[Obarskyr]] royal line.<ref>",
        "Base": "The family lived in [[Huntsilver Palace]],<ref> situated beyond the [[Royal Gardens]] in [[Suzail]].\n\nThey also had holdings in [[Dhedluk (town)|Dhedluk]] and [[Thunderstone]].",
        "History": "After the [[Silver (human house)|Silver]] family split, they formed the Huntsilver, [[Truesilver]], and [[Crownsilver]] families. The Huntsilvers were established by [[245 DR]].<ref>\n\nThe Huntsilvers chose not to take sides when civil war erupted between Regent [[Salember]] and Prince [[Rhigaerd II]] in the {{YearlinkName|1268}}. Instead, they equivocated when Salember demanded soldiers and aid.<ref>\n\nIn the event of King [[Azoun IV]]'s presumed death in the [[abraxus incident]], the Huntsilvers were among those families who preferred replacing the monarchy with a ruling council, rather than a regency, in order to free Cormyr from what they saw as Obarskyr tyranny.<ref>\n\nThe fortunes of the Huntsilver family wavered for a while, when their sons died in wars with [[Sembia]]. Their daughters had been married to the [[Crownsilver]]s and [[Truesilver]]s, and were still awaiting heirs.{{Cite dungeon/198/Cormyr Royale: The Royal Court of the Forest Kingdom}} Eventually, their fortunes must have shifted, for in the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, they were a strong enough force for [[Raedra Obarskyr]] to look to for acknowledgement of her ascension.",
        "Personality": "The Huntsilver family was seen as aloof in the mid–14{{th}} century.<ref>",
        "Activities": "The Huntsilvers were historically focused on managing Cormyr's forests and their resources. In the early years of the kingdom, the family organized the systematic development of forests for farmland. In the 14th century, Huntsilvers had a prominent role in clearing the [[Hullack Forest]].\n\nMembers of the Huntsilver family rarely appeared at the Royal Court, except on important occasions or on issues regarding the forests of Cormyr.",
