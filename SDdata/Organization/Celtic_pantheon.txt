The '''Celtic pantheon''', formerly known as the '''Tuatha De Danann''', one of the most adaptable and influential in all the [[Outer Planes]]. A number of its members were known of or worshiped in the Realms.

==Description==
The members of this pantheon largely resembled [[human]]s. They had a reputation among some as being dark and brooding, but in actuality were much more carefree compared to most pantheons. To varying extents its members all loved beauty, knowledge, and life. They also highly valued cunning, hospitality, song, and strength. But above all they preached freedom of choice to their followers and respect for nature.

As a whole the members of this pantheon were incredibly inclusive and tolerant of others. This was to such an extent that they didn't even demand total loyalty from their worshipers and they were willing to welcome most any deity into their pantheon, so long as they shared those aforementioned basic attitudes.

When it came to establishing themselves on other worlds, the Celtic gods were willing to adapt themselves to fit niches similar to their own portfolios.

==Base of Operations==
With some exceptions, the members of this pantheon chiefly resided in the [[divine realm]] of [[Tir na Og]] in the [[Outlands]], with each of them maintaining a separate divine realm within its borders that had their own peculiarities.

The deity [[Arawn]] resided on the island of [[Annwn]], amidst a vast ocean in [[Niflheim]], where the pantheon's disreputable [[petitioner]]s were sent. [[Belenus]] and [[Brigantia]] jointly ruled the divine realm of the [[Isles of the Blessed]] in [[Elysium]], where heroes who sought to do good in their lives were sent. it was part of a lake at the base of the [[Spire]].<ref>

==Notable Members==

;Arawn: The Celtic god of life and death.
;Belenus: The Celtic god of heat, the light, and the sun.
;Brigantia: The Celtic goddess of livestock and rivers.
;[[Cerunnos]]: Also known as the '''Master of the Hunt''', was an [[archfey]]{{Cite web/theedverse/2021-06-11 - Celtic pantheon}} and the Celtic god of hunting, who brought a haunting phenomenon known as the [[Wild Hunt]] to any land where the pantheon was worshiped. Or sicked it upon anyone foolish enough to muck about with the freedom of Tir na Og.
;Creidhne: Once a lesser deity of craftsmen, this god became a proxy of Goibhniu after they gave up their power to raise him to an [[intermediate deity|intermediate power]].Nowhere is it stated that Creidhne and Luchta were [[lesser deity|lesser deities]]. However, because Goibhniu was previously listed in 1{{st}} edition's [[Deities & Demigods 1st edition|''Deities and Demigods'']] as a lesser deity, his rise in status in the 2{{nd}} edition source ''[[On Hallowed Ground]]'' is interpreted to mean that Creidhne and Luchta were both equivalently lesser deities.
;[[Daghdha]]: Also known as the '''dozen king''', was the Celtic god of weather and the head of the pantheon.
;Diancecht: The Celtic god of healing and medicine.
;[[Dunatis]]: The Celtic god of mountains.

==History==
According to ancient legends, the Celtic pantheon began with many members being born to a goddess known as [[Danu]] on a fabled island, but no evidence of her existence could be found. The [[Believers of the Source]] claimed that she had likely moved on to a form of existence even greater than that of the deities, perhaps becoming an [[overgod]].

Other legends claimed that the Celtic gods sprang forth from nature itself.
===History on Toril===
Over the course of the planet of [[Toril]]'s history, there were waves of planar immigrants that came from [[Wikipedia:Ireland|a rugged land]] on [[Earth|another world]] with a culture tied to nature, the sea, and the warrior history of its dozen-king greater god. These brought their own societies and the worship of the Celtic gods, such as Herne and Oghma.<ref> One wave settled in the kingdom of [[Bakar]], in the city of [[Medinat Muskawoon]]. There they constructed temples to the Celtic gods, such as Dunatis. While another, later wave of planar immigrants from the same rugged land would settle around the time of the rise of [[Netheril]].

In later centuries Oghma would go on to join the [[Adama]] and [[Faer没nian pantheon|Faer没nian]] pantheons, while Sylvanus would join him in the latter Faer没nian, with both deities having established themselves on Toril due to being pushed out of powers among the Celts.<ref> Herne would go on to be worshiped by [[orc]] tribes in [[northwest Faer没n]]'s [[High Forest]].

==Relationships==
When establishing themselves on [[Prime Material plane|Prime Material]] worlds, the Celtic pantheon was known to take in deities from a world's local pantheon or to join those pantheons themselves. This thereby ensured the Celtic pantheon's own continued growth and survival.

The location of Tir na Og attracted some tension (for the reason why, see the "Worshipers" section), but the pantheon did its best to remain neutral in planar affairs, albeit with some exceptions. The goddess Morrigan also got involved with the Blood War on occasion, sending her proxies to whip the fiends into a fighting frenzy.<ref>

Some individuals in this Pantheon were not directly worshiped on Toril, though they did have relations with deities that were. For instance, many of them were on good terms with [[Sheela Peryroyl]]{{Cite dragon/59/Gods of the Halflings|52}}{{FRCS-Unearthed Legends}} and [[Bahamut]].<ref> And Daghda was fervent friends with trickster deities, such as [[Erevan Ilesere]] and [[Garl Glittergold]], 

The [[Olympian pantheon]] were considered their primary rivals due to its opposing, insular nature. The head of the Celtic pantheon, Daghdha, thought the Olympians weren't any match for them and that they were too full of themselves and Zeus forbid the Olympians from fraternizing with the Celtic gods. Though not all members of either pantheon felt animosity. For example, Goibhniu had a secret friendship with [[Apollo]] and often compared notes or skills with [[Hephaestus]], though the latter was sometimes his rival.

When it came to the [[Norse pantheon]], Odin sometimes acted as a mediator between the Celtic and Olympian powers. Though at other times, he would send [[Loki]] to cause mischief among them.

==Worshipers==
The Celtic pantheon was as often served by [[druid]]s as by [[cleric]]s, for they were closely aligned with the forces of nature. Their religious services were performed in groves consecrated by the planting of [[holly]] and [[mistletoe]].

Due to Tir na Og being situated in the Outlands, a plane that touched all of the [[Outer Planes]], the [[divine power]] of this pantheon's priests wasn't hindered anywhere in the [[Great Wheel cosmology|Great Wheel]]. This made them quite popular among planar travelers. The location, as well as the pantheon's adaptable and inclusive nature, all contributed to them being quite prominent across the Prime Material plane.

Some [[halfling]] druids on Toril worshiped Daghdha, Lugh, or Sylvanus. Though this was not a common practice.{{FRCS-Unearthed Legends}}

On the [[Elemental Plane of Water]], Manannan Mac Lir was one of the many ajami ocean gods that [[marid]]s had a shrine to within the [[Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls]].<ref><ref group="note" name="note4">The word "ajami" in general means "outlander" in the [[Midani language]].
