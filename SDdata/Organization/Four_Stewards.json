All judges and lawyers of the kingdom were appointed and employed by the Steward of the Sky. Although this theoretically granted the Steward of the Sky great power, they had no direct control over who was brought to trial, as that was the domain of the Steward of Fire. Additionally, the monarch’s judgment was the highest law, and they could overrule the Steward of the Sky’ rulings."
