        "Activities": "Because of their dislike of the subjugation of their tribe to the [[Khalil al-Assad al-Zahir|Grand Caliph]] in [[Huzuz]], the Riders of Blood frequently targeted trade caravans traveling between Huzuz and [[Halwa]].\n\nAll potential caravan targets were carefully scouted before any attack was made. A favored tactic was to have several [[elemental mage|wind mages]] batter the caravans with wind and sand for a few days before striking with lancers and bowmen.",
        "Organization": "The Riders of Blood fielded 250 skilled fighting men and women and several wizards. [[Fasim Kaldur]] was their leader.\n\nMany of the Riders favored the [[jambiya]] since it was a symbol of freedom throughout the Land of Fate.",
        "Members": "Though most of its members were humans, [[elf|elves]] and [[Half-elf|half-elves]] were welcomed so long as they proved their loyalty to the Riders."
