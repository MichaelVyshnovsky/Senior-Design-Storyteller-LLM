        "mainbody": "he Rus were an Illuskan tribe.\nMany centuries before the 14 century DR, the Rus raided much of coastal Faer√ªn, with some bands even sailing the rivers further inland.\nIn , a group of Rus led by chieftain Yvengi were transported onto the eastern shore of Lake Ashane in Raumathar by way of a malfunctioning portal in the Whalebones.In Volos Guide to All Things Magical, the Rus are described as having arrived in Rashemen by way of a chain of lakes and rivers, but this was contradicted in the later Champions of Ruin and The Grand History of the Realms, which state that their arrival was the result of a malfunctioning portal. The Rus integrated with the native Rashemi of the region, and their presence was credited with sparking the insurrection that would displace Eltab in , led by the half-Rus and half-Rashemi warrior hero also named Yvengi.\n* Alfgar\n* Hanigard\n* Hrothgar\n* Toth\n* Vasha\n* Yvengi\n* Yvengi"
