The "community of the high brows" was a mountain giant tribe dwelling in the Orbrekh in the Orsraun Mountains of Turmish.
The community of the high brows was led by Oogle, its shaman, in the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR. There were about 30 to 35 mountain giants in the tribe.
The giants wished only to be left alone in peace. Their relative peacefulness made the Orbrekh the safest part of the Orsrauns for travellers.
The mountain giants decimated the Onusclan orcs, who dwelt in the northern Orsrauns, whenever they crossed into the Orbrekh.
The community had an unknown relationship with the Emerald Enclave, which saw Enclave druids regularly visiting the tribe.
