The '''"community of the high brows"''' was a [[mountain giant]] tribe dwelling in the [[Orbrekh]] in the [[Orsraun Mountains]] of [[Turmish]].

==Organization==
The community of the high brows was led by [[Oogle]], its [[shaman]], in [[1370 DR|the Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR]]. There were about 30 to 35 mountain giants in the tribe.

==Behavior==
The giants wished only to be left alone in peace. Their relative peacefulness made the Orbrekh the safest part of the Orsrauns for travellers.

==Relationships==
The mountain giants decimated the [[Onusclan]] [[orc]]s, who dwelt in the northern Orsrauns, whenever they crossed into the Orbrekh.

The community had an unknown relationship with the [[Emerald Enclave]], which saw Enclave [[druids]] regularly visiting the tribe.
