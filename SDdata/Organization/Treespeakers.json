        "mainbody": "All treespeakers were female [[elf]] maidens possessed of poise and purity and effortless grace and who easily communed with nature.

However, they spurned all romantic activities, including harmless flirting, and defended themselves firnmly against all advances.\n\nTreespeakers pledged their service for two decades at a time through a vow of purity. At the end of this period, they could choose to renew their pledge or become a regular priestess of Mielikki. Any treespeaker breaking their vow would instantly lost all of their granted powers, including the friendship of the unicorn.",
        "Activities": "They loved nature and fought fiercely to defend it. However, while they did all they could to defend nature, they preferred to remain unseen while performing their duties to [[Mielikki]] and the forest but would reveal themselves if necessary. The church monitored them closely.\n\nTreespeakers rode [[unicorn]] companions with whom they had a close bond. In some cases, the unicorns were known to run into certain death to rescue their treespeakers.",

        "Abilities": "Regular priests in most respects, treespeakers could learn to ''[[speak with plants]]'' at will.

        "Possessions": "Treespeakers wore mundane [[chainmail]] or [[elven chainmail]] and ''[[cloak of elvenkind|cloaks of elvenkind]]''. Most favored the [[short sword]] and [[longbow]] for weaponry. All of this equipment was provided by the church.",
