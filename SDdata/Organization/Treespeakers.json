        "mainbody": "he treespeakers were specialty priests and an order of the Church of Mielikki who protected nature at all costs.\nThey loved nature and fought fiercely to defend it. However, while they did all they could to defend nature, they preferred to remain unseen while performing their duties to Mielikki and the forest but would reveal themselves if necessary. The church monitored them closely.\nTreespeakers rode unicorn companions with whom they had a close bond. In some cases, the unicorns were known to run into certain death to rescue their treespeakers.\nAll treespeakers were female elf maidens possessed of poise and purity and effortless grace and who easily communed with nature. They were either gold elves or moon elves, and had a reputation for beauty and charm. Though quite serious about their duty to protect the forest, they also enjoyed having fun when they could. However, they spurned all romantic activities, including harmless flirting, and defended themselves firnmly against all advances.\nTreespeakers pledged their service for two decades at a time through a vow of purity. At the end of this period, they could choose to renew their pledge or become a regular priestess of Mielikki. Any treespeaker breaking their vow would instantly lost all of their granted powers, including the friendship of the unicorn.\nRegular priests in most respects, treespeakers could learn to speak with plants at will. After undertaking a special vigil at a grove sacred to Mielikki, an experienced treespeaker would be greeted by a unicorn that would become their ally, friend, and companion mount, not a servant.\nThey could not turn undead nor cast any spells from the necromantic or guardian spheres.\nTreespeakers wore mundane chainmail or elven chainmail and cloaks of elvenkind. Most favored the short sword and longbow for weaponry. All of this equipment was provided by the church.\n* Elanalue Sharrith, a moon elf from the Border Forest and last known holder of Yornars Trail Companion"
