House LeQuella was a moon elf house known for its unconventional dress sense and the contentious (but friendly) relations between its members.
As of 1368 DR it was led by Huquethae LeQuella. Its estate was in Leuthilspar, on Evermeet, and consisted of a magically grown building of wood and leaves.
The house colors were orange, red, and yellow, and its symbol depicted a triangle of each of these colors displayed on a white background.
