'''House Le'Quella''' was a [[moon elf]] house known for its unconventional dress sense and the contentious (but friendly) relations between its members.

As of [[1368 DR]] it was led by [[Huquethae Le'Quella]]. Its estate was in [[Leuthilspar]], on [[Evermeet]], and consisted of a magically grown building of wood and leaves.

The house colors were orange, red, and yellow, and its symbol depicted a triangle of each of these colors displayed on a white background.
