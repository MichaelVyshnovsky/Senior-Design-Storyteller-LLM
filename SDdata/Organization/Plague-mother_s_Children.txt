The '''Plague-mother's Children''' was a [[guild]] of [[Talona]]-worshiping thugs infesting [[Chondath]] and the [[Vilhon Reach]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}}.

==Activities==
The guild was once composed of [[crusader]]s dedicated to prolonging the [[Rotting War]] to earn Talona's favor. However, the guild's members degenerated over the years to an informal collection of cutthroats whose primary goal was running extortion schemes. They threatened to unleash the wrath of the Lady of Poison if they weren't paid.
