The Axe of Mirabar was the two-thousand strong militia of Mirabar, consisting of humans and five hundred dwarves.
It was commanded by Torgar Hammerstriker.
The Axe was responsible for keeping the mines of Mirabar clear of monsters.
Its members wore the crest of Mirabar (a deep-red double-bladed axe with a pointed haft and a flaring, flat base on a black field) on their shield or armor. They fought with crossbows, lances, and hammers, riding mountain ponies, and rothé in the winter.
New members had to take an oath to protect the Marchion of Mirabar.
