The Wolfmasters were a Sembite adventuring company that operated until their gruesome demise in 1369 DR. Their symbol was a wolfs head transfixed with a longsword.
In the , the Wolfmasters struggled to pay for their Cormyrean adventuring charter, putting them at risk of arrest. Desperate for a large windfall, they pursued rumors of treasure in the Vast Swamp and found Orvaskyte Keep, coordinating with the Ruby Blades company to join forces in the dangerous quest. Unfortunately for them, the Ruby Blades were delayed and the Wolfmasters ran into a cornugon devil, which gleefully dismembered all six of them.
They were avenged when Registrant General Lord Partic Thistle sent another group of adventurers after them to discern their status. The adventurers encountered the cornugon themselves, destroyed it, and reported back to Lord Thistle on the fate of the Wolfmasters.
