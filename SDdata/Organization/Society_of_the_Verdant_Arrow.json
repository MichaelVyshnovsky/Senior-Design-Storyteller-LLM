        "Organization": "The Society advocated for the banishment of [[human]]s from [[Aglarond]], thereby returning it to the way things were during the days of the [[Yuir elves]]. The members were particularly frustrated by the often-absent human ruler of Aglarond, [[the Simbul]], and strongly opposed the [[Sons of Hoar]].\n\nThe organization was led by [[Guthrae]] in [[1368 DR]], and later [[Caytran Halvasyn]] in [[1374 DR]].",
        "Members": "The organization was made up of the [[half-elf]] descendants of Lady [[Mytela Halvasyn]], namely those with significant wealth."
