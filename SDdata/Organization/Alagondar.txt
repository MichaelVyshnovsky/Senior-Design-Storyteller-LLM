House '''Alagondar''' was a royal family that ruled the city of [[Neverwinter]] after the death of Lord [[Nasher Alagondar]], in [[1385 DR]], and until the [[Ruining]] of [[1451 DR]], when the entire family disappeared in the disaster.

==Activities==
The Alagondar family ruled Neverwinter, and during their brief mandate they were able to keep the city stable and prosperous.

==Residence==
The Alagondar family owned [[Castle Never]].

==History==
The Alagondar family was founded by the descendants of Lord Nasher Alagondar after his death, who was considered the first patriarch of the family.

According to some conflicting records, Lord Nasher had a bastard son, [[Vers Never]], who left the city and settled in [[Waterdeep]], marrying [[Mirtria Ember]] and founding the [[Neverember]] family.

The Alagondar line of kings and queens ruled their city fairly and well and were loved and revered by their subjects,

House Alagondar disappeared with the destruction of Neverwinter in 1451 DR, when the cataclysm caused by the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]] destroyed Neverwinter. One story claimed that the last Alagondar king was so arrogant that he believed he could survive anything even as the eruption killed him.

According to some unreliable and unconfirmed sources, [[Dagult Neverember]] was a descendant of Vers Nevers, and henceforth an indirect descendant of the Alagondar family. Dagult used those sources to claim for himself the throne of Neverwinter in [[1469 DR]], acting as a Lord Protector instead of a king to not alienate the citizens.

===Legacy===
In [[1474 DR]], the [[Sons of Alagondar]] emerged in Neverwinter and waged a campaign of insurgency and propaganda against the rule of Dagult Neverember. Proclaiming themselves as the descendants of the servants and retainers of Lord Nasher and his descendants, they wished to restore rule to the rightful line of Alagondar.

In [[1479 DR]], a self-proclaimed "[[Seldra Tylmarande|Lost Heir]]" of the dynasty appeared in Neverwinter and led an insurrection against Lord Neverember, however they were eventually proven to be an imposter.

==Known Members==
* [[Nasher Alagondar]], the patriarch and founder of the family.
* [[Bann Alagondar]], son of Lord Nasher and second king of Neverwinter.
* [[Tanamere Alagondar]], scion of Alagondar buried at the [[Dragon Barrow]].
* [[Vers Never]], bastard son of Lord Nasher and younger brother of Bann.
* [[Dagult Neverember]], presumed descendant of Vers Never.
* [[Elyne Tschavarz]], the only confirmed descendant of Alagondar living in Neverwinter as of 1479 DR.

==Rumors & Legends==
According to some rumors, not all members of the Alagondar family perished during the eruption of Mount Hotenow. It was believed that a woman of the Alagondar lineage, who was pregnant at the moment the eruption took place, fled during the destruction of Neverwinter and survived long enough to give birth to her child. She later succumbed to madness because of the grief of having lost all her family, dying shortly thereafter. The child, now the last surviving member of the Alagondar bloodline, was adopted by the [[Nobility of Waterdeep|Waterdhavian house]] [[House Thann|Thann]] and raised as one of their own.

In the late years of the 15th century [[DR]], many [[adventurer]]s claimed to be that lost heir of Neverwinter, but most of them were put to the sword by Dagult Neverember, who would not suffer the presence of a bothersome claimant to his "rightful throne". It was rumored that one such Alagondar heir fled to [[Icewind Dale]], and resided there as of [[1489 DR]].

Another legend told about the lost ''[[Crown of Neverwinter]]'', a [[magic]] crown that only a true heir of the Alagondar line could use. People that didn't have Alagondar blood were killed on the spot by the [[magic item]] if they attempted to use it.

Likewise, it was believed that the [[ghost]]s of the [[Neverwinter Nine]] would only kneel before a true heir of the Alagondar bloodline.
