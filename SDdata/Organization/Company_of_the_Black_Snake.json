        "mainbody": "he Company of the Black Snake was an adventuring group based around Waterdeep in the first half of the 13 century DR.\nThe group was composed of elves, humans, two dwarves, and two halflings.\nThe adventuring group was known to operate out of Waterdeep.\nThe company was a group well known for their battle prowess, with detailed and organized formations. Their diverse membership allowed them to flank enemies and strike hard from behind with bows and halberds.\nThe groups tactics failed them in 1252 DR and they were wiped out by a superior unknown group. The groups best halberdier, Bedwyn Fayr, and the halfling Pep Greenfields were the only survivors.\nAfter the adventuring group dissolved, Fayr and Greenfields considered their lucky survival a sign from Tymora. They hung up their weapons and sold their adventuring gear and opened a profitable antique shop in Waterdeep. Fayrs halberd was sold by Fayr himself to a smithy in Kuldahar."
