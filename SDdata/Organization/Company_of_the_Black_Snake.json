        "mainbody": "The '''Company of the Black Snake''' was an adventuring group based around [[Waterdeep]] in the first half of the 13{{th}} century DR.",
        "Membership": "The group was composed of [[elves]], [[humans]], two [[dwarves]], and two [[halflings]].",
        "Regions": "The adventuring group was known to operate out of Waterdeep.",
        "Tactics": "The company was a group well known for their battle prowess, with detailed and organized formations. Their diverse membership allowed them to flank enemies and strike hard from behind with [[bow]]s and [[halberd]]s.",
        "History": "The group's tactics failed them in [[1252 DR]] and they were wiped out by a superior unknown group. The group's best halberdier, [[Bedwyn Fayr]], and the [[halfling]] [[Pep Greenfields]] were the only survivors.\n\nAfter the adventuring group dissolved, Fayr and Greenfields considered their lucky survival a sign from [[Tymora]]. They hung up their weapons and sold their adventuring gear and opened a profitable antique shop in Waterdeep. ''[[Fayr's halberd]]'' was sold by Fayr himself to a smithy in [[Kuldahar]]."
