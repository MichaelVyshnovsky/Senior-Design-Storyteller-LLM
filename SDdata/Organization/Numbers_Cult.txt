The Numbers Cult was a secret society of mages and mathematicians in Chessenta in the midâ€“14 century DR. They worked to define magic in terms of mathematics. They believed the resulting equations would conquer the world! However, their basic premise was apparently based on a fallacy.
The philosopher of Cimbar, Heptios the Archmage, had been rumored to be involved in the Numbers Cult, but he disavowed any connection with them by 1357 DR.
