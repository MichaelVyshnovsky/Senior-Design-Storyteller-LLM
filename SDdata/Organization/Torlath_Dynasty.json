        "mainbody": "Torlath was the ruling dynasty of Amn from the foundation of the realm in 460 DR to 1095 DR.\nThe dynasty was founded in the  by General Esmel, who seized the Emirate of Amin following the rapid collapse of the Shoon Imperium in 450 DR. Naming himself the King of Amn, he controlled the cities of Athkatla, Murann, and Crimmor, with the realm extending to Lake Esmel in the east. His grandchildren Imnel and Amnur proved capable and warlike men, and the royal line proceeded on with generally successful kings for centuries who expanded and enriched the realm.\nThe family faced a grave threat in the , however, when Arbas the Usurper slew almost the entire royal family including King Esmel IV and took the throne for himself. He was shortly after eliminated by the royal son Jhanos, who continued the much-winnowed family through a line of six \"Wizard-Kings\" who had long reigns, albeit disinterested ones that allowed the noble houses, merchant clans, and trade companies of the realm to gather increasingly large amounts of influence and power.\nThe Torlaths were finally obliterated between 1094 DR and 1095 DR. King Imnel IV was slain by assassins, followed by King Niskam the Doomed, King Rhor the Lackey, and King Dornak the Puppet King as the Braethar and Villax merchant houses attempted to control the throne. The Torlaths were wiped out, though the Wavegold family was able to claim a line of descent from the early royal Princess Jamyll and so took the throne for themselves in order to save the realm from a civil war.\nThe Tanislove family was actually a continuation from the Torlaths, though it was kept secret. The catastrophe of the Sothillisian War in 1370 DR convinced Pehllus Tanislove that the Council of Six was hopelessly corrupt and ineffective, leading to a conspiracy with the Knights of the Shield that would see the monarchy restored through the Tanisloves."
