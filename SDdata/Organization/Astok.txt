The '''Astok''' were a tribe of [[Zakharan (ethnicity)|Zakharans]] inhabiting the hills and [[Furrowed Mountains]] near [[Umara]].

==History==
[[Ubar khel Muhif]], the leader or Khan of the Astok, led a revolution within Umara by staging a coup in the palace. After succeeding, he married the former Caliph's daughter and claimed the throne for himself. Many barbarians of the Astok migrated to live within Umara after the revolt, but tensions remained high between them and the native Umarans.

The Astok worshiped a [[Zakharan pantheon|local god]] called [[Botu'Astok]].
