'''House Moonflower''' was the royal [[moon elven]] family of the island of [[Evermeet]].

==History==
[[Zaor Moonflower]] ([[572 DR]]) reigned from the {{YearlinkName|888}} and died on [[Ches 2]], the {{YearlinkName|1321}}. He was succeeded by his second wife and Queen, [[Amlaruil Moonflower]] ([[611 DR]]), who was known as the Sad Queen. The couple officially bore thirteen children: seven daughters and six boys. Zaor and Amlaruil were the parents of their oldest daughter Princess [[Ilyrana Moonflower|Ilyrana]], and twins Prince [[Zhoron Moonflower|Zhoron]] and [[Xharlion Moonflower|Xharlion]]. Afterwards, the two parents married. Next came Prince [[Chozzaster Moonflower|Chozzaster]], Princess [[Shandalar Moonflower|Shandalar]], and two more sets of twin girls, Princesses [[Tira'allara Moonflower|Tira'allara]] and [[Hhora Moonflower|Hhora]] and then Princesses [[Lazziar Moonflower|Lazziar]] and [[Gemstarzah Moonflower|Gemstarzah]]. Many years later, they had four more children, first Princess [[Amnestria Moonflower|Amnestria]], then Prince [[Zandro Moonflower|Zandro]], Prince [[Finufaranell Moonflower|Finufaranell]], and lastly Prince [[Lamruil Moonflower|Lamruil]] ([[1272 DR]]). Via Amnestria, the parents had two grandchildren, one was a secret son with former moon elven noble [[Elaith Craulnober]] (known by herself, Lamruil and her future love Bran) and the other was the half-elf [[Arilyn Moonblade]] with [[human]] [[ranger]] [[Bran Skorlsun]].

Eldest daughter Ilyrana was a priestess of [[Angharradh]]. eldest sons Zhoron and Xharlion trained as fighters as they were robust as their father. Chozzaster dedicated himself to magic and became a [[Elven high mage|High Mage]]. Shandalar chose the path of the [[bladesinger]]. Tira'allara and Hhora trained as priestesses of [[Hanali Celanil]]. Lazziar and Gemstarzah worked as diplomats to the mainland elves. Amnestria loved the life of the solitary adventurer, but was Zaor's favorite child. Zandro and Finufaranell were mages and studied in the [[Towers]]. Lamruil was a mischievous young man more human than most, followed Amnestria as an adventurer, but he favored gambling and wenching.

Either eldest Prince Zhoron or Xharlion was devoured by the [[Ityak-Ortheel|Elf-Eater]], and the other twin's fate is unknown; both may have met this end. Princesses Lazziar and Gemstarzah vanished during a diplomatic mission. Prince Chozzaster voluntarily died young to enter [[Arvandor]]. Princess Shandalar died during her [[bladesinger]] training. Princess Tira'allera entered into a disastrous relationship with a noble elf, and died of heartbreak; Princess Hhora married a chance-met commoner and disappeared into the [[High Forest]] of [[Faer√ªn]]. Eldest Princess Ilyrana later took the Elf-Eater to Arvandor in the hopes of defeating it, it was unknown if she ever returned. The youngest Princess [[Amnestria Moonflower|Amnestria]] was banished by the nobility to the mainland after bearing a half-elven child, her second child, but died during the late 1320s or early 1330s DR. The fates of wizards Prince Zandro and Prince Finufaranell were not told. Youngest Prince Lamruil, despite his early habits, successfully drew one the most powerful elven ''[[moonblade]]s'', known as the ''[[King's Blade]]'' after [[Kymil Nimesin]] fled Evermeet. Upon Amlaruil's return to Evermeet, the youngest prince left with [[Maura Silverhand]] at the Queen's private request to build a kingdom with the ''[[Tree of Souls]]'' in the distant north, later known as [[Auseriel]].

In [[1380 DR]], Lamruil left Auseriel with elven high mage [[Araevin Teshurr]] to search for his Princess Maura.

With the rise of the [[Spellplague]] after [[1385 DR]], Queen Amlaruil mysteriously disappeared, leading to Evermeet's council later creating the [[Evermeet#Royal Council|Royal Council]] by {{Yearlink|1479}}.

It was currently unknown of the surviving House Moonflower members by the end of the [[Second Sundering]].
