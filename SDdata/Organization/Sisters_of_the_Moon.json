        "mainbody": "The Sisters of the Moon was an adventuring company from the city of Kelazzan in Ulgarth, active in the late 15 century DR.\nLike most powerful individuals in the region â€“ members of The Sisters of the Moon were all females. The adventuring companies in the region were filled with dramatic schemes, plots, and feuds amongst the groups, and The Sisters of the Moon was no exception, feuding with the Ladies of Renown of Myrmyr.\nIn the late 15 century DR, The Sisters of the Moon sent their agents to the lands north and west from the Shining South in search of new magics to give them the upper hand against other adventuring bands. The Sisters traveled to Thay, Rashemen, Waterdeep, ruins of Myth Drannor, and Zhentil Keep, among other locations."
