The Sisters of the Merciful Mother were a religious order devoted to the goddess Hathor.
The members of this order were clergy of Hathor who took vows of pacifism.
They served in the cities of Mulhorand and had the supreme authority to intercede on the behalf of anyone in need, the injured and the sick, even slaves. Their actions in these matters could not be countermanded, even by a cleric of Horus-Re.
