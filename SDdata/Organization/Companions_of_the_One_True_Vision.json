        "mainbody": "The '''Companions of the One True Vision''' were a group of [[Helm]]ite [[cleric]]s and [[fighter]]s who had a disparate existence within the greater [[Church of Helm|church]]. While they had a reputation as unwavering loyal soldiers, a vanguard that could carry out tasks and complete objectives far beyond the ability of others, their actions earned them a reviled reputation around [[Faerûn]] that lingered for years.",
        "History": "Prior to the 1360s [[DR]], the Companions were renowned for their obedience and military prowess. This perspective changed however, At some point the Companions found themselves responsible for the slaughter of a number of the native people.\n\nReviled around Faerûn and ridden with guilt for their savage crimes, many Companions sought spiritual absolution by refocusing their dedication to Helm and his tenets. Many of these skilled warriors joined the meek but compassionate [[Vigilant Eyes of the God]]."
