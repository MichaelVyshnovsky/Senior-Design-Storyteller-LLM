The Khoroshen was a tribe of lizardfolk who inhabited the low marshes of the Evermoors.
In 1372 DR, First Speaker Tessarin Alaurin of the city of Nesm√© recruited the tribe to help defend the city against troll and giant attacks. 
The tribe was led by Uhndek, and most only spoke Draconic.
The Viperkin were a group of Khoroshen who carried shields adorned with a snake-like design, from which they derived their name.
