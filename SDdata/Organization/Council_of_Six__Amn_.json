        "mainbody": "The '''Council of Six''' was the mysterious, anonymous group of heads of the most influential merchant houses of [[Amn]] that ruled over the nation during most of the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Their goal was to keep money flowing through their country at all costs. The group ruled from the [[Council House]], a fortress-like [[Shoon]] structure within the [[Scepter District (Athkatla)|scepter district]] in the capital city of [[Athkatla]].\n\nWhile the council was never short of power, they often sought more control over the mercantile houses of Amn to maintain peace between the often-feuding clans. They sought to maintain the balance between the profits brought in when the houses operated in autonomy and regulating any conflicts that threatened to disrupt this prosperity.",
        "Rules": {
            "Anonymity": "The council's members chose to remain anonymous at their founding in [[1333 DR]]. This had the effect of shrouding the council in fear and mystery, but more importantly it protected them from assassination, bribery, and external manipulation. The maintenance of this deception was enforced by law; anyone who spoke or wrote about the identity of any councilors was punished by torture and death."

        "History": {
            "Founding": "The council was formed by [[Meisarch]] Thayze Selemchant, an intelligent and charismatic member of the [[Cowled Wizards]], in 1333 DR in direct response to the [[Great Trade War of Amn]]. Using his family connections in Athkatla, he used whatever persuasive techniques he could to convince the leaders of five other mercantile-houses and families to form a new government to, in his words, \"(rid our nation of) ''these ridiculous conflicts that waste our time, lives, and fortunes''\".\n\nTo get the Amnian populace to comply with this new government, Selemchant and his allies spread a series of rumors, accompanied with an appropriate amount of coin, throughout the country. These ranged from an incoming [[elven]] invasion, either from [[Shilmista]] or the [[Forest of Tethir]], to incoming naval attacks from the likes of pirates from the [[Nelanther Isles]] or even the navy of [[Waterdeep]]. While these were all completely baseless, the internal strife and blood feuds of the great trade war faded in intensity in the face of perceived external threats.\n\nFinally, in an attempt to mitigate the damage to trade caused by the rivalries between families, the councilors dropped their surnames as they took control as the new government of Amn. This anonymity helped the Amnian people to believe the promises that the new ruling body would act in the best interests of all the Amnian mercantile families, rather than a select few, as it was under the previous monarchy. Ultimately, the council was all-but-fully accepted by Amn, with any resistance falling to their mercenary forces.\n\nBy [[1338 DR]], the Council's control over all of Amn was complete and they were domestically secure. Money was rolling into the treasury coffers through taxes and tariffs, and the council had formed a compact with the [[Shadow Thieves]] to their mutual benefit. The council was protected by their activities while the [[thieves]] guild retained their power in the capital of Athkatla. Secure in their standing at home, the council moved to increase the nation's standing along the [[Sword Coast]], making moves both against, and aligned with, Waterdeep,",
            "Council Schism": "When the continent of [[Maztica]] was discovered by the [[Golden Legion]], several leading merchants from Athkatla and [[Murann]] were assassinated, while the Council of Six remained placid and refused to act. It wasn't until the seventh leader was killed that the council intervened and, in [[1362 DR]], restricted trade across the [[Trackless Sea]] to the continent. Only traders specifically approved, and licensed, by the council were allowed to operate there.  \n\nSoon after, the Namarch, [[Curkon Gheldieg]], revealed a plot by the Pommarch, [[Wulver Xornnag]], who had financed a personal fleet with the aim to dominate trade in [[New Amn]], leave the council, and reveal the identities of its members. When overwhelming evidence was brought to the council, the Pommarch denied it, after which new suspicions arose, implicating the Namarch. The council came to a detente over the accusations, which persisted until [[Marpenoth]] of that year when the bickering, mistrust, and several attempts at murder came to a head during a meeting where the Meisarch was stabbed and poisoned after incinerating a couple of his colleagues, along with scores of guards, with ''[[fireball]]s'' and other [[magic]].\n\nAfter the dust of battle had settled, only half the council remained alive: [[Phaan Colwyvv]], [[Qar Jysstev]], and the new Meisarch, [[Erlranther Alibakkar]]. Before they could begin to rebuild their governing body, they were approached by the [[Grandmaster (Shadow Thieves)|Grandmaster]] of the Shadow Thieves, [[Rhinnom Dannihyr]], who revealed his knowledge of all the identities of members of the council, details regarding their financial holdings, and his role as the informant who had provided the original tip of Xornnag's treachery. For all his maneuvering, as well as his discretion, Dannihyr was granted the seat as the new Iltarch and the Shadow Thieves fell into the fold as information agents of the council."
