        "mainbody": "The '''Errant Thoughts''' were, alongside the [[Minders]] and the [[Lore Filchers]], one of the military branches in charge of the defense of the [[illithid]] city of [[Oryndoll]] in the [[Darklands]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They were charged with directly defending the city's environs and were the division that would be dispatched by the [[Elder Concord]] to strike at foes of the city.",
        "Organization": "Like the two other branches of Oryndoll's defenders, the Errant Thoughts were led by an experienced illithid [[vigileator]] holding the office of High Vigileator and answering directly to the Elder Concord.\n\nConsidering their rather martial orientation, the Errant Thoughts were unsurprisingly closely associated with Oryndoll's [[Tamer Creed]].",
        "Activities": "The bulk of the Errant Thoughts' activities was to patrol the [[Underdark]] wilds surrounding the city for up to {{SI|20|mile|k|long=yes}} away. They were generally in groups consisting of one to three illithid vigileators leading a mixed group of twenty to thirty [[troglodyte]]s, [[Lizardfolk|lizardmen]], and [[tren]] thralls, with the common addition of either a couple of [[tzakandi]] or a trio of [[intellect devourer]]s, whose role was to detect and neutralize any [[spellcaster]] or [[psion]] encountered.\n\nIn times of trouble, the size of those patrols could be bolstered to twice or thrice their standard numbers."
