{{quote|&hellip;seeking out those in need of the Triad&rsquo;s touch&hellip;}}
'''The Janessar''' were a group of warriors and priests throughout [[Calimshan]], all worshiping [[The Triad]] ([[Torm]], [[Tyr]], and [[Ilmater]]), who opposed the slave trade and protected travelers from bandits.<ref name=EotSS-p176/>

==Organization==
The Janessar were active in loose collections of small groups of between four and twelve. These groups always included skilled warriors and riders[[Fighter|&mdash;fighters]], [[Cleric|priests]], and [[Crusader|crusaders]]. The Janessar included a good number of escaped slaves who continued the cause that freed them. Because they did not gather together in large numbers outside of their enclaves, their total numbers were hard to estimate.<ref name=EotSS-p176/>

Janessar enclaves were controlled by a captain or lord who was often a cleric of one of the members of the Triad.<ref name=EotSS-pp83-84>

In [[1370 DR]], the Janessar as a whole were led by three elderly priests who no longer rode nor fought, each worshiping a different member of the Triad:<ref name=EotSS-p176/>
* Holy Justice [[Kadar al Haerim]], [[paladin]] of Tyr
* Brother [[Kalil the Painbearer]], paladin of Ilmater
* Vanguard [[Shellidar]], [[crusader]] of Torm
These three men remained hidden in the Tower of the Three in the [[Khanall]] enclave.<ref name=EotSS-p176/>

==Activities==
In general, the Janessar sought for the betterment of the common folk of Calimshan.<ref name=FRCS-p156> This most often involved the rescuing of travelers from bandits and the freeing or protection of slaves. Under threat of violence, they would often ride into Calishite plantations and demand that owners better treat their slaves, and they would attack slave caravans, freeing those held captive.<ref name=EotSS-p176/>

==Tactics==
As many of the Janessar were trained warriors, they used sound military tactics. This, together with the use of [[Enchantment|memory-altering magic]], prevented their hideouts from being discovered by their enemies.<ref name=EotSS-pp83-84/>

==Enclaves==
The Janessar maintained many military bases in the [[Marching Mountains]].<ref name=FRCS-p156/> The three largest strongholds were [[Faeressar]], [[Khanall]], and [[Rutawwa]]. They also had hideouts in a secret cavern complex northeast of [[Almraiven]] in the [[Alimir Mountains|Alimirs]] and in [[Suldolphor]], [[Memnon]], and [[Yhep]].<ref name=EotSS-p176/> Each enclave was a self-sufficient and defended military stronghold.<ref name=EotSS-pp83-84/>

==Relationships==
Naturally, the [[Ralan el Persakhal|syl-pasha]] and his government hated the Janessar and sought to destroy them, seeking aid from the government of [[Tethyr]] in the matter, but the [[Zaranda Star|queen of Tethyr]] refused to actively work against the group.<ref name=EotSS-p176/>

Within Tethyr, the Janessar had ties with the Triad temple [[Barakmordin]] and the leaders of the border forts [[Fort Agis|Agis]], [[Fort Tufenk|Tufenk]], and [[Fort Calim|Calim]] and the [[Iltakar Garrison]].<ref name=EotSS-p176/>

==History==
The order was founded in the [[1242 DR|Year of the Yellow Rose (1242 DR)]], which inspired the order's symbol: "''a yellow rose entwined around Torm's holy symbol''".<ref name=EotSS-p176/>
