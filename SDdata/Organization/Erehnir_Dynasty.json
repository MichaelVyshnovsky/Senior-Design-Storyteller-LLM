        "orgname": "the Erehnir Dynasty",
        "mainbody": "The '''Erehnir Dynasty''' was the third of six dynasties of the [[Second Age of Calimshan]].",
        "Organization": "The leaders of the Erehnir Dynasty were [[bakkal]]s, or high [[priest]]s, of their people, like the in the dynasties before them.",
        "Base of Operations": "The bakkal's palace was located in the city of [[Calimport]].",
        "Activities": "Beginning in {{Yearlink|-2375}}, the Erehnirs reestablished the worship of [[genie]]s in [[Calimshan]] and revered those elemental beings exclusively, even though genies were incapable of granting [[divine magic]]. (Enough time had passed since the [[Calim Empire]] and the enslavement of the [[Calishite]] people for the oppression of the genies to have been forgotten.)\n\nCorrespondingly, the architecture, fashion, and fine arts of the day began to reflect this worship in the inclusion of genie imagery, and this dynasty—along with the [[Vahlen Dynasty]] that succeeded it—is remembered for its support of the arts and for its construction of many monuments and temples. Together, the Erehnir and Vahlen dynasties built over 200 temples and shrines. Many such temples were for the worship of genies, and many of these were located in the [[Calim Desert]] near some of the battles between [[human]]s and genies long ago. It was believed that being at such sites would increase the chances of their prayers being heard. Many of the monuments of the Erehnir Dynasty survived well into the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], though the majority of them were buried under the desert sands.\n\nThe most famous of the monuments still surviving was perhaps the [[Eight Erehnirs]] in the city of [[Volothamp]]. The Eight Erehnirs were eight carvings in the cliff walls of ''one'' of the Erehnir bakkals, [[Pasha]] [[Nakkar el Erehnir IV|Nakkar IV]]. Each carving was a different representation of the dynastic ruler.",
        "Notable Members": "* Pasha [[Nakkar el Erehnir IV]], the fifth bakkal of the dynasty, whose image was memorialized in the Eight Erehnirs.",
        "History": "The Erehnirs came to power in {{Yearlink|-2381}}, the same year that three [[beholder]] [[spelljammer|colony ships]] crashed into the [[Alimir Mountains]]. After the beholders had been defeated, the last bakkal of the currently ruling [[Tavihr Dynasty]] held a victory celebration. During this celebration, the bakkal and his twelve heirs were all simultaneously assassinated, when the entire palace was set ablaze by the assassins. The first Erehnir ruler then took the throne.\n\nAround the year {{Yearlink|-2280}}, a decade-long period of rebuilding began in the city of Calimport, known as the Erehnir Restoration. During this period, many areas of the city destroyed by guild wars were rebuilt with artistic and religious flair, including murals upon the walls in two of Calimport's western neighborhoods that were still visible by the 14{{th}} century.\n\nThe dynasty ended in {{Yearlink|-2100}}, when the Vahlen Dynasty came to power.",
        "Trivia": "[[Erehnir Sabban]] in [[Faiths Ward]] of Calimport was named for this dynasty and included many statues embedded in the brick ''[[sabban]]'' walls, which were carved in {{Yearlink|911}} in honor of the Erehnir bakkals."
