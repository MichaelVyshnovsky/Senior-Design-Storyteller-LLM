The '''Knights of Holy Judgment''' were an order of [[paladin]]s that faithfully focused on the lawful tenets of their patron deity [[Tyr]].

==Activities==
The Knights were very close to the [[Knights of the Merciful Sword]], both of whose members were the only faithful of Tyr who were eligible to join the ranks of the [[Hammers of Grimjaws]].

Much of their energy was devoted to hunting criminals and monsters in order to bring them to justice. In fact, they specialized in the hunting of [[devil]]s.

Some of the elite members of the Knights of Holy Judgment might receive an invitation to join the [[Hammers of Grimjaws]].
