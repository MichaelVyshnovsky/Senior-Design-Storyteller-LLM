House Eselemas was a tribe of yuan-ti known for their stealth and skill in battle. Yuan-ti from this house were called Eselemaa.
Nine Eselemaa ruled Lushpool during the late 14 century DR. These satraps held a majority over Lushpools sixteen satrapies.
The majority of Eselemaa lived along the shores of the Lapal Sea and the northeastern region of the Mhair Jungles, with settlements forming a "hidden serpent" all the way to Lushpool.
House Eselemas was the sworn enemy of House SeSehen, a feud stemming from rival claims to certain areas of the jungles surrounding the Lapal Sea. The Eselemaa allied themselves with House Jennestas, often fighting together against the SeSehen. The Coiled Cabal remained on good terms with the Eselemaa because of Lushpools port access to Tharsult.
