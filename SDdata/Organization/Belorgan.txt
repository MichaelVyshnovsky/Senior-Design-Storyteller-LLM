Belorgan was a noble house of Cormyr.
The family head was the Earl of Wyvernshores, who owned the farmland along the southeastern coast of the Wyvernwater. The Belorgan estates were called Mossfarms. The courtesy titles of Baron of Lowbridge (a village) and Baron of Mossfarms (the Belorgan estates) were unused but held by Harlo in case he had additional children.
Windkeep and Fallturret were the names of the two castles owned by the Belorgans. The titles Baron of Windkeep and Baron of Fallturret were additional titles held in reserve by the Belorgans, after the two Belorgan castles.
