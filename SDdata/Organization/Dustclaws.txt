The Dustclaws were a Luskan gang lead by a half-orc named Duulgrin. The gangs symbol was a dripping claw inside a circle.
In 1480 DR, the gang had sixty members and operated out of a tavern. The gangs leader was killed by Sithe during Kalen Drens attempt to clean up the city. After Duulgrins death, the gang chose Sithe as their leader and she lead the gang for a brief time.
