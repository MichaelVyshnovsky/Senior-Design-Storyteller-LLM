The '''Astorians''' were the dominant [[thieves' guild]] in the city of [[Teziir]] as of [[1359 DR]]. 

==Activities==
Their primary activities revolved around petty theft protection services, with goods often being offered as "tithes." The [[Council of Teziir]] wished to diminish the Astorians' influence within the city, but they simply could not afford the services required to do so effectively.

==Members==
The Astorians numbered nearly 700 members in 1359 DR and they were growing rapidly. Many believed the Astorians would end up ruling Teziir within a generation or two.
