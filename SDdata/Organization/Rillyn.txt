'''Rillyn''' was one of the  numerous noble families that composed the [[nobility of Baldur's Gate|patriar]] of [[Baldur's Gate]]. While they were considered among the most upstanding, if not particularly interesting families of the Baldurian nobility, The misguided actions taken by one over-ambitious family member led to near-complete financial ruin and disgrace of the Rillyn family name during the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

For most of their history the Rillyns had a reputation for being keen investors, as well as rather rather dull and uninteresting individuals. While they maintained their honor among the nobility, they were known to employ agents of [[the Guild]] to collect from their debtors.

After losing much of their status and wealth,

==Base of Operations==
The family's city estate known as [[Rillyn House]] had been partially transformed into Rillyn School, an institution that specialized in the training of would-be soldiers, mercenaries and other martial combatants.

==Relationships==
Some members of the family held loose ties with the Baldurian criminal syndicate known as [[the Guild]].

While the ''wish'' spell worked in removing the curse, Machil was slain by agents of a powerful [[Queen of Air and Darkness|archfey regent]].

Seeing her family without a reliable source of income, Yvandre Rillyn converted her family's manor house to a martial combat academy, founding the Rillyn School in the {{YearlinkName|1487}}.
