House Ambershield was a noble family of Cormyr.
In the late 15th Century, the members of House Ambershield were known to be steadfast and adamant - resisting reforms by King Foril Obarskyr I and attempts to corrupt them alike.
Helindra Crownsilver held a dim view of the Ambershields, once remarking that she is unlike them, and so would not turn a sick guest out of their tallhouse.
Ambershields Hall in Suzail served as the domicile of the head of the house in the late 15th Century.
The entrance to the Hall was bedecked by average heighted stone and copper doors that shone brightly under light. To the side, stood sculpted winged lions under a wide, raised stone porch.
