        "mainbody": "The '''Iron Maidens''' were an all-female [[adventuring company]] in [[Faer√ªn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/55/The New Rogues Gallery: Iron Maidens|19-20}}",
        "Activities": "The Iron Maidens were willing to take up almost any job asked of them. This included exploring, [[map]]ping, scouting, retrieving lost objects, rescuing people, slaying monsters, and plotting ambushes or raids. However, they charged a high fee of 8,000 [[gold piece]]s, charging twice or thrice that much for dangerous missions.",
        "Base of Operations": "This adventuring company was based in an [[Iron Maidens castle|old castle]] in the [[Thunder Peaks]] that they had found abandoned and decided to restore with their wealth.",
        "History": "The Iron Maidens were formed by the adventurer [[Kiera]], after contacting six women she had previously worked with in various different adventuring companies. Among these women was a [[thief]] by the name of [[Lyrissa]]. Over time they became enemies of [[Fzoul Chembryl]].\n\nOne day a rich merchant hired the Iron Maidens for a mission, which turned out to be a set-up orchestrated by agents of Fzoul. All but two were killed in the process, with Kiera and Lyrissa escaping the trap with a valuable necklace from Fzoul's treasury. Later they exacted revenge upon the merchant, with Kiera killing him, and they recruited a new member in the form of [[Tiralia]].",
        "Relationships": "Fzoul Chembryl had a bounty of 1,000 gold pieces out for live retrieval of any members of the Iron Maidens, except for Lyrissa, whom he had a bounty of 3,000 gold pieces on for having stolen the necklace from his treasury."
