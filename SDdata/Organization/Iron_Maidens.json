        "mainbody": "he Iron Maidens were an all-female adventuring company in Faer√ªn in the 14 century DR.\nThe Iron Maidens were willing to take up almost any job asked of them. This included exploring, mapping, scouting, retrieving lost objects, rescuing people, slaying monsters, and plotting ambushes or raids. However, they charged a high fee of 8,000 gold pieces, charging twice or thrice that much for dangerous missions.\nThis adventuring company was based in an old castle in the Thunder Peaks that they had found abandoned and decided to restore with their wealth.\nThe Iron Maidens were formed by the adventurer Kiera, after contacting six women she had previously worked with in various different adventuring companies. Among these women was a thief by the name of Lyrissa. Over time they became enemies of Fzoul Chembryl.\nOne day a rich merchant hired the Iron Maidens for a mission, which turned out to be a set-up orchestrated by agents of Fzoul. All but two were killed in the process, with Kiera and Lyrissa escaping the trap with a valuable necklace from Fzouls treasury. Later they exacted revenge upon the merchant, with Kiera killing him, and they recruited a new member in the form of Tiralia.\nFzoul Chembryl had a bounty of 1,000 gold pieces out for live retrieval of any members of the Iron Maidens, except for Lyrissa, whom he had a bounty of 3,000 gold pieces on for having stolen the necklace from his treasury."
