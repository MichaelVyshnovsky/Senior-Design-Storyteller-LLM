        "History": "The history of the council dates back to the earliest days of Baldur's Gate and the conflict between the rich farmers of the walled city and the sea-captains of the harbor who refused to pay for entering the gate that had been financed by their colleague [[Balduran]]. The captains overthrew the farmers and the four eldest among them were installed as rulers, jokingly calling themselves \"dukes\".\n\nIn the mid–15{{th}} century DR, Grand Duke [[Valarken]] tried to seize power using [[lycanthrope]] mercenaries, but failed. After that, surviving Duke [[Dillard Portyr]] dissolved the council, which was replaced by the [[Parliament of Peers|Baldurian Parliament]] for some time.\n\nIn [[1492 DR]], the Council of Four and the Parliament of Peers were dissolved after [[Enver Gortash|Lord Enver Gortash]] was named the first archduke of Baldur's Gate following a vote in the High Hall by the peers."
