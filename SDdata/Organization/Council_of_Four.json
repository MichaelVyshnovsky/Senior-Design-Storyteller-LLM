        "mainbody": "The Council of Four, whose individual members were referred to as the Dukes in the mid–14 and 15th century DR,\nIn the 15 century, Baldurs Gate was governed by the Council of Four, which consisted of dukes and was the highest governing body that decided on law and politics. One of the dukes, the Grand Duke, had the power to break deadlocks in the Council. Below them was the Parliament of Peers, which discussed future actions and made recommendations to the dukes on all matters.\nOne of the dukes is traditionally the highest ranking officer of the Flaming Fist.\nThe history of the council dates back to the earliest days of Baldurs Gate and the conflict between the rich farmers of the walled city and the sea-captains of the harbor who refused to pay for entering the gate that had been financed by their colleague Balduran. The captains overthrew the farmers and the four eldest among them were installed as rulers, jokingly calling themselves \"dukes\".\nIn the mid–15 century DR, Grand Duke Valarken tried to seize power using lycanthrope mercenaries, but failed. After that, surviving Duke Dillard Portyr dissolved the council, which was replaced by the Baldurian Parliament for some time.\nIn 1492 DR, the Council of Four and the Parliament of Peers were dissolved after Lord Enver Gortash was named the first archduke of Baldurs Gate following a vote in the High Hall by the peers. \n1357 DR\n(all known as Grand Dukes and Duchesses)\n*Belt, a powerful warrior and famed adventurer\n*Eltan, the founder of the Baldurian Flaming Fist\n*Liia Jannath, a skilled mage and\n*Entar Silvershield, the richest citizen of the city.\n1479 DR\n*Abdel Adrian, the famed adventurer and celebrated hero of the city\n*Torlin Silvershield, the wealthy and powerful cleric of Gond\n*Grand Duke Dillard Portyr, an elder businessman who was rather easily influenced and\n*Belynne Stelmane, a formidable politician who was possessed by a mind flayer.\n1492 DR\n*Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard, a career officer within the Flaming Fist\n*Thalamra Vanthampur, a cunning patriar who built her familys wealth and lifted herself out of poverty\n*Dillard Portyr, the former Grand Duke before he ceded it to Ravengard and\n*Belynne Stelmane."
