        "Relationships": "In the early years of their history, the order was sponsored by the [[Church of Kossuth]].",
        "History": "The order originally comprised disciples of [[Kossuth]].\n\nIn the years after the {{YearlinkName|1385}}, the order went silent. There was speculation however, that small sects were operating out of [[Amruthar]] in [[Lapendrar]].\n\nAfter the Spellplague, the [[Fire Knives]] were known to train new recruits in the ways of the original Black Flame Zealots, barring their initial strict worship of Kossuth. Assassin's guilds across [[Toril]] began to harbor Black Flame Zealots disconnected from the worship of Kossuth.{{Cite dragon/401/Class Acts: Assassin: Black Flame Zealot|20}}"
