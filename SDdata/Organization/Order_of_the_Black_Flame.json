        "mainbody": "The Order of the Black Flame, whose members were called Black Flame zealots, was a secret society of assassins that operated in the realm of Thay.\nZealots of the Black Flame were taught the rites associated with the Kossuthan faith. They often acted against those whose actions were an affront to the Firelord.\nThey served as the eyes, ears, and hands of Kossuth in Thay. In fact they were legally allowed to act of behalf of Thayan noble families. Even the mighty zulkirs were not safe from their reach.\nAssassins of the Black Flame were immune to fear, both magical and emotional in nature. They were skilled in the use of certain poisons.\nZealots of a certain skill level were capable of lesser means of teleportation.\nThey utilized their namesake black flame either bestowed upon their weapons, or as a conflagration that consumed those they killed. Individuals that died in this manner could only be resurrected by powerful arcane magic or a miracle.\nIn the early years of their history, the order was sponsored by the Church of Kossuth.\nThe order originally comprised disciples of Kossuth.\nIn the years after the , the order went silent. There was speculation however, that small sects were operating out of Amruthar in Lapendrar.\nAfter the Spellplague, the Fire Knives were known to train new recruits in the ways of the original Black Flame Zealots, barring their initial strict worship of Kossuth. Assassins guilds across Toril began to harbor Black Flame Zealots disconnected from the worship of Kossuth."
