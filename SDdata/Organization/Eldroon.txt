Eldroon was a minor noble house of Cormyr.
They were a minor noble family of Marsember while it was an independent city.
The Eldroons encouraged the Marliirs to fight against Cormyr, then switched sides when King Dhalmass attacked in 1227 DR. Rhodes Marliir suspected the Eldroons of even guiding the Cormyreans through the marshes outside Marsember and to the city gates. They later celebrated Marsembers incorporation into the kingdom of Cormyr.
