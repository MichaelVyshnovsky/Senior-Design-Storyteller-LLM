        "mainbody": "The crystalline warriors were a group of five powerful constructs made from crystal and purposed with defending the realm of Tabot against invasion.\nWhen the soldiers of Shou Lung invaded and seized the whole of northern Tabot in , with the fate of the nation hanging in the balance, artisans in the town of Ji fashioned the five crystalline warriors and a group of great dang-ki and wu jen animated them and gave them life and magical abilities. On the third day of the fifth month, the ragged defenders of Tabot and their five crystalline warriors confronted the Shou Lung army as they marched out of Lokar Pass. Though the battle was terrific, they were victorious, and went on to reclaim all of the conquered lands. The date of the battle would be considered holy and celebrated as Crystal Day.\nAfterward, the crystalline warriors went into the mountains to await the day when Tabot again had need of them. While they would awaken if Tabot was being invaded and devastated, they ignored genuine pleas for aid in lesser crises.\nThey waited within a sepulcher hidden deep under a mountain somewhere in Tabot. They could only be roused by a lama of great faith, but also by those who happened to disturb them.\nEach of the crystalline warriors could fly, turn invisible, and jump with great skill. Moreover, being artificial beings, they were immune to poisons and petrification and to charm, hold, death, and sleep spells. In addition, the individual crystalline warriors had their own unique powers\n* The Glass Warrior could turn water to ice. It was armed with a +3 bow and a quiver that never ran out of arrows.\n* The Porcelain Warrior could cause water to boil. It was armed with a copper +2 lance and a +2 shield that shone as brightly as the sun and could blind those who beheld it.\n* The Ruby Warrior could turn water to steam and ignite cloth and wood. It was armed with a massive stone +4 club, which itself spoke in a whisper to the possessor and bestowed powers of true sight and scrying.\n* The Jade Warrior could turn water into plants and even herd trees. It was armed with a magical bamboo scimitar, similar to a +5 sword of sharpness, which could cause wood rot.\n* The Diamond or Rainbow Warrior could control weather and the elements of earth and water (similar to the corresponding wu jen elemental spells). It was armed with the legendary \"Scythe of Pain\", a +5 weapon that inflicted excruciating pain, enough to incapacitate a victim for up to three minutes.\nThe crystalline warriors were valued at 50,000 gp each, except the diamond warrior, which was 70,000 gp."
