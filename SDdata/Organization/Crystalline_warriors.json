        "mainbody": "The '''crystalline warriors''' were a group of five powerful [[construct]]s made from crystal and purposed with defending the realm of [[Tabot]] against invasion.",
        "History": "When the soldiers of [[Shou Lung]] invaded and seized the whole of northern Tabot in {{YearlinkConvert|894|SY}}, with the fate of the nation hanging in the balance, artisans in the town of [[Ji]] fashioned the five crystalline warriors and a group of great dang-ki and wu jen animated them and gave them life and magical abilities. On the third day of the fifth month, the ragged defenders of Tabot and their five crystalline warriors confronted the Shou Lung army as they marched out of [[Lokar Pass]]. Though the battle was terrific, they were victorious, and went on to reclaim all of the conquered lands. The date of the battle would be considered holy and celebrated as [[Crystal Day]].\n\nAfterward, the crystalline warriors went into the mountains to await the day when Tabot again had need of them. While they would awaken if Tabot was being invaded and devastated, they ignored genuine pleas for aid in lesser crises.",
        "Lair": "They waited within a sepulcher hidden deep under a mountain somewhere in Tabot. They could only be roused by a [[lama]] of great faith, but also by those who happened to disturb them.",
        "Abilities": "Each of the crystalline warriors could [[fly]], turn [[Invisibility|invisible]], and [[jump]] with great skill. Moreover, being artificial beings, they were immune to [[poison]]s and [[petrification]] and to [[charm]], [[hold monster|hold]], [[:Category:Death_spells|death]], and [[sleep]] [[spell]]s. In addition, the individual crystalline warriors had their own unique powers:\n* The Glass Warrior could turn water to ice. It was armed with a ''+3 [[bow]]'' and a [[quiver of plenty|quiver that never ran out of arrows]].\n* The Porcelain Warrior could cause water to boil. It was armed with a [[copper]] ''+2 [[lance]]'' and a ''+2 [[shield]]'' that shone as brightly as the [[sun]] and could [[blindness|blind]] those who beheld it.\n* The [[Ruby]] Warrior could turn water to steam and ignite cloth and wood. It was armed with a massive stone ''+4 [[club]]'', which itself spoke in a whisper to the possessor and bestowed powers of [[true sight]] and [[Scry (spell)|scrying]].\n* The [[Jade]] Warrior could turn water into plants and even herd [[tree]]s. It was armed with a magical [[bamboo]] [[scimitar]], similar to a ''+5 [[sword of sharpness]]'', which could cause [[wood rot]].\n* The [[Diamond]] or Rainbow Warrior could control weather and the elements of [[Earth (element)|earth]] and [[water]] (similar to the corresponding wu jen elemental spells). It was armed with the legendary \"Scythe of Pain\", a ''+5 weapon'' that inflicted excruciating pain, enough to incapacitate a victim for up to three minutes.\n\nThe crystalline warriors were valued at 50,000 [[gp]] each, except the diamond warrior, which was 70,000 gp."
