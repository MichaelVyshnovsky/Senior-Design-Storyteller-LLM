        "mainbody": "The '''Annals of Halgren''' was an adventuring group assembled by [[Halgren Death's Head]], a member of the [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[Bruenghor Clan]], active ''circa'' [[1310 DR]].",
        "History": "The Annals of Halgren was established ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1300}}, by Halgren Death's Head and his wife, [[Alia Shield-Maiden]]. The couple of [[shield dwarves]] started their adventuring career in the [[Sunset Mountains]], Bruenghor Clan's home. Halgren's family was haunted by alledged tainted blood. One of his ancestors was a [[duergar]] criminal named [[Kaervas]], and in attempts to wipe foul reputation from his family name, Halgren Death's Head set out to earn gold and treasures. For a decade, Halgren and Alia traveled together until the {{YearlinkName|1310}}, when they gathered a band of mercenaries in [[Luskan]], eager to earn gold and fame.\n\nThe first recruit was a [[human]] [[ranger]] named [[Bastinado]], who's traveled the Realms and wore many hats. With time, he became the group's heart, keeping their spirits high. [[Amnian]] [[monk]] [[Silence-Before-Iron]] was the second to join the group. The air of mystery surrounded the woman. Her [[lower planes]] parentage and monastic tradition were kept secret by her vow of silence. [[Mordakai of Thay]] was once a member of the [[Red Wizards]] but abandoned them after his [[sorcerous]] gifts became public. Lastly, [[Kei the Wooden Idol]], a spirited [[half-elf]] rogue, joined the group. Her claims of being an actual wooden idol brought to life raised many eyebrows."
