The Pegasus Archery Company was a mercenary band based in the High Dale of the Dalelands in the 1360s DR.
The Company was based out of the stronghold of Arrowpoint. It stood on the rising ground a short distance northeast of Highcastle, facing the castle from across the pass.
The Pegasus Archery Company was only accepted into the High Dale on the condition that every member accept a spell cast on them by Yandrin Thorl. It would turn to stone any member who took up arms against Dale or attempted to rule in the High Dale.
The Pegasus Archery Company fought in the Sessrendale War of the Year of the Weeping Wives, 1232 DR, on the side of Archendale.
Some time in the late 1360s, High Constable Irreph Mulmar complemented their forces in the defense of High Dale with a squadron known as the Flying Auxiliary. These mounted archers did indeed ride pegasi into battle and fought alongside the mercenaries.
In 1367 DR, a large number of the Pegasus Archers were hired out by Cormyr to suppress a group of raiders in the Stonelands.
The Company was composed of 75 horse archers, women and men, mounted on light horses, not pegasi, and wielding short composite bows. Basic sellswords were paid 4 cp for a day of service while experienced fighters, often serving as sergeants, could earn as much as 5 sp a day.
