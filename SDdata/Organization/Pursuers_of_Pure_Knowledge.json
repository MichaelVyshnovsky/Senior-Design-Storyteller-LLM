        "mainbody": "The Pursuers of Pure Knowledge was a religious order devoted to Oghma, Lord of Knowledge, based in Mintar in the Lake of Steam region in the mid-to-late 14 century DR.\nIn the winter of the , Teldorn Darkhope conquered the city of Mintar at the head of a Zhentarim-sponsored army of the church of Iyachtu Xvim acting in the name of Bane. They looted and razed all the temples, then set about hunting down, assaulting, and even burning at the stake all those who opposed them, especially the priests. Nevertheless, many of Mintars priests survived, with some escaping the city and helping refugees get to safety, and others remaining within to do what they could to aid the people. The Pursuers carried out of their temple as many books, scrolls, maps, and records as possible, and hid these in caches throughout Mintar and below ground.\nThe Pursuers of Pure Knowledge were the most notable of those who opposed the rule of Darkhope. Those who stayed inside the city had two goals. One record all that occurred in the occupied city so that the Banites could one day be held accountable for their crimes and atrocities. Two obstruct and sabotage them in any way they could. As a result, the priests formed the core of the resistance, even being nicknamed the Pursuers of Freedom.\nWith the schism in the Church of Oghma after the Time of Troubles and the disappearance of Cullen Kordamant, the Pursuers sided with the Oghmanyte Church of Sembia against the Orthodox Church of Oghma by 1370 DR. They adopted the Sembians stance on the Churchs hierarchy, namely that a new Grand Patriarch had in fact already been appointed by Oghma himself, specifically, the Sembians own Undryl Yannathar. The Pursuers also adopted their titles. However, they disagreed on points of theology.\nThe priests used the following titles, in order from lowest to highest Advocate, Accomplished Advocate, Loremaster of the Twelfth, Loremaster of the Eleventh, and through to Loremaster of the Second, followed by Loremaster First, Loremaster High, Learned One, and Patriarch.\nThey were led by Loremistress Cindric Alaekyn."
