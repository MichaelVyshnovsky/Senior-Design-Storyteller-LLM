The Shadows of the Night was a wicked organization of skulks who served Ibrandul, the Lord of the Dry Depths.
The group was active within the region of the Underdark beneath Calimshan.
The skulks of the Shadows of the Night raided the surface world regularly if they knew they had superior numbers compared to their prey.
The group was believed to be lead by a powerful creature such as a renegade drow or an alhoon.
