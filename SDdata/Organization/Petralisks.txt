The '''Petralisks''', or the '''Gazers''', was a military organization within the [[Sevenfold Mazework]] of the [[Great Dismal Delve]].
 
==Organization==
1,500 dao cavalry using [[basilisk|greater basilisks]] for mounts made up the Petralisks.

==Activities==
This unit was poorly trained but maintained high morale, perhaps because of the devastating power their mounts had over most corporeal enemies.

They were slow to react and maneuver against enemies made from earth and stone.

==Base of Operations==
The Sevenfold Mazework within the Great Dismal Delve served as base of all dao military organizations.
