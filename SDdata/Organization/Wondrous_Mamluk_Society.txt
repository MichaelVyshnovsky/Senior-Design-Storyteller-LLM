The Wondrous Mamluk Society, also known as the Wondrous, was a military organization in Zakhara.
This wealthy group of mamluks served the Padishah of Afyal. Since the padishah did not want to risk these troops unnecessarily, they were typically used as palace guards or bodyguards during parades.
The Wondrous were led by Akima Abd al-Garib.
The Wondrous were based on the island of Afyal.
