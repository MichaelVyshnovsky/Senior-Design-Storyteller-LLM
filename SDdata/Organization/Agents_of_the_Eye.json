        "History": "The Agents of the Eye was a slaving ring created by [[Xanathar|The Eye]] after his arrival in Skullport in [[1205 DR]]. In time, his business and his organization grew. At one point, he re-formed his organization into a semi-autonomous model and retreated into the background, spreading rumors about his demise or retirement. Soon, most people forgot about the beholder slaver and, in [[1304 DR]], the Agents of the Eye were simply a large slaving ring in Skullport with no association with beholders.\n\nAt one point before [[1370 DR]], the Eye managed to slay and replace [[Xanathar]], leader of the [[Xanathar Thieves' Guild]], and so he merged the two organizations, his slaving ring and the thieves guild of Xanathar.",
        "Relationships": "The organization was actively trying to run [[Halaster's Heirs]], the arcane academy, out of the [[Dungeon Level]] of [[Undermountain]].",
