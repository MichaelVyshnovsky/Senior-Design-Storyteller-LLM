        "mainbody": "The '''Waterclock Guild''' was an occult [[guild]] of [[artisan]]s, [[geomancer]]s, and [[artificer]]s in [[Neverwinter]] famed for producing [[water clock]]s&mdash;[[magic]]al and nonmagical&mdash;that were both accurate and beautiful.",
        "Activities": "The guild members were masters of [[conjuration]], [[metallurgy]], and of [[mechanical engineering]], and so were capable of making immense timepieces powered by water.\n\nThey took great pride in the accuracy of their clocks, especially in regard to consistency across multiple clocks. They were known to make use of obscure jargon and rituals.",
        "Base of Operations": "The entrance to the guild's hall was a deadly trap. When unwanted adventurers entered the hall, the doors locked behind them, the giant clock on the wall started ticking, as the water filled the room.",
        "History": "The Waterclock Guild was founded in the 13{{th}} century [[DR]] by the [[wizard]] [[Lucan Greenharrow]] and the [[clockmaker]] [[Saborn Rendel]]. Using the former's [[magic]] and the latter's clockmaking skill, the guild made beautiful and precise water clocks\n\nLucan's true purpose for founding the Guild was to pursue knowledge he had gained during his time at the [[Hosttower of the Arcane]] in [[Luskan]], having discovered tendrils of magic connecting the sea toward [[Gauntlgrym|somewhere southeast of that city]].\n\nAt some point, certain high ranking members of the Waterclock Guild came to be affiliated with the [[Cult of the Dragon]].\n\nThe Guild collapsed sometime following the [[Spellplague]], although some of its artisans survived and eventually escape Neverwinter as [[Ruining|refugees]]. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, some longer-lived surviving members (namely [[dwarves]] and [[gnome]]s) began returning to Neverwinter to seek old water clocks of the Guild in hopes of rediscovering lost construction techniques. They also hoped to once again make use of the Waterclock Guild's Crypts to bury master water clock makers who had been denied that honor.",
        "Members": "Notable members included the founders (Lucan Greenharrow and Saborn Rendel) as well as [[Romani Monini]], a high-ranking member of the Cult of the Dragon, and [[Enki the Carver]], author of ''[[The Clockmaker's Lament]]''."
