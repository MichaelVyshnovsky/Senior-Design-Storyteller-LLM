        "History": "The Warlock Knights were founded sometime shortly after the [[Spellplague]] when Telos fell from the sky and crashed into the Vasaan tundra. The primordial was discovered by the one who would go on to be called the Voice of Telos, and it was quickly determined that ''ironfell'' could be harvested from the body and used to enhance magical and martial abilities. \n\nUsing the power of Telos, the Warlock Knights waited for the right time to seize control of Vaasa from the [[Bloodstone Lands#The Kingdom of Bloodstone|Kingdom of Bloodstone]]. They began subjugating small populations of peasants and humanoids, including wiping out out a settlement of [[minotaurs]] at [[Kond]] in [[1453 DR]] to secure the site for themselves. In [[1459 DR]], they took advantage of civil unrest in Bloodstone to conscript and marshal an army, and began a war of conquest across Vaasa in the {{YearlinkName|1460}}. Ultimately, they burned down the former capital at [[Bloodstone City]] in the {{YearlinkName|1469}}, and declared their independence from the Kingdom of Bloodstone.{{BloodstoneCityRazing}}\n\nIn [[1470 DR]], the Knights would also attempt to conquer the [[dwarf|dwarves]] of the Galena Mountains, ultimately expelling them from [[Bloodstone Mines]] and driving [[Hillsafar Hall]] to seal its gates.\n\nUnder the Warlock Knights, Vaasa was restructured as a brutal feudal society with its capital at [[Telos City]], which had been built on top of the sleeping primordial. The source and true nature of the Warlock Knights' power was kept a secret, and was obfuscated with an almost religious-like veneration of Telos that prohibited the worship of any gods with the exception of Bane.\n\nBeginning in the 1470s DR, the Warlock Knights engaged in secret efforts to undermine the [[Moonsea]] region and the tribes of [[The Ride]] with the goal of expanding their influence.\n\nAround this same time, the secret Banite faction within the Knights made overtures to form an alliance with the Banites in the [[Council of Blades]] in [[Mulmaster]], and sought to keep these efforts secret from the Ironfell Council even as their delegates began to arrive in Vaasa.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Tyranny's Bleak Depths|5}}\n\nBy [[1480 DR]], the Knights were the masters of Vaasa south of the [[Lugsaas Chain]] mountains, and were eyeing opportunities for expansion in every direction.\n\nAs of [[1489 DR]], tensions remained high between the Knights and both Damara and the Moonsea.",
