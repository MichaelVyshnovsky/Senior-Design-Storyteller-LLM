        "mainbody": "The Warlock Knights, also called the Warlock Knights of Vaasa, were the feudal lords of Vaasa in the late 15 century DR. They were notable for their brutality and for their aspirations of conquest beyond their borders. The Knights drew their power from an otherworldly entity they called Telos.\nThe Warlock Knights were a sworn order of knights in service to their own feudal state in Vaasa, of which they were both the lords and the elite military force. At the top of this political and martial hierarchy, the Knights were ruled by the Ironfell Council, who in turn served the Voice of Telos. The Knights took these oaths very seriously, and stressed that they held those in positions of greater power equally as accountable to a deal as those with less power.\nWarlock Knights were expected to be skilled warriors first and foremost, but all were also required to have some aptitude for arcane magic. The secret to their power, as their name implies, was from forming a kind of star pact&mdashknown as the Ironfell Pact&mdashwith the comatose primordial Telos, although this was more akin to siphoning its essence rather than making a deal with it. The Ironfell Pact also prevented from divulging the secrets of Telos or the Ironfell Council,\nThe Knights connection to Telos and to each other was solidified with a simple ceremony known as the Pact of the Iron Ring, and violations of their oaths could result in a fatal curse.\nAs rulers, the Warlock Knights were brutal taskmasters who had forced the Vaasan people into serfdom and slavery, conscripted them into their armies, As both a faction and as individuals, Warlock Knights were focused on accruing power. They were an ever-present menace to their neighbors, especially Damara to the east and the Moonsea to the south, but also the giant kingdom of Kultaakarr to the north as well as The Ride and the rest of the Moonsea North to the west. More indirectly, they exerted influence and drew concern as far as the eastern Heartlands and the Vast.\nWhile much of the Knights focus was on military power, they also attended to matters of their nations economy with similar ruthless efficiency. They aggressively established and laid claim to trade routes within and around their borders. Additionally, they developed a sophisticated system of engineering that involved complementary mechanical and magical forces to achieve great feats of construction, such as the impressive fortifications at Telos City\nThe Warlock Knights valued patience. While they were dangerous combatants themselves, Warlock Knights preferred to engage enemies with squads or platoons of underlings and humanoid slaves. Their preferred front-line fodder was orcs, but their armies also contained goblinoids and gnolls as well as viscous, suicidal constructs called shardsouls. These would charge into enemy ranks, sowing confusion and madness, followed by the fodder These squads would be supported by arcane spellcasters called Bound Ones.\nThe Knights were also known to manipulate, tame, or enslave larger, more dangerous monsters for use in battle. These included wyverns, manticores, giants, dragons, and fiends. They were also known to make use of undead as part of their tactic to shock and horrify their enemies.\nThe Warlock Knight ruled all of Vaasa, with individual Knights of high rank ruling over fiefdoms and controlling their own standing armies. However, the center of their power was Telos City, and specifically its central castle, the Citadel of the Iron Sky, which sat directly above the slumbering primordial Telos.\nthumb|left|150px|The signature ironfell ring of the Warlock Knights.\nWarlock Knights wielded weapons and equipment made of ironfell, a metal-like crystalline substance harvested from the body of Telos through which a Warlock Knight could channel the primordials power. Their more subtle agents made use of ironfell daggers and shurikens, while front line fighters tended to prefer glaives.\nEvery Warlock Knight wore a simple ironfell ring as a symbol of their status and a focus of their power, The rings further served as the foci for the Pact of the Iron Ring.\nWarlock Knights were also known to own distinctive black ceremonial armor with helmets adorned with rams horns. This armor identified them as Knights, and it was customary to never be seen in public without it. Some Knights might further enchant this armor, such as by turning it into deaths brink armor.\nThe Warlock Knights had few allies and many enemies, but so confident were they in the powers they wielded that this did not appear to concern them. At home, their own subjects feared them abjectly, For their especially hated enemies, the Knights would not only slay them but then encase their corpses within an ironfell coffins for all eternity.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, the Knights were in a perpetual standoff with the armies of Damara at Bloodstone Pass. The Knights were further opposed in their various efforts abroad by a faction of Harpers who sought to blunt their expansionist goals.\nTheir only potential ally of note was the Church of Bane, as several Warlock Knights were secretly Banites themselves. However, given the Knights culture of individualism and backstabbing, having members with ties to a god like Bane may have been more of a vulnerability than an asset.\nThe Warlock Knights were founded sometime shortly after the Spellplague when Telos fell from the sky and crashed into the Vasaan tundra. The primordial was discovered by the one who would go on to be called the Voice of Telos, and it was quickly determined that ironfell could be harvested from the body and used to enhance magical and martial abilities. \nUsing the power of Telos, the Warlock Knights waited for the right time to seize control of Vaasa from the Kingdom of Bloodstone. They began subjugating small populations of peasants and humanoids, including wiping out out a settlement of minotaurs at Kond in 1453 DR to secure the site for themselves. In 1459 DR, they took advantage of civil unrest in Bloodstone to conscript and marshal an army, and began a war of conquest across Vaasa in the . Ultimately, they burned down the former capital at Bloodstone City in the , and declared their independence from the Kingdom of Bloodstone.\nIn 1470 DR, the Knights would also attempt to conquer the dwarves of the Galena Mountains, ultimately expelling them from Bloodstone Mines and driving Hillsafar Hall to seal its gates.\nUnder the Warlock Knights, Vaasa was restructured as a brutal feudal society with its capital at Telos City, which had been built on top of the sleeping primordial. The source and true nature of the Warlock Knights power was kept a secret, and was obfuscated with an almost religious-like veneration of Telos that prohibited the worship of any gods with the exception of Bane.\nBeginning in the 1470s DR, the Warlock Knights engaged in secret efforts to undermine the Moonsea region and the tribes of The Ride with the goal of expanding their influence.\nAround this same time, the secret Banite faction within the Knights made overtures to form an alliance with the Banites in the Council of Blades in Mulmaster, and sought to keep these efforts secret from the Ironfell Council even as their delegates began to arrive in Vaasa.\nBy 1480 DR, the Knights were the masters of Vaasa south of the Lugsaas Chain mountains, and were eyeing opportunities for expansion in every direction.\nAs of 1489 DR, tensions remained high between the Knights and both Damara and the Moonsea.\nMembers of the Warlock Knights were predominantly human, especially among the higher status, ruling Knights. Hierarchy and rank were extremely important to their order. While all landed nobles in Vaasa were members of the Warlock Knights by the late 15 century DR, it was uncommon for their titles to be hereditary. Instead, most Knights earned their rank through hard work, raw power, or by undermining their rivals. They saw themselves as an elite fighting force, and only a few were considered worthy to join their ranks.\nJack\nInfantry. Members of this rank were forbidden to wear the Warlock Knights ceremonial armor or to refer to themselves as \"knights.\" Jacks were often conscripted from the Vaasan serf population.\nLancer, Halberdier, or Bombardier\nOfficers. Beginning with these ranks, members were referred to as \"knights\" and this designation could be added onto their title (e.g., Knight-Lancer, Knight-Executor, etc.). As true Warlock Knights, members of these ranks would have been expected to have at least some arcane aptitude.\nExecutor\nLandless Knights and petty nobles. Knights of this rank served as emissaries, assassins, spies, and soldiers for higher-ranking Knights. They were known to travel with entourages of underlings.\nMyrmidon or Brigadier\nAdditional ranks of landless Knights and officers above Executor.\nFellthane\nLanded Knights. They exercised absolute dominion over their fiefdoms and maintained their own fighting forces.\nVindicator\nHigh-ranking Knights to whom the Fellthanes served as vassals.  Although they were the equivalent of politically powerful nobles in other realms, they were known to lead squads personally.\n Councilor\nMembers of the Ironfell Council, made up of the twelve greatest Vindicators. This was the highest rank a Warlock Knight could achieve.\nNishaadhri\nThese warlocks served similar roles in Vaasa as wizards did in other realms by advising high ranking Knights and supporting them in battle. As a rule, any arcane practitioner in Vaasa had to swear fealty to the Warlock Knights in exchange for the freedom to pursue their magical study.\n Luminary\nThe greatest of the nishaadhri were recruited to join the Luminaries, an elite sect dedicated to venerating the primordial Telos which performed a function similar to that of priests in other lands. This sect was led by the Voice of Telos, but was technically independent of the Warlock Knights.\n* The Voice of Telos, the leader of the Ironfell Council\n* Mansard Kanaoth, a Knight-Vindicator and member of the Ironfell Council who claimed the title of Witch-King\n* Ivor Chernin, a Knight-Vindicator known as \"the Grinder\"\n* Kardhel Terov, a Knight-Fellthane active in the Moonsea region in 1479 DR\n* Vorlanth, a Knight-Fellthane who belonged to the secret Banite faction.\n* Angath, a Knight-Executor and rival to Vorlanth.\n* Kaggen Entreri, a promising young Knight-Bombardier deployed to investigate relics relating to Zhengyi the Witch-King in 1480 DR"
