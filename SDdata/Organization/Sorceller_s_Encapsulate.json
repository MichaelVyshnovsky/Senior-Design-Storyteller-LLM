        "mainbody": "The Sorcellers Encapsulate was the local guild and school comprised those spellcasters who lived in the town of Daggerford.\nThe guild regulated the magic trade within Daggerford. They only allowed spellcasters of a similar level of expertise and knowledge to trade with one another, for the safety of its more novice members.\nThe Sorcellers guildhall was located in Daggerfords Caravan Quarter near the Caravan Gate. The building of the guild was a tall three-story building with its main hall and entrance located up the stairs on the second floor. The main hall was decorated with a huge majestic circle of magic that glimmer and radiated arcane energy. The citys library was located on the first floor of the guildhall and was accessible via a stairwell from the main hall. The third floor was magically sealed off from anyone who was not the member of Sorcellers Encapsulate and was accessible via a sealed and warded door to the stairwell leading up.\nAll types of arcane and divine spellcasters were allowed to join the guild.\n*Rylett McGinn was a senior elf wizard of the guild circa 1372 DR.\n*Delfen Yellowknife  was a happy-go-lucky member of the guild circa 1372 DR."
