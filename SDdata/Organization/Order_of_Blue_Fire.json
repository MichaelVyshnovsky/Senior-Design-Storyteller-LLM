        "orgname": "the Order of Blue Fire",
        "mainbody": "The '''Order of Blue Fire''', sometimes referred to as the '''Order of Blue Flame''', was an outwardly benevolent organization whose members were known to treat and aid individuals afflicted by the [[Spellplague]], and who often travelled to [[plagueland]]s in what were referred to as [[scar pilgrimage]]s.",
        "Activities": "Across [[Faerûn]], the Order operated many hospices&mdash;called \"houses\"&mdash;whose mission was to aid those infected by the Spellplague. Their mission included both educating the populace about the Spellplague (with some houses serving as libraries of related lore) as well as providing expert treatment and management of out-of-control [[spellscar]]s.{{Cite dungeon/188/Whispered Words|5}} Among those who instead wished to acquire a spellscar, the Order was known to support these \"scar pilgrims\" in their journeys to plaguelands. Order members themselves were also known to undertake such pilgrimages for the purpose of learning about such plaguelands in order to better inform the public about their dangers and their wonders.\n\nAll of the above activities were managed by the Order's \"public works branch\". However, the Order of Blue Flame's public face and its true motives were very different. The Order's true belief was that the Spellplague was a holy event that should be continued, and so its most fanatical members sought to expand plaguelands and to spread spellscars. They were thus secretly often the ones who caused the problems that they publicly claimed to fight against, for example, by actively encouraging people to embark on scar pilgrimages.\n\nDespite their sinister activities, the Order of Blue Fire maintained a pristine reputation through the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]] thanks to their public works. The Order was widely understood to be a benevolent organization, and its members were welcome within most cities. As long as they denied any accusations of evil actions, it was nearly impossible to turn public sentiment against them.",
        "Base of Operations": {
            "Other Known Chapters": "The Order of Blue Fire was active in many other places across Faerûn, including:\n*[[Baldur's Gate]]. The Order maintained a mission in [[Scarred Alley]], which was connected to other houses via a ''[[teleportation circle]]''.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Silent Streets and Vanished Souls|12}}{{Cite organized play/LFR/Silent Streets and Vanished Souls|13}} This chapter was abandoned by the Order after subversive actions by [[Grand Duke]] [[Valarken]].\n*[[Halruaa]]. The so-called [[Temple of Blue Fire]] on [[Mount Talath]] was vigorously defended by Order forces at the fortress of [[Talathgard]].\n*[[Impiltur]]. The Order's more sinister activities in this realm were known to [[Arshryke Taranth]], the royal spymaster of Impiltur, who worked hard to foil their machinations.\n* [[Marsember]]. This chapter was established in the early-to-mid 15{{th}} century DR, and over the following decades, it handled several outbreaks of Spellplague and assisted thousands of patients with their spellscars.{{Cite LFR/CORM1-4/All the King's Men|13}}\n*[[Sshamath]]. [[Drow]] members of the Order established the [[School of Blue Fire]] in this city.{{Cite LFR/CORE2-1/Killing the Messenger|18,20}}"
        },
        "Dogma": "[[File:Sharn cultist 4e.jpg|thumb|300px|''A member of the Order of Blue Flame seeks guidance from a sharn.'']]\nThe secret faith of the Order of Blue Fire was based on the teachings of its true leaders: crazed [[sharn]]s and a mysterious entity known as the [[Masters of Absolute Accord]], and their deepest precepts further regarded the Spellplague and its energies as a [[god|divine being]], of which the sharns were said to be miraculous manifestations.\n\nOwing to the scattered organization of the Order and the sometimes contradictory edicts of the sharns and the Masters of Absolute Accord, it was not uncommon for different houses of the Order to evolve in different ways, and in some cases, schisms arose as different sects believed that the Order's dogma could be pursued in different&mdash;even truly benevolent&mdash;ways. For example, the chapter in Marsember taught that the Spellplague was part of the natural world, and that spellscars were \"gifts\" not to be cured but to be controlled and understood.{{Cite LFR/CORE2-1/Killing the Messenger|56}}",
        "History": "Originally founded during the [[Wailing Years]] as a cult dedicated to prolonging the Spellplague, the Order first came to prominence in the {{YearlinkName|1393}}, when it started aiding scar pilgrims in Ormpetarr.\n\nFollowing the events of the [[Ruining]] in [[Neverwinter]], a group of Blue Fire fanatics traveled to the [[Cathedral of Mystra (Neverwinter)|Cathedral of Mystra]] within Neverwinter's [[Chasm]] upon hearing rumors of active Spellplague within. There, they clashed with [[Scar Company]], a division within the [[Neverwinter Guard]] who battled the [[plaguechanged]] horrors within the Chasm.\n\nAs of {{Yearlink|1479}},{{4e-time}} agents of the Order operating in the [[North]] heard rumors about active Spellplague in the village of [[Deadsnows]], and sought to hire [[adventurer]]s to investigate.{{Cite organized play/LFR/Shades of Blue Fire|5}} They were similarly interested in rumors of a plaguechanged [[wight]] known as the [[Mound King]].{{Cite organized play/LFR/Shades of Blue Fire|26}}",
        "Members": {
            "Leadership Roles": {
                "Commanders": "Proselytizers and healers responsible for leading houses and caring for those afflicted by the Spellplague, sometimes by taking its energies into themselves.",
                "Loremasters": "Philosophers and [[arcane]] teachers responsible for accumulating, increasing, and spreading knowledge of the Spellplague.",
                "Knights": "Military leaders responsible for defending the Order's holdings and maintaining control over Spellplague manifestations."
            },
            "Accordants": "The Order's secret, darker objectives were pursued by an inner circle of zealots known as '''accordants''' (or '''Blue Fire accordants''').\n\nOnly true believers or truly zealous devotees of the Spellplague were invited to join the accordants and learn the Order's secrets, and generally only once they had experienced a vision or visitation from either a sharn or the Masters of Absolute Accord. In some cases, the Order would recruit [[Spellplague disciple]]s to become accordants, and their ranks were known to be both weird and diverse.\n\nAccordants were known to enter battle alongside [[aberration]]s like [[foulspawn]], [[doppelganger]]s, and [[destrachan]]s. They were also known to tame [[plaguechanged ghoul]]s for use in combat.",
            "Code Words": "Members of the Order of Blue Flame used coded language to communicate, especially among the ranks of the accrodants. Two common code words among even the lower ranks included \"taelen\" ({{Pronounce|TAY|len}}), which referred to spies within the Order or otherwise to enemies who pretended to be allies, and \"lochar\" ({{Pronounce|LOCK|arr}}), which referred to a spellscarred individual in whom the Order was interested in using, training, or restraining for the good of the Order or the public.\n\nAccordants used code words and passphrases to conceal their nefarious activities, sometimes compounding code words to create new ones. These included \"ammanant\" (an imperative to kill someone or something), \"calag\" (to capture someone or something), \"nathtag\" (to destroy someone or something completely, such as by burning, exploding, dissolving, consuming, or transforming such that no identifiable traces remained), \"orglamant\" (to question and kill by torture, and then to display the body as a warning), \"orglanathtag\" (to question under torture and then destroy without a trace), \"orglul\" (to question under torture and then keep alive and imprisoned). By the late 15{{th}} century DR, many of these code phrases had come to be learned and deciphered by the likes of the spies of Impiltur, however other phrases continued to elude them (notably \"yelve\" and \"zarrem\").",
            "Notable Members": "* [[Lanskar]], a representative of the Order active in [[Sundabar]] during the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Lucius Corgan Adaster]], the founder of the Marsember chapter. He was unaware of the darker side of his Order.\n* [[Molbelphyr Ilmtar]], a drow [[bard]] who led the School of Blue Fire in Sshamath as of the late 15{{th}} century DR.\n* [[Senobith|Senobith the Corruptor]], leader of a sect known as the [[Acolytes of Corruption]] who colonized the Cathedral of Mystra in Neverwinter.\n* [[Vraith]], the [[elf|elven]] [[wizard]] who led the chapter in Ormpetarr until her death. She was among the Order's members interested in expanding the area of plaguelands, and sought to do so via the [[Ritual of the Border]]."
