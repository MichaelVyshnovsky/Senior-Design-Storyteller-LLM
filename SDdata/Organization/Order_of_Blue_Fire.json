        "mainbody": "The Order of Blue Fire, sometimes referred to as the Order of Blue Flame, was an outwardly benevolent organization whose members were known to treat and aid individuals afflicted by the Spellplague, and who often travelled to plaguelands in what were referred to as scar pilgrimages.  \nAcross Faerûn, the Order operated many hospices&mdashcalled \"houses\"&mdashwhose mission was to aid those infected by the Spellplague. Their mission included both educating the populace about the Spellplague (with some houses serving as libraries of related lore) as well as providing expert treatment and management of out-of-control spellscars. Among those who instead wished to acquire a spellscar, the Order was known to support these \"scar pilgrims\" in their journeys to plaguelands. Order members themselves were also known to undertake such pilgrimages for the purpose of learning about such plaguelands in order to better inform the public about their dangers and their wonders.\nAll of the above activities were managed by the Orders \"public works branch\". However, the Order of Blue Flames public face and its true motives were very different. The Orders true belief was that the Spellplague was a holy event that should be continued, and so its most fanatical members sought to expand plaguelands and to spread spellscars. They were thus secretly often the ones who caused the problems that they publicly claimed to fight against, for example, by actively encouraging people to embark on scar pilgrimages.\nDespite their sinister activities, the Order of Blue Fire maintained a pristine reputation through the late 15 century DR thanks to their public works. The Order was widely understood to be a benevolent organization, and its members were welcome within most cities. As long as they denied any accusations of evil actions, it was nearly impossible to turn public sentiment against them.   \nThe Orders most active cell was located on the edge of the Plaguewrought Land in Ormpetarr, and was known as the Changing House.\nThe Order of Blue Fire was active in many other places across Faerûn, including\n*Baldurs Gate. The Order maintained a mission in Scarred Alley, which was connected to other houses via a teleportation circle. This chapter was abandoned by the Order after subversive actions by Grand Duke Valarken.\n*Halruaa. The so-called Temple of Blue Fire on Mount Talath was vigorously defended by Order forces at the fortress of Talathgard.\n*Impiltur. The Orders more sinister activities in this realm were known to Arshryke Taranth, the royal spymaster of Impiltur, who worked hard to foil their machinations.\n* Marsember. This chapter was established in the early-to-mid 15 century DR, and over the following decades, it handled several outbreaks of Spellplague and assisted thousands of patients with their spellscars.\n*Sshamath. Drow members of the Order established the School of Blue Fire in this city.\nthumb|300px|A member of the Order of Blue Flame seeks guidance from a sharn.\nThe secret faith of the Order of Blue Fire was based on the teachings of its true leaders crazed sharns and a mysterious entity known as the Masters of Absolute Accord, and their deepest precepts further regarded the Spellplague and its energies as a divine being, of which the sharns were said to be miraculous manifestations.\nOwing to the scattered organization of the Order and the sometimes contradictory edicts of the sharns and the Masters of Absolute Accord, it was not uncommon for different houses of the Order to evolve in different ways, and in some cases, schisms arose as different sects believed that the Orders dogma could be pursued in different&mdasheven truly benevolent&mdashways. For example, the chapter in Marsember taught that the Spellplague was part of the natural world, and that spellscars were \"gifts\" not to be cured but to be controlled and understood.\nOriginally founded during the Wailing Years as a cult dedicated to prolonging the Spellplague, the Order first came to prominence in the , when it started aiding scar pilgrims in Ormpetarr.\nFollowing the events of the Ruining in Neverwinter, a group of Blue Fire fanatics traveled to the Cathedral of Mystra within Neverwinters Chasm upon hearing rumors of active Spellplague within. There, they clashed with Scar Company, a division within the Neverwinter Guard who battled the plaguechanged horrors within the Chasm.\nAs of , agents of the Order operating in the North heard rumors about active Spellplague in the village of Deadsnows, and sought to hire adventurers to investigate. They were similarly interested in rumors of a plaguechanged wight known as the Mound King.\nMost of the Orders members were spellscarred, especially among those in leadership roles and among those inducted into the Orders mysteries, known as accordants. However, the Order welcomed capable non-spellscarred volunteers to perform services for them. \nLow ranking members were often unaware of the more sinister beliefs of the Orders upper echelons, and instead believed in its outward mission of good works. Among all members, those who embarked on scar pilgrimages were seen as having a bravery that was deserving of respect, regardless of whether they survived their encounters with the Spellplague.\nThe Order also had so-called \"fringe members\", who were not involved in the organization but would direct interested parties to its services.\nThe Orders hierarchy was distributed and informal. The most senior or otherwise capable members within a given house or cell tended to assume leadership positions that suited their abilities. Leadership roles included\nCommandersProselytizers and healers responsible for leading houses and caring for those afflicted by the Spellplague, sometimes by taking its energies into themselves.\nLoremasters Philosophers and arcane teachers responsible for accumulating, increasing, and spreading knowledge of the Spellplague.\nKnightsMilitary leaders responsible for defending the Orders holdings and maintaining control over Spellplague manifestations.\nThe Orders secret, darker objectives were pursued by an inner circle of zealots known as accordants (or Blue Fire accordants).\nOnly true believers or truly zealous devotees of the Spellplague were invited to join the accordants and learn the Orders secrets, and generally only once they had experienced a vision or visitation from either a sharn or the Masters of Absolute Accord. In some cases, the Order would recruit Spellplague disciples to become accordants, and their ranks were known to be both weird and diverse.\nAccordants were known to enter battle alongside aberrations like foulspawn, doppelgangers, and destrachans. They were also known to tame plaguechanged ghouls for use in combat.\nMembers of the Order of Blue Flame used coded language to communicate, especially among the ranks of the accrodants. Two common code words among even the lower ranks included \"taelen\" (), which referred to spies within the Order or otherwise to enemies who pretended to be allies, and \"lochar\" (), which referred to a spellscarred individual in whom the Order was interested in using, training, or restraining for the good of the Order or the public.\nAccordants used code words and passphrases to conceal their nefarious activities, sometimes compounding code words to create new ones. These included \"ammanant\" (an imperative to kill someone or something), \"calag\" (to capture someone or something), \"nathtag\" (to destroy someone or something completely, such as by burning, exploding, dissolving, consuming, or transforming such that no identifiable traces remained), \"orglamant\" (to question and kill by torture, and then to display the body as a warning), \"orglanathtag\" (to question under torture and then destroy without a trace), \"orglul\" (to question under torture and then keep alive and imprisoned). By the late 15 century DR, many of these code phrases had come to be learned and deciphered by the likes of the spies of Impiltur, however other phrases continued to elude them (notably \"yelve\" and \"zarrem\").\n* Lanskar, a representative of the Order active in Sundabar during the late 15 century DR.\n* Lucius Corgan Adaster, the founder of the Marsember chapter. He was unaware of the darker side of his Order.\n* Molbelphyr Ilmtar, a drow bard who led the School of Blue Fire in Sshamath as of the late 15 century DR.\n* Senobith the Corruptor, leader of a sect known as the Acolytes of Corruption who colonized the Cathedral of Mystra in Neverwinter.\n* Vraith, the elven wizard who led the chapter in Ormpetarr until her death. She was among the Orders members interested in expanding the area of plaguelands, and sought to do so via the Ritual of the Border."
