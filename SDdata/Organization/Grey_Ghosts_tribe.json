        "mainbody": "The '''Grey Ghosts''' were a bandit tribe in the [[Shaar]] in the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "Activities": "Besides their raids on the lands south of them, this tribe collected tribute from the small trading towns that laid within their territory.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Grey Ghosts operated out of the land of [[Eastern Shaar]], in a fortress south of [[Uthangol pass]]. Beyond this fortress, they controlled the lands between the city of [[Hardcastle (city)|Hardcastle]] and the lake [[Azulduth]].",
        "History": "During the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], an era when many bandit tribes in the Eastern Shaar were known to raid the southern lands of [[Mulhorand]] and [[Unther]] or the farming towns of [[Shaar]], they were one of the biggest. They struck out as far east as [[Durpar]] and as far north as [[Chessenta]].\n\nTheir leader was murdered and usurped by Chessentan [[half-elf]] mercenary named [[Furifax]]. Over time he placed agents within every major city of Unther, inciting dissent among the populace and spying on the activities of royalty. He sought to unite all the other bandit tribes within the Eastern Shaar in a united attacked against the land of Unther. His efforts were often met with little success, though in the process he attracted the attention of the [[Cult of Tiamat]]. He eventually came to form an alliance with the cult.\n\nAround [[1358 DR]], the tribe captured some small Untheric outposts that stood along the [[River of Swords]] and freed the slaves of farms that stood along the [[River Angol]].",
        "Members": "This tribe numbered five thousand trained soldirs in total during the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]], with each possessing as a [[mount]] one of the wild [[horse]]s that roamed the Eastern Shaar. They were outfitted with [[plate mail]], [[shield]]s, and [[sword]]s."
