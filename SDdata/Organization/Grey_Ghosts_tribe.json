        "mainbody": "The Grey Ghosts were a bandit tribe in the Shaar in the mid-14 century DR.\nBesides their raids on the lands south of them, this tribe collected tribute from the small trading towns that laid within their territory.\nThe Grey Ghosts operated out of the land of Eastern Shaar, in a fortress south of Uthangol pass. Beyond this fortress, they controlled the lands between the city of Hardcastle and the lake Azulduth.\nDuring the mid-14 century DR, an era when many bandit tribes in the Eastern Shaar were known to raid the southern lands of Mulhorand and Unther or the farming towns of Shaar, they were one of the biggest. They struck out as far east as Durpar and as far north as Chessenta.\nTheir leader was murdered and usurped by Chessentan half-elf mercenary named Furifax. Over time he placed agents within every major city of Unther, inciting dissent among the populace and spying on the activities of royalty. He sought to unite all the other bandit tribes within the Eastern Shaar in a united attacked against the land of Unther. His efforts were often met with little success, though in the process he attracted the attention of the Cult of Tiamat. He eventually came to form an alliance with the cult.\nAround 1358 DR, the tribe captured some small Untheric outposts that stood along the River of Swords and freed the slaves of farms that stood along the River Angol.\nThis tribe numbered five thousand trained soldirs in total during the mid-14 century DR, with each possessing as a mount one of the wild horses that roamed the Eastern Shaar. They were outfitted with plate mail, shields, and swords."
