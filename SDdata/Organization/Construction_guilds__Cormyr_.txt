The construction guilds of Cormyr were the various guilds that served the needs of bricklayers, stonemasons, joiners, and similar professions, active around 1367 DR.
They were benevolent fraternities of folk who practiced the same trade, who joined for the camaraderie and to share knowledge and advance their skills.
Like other Cormyrean craftsman guilds, these guilds were intended to take care of their members, improve working conditions, try to guarantee supplies, provide business opportunities, and oppose taxes.
Unlike the other craftsman guilds, the construction guilds enjoyed strong influence on local politics and understood how to manipulate situations to suit their own ends. They zealously promoted their own interests.
