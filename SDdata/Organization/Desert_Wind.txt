The Desert Wind was a bandit organization located in the Plains of Purple Dust during the mid–14th century DR.
The Desert Wind had roughly 350 members, most of whom were warriors equipped with leather armor or chain mail. They were ruled by Sheik Ar-Rabi, who was served by his lieutenants Yasir and Mabad. Abu Jafar, a priest of Cyric, and Al-Warrakh, a wizard, aided the Sheik on raids.
The Grinning Skull oasis served as their base of operations.
The Desert Wind raided the scattered tribes of the Plains of Purple Dust and southern Murghôm.
Bandits of the Desert Wind would force prisoners, and even lizards, to drink from the dangerous pools of the Grinning Skull until they discovered which pool was safe to drink from on that particular day.
