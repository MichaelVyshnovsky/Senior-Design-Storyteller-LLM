The '''Watchers of Candlekeep''' were the guardians tasked with the protection of the library-fortress of [[Candlekeep]].

==Organization==
These protectors were led by the individual known as the Gatewarden. They were aided in their efforts by the Keeper of the Partal, who stood guard over the keep's main entrance from the [[Way of the Lion]].

Each of the four Watchers led a contingent of a dozen well-armed [[monk]]s.

==Activities==
They spent much of their time patrolling the grounds of Candlekeep and surveying the surrounding landscape for danger.

==Possessions==
The Watchers were said to have been equipped with [[magic]]al [[:Category:Rings|rings]] and [[Item enchantment|enchanted]] [[:Category:Rods|rods]] to aid them in their duties.
