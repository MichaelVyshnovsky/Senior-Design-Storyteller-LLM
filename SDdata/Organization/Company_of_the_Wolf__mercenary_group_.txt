The '''Company of the Wolf''' was a disbanded mercenary company.

==History==
Around [[1358 DR]], the Company of the Wolf worked well protecting merchants from the [[Sword Coast]] to the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] for two decades until their leaders went with a crazy idea: to assault and destroy [[Zhentil Keep]]. Although they managed to place a spy inside the keep, the Company was eradicated by [[orc]]s and others [[humanoid]]s unleashed by the [[Zhentarim]].
