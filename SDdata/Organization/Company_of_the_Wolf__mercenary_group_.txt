The Company of the Wolf was a disbanded mercenary company.
Around 1358 DR, the Company of the Wolf worked well protecting merchants from the Sword Coast to the Sea of Fallen Stars for two decades until their leaders went with a crazy idea to assault and destroy Zhentil Keep. Although they managed to place a spy inside the keep, the Company was eradicated by orcs and others humanoids unleashed by the Zhentarim.
