The '''Red Sisters''' were an elite band of [[assassin]]s that the [[Valsharess]] formed to help her with her plans for taking over the surface, starting with [[Waterdeep]] in the early 1370s [[DR]]. The Red Sisters assassinated a lot of important people in Waterdeep who were seen as a threat to the Valsharess. In the end, [[Mephistopheles]], the ruler of [[Cania]], killed the last of the Red Sisters.<ref>
