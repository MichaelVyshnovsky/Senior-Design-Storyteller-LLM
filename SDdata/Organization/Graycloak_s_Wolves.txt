Graycloaks Wolves was an adventuring company active in 1343 DR, and led by Irmar Graycloak.
Graycloaks Wolves were active in the city of Hlondeth in the Vilhon Reach in the Year of the Boot, 1343 DR, when they were requested to deliver the Tome of Torment—the most holy book of the church of Ilmater—to Master Sufferer Olbedan in Aralent. However, during the harsh winter, Graycloaks Wolves fell prey to doppelgangers and leucrotta preying on travellers. The Tome was thought lost in the winter snows.
