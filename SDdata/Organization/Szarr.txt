The '''Szarr''' family was a family of [[Baldur's Gate]] who were once wealthy merchants and farmers.

==History==
This family once held a large area of land in what would become the [[Tumbledown]] district of Baldur's Gate's [[Outer City]]. However, an unknown rival family trespassed onto their land and killed every member, or so it seemed. Instead of being done with the foul deed, the rivals of the Szarrs would raze their entire estate. After the tragic incident, Tumbledown was filled with fog. In addition, the Outer City expanded over the area, and it would become a large cemetery.

Decades prior to [[1482 DR]], a portion of the cliffs that surrounded the area fell away. Because of this, part of the family crypts were revealed; graverobbers seized the opportunity to plunder the tombs. Oddly, these crypts would glow green and red. In order to stop the residents plundering the crypts, the [[Gravemakers]] was formed. This organization protected the dead and their valuables, though also were tasked with taking down [[undead]], should they spawn. They operated out of the ruined [[Szarr Mansion]] in the middle of the graveyard.

In [[1492 DR]], a coven of [[vampire]]s was led by the power-obsessed [[vampire lord]] patriarch [[Cazador Szarr]]. It was unknown how Cazador had survived the massacre of the entire Szarr family and it was also unknown if there were other members of the Szarr family in the coven. One of Cazador's slaves, [[Astarion]] reported that he was turned into a [[vampire spawn]] almost two centuries prior to 1492 DR. Astarion was later captured by a [[nautiloid]] that crashed far to the east of the city, and Cazador sent a [[Gur]] to hunt him down.

==Rumors & Legends==
It was heavily rumored that Szarr family [[ghost]]s stalked the streets of Tumbledown. Some even claimed that the undead family would kidnap folk of the city and murder them outright. 

Some residents of Baldur's Gate believed that the ghosts of the Szarr family preyed on the Gravemakers, though others said that they aided them.
