        "mainbody": "The Stag Runners were a group of Sembite adventurers who operated circa 1369 DR. Although a legal company in Cormyr, they were generally an unprincipled bunch who cared more for profit than laws or decency.\nIn the , the Runners attended a party hosted by Lord Partic Thistle at Thistleflame Keep in Suzail. The occasion was King Azoun Obarskyr IVs birthday, and Lord Thistle hoped to improve the standing of adventuring companies in Cormyr by having them present themselves as a gesture of fealty to the King.\nDuring the party, the bard Mendryll Belarod performed an outrageously bawdy ballad featuring a pair of Sembite merchants, a harpy, and a dryad. The Stag Runners were so offended, they left the celebrations early and plotted an ambush where they would exact revenge on the bard. When they executed the attack, Mendryll managed to defend himself until another group of adventurers rescued him, and the Stag Runners were arrested by Aleka Ravenheart and her Purple Dragons detachment.\nThis provided them with an unexpected benefit â€” when the Emerald Swords company attempted to frame the Stag Runners and the Gold Coins groups for the false murder of Lord Thistle, they had the perfect alibi.\n* Alanis Flamehair, a priestess of Sune.\n* Gamara, the groups wizard.\n* Donzo Shadowkisser, a sneaky rogue.\n* Walpur, a brutish fighter.\n* Becket and Tram, twin fighters."
