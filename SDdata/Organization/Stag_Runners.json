        "mainbody": "The '''Stag Runners''' were a group of [[Sembia|Sembite]] [[adventurer]]s who operated ''circa'' [[1369 DR]]. Although a legal company in [[Cormyr]], they were generally an unprincipled bunch who cared more for profit than laws or decency.",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Runners attended a party hosted by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] at [[Thistleflame Keep]] in [[Suzail]]. The occasion was King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]'s birthday, and Lord Thistle hoped to improve the standing of adventuring companies in Cormyr by having them present themselves as a gesture of fealty to the King.\n\nDuring the party, the [[bard]] [[Mendryll Belarod]] performed an outrageously bawdy ballad featuring a pair of Sembite merchants, a [[harpy]], and a [[dryad]]. The Stag Runners were so offended, they left the celebrations early and plotted an ambush where they would exact revenge on the bard. When they executed the attack, Mendryll managed to defend himself until another group of adventurers rescued him, and the Stag Runners were arrested by [[Aleka Ravenheart]] and her [[Purple Dragons]] detachment.\n\nThis provided them with an unexpected benefit â€” when the [[Emerald Swords]] company attempted to frame the Stag Runners and the [[Gold Coins]] groups for the false murder of Lord Thistle, they had the perfect alibi.",
        "Known Stag Runners": "* [[Alanis Flamehair]], a [[priestess]] of [[Sune]].\n* [[Gamara]], the group's [[wizard]].\n* [[Donzo Shadowkisser]], a sneaky [[rogue]].\n* [[Walpur]], a brutish [[fighter]].\n* [[Becket and Tram]], twin fighters."
