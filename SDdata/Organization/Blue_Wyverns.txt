The Blue Wyverns were an adventuring company based in Ravens Bluff in the Vast in the late 15 century DR.
In the , Jack Ravenwild hired the Blue Wyverns at a pay rate of 500 gold pieces each to help him recover the Sarkonagael, a spellbook of shadow magic from the ancient dwarven city of Sarbreen located beneath Ravens Bluff. In Sarbreen, the group fought and defeated a tribe of troglodytes who were in service to a beholder. Once they found the book in the Temple of the Soulforger they had to fight Myrkyssa Jelans gang, the Moon Daggers, for possession of the book.
Later, Jack hired the Blue Wyverns to back him up when he delivered a shadow simulacrum of himself to a mage who was trying to imprison Jack once again in the mythal beneath Ravens Bluff. Jack hired the group a third time to ambush and capture the notorious slaver Fetterfist.
