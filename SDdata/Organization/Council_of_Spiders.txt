The '''Council of Spiders''' was an organization of [[drow]] [[wizard]]s who sought representation on the [[Ruling Council (Menzoberranzan)|Ruling Council]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
In the late 15{{th}} century DR, minor wizards of various noble houses of Menzoberranzan (most prominently [[House Xorlarrin]] and [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]]) formed the Council of Spiders to gain seats on the Ruling Council alongside the priestesses of [[Lolth]].

[[Raelaryn Xorlarrin]], one of the Council's elders, invited his cousin [[Hoshtar Xorlarrin|Hoshtar]] to a meeting in the ruins of [[House Srune'Lett]]'s compound in [[Narbondellyn]]. During the meeting, Raelaryn and an elder from House Barrison Del'Armgo were killed by [[Merinid Dalael]], an assassin from the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]], and Hoshtar was taken captive. Adventurers in the employ of House Xorlarrin, [[House Melarn (Menzoberranzan)|House Melarn]], and [[Bregan D'aerthe]] arrived looking for the prisoner, resulting in a fight with the Council of Spiders. However, the adventurers defeated Merinid and rescued Hoshtarr, discovering the assassins' plot.

The Council also set up a meeting with the [[Archmage of Menzoberranzan]], [[Gromph Baenre]].

By [[1486 DR]], the Council was sponsored by renegade archmage [[Vizeran DeVir]] and they supported him in plots against the [[matron mother]]s.

==Members==
Elders of the Council of Spiders included Raelaryn Xorlarrin and a low-ranking noble of House Barrison Del'Armgo. Other members from House Xorlarrin were senior wizards [[Filraen Xorlarrin|Filraen]] and [[Nym Brael Xorlarrin|Nym Brael]] and junior wizards [[Krenaste Xorlarrin|Krenaste]] and [[Tarlyn Xorlarrin|Tarlyn]].
