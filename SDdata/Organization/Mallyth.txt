House Mallyth was a former noble house of Tethyr that rose to prominence several centuries before 1479 DR.
Due to their questionable activities, which included blackmail and influence peddling, they were soon stripped of their noble status. After losing their nobility, they left Tethyr for Scornubel, Sembia, Westgate and other cities. The family continued to engage in disreputable activities and reportedly traded demonic goods from the Abyss.
