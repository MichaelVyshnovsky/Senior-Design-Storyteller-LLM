In [[1372 DR]], '''House Jaelre''' was the largest [[drow]] faction in [[Cormanthor]], accounting for about 11% of the drow population. 

==Objectives==

After their expulsion from [[Menzoberranzan]] House Jaelre sought to establish a settlement in [[Cormanthor]] after discovering a portal in the [[Underdark]] leading there. House Jaelre specifically looked to repopulate a section of [[Cormanthor]] which had been abandoned by elves in the wake of the [[Retreat]].

Toward that end, they aimed to satisfy the three requirements of a state: territory (the region around the [[Elven Court]]), population, and power to defend their borders. They aimed to achieve this goal through modifying [[elf|elven]] magic, specifically the [[mythal]]s within the ruins of the [[Elven Court]], into forms that would protect them.

==Activities==

House Jaelre claimed the abandoned [[Elven Court]] The elves who abandoned the [[Elven Court]] in favor of [[Evermeet]] destroyed the largest structures in the area before they left. Members of House Jaelre generally remained on the upper sections of the ruins because the lower sections were riddled with mortally dangerous [[trap]]s.

House Jaelre repurposed [[elf|elven]] structures when possible, but also constructed their own buildings. and places from which to strike against their enemies. As a general rule, such buildings had at least one [[Underdark]] level.

They maintained agricultural traditions from the Underdark and did not grow surface food. Instead they acquired surface food through gathering, hunting, and trading.

House Jaelre often covertly stirred trouble in distant lands, such as Mistledale, to trick their non-drow enemies into attacking their drow enemies, thereby diverting attention from themselves and weakening their enemies.

==Members==

House Jaelre’s members were followers of [[Vhaeraun]] and organized in a fashion resembling a military structure.

They were led by a council of four members. These were:

* [[Nurkinyan]], a cleric; he was the spiritual leader as well as the leader of the leading council
* [[Belarbreeza]], a wizard; she led the study efforts of the mythal
* [[Jezz the Lame]], a rogue-sorcerer; he led the striking forces among others against Mistledale
* [[Tebryn]], a rogue-fighter; he was responsible for House Jaelre’ defenses

In contrast to other religious drow groups, where clerics take leadership roles based on their strength, House Jaelre did not seem to prioritize this approach. Instead, House Jaelre appeared to give more importance to secular standards. This distinction became apparent as the High Priest [[Tzirik Jaelre]] possessed the ability to cast spells like ''[[astral projection]]'' and  ''[[gate]]'', while their leader, Nurkinyan, lacked such capabilities. 

==Relationships==
House Jaelre was formerly a [[List of drow houses|drow house]] from [[Menzoberranzan]] and continued to be composed of [[drow]] after their relocation to [[Cormanthor]]. 

After their departure from the [[Underdark]], House Jaelre abandoned their racial hatred towards elves. Enemies of House Jaelre, such as the [[Eldreth Veluuthra]], exploited racial hatred against drow to their advantage. They often disguised themselves as drow, raiding human wanderers and settlements to sow discontent and provoke hostility from humans. House Jaelre, themselves, used this strategy to deceive their non-drow enemies into attacking their drow enemies, simultaneously weakening two enemies at once.

House Jaelre considered all drow sworn to [[Lolth]] as enemies.{{Cite web/Obsul Ssussun, "The Door to Light"}} Eventually, this cooperation developed into a formal alliance called the Masked Brigades. 

==Magic and Skills==

Each member of House Jaelre’s fighting forces was provided with magic items which included at least one healing potion.

House Jaelre displayed a preference for magic items that augmented their own abilities and the intrinsic power of items. These were items usable by anyone. For instance, specialists in stealth were provided with ''[[boots of elvenkind]]'', ''[[elixir of sneaking]]'' and potions of ''[[cat’s grace]]'', while warriors were provided with ''[[gauntlets of ogre power]]'' and potions of ''[[bear’s endurance]]''. Potions of spells like ''[[blur]]'' and ''[[invisibility]]'' were also common.

Their armor and weapons were enchanted to enhance basic capabilities, prioritizing durability over gimmicks.

As [[drow]], they utilized ''[[Piwafwi|piwafwis]]'' and ''[[drow house insignia|drow house insignias]]''. More unqiue items included ''[[fire elementals gem|fire elementals gems]]'' and ''[[ring of antivenom|rings of antivenom]]''.

House Jaelre heavily employed alchemical goods and poisons. In addition to common items like ''[[Smokestick|smokesticks]]'', ''[[acid flasks]]'', ''[[alchemical fire]]'', ''[[thunderstone]]'', or ''[[Tanglefoot bag|tanglefoot bags]]'',

A distinctive trait of House Jaelre's members was their aptitude in stealth, and the fact that many overcame the drow race's weakness to sunlight.

==History==
House Jaelre resided in [[Menzoberranzan]] until they were expelled from the city. One account suggests that the house was ousted approximately 500 years before [[1372 DR]] due to outrage over the fact that they had a male leader and venerated [[Vhaeraun]] instead of [[Lolth]]. Another account suggests they lost a civil war and were driven out of the city only decades before 1372 DR.   

After being cast out from Menzoberranzan, House Jaelre wandered the [[Underdark]] in exile. they found a [[portal]] in the newly sacked [[Blingdenstone]], taking them to areas within the forest of [[Cormanthor]] that had formerly been protected by [[mythal]]s.)

In Cormanthor, House Jaelre set up their base in [[Minauthkeep]], an abandoned [[elf|elven]] fort.

House Jaelre sought to occupy the ruins of the [[Elven Court]] and make use of the mythals and [[Ward|wards]] there to keep their enemies at bay. To distract from this undertaking, they sent a force led by [[Jezz the Lame]] to stir trouble in [[Dalelands|Dalesfolk]]. 

House Jaelre had relatively little conflict with [[Clan Auzkovyn]], which arrived in Cormanthor around the same time. The latter, being nomadic, did not contest Jaelre's holdings. 

A century later, Valan Jaelre (as a simulacrum of himself) led the [[drow]] to attack [[Shadowdale]] and steal the ''[[Pendant of Ashaba]]''.
