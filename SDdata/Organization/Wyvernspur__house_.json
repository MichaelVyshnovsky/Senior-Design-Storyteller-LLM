The family also owned Wyvernspur House in Suzail.\nThe family owned most of the land surrounding Wyvernwater and the Wyvernflow, bringing substantial wealth and political influence. House Wyvernspur had additional holdings in Hultail. The Hullack Forest was mentioned as also belonging to the Wyvernspurs.\nThe crown of Cormyr often called upon this family to fund projects in their area and near Hullack Forest. In the event of Azoun IVs death during the Abraxus incident, this family favored a Vangerdahast regency instead of a ruling council.\nThe Wyvernspurs were granted all Cormaeril lands after the Cormaerils were stripped of title after the Abraxus affair, which approximately quintupled the income and responsibilities of House Wyvernspur.\nIn the late 15 century DR, House Wyvernspur thrived, flush with money, number of living family members, and family accolades.\n* Asmarra \"Mara\" Wyvernspur, a successful adventurer,  older sister of Everend and sister to Lyriasara in the late 15 century DR.\n* Everend Paerevel Wyvernspur, an adventurer and younger brother to Lyriasara and Asmarra, and older brother of at least two other sisters in the late 15 century DR.\n* Lyriasara \"Leera\" Wyvernspur, a successful adventurer, older sister of Everend and sister to Asmarra in the late 15 century DR."
