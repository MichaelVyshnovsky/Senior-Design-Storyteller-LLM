The Thunkers was a bandit organization in Damara in 1359 DR.
The Thunkers originated in 1357 DR after the first defeat of the bandit army of the Grandfather of Assassins against Gareth Dragonsbane. The stone giants Rocktooth, Boulderhead, Bearcrusher deserted the bandit army together with some other humanoids and went back to the Galena Mountains. After some time, however, bored by that life they went back to central Damara raiding small towns and adventuring parties. In time, many other humanoids joined the band. They all had a bounty over their heads for their crimes and were particularly hated by the dwarves of Ironspur, one of their favorite targets.
