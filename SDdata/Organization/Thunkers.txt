The '''Thunkers''' was a bandit organization in [[Damara]] in [[1359 DR]].

==History==
The Thunkers originated in [[1357 DR]] after the first defeat of the bandit army of the [[Grandfather of Assassins]] against [[Gareth Dragonsbane]]. The [[stone giant]]s [[Rocktooth]], [[Boulderhead]], [[Bearcrusher]] deserted the bandit army together with some other [[humanoid]]s and went back to the [[Galena Mountains]]. After some time, however, bored by that life they went back to central [[Damara]] raiding small towns and adventuring parties. In time, many other humanoids joined the band. They all had a bounty over their heads for their crimes and were particularly hated by the [[dwarves]] of [[Ironspur]], one of their favorite targets.
