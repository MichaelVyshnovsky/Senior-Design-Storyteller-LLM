The '''Crimmor Guard''' was a trained organization of armored [[fighter]]s responsible for defending the city of [[Crimmor]] and patrolling its surroundings.{{Cite dragon/334/Crimmor: City of Caravans|22-34}}

==Organization==
The Guard served many purposes related to defending the city, such as patrolling the streets or manning the surrounding walls and towers. 

===Ranks===
The Guard had specific titles for the members of their forces. A patrol usually consisted of twelve members, whose commanding officer was called the '''helm'''. Helm commanders were called '''resker''', a title also used by the jailers. Commanding above every other members were the four '''high swords''', who reported directly under the Mayor.

One was able to recognize the rank of a guard by counting red ''teardrops of blood'' visible on their tabards, above the city symbol: one drop for a ''helm'', two for a ''resker'' and three for a ''high sword''.

==Possessions==

During the mid-to-late 14{{th}} Century [[DR]], members of the guard wore [[chainmail]] under red [[tabard]]s emblazoned in gold with the city symbol. During a patrol, every member wore a [[helmet]], [[gauntlet]]s, and thigh-high [[boots]] fitted with pouches. the latter also being used to keep [[dove]]s from nesting on building facades.

Should they need to apprehend an offender, guards carried with them leather thongs, leg-hobbles (made of stiff leather), collars and leashes. Those equipment was kept inside their leg-pouches.

==Relationships==
The Guard worked closely with the ''Bargemen'', who patrolled the [[Alandor River]], the westbound [[River Road (Amn)|River Road]], and the docks.

They also worked with the '''[[Shadow Thieves]]''' guild, which regulated criminal activities in the city and enforced a strict no-theft policy.

==Members==
* [[Branwyn Vaupel]] was the youngest High Sword of the guard, ''circa'' [[1374 DR]].
* [[Lydan Prowl]] was a [[halfling]] and detective within the guard, at the same period as Branwyn.

==Rumors==
According to [[Volothamp Geddarm]], guards were nicknamed ''Lobsterlouts'' because of the high-backed armor they wore made of rigid maroon leather.
