The Crimmor Guard was a trained organization of armored fighters responsible for defending the city of Crimmor and patrolling its surroundings.
The Guard served many purposes related to defending the city, such as patrolling the streets or manning the surrounding walls and towers. 
The Guard had specific titles for the members of their forces. A patrol usually consisted of twelve members, whose commanding officer was called the helm. Helm commanders were called resker, a title also used by the jailers. Commanding above every other members were the four high swords, who reported directly under the Mayor.
One was able to recognize the rank of a guard by counting red teardrops of blood visible on their tabards, above the city symbol one drop for a helm, two for a resker and three for a high sword.

During the mid-to-late 14 Century DR, members of the guard wore chainmail under red tabards emblazoned in gold with the city symbol. During a patrol, every member wore a helmet, gauntlets, and thigh-high boots fitted with pouches. the latter also being used to keep doves from nesting on building facades.
Should they need to apprehend an offender, guards carried with them leather thongs, leg-hobbles (made of stiff leather), collars and leashes. Those equipment was kept inside their leg-pouches.
The Guard worked closely with the Bargemen, who patrolled the Alandor River, the westbound River Road, and the docks.
They also worked with the Shadow Thieves guild, which regulated criminal activities in the city and enforced a strict no-theft policy.
