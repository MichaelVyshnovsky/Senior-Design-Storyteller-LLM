Those with the most income were awarded seats. Because of this, at least a few council seats changed hands on a yearly basis. \n\nAs of [[1367 DR]], [[Kara Jeratma]] was the head of the council; a position her family held since her great-grandfather [[Jeradeem]].\n\nAside from the main Council, each city within the Shining Lands had their own version of the Council of Merchants consisting of the eleven richest merchants within that particular city.",
