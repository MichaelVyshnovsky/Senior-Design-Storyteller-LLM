The '''Lightfingers''' was the only [[thieves' guild]] of note in the city of [[Yhep]] along the [[Lake of Steam]] during the mid-to-late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref name=EotSS-p170">

==Activities==
The familial members of the Lightfingers preferred to rob the homes of wealthy citizens of Yhep when they weren't home. They rarely accosted victims directly on the street like petty criminals.<ref name=EotSS-p170"/>

==History==
The roots of the Lightfingers began with a feud between the Dabichi and Harauntan families of Yhep during the late 13{{th}} century DR. A member of the Harauntan's cheated a Dabichi out of their inheritence, leaving the family on hard times and eventually costing them their status as nobles. The Dabichis swore vengeance after that act and turned to stealing what they needed to make ends meet.<ref name=EotSS-p170"/>
