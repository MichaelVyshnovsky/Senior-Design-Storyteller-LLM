The '''Home Guard''', also known as '''Benju's Home Guard''', were a unit of [[samurai]] protecting the town of [[Aru]] and [[Aru Province]] in the nation of [[Wa]] in the 1770s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==Organization==
The Home Guard were commanded directly by [[Toshikazu Wada]] and were in the service of [[Benju Matsutomo]], the [[daimyo]] of the province. They were trained by [[Yuji Takaesu]], a vassal and friend of Benju. Yuji was assisted by [[Buntaro Ostato]], who also had some authority over the samurai.

Thanks to Yuji's training, the Home Guard samurai were among the finest in the country, said to be equal even to the [[shogun]]'s personal bodyguard, and were known to be incorruptible.

==Activities==
They patrolled the passes of the surrounding [[Ikuyu Mountains]] and escorted the trains of [[pilgrim]] both visiting and leaving Aru. They also maintained peace in the town and its environs, by operating as a police force They provided security at official functions for the daimyo and dignitaries and acted as bodyguards for the daimyo himself. They also engaged in crowd control during events such as the Ceremony of the Three Thousand Steps conducted at the [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]].

==Base of Operations==
The samurai lived and were based in the Castle District of Aru.

==Possessions==
They were armed at all times with a "''[[daisho]]''" of [[katana]] and [[wakizashi]], and might carry a [[daikyu]] (bow) with twelve [[arrow]]s, a [[sode garami]] or a [[mancatcher]] as needed for an assignment. They had a uniform with a brown kimono and could wear any kind of [[armor]] according to the situation, from none at all to [[leather armor]] to [[scale mail]].
