'''Clan Tarseth''' was one of the warrior clans of [[Tethyr]]'s [[First Age of Tethyr|First Age]].

==Organization==
The clan was led by a chieftain.

==Base of Operations==
The clan's territory was in the region of the town of [[Velen]], in the [[Dragon's Head Peninsula]], and its manor house was [[Millvuthan]].

==Relationships==
One of the clan chieftains married the daughter of [[Selanlar]] of the [[Tethir (tribe)|Tethir tribe]] of elves. His oldest [[half-elven]] daughter, [[Saraala Ithal|Saraala]], married King [[Darrom Ithal]] to become the first queen of Tethyr. The marriage helped to unite the clans and strengthen relations with their elven neighbors in the [[Forest of Tethir]].

==Members==
* [[Saraala Tarseth]], who became Queen Saraala Ithal.
* [[Amir Tarseth I]], brother of Queen Saraala and chieftain of the clan in {{Yearlink|-183}}.
* [[Amir Tarseth II]], son of Chieftain Amir I.
* [[Ra'id Tarseth II]], another son of Chieftain Amir I.

==History==
Tarseth was one of the early clans present during the founding of Tethyr. The marriage of Saraala Tarseth to King Darrom in the {{YearlinkName|-211}} helped unify the clans for a time; however, Saraala's own brother Amir I was responsible for the assassination of the king in {{Yearlink|-183}}.

To restore the clan's honor, Chieftain Amir's two sons, Amir and Ra'id, killed their own father in support of their cousin [[Silvam Ithal]], who took the throne of Tethyr in his dead father's stead.

The entire clan died out in the {{YearlinkName|-133}}, when a massive tidal wave engulfed the city of Velen, slaughtering half of the town's population. (Even as late as {{Yearlink|1370}}, [[ghost]]s from Clan Tarseth still haunted the manor house of Millvuthan, then owned by the count of [[Firedrake (county)|Firedrake]]. On [[Midsummer]]'s night, the anniversary of the tidal wave, the screams of all the drowning souls and the roar of the wave itself could be heard in the physical realm.)

After â€“133, The clan's lands became a royal protectorate overseen by Prince [[Tyrom Ithal]].
