        "mainbody": "he Becloaked were a group of eerie and enigmatic druids who inhabited The Archdruids Grove in Mosstone.\nDruids only known as the Becloaked were truly a mysterious bunch. These individuals of unknown gender wore gray-colored thick, heavily-cowled robes that completely obfuscated their features, faces, and showed no skin.\nThree of these Becloaked druids were always seen patrolling the Archdruids Grove under the commands of the Archdruid himself. The Becloaked slowly walked their strange routes, and no one seemed to know the patrols purpose. On occasions, they gathered around a random tree and stayed motionless for several minutes until resuming the route. The Becloaked spoke rarely and always in harshly whispered questions when addressed, like \"Dont you have anything better to do?\" Young acolyte druids tended to avoid the Becloaked, moving to the opposite side of a path and scattering out of the robed figures way. On the other hand, the watchghosts that inhabited the Archdruids Grove paid the Becloaked no mind.\nAccording to Volothamp Geddarms testimony recorded in the infamous writers guide to Amn and Tethyr published in the late 14 century DR, he once witnessed a glimpse of a Becloakeds hand â€“ covered in tiny green iridescent scales. However, Volo was unsure if what he saw was simply a lightly-fitted glove."
