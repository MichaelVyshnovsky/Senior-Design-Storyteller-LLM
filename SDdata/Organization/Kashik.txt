The Kashik were an elite organization from the Hordelands during the 14th century DR.
10,000 men comprised the Kashik. They were formed from the most elite members of the army.
Only members of the Kashik were allowed to wear special black kalats, easily making them stand out from the common soldiers.
The Kashik served as the personal bodyguard of the Great Khan. Day and night shifts helped prevent any assassination attempts on their lord.
