        "orgname": "the Brotherhood of the Griffon",
        "mainbody": "The '''Brotherhood of the Griffon''' was a mercenary company led by [[Aoth Fezim]]. The organization took its name from its [[griffon]] riders.  Although the Brotherhood was best known for its griffon riders, they had companies of archers and spearmen as well.",
        "History": {
            "Origins": "The Brotherhood was a continuation of Aoth's Thayan [[Griffon Legion]].",
            "Thayan War": "In the years after the [[Spellplague]] of [[1385 DR]], Aoth founded the Brotherhood in [[Aglarond]]. The Brotherhood worked for Aglarond but, when Aoth learned of [[Szass Tam]]'s plan to conduct the [[Ritual of Unmaking]], the Brotherhood broke their contract with Aglarond, even going so far as to fight their former employers.\n\nAoth led the Brotherhood and the [[Zulkir]]s' forces into [[Thay]] in the {{YearlinkName|1478}}, where they successfully disrupted Szass Tam's ritual, possibly saving [[Toril]] from destruction.",
            "Impiltur": "After defeating Szass Tam, later that year, Aoth led the Brotherhood to [[Impiltur]] where they took a contract to eliminate a cult of demon worshipers. But the Brotherhood was betrayed by a noble and were unable to save a village from destruction by the cult. Because of their failure, they were dismissed from their employment in Impiltur.",
            "Chessenta": "After the disaster in Impiltur, the only employment the Brotherhood could find was with a noble from [[Luthcheq]] in [[Chessenta]]. There had been a series of mysterious murders in the city and the noble was concerned that the city militia was unable to maintain order. Aoth and the Brotherhood tracked down and killed the murderers, finding them to be [[abishai]] disguised as [[dragonborn]].\n\nTwo officers in the Brotherhood discovered Tchazzar imprisoned in the [[Shadowfell]]. They rescued Tchazzar and he returned to Chessenta to reclaim his throne.\n\nShortly after Tchazzar's return, [[Threskel]] invaded Chessenta in the {{YearlinkName|1479}}. The Brotherhood lifted the siege of [[Soolabax]] and were key to defeating the Threskelan forces in two battles that ended the war and forced Threskel to become a vassal state of Chessenta.",
            "Tymanther Conflict": "After [[Alasklerbanbastos]] was destroyed, Aoth and [[Cera Eurthos]], a priestess of [[Amaunator]], took the [[dracolich]]'s [[phylactery]] and resurrected his soul in the body of a young [[blue dragon]]. During questioning, Alasklerbanbastos revealed that he and Tchazzar were participants in the [[dragon|draconic]] game of [[Xorvintaal]] and that Tchazzar was attempting to conquer the [[human]] lands on the southern side of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to score points. Tchazzar intended to manipulate [[Akanûl]] into joining forces with Chessenta to invade [[Tymanther]].\t  \n\nIn order to prevent the war, Aoth and Cera traveled to Akanûl to convince Queen [[Arathane]] not to ally with Tchazzar.  At the same time another officer, [[Khouryn Skulldark]], journeyed to [[High Imaskar]] to ask the [[Imaskari]] to ally with Tymanther.  Both groups were successful in their missions but Tchazzar continued to plan his invasion of Tymanther.\n\nTchazzar later learned of the Brotherhood's manipulations and attacked Aoth's forces, setting off the [[Battle of Luthcheq]]. The Brotherhood of the Griffon, along with allied Akanûlan troops and Chessentans loyal to [[Shala Karanok]], defeated Tchazzar's forces and killed Tchazzar.\n\nThe Brotherhood's success against Tchazzar redeemed their reputation as a mercenary troop. Because of the political instability of the southern Sea of Fallen Stars, Aoth intended to keep the Brotherhood in Chessenta in the hopes of future income."
