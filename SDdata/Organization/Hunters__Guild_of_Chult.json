They were experts in luring and hunting of such jungle creatures, and were known to spend [[tenday]]s at a time out in the wilds of Chult. They were also known to trade in hunting supplies, bait, and [[weapon]]s with other hunters, often in exchange for each other's hunting trophies.",

        "History": "During the events of the [[death curse]],{{ToA-time}} [[Volothamp Geddarm]] encountered the guild and was in disbelief at some of their hunting stories, and of course told them many exaggerated tales in return. He quickly became fascinated by their hunts, even directing [[adventurer]]s to work with them in hopes of gaining information for his guidebooks.\n\nWhen the lost city of [[Omu]] was rediscovered, the hunters of the guild were excited to hunt for rare beasts within the ruins. During that same period, the guild contacted Port Nyanzaru's [[Tearah Initoo|Master of the Market]] in order to find a [[leatherworker]] who could fashion durable equipment out of [[manticore]] hide.",
        "Members": "As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, notable members of the guild included:\n\n* [[Agnar|Agnar of Many Teeth]], an expert [[dinosaur]] hunter.\n* [[Aryn Vasar]], a hunter of [[undead]] and other abominations.\n* [[Desha|Desha of the Shadows]], a hunter of [[beast]]s.\n* [[Doriak|Doriak of the Shells]], a hunter of [[giant insect]]s and the like.\n* [[Mirea Sain]], a seasoned huntress who acquired equipment for the guild.\n* [[Ragash|Ragash of the Red Mist]], a hunter of more intelligent prey."
