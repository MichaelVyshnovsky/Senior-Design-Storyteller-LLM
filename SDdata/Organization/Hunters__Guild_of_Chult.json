        "mainbody": "The Hunters Guild of Chult, also known simply as the hunters guild or the Hunters, was a collective of fearsome hunters operating out of Port Nyanzaru in Chult as of the late 15 century DR.\nThe hunters of the guild were known to be extremely serious in their pursuit of some of Chults most ferocious and frightening monsters. They were experts in luring and hunting of such jungle creatures, and were known to spend tendays at a time out in the wilds of Chult. They were also known to trade in hunting supplies, bait, and weapons with other hunters, often in exchange for each others hunting trophies.\nThe guild congregated to plan hunts and purchase lures at Hunters Square near the main gate of Port Nyanzaru.\nMembers of the guild wore light armor in order to allow them to operate in the jungle, and they were always in need of fresh equipment.\nDuring the events of the death curse, Volothamp Geddarm encountered the guild and was in disbelief at some of their hunting stories, and of course told them many exaggerated tales in return. He quickly became fascinated by their hunts, even directing adventurers to work with them in hopes of gaining information for his guidebooks.\nWhen the lost city of Omu was rediscovered, the hunters of the guild were excited to hunt for rare beasts within the ruins. During that same period, the guild contacted Port Nyanzarus Master of the Market in order to find a leatherworker who could fashion durable equipment out of manticore hide.\nAs of the late 15 century DR, notable members of the guild included\n* Agnar of Many Teeth, an expert dinosaur hunter.\n* Aryn Vasar, a hunter of undead and other abominations.\n* Desha of the Shadows, a hunter of beasts.\n* Doriak of the Shells, a hunter of giant insects and the like.\n* Mirea Sain, a seasoned huntress who acquired equipment for the guild.\n* Ragash of the Red Mist, a hunter of more intelligent prey."
