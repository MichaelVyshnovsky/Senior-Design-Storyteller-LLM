        "mainbody": "The '''Seelie Court''' (also called the Summer Court) was a pantheon of [[deity|deities]] of the [[fey]].",
        "Organization": "The Seelie Court was split into two groups, the Inner Circle and the Outer Circle. The Inner Circle was a close group of six deities who had many shared attributes. Although typically chaotic, they were loyal to Queen [[Titania]] and would do as she requested. Members of the Inner Circle tended to be playful and curious, though also cautious due to the small size of their avatars. Disputes between members of the Inner Circle were uncommon and always quickly resolved.\n\nThe Outer Circle was composed of deities who did not pay primary homage to Titania, or had duties that required them to spend time away from the Court.",
        "Members": "The members of the Inner Circle were:\n*Queen [[Titania]], leader of the pantheon. \n*King [[Oberon]], Lord of Beasts and sometime deity of the wilderness and animals.\n*[[Damh]], the son of Titania and Oberon. He was the patron of [[satyr]]s, [[korred]]s, and [[atomie]]s.\n*[[Eachthighern]], lord of [[unicorn]]s and [[pegasi]].\n*[[Sqeulaiche]], the Court Jester and patron of [[leprechaun]]s.\n*[[Verenestra]], the daughter of Titania and patroness of [[dryad]]s, [[nymph]]s, and [[sylph]]s.\n\nThe members of the Outer Circle were:\n*[[Caoimhin]], the small and shy patron god of the [[killmoulis]].\n*[[Emmantiensien]], the patron god of [[treant]]s.\n*[[Fionnghuala]], the patron goddess of the [[swanmay]]s.\n*[[Nathair Sgiathach]], the mischief-loving god of the [[faerie dragon]]s and [[pseudodragon]]s.\n*[[Skerrit]], god of the [[centaur]]s.",
        "Activities": "The Seelie Court worked together to rule the fey races of which they were patrons, and to protect the sylvan realms.",
        "Base of Operations": "The [[divine realm]] of the pantheon was also called the [[Seelie Court (divine realm)|Seelie Court]]. It moved between the planes of [[Arborea]], [[Ysgard]], and the [[Beastlands (plane)|Beastlands]] at Titania's whim.<ref>",
        "Relationships": "The Seelie Court as a whole was allied with the [[Seldarine]], and on good terms with the [[Lords of the Golden Hills|gnomish]] deities, as well as deities of nature, wild places, and hunting, so long as those deities were not evil.<ref>\n\nThe Seelie Court was opposed to the goblinoid pantheon, and they detested the hag goddess [[Cegilune]]. However, their most bitter and hated enemy was the [[Queen of Air and Darkness]]. Despite this, Titania refused to go to war with the Queen.\n\nThey did not like the dwarven gods, but they were not enemies of the [[Morndinsamman]] either.",
        "History": "The Seelie Court once held court in the land of Ladinion, by the lake Cwm Glas. However, a group of dwarven miners found a great black diamond and brought it to the court as a gift for Titania, who was not there that day. Instead, Titania's sister accepted the gift, which began to corrupt her. Eventually, that sister took the diamond away in a chariot of fire and smoke; the mountain the dwarves had been mining erupted soon after and the smoke caused sickness in the whole land. The Seelie Court itself was forced to flee."
