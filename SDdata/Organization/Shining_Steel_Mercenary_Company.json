        "History": "The Shining Steel originated as an adventuring party in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]]. When the leaders of [[Spandeliyon]] asked for their help to defend the city from a pirate horde, they recruited more members and successfully defeated the pirates.\n\nThey decided to continued to act as mercenary group but always with the approach of an adventuring party. When the [[Grand Army of the Tuigan|Horde]] menaced [[Faer√ªn]], they decided to join the crusade of [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], being hired by [[Sembia]]. During the war they fought well but were decimated. The few survivors continued on as an adventuring party."
