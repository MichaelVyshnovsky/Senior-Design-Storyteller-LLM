{{quote|''It's about the only [[pie]] in Voonlar that isn't filled with [[Zhentarim]] fingers. They'd love to control us or run us out
of business, but we bring too much [[gold]] into the [[Bron]]'s coffers in the form of taxes for them to take action. For the moment, at least...''|[[Halanther Dayne]]}}

==Activities==
The Shield Trading Company ran caravans between various cities in the Dalelands and the Moonsea, most of which either began or ended in Voonlar. The company also owned and operated the [[Sign of the Shield]], the largest and most luxurious inn in Voonlar.

==Base of Operations==
The company headquarters were located on the north side of [[Shind Road]], northeast of the intersection with [[Daerndrean Street]], in Voonlar. It was directly across the street from the Sign of the Shield. The headquarter's main hall was used as a storefront and guarded by an intimidating metal [[shield guardian]] [[golem]].

==Relationships==
The Shield Trading Company was independently owned and not under the influence of investors in league with or belonging to the Zhentarim.
