The '''Old Order''' was a prominent but mysterious monastic order in [[Faerûn]] in the early 1370s [[DR]].

==Dogma==
The Old Order was dedicated to the philosophy espoused by a certain deity, but they did not worship this deity, nor any other, apparently preferring to leave them alone.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|7}}

==Classes==
[[Monk]]s of the Old Order could cross-train as [[rogue]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[shadowdancer]]s, provided they focused on their monk training.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1370 DR]], an adventuring monk of the Old Order from Waterdeep named [[Teesha Than]] traveled through [[Deepingdale]] in the [[Dalelands]]. There she befriended the renowned [[wizard]] [[Rhauntides]]. In the [[1371 DR|Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR]], Rhauntides died and, to the surprise of all, bequeathed his tower in [[Highmoon]] to Teesha. She established a small [[monastery]] there, the first of the Old Order in the Dalelands. It was in operation by the [[1372 DR|Year of the Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. The Deepingdalesfolk were initially wary but soon warmed to them after learning the monks were good neighbors.

==Base of Operations==
Although the Old Order could be found all over Faerûn, they never had any large monasteries. From 1371 DR, they had a monastery in [[Rhauntides's Tower]] in Highmoon, Deepingdale.

Monks of the Old Order were to be found in [[Waterdeep]] in the early 1370s,{{Cite web/More of Waterdeep and Lands of Intrigue}}

==Tactics==
The monks were keenly focused on defense and resilience. It was rumored that masters of the order achieved ranks by being able to survive a beating from an [[ogre]] while never raising a hand in defense.

==Activities==
Members of the Old Order enjoyed philosophical debates and introspection.

The monks manufactured and sold their enchanted, damage-resisting ''[[robes of the Old Order]]'' to fund their monasteries. These enabled monks of many faiths and orders to survive battles.

==Notable Members==
* [[Silence-Before-Iron]], a mysterious adventuring monk member of the ''[[Annals of Halgren]]'' ''circa'' [[1310 DR]].
* [[Teesha Than]]
