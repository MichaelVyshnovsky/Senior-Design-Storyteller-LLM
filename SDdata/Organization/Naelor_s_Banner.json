All companies, Naelor's Banner included, were not bigger than 40 ex-military members in the full employment of the organization.\n\nThe company's insignia was a canary-yellow flaming [[dagger]] positioned diagonally pointing to the upper right corner on a  royal purple background.",
        "History": "By the late 15{{th}}century DR, Naelor's Banner was the best-reputed mercenary band in Murghôm, renowned for their military precision, superb discipline and over forty years of successful mercenary work."
