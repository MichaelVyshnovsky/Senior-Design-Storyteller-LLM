        "mainbody": "Naelors Banner was a mercenary company from Murgh么m, operating from Thuldan Way on the western edge of Nimjammir in the late 15 century DR.\nNaelors Banner, like all other mercenary companies of Murgh么m, was established by the countrys military veterans who were forced into hired work by the army shrinkage decreed by the Princes of Murgh么m over several decades. All companies, Naelors Banner included, were not bigger than 40 ex-military members in the full employment of the organization.\nThe companys insignia was a canary-yellow flaming dagger positioned diagonally pointing to the upper right corner on a  royal purple background.\nBy the late 15century DR, Naelors Banner was the best-reputed mercenary band in Murgh么m, renowned for their military precision, superb discipline and over forty years of successful mercenary work."
