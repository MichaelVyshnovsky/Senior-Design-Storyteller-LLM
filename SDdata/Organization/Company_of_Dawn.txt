The Company of Dawn was a mercenary company that operated out of Arabel in Cormyr during the mid–14 century DR. It was led by the gregarious but trustworthy Thurbrand of the Stonelands.
During the Time of Troubles in the , Thurbrand led the company on an ill-fated journey across Cormyr through Spiderhaunt Wood into Shadowdale. They were helping a friend of Thurbrand, Kelemvor Lyonsbane and his companions Midnight, Adon, and Cyric evade authorities from Arabel and reach the dale safely. Nearly every member of the group was slain, save for Thurbrand, Isaac, and Vogt.
After the survivors of the expedition ensured the safe arrival of the adventurers at Shadowdale, they planned their return trip to Arabel.
Members of the company included several young and inexperienced travelers, including the mage Bohaim of Suzail, the naïve Tymoran thief Brion, the teenager Gillian, along with Isaac, Vogt, Welch, Zelanz, and a cleric of Tymora.
