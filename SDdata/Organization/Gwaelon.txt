'''Gwaelon''' was an [[elven]] house of [[Myth Drannor/Cormanthor|Myth Drannor]].

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|241}}, the heir of House Gwaelon alongside half a dozen eleven house heirs, attempted to assassinate young [[Elminster Aumar]] and [[Symrustar Auglamyr]], a [[Chosen]] of [[Mystra]]. The two escaped leaving behind a statuette charged with magic. When one of the young elven lords and warriors stuck the statuettes, a fearsome explosion occurred near the [[Narnpool]]. The Gwaelon heir was killed in the explosion.
