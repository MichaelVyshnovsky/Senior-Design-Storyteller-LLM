The Order of Rainbow Monks were a religious organization found in the Hordelands.
The rainbow monks worshiped Byubo. They also helped travelers passing through the region along the treacherous route.
The Order of Rainbow Monks were based deep within the Katakoro Shan mountain range where the Gogrus and Akundi rivers met at Rainbow Falls.
