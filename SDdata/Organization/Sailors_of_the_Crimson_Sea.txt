The '''Sailors of the Crimson Sea''', or simply the '''Sailors''', were a prominent mercenary company based in [[Airspur (Chessenta)|Airspur]] in [[Chessenta]] and active in [[Chondath]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]]. Their name was a complex metaphor: "the crimson sea" referred to a bloody battlefield, upon which soldiers were the "sailors". They didn't actually fight on water.

==History==
The Sailors were formed in the 1350s [[DR]] by [[Bendix]], but since then had suffered many misfortunes.

In the 1350s DR, the Sailors of the Crimson Sea marched to the town of [[Timindar]] in Chondath, having been hired by Lord [[Reland Tymin]] to confront the dark forces of [[Yrkhetep]] at [[Thurgabanteth]]. However, while passing the edge of the [[Chondalwood]], they were ambushed by unknown enemies. Sniper archers killed Bendix and the ambushers used oil to burn his body to prevent resurrection. They even destroyed their food supply. Although the Sailors prevailed and killed all the ambushers, they were left with many wounded and dead and were in need of a [[cleric]] or priest to heal them, conjure food, and conduct funeral rites.

After sending a messenger to Timindar, acting commander [[Lhrek Jarsyn]], the mage [[Iurnan Chall]], and other veteran members of the company went into the Chondalwood in search of more food. However, after killing a [[deer]], cutting some branches, and starting a fire, they were captured by the druid [[Variath]] and his [[treant]]s, who put them on trial. The treants demanded justice, accepting an apology and a compensation of 1000 [[gp]]. However, Lhrek refused, so Variath threatened execution. Adventurers sent from Timindar may have aided their trial; they were not executed and went on to Timindar.

Soon after, the Sailors fought in the Battle of Thurgabanteth.

After a political power struggle between [[Lhrek Jarsyn]] and [[Iurnan Chall]], by [[1357 DR]] Lhrek had emerged as leader but he took Chall as his chief advisor.

They were active again in the early 1360s DR.

==Organization==
===Structure===
They had 185 members and were divided into infantry, cavalry, and archers. The infantry comprised sixty veteran [[fighter]]s and twenty less-experienced fighters, the cavalry comprised sixty less-experienced [[warrior]]s, and the archers were forty basic warriors.

Their leadership was a standard military hierarchy, with Lhrek Jarsyn as leader and Iurnan Chall as chief advisor and assistant. Beneath them were three lieutenants: [[Masoth]], who led the infantry; [[Chard]], who led the cavalry; and [[Vidad]], who led the archers. The company remained together and traveled as needed.

===Culture===
They had a generally [[lawful]] attitude. However, the tension between the leaders led to low morale,

==Base of Operations==
They operated in Chessenta and Chondath.

==Tactics==
Their tactics were sound once in battle. They were especially cautious in forests after their experiences in the Chondalwood.

==Possessions==
The infantry were equipped with [[longsword]], [[shield]], and [[plate mail]] or [[chain mail]] armor. The cavalry were equipped with [[lance]], shield, and plate mail. The archers had [[longbow]]s and [[leather armor]].

==Contracts==
They tried to work for employers with good intentions, but they never worked for free. They charged 250 [[gold piece]]s per week for their services. They would kept their side of a deal.

==Relationships==
They'd made a few enemies, but most were evil groups.
