The '''bugbear pantheon'''<ref group="note">Bugbears were noted to venerate the "bugbear pantheon" in ''[[Monster Mythology]]'', a core sourcebook. However, this article focuses on recent Realms material, specifically ''Volo's Guide to Monsters''. This sourcebook clearly states that bugbears as a race once had an individual pantheon that was dissolved by [[Maglubiyet]]. For the purposes of this wiki, the extinct pantheon is referred to as the bugbear pantheon. was an extinct [[pantheon]] whose [[deities]] were once worshiped by [[bugbear]]s.

==History==
The bugbears once had a pantheon with deities unique to their race and culture. However, many of them were cut down by [[Maglubiyet]], though the two brothers, [[Hruggek]] and [[Grankhul]] were spared. The original pantheon was absorbed into Maglubiyet's [[goblinoid pantheon]]. However, after Maglubiyet's conquest, bugbears still worshiped the two brother deities, even though it meant submitting to their conquerer's rule.

==Members==
Some known members of the pantheon were:
* Hruggek, surviving member and tyrannical deity
* Grankhul, surviving member and deity of duty

The bugbears also knew of a god of fear known as [[Skiggaret]], though it was unknown if this deity was ever part of the original bugbear pantheon or even the reformed goblinoid pantheon.
