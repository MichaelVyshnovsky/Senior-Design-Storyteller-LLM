The Maernos family retained a trio of halfling adventurers that became known as the Defenders Three.
The family coat-of-arms consisted of a pair of praying hands with green sleeves and three silver spear heads on a royal blue field.
House Maernos was primarily in the moneylending and financial services business, and specialized in assisting the various temples in Waterdeep with money matters.

The family villa and compound were located in the North Ward between Copper Street and the High Road about five blocks south of the Upper Towers. The north side of the compound faced Delzorin Street and the south side faced Sidle Street.
With no heirs, Ultas petitioned the Lords Court in 1368 DR to be allowed to bequeath his holdings and wealth to the ten major temples and the Plinth, to be equally distributed by the Lords Court. The family compound was to be converted into a temple specifically for use by the non-human residents of Waterdeep. After a closed-door session, the Magisters and the Lords Court agreed to allow his request. By this time, Ultas had already started renovating his villa, buying paintings, carvings, and sculptures by elven, dwarven, and halfling artists appropriate for a place of worship.
After Ultas passing, the Maernos compound became known as Holyhands House and was run by the Defenders Three. As of the 1490s DR, it was still in operation.
