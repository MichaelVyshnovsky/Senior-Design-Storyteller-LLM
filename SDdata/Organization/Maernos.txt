The '''Maernos''' ({{Pronounce|MAY|er|noz|refs=This occurred between [[1368 DR]] and [[1372 DR]] based on the dates of the settings of the ''[[City of Splendors (boxed set)]]'' and ''[[City of Splendors: Waterdeep]]'' publications, respectively.

==Organization==
The family patriarch was [[Ultas Maernos]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}. He was a widower, having lost his wife and children to the plague in [[Amn]] in the {{YearlinkName|1345}}.

The Maernos family retained a trio of [[halfling]] adventurers that became known as the [[Defenders Three]].{{Cite dragon/211/"I Sing a Song by the Deep-Water Bay"|34}}

The family coat-of-arms consisted of a pair of praying hands with green sleeves and three silver [[spear]] heads on a royal blue field.

==Activities==
House Maernos was primarily in the moneylending and financial services business, and specialized in assisting the various temples in Waterdeep with money matters.

In 1368 DR, Lord Maernos gave significant financial help to the newly recognized prince [[Haedrak Rhindaun III]] in his bid to rescue [[Zaranda Star]] and take over the throne of [[Tethyr]].

==Base of Operations==
[[File:Map09-Lanngolyn-Maernos-Massalan-Villas.png|thumb|right|270px|''The Maernos family compound (labeled 115), ''circa'' [[1357 DR]].'']]
The [[Maernos Villa|family villa]] and compound were located in the [[Waterdeep/North Ward|North Ward]] between [[Copper Street]] and the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]] about five blocks south of the [[Upper Towers]]. The north side of the compound faced [[Delzorin Street]] and the south side faced [[Sidle Street]].{{Cite dragon/211/"I Sing a Song by the Deep-Water Bay"|30}}

==History==
With no heirs, Ultas petitioned the [[Lord's Court]] in 1368 DR to be allowed to bequeath his holdings and wealth to the ten major temples and the [[Plinth]], to be equally distributed by the Lord's Court. The family compound was to be converted into a temple specifically for use by the non-human residents of Waterdeep. After a closed-door session, the [[Magister (Waterdeep)|Magisters]] and the Lord's Court agreed to allow his request. By this time, Ultas had already started renovating his villa, buying paintings, carvings, and sculptures by [[elf|elven]], [[dwarf|dwarven]], and halfling artists appropriate for a place of worship.

After Ultas' passing, the Maernos compound became known as [[Holyhands House]] and was run by the Defenders Three. As of the 1490s DR, it was still in operation.{{Waterdeep-time}}
