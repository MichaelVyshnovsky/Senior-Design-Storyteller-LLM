The '''jisha-bugyo''' were in charge of the how religious organizations in [[Wa]] were run. They oversaw the [[shukenja]] and other holy men to ensure that all religions followed the shogun's mandates.

There were four officials in this office, both honored by Wa's citizens, like all other officers in the shogun's government. The shogun himself approved anyone serving as jisha-bugyo.
