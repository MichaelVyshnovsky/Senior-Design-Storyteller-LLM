        "mainbody": "he Darkwater Brand was a merchant coster headquartered in Archenbridge, run by Clan Dakker and their patriarch Vzoun Dakker. They also had operations in Ordulin and Hillsfar.\nAt first glance, traders from the Darkwater exported produce and ore from Archendale and imported finished metalworking products from Glister, Thentia, and Melvaunt in the Moonsea. These business practices were just a cover for a slaving ring operated by Vzoun. While he was careful not to break the laws while in Archendale, Vzoun specialized in the kidnapping of children of wealthy Sembian merchant families.\nThe headquarter of the organization was a shop in Archenbridge, while it also maintained outposts in Hillsfar and Ordulin."
