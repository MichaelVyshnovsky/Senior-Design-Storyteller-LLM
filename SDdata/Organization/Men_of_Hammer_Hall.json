        "mainbody": "The '''Men of Hammer Hall''' was an adventuring company hailing from [[Waterdeep]] that operated in [[the North]] during the midâ€”14{{th}} century [[DR]]. They operated out of a wooden cabin, of their own construction, that they called [[Hammer Hall]].",
        "Activities": "For several years the adventurers led expeditions into the nearby [[dwarven]] settlement that fell into ruin, the [[Halls of the Hammer]]. \n\nBetween their forays underground, the company regrouped and rested in their outpost. On a number of occasions they fought off fearsome creatures, such as [[troll]]s, [[orc]]s, and even [[bugbear]]s.",
        "History": "Sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the Men of Hammer Hall ventured north and abandoned their namesake home."
