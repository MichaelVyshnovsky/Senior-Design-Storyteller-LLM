        "mainbody": "he Rightful Conspiracy was an initiative in the early 1370s DR amongst the nobility of Cormyr to overthrow Regent Alusair Obarskyr and assassinate Filfaeril Obarskyr so that a new king could ascend to the throne.\nThe Conspiracy was chaotic and porous, largely lacking in organization, with numerous members working towards different goals and some even trying to murder the others. However, the early spring meeting was held at an island chosen for its defensible position, requiring the crossing of three guard posts and two bridges to reach it.\nIn early spring of the , a meeting was joined in Marsember, where numerous merchants, local Marsembans, Cormyrean nobles, and even some Red Wizards in disguise got together to discuss a future assassination of the ruling monarchy of Cormyr and its replacement by a different king.\nIn the aftermath, the thief Narnra Shalace of Waterdeep was caught in the crossfire after accidentally following Elminster into Marsember, culminating in her being pursued for questioning afterwards. She ultimately was hired by Caladnei to scout out a number of War Wizards whod met with members of the Conspiracy.\nMore activity related to the Rightful Conspiracy followed later that year, as evidence of Sembian and Amnian backing was discovered by the War Wizards. Unfortunately for them, the magical backup they were expecting from the Red Wizards was thwarted by the sudden arrival of a flight of dragons, which included Ammaratha Cyndusk and Aeglyl Dreadclaw among others. During the fight, Queen Filfaerils teleport gem was destroyed by a young scion of the Dracohorn family, preventing their escape. However, thanks to the help of Noumea Cardellith, Filfaerils Highknights endured long enough for Glarasteer Rhauligan to arrive with reinforcements.\n* Beltrar Morgrin, War Wizard\n* Thauvas Zlorn, a.k.a. \"Khornadar of Westgate\", Red Wizard (Staranghs direct liaison with the Conspiracy), slain after the meeting\n* Amrelle Mistwind, who was just \"on her nightly manhunt\"\n* Harnrim Starangh, Red Wizard (coordinated with the Red Wizards)\n* Tharmoraera, pleasure-lass of Marsember\n* Lord Blackwinter, noble\n* A Thorntower scion\n* Sorval Maethur, assassinated during the meeting\n* Imbur Waendlar, furniture merchant\n* Thandro\n* Sauvrurn\n* Darndreth Goldsword\n* A scion of the Dracohorn family\n* Harnrim Starangh (attempted to time an attack on Vangerdahast to take advantage of the conspiracy)\n* Telarantra, War Wizard of Cormyr (attempted to assassinate Vangerdahast)"
