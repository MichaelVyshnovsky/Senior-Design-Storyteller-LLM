        "mainbody": "House Albrath was a mercantile house that hailed from the city of Ravens Bluff during the midâ€“14 century DR. Their trade involved the bulk dying of linens, laundry services and, for quite a hefty price, the discreet disposal of illicit goods, contraband and even bodies from locales throughout the Bluff.\nWhile they maintained a congenial demeanor on the surface, they were determined and razor-focused in their business dealings and acquisitions, which included a select few foreign assets.\nAs of the year 1370 DR, the family was led by their patriarch and Merchants Council representative Embro Albrath."
