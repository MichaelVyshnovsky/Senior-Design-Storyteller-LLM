'''Silvermace''' was one of the noble families of [[Cormyr]] with a spacious mansion located in [[Suzail]].

==History==
[[Theron Silvermace]] resided in his sprawling mansion in Suzail, filled with artifacts and trophies from his long life of adventuring. He shared his quarters with a [[Shou]] partner [[Kwee Chan Sen]] who found home with Theron after fleeing [[Shou Lung]] and meeting Silvermace during his adventures in the [[Hordelands]] ''circa''[[1358 DR]].

In [[1362 DR]]{{Cite web/Presenting...Seven Millennia of Realms Fiction}}, Theron Silvermace organized a disastrous expedition to [[Chult]] that ended in him returning to Suzail, broken and hurt. Soon after his return, both Theron and Kwee were murdered in their home by [[ice golem]] assassins of the [[Cult of Frost]].
