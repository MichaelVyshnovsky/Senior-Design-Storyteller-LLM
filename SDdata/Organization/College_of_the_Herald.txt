The '''College of the Herald''' was a [[bardic college]] from [[Herald's Holdfast]] that instructed the [[bard]] members of the [[Heralds of Faer√ªn]].

==Organization==
The main focus of the Heralds was to collect and preserve knowledge of ancient history, legends, heraldry, and folklore, and to make it available for those of good and peaceful intentions. For that reason, most Herald bards studied the [[Bard#College_of_Lore|College of Lore]] and practiced its methods. There was little focus on musical performance, but the library had a vast collection of songs.

==Base of Operations==
The college's main site was Herald's Holdfast, northwest of [[Silverymoon]].

==Relationships==
The Heralds were allies of the [[Harpers]], but chose to remain neutral in most conflicts in order to keep preserving knowledge as their top priority.

==History==
The college was founded at the same time the Heralds themselves were formed in [[922 DR]] by the [[Harpers|Harper]] [[Aliost Oskrunnar]].This date is in disagreement with the founding of the Heralds from ''[[The Grand History of the Realms]]'', p. 113, which states it to be [[992 DR]]. It is possible that this is a typo in the ''[[Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide]]''.
