The '''Hands of the Glade''' were an organization of [[psionic]] healers and carers operating in [[Turmish]], based out of the city of [[Gildenglade]], and active around [[1374 DR]].{{Cite web/Class Chronicles: Psionic Classes}}

==Members==
They were of various races: mostly [[elves]], [[half-elves]], and [[dwarves]], with some [[human]]s and others. However, they were all psionically gifted and of shared purpose.

==Abilities==
All of them sought to achieve the skills of a [[sangehirn]], or had already done so. Psionics was not normally regarded as a healing art, but this unique discipline was dedicated to healing others, by using mental powers to renew mind and body.

==Activities==
Wandering Turmish, the Hands of the Glade provided succor and healing to weary and hurt travelers and adventurers.
