        "History": "The Knights of the Crescent Moon was founded by Lady of the Seven Silver Stars, [[Elhanna Moonhawk]], a cleric of [[Sel没ne]], and her mate the First Axe [[Therlarn Axesong]], a powerful warrior of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]] after a divine vision sent by both their gods to face threats from the [[Lake of Steam (region)|Lake of Steam]]. In {{Yearlink|-200}}, they gathered together human clerics of Sel没ne from [[Zazesspur]] in the [[Purple Marches]] and dwarven warriors from [[Shanatar]]. They proved their valor fighting in the [[Eye Tyrant Wars]] of {{Yearlink|-170}} to {{Yearlink|-166}}, and thanks to them, the [[beholder]]s were defeated.\n\nHowever, after the victory at the [[Battle of Eyesvale]], the allied forces of [[Tethyr]], [[Mir]], [[Calimshan]], and Iltkazar disbanded, and soon the Order found itself in constant struggle with rival groups devoted to Sel没ne and to Clangeddin and involved in the  court politics of Tethyr and Iltkazar.\nAfter the power of his order started to decline in {{Yearlink|-75}}, the new leader of the Order, the [[half-dwarf]] [[Bryth Moonaxe]], consulted the [[Oracle of the Deepwash]], who gave to him a prophecy that the order should quickly disband but would also rise again in the future to fight an ancient foe.<ref>{{cite dungeon/69/Sleep of Ages|51}} So Bryth and all his fellows voluntarily underwent a ''[[Phezult's sleep of ages]]'' [[spell]].\n\nThey awoke in [[1370 DR]], 1,445 years later. Under the able leadership of Bryth, the members of the order slowly adapted to that time and tried to reforge the bond with the crown of Iltkazar. However, Bryth saw stagnation around him and spoke against it, while also asking for a war against the [[beholder]] [[Alimir Hive]]."
