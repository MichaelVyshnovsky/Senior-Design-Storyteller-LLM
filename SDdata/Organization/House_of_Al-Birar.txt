The House of Al-Birar was one of the richest merchant families in Huzuz in 1367 DR.
Through a stroke of cleverness, the House of Al-Birar employed several shairs and their marid to keep their warehouses cool enough to prevent food spoilage. Though this method was expensive, the Al-Birar family became quite rich.
The House of Al-Birar was based out of the Warehouse District of Huzuz.
Al-Birar focused on food and other potable items including wine, fruit, and meat. They supplied many of the popular restaurants and cafes in Huzuz.
