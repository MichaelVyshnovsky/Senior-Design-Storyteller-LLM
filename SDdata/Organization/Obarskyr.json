More men joined him and when the [[elves]] in the region realized they could not contain the growing number of [[human]]s invading the land they chose Ondeth to attempt to bring peace and slow down the settlement's expansion. When Ondeth died, his son Faerlthann became the first king of the realm that the elves and Ondeth had created. In the {{YearlinkName|26}} (year 1 of [[Marking the years|Cormyr Reckoning]]), Cormyr was born.",
