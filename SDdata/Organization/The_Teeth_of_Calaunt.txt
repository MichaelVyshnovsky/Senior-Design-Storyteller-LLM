'''The Teeth of Calaunt''', or simply '''The Teeth''', were the standing army of the city-state of [[Calaunt]] in [[the Vast]] in the 14th century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The Teeth numbered six thousand soldiers, twenty battle-mages, and twenty warcaptains. Each battle-mage was an apprentice of [[Merchant Duke]] [[Halabankh Ormsarr]], and two of them served each warcaptain. The warcaptains in turn answered to Barons [[Uthorn]] and [[Wenszrin]].

==Tactics==
The Teeth were poorly trained brawlers, and their captains were little better. However, they were well equipped. Each battle-mage was an [[illusionist]].

Calaunt's authorities always hired mercenary armies, known as "lances", to support the Teeth in times of war or [[orc]] assault. The barons commanded these units directly. The mercenaries did most of the actual fighting, while the Teeth conducted raids and ambushes and only entered the final stages of a battle to steal the victory.

==Activities==
The Teeth occasionally indulged in piracy in the [[Dragon Reach]] and hunting for [[orc]]s on land.

==Base==
The Teeth of Calaunt had their barracks in the [[Fortress of the Five Vultures]] in Calaunt.
