The '''Thunkers of the Thunkers''' was an adventuring party in [[Damara]] in [[1359 DR]].

==Organization==
The Thunkers of the Thunkers were three [[ranger]]s and a pair of twin brother [[dwarves]] who specialized in hunting [[giant]]s. Their experience and strategy aided them tremendously when facing giants.

==History==
The Thunkers of the Thunkers arrived on [[Toril]] from a different [[Prime Material Plane]]. Between [[1353 DR]] to 1359 DR, they wandered the [[Sword Coast]] until deciding to settle in [[Damara]] in order to find more giants to kill. They allied with the [[dwarves]] of [[Clan Hillsafar]].
