The Thunkers of the Thunkers was an adventuring party in Damara in 1359 DR.
The Thunkers of the Thunkers were three rangers and a pair of twin brother dwarves who specialized in hunting giants. Their experience and strategy aided them tremendously when facing giants.
The Thunkers of the Thunkers arrived on Toril from a different Prime Material Plane. Between 1353 DR to 1359 DR, they wandered the Sword Coast until deciding to settle in Damara in order to find more giants to kill. They allied with the dwarves of Clan Hillsafar.
