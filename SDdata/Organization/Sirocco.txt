The '''Sirocco''' were a mercenary company based in [[Anauroch]] around [[1358 DR]].

==Tactics==
The Sirocco's simple tactics consisted of waving their [[scimitar]]s over their heads and shrieking out a ululant war cry and attacking. However, they had the best desert scouts and always knew their enemy's tactics.

==Organization==
===Membership===
The Sirocco consisted of light cavalry. Nearly 30 were armed with bows.

===Contracts===
The Sirocco charged 120 [[gold piece]]s per week. Plus they wanted some luxury items and news from the greater ''[[Realms]]''. They always respected their oath, but anyone betraying them earned themselves a tireless enemy.

==History==
The Sirocco arrived in [[Faerûn]] around [[1346 DR]] from a distant southern land, perhaps even [[Zakhara]]. They fought well in the [[Shaar]] and in the [[Old Empires]] until they eventually settled in Anauroch, where they established good relationships with the [[Bedine]]. They operated as caravan guards, becoming an enemy of the [[Zhentarim]] over time.

==Members==
They were commanded by the female [[elf]] [[Hajima sitt-Nasir]].
