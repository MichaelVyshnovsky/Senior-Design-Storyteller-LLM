        "mainbody": "The '''Church of Silvanus''' was the main organization of worship of the god [[Silvanus]]. Spread throughout Faerûn and loosely organized, nevertheless the greenleaf priesthood was far stronger than people thought.",
        "Activities": "Urban worshipers of Silvanus were gardeners who tried to create a space of wilderness within the broader city. They also dispensed sweetsap drinks, such as [[maple syrup]], sweetroot brews, and mint teas, in order to attract followers. Clergy of Silvanus preached about the peace and purity of wild lands.\n\nClergy of Silvanus were expected to protect forests, plant new trees whenever possible, and banish disease. They also were friends of [[Dryads]], and were expected to seek them out and serve them whenever possible. While expected to kill only when necessary, they were fierce enemies of those who would harm the forest with axe or fire. Silvanites should use violence only when the situation or hostile enemy leaves no other option.\n\nThe most common activities of Silvanites were counteracting land clearances, brought by extensive farming or overhunting. The underlying cause of these incursions against nature were often population growth and the pressures this brought. Silvanites often tried to slow or redirect such development of civilization in order to protect nature and the sacred Balance. This even led them to sometimes covertly sponsoring brigands, or placing and selectively breeding predators to curtail human expansion. They did this secretly in order to preserve their good reputation with nearby human settlements.\n\nSilvanites aided in wildlife breeding, nursing sick animals, and replanting shrubs and trees.",
        "Rituals": "Most rituals to Silvanus take place atop a hill with a stand of ancient oak trees crowning the top. Worship of Silvanus always involves sacrifices, but never blood sacrifice, instead something wooden must be ceremonially broken and buried, but never burned. Wooden carts, wagons, or chairs were examples of items suitable for sacrifice.\n\n====Call of Oak, Ash, and Thorn====\nIn this ritual the supplicant to Silvanus gathers the leaves of Oak, Ash and Thorn trees. The leaves are then floated on still water, and Silvanus is entreated to hear the worshiper's prayer.\n\n====Vigil of Silvanus====\nFor more serious concerns, the worshiper of Silvanus can participate in a Vigil. This can be used to converse with a servant of Silvanus, or to receive godly favors or magical powers. The worshiper anoints their body with powder of crushed acorns and mistletoe leaves mixed with either rainwater or springwater. Once anointed, the supplicant must spend the night either lying down upon or in contact with a growing tree. This must take place for most of the night. In addition, some part of the supplicants bare flesh must be held in contact with green, growing moss. These requirements made moss-covered giant trees commonly used for Vigils.\n\n====Song of the Trees====\nThe Song of the Trees was one of the more powerful and holy rituals of the Silvanites. In rare moments of special favor with Silvanus, even fallen or felled trees could be restored.\n\n====Dryad Dance====\nThe Dryad Dance was another powerful and holy ritual of considerable wildness that drew out [[Dryads]] and [[Hamadryads]]. It involved considerable dancing, piping, and carousing. [[Dryads]] and [[Hamadryads]] were empowered by the dance for a month, able to to walk far away from their trees as long as the magic from the ritual lasted, although they were unable to use their <i>Charm</i> abilities while far from their trees. Dryads and their trees were revitalized and healed by the ritual. It was common for matings between humans and dryads to occur during the ritual, which caused the rapid spread of new oak trees and the birth of new dryads.\n\n====Thorncall====\nA grim ritual, this ceremony allowed thick walls of dangerous thorns to be raised out of the forest soil. The thorns had to be raised over the body of slain servant of Silvanus, or if such a servant had shed much blood in the vicinity. Sadly, this was the ritual performed the most often by Silvanites. It was used to protect the forest and wild lands from further incursion and despoliation and to protect the Balance. The thick walls of thorns were as permanent and labyrinthine as the Silvanite clergy wished. Worshipers of Silvanus, or servant creatures such as stags, if slain or harmed, could form the basis of the ritual.",
        "Holy Days": "While the Silvanites worshiped the Forest Father at all times, they had several holy days.\n\n====Greengrass====\n====Midsummer Night====\n====Highharvesttide====\n====Night the Forest Walks====\nThis festival could occur at any time of the year. During this festival, when Silvanus is restless, the forests and trees themselves move about. Streams and ravines can change and caves can appear or disappear in the forest. Forest magic is particularly strong and wild, and monsters who live in the forest become very active.",
        "Equipment": {
            "Priestly Vestments": "[[File:Chauntea and silvanus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''A priestess of [[Chauntea]] and a priest of Silvanus.'']]\nClothing for the Silvanite church was divided into ceremonial and regular dress. Ceremonial dress for both clerics and druids was a suit of armor made of overlapping leaves. The leaves could be made of metal plates, functioning as scale male, or green-tinted leather, functioning as leather armor. In addition, the Silvanite also wore green breeches and a green shirt. The outfit was completed with a large film featuring wings shaped like oak leave.\n\nIn urban areas the standard dress was simplified. A verdigrised-copper pin was worn on the breast of a priest whenever they were not involved in High Ceremonies.\n\nWhen adventuring, druids and clerics may wear their ceremonial dress, or eschew it in favor of something more inconspicuous. Silvanites could be very practical in their dress, choosing their clothing depending on the situation and mission at hand.\n\nDruids of Silvanus in wilder areas tended to wear a loose brown cloak. These cloaks were dusty and made of old hides. Each day they were adorned with feathers and carefully watered, woven-in clumps of moss. Sightings of druids and priestess of the [[Forest Father]] in such clothing has given rise to tales of wild women of the woods in many parts of Faerûn.",
            "Holy Symbols": "* [[Belled Branch]]es were holy symbols created by the druids of [[Chauntea]] and Silvanus. They took the form of a silver tree branch strung with tiny golden bells, hanging from a simple chain. Those implements were inspired by an older druidic practice of focusing magic through tree branches encrusted with mistletoe and holly, and some were known to increase the potency of divine magic.{{Cite dragon/412/Channel Divinity: Chauntea and Silvanus}}\n\n* ''[[Hamadryad egg]]s'' where white egg-shaped stones used as a [[holy symbol]] by worshipers of Silvanus. They were engraved with an oak leaf that turned green when used by a faithful to focus divine spells. Some ''hamadryad eggs'' were known to empower the casting abilities of their users, and granted them limited teleportation abilities."
        },
        "Base of Operations": "The clergy of Silvanus were spread throughout Faerûn. They were present in large communities, such as [[Waterdeep]], but tended to favor small communities. Druids were the most favored by Silvanus, especially if they lived in wild forests and in harmony with the land.\n\n====Major Centers====\nThe main center of worship of Silvanus of Faerûn was [[Old Oak Dell]] in the heart of the [[Forest of Tethir]]. This was due east of [[Mosstone]]. Another major center of worship was [[Lyon's Oak]] south of the [[River Icehilt]] in [[Impiltur]], which was rising in importance to challenge the supremacy of Old Oak Dell. Yet another major center and contender for the head of the church was the [[House of Silvanus]] on [[Ilighôn]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]], the home of the [[Emerald Enclave]] and most prominent temple of Silvanus in the area. \n\n====Other Locations====\nThe druidic enclave of [[Cedarsproke]] deep in the [[Gulthmere Forest]] was founded by druids of Silvanus.<ref> There also were large temples in [[Alaghôn]], [[Hlondeth]], [[Ormath]], [[Lachom]], [[Ormpetarr]], [[Arrabar]], and [[Reth]]. Shrines to Silvanus could be found in groves and small villages throughout the [[Vilhon Reach]]. Shrines could also be found in [[Iljak]], [[Hlath]], [[Nun]], [[Urml]], [[Ulver's Lance]], [[Banathar]],[[Dauntshield]], and [[Swordslake Creek]].\n\nThe church of Silvanus was very strong in the [[Vilhon Reach]]. These terrible diseases remained strong in the memory of folks in the Reach, with the pain of them growing the more the stories were told. Accordingly, the church of Silvanus had at least a small temple in every town and major city throughout the [[Vilhon Reach]]. Silvanite clergy advised rulers throughout the land on how to slow and stop the spread of disease. In addition, the magic users of Silvanus used their magic to purify the waters and sewers of the land, which they did free of charge.",
        "Organization": "The church of [[Silvanus]] was often called the 'greenleaf priesthood' due to their use of the oakleaf symbol of their deity. There were no knightly orders affiliated with the church of Silvanus.",
        "Members": "Both clerics and druids had a strong base in the church of Silvanus, with clerics in the urban areas and druids in the more wild lands. Silvanus showed favor on both classes, but had a preference for druids. He even had a few shaman worshipers among nomadic and barbarian tribes.",
        "Dogma": "A central creed of the Silvanites was to preserve the Balance. Fire is balanced with ice, wild water balanced with drought, and life balanced with death. The clergy of Silvanus tended to see the big picture, thinking about a given particular affected the wider balance of Faerûn. While they tended to not take sides, the clergy of Silvanus were strongly on the side of nature, which they would defend readily. This was in part because they viewed the power of civilization as encroaching on wild spaces, and they sought to balance this by siding with nature. This commitment to Balance made so Silvanites often fought for one side on one day, only to join the opposing side the other day. The greenleaf Church was unconcerned with the particular ruling families, leaders or governments of the nations around them, viewing the rise and fall of various countries with indifference. And as long as nature survived, the balance would remain.\n\nAnother part of their creed was to fight disease. Plant new flora. Stop the felling of forests.\n\nPart of the teachings of the church of Silvanus was to study nature. Silvanites were expected to learn from instruction but also make their own observations throughout their lives. The clergy of Silvanus were expected to closely observe and grow to understand the cycles of nature, the interconnection of all the living things of Faerûn, and the great balance upon which all life depended. This would enable the Silvanite clergy to plan for the long term by watching, anticipating, and quietly manipulating the wider world. Careful study and taking the long view would also help the Silvanites avoid making a mistake which would imperial or worsen the Balance. The clergy of Silvanus were very patient and took the long-run view of how to deal with challenges facing them. Greater natural knowledge, patience, and ability to anticipate were the features of a worthy follower of Silvanus. They also made Silvanites a deadly foe, thinking four steps ahead of their opponents. Silvanites were encouraged to help others see this balance and interdependence.\n\nSilvanites resorted to violence only when pressured by time or aggression.\n\nThe clergy of Silvanus worked to fight the workings and servants of [[Malar]].\n\nSeek out dryads, learn their names.",
        "Relationships": "The church had connections to several orders of rangers who served [[Mielikki]]. Also, many of the holy groves and forest pool shrines of the church were guarded by the seldom-seen priests of [[Eldath]] along with Silvanite clerics and druids.\n\nRelations between the greenleaf priesthood and the [[Emerald Enclave]] were anything but apparent, with many Silvanites elsewhere in Faerûn thinking the Enclave was too radical. The Church of Silvanus preferred a slower, more patient, and far-looking approach to dealing with threats to nature and the Balance than the more activist [[Emerald Enclave]]. However, in the [[Vilhon Reach]] political leaders were aware of the distinction between the two groups of nature followers, and did not retaliate against the Church of Silvanus for the aggression of the Enclave. Political leaders of the Reach knew that to attack the Church of Silvanus would be to invite plague and disease into their cities, as the greenleaf priesthood would cease their cleanup operations. Even townsfolk of the Reach knew that the Church of Silvanus was distinct from the Emerald Enclave. Yet the clergy of Silvanus knew that, though their methods were different, the Enclave must operate with the Forest Father's approval, else they would not be able to cast magical spells.\n\nThe greenleaf priesthood also had ties to the [[Harpers]]. The Harpers goals to stop the rise of great powers capable of reshaping Faerûn was in harmony with the Silvanite desire to defend nature and the Balance.",
        "History": "A Silvanite druid enclave named Cedarsproke was established deep in the [[Gulthmere Forest]] in the {{YearlinkName|200}}.\n\nDuring a ceremony on Midsummer's Night in the {{YearlinkName|374}} the [[House of Silvanus]] was founded on [[Ilighôn]]. It was established for powerful druids who could <i>Shapechange</i> to fly over to the island. It also was a way for the greenleaf priesthood to keep an eye on ships traveling through the area.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|522}}, the Silvanite druids of [[Ilighôn]] and [[Cedarsproke]] sent a delegation to [[Alaghôn]] in [[Turmish]] to protest the excessive logging occurring there. The druids asked such lumber operations be ceased, as the forest could not replenish itself as quickly as they were being cut down. The [[Lord of Turmish]], [[Arton Githsberry]] promised the druids he would bring the matter to discussion in an open forum, but in truth this was a delaying tactic meant to appease the druids, and no promises were exchanged. The situation had not improved by the {{YearlinkName|527}}, with the rulers of [[Turmish]] bickered amongst themselves, and the angry rhetoric of the druids steadily increasing.\n\n[[Oakengrove Abbey]], a temple to Silvanus about seventy miles west of the [[Standing Stone]] was established in the {{YearlinkName|591}}.\n\nThe Stag king of [[Tethyr]] and renowned druid [[Strohm II]] founds [[Mosstone]] in the {{YearlinkName|687}}.\n\nThe conflict between the rulers of [[Turmish]] and the church of Silvanus came to a head in the {{YearlinkName|717}}. The druids of [[Ilighôn]], calling themselves now the [[Emerald Enclave]], entered into open conflict with [[The Windlass]], a conclave of wizards who had come to power in [[Turmish]]. The Windlass, desiring to strike the druids in their base at [[Cedarsproke]], ordered a portion of their army to cross the dangerous [[Orsraun Mountains]]. On route, the Turmish army was ambushed by the [[Emerald Enclave]] and their giant allies. As this was occurring, the [[Turmish navy]] sent to attack [[Ilighôn]] was destroyed by [[Water Elementals]] that rammed the ships into the surrounding treachrous reefs. [[The Windlass]] suffered tremendous losses in these battles, with many wizards slain. The victories of the newly founded [[Emerald Enclave]] cemented their reputation as a mighty power in the region, a reputation that would endure until their decline during [[The Wailing Years]]. Following these victories, the [[Emerald Enclave]] established bases in the [[Chondalwood]] and [[Winterwood]], expanding their influence around the [[Vilhon Reach]] and demanding that nearby nations respect the forests and Balance of Silvanus.\n\nThe two surviving wizards of [[The Windlass]] resumed hostilities in the {{YearlinkName|724}}. They hoped to purge [[Ilighôn]] of the druid's influence, and prepared many spells and magic items to aid in the war effort. These magic items did not work on the sacred island, however, and [[The Windlass]] was finally destroyed and the last of the wizards slain. Some of the warriors who followed the wizards into battle were allowed to live and return to their homelands, to be able to tell the tale of their defeat to others."
