        "Activities": "These children were brought to [[enlightenment]] and schooled in various areas including warfare, discipline and administration.",
        "Organization": "Children were matched with whatever mamluk organization paired best with his or her natural talents. Mamluks were supervised by superior officers.  The [[Grand Caliph]] in [[Huzuz]] ultimately supervised all mamluks since they were technically his property. Mamluk soldiers were the most elite fighting force in Zakhara. The different mamluk groups had special facial [[tattoo]]s they used to identify members. More elaborate tattoos denoted a higher rank.  Attempts to mimic mamluk tattoos was a crime in Zakhara."
