        "mainbody": "he Platinum Cadre was an order of dragonborn knights, paladins and priests from Tymanther sworn to the service of Bahamut.\nThe main headquarters of the Platinum Cadre were located in an abandoned section of the Catacombs of Djerad Thymar. They also had an office in Lord Tuaneks manor in Ruinspoke.\nThe Platinum Cadre professed that dragonborn werent the creations of the dragons of Abeir, but instead were the ancient children of the dragon god Bahamut. As such, members of this group believed that not all dragons were evil, and actively worked to change the prejudices of the Thymari dragonborn while seeking out for good dragons, in hopes of bridging the divide between them and the dragonborn.\nEven when most of the Thymari dragonborn ridiculed the Platinum Cadre for their beliefs, in fact their members were close to truth, as the dragonborn of Abeir were actually related to the ancient dragonborn of Bahamut, although only a few older dragons knew about this relationship.\nThe Platinum Cadre also had a foothold in the village of Ruinspoke, where they were accepted by the populace and could act openly without fear of reprisal, thanks to their allegiance to Clan Jalt.\nIn 1479 DR, a priestess of the order named Nala claimed to be a priestess of Bahamut but was secretly a priestess of Tiamat. Because most dragonborn knew little about the gods of Toril, they were unable to distinguish the magic of Tiamat from that of Bahamut. Nala was working for the green dragon Skuthosiin, and her goal was to advance the plan of her master as a taaldarax of Brimstones xorvintaal by using the Cadre to his benefit.\nTiamats power enabled the knights to use their breath abilities more often than other dragonborn,\nThe Platinum Cadre took part on Vanquisher Kepeshkmolik Tarhun joint military operation against the giants on Kythorn 9. Although Nala didnt wanted them to attack at the same time the other Thymari military forces did it, because she was using magic to hinder the military effort, Balasar (a member of the Lance Defenders who became suspicious of Nala and infiltrated the Cadre to uncover her true motives) was able to convince his \"brothers-in-arms\" to join the fray, to her annoyment. The joined Thymari forces were able to drive the giants off their lands.\nAfter having uncovered some hints, Balasar exposed Nala as a tiamatan on Kythorn 16 and she fled to the Black Ash Plain and sought refuge with Skuthosiin. Patrin, a paladin of Bahamut and the leader of the order, was killed in a duel of honor with Medrash, a paladin of Torm, when Patrin refused to acknowledge that Nala was really evil. After Patrins death, a knight named Vishva took the leadership of the order. She convinced Medrash to cleanse the members of the Cadre of Tiamat power.\nNalas treachery stained what reputation the members of the Cadre may have won in the past operations, and they became victims of ostracism and open acts of violence. They respected Patrins last wishes and didnt fight back, however. Although rejected, they still wanted to participate in the operation to invade the Black Ash Plain. During the siege of Ashhold on Flamerule 5, they were put under the command of Khouryn Skulldark of the Brotherhood of the Griffon.\nWhen Khouryn Skulldark returned to Tymanther and warned them about Tchazzars plans to invade the dragonborn nation, Tarhun made Medrash the official leader of the Cadre, and sent them, alongside Balasar, Biri and Khouryn, on a mission to destroy Gestaniius and liberate High Imaskar from her forces, in the hopes the Imaskari would lend their aid to the Thymari.\nAfter the Battle of Luthcheq, Medrash became the protector of the Platinum Cadre, to ensure the Thymari didnt forget that the Cadre had fought and saved their country. Albeit reluctantly, the Cadre was acknowledged as one the best military forces Tymanther had to offer.\nIn the late years of the 1480s DR, the Platinum Cadre had slowly been accepted among Thymari society, to the point that some of the most old-fashioned and influential clans, such as Clan Verthisathurgiesh, employed the services of the Cadres priests.\n* Daardendrien Balasar (temporary member)\n* Daardendrien Medrash (official leader)\n* Nala\n* Patrin (leader until his death)\n* Vishva (second-in-command to Medrash)"
