'''House Se'Sehen''' was a tribe of [[snake]]-headed [[yuan-ti]] known for their ability to spit venom. Members of this tribe were called Se'Sehren.

==Base of Operations==
House Se'Sehen was the largest and most powerful house within the Black Jungles as of [[1372 DR]], having seized the former lands of [[House Hss'tafi]] when they disappeared in the {{YearlinkName|-320}}. This also included both the [[Pit of Vipers]] and [[Ss'inthee'ssaree]].

==Relationships==
The Se'Sehen aided [[Sseth]] during the [[deity]]'s initial rise to power when establishing the empire of [[Serpentes]] and were awarded the lands of the [[Tashalar]] basin for their efforts. The Se'Sehen counted the members of [[House Extaminos|Houses Extaminos]] and [[House Sauringar|Sauringar]] as close allies.

Members of this tribe were frequently at odds with the [[Coiled Cabal]] as both groups thought they were the rightful crafters of yuan-ti dominance in Faerûn.

The Se'Sehen clashed often with [[House Eselemas]] and [[House Jennestas]], given their land claims within the Black Jungle.

==Activities==
The Se'Sehen experimented extensively on creatures found within the Black Jungle. They created the [[ti-khana]], which served their tribe loyally.

==History==
The Se'Sehen were forced to withdraw from Tashalar in the {{YearlinkName|20}} just ten years after Sseth's disappearance. This ushered in centuries of somnolence for the tribe. Sseth's reappearance during the [[Time of Troubles]] in [[1358 DR]] reinvigorated the tribe, prompting them to forge an alliance with the [[Rundeen]] slave and trade consortium of Tashalar. The Se'Sehen exchanged exotic poisons and spices for slaves and transportation of their agents to the ports of the north, scattering their eyes across [[Faerûn]]. Among these spies were members of House Extaminos.

House Extaminos' split from House Se'Sehen occurred when a pair of strong claimants for leadership of House Se'Sehen rose to power. Instead of crippling the house with pointless civil war, the two decided to split and allow any Se'Sehen to choose which side they would follow. The claimant's group with the greater numbers would remain as House Se'Sehen, while the other would form a new house and lead his followers to a new location.
