The Courageous, or Abd al-Jari, was a group of farisan who fought for the Preachers in 1367 DR.
The Courageous were based in the fortress of Sarahin located deep within the Haunted Lands.
This group served the holy slayers of the Preachers as a source of muscle when needed.
All of the members of the Courageous were dwarves. Their commander was Mamoud ibn Asra.
