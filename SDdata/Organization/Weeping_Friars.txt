The '''Weeping Friars''' were a religious order devoted to [[Ilmater]], the Crying God, active in [[northwest Faerûn]] in the mid–14{{th}} century [[DR]].<ref group="note" name="faith">''Sojourn'' does not name which god, if any, the Weeping Friars follow. However, their name, beliefs, and practices are a close match for the [[Church of Ilmater]].

==Dogma==
They claimed to believe that there was only a finite amount of pain and suffering in the world, and the more suffering they took upon themselves, the less suffering others would have to endure. They would offer to undergo suffering on a person's behalf in exchange for money or items, usually taking the form of alcohol or trinkets.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1346 DR]], [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] traveled with the group for a while, acting as a bodyguard and companion. They were the ones who gave him the idea of traveling to [[Ten Towns]], as [[Jankin|Brother Jankin]], being drunk at the time, mentioned it as a place where rogues could find their place. When the [[quickling]] [[Tephanis]] trapped them in [[Velcuthimmorhar|Hephaestus]]'s lair, Drizzt was the one to save them. However, after the [[drow]] left the group for [[Icewind Dale]], they were tracked down by [[Roddy McGristle]], who tortured them all for Drizzt's whereabouts.

==Members==
In Drizzt Do'Urden's party there were five members in total. They were [[Mateus|Brother Mateus]], the unofficial leader; [[Jankin|Brother Jankin]], the most fanatical of the group; and [[Herschel|Brother Herschel]], of which nothing specific was written about him.
