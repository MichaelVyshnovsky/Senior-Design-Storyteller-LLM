        "mainbody": "The '''DeVillars''' family was among the most prominent noble houses of [[Ravens Bluff]] in [[the Vast]]. Their family motto was \"Let love be our guide\".",
        "Activities": "Political influence and the DeVillars family went hand in hand, and its members often served in important civic positions within Ravens Bluff. Alongside twelve other families, the DeVillars held a hereditary seat on the city's [[Council of Lords (Ravens Bluff)|Council of Lords]]. One example of the family's influence was how Lauren DeVillars personally supplied the [[Ravens Bluff Army]] with uniforms, ensuring the city's armed forces all carried her uniform design. The city found it unwise to refuse her gift. In a more direct example, [[Drake DeVillars]] eventually came to serve as the city's [[Lord Mayor]].{{Cite trumpeter/7-1}}\n\nMuch of the family's wealth came from its ownership of the [[Tempest Rose Merchant House]]. The DeVillars did not publicly make their ownership known, but it was considered something of an open secret. This vastly successful trading company was the best-connected, wealthiest, and by far the largest merchant house in Ravens Bluff. Far beyond mere trading, the Tempest Rose primarily functioned as a bank, even minting its own currency.",
        "Base of Operations": "[[DeVillars Manor]] was indisputably the grandest residence in all of Ravens Bluff, as well as [[Laurentowers]], a more discreet (yet still palatial) residence. The DeVillars also owned three estates in the area surrounding the city: [[Chanserdun House]], an enormous garden estate; [[Mriteleigh]], a large farm estate; and [[Campopegasus Hall]], a \"modest\" walled country mansion. Collectively, these properties could muster over 530 soldiers when necessary.",
        "Relationships": "The DeVillars family were, for the most part, ardent followers of [[Waukeen]]. They were also known as friends to the [[Harpers]].{{Cite organized play/LC/Eyes of the Raven|5}}\n\nAs the foremost noble house of Ravens Bluff in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], few other families could rival the DeVillars for wealth and influence. The [[Hawktalon]]s were nearly as rich as the DeVillars, but commanded far less influence. The [[Ampner]] family were chief competitors of the DeVillars in the wine trading business. Additionally, the [[Cathone]]s considered the DeVillars to be their chief rivals.{{Cite organized play/LC/Family Matters|27}}",
        "History": "Alongside the [[Moorland]] and [[Therogeon]] families, the DeVillars (then Daefihlars) were the first settlers of the site that would eventually come to be known as Ravens Bluff. They arrived in the spring of the {{YearlinkName|1222}}, bringing with them armed companies to help fend off the many dangers in this untamed region of the Vast. The nascent settlement survived, albeit in a somewhat beleaguered state, and soon other families were drawn to the area. In the {{YearlinkName|1226}}, more than a dozen more families joined the DeVillars (and the Moorlands and Therogeons). Over time, the settlement became known as Ravens Bluff.\n\nThe early history of Ravens Bluff, as it rapidly expanded into a bustling city, was fraught with odds-defying success, but also discord and instability. [[Orc]] and [[hobgoblin]] raids were common, and the city was essentially ruled by feuding noble families who directly controlled the city government. In the mid-13{{th}} century [[DR]], [[James DeVillars]], the city's Chief Alderman, personally appointed Ravens Bluff's first [[Regent of the Harbor]] to establish law and order for seaborne vessels. Another prominent early DeVillars was [[Kartha Daefihlars]], who served as Lord Treasurer ''circa'' the {{YearlinkName|1324}}.{{Cite organized play/LC/Swan Song|14}}\n\nIt was during this early period of instability, in the {{YearlinkName|1306}}, that Lauren DeVillars&mdash;future matriarch of the DeVillars family&mdash;was born to [[Malamin DeVillars|Malamin]] and [[Salinay DeVillars]].{{Cite polyhedron/147/Pillars of Ravens Bluff|23}} In the {{YearlinkName|1338}}, Lady Lauren was named high priestess of Waukeen in Ravens Bluff.{{Cite polyhedron/147/Pillars of Ravens Bluff|20}}\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1341}}, Lauren DeVillars, by then considered one of the wealthiest and most civic-minded lords of the city, convinced her fellow nobles into hosting the [[Champions Games]], a martial contest whose winner would be granted the position of Lord Mayor.{{Cite polyhedron/147/Pillars of Ravens Bluff|16}} The hosting of the Games was seen as a desperate gamble by most citizens, with many concerned that Ravens Bluff would become the domain of a ruthless [[pirate]] or [[adventurer]]. Yet Lauren DeVillars's plan worked out splendidly: the winner, [[Charles Oliver O'Kane]], turned out to be an exceptionally able and fair leader for the city. With Lady Lauren as matriarch, the DeVillars family became known not just for its incredible wealth and influence, but also its commitment to philanthropy and the city's well-being. With that said, most citizens of Ravens Bluff were devoted to Lady Lauren herself&mdash;not necessarily her extended family.\n\nLady Lauren married [[Daimler DeVillars|Lord Daimler]], and they had four children together before his passing: Drake, [[Bethany DeVillars|Bethany]], [[Chantel DeVillars|Chantel]], and [[Ramsey DeVillars|Ramsey]].&mdash;Bethany more so than Chantel.{{Cite organized play/LC/240|17}} Lauren's eldest son, Drake, chose to follow the path of a knight and served the city as a member of several knightly orders, winning great acclaim during the war against Myrkyssa Jelan.{{Cite organized play/LC/Eyes of the Raven|2}}\n\nWhen mayoral elections were held in the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, following the war against the warlord [[Myrkyssa Jelan]], the defeat of the DeVillars-backed Charles O'Kane in favor of newcomer [[Amber Lynn Thoden]] was seen as an indication, by some, that the influence of the DeVillars on city politics was waning.",
