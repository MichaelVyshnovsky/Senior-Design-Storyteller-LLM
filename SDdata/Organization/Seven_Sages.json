        "History": "These \"sons and daughters\" of the [[Faceless God]] were appointed by their deity. They ruled from their magnificent castles, commanding their own armies and answering only to their god and the [[Lotus Emperor]] in [[Nathong]]. As a group they were incredibly secretive, never using their real names. When visiting the other provinces they usually opted to fly atop giant [[Zakharan roc|rocs]] under the cover of darkness.",
        "Activities": "As vassals of their god and emperor, the Seven Sages were expected to tithe one fifth of their collected income to the [[Gate of Heaven]] each year. Those who failed to do so were quickly removed and executed in grisly fashion. Impalement and quartering were favored methods of execution."
