The Red Sashes were a vigilante group that was based in Waterdeep.
The individual cells of the Sashes, one for each ward of the city, each answered to an authority known only as "The One".
Not an impulsive or excessively violent group, the Red Sashes aimed to arrest the guilty and free the innocent, typically when the City Watch failed in these aims.
Prospective members were approached by the Red Sashes and were forced to swear a loyalty oath to "The One". These invitations were only given after approval of the member was reached after much observation. Members were not allowed to reveal any secrets of the group to outsiders and had to pay a 5 gold piece per-month membership fee.
Only a few of the Lords of Waterdeep were aware of "The Ones" true identity. These included Mirt, Kitten, Nindil, Sammereza and, before his death, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun.
