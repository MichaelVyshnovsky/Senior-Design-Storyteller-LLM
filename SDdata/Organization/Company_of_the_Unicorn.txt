The '''Company of the Unicorn''' was an adventuring troupe that was active in [[Cormyr]] sometime before [[1348 DR]].

==History==
The history of the little town of [[Eveningstar]], [[Cormyr]], and its [[Haunted Halls]] was known for several great battles between adventuring companies and various unsavory organizations that used the Halls for their purposes. One such battle took place sometime before the {{YearlinkName|1348}}. The battle was a bombastic ''[[fireball]]''-filled struggle between the Company of the Unicorn and a group of nine mysterious levitating [[wizard]]s adorned in black robes. The combat took place in front of the Haunted Halls' entrance.
