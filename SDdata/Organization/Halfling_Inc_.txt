Halfling Inc. was an all-halfling adventuring company based around the Sea of Fallen Stars.
Halfling Inc. were notorious for their adventures and their scams, often taking advantage of gullible and greedy Large Folk. Their signature prank was giving a gem-bag full of rocks to humans. They supported the idea of halflings as dangerously clever individuals, but they were also capable of heroism when no other option was possible.
Before 1357 DR, Halfling Inc. had removed the beholderÂ Xall from the Haunted Halls of Eveningstar and destroyed a gate to the Lower planes in Westgate.
In addition to the five core members listed below, other halflings often joined for a mission or a series of adventures. The group was also known to use humans and other races as agents, or temporarily join larger adventuring companies.
