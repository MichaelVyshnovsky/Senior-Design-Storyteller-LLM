The '''Yio Dufong''', nicknamed '''"the bears"''', were a powerful [[yakuza]] clan based in the town of [[T'o na'Chee]] in [[Koryo]] in the midâ€“14{{th}} century [[DR]].

For many years, the Yio Dufong possessed the ''[[standing bear]]'', a potent magical chalice that granted those who drank from it the strength of a [[bear]]. All the Yio Dufong would imbibe before a fight, and for this reason they were called the "bears".

However, the ''standing bear'' was later stolen and by [[1357 DR]] had still not turned up.
