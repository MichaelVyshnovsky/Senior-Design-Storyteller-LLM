The Yio Dufong, nicknamed "the bears", were a powerful yakuza clan based in the town of To naChee in Koryo in the midâ€“14 century DR.
For many years, the Yio Dufong possessed the standing bear, a potent magical chalice that granted those who drank from it the strength of a bear. All the Yio Dufong would imbibe before a fight, and for this reason they were called the "bears".
However, the standing bear was later stolen and by 1357 DR had still not turned up.
