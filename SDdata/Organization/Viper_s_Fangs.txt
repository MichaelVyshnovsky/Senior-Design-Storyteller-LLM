The '''Viper's Fangs''' was a secret order of [[assassin]]s, spies, and thugs devoted to [[Sseth]], the World Serpent.

==Activities==
Members of this organization infiltrated noble houses, mercenary companies, trading costers, government agencies, and adventuring groups across [[Faer√ªn]]. Their primary role was to serve as critical information gatherers for the [[yuan-ti]] nation, but the Viper's Fangs occasionally eliminated threats as well.

==Organization==
The Viper's Fangs were composed of [[human]]s and [[yuan-ti pureblood]]s. They referred to themselves as Vipers.
