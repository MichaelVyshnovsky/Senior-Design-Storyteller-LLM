The Vipers Fangs was a secret order of assassins, spies, and thugs devoted to Sseth, the World Serpent.
Members of this organization infiltrated noble houses, mercenary companies, trading costers, government agencies, and adventuring groups across Faer√ªn. Their primary role was to serve as critical information gatherers for the yuan-ti nation, but the Vipers Fangs occasionally eliminated threats as well.
The Vipers Fangs were composed of humans and yuan-ti purebloods. They referred to themselves as Vipers.
