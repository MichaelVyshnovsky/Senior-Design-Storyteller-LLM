        "mainbody": "The Red Plumes was a mercenary army of warriors that operated directly under the will of First Lord Maalthiir. They enforced his will within the walls of Hillsfar, even going so far as to harass its inhabitants, while regularly extorting them, in order to maintain a fear of his authority. They understood their limits however, never going as far as to warrant complaints that could be overheard by the First Lord.\nAlong with guarding the city, patrols of the Red Plumes could often be found keeping an eye open for monsters, members of the Zhentarim, or other threats.\nRed Plumes were driven out of Hillsfar in 1376 DR by forces from Zhentil Keep. However, after three years of chaos, Maalthiir returned with a new force of Red Plumes and took back the rulership of the city. As of 1460 DR, Red Plumes maintained their presence in Hillsfar. \n* Jorgen Berginblade, general of the Red Plumes\n* Dounalis Guff, chaplain of the Red Plumes\n* Serag Kull, a captain within the ranks of the Red Plumes\n* Kindon Marstel, a captain of the Red Plumes during their expulsion from Hillsfar\n* Hekman Odelmor, a captain of the Red Plumes during their expulsion from Hillsfar\n* Roi Uxio, a soldier with an addiction to silkroot\n* Zerna, a wizard in service to Captain Odelmor"
