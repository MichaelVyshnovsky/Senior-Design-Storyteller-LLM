There were constant rumors that they would meet in secret and plot against the magocracy of [[Netyarch]] [[Zalathorm Kirkson|Zalathorm]]. These rumors circled around pulling power away from the Council and  shifting the faith of Halruaa from [[Mystra]] and [[Azuth]] and installing the nationwide worship of [[Shar]].\n\nThere were opposing rumors regarding the shadow wizards and [[Conclave (Halruaa)|the Conclave]]. Some believed these secret groups to be working against one another, while others conjectured they were one and the same and that their respective actions were guided by an external power for the same cause. Regardless of the truth, most [[Halruaan (ethnicity)|Halruaan]]s felt all this speculation was encouraged by both groups to politically out-maneuver one another and the [[wizard]]s of Halruaa overall."
