        "mainbody": "he shadow wizards were a supposed group of elders within the Council of Halruaa that practiced magic from the Shadow Weave circa 1372 DR. There were constant rumors that they would meet in secret and plot against the magocracy of Netyarch Zalathorm. These rumors circled around pulling power away from the Council and  shifting the faith of Halruaa from Mystra and Azuth and installing the nationwide worship of Shar.\nThere were opposing rumors regarding the shadow wizards and the Conclave. Some believed these secret groups to be working against one another, while others conjectured they were one and the same and that their respective actions were guided by an external power for the same cause. Regardless of the truth, most Halruaans felt all this speculation was encouraged by both groups to politically out-maneuver one another and the wizards of Halruaa overall."
