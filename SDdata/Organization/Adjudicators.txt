The '''Adjudicators''' (''Schatjamaetrish'' in [[Tymantheran (dialect)|Tymantheran]]) were an organization of [[dragonborn]] soldiers gathered from every [[Thymari#Clans|clan]], who served as the police force of [[Djerad Thymar]] under the direct command of the [[Vanquisher]]. When there was a crime a dragonborn clan could not handle on their own, it was the duty of the Adjudicators to take care of it.

Members of the Adjudicators used golden beads beneath their eyes as piercings, mimicking the same kind of piercings used by the Vanquisher.
