        "mainbody": "The Lost were a group of wood elves that lived in the Border Forest during the Age of Humanity and the Era of Upheaval. They were isolationist in nature, foregoing the wondrous isle of Evermeet for their ancestral home in the Dalelands.\nWhen human forces expanded logging operations in the Tesh Valley, the woodlands that came to be known as the Border Forest were separated from the larger forest of Cormanthor. The isolated elves retreated deeper into the forest, separated from their kin.\nOne of the wood elves, Raunaeril the Rose, continued to maintain a relationship with the Dalesfolk.\nWhen Zhent forces took hold in the area around the Border Forest in 1330 DR, the elves cut off all contact with the outside world and came to be known as \"the Lost\".\nIn 1369 DR a group of adventurers came to the Border Forest, in an effort to free Snowmantle from the grip of the combined forces of the Zhentilar army and the more-nefarious Zhentarim agents. Upon their arrival they met the keeper of knowledge for the Lost. This wise old wood elf Tanseril, happened to also be the father of Raunaeril and grandfather of the recently imprisoned Lanseril (whom he regarded as \"the half-breed\"). While he couldnt allow any of his kin to leave their home, the ancient lorekeeper aided the adventurers in their efforts to save his grandchild by giving them a scroll of conjure nature elemental."
