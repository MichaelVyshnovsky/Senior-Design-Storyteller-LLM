The Star Protective Services&mdashformerly known as Star Company, Protective Services Extraordinaire or, simply, the Company of the Star&mdashwas a band of adventurers that was led by Zaranda Star before she became queen of Tethyr. The band gained notoriety for their combat teachings.
After about a year, the organization had grown to include roughly 200 members, selected from the very best of the trainees from among the many villages of Tethyr. When Zaranda was absent, Shield of Innocence served as commander of the group.
After they were arrested in Zazesspur by Baron Faneuil Hardisty in 1366 DR and subsequently escaped, the group lived with the peasants in the surrounding hills and dales, teaching many of the villages in northern and central Tethyr how to defend themselves against attacks from bandits. This caused some of the figures in power to interpret their actions as training an army.
Because of conflicts among the leaders of the group as to its direction, Zaranda quit in the autumn of 1366. The others hired her back with a more explicit contract regarding her role, powers, and duties.
The mercenary Balmeric, who had been hired as leader of Zarandas caravan guards, quit soon after this, and Zaranda hired all his men. He then traveled to Waterdeep to seek new employment.
In the , Star Company was stationed outside the city of Ithmong, in an attempt to encourage the city to lower its tolls on the Ithal Bridge and the River Ith.
