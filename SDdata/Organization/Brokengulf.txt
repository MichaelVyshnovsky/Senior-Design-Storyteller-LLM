The family owned a [[Brokengulf Villa|villa]] in the [[Waterdeep/Sea Ward|Sea Ward]], on the south side of [[Wrightstone Street]] between [[Diamond Street]] and [[Mendever Street]].

==History==
House Brokengulf was ennobled in the {{YearlinkName|1248}} when the [[Lords of Waterdeep]] recognized the various merchant families as nobility within the city and its realm.{{Cite web enhancement/Noble Houses of Waterdeep|2}}

The Brokengulfs nearly went bankrupt after losing a great amount of their wealth to the [[dragon aging|ancient]] [[green dragon]], [[Claugiyliamatar]], following an elaborate ruse she played on the family's patriarch, [[Saerlin Brokengulf|Lord Saerlin]]. When she confronted Saerlin with blackmail, and he in turn sought out a dragonslayer, the great wyrm collapsed the tower of the Brokengulf villa upon him, crippling the lord and killing three of his sisters.{{Cite dragon/233/Wyrms of the North: Claugiyliamatar}}

Following the death of Lord Morus Brokengulf I, Morus II returned from the [[Sword Coast]] to the family's estate in the Sea Ward{{Cite web enhancement/Dungeon 128 Map and Handout Supplement|9}}
