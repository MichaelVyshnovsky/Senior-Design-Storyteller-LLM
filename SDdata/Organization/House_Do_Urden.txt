House DoUrden, also known by its ancient and formal name, Daermon Nashezbaernon, The house was reformed as the eighth house in 1484 DR by Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre.
The DoUrden compound was located in the district of West Wall in Menzoberranzan. It was in fact built into the wall, with stalagmites forming the posts for the main gate.
The two-level cave complex housed most of the houses residents. The first level featured a maze of tunnels, residences, training grounds, and a two-story chapel along the back wall. No stairs led to the upper level, restricting entrance only to nobles (who had levitation abilities), who could enter through the chapel or front balcony.
The ruling family lived within a set of suites on the upper level. The patron lived in a two-room suite, and the weapon masters three-room suite included private quarters, a training area, and the houses war room.
After the house was destroyed in 1339 DR, the compound remained in ruins for more than a century. House Barrison DelArmgo and House Melarn used the ruins as training grounds for their troops until 1484 DR, Quenthel Baenre ordered Bregan Daerthe to clear the grounds in preparation for the houses restoration.
