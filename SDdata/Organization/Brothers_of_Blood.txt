The '''Brothers of Blood''' were a group of [[crusader]]s devoted to [[Garagos]] dedicated to crushing his enemies. 

==Activities==
Much of the Brothers of Blood's time was spent attacking the faithful of [[Tempus]], Garagos' sworn enemy. As such, the crusaders in the organization tended to live short bloody lives.
