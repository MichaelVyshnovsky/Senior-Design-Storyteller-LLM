Though not a member, Quelzard, a greater doppelganger, "patronized" the Company throughout their career, arranging fortuitous events that ensured the partys survival so that Quelzard could continue to subtly profit from their adventures.
The Company of Crazed Venturers was present at the famed bard Mintipers performance in Neverwinter sometime in the early-to-mid 14 century DR, during which he performed several songs, including Winterwillow, Thorn of Rose, Blood of My Sisters, Stone Fall, Tree Rise, Greenhallow Mantle, Knights on the Ride, Laeryns Lament, and My Love Green and Growing.
