The hippogriff cavalry served as an elite military unit for Huzuz, the City of Delights, in 1367 DR.
The hippogriff cavalry consisted of well-trained soldiers who specialized in riding hippogriffs in combat scenarios. Though this unit could provide a tremendous aerial advantage during attack, since the threat of attack against Huzuz was extremely rare, their primary focus was to look good and impress anyone who viewed them.
There were 250 fully trained members and mounts of the cavalry broken into five wings of 50 members each. An additional 100 members and mounts were in training and could be called upon if needed.
This unit was active within, and above, Huzuz.
Prince Cheddah al-Assad was the ultimate commander of the hippogriff cavalry.
