The '''Greycloaks''' were an [[elf|elven]] organization based in [[Evereska]] for at least 250 years, from the 13{{th}} to the late 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. They were likely associated with the [[Greycloak Hills]], which encircled and protected the elven fortress home.{{Speculation}}

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1221}}, the Greycloaks forged a [[Erevain's broad sword|magical broadsword]]; such heavy blades were a rare sight among the elves, so it was quite unusual. It came to be wielded by [[Erevain Blacksheaf]], an [[elf]] [[adventurer]] who traveled to [[Icewind Dale]] and died there in the {{YearlinkName|1281}}.

When the [[iron crisis]] afflicted the [[Sword Coast]] in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the Greycloaks sent their agent Xan to investigate the situation.

==Notable Members==
* [[Xan]], a [[wizard]] and companion of [[Abdel Adrian]].
* [[Zenith Feur'sel]], a cleric of the [[light domain]] who was slain by cultists of [[the Absolute]].
