        "mainbody": "he Ironfell Council was the governing body of the Warlock Knights of Vaasa, and thus the rulers of Vaasa, in the late 15 century DR.\nThe council was made up of thirteen members. Among them were the twelve most powerful members of the Warlock Knights who had attained the rank of Vindicator, meaning they were powerful land-owning feudal nobles with their own standing armies and to whom lesser-ranked Knights swore their allegiance. The final member of the council, and also its leader, was the mysterious and long-lived founder of the Warlock Knights known only as the Voice of Telos.\nThe Ironfell Council was the undisputed pinnacle of Vaasas feudal hierarchy, and one of its primary duties was to perpetuate this hierarchy by allocating land and vassals to Warlock Knights as they ascended the orders ranks. The council held the power to conscript its citizens into military service, including high ranking Knights and their entire armies.\nIf someone killed a Warlock Knight, the Ironfell Council declared them to be an enemy of the state, and issued a death warrant that alerted every Warlock Knight and shardsoul in Vaasa to kill the offender.\nThe council met five days out of every month at the Citadel of the Iron Sky in Telos City to debate and decide issues of government. Although each Knight-Councilor had a suite of rooms to themselves in the Citadel, they preferred to come together as little as possible, and instead spend time in the lands which they individually ruled directly.\nThe council was named in honor of ironfell, a magical metal harvested from the primordial Telos which granted the Warlock Knights many of their powers.\nIn the , the ruined Castle Perilous shed its crumbling exterior to reveal a rejuvenated and evil-looking fortress beneath. Concerned, the Ironfell Council sent agents to investigate the ruin, as well as to seek out any other evidence of related threats to their power. One of the councilors, Knight-Vindicator Mansard Kanaoth, began trying to capitalize on these developments to undermine the Voice of Telos with the goal of ultimately declaring himself a successor to the Witch-King.\n* The Voice of Telos, the thirteenth member of the council and de facto leader.\n* Mansard Kanaoth, the only half-orc on the council and the most vocal detractor of the Voice."
