        "Relationships": "Members of the Unseelie Court wholly opposed the [[Seelie Court]], and as could be expected, were detested by them in kind.\n\nThe relationship between the two ruling bodies was outlined in the eleven-book series, ''[[Tales From the Gloaming Court]]''.",
        "History": "While the origins of the Unseelie Court remained a mystery, it along with Unseelie Court, attracted countless number of [[fey]] throughout its existence.\n\nMembers of the Unseelie Court were responsible for catching and raising the wild [[displacer beast]]s of the Feywild and breeding them to become terrible hunters. After some time, the monstrous beasts escaped captivity and went back to the wilds.\n\nAt some point, members of the Court attempted to seize the [[elven]] city [[Iliyanbruen]], but were repeatedly thwarted by the hero [[Celadaine]].",

            "Dark Hunt": "One of the more notable groups within the Unseelie Court was the Dark Hunt, also known as the [[Wild Hunt (disambiguation)|Wild Hunt]] after the phenomenon in which they participated. This group was a loose organization of the most skillful hunters among the Unseelie. The Queen sent them on all manner of missions to fetch various things or creatures for her entertainment, and they were expected to obey her commands without question.{{Cite web/Fey Feature/The Dark Hunters}}  \n\nAlthough mainly composed of fey, extremely skilled non-fey were sometimes permitted to join the Dark Hunt, such as its last known leader, an [[elf]] called Ice.{{Cite web/Fey Feature/The Darkest Hunter}}",
