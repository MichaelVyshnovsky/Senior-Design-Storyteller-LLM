        "mainbody": "'''Weavespinners''' were some of [[Mystra]]'s secret servants.",
        "Activities": "Weavespinners were charged with containing [[dead magic]] or [[wild magic]] areas, recharging magical items, and hiding magic where it would be found and used. They also worked against those who would slay mages, who hoarded too many magical items, and slew monsters such as [[magebane]]s, [[nishruu]], [[hakeashar]], [[disenchanter]]s, [[magedoom]]s and other eaters of magic.\n\nVeteran weavespinners also hosted and organized [[magefair]]s, under the direction of the formal hosts, the clergy of [[Mystra]].\n\nThey also solved mysteries.",
        "Organization": "They were not a formal army, and lacked ranks, which granted them flexibility at the cost of focus.",
        "Relationships": "The clergy of [[Mystra]], and many wizards, were critical of their authority to spread word of the [[magefair]]s and their authority to spread information about it.\n\nThey often worked closely together with the [[Touched]] and the [[Chosen of Mystra]].",
        "Powers": "[[Mystra]] granted weavespinners the ability to create a glow in their palms through a gesture, which identified them to each other. As of {{yearlink|1370}}, there was no known way to fake this.\n\nAll weavespinners were mages; on becoming a weavespinner, they gained the ability to ''[[locate object]]s'' at will, and could tell at a glance how old an enchantment was, or whether any untriggered magic yet remained somewhere. They could ''[[identify]]'' any item in 10 minutes. As they progressed to a sufficient level, they began gaining immunities to almost all magic, reaching finally the point of untouchability by any spell that a wizard not yet deserving of the title could cast.\n\nThey also gained the ability to recharge magical items, at the cost of other magic, and their own bodies.\n\nWeavespinners could spend a year studying a spell closely enough, and develop the ability to ''augment'' or ''inhibit'' it in a number of ways, altering its targets, power, or duration. These alterations could be even more radical than that in some rare cases, for instance, allowing an ''[[antimagic field]]'' to reach out with a \"finger\" of small volume well beyond its limits.\n\nWeavespinners who exceeded well enough the limits of most mortal magic gained the ability to cross any magical ward or barrier unharmed."
