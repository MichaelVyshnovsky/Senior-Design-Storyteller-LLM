        "Dogma": "The church of Mystra typically did not employ idols like statues of the goddess, but had no commandments against it.",
        "Activities": "The church apparently sent out communiqués to its members with news of the opening of new temples and such.\n\nThe church also found a duty to help folk driven insane by failed spellcasting.\n\nMany Mystran clergy wandered the land as itinerant clerics, seeking out and preserving old magic.\n\nThe church of Mystra preserved magical lore so that magic would continue and flourish in the future even if the dominant races of [[Faerûn]] were to fall. Its members also searched out those skilled in magic or who had the potential to use it, keeping a close eye on those who were likely to become skilled. Her [[cleric]]s were encouraged to explore magical theory and create new spells and magic items. Sites dedicated to the goddess were enhanced by the [[Weave]] to allow any spell cast by her clerics while in them to be affected by [[metamagic]].",

They had superiors among the settled clergy at the temples.",

            "Wedding Ceremonies": "The Mystran weddings were known for being short and simple with little fanfare. It allowed for small groups of guests and always at least one witness of the union. The ceremony was reformed by a [[wizard]] devotee of The Mother of Magic or one of her priests. If no clergy members were available, the ritual could be performed by an elder confidant of both newlyweds who prepared the Ring. The ceremony started with the officiator uttering the following words: \"In the name of Mystra, be welcome.\" This greeting was followed by striking a bell or a [[gong]] (deeper tones preferred). After the toll, newlyweds were escorted to the clergy person performing the wedding one at a time. The escorts were carrying sources of light, mundane or magical, while the newlyweds carried Mystra's stars. Usually, the brides' or grooms' loved ones, most commonly their parents, were the escorts. The bride and groom were dressed in their best finery of no particular style.\n\nThe aforementioned Ring was a circle drawn on the ground where the newlyweds were to stand after being escorted to the officiator. It was decorated with seven blue-white stars. The design left two gaps between the stars where two new ones were added during the ceremony, symbolizing the union in Mystra's eyes. In the ceremonies lacking \"[[the Art]]\" users, the stars were made out of paper, while when mages or clerics were present, these glowing stars were conjured through magic, reminiscent of Mystra's ''[[holy symbol]]''.\n\nWhen the newlyweds reached the Ring, escorts extinguished their lights and stepped aside. The officiator continued saying: \"In the name of Mystra, be welcome,\" to which the newlyweds responded with, \"In the name of Mystra.\" Following the greeting, they tipped forward and lowered stars of Mystra onto the Ring's gaps. Then, the newlyweds faced each other and answered the question: \"Do you wish to become one?\" As both confirmations were voiced, the officiator concluded with: \"Before Mystra, these two desire to become one.\" \n\nAfter this, two newlyweds rose up in the air through ''[[levitation]]'' or ''[[fly]]ing'' spells if possible. This was known as the \"touch of grace,\" during which the newlyweds recited their vows, embraced, and kissed. Typically the votes were recited one at a time, traditionally starting with the older partner. \"I am (full name), and I give myself to you,\" was the final promise, followed by kissing of their own fingertips, then extending the kissed palm out and upright towards each other. Both parties moved closer, first locking kissed palms. Then the officiator announced, \"The blessing of Mystra, Our Lady of Mysteries, be upon this union. Laugh together, and work magic together, and be greater thereby,\" with a wizard's [[wand]] lifted up in the air. The officiator then stepped out of the Ring, and the couple locked lips.{{Cite web/theedverse/2022-09-27 - Mystran Wedding Ceremonies}}",
