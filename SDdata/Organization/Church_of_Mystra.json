        "mainbody": "The Church of Mystra, also known as the Church of Mysteries and by other names, was the primary religious organization dedicated to the worship and service of the goddess of magic, Mystra, or her successor, Mystra.\nThe church of Mystra typically did not employ idols like statues of the goddess, but had no commandments against it.\nThe church apparently sent out communiqués to its members with news of the opening of new temples and such.\nThe church also found a duty to help folk driven insane by failed spellcasting.\nMany Mystran clergy wandered the land as itinerant clerics, seeking out and preserving old magic.\nThe church of Mystra preserved magical lore so that magic would continue and flourish in the future even if the dominant races of Faerûn were to fall. Its members also searched out those skilled in magic or who had the potential to use it, keeping a close eye on those who were likely to become skilled. Her clerics were encouraged to explore magical theory and create new spells and magic items. Sites dedicated to the goddess were enhanced by the Weave to allow any spell cast by her clerics while in them to be affected by metamagic.\nthumb|right|150px|A cleric of Mystra in blue robes wearing her holy symbol.\nFrom 1358 DR, the patriarch of the church was Adon, who had been the first priest of the new Mystra.\nEven itinerant clerics like Tunaster Dranik would remain in at least yearly contact with the church, and be considered to be in good standing. They had superiors among the settled clergy at the temples.\nOne Mystran religious service took the form of an astronomy show, in which a priest pointed out, named, and revered various stars and constellations.\nThe Plea for Guidance was a simple prayer that was known to all devotees of Mystra. The clerics of the Lady of Mystery taught it to anyone who cared enough to learn it. The prayer was uttered while kneeling into the nearest lit candle or a visible star. The Plea was often evoked when followers Mystra faced with unknown magic or uncertainties of signs and dreams that their deity couldve sent.\nThe Mystran weddings were known for being short and simple with little fanfare. It allowed for small groups of guests and always at least one witness of the union. The ceremony was reformed by a wizard devotee of The Mother of Magic or one of her priests. If no clergy members were available, the ritual could be performed by an elder confidant of both newlyweds who prepared the Ring. The ceremony started with the officiator uttering the following words \"In the name of Mystra, be welcome.\" This greeting was followed by striking a bell or a gong (deeper tones preferred). After the toll, newlyweds were escorted to the clergy person performing the wedding one at a time. The escorts were carrying sources of light, mundane or magical, while the newlyweds carried Mystras stars. Usually, the brides or grooms loved ones, most commonly their parents, were the escorts. The bride and groom were dressed in their best finery of no particular style.\nThe aforementioned Ring was a circle drawn on the ground where the newlyweds were to stand after being escorted to the officiator. It was decorated with seven blue-white stars. The design left two gaps between the stars where two new ones were added during the ceremony, symbolizing the union in Mystras eyes. In the ceremonies lacking \"the Art\" users, the stars were made out of paper, while when mages or clerics were present, these glowing stars were conjured through magic, reminiscent of Mystras holy symbol.\nWhen the newlyweds reached the Ring, escorts extinguished their lights and stepped aside. The officiator continued saying \"In the name of Mystra, be welcome,\" to which the newlyweds responded with, \"In the name of Mystra.\" Following the greeting, they tipped forward and lowered stars of Mystra onto the Rings gaps. Then, the newlyweds faced each other and answered the question \"Do you wish to become one?\" As both confirmations were voiced, the officiator concluded with \"Before Mystra, these two desire to become one.\" \nAfter this, two newlyweds rose up in the air through levitation or flying spells if possible. This was known as the \"touch of grace,\" during which the newlyweds recited their vows, embraced, and kissed. Typically the votes were recited one at a time, traditionally starting with the older partner. \"I am (full name), and I give myself to you,\" was the final promise, followed by kissing of their own fingertips, then extending the kissed palm out and upright towards each other. Both parties moved closer, first locking kissed palms. Then the officiator announced, \"The blessing of Mystra, Our Lady of Mysteries, be upon this union. Laugh together, and work magic together, and be greater thereby,\" with a wizards wand lifted up in the air. The officiator then stepped out of the Ring, and the couple locked lips.\n*Lady Day, the annual spring multi-day festival, most prominently celebrated in Halruaa. The festivities ended in a grand magically illuminated skyship regatta above the waters of Lake Halruaa.\nThe Flame Blade was a magical artifact that once belonged to the Sisterhood of Silver Fire. The enchanted short sword usable only by Mystras clerics. It was shaped like the Lady of Mysterys holy symbol and engulfed in her silver flames.\nBy 1374 DR, the kingdom of Cormyr did not have even one temple to Mystra. In that year, a Temple of Mystra was constructed in Wheloon, but it turned out to be a false temple run by cultists of Shar and Cyric.\nThe Church of Mystra was opposed to the church of Cyric, just as Mystra was opposed to Cyric.\n* Children of the Starry Quill\n* Order of the Blue Moon\n* Order of the Shooting Star\n* Knights of the Mystic Fire\n* Sisterhood of Silver Fire"
