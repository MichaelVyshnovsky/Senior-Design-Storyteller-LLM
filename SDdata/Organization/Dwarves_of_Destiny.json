        "History": "In [[Eleint]] of the {{YearlinkName|1361}}, the Dwarves of Destiny went into the [[Underdark]] in search of the lost [[Mielikkian]] [[treespeaker]] [[Elanalue Sharrith]], who'd been captured by [[drow]] and taken into slavery years earlier, in the {{YearlinkName|1335}}. The holy Mielikkian [[spellbook]] known as ''[[Yornar's Trail Companion]]'' had gone missing with her. But the Dwarves of Destiny, like five other adventuring companies before them, had not returned as of [[1368 DR]]."
