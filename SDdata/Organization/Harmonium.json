        "mainbody": "The '''Harmonium''', nicknamed the '''Hardheads''', was the faction of [[Sigil]] that maintained peace and order within the city. \n\n{{Quote|Peace is our goal. But if it takes a little war to get others to set things right, the ''Harmonium'' way, so be it.|Excerpt of Harmonium doctrine.}}",
        "Outlook": "The Harmonium believed there was inherent order to the [[multiverse]], a ''universal harmony'' that was best upheld by brutal force and strict adherence to the word of law.",
        "Activities": {
            "Training": "Harmonium members underwent an eight-week indoctrination regimen. This process included exhaustive physical training, strict memorization of [[Book of the Harmonium|Harmonium doctrine]], approximate familiarization with [[The Sigil Municipal Code|Sigil's municipal laws]], and rigorous evaluations that involved being blindfolded and abandoned within the city."
        },
        "Tactics": "[[File:Hardhead.png|thumb|right|300px|''A hard-headed member of the Harmonium.'']]\n{{Quote|Accept peace, or consider yourself at war with the Harmonium. Our might will make right.|[[Factol]] [[Sarin]], excerpt from a Harmonium indoctrination session.}}\n\nIn addition to typical law enforcement techniques, They were granted authority to destroy any written material that was created and distributed without their prior approval.",
        "Possessions": "Harmonium patrols carried with them ''[[planar mancatcher]]s'', [[pole arm]]-like devices that inhibited inter-planar travel and transportation.",
        "Relationships": "Among the other factions of Sigil, the Harmonium were openly opposed by the [[Bleak Cabal]] and the [[Fated]]. They were however kept in check by Sigil's [[Doomguard]], which controlled the city's armory. By limiting access to weaponry, the Doomguard prevented the Harmonium starting outright war in the name of peace.",
        "History": "The Harmonium was founded on a world called [[Ortho]] by a band of [[adventurer]]s that sought to bring peace and law to the land. After finding inexplicable success in this endeavor, the group reformed as the Harmonium and expanded their ambitions. Harmonium law eventually spread across the entire world. Every [[humanoid]] race that survived Harmonium expansion enjoyed peaceful, regimented, and delightfully oppressive lives, free from trouble-making [[fey]] creatures like [[elves]] or [[pixie]]s. The sacrifice of joy and happiness was but a small price to pay. \n\nWhen occasional eruptions of disorder and anarchy emerged, Harmonium leadership believed some force beyond their world was responsible. They established their faction in Sigil, and used the City of Doors as a staging point, from which they could stamp out disorder across every [[planet]] and [[plane of existence]]."
