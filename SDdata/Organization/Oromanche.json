        "mainbody": "Oromanche was a wealthy merchant family from the walled town of Mosstone that laid along the Trade Way in Tethyr.\nThe Oromanche family was known to be bombastic and flamboyant people. They had \"dark, lush good looks,\" were bold and daring, and had whirlwinds of alleged and real romances and trysts around the Houses reputation. Maerele Oromanche was the matriarch of the merchant family circa 1449 DR. She was good friends with Elminster Aumar. Maerele Oromanche had three significantly younger siblings involved in the familys trade Elklund, Imraphar, and Odyle. Other siblings included Olora, Emruelle, and Haladeira. Two more family members of note were Maereles female cousins Jhassala and Nurimbrue.\nThe Oromanches made a fortune by importing a variety of goods from the cities of Baldurs Gate and Waterdeep. All of these goods were exotic and not readily available in Tethyr, allowing the Oromanche merchants to charge exuberant prices. Some of the more prominent goods made available by the Oromanches were liqueurs, wines, cheeses, perfumes, and aromatics.\nThe family rose to prominence in the 15 century DR, and by the , Oromanches had power, wealth, and status.

The weapon flew through a slot-like vent and stabbed the wizard in the process of ensorcelling the familys home in Mosstone with protective dweomers. Many similar murders were committed by the Sword of Spells until its reign of terror across the Realms ended in the spring of the  and suddenly as it started."
