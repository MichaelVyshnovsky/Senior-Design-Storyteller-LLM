        "mainbody": "El '''Sadimmin''' were the standard army of the country of [[Calimshan]].<ref name=EotSS-pp67-68>",
        "Etymology": "The term ''[[Alzhedo dictionary#S|sadimmin]]'' was plural, and meant \"powerful swords\".<ref name=EotSS-pp67-68/>",
        "Organization": "The Sadimmin forces of a given city were under the control of one of the sultans.<ref name=EotSS-pp67-68/> In [[1370 DR]], el Sadimmin had the following military ranks, from lowest to highest:<ref name=EotSS-p59>\n* [[Alzhedo dictionary#M|Musar]]\n* [[Alzhedo dictionary#C|Chawal]]\n* [[Alzhedo dictionary#Y|Yuzas]]\n* [[Alzhedo dictionary#S|Shyk]]\n* [[Alzhedo dictionary#B|Balak]]\n* [[Alzhedo dictionary#Q|Qayadin]]\n\nBy [[1374 DR]], Calimshan had reinstated the archaic ranks<ref name=EotSS-p59/> of [[Alzhedo dictionary#A|askar]], [[Alzhedo dictionary#D|djawal]], and [[Alzhedo dictionary#M|mumijin]] and created a new rank of [[Alzhedo dictionary#S|sahrmak]]. An askar was originally a term for a generic soldier.<ref name=EotSS-p59/> Originally, \"djawal\" was a term for a noble soldier, or knight,<ref name=EotSS-p59/> who were similar to officer cadets. Historically, a djawal outranked a musar, but this had changed by 1374. Between the ranks of shyk and balak, the mumijin was now inserted, and a sahrmak was a higher ranking general than even a qayadin.\n\nUpon reaching the rank of balak or qayadin, a soldier in el Sadimmin was granted a mansion or villa on the [[Ralan el Pesarkhal|syl-pasha's]] estate. This provided enhanced status for the officer but also meant that the syl-pasha could blackmail him more easily.<ref name=EotSS-pp67-68/>",
        "Garrisons": "The barracks for the soldiers of each [[sabban]] was known as a ''sadidah''. A ''sadidah'' often had a minaret attached to it and was four stories tall or taller.<ref name=Calimport-p8> They tended to be simple and practical structures, holding 40 to 60 troops. Each garrison was controlled by at least four officers and contained armories as well. A ''sadidah'' armory was stocked about twice as well as that of a typical [[amlakkhan]].<ref name=Calimport-p72>",
        "Decorations": "El Sadimmin awarded decorations to its troops who had demonstrated bravery or other favorable things, such as simply surviving a conflict. Known decorations in order of increasing prestige included:\n* Sword of the [[Syl-Pasha]] &mdash; an embroidered badge awarded for being wounded\n* Howl of the Black Horde &mdash; an embroidered badge awarded for skill during training\n* Chains of [[Harakhti]] &mdash; an embroidered badge awarded for service in a battle\n* Torch of the Seven Burnings &mdash; an embroidered badge awarded for service in a campaign\n* Axe of [[Shanatar]] &mdash; an embroidered badge\n* Eye of the [[Beholder]] &mdash; an embroidered badge\n* Quarrel of the Night &mdash; an embroidered badge\n* Fire of [[Memnon (efreeti)|Memnon]] &mdash; a reddish gold [[sash]]\n* Breath of [[Calim]] &mdash; a silvery-gold sash"
