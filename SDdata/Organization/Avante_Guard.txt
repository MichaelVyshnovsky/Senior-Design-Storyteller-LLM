The '''Avante Guard''' was an [[adventuring company]] based in the small city of [[Eylea]] somewhere in [[Faer√ªn]] in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite polyhedron/56/The Living City: Black Dugal's Music Shoppe|25}}<ref group="note">As noted on the Eylea page, it is unknown where in the Realms it actually is.

==History==
''Circa'' [[1338 DR]], the young [[wizard]] and would-be [[adventurer]] [[Dugal Buchannan|"Black" Dugal Buchannan]] went to Eylea to join the Avante Guard, but they declined him for his lack of experience.

After the Avante Guard destroyed a temple used by an obscure cult ''circa'' [[1340 DR]], the cultists sent their minions and hired mercenaries, including [[ogre]]s, [[troll]]s, [[drow]], and even [[demon]]s, against Eylea. The attack raged for two days before it was routed, leaving many dead.
