The '''Dungsweepers' Guild''' of [[Waterdeep]] was a group of street and stable cleaners who kept the city free from excess waste and refuse. While they were fairly poor, and seldom attracted new workers, they were a surprisingly influential organization.

It was rather noticeable when dung was not collected or piled in "inconvenient" locations, a fact that guildmasters occasionally used to remind the city of their importance.

==Uniform==
The guild's livery consisted of a hat with red and orange feathers.

==Activities==
The primary duty of guild members was to keep the streets, and for an extra fee the stables, of Waterdeep free from waste. When it was so required, they could also be tasked to work alongside members of the [[Cellarers' & Plumbers' Guild]] to assist with maintaining the city's vast [[Waterdeep/Sewers|sewer system]]. 

At the end of the day, members brought their sweepings to [[Fishgut Court]], where it was loaded onto wagons and carted away, under armed escort by the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]]. The refuse was taken south of the city walls to the refuse dump known as [[Rat Hills|"Rat Hills"]]. To prohibit smuggling, the wagon-loads were regularly inspected by guards and examined by low-skill [[mage]]s using spells like ''[[detect magic]]'' and ''[[detect invisibility]]''. [[Dung]] and urine were taken elsewhere in the city, being utilized in agriculture and industry respectively.

The Dungsweepers were allowed to comb through any items they turned up during their work and keep anything they could personally use. Valuables were turned into the guildmaster and sold, the profits of which were split between the individual and the guild itself.

==Membership==
Entrance into the guild cost 1 [[gp]], upon approval of the six Elder Dungsweepers. Annual dues were also the amount of 1 gp.

==Notable Members==
* Gillin, Gor and Tak, three [[halfling]]s who were part of the guild during the 15{{th}} century [[DR]].{{Cite adventurers league/Dock Ward Double Cross|19}}
