        "mainbody": "lan Karuck was a small group of ogrillons that resided in the Underdark beneath the Spine of the World.\nIn 1372 DR, Toogwik Tuk communicated with the clan leader, Grguch, and brought the tribe to the surface.\nDuring the campaign, they caused great damage to the Moonwood and also forced the elves themselves to retreat on a number of occasions. They used the elves own tactics against them, as the elves believed the orcs were mindless creatures. Although Clan Karuck had forced two retreats, these were not definitive victories, as two pegasus riders watching movements on the forest floor and Tosun Armgo aided their escape.\nThe clan, as with most orcs, used shamans, with Hakuun being the chief advisor to Grguch.\nThe clan were extremely resilient to assault and great tacticians, though whether this was thanks to Grguch or outside influences was unclear."
