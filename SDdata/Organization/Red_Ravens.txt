{{otheruses4|the mercenary company|the doomed adventurers|Company of the Red Raven}}
The '''Red Ravens''' were a [[Cormyr]]-based mercenary company formed by several people who fought together in the [[Horde War]]s. They headquartered in [[Arabel]], and led by [[Rayanna|Rayanna the Rose]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]]. The group's symbol was a red raven amulet. 

They were known to be trustworthy and honest as they did not want to lose their contracts with the Cormyrean government. 

==Forces==
The organization consisted of 110 members and they were able to triple their membership fairly easily when the need arose and equipped its members with [[studded leather armor]] and [[longsword]]s. It charged a weekly rate of 200 [[gold piece]]s for its services.

==History==
The Red Ravens were tasked by the crown with clearing the [[Stonelands]] to the north of Cormyr.
