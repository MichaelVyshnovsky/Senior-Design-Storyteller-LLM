The Red Ravens were a Cormyr-based mercenary company formed by several people who fought together in the Horde Wars. They headquartered in Arabel, and led by Rayanna the Rose in the late 14 century DR. The groups symbol was a red raven amulet. 
They were known to be trustworthy and honest as they did not want to lose their contracts with the Cormyrean government. 
The organization consisted of 110 members and they were able to triple their membership fairly easily when the need arose and equipped its members with studded leather armor and longswords. It charged a weekly rate of 200 gold pieces for its services.
The Red Ravens were tasked by the crown with clearing the Stonelands to the north of Cormyr.
