        "mainbody": "The Naug-orls (meaning \"devil worms\"), or simply the Worms, were Zhentil Keeps thieves guild around 1358 DR.\nThe Worms were led by someone called the \"Night Fingers\". Shounra Shalassalar was the Night Fingers of the Worms by around 1358 DR. All 600 members of the Worms reported to her through a secretive hierarchy.\nIn truth, however, the Night Fingers reported all the information collected to certain members of Zhentil Keeps Council of Lords. However, Shounras real master was Manshoon. However, the ties between criminal and official interests in Zhentil Keep were so strong that they usually acted more like a scouts company than thieves. \nFeared and shunned by the Zhents, the Worms secretly frequented all taverns and inns within the city, spying for their master. The Worms would kidnap, frame, arrest, or commit murder in service to their master.\nThe naug-orls operated out of the Thieves Guildhall within the Inner Quarter of Zhentil Keep.\nThe Naug-orls were seriously decimated in the 1368 DR invasion by Cyrics monstrous army and ceased to exist as organized force, although Shoundra tried to regroup her followers again."
