The wakadoshiyori were an office of the shogunate of Wa. They were the fourth most important office in the hierarchy of the shogunate.
The wakadoshiyori were considered subordinates of the Council of Elders, called the roju. Between two and four officials served in this role.
Like all other positions in the shogunate, to be a junior elder was a coveted role, and only the shogun could approve such an appointment.
These junior elders had similar duties to members of the roju but particularly oversaw the daimyos hatamono, or "bannermen". They also performed a miscellany of other activities, such as inspecting public buildings or supervising the appointment of staff and counselors to the daimyo.
