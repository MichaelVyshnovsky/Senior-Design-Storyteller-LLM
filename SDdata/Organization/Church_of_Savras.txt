The Church of Savras was a collection of clerics, monks, diviners and specialty priests called sibylites who were devoted to Savras, the All-Seeing One. 
The Church of Savras was relatively small as few in Faerûn knew of Savras or held him in poor regard. Savras clergy was collectively referred to as the divinators. The majority of his clergy was composed of sibylites. Novices were referred to as Truth Seekers. Other titles used in ascending order were Truth Speaker, Savant, Scholar, Sage, Clairvoyant, Soothsayer, Prophesier, Prophet, and Oracle. The highest ranking members of the clergy had unique titles. 
All divinators spent a great deal of time meditating in order to gain glimpses of the future.
The Vision was celebrated annually during the Feast of the Moon.
Savras largest house of worship was the House of the All-Seeing Orb located in Tashluta. He also maintained a hidden shrine, called the Hall of Pools and Mirrors, deep within Candlekeep.
The Sibylline Sisterhood was an organization of prophetic women who wandered west Faerûn providing prophesies for donations.
