The '''Company of Night''' were a group of [[Sembia|Sembite]] [[adventurer]]s who operated ''circa'' [[1369 DR]]. They had a strong rivalry with the [[Stag Runners]], another Sembite company.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1369}}, the Company of Night attended a party hosted by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] at [[Thistleflame Manor]] in [[Suzail]]. The occasion was King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]]'s birthday, and Lord Thistle hoped to improve the standing of adventuring companies in Cormyr by having them present themselves as a gesture of fealty to the King.

==Known members of the Company of Night==
* [[Iona Waukeenservant]]
* [[Idalia Golddust]]
