The '''Seven Satraps''' were the men who led the rebels of the [[Schamedar Plains]] to the depose [[Shond Tharovin]] and the [[Cult of the Living Gem]] from [[Schamedar]] during the [[Living Gem War|''Living Gem'' War]].

==History==
The group was formed in the month of [[Eleasias]] in the {{YearlinkName|1367}} from among the towns and villages primarily along the [[River of Ice]] in eastern [[Calimshan]]. They publicly promised to be ready to sacrifice their lives if necessary to defeat Shond Tharovin, who had taken control of the city of Schamedar the month prior.

Seemingly in response, strange dark creatures appeared from the skies over the next few months and began to murder and pillage.

By the month of [[Uktar]], the Seven Satraps had managed to raise an armed force, and they laid siege to the city. The ''[[Living Gem]]'' hovered above the walls and sent down fire and lightning on the attackers, but the Satraps army maintained the siege for nearly a year, until at last the Cult of Gem went into hiding, taking the ''Living Gem'' with them.

Afterward, the [[syl-pasha]] of [[Calimport]] declared that the Seven Satraps would be the new rulers of Schamedar.

There rule began in {{Yearlink|1368}},{{Schamedar council}}

==Members==
As the name implies, there were seven men who called themselves the Seven Satraps. Three of them were [[Batras el Beza]], [[Daud el Akiil]], and [[Saibh el Moadyph]]. After the defeat of the Cult of the Living Gem, these three controlled most of the leaders of Schamedar, and guided them to do the will of [[El Kahmir]] crime family. The other four Satraps were never able to unify against the three in any meaningful way.
