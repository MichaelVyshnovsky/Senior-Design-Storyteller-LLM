'''House Dracohorn''' was a small noble house of [[Cormyr]]. The family had a bad reputation among the other noble houses of Cormyr. The family wanted to shift power from the king to the nobles.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail}}

==History==
The house was founded by [[Keolan Dracohorn]] when he found a dead young [[blue dragon]] on the site that would become [[Soldier's Green]], near [[Suzail]], and claimed that he had killed it.

During the [[Abraxus affair]] in [[1369 DR]], the Dracohorns publicly urged for the transfer of power from the crown to the nobility and barely escaped exile.
