House Dracohorn was a small noble house of Cormyr. The family had a bad reputation among the other noble houses of Cormyr. The family wanted to shift power from the king to the nobles.
The house was founded by Keolan Dracohorn when he found a dead young blue dragon on the site that would become Soldiers Green, near Suzail, and claimed that he had killed it.
During the Abraxus affair in 1369 DR, the Dracohorns publicly urged for the transfer of power from the crown to the nobility and barely escaped exile.
