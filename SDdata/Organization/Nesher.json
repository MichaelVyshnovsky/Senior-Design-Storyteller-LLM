Just across Mendever Street and down a couple doors was the [[Gundwynd]] family villa.  Directly across the alley on the south side of the compound was the towering five-story domicile of [[Hlethvagi Anteos]].\n\nLord [[Khallos Nesher]], brother of Lord Laskar,The source says that Khallos was the brother of Stelar, but this is not possible since Stelar's maiden name was Thorp.

Kastonoph witnessed a [[doppleganger]] attack, foiled an assassination attempt, and learned that his own father was attempting to blackmail the bride-to-be.\n\nA month after the abduction, the majority of Waterdeep's inhabitants thought Piergeiron the Paladinson dead as his spirit was trapped inside a ''[[soul gem]]''. In the weeks that led to the Open Lord's funeral, Laskar Nesher was among ambitious nobles fighting for Piergeiron's position. Neshers stirred public opinion, gave numerous speeches, and even provided bleached [[oak]] panels, rails, and bosses for the [[Palace of Waterdeep]], \"out of love for the great Piergeiron.\" In the month Waterdeep was without an Open Lord, Laskar won support of ten respected merchants and three guilds, as well as made an agreement with [[Boareskyr]] brothers, the [[Boareskyr Bridge]] in exchange for [[High Forest]] lumber, claiming the trade route with [[Kara-Tur]]. Laskar and his consort Stelar were both present during the funeral ceremony. However, Laskar's grab for power was for naught with Piergeiron's recovery soon after.",
