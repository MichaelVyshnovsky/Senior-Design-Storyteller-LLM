The '''Iridescent Peacock Society''' was a secret society in [[Kozakura]].

==Description==
The Iridescent Peacock Society was the only society composed by normally solitary evil [[wu jen]]. The Society had regular magical practices among its members, and offered training, protection, and aid to members in need of such assistance. The society did anything to keep its existence secret: secret recognition signs, dangerous tests for prospective joiners, and an organization of cells of limited membership.

The Society's headquarters was located in the imperial capital, [[Dojyu]].

==History==
The Iridescent Peacock Society, knowing that evil wu jen prospered in time of warfare, supported the return of [[Hojo Todahiro]]. Meanwhile, the wu jen associates worked independently to do anything to start war in Kozakura.
