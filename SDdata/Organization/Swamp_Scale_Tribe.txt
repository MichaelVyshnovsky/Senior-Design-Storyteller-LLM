The '''Swamp Scale Tribe''' was a [[lizardfolk]] tribe located in [[Surmarsh]] in [[Thay]]. In the 1330s DR, it had allegiance to the [[black dragon]] [[Insithryllax]].

==History==
In [[1335 DR]], the young [[Red Wizard]] [[Marek Rymüt]] came to the Surmarsh with a company of Thayan mages and warriors under the orders of the [[Tharchion]] of [[Eltabbar]] to collect 1000 [[gold piece]]s in taxes that were owed by the Swamp Scale Tribe. The tribe inhabited Thayan territory but it had chosen to serve the black dragon Insithryllax, which Marek learned in the course of his mission in the swamp.

The lizardfolk went to battle with Marek's force, but the Thayan soldiers were victorious. Insithryllax then revealed himself and killed all of the Thayans except for Marek, who succeeded in using a ''[[charm monster]]'' spell to enthrall the black dragon.
