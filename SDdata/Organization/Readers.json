The simple act of reading granted them their clerical powers retention and comprehension of the subject matter was not required to gain access to their powers.\nThe Readers started several holy crusades over their 400-year existence.\nThe Readers were based in Huzuz, because the City of Delights had the best centers of learning in all of Zakhara. However, they could be found in any city that had a university or other renowned place of learning."
