        "mainbody": "Clan Boldenbar was one of the two shield dwarf clans in the Vast chiefly responsible for the construction of the city of Sarbreen, part of the larger kingdom of Roldilar, and the rulers of it in all but name.\nAn heirloom of this clan that was passed down through the generations, a Hammer of Thunderbolts, was the source of Sarbreens alias, \"City of the Hammer\". When the kingdom of Roldilar fell, Unteius led the citys refugees to safety. While traveling through the Underdark, his Hammer of thunderbolts was lost somewhere during an ambush, though the events of that day went unrecorded.\nBy the late 14 century DR, Clan Boldenbar was making efforts to reestablish its presence and authority within the Vast, reopening many of its old clan halls.\n* Adlon\n* Cernd Turbaern, nephew of Verm Turbaern.\n* Embersar Glarm\n* Erden\n* Tuir\n* Untieus Boldenbar, one of the eight Master Masons that ruled the city of Sarbreen.\n* Verm Turbaern, the Clan Elder of Boldenbar in the late 14 century DR."
