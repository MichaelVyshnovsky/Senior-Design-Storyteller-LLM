The Church of Tempus was the collective group of individuals that called upon Tempus the god of war as their patron deity. It was one of the most prolific religions in the Realms, and one that attracted people from all walks of life Its members engaged many wars without specific affiliation to one government or another.
While there was no chief authority within Tempus church, it maintained a disciplined and militaristic hierarchy.
Befitting an organization that extolled the virtues of warfare, the church bestowed upon its members military-style ranks and titles. Clergy members often referred to one another as Hammers, a name derived from the saying "the small, hammering hands of the Foehammer".
As of the mid–14 century DR, these included, in descending order Lord/Lady of the Field, Swordmaster/mistress, Battlelord/lady, Shield of the God, Lance of the Lord, Terrible Sword, Swung Sword, and Warpriest. Higher rank could be achieved by distinct service to the church, when necessary in times of need, or temporarily when it was deemed necessary.
Additional titles associated with a specific role in the church were put in these ranks when appropriate. The title of Warlyon, or Trusted Sword, was bestowed upon the heads of Tempus temples and Arahar, or Battle Chaplain, was give to clergy members that oversaw his shrines. 
Circa the late 15 century, the title of Direhar was used for guardian-priests, Rauthar for swordmasters, Hardhar for warrior-priests, and Stalwart for other priests.
The faithful of Tempus aided anyone or group that had genuine need to engage in battle, regardless of affiliation. but would not act as commanders or generals-for-hire. Rather they strived to maintain honor, respect, and professionalism among the combatants of battles, including those in which they participated. 
Tempus clergy made great efforts to help predominantly human societies prepare for war, with a focus on mustering defenses against terrifying creatures or monstrous humanoids.
On occasion, the church led crusades against other groups or entities whose actions threatened their institution. These great and terrible campaigns were described by some as "a civilized mans barbarian horde".
When not instructing or supporting others in the arts of war, offering prayers to Tempus or otherwise engaging in warfare themselves, Tempuran clergy spent much of their time in training in preparation for their next battle.
The most mighty of Tempus priests could magically imbue weaponry and armor with the consciousness of retired and elderly once-great warriors. This could be witnessed in the construction of some helmed horrors found across Faerûn.
One of the most common Tempuran rituals was the prayer calling for bravery and self-preservation invoked before battle, or the night before battle. Clerics specifically prayed for their divine spells before Highsun every day.
Additionally, clergy members held the Feast of Heroes at Highsun each day,  and performed the Song for the Fallen as the sun began to set. At some temples, high priests would perform a ceremony entitled the Song of the Sword for Tempus faithful worshipers.
All followers to Tempus were expected to spill blood—either their own or that of an enemy combatant—at least once per tenday.
Once each year, during the Feast of the Moon following Uktar, priests of Tempus from across the Realms began the March of the Dead in their nearby settlements. During this ceremony, priests would list the names of the fallen dead in a chant as they walked through town or throughout the city streets.
Two famous battles were celebrated locally among Tempus faithful in the Dalelands, the Battle of Ambroses Fall on Uktar 7, and the Battle of Swords Creek on Flamerule 17.
On occasion, some of the larger temples would host grand athletic competitions known as "champion frays".
Worship of Tempus was prominent among the peoples of Amn, Chessenta, Cormyr, Dambrath, the Dragon Coast, Icewind Dale, the Moonshae Isles Narfell the Nelanther Isles, the Shaar, the Sword Coast, Threskel, Unther, the Vast, the Vilhon Reach, Waterdeep, and the Western Heartlands.
Temples dedicated to the Lord of Battle tended to resemble military fortresses rather than actual places of worship. Shrines were often adorned with shattered weapons, damaged armor, or even the heads of recently-slain monsters.
An altar to Tempus was also set up within each temple of the Red Knight.

Tempus clergy typically wore the same armor they would don on the battlefield— The quality of their armor depended on their rank. High-ranking Warlyon priests wore enchanted plate mail decorated with filigree, while battle-chaplain Arahars wore splint mail, and lesser priests wore simple chainmail. They always took care to never wear helms or headgear that covered their face however, that was considered profane emulation of Tempus likeness. 
Some of the more zealous orders of the church always kept at least one piece of armor on their bodies at all times. This practice was less common among Tempuran clergy found in larger cities.

Followers of Tempus believed their god did not achieve victory in war, rather provided aid for those that were deserving of it. Warfare was a natural force of the world, the great equalizer of the mortals of the Realms. For during battle, any mortal could be just as easily slain as they could achieve greatness and glory.
They believed Tempus honored those that engaged in honorable warfare and did not succumb to cowardly or shameful tactics such as terrorizing innocents, performing torture, utilizing poisons, or committing outright slaughter.
While in battle, Tempuran faithful often called out the names of their fellow clergymen that had previously been slain, or otherwise were forced to retire from a life of active combat.
While they were stalwart in their beliefs, and would readily defend their faith in battle, Tempus clergy did not engage in war without reason, or when they felt there was no chance of victory. A swift, decisive battle was much more preferable over a long, drawn-out engagement. They felt the consequences of engaging in war should be carefully considered before initiating the first battle. At the same time, those that attempted to avoid conflict, either by fleeing or attempts at parlay, were cowards among the most harmful to all of civilization.
Worshipers of Tempus always honored the dead that fell in battles past. Their names were to be recorded after every battle, for future inclusion in the March of the Dead. Gratuitous destruction was never acceptable under any circumstances.
* Order of the Broken Blade, a order composed of former Tempuran warriors and other clergy that were unable to effectively fight in battle.
* Order of the Steel Fang, an elite fighting group often dispatched by the church to the deadliest assignments across the Realms.

Distinct conflict arose between Tempus Waterdhavian clergy and the citys worshipers of Shar.
Following the decline of the Untheric pantheon, the Tempuran church maintained a rivalrous relationship with the church of Anhur. Each organization competed with one another for faithful that sought to venerate a patron of martial combat.
The churchs dogma was diametrically opposed to that of the Eldaths faithful.
