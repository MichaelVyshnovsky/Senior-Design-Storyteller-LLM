The Thuunlakalaga was a clan of goliaths that dwelled within the Spine of the World mountains as of the late 15 century DR.
Clan younglings underwent a coming-of-age ceremony that involved offering up a symbol of their childhood and venturing through a rune-covered tunnel that induced extrasensory visions.
Like other nearby clans, the Thuunlakalaga goliaths were fond of the game goat-ball.
The Thuunlakalaga clan made their home within Wyrmdoom Crag in the Spine of the World mountains.
The clan had a long and ongoing feud with the Akannathi goliaths of Skytower Shelter, that originated from a catastrophic game of goat-ball that led to a wounded Thuunlakalaga child and a slain Akannathi griffon.
A short time after settling within their mountainside home, the Thuunlakalaga goliaths were attacked by a full-grown white dragon. The clanmates fought alongside one another to slay the monstrous dragon, and decorated the entrance to their home with its remains.
