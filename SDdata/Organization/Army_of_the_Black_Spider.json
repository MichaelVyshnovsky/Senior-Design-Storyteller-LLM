        "mainbody": "The '''Army of the Black Spider''' was an army put together by the noble houses of [[Menzoberranzan]] to defeat the approaching armies of [[Gracklstugh]] (joined by [[Kaanyr Vhok]]'s [[Scourged Legion]]) in [[1372 DR]] during the [[Silence of Lolth]].",
        "Description": "The Army of the Black Spider was composed of soldiers from all great houses, as well as sixteen minor ones. There were 30 commanding [[priestess|high priestesses]], 4,000 [[drow]] soldiers, and 2,500 slaves.\n\nAfter the first battle, a fourth to a third of the army had been lost. House Baenre had 90 dead and 44 woundedâ€”more than a quarter of their strength. [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]] lost a quarter of their forces and all of their wagon trains.",
        "Base": "The army mustered in a plaza near the border of the [[West Wall]] and [[Narbondellyn]] districts in Menzoberranzan.",
        "History": "At the end of [[1372 DR]], during the [[Silence of Lolth]] when the city's priestesses were greatly weakened, the forces of [[Gracklstugh]], driven by [[Nimor Imphraezl]] of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]], moved to attack Menzoberranzan. Allied with [[House Agrach Dyrr]] within the city and wanting to draw the city's forces out, Nimor disguised himself as Captain [[Zhayemd]] of House Agrach Dyrr and reported that [[Rhazzt's Dilemma]], a drow outpost in the [[Underdark]], had been attacked. That report spurred the mustering of the Army of the Black Spider.\n\nThe army moved to engage the attacking [[duergar]] at the [[Pillars of Woe]]. However, that was in fact a trap manufactured by Nimor. Once at the Pillars of Woe, the soldiers of Agrach Dyrr turned on their fellows and the [[tanarukk]]s of the [[Scoured Legion]] led by [[Kaanyr Vhok]] joined in the fray. The drow army was not very unified, particularly after the loss of Agrach Dyrr. Reinforcements from [[House Baenre]] arrived after [[Nauzhror Baenre]] scried the battle and saw their predicament. The Baenre contingent allowed the army to retreat, but not without heavy losses. The companies of Houses [[House Fey-Branche|Fey-Branche]], [[House Duskryn|Duskryn]], and [[House Kenafin|Kenafin]] had been wiped out, but many soldiers of Houses Baenre, [[House Xorlarrin|Xorlarrin]], and [[House Tuin'Tarl|Tuin'Tarl]], among others, were able to retreat back to the city. Nimor was briefly captured by [[Andzrel Baenre]], but he was able to escape using his ''[[ring of shadow]]''.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Army of the Black Spider, the duergar and tanarukk armies subsequently marched forth and began the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]].",
        "Members of the Army of the Black Spider": "* [[Mez'Barris Armgo]]: The nominal commander of the army, though the male commanders truly ran the show.\n* [[Andzrel Baenre]]: As weapons master of House Baenre, he was the male commander of the army.\n* [[Nimor Imphraezl]]: Under the alias Captain Zhayemd of House Agrach Dyrr, this prince of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] was able to infiltrate the army to weaken it and foster its betrayal by the forces of House Agrach Dyrr."
