Thornhold, a fortress located off the southern edge of the Mere of Dead Men, was owned by the warlord Brunyundar Margaster until it was captured and claimed by a paladin as part of the Second Troll War. House Margaster continued to claim a right to Thornhold into the late 15 century DR.\nBy the time of the War of the Silver Marches, the Margasters owned property in Silverymoon, including a three-story tower and a detached carriage house. Two cambions guarded a stash of magical items in the carriage house, while Xamlyn Margaster resided in the tower.\nBy the time of the War of the Silver Marches of 1485 DR, several members of the Margaster family were secret worshipers of Asmodeus.\nIn 1488 DR, the Margaster family had allied with the drow of House Hunzrin and together managed a business of demonic phylacteries.\n* Brunyundar Margaster\n* Alaeros Margaster\n* Xamlyn Margaster\n* Orn Margaster\n* Inkeri Margaster\n* Alvilda Margaster\n* Brevindon Margaster\n* Othovir"
