}}The '''Phangarl''' family was wealthy and influential in [[Khôltar]], [[south Faerûn]], ''circa'' the [[1372 DR|Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR]]. They were one of twenty Houses that had a seat on the [[Onsruur]]&mdash;the council of lords that governed the Iron City.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|88}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 66: Khôltar, Part 17, More on the Onsruur}}

==Organization==
This bloodline had no obvious distinguishing features. As a clan, they enjoyed acting, especially comedy, and enthusiastically supported playwrights and troupes that wrote and performed humorous works.

==Activities==
In Khôltar, the Phangarls owned a hinge-making company, several coach manufacturers, and some businesses that specialized in decoration. Foreign investments included various trading companies in [[Var the Golden]]. They also bred [[horse]]s for sale, but were not equestrians by any means.

==Tactics==
There was nothing funny about their trading tactics. The Phangarl clan secretly dealt with [[Shaaryan]] raiders, paying them to attack caravans belonging to or being used by their rivals, while leaving costers in which they had an interest alone.
