The '''Wandering Legion''' was a military organization in [[Zakhara]], the Land of Fate. 

==History==
During the reign of the [[First Caliph]], the Wandering Legion rose to oppose the [[Exalted One]] and his spreading of the Word of the [[Loregiver]]. They were eventually defeated but were shown mercy and had their lives spared. The vanquished legion declared: "Blessed be the Word and the Law for truly it is greater than we. None shall we follow who does not cleave to the Law." This oath was sworn upon a [[spear]] of [[silver]] that was later called the [[Spear of the Wandering Legion]].
