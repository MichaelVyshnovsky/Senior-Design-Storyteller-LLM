The Wandering Legion was a military organization in Zakhara, the Land of Fate. 
During the reign of the First Caliph, the Wandering Legion rose to oppose the Exalted One and his spreading of the Word of the Loregiver. They were eventually defeated but were shown mercy and had their lives spared. The vanquished legion declared "Blessed be the Word and the Law for truly it is greater than we. None shall we follow who does not cleave to the Law." This oath was sworn upon a spear of silver that was later called the Spear of the Wandering Legion.
