[[Cedric deLancie|Torsin Cedric deLancie]] commanded the [[Waterdhavian]] [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|guardsmen]], [[Kyrill Nederlok|Marshal Kyrill Nederlok]] led the mercenaries of the [[Flaming Fist]], and [[Haither Stonehand|General Haither Stonehand]] directed the militiamen of Daggerford.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Coalition formed their war camp at a location near [[Dead Man's Pass]], some ways north of the [[Winding Water]].",
        "History": "{{See also|War of the Shining Crusade}}\nWhile the three powers of the Coalition agreed to form an alliance together, their forces were not able to rally together for some time. It was not until the siege of [[Bridgefort]] was broken, that the Flaming Fist army coming from Baldur's Gate could march north beyond the Winding Water. Even then, it was a matter of weeks before they rendezvoused with the armies of Daggerford and Waterdeep.\n\nThe Coalition won two decisive battles against the Shining Crusade. The first was a defense of their own war camp, when it was assaulted by various units of the Shining Legion. The second was a counterattack, when the Coalition army besieged the ruins of Dragonspear Castle, routed the crusaders, and stopped the Shining Lady from inflicting further destruction upon the [[Sword Coast]]",
