        "mainbody": "The College of New Olamn, simply known as New Olamn, was a traditional bardic college in Waterdeep. It was formed as a successor to the old College of Ollamh (), also known as just Olamn.\nBards traveled from around Faerûn to study there.\nStudents of New Olamn were trained in their chosen instruments and underwent a rigorous study of ancient history and memorization of ancient songs and sagas. Most bards of New Olamn studied the College of Lore and practiced its methods.\nMaster bards (those generally acknowledged to have finished their studies elsewhere) who studied at New Olamn and completed their studies there were conferred the degree of Magnus Alumna.\nThe old Olamn college stood on the site later occupied by the House of Song in the Trades Ward. (A popular local story held that Olamn had stood on the site of Halambar Lutes & Harps, but this was false.)\nThe New Olamn college was located in two villas, Heroes Rest and Stormwatch, in the Castle Ward. They stood on the Cliffride, a gravel path that ran up the northern side of Mount Waterdeep, overlooking the sea near Waterdeep.\nThe Cliffride was used to bring supplies to the college, but most visitors and students\nNew Olamn held a moderately sized amphitheater, where many musicians (particularly members of the Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers) performed their own works. It also featured operas, which were attended by wealthy citizen.\nthumb|right|250px|The Ollamh harp, named after the original college.\nThe original College of Ollamh was one of the seven elder bardic colleges, dating back to the legendary bard Falataer who established it as the final level of his bardic college. The Ollamh harp, one of the Instruments of the Bards, was named after this college. It had been created by Falataer to test and reward his students who achieved mastery of the Ollamh level of skill. Following this tradition, bards studying to obtain the rank of Magna Alumnae attended all seven colleges, and Ollamh was traditionally the last. However, this practice was abandoned once the original colleges declined,\nFollowing the disgruntled bard Iriador \"Garnet\" Wintermists attacks in the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR, Danilo Thann saw a need to re-establish a bardic college in Waterdeep. Working with Kriios Halambar, master of the musicians guild, he developed a plan to re-found such institutions, beginning with one in Waterdeep. Led by Halambar, the Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, & Choristers threw their weight behind the proposal, and it was backed by wealthy patrons of the Crommor, Estelmer, Majarra, Melshimber, and Thann noble families. Lord Kelthul Majarra and Lady Hlanta Melshimber even donated the Stormwatch and Heroes Rest villas to serve as the colleges new home. In the Year of the Staff, 1366 DR, the college was reopened with the name of New Olamn.\nWithin a few years, New Olamn made a name for itself as a quality source of education and a premier storehouse of lore. Bards traveled from around Faerûn to study there.\nWhen Kriios Halambar died in the early 1370s DR, with an election for his replacement as guildmaster not scheduled until the Year of the Haunting, 1377 DR, leading guild musicians began to jostle for influence and position. This provoked thinly veiled tensions between leading Waterdhavian musicians, both in the Council and in New Olamns leadership."
