The Hunt was an adventuring company based in Selgaunt.
The Hunt was active in the Cormyr, Sembia, Dalelands, and Moonsea areas.
Before 1357 DR, the Hunt suffered losses in Archendale while fighting local troops. Around 1357 DR, they were active in the Myth Drannor area.
While adventuring in Myth Drannor, Shasslan Timtrane, Crommlar Muirel, and Tanagost Arletoll were separated from the others and were teleported deep within Undermountain. Wounded, they eventually made their way to the Promenade of the Dark Maiden where they received shelter and healing. In 1370 DR, the three returned to the surface after exploring the palace of the dead necromancer Shradin Mulophor beneath Skullport, during which they unwittingly brought his clone out of stasis.
The group consisted entirely of humans and was led by Shasslan Timtrane, a female fighter.
