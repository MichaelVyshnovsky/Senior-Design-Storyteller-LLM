The Kneebreakers were a vigilante organization in Damara in 1359 DR. 
The Kneebreakers were a group of young halflings riding war-pigs in search of a thrill in their peaceful existence. They were a group of able warriors who had no problem with retreating if the situation went wrong.
Their charter was revoked in dramatic fashion in the late 15 century DR by King Yarin Frostmantle.
