The Hazimtar were a clan of yuan-ti who were a part of the greater Eselemas tribe in the 14 century DR. They dominated the city of Lushpool in Lapaliiya.
By 1373 DR, nine of the sixteen satraps who governed Lushpool were secretly Hazimtar purebloods. The city had thus been effectively under yuan-ti control for over two centuries. In theory, the Overking of Lapaliiya ruled over Lushpool via their heir, the Prince Royal and nominal ruler of the city. However, in practice, to enact a new policy, an Overking typically had to negotiate with the Lushpan council of satraps. Lushpool was the third most politically powerful city in Lapaliiya, giving the Hazimtar great influence in the realm.
Throughout their history, the Lushpan satraps were perforce reclusive, remaining cloistered within their luxurious, fortified compounds, issuing decrees in writing via servants (human but often tainted ones). They were only seen masked, and when they wished to address the citizens or give an audience, they used magic to speak through the mouths of chained female slaves.
The Hazimtar introduced initial breeding stocks of several rare species of freshwater fish from Lake Lemas beside the Black Jungles to the pools of Lushpool. Their roe were delicacies all around Faer√ªn and the citys primary export, bringing Lushpool most of its riches.
