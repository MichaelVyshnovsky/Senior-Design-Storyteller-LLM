The '''Fellowship of the Purple Staff''' was a group of like-minded [[priest]]s and other faithful who united in the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, to settle the area of the [[Gulthmere Forest]] and other lands north of [[Turmish]] and turn it into a civilized theocracy they called the "[[Holy Realm]]".{{Cite polyhedron/98/Elminster's Everwinking Eye: More Hidden Powers of Turmish|25}}

==Organization==
By the mid-1370s [[DR]], the Fellowship of the Purple Staff was made up of followers of [[Chauntea]], [[Helm]], [[Selûne]], [[Lathander]], [[Sune]], and [[Nobanion]]—primarily [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s. There were also a few [[wizard]]s that supported the group. The Fellowship believed that establishment of the Holy Realm was ordained by their [[deities]] and that they were carrying out divine will. The vast majority of the members were [[human]], but [[elves]], [[half-elves]], and [[dwarves]] were also represented. Almost all non-[[evil]] inhabitants of the region were welcome to the Fellowship, as long as they were willing to work hard and had something to contribute.

==Activities==
The Holy Realm was envisioned to be a scattering of temple-farms isolated by the old-growth trees of Gulthmere, connected by roads built by their wizard allies. They planned on sustainable areas for harvesting timber and expected to eventually export lumber, animal pelts, ore from the nearby [[Orsraun Mountains]], wooden items, armor, tools, and clothing, becoming a significant trading entity with its neighbors around the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]].

==Tactics==
The Fellowship regularly sent scouting parties into the forest, looking for suitable settlement sites and noting any problem areas. They often hired bands of [[adventurer]]s to banish [[pirate]] camps and to hunt down evil or dangerous monsters. Membership dues also paid for assisting crafters to set up a shop in the Holy Realm on the condition that they stay for a minimum of two years.

==Base of Operations==
By the end of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Fellowship had founded three hamlets with a total population of 900 souls

==Relationships==
Most of the members of the Fellowship were worshipers of Chauntea, Helm, Lathander, Nobanioin, Selûne, or Sune, and therefore the group had cordial relations with the churches of those deities. Some members were also members of various orders within these churches, such as the [[Field Guardians]] of Chauntea and the [[Vigilant Eyes of the God]] of Helm, and could request aid from them when necessary. In the 1370s, the organization reached out to the [[Harpers]] as a like-minded group that understood the balance between nature and civilization, and had an active diplomatic presence in Turmish, [[Cormyr]], [[Sembia]], and some of the city-states along the Dragon Coast. The [[Church of Silvanus]] withheld judgment and watched carefully to see where the Fellowship drew the line between nature and civilization.

Enemies of the Fellowship included the anti-civilization [[People of the Black Blood]], who wanted to turn the settlers into [[lycanthrope]]s and live a tribal life of subsistence, and any pirates inconvenienced by interference from groups hired by the Fellowship. The followers of antagonistic deities such as [[Bane]], [[Malar]], [[Shar]], and [[Talos]] also did not want to see the Holy Realm established, but, as of the early 1370s, none of these groups had formed any significant organized opposition.

==Membership==
Members of the organization were called "Fellows" regardless of gender. New members were called "Newfellows" during a one-year probationary period and could be removed from the ranks by a majority vote of Fellows. Each Fellow had one vote and all issues put up for a vote were announced at least three [[tenday]]s beforehand. All members were expected to pay dues, although, in the early years, much of the funding for Fellowship business came from the wealthier senior members.

Each member was expected to volunteer at least one contiguous tenday per year to applying their skills to the betterment of the community, and could be called upon at other times if the need was great. Newfellows usually began their probationary period with their tenday of service and were often asked for a second tenday in the latter half of their first year. Members did not get any compensation for this service beyond room and board, if needed, although, rare or expensive [[material component]]s for spellcasting were provided and the cost of item creation covered, so as not to unduly burden the caster. Typical service tasks included:
* Clerics: [[:Category:Healing spells|Healing]]; cast ''[[zone of truth]]'' and ''[[lesser geas]]'' for judicial trials; lead worship services.
* Druids: Heal animals; enrich crops with ''[[plant growth]]''; prune vegetation with ''[[diminish plants]]'' as needed for roads, ''etc.'';  educate the populace about living in harmony with nature; lead worship services.
* Paladins: Military leadership; guard a village; provide security for important people, places, or things.
* Rangers: Patrol the outer reaches of the Holy Realm; scout in advance of expansion; guard the community as a whole; promote respect for nature and its creatures.
* Wizards: Assist with roads and other public works projects using ''[[levitate]]'', ''[[fabricate]]'', ''[[wall of stone]]'', and ''[[mending]]''; cast ''[[continual flame]]'' for street lighting; improve the appearance of defenses with ''[[illusory wall]]''.

==History==
The Fellowship of the Purple Staff was founded in 1368 DR by priests of Chauntea, Helm, and Selûne from Turmish, wooded enclaves near [[Starmantle]], and various other places around the [[Vilhon Reach]]. with a total population of around 900 settlers, and had established trade connections to Telpir and Amry.
