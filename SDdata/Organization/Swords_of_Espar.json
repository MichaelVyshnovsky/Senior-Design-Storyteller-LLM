        "mainbody": "The '''Swords of Espar''' was an adventuring company from the city of [[Espar]] in the nation of [[Cormyr]], active in the early-to-mid 14{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "The Swords of Espar were founded decades before the {{YearlinkName|1348}}. Over the adventuring group's carer, the Swords of Espar gained fame and status. The ballad retelling the Swords' fierce battle with the [[dragon]] [[Azazarrundoth]], known as the ''[[Dragondown Slaying]]'', was performed monthly by Cormyrean [[minstrel]]s. In 1348 DR, a band of young heroes from Espar, sponsored by King [[Azoun Obarskyr IV]], attempted to register their adventuring charter under the name of the Swords of Espar. However, the Charter Law in Cormyr forbade the registration of a new charter license using existing adventuring companies' names. At the time, some of the members of the Swords were still alive, including [[Mlaareth]], who resided in [[Suzail]] and enjoyed wealth and attention. Undermaster of the Rolls and Scribe Royal [[Blaunel]] was greatly amused at the fact that youth from Espar was not aware of the famed adventuring band. The youths eventually settled on the name of the [[Knights of Myth Drannor|Swords of Eveningstar]]."
