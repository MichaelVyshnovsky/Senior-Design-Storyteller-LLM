        "mainbody": "The Church of Helm was the organized collective of clerics, paladins, fighters, guards and other martial protectors, who dedicated their service to the god of vigilance, Helm. They dedicated themselves to the protection of those who could not protect themselves and shared their skills and tenets with the guardians and defenders of Faerûn, and beyond.\nthumb|An armored priest of Helm.|521x521px\nThe church of Helm was organized into a strict military hierarchy. The Supreme Watcher was the single highest source of authority within the church, though it remained vacant since the 10 century DR. \nThe Council of Helm, composed of four Archancels, oversaw Helmite activities up until the late 15 century. Each Archancel took charge over the clergy in one of four broad territories of Faerûn, including  \n*The Sword Coast north of the Lands of Intrigue, and all the lands west across the Trackless Sea.\n*The northern realms, from Savage North in the west, along the northern shore of the Sea of Fallen Stars all the way to Rashemen in the east.\n*The southwestern realms, including the Lands of Intrigue, the Chultan Peninsula, Turmish, Chondath, all the way to the Great Rift.\n*All the lands to the east, including the Old Empires and much of the Unapproachable East.\nWhile not an official arm of Helms church per se, there was a group known as the Eye of Justice that worshiped Helm alongside the deities Tyr and Torm. This belief was known as the Heresy of the Threefold God.\nCirca the late 14 century DR, titles within the church included (in descending order) \nBishous, Senior Steeleye, High Watcher, Overblade, Guardian, Watcher, Watchknight, Alert, Trusty, Adept, and Novice.\nBy the late 15 century, the churchs titles had changed to\nChancels, each of whom directly served the Archancels Bishous, each of whom presided over a single realm Lectors, local commanders and investigators Ardeacons Prelates Vicarphs Pyrats, or priests Novices and Honored Laity, officers within the church that were not members of Helms clergy. \nClergy of the church were formally referred to as Vigilators or Hands of the Vigilant One.\nFollowing the Time of Troubles they set out to win back favor among the people of Faerûn with renewed demonstrations of excellent and loyal service as protectors. The church sponsored the training of guards and armed escorts in various cities throughout the realms, extolling their virtues and worthiness as the only guardians that were worthy for hire. Anyone found violating Helmite protectorship by slaying one of his faithful were often blacklisted from enlisting the churchs services.\nThe clergy of Helm would take in anyone who sought sanctuary within the walls of their fortified churches, persecuted and criminally accused alike. Those running from the authorities would be turned over to local law enforcement, though the presiding Helmite priest would ensure a fair and just trial.\nOne of the holiest of the Helmite rituals was the consecration of a Postulant, performed upon the confirmation of a persons dedication as they entered into the ranks of the Helmite clergy. Others included the consecration of a Glymtul, was used to dedicate items into service unto Helm the purification, a ritual of atonement when clergy  returned to the faith after leaving its service, or otherwise failed in their duties and the Holy Vigil, a night-long ceremony was performed by a priest of Helm when they ascended in rank within the church.\nHelmite priests prayed for their spells either in the morning or at night, soon after waking or shortly before bed.\nThe faithful of Helm celebrated their devotion with the Ceremony to Honor Helm on Shieldmeet. They held no other annual observances or holidays.\nThe church of Helm was a strong, protective presence throughout the North. They were oft regarded as the regions first defenders against attacks from monstrous beasts and malevolent humanoids.\nVeneration of Helm was prevalent across Faerûn, including the realms of Chessenta, Cormyr, the Dragon Coast, the Silver Marches, Tethyr, Thay, the Vilhon Reach,\nThe Helmlands of Cormyr were named after the god Helm. It was a troubled and tarnished landscape, permeated with wild magic, and dead-magic zones, having been the site where Helm slew the avatar of Mystra during the Time of Troubles. This stretch of perilous landscape was one of a number derisively referred to as \"The Legacy of Helm\".\nHelms reach extended far beyond Faerûn, to the nation of Payit on the continent of Maztica, and even other worlds beyond Torils crystal sphere.\nthumb|right|300px|The fortified Cathedral of Helm on the Sword Coast North.\nTemples of Helm were imposing fortresses, whose architecture stressed defense and defendability. They were often built in Faerûns most dangerous regions, or near its strongholds aligned with malevolent forces, (such was the case with Darkhold near the Sunset Mountains). Within their halls were a number of barracks, armories, training grounds and, within the heart of each temple, a central altar with a suit of pristine full plate mail. Each of these sets of armor had been worn by one of Helms champions throughout history, and were considered among his holy relics.\nEach temple was extremely well-defended Helmite guards remained ever-vigilant to protect their holy houses. To aid in this feat, the church often enlisted the aid of spectators, a sub-species of even-tempered beholder-kin.\nMost major cities throughout the Realms had a temple or abbey dedicated to the Watchful One. Among these were\n*Cathedral of Helm, the fortified citadel just southeast of Neverwinter, served as an asylum to the citys Spellscarred for decades, before being repurposed by the Order of the Gilded Eye.\n* Chevangard, the stole temple-complex found in the Iltkazar Highlands.\n*Citadel of Protection, the beleaguered but resilient temple of Helm in Ravens Bluff.\n*The Guardians Post, Yhep\n*Guardtower of the God, founded by the young and famous priest Carath in Redwater.\n*House Invincible, found in Silverymoon.\n*Temple of the Vigilant Guard, located in Iljak.\n* Watchtower of the Vigilant\nAdditional temples could be found in Alaghôn, Bezantur, Elturel, Fort Beluarian, Hlondeth, Lheshayl, Reth, Teziir, Tilverton, the Hillfort of Torbold, Tsurlagol, and Waterdeep.\nIn addition, shrines to Helm could also be found in many major cities, Baldurs Gate, Cedarspoke, Espar, Ironfang Deep, Lachom, Mimph, Ormpetarr, Surkh, and Telpir.\nHelmite faith tokens allowed their bearers to utilize the spell virtue.\nWithin the Dungeon of Methegrist were two small fountains of shimmering water, referred to as the tears of Helm. This substances had renewing restorative properties and could provide illumination in dark spaces.\nClerics of Helm were armored in pristine full plate mail, often enchanted with the everbright property, complete with open-faced helmets that often featured colored plumes. Over their armor they typically carried steel-colored scabbards, wore red or steel-grey cloaks, with Helms symbol, the \"Unsleeping Eye\". While and church members donned their armor in the field and during church ceremonies, if found themself in a venue where armor was not allowed, they often kept their pauldrons and always wore their helm. Due to its inherent functional use, Helmite clerics often wore their ceremonial armor on the battlefield as well.\nIn the south, Helmite clergy inset their finely-crafted armor with gems and adorned its lining with gold filigree, particularly around the lids of the eye.\nthumb|right|100px|A tower shield adorned with the symbol of Helm.\nWhen preparing for battle, a Patriarch of Helm often used a ceremonial mace to anoit troops in holy water, referred to as the \"Tears of Helm\".\nSpells unique to or otherwise associated with the church of Helm included exaltation, forceward, mace of Odo, seeking sword sentry of Helm, summon spectator,\n*Guardians Tear, this sacred gemstone manifested after Helm killed Mystra, a symbol of the gods tremendous anguish.\n*Helm of Helm, a warhelm that had been donned by several of Helms champions granting them each great power for a time.\n*Monocle of Bagthalos, an artifact created by one of Helms most prolific and celebrated archpriests.\n*The Wall,  a powerful relic of the Church that protected its wielder from elemental harm.\nHelms faithful carried out their orders with precision and adhered to an distinct and unbending hierarchy. Only members of the churchs upper ranks took it upon themselves to interpret the churchs rigid laws and strict dogma.\nAccording to Helms law, anyone found guilty of attempted murder would suffer the loss of their hand.\nThe practice of controlling the undead, as opposed to their outright destruction, was abhorrent to the faithful of Helm.\nHelm forbade the owning of slaves among his followers. This command was ignored by the Golden Legion during their campaign in Maztica. \nNovices or initiates of the church were trained to be vigilant and dutiful in carrying out their orders. In their service, they learned to never betray the trust that was bestowed upon them, which extended to the manner in which they considered martial combat. They had to rely upon themselves, their weapons, and their allies in order to best plan and coordinate defense and attacks in battle. They trained often, crafted weapons and other armaments, and set up caches that any member of the church could access in times of need.\nWhile Helmite clergy were taught to be steadfast in their duty as guardians, they were taught not to parlay any title or rank to exert undue authority over others. They were to remain just as watchful for corruption as they were vigilant in defense of their charge.\nDevotees of Helm tended not to regard kindness or niceties in high regard, focusing more on duty and perseverance. As a result they were often seen as rigid and uncaring individuals.\nThe various orders of priests, or \"pryats\", within the church\n*Companions of the One True Vision, this group of zealous clerics and fighters and crusaders were known for their unwavering loyalty and discipline in combat before their excursion in far off lands.\n*Watchers over the Fallen, a fellowship of 11 skilled battlefield healers.\nthumb|right|300px|A paladin of Helm with his holy symbol emblazoned upon her shield.\nMany abbeys of helm maintained strong armies and sponsored various military groups, in order to defend their congregation. These included\n* Champions Vigilant, a Tethyrian order of knights founded during the early 12 century DR.\n* Everwatch Knights, the group of devout bodyguards were hired out by the church to those in need.\n*Knights of the Vigil, these dedicated knights were tasked with presiding over Watchers Keep and ensuring the Imprisoned One had no influence over the Realms.\n*Moonwatchers, a group of Helmite paladins that watched over and guarded the Moonlands in the Silver Marches.\n*Vigilant Eyes of the God, an order of paladins\n*Code Helm, an order of Helmite warriors devoted to the destruction of illithid slavers headquartered on the world of Glyth.\n*Helms Hundred, a company that operated out of Helms Hold and ventured into Hellgate Keep every year during the mid–14 century DR.\n*Vigilant Riders, led by the great Garshond, this short-lived grouping of outriders defended the roads between the cities of northern Heartlands.\nSpecialty priests of Helm were known as Watchers, or Godseyes. They were stalwart battle-priests that wore full plate mail, were granted exceptional combat training, and wielded potent defensive and offensive magic. \nThe Bulwarks were those priests that worked tirelessly to restore Helms Good name when the church suffered a crisis of followers during the mid–14 century DR. Questers were champions of Helm that set out to recover long-lost artifacts or rescue individuals that had been taken captive against their will.\nDespite sharing similar doctrines, priests from the churches of Helm and Torm shared an unfriendly and rivalrous relationship with one another.\nFor many years the Helmite faith was one of the most highly respected across the Realms, especially in the North.\nIn the mid-13 century, great Helmite cleric, Garshond, led the defense of Iriaebor from a goblinoid army. Following the battle, the battle-priest was presented with the Helm of Helm, which rose out of a nearby bog and seemingly chose him as its new wearer. Donning the ancient relic, Garshond returned to the Watchtower of the Vigilant, a lone keep found in nearby scrublands, which surrounded the long-ruined town of Harkstag.\nFrom the sentry-like outpost, Garshond reached out to the rich, noble families of Waterdeep, Iriaebor and Scornubel, and invited them to his stronghold for a meeting of minds regarding the protection of the northern heartlands and the Sword Coast North. This assembly came to be known as the first Council of Helm, which saw the formation of the Vigilant Riders. These elite guardians would protect the region for several years, and helped ensure welfare for the small villages and hamlets as far south as Baldurs Gate.\nHelmite knights played an important role in maintaining order in Tethyr during the years of the Tethyrian Interregnum.\nDuring the Time of Troubles in the , Helm was the one deity allowed by Ao to retain his divine powers. He was tasked with preventing the avatars of other gods from ascending the Celestial Stairway to access other planes of the multiverse.\nAfter the Time of Troubles, the reputation of Helm and his clergy were heavily tarnished across most of Faerûn.\nIn response the church crafted stories that declared these \"falsehoods\" about Helms faith were the work of various evil faiths, spread by the churches of Bane, Cyric, and Shar, meant to destabilize the Realms. Clergy members were offered promotions within the church for every high-ranking priest or priestess of those faiths they slew. Many of them became overly-zealous and even fanatical in their persecution of these admittingly self-serving faiths.\nWord of the \"discovery\" of a new land far to the west of the Moonshae Isles was spread far and wide by Helms devoted followers in the . The colony of New Amn was founded the following year, in the . Inexplicably immune to the distrust and weariness in four years following the Avatar Crisis, the Amnian church of Helm said the occasion  would mark a new blessed age for their faith.\nA few years later, in the , the Waterdhavian branch of the church, along with the Adarbrent, Helmfast, Jardeth and Raventree noble families sponsored a transoceanic expedition of twelve ships across the Trackless Sea to the land of Maztica. While they were turned away at Helmsport by the Lord-Governor of New Amn, the colonists settled on Maztapan Island, and opened lines of trade and negotiation with the native Kultakan people. Within months they formed the colony of New Waterdeep, and after forging further north, the second settlement of Trythosford.\nAt some point, the Helmite knights known as Companions of the One True Vision slaughtered many native Maztican people. This order was scorned across Faerûn, and many of their guilt-ridden brothers atoned for their sins by serving among the altruistic order, the Vigilant Eyes of the God. Many others simply became much more cautious when carrying out Helms will in the Realms.\nthumb|300px|A Helmite paladin.\nSome twenty years later, a tragic misunderstanding that broke out between the gods of the Upper planes led to devastation of Helms church in the Realms. As the gods Tyr and Tymora were proposed to be united, they began a courtship that was overseen under Helms watchful eye. Under some unknown circumstances, Tyr came to believe that Helm had wooed Tymora while offering her his own sentiments. In the , Tyr was forced in accordance of his own ethos to slay his longtime friend Helm, and strike the God of Guardians from the Faerûnian pantheon.\nIn the century following his death, Helms followers stopped receiving signs from their god. Many of them forsook their vows and local shrines in major cities were left abandoned. However, faith in Helm did not disappear from the Realms completely.\nThe Cathedral of Helm, which had yet to be completely built when its patron deity was killed, remained open throughout the late 14 and 15 centuries DR. It became a bastion of hope for those unfortunate souls that were afflicted by the horrors of the Spellplague. A new prophet of Helm by the name of Rohini emerged to lead the Cathedral in the late 1470s, However, Rohini was actually a fiend from the Nine Hells, dispatched by garner information about the Realms for her devilish superiors. Eventually Rohini was revealed as the fiend and fraud she was, and Javen Tarmikos. While in the chapel, the devout Javen received a sign of Helms return his holy symbol of Helms Unblinking Eye wept tears of gold. Some faithful flocked to Helms Hold to witness the miracle, while others remained skeptical about the entire phenomenon.\nHelm finally reappeared in the Realms during the world-altering events of the Second Sundering. In the , the God of Guardians manifested before one of his most devout and loyal followers, his chosen Kleef Kenric, as he ventured across the Underchasm to Sadrachs Spire. Within a few years his power was restored to the Faerûnian pantheon.\n*Lord Royal Chancellor Alaric Hembreon, Duke of the Golden Marches in Tethyr.\n*Anomen Delryn, a squire of the Order of the Radiant Heart and member of the Radiant Heart Auxiliary.\n* Breyarg Stonebreaker, a Great Rift paladin of Gorm Gulthyn and Fellow of the Purple Staff that fought in the name of Helms church.\n* High Rider Lord Dhelt, the once-leader of the Hellriders and governor of the holy city of Elturel.\n*Dumal Erard, adventurer of the Company of Crazed Venturers, founder of Helms Hold, and White Master of Dragons of the Citadel of the Mists.\n*Holy Watcher Qerria, head priestess of Helms Cathedral and leader of the Order of the Gilded Eye.\n* Rhordren Thardras, the Archancel that defied church doctrine by declaring some Vigilators should be allowed to command others during times of crisis.\n*Shilau Mwenye, the priest of Helms temple in Fort Beluarian in Chult.\n*Watcher Tonorak Winthrax, head priest of Iljak in the Vilhon Reach.\n*Zern Xerkstil, an agent of the Order of the Gauntlet that operated throughout the Moonsea region during the 15 century."
