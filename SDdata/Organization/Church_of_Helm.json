They dedicated themselves to the protection of those who could not protect themselves and shared their skills and tenets with the guardians and defenders of [[Faerûn]], and beyond.",
        "Organization": {
            "Factions": "While not an official arm of Helm's church ''per se'', there was a group known as the [[Eye of Justice]] that worshiped Helm alongside the deities [[Tyr]] and [[Torm]]. This belief was known as the [[Heresy of the Threefold God]].{{Page needed}}",
            "Titles": "''Circa'' the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], titles within the church included (in descending order): \n:Bishous, Senior Steeleye, High Watcher, Overblade, Guardian, Watcher, Watchknight, Alert, Trusty, Adept, and Novice.\n\nBy the late 15{{th}} century, the church's titles had changed to:\n:Chancels, each of whom directly served the Archancels; Bishous, each of whom presided over a single realm; Lectors, local commanders and investigators; Ardeacons; Prelates; Vicarphs; Pyrats, or priests; Novices; and Honored Laity, officers within the church that were not members of Helm's clergy.",

The church sponsored the training of guards and armed escorts in various cities throughout the realms, extolling their virtues and worthiness as the only guardians that were worthy for hire. Anyone found violating Helmite protectorship by slaying one of his faithful were often blacklisted from enlisting the church's services.\n\nThe clergy of Helm would take in anyone who sought sanctuary within the walls of their fortified churches, persecuted and criminally accused alike. Those running from the authorities would be turned over to local law enforcement, though the presiding Helmite priest would ensure a fair and just trial.",
        "Rituals": "One of the holiest of the Helmite rituals was the [[consecration of a Postulant]], performed upon the confirmation of a person's dedication as they entered into the ranks of the Helmite clergy. Others included the [[consecration of a Glymtul]], was used to dedicate items into service unto Helm; the purification, a ritual of atonement when clergy  returned to the faith after leaving its service, or otherwise failed in their duties; and the [[Holy Vigil]], a night-long ceremony was performed by a priest of Helm when they ascended in rank within the church.\n\nHelmite priests prayed for their spells either in the morning or at night, soon after waking or shortly before bed.",
        "Celebrations": "The faithful of Helm celebrated their devotion with the [[Ceremony to Honor Helm]] on [[Shieldmeet]]. They held no other annual observances or holidays.",

            "Regions": "Veneration of Helm was prevalent across Faerûn, including the realms of [[Chessenta]], [[Cormyr]], the [[Dragon Coast]], the [[Silver Marches]], [[Tethyr]], [[Thay]], the [[Vilhon Reach]],\n\nThe [[Helmlands]] of [[Cormyr]] were named after the god Helm. It was a troubled and tarnished landscape, permeated with [[wild magic]], and [[dead-magic zone]]s, having been the site where Helm slew the [[avatar]] of [[Mystra]] during the [[Time of Troubles]]. This stretch of perilous landscape was one of a number derisively referred to as \"The Legacy of Helm\".\n\nHelm's reach extended far beyond Faerûn, to the nation of [[Payit]] on the continent of [[Maztica]], and even [[Glyth|other worlds]] beyond [[Toril]]'s [[crystal sphere]].",
            "Temples": "[[File:Helms hold.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The fortified [[Cathedral of Helm]] on the [[Sword Coast North]].]]\nTemples of Helm were imposing fortresses, whose architecture stressed defense and defendability. They were often built in Faerûn's most dangerous regions, or near its strongholds aligned with malevolent forces, (such was the case with [[Darkhold]] near the [[Sunset Mountains]]). Within their halls were a number of barracks, armories, training grounds and, within the heart of each temple, a central altar with a suit of pristine [[full plate]] mail. Each of these sets of armor had been worn by one of Helm's champions throughout history, and were considered among his holy [[relic]]s.\n\nEach temple was extremely well-defended; Helmite guards remained ever-vigilant to protect their holy houses. To aid in this feat, the church often enlisted the aid of [[spectator]]s, a sub-species of even-tempered [[beholder]]-kin.\n\nMost major cities throughout the Realms had a temple or abbey dedicated to the Watchful One. Among these were:\n*[[Cathedral of Helm]], the fortified citadel just southeast of [[Neverwinter]], served as an asylum to the city's [[Spellscarred]] for decades, before being repurposed by the [[Order of the Gilded Eye]].\n* [[Chevangard]], the stole temple-complex found in the [[Iltkazar Highlands]].\n*[[Citadel of Protection]], the beleaguered but resilient temple of Helm in [[Ravens Bluff]].\n*The [[Guardian's Post]], [[Yhep]]\n*[[Guardtower of the God]], founded by the young and famous priest [[Carath]] in [[Redwater]].\n*[[House Invincible]], found in [[Silverymoon]].\n*[[Temple of the Vigilant Guard]], located in [[Iljak]].\n* [[Watchtower of the Vigilant]]\n\nAdditional temples could be found in [[Alaghôn]], [[Bezantur]], [[Helm's Shieldhall|Elturel]], [[Fort Beluarian]], [[Hlondeth]], [[Lheshayl]], [[Reth]], [[Teziir]], [[Tilverton]], the [[Hillfort]] of [[Hall of the Guardians|Torbold]], [[Noble Hand|Tsurlagol]], and [[Helm's Hall|Waterdeep]].\n\nIn addition, shrines to Helm could also be found in many major cities, [[Watchful Shield (shrine)|Baldur's Gate]], [[Cedarspoke]], [[Sentinel Rock|Espar]], [[Ironfang Deep]], [[Lachom]], [[Mimph]], [[Ormpetarr]], [[Surkh]], and [[Telpir]]."

While and church members donned their armor in the field and during church ceremonies, if found themself in a venue where armor was not allowed, they often kept their pauldrons and always wore their helm. Due to its inherent functional use, Helmite clerics often wore their ceremonial armor on the battlefield as well.\n\nIn [[South Faerûn|the south]], Helmite clergy inset their finely-crafted armor with [[gem]]s and adorned its lining with [[gold]] filigree, particularly around the lids of the eye.",
            "Weapons and Arms": "[[File:Helm tower shield.png|thumb|right|100px|''A [[tower shield]] adorned with the symbol of Helm.'']]\nWhen preparing for battle, a Patriarch of Helm often used a ceremonial [[mace]] to anoit troops in [[holy water]], referred to as the \"Tears of Helm\".",

        "Dogma": {
            "Beliefs": "Helm's faithful carried out their orders with precision and adhered to an distinct and unbending hierarchy. Only members of the church's upper ranks took it upon themselves to interpret the church's rigid laws and strict dogma.\n\nAccording to Helm's law, anyone found guilty of attempted murder would suffer the loss of their hand.\n\nThe practice of controlling the [[undead]], as opposed to their outright destruction, was abhorrent to the faithful of Helm.\n\nHelm forbade the owning of slaves among his followers. This command was ignored by the [[Golden Legion]] during their campaign in Maztica. <ref>",
            "Attitudes": "{{Quote|Our zeal is oft our undoing. We see the flaws in those we guard...and in our seeking we stray over the line into tyranny, or into causing strife, and so drift from the purpose and grace of Helm.|Ardeacon [[Baeryk Halholdaun]], [[1236 DR]].}}\n\nNovices or initiates of the church were trained to be vigilant and dutiful in carrying out their orders. In their service, they learned to never betray the trust that was bestowed upon them, which extended to the manner in which they considered martial combat. They had to rely upon themselves, their [[weapon]]s, and their allies in order to best plan and coordinate defense and attacks in battle. They trained often, crafted weapons and other armaments, and set up caches that any member of the church could access in times of need.\n\nWhile Helmite clergy were taught to be steadfast in their duty as guardians, they were taught not to parlay any title or rank to exert undue authority over others. They were to remain just as watchful for corruption as they were vigilant in defense of their charge.\n\nDevotees of Helm tended not to regard kindness or niceties in high regard, focusing more on duty and perseverance. As a result they were often seen as rigid and uncaring individuals."

They were stalwart battle-priests that wore [[full plate]] mail, were granted exceptional combat training, and wielded potent defensive and offensive magic. \n\nThe [[Bulwarks]] were those priests that worked tirelessly to restore Helm's Good name when the church suffered a crisis of followers during the mid–14{{th}} century DR. [[Quester]]s were champions of Helm that set out to recover long-lost [[artifact]]s or rescue individuals that had been taken captive against their will.",
        "Relationships": "Despite sharing similar doctrines, priests from the churches of Helm and [[church of Torm|Torm]] shared an unfriendly and rivalrous relationship with one another.",
        "History": {
            "Formation of the Council": "For many years the Helmite faith was one of the most highly respected across the Realms, especially in [[the North]].\n\nIn the mid-13{{th}} century, great Helmite cleric, [[Garshond]], led the defense of [[Iriaebor]] from a [[goblinoid]] army. Following the battle, the battle-priest was presented with the [[Helm of Helm]], which rose out of a nearby bog and seemingly chose him as its new wearer. Donning the ancient relic, Garshond returned to the [[Watchtower of the Vigilant]], a lone keep found in nearby scrublands, which surrounded the long-ruined town of [[Harkstag]].\n\nFrom the sentry-like outpost, Garshond reached out to the rich, noble families of [[Waterdeep]], Iriaebor and [[Scornubel]], and invited them to his stronghold for a meeting of minds regarding the protection of the northern [[Western Heartlands|heartlands]] and the [[Sword Coast North]]. This assembly came to be known as the first [[Council of Helm]], which saw the formation of the [[Vigilant Riders]]. These elite guardians would protect the region for several years, and helped ensure welfare for the small villages and hamlets as far south as [[Baldur's Gate]].\n\nHelmite knights played an important role in maintaining order in Tethyr during the years of the [[Tethyrian Interregnum]].",
            "Time of Troubles": "During the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, Helm was the one deity allowed by [[Ao]] to retain his divine powers. He was tasked with preventing the avatars of other gods from ascending the [[Celestial Stairway]] to access other planes of the [[multiverse]].\n\nAfter the Time of Troubles, the reputation of Helm and his clergy were heavily tarnished across most of Faerûn.\n\nIn response the church crafted stories that declared these \"falsehoods\" about Helm's faith were the work of various evil faiths, spread by the [[church of Bane|churches of Bane]], [[church of Cyric|Cyric]], and [[church of Shar|Shar]], meant to destabilize the Realms. Clergy members were offered promotions within the church for every high-ranking priest or priestess of those faiths they slew. Many of them became overly-zealous and even fanatical in their persecution of these admittingly self-serving faiths.",
            "Involvement in Maztica": "{{Quote|The New World? Aye, much has gone on there of (late). Not all the natives hate the newcomers, but they have learned wisdom and caution in dealing with all [[Faerûn]]ians, and they learn more with each new ship that hits their shores...Only fair [[Tymora]] or the natives' [[Kiltzi]] knows what will happen next in [[Maztica]].|[[Varnos Sebblal]], boatswain of the [[Hippocampus (ship)|Hippocampus]].}}\n\nWord of the \"discovery\" of a new land far to the west of the [[Moonshae Isles]] was spread far and wide by Helm's devoted followers in the {{YearlinkName|1361}}. The colony of [[New Amn]] was founded the following year, in the {{YearlinkName|1362}}. Inexplicably immune to the distrust and weariness in four years following the Avatar Crisis, the Amnian church of Helm said the occasion  would mark a new blessed age for their faith.\n\nA few years later, in the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, the [[Waterdhavian]] branch of the church, along with the [[Adarbrent]], [[Helmfast]], [[Jardeth]] and [[Raventree]] noble families sponsored a transoceanic expedition of twelve ships across the [[Trackless Sea]] to the land of Maztica. While they were turned away at [[Helmsport]] by the Lord-Governor of [[New Amn]], the colonists settled on [[Maztapan Island]], and opened lines of trade and negotiation with the native [[Kultakan]] people. Within months they formed the colony of [[New Waterdeep]], and after forging further north, the second settlement of [[Trythosford]].\n\nAt some point, the Helmite knights known as [[Companions of the One True Vision]] slaughtered many native Maztican people. This order was scorned across Faerûn, and many of their guilt-ridden brothers atoned for their sins by serving among the altruistic order, the [[Vigilant Eyes of the God]]. Many others simply became much more cautious when carrying out Helm's will in the Realms.",
            "Helm's Death and Rebirth": "[[File:Paladin - Warriors & Weapons.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Helmite paladin.'']]\nSome twenty years later, a tragic misunderstanding that broke out between the gods of the [[Upper planes]] led to devastation of Helm's church in the Realms. As the gods [[Tyr]] and [[Tymora]] were proposed to be united, they began a courtship that was overseen under Helm's watchful eye. Under some unknown circumstances, Tyr came to believe that Helm had wooed Tymora while offering her his own sentiments. In the {{YearlinkName|1384}}, Tyr was forced in accordance of his own ethos to slay his longtime friend Helm, and strike the God of Guardians from the [[Faerûnian pantheon]].\n\nIn the century following his death, Helm's followers stopped receiving signs from their god. Many of them forsook their vows and local shrines in major cities were left abandoned. However, faith in Helm did not disappear from the Realms completely.\n\nThe [[Cathedral of Helm]], which had yet to be completely built when its patron deity was killed, remained open throughout the late 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries DR. It became a bastion of hope for those unfortunate souls that were afflicted by the horrors of the [[Spellplague]]. A new prophet of Helm by the name of [[Rohini]] emerged to lead the Cathedral in the late 1470s, However, Rohini was actually a [[succubus|fiend]] from the [[Nine Hells]], dispatched by garner information about the Realms for her [[devil]]ish superiors. Eventually Rohini was revealed as the fiend and fraud she was, and [[Javen Tarmikos]]. While in the chapel, the devout Javen received a sign of Helm's return: his [[holy symbol]] of Helm's Unblinking Eye wept tears of gold. Some faithful flocked to Helm's Hold to witness the miracle, while others remained skeptical about the entire phenomenon.\n\nHelm finally reappeared in the Realms during the world-altering events of the [[Second Sundering]]. In the {{YearlinkName|1486}}, the God of Guardians manifested before one of his most devout and loyal followers, his [[chosen]] [[Kleef Kenric]], as he ventured across the [[Underchasm]] to [[Sadrach's Spire]]. Within a few years his power was restored to the Faerûnian pantheon."
