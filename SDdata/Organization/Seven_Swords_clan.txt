The '''Ito family''', more colloquially known as the '''Seven Swords clan''', was a noble family in [[Maeshi Province]] in [[Kozakura]] until [[647 DR]].

==History==
The Ito family started with [[Ito no Juro]] who, around [[24 DR]], led a wing of the army of Prince [[Miki]] in battling the local [[korobokuru]] in Maeshi. Around [[31 DR]], Juro's brother [[Ito no Saburo Takanori]] was granted governorship of Maeshi and [[Kanahanto Province]]s by the prince. Miki died in the great korobukuru counteroffensive led by [[Inoyep]] in [[32 DR]] and Takanori was besieged in his fort but at last gave his own daughter [[Shen]] to [[Akarweop]], a local korobokuru chieftain, to end the siege. In [[34 DR]], thanks to Takanori's daughter's manipulations, Akarweop and other chieftains were captured and put to death by Emperor [[Itonin]].

Around [[207 DR]], Lord [[Ito Kajo]] divided the provinces of Maeshi and Kanahanto up between his two sons, [[Ito Manju|Manju]] and [[Ito Kunitake|Kunitake]]. In [[211 DR]], Manju killed Kunitake with [[poison]] but the emperor and his vassals denounced him and he lost all his titles and inheritances and was subsequently slain by Kunitake's son, [[Ito Tokiharu]]. Afterward, Tokiharu was granted governorship of only Maeshi.

Around [[312 DR]], Lord [[Ito Moriyasu]] refused to force the korobokuru out of Maeshi like all the other lords, so they gifted him with the [[Seven Swords]]. The family seal even changed to seven joined swords after them.

Around [[546 DR]], the [[Nambu family]], a branch of the Ito family, split from the main clan. For the next seventeen years, they feuded over possession of the Seven Swords. Finally, around [[563 DR]], the Nambu won the swords and control of Maeshi, and the Ito were exiled. However, in [[581 DR]], the Nambu sided with the losing side in the [[Zakura Insurrection]] and the Ito regained everything.

Its misfortunes started when, in [[639 DR]], the lordship of Ito went to [[Ito Saburo]], a greedy man secretly manipulated by a [[demon]] [[spirit]], a [[Krakentua (Ito-jo)|krakentua]]. In order to destroy his Nambu enemies, Saburo founded the [[Sun Temple]] in Maeshi in [[644 DR]], and agreed to sacrifice one of the Seven Swords to the krakentua in [[646 DR]].

However, in [[647 DR]], despite the extinction of the Nambu clan, the [[sohei]] of the Sun Temple burned the castle to the ground on the [[Night of Burning Flowers]] and all the Ito family and their retainers were slain.
