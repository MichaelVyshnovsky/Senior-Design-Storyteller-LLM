The '''Hethcanter''' clan of [[Cormyr]] was a powerful family who did not possess hereditary titles of nobility but held wealth, titles, and status within the Forest Kingdom and its capital city of [[Suzail]].

==Organization==
The Hethcanter family was ever-present in Suzail, and its members held local civic posts and Court posts and even received knightly titles.

==History==
The Hethcanter family descended from [[Hethcanter]], the [[mage]]. However, there were supposedly unrelated Hethcanter families in [[Sembia]], [[Tsurlagol]], and [[Telflamm]]. One notable member of the family was Lord [[Oratham Hethcanter]], the garrison commander of [[High Horn]] who was active during the rule of King [[Rhigaerd Obarskyr II]] that ended in the {{YearlinkName|
1335}}. In the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], the Hethcanter family had three royal knights that battled alongside Cormyr's [[Purple Dragons]]. As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Lady of Graces [[Brunzarra Hethcanter|Brunzarra]] and [[Ildra Hethcanter]] were family's representatives in the Court of Cormyr, alongside [[Lyrele Hethcanter]] who served the crown in a clandestine manner. [[Paresper Hethcanter]] of [[Immersea]] ended his successful adventuring career, and in the late 15{{th}} century DR, he purchased a share in the ownership of the fortified [[Nightgate Inn]] in the capital. Paresper's father, [[Rharvuld Hethcanter]] was a renowned furniture maker whose craft was in high demand in Suzail.
