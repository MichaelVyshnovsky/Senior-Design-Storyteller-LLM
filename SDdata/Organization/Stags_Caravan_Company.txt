The '''Stags Caravan Company''' was a merchant company based in [[Scornubel]]in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Organization==
The Stag was led by the trail-lord Black [[Tomm Bharhinn]] but effective control of the day-to-day operations gradually fell into the hands of three young [[Amn]]ianÂ merchants [[Storm (merchant)|Storm]], [[Hlevell]], and [[Dindar Pel]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
Originally the Stag were an adventuring company but in time the original adventurer members were replaced by new merchant members and when all the original members were dead or left for other adventures, the Stag became a full merchant company.
