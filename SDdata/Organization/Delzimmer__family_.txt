The Delzimmer clan was a family in Waterdeep around 1373 DR.
The Delzimmers townhouse was an opulent four-story row-house building on the Swords Street in the Castle Ward, adjacent to Sapphire House. Adjoining it to the north was Sablehearth, the Irlingstar mansion.
On Uktar 28, 1374 DR, the rogue Raegar Stoneblade fled from Kemarn Darkthrush along the balcony of the Delzimmers house, as well as over the neighboring houses.
