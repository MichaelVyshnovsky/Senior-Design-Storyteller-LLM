The '''Delzimmer''' clan was a family in [[Waterdeep]] around [[1373 DR]].

The Delzimmers' townhouse was an opulent four-story row-house building on the [[Swords Street]] in the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]], adjacent to [[Sapphire House]]. Adjoining it to the north was [[Sablehearth]], the [[Irlingstar]] mansion.

On [[Uktar 28]], [[1374 DR]], the [[rogue]] [[Raegar Stoneblade]] fled from [[Kemarn Darkthrush]] along the balcony of the Delzimmers' house, as well as over the neighboring houses.
