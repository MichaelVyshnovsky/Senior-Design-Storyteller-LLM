        "mainbody": "The Swamp Scale Tribe was a lizardfolk tribe located in Surmarsh in Thay. In the 1330s DR, it had allegiance to the black dragon Insithryllax.\nIn 1335 DR, the young Red Wizard Marek Rym√ºt came to the Surmarsh with a company of Thayan mages and warriors under the orders of the Tharchion of Eltabbar to collect 1000 gold pieces in taxes that were owed by the Swamp Scale Tribe. The tribe inhabited Thayan territory but it had chosen to serve the black dragon Insithryllax, which Marek learned in the course of his mission in the swamp.\nThe lizardfolk went to battle with Mareks force, but the Thayan soldiers were victorious. Insithryllax then revealed himself and killed all of the Thayans except for Marek, who succeeded in using a charm monster spell to enthrall the black dragon."
