'''Clan Orothiar''' was a clan of [[hill dwarves]] that experienced great misfortune during their years spent mining the Realms of [[Faer√ªn]].

==Activities==
The dwarves of Clan Orothiar were experienced albeit unlucky miners, skilled smiths, and talented stonemasons.

==Base of Operations==
Throughout their history, the Orothiar dwarves were known to have two ancestral homes: one in [[Bloodstone Lands]], and another on the [[Sword Coast]]. 

Some of their kin had settled into the lands of [[the North]].

==Relationships==
The Orothiar dwarves of Bloodstone had an amiable but estranged relationship with the villagers of the [[Bloodstone Barony]].

==History==
At one point, Clan Orothiar made their residence beneath the [[Galena Mountains]] within the [[Bloodstone Mines]].
Unfortunately they delved too deep and awoke a terribly evil power. Many of the dwarves were slain; those who survived either fled the region or found modest lives as shepherds in the western peaks of the mountain range.While it is not stated that this event occurs before those described in the [[Baldur's Gate (game)|Baldur's Gate video game]], it is assumed for the purpose of this article.

By the {{YearlinkName|1243}}, Orothiar dwarves had found a home within a system of [[Cloak Wood mine|mines]] deep beneath the [[Cloak Wood]] forest. Yet again, the miners went too far beneath the surface of [[Toril]]. They broke into an underground river that flooded the mines and killed nearly all of their kin.

Following the [[Bloodstone Wars]] in the {{YearlinkName|1357}}, Clan Orothiar attained a seat on the newly-formed [[Council of Bloodstone]].

The clan was still active as of the {{YearlinkName|1489}}, at least in the region of the North.

==Notable Members==
* [[Tokan]], chief of the Orothiar dwarves that still lived in the Bloodstone valley.
* [[Yeslick Orothiar|Yeslick]], one of the refugees who fled the Cloak Wood mines.
