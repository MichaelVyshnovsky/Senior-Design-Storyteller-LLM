The Fellowship of the Forgotten Flower was a loosely structured elven knightly order that operated on mainland Faerûn.
The Fellowship was dedicated to recovering lost elven relics from long-abandoned elven realms.
With the majority of elven knighthoods having migrated to Evermeet following the Retreat, the Fellowships choice to remain on mainland Faerûn made them one of the most frequently encountered elven knighthoods on the continent outside of elven lands.
