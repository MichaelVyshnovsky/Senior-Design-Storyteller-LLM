        "mainbody": "Bregan Daerthe () was an elite drow mercenary and later mercantile group founded and led by Jarlaxle, primarily based in Menzoberranzan in the Underdark. \nBregan Daerthe was primarily a mercenary and mercantile band. Members, both individuals and the band as a whole, were available for hire to the highest bidder. Bregan Daerthe was involved in most conflicts in Menzoberranzan in one way or another. For example, they traded Netherese artifacts to Menzoberranzan via Luskan.\nBregan Daerthe was also an information broker, willing to provide information for both sides of a conflict—for the right price. Its contacts reached even as far as the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone.\nBregan Daerthe had a reputation that normally allowed its agents to skip lines. Its members were given \"credit\" — often they didnt need to pay because of the threat of retaliation from Bregan Daerthe.\nBregan Daerthes main headquarters were hidden in the Clawrift in Menzoberranzan. However, they had a number of smaller headquarters and hide-outs in many locations throughout Menzoberranan and Ched Nasad.\nThe band established a presence on the surface in order to further the bands influence as well as trade for Menzoberranzan. In 1366 DR, it briefly had a surface base in Calimport. \nBy 1377 DR, Bregan Daerthe had developed a significant surface presence in Luskan and used Ship Kurth as its outward face. Bregan Daerthe headquarters in Luskan were underground in Illusk. There was a path that connected the base to Closeguard Isle and Ship Kurth. Jarlaxle had a private room in this base.\nthumb|Bregan Daerthe in the Dock Ward of Waterdeep.\nMembers of Bregan Daerthe carried an insignia of the band that was widely recognized throughout the Underdark, including in Sschindylryn. Unlike a house insignia, the Bregan Daerthe insignia did not always allow its bearer to levitate, however (although in 1484 DR, Braelin Janquay was able to use his insignia to do so).\nValas Hune had an upside-down cameo trinket of deep green jade that allowed him to send messages to his band when he touched it. Whether this trinket was the same as his insignia was unclear.\nIn the late 15 century DR, the organization had acquired the Lantanese submarine Scarlet Marpenoth, which was employed as a secret base for Jarlaxle.\nBregan Daerthe enjoyed relative freedom from the Ruling Council, mostly because of its close relationship with House Baenre (into which Jarlaxle had in fact been born). The relationship began with Matron Yvonnel Baenre but continued with her successors, Triel and later Quenthel Baenre.\nIn the late fifteenth century DR, Bregan Daerthe became concerned about the expansion of the Jaezred Chaulssin, viewing them as religious zealots and fearing that the group would draw away potential Bregan Daerthe recruits. \nAmong the houses of Menzoberranzan, Bregan Daerthe was concerned about the fast growth of House Hunzrin, led by Matron Shakti Hunzrin. Although Jarlaxle was able to have a firm grip on most mercantile operations in the city, he failed to be able to reign in the growth of the Hunzrins mercantile empire.\nthumb|250px|Jarlaxle, the leader of Bregan Daerthe.\nBregan Daerthe was founded by the houseless rogue Jarlaxle, choosing to separate from the matriarchal drow society. It was built of mainly rogue drow males from destroyed houses of Menzoberranzan and Ched Nasad. It was widely employed by the ruling houses of Menzoberranzan, especially by House Baenre, which had the resources to hire the group regularly, particularly given that Jarlaxle himself was a Baenre.\nThe group soon had an important role on major events at Menzoberranzan for instance, it was hired by House DoUrden to assist on the attack on the fifth house, House Hunett, and it played a significant role in the demise of House DoUrden.\nJarlaxle begins the organization slowly having Arathis Hune as his first Lieutenant.\nIn 1018 DR Jarlaxle and Arathis Hune took part on a raid of House Simfray and were paid to acquire Zaknafein Simfray as a weaponsmaster for House DoUrden and patron for Malice DoUrden.\nFrom time to time Zaknafein DoUrden was later used in other Bregan Daerthe operations.\nThrough mercenary opportunities in house to house infighting - the opportunity to acquire houseless rogues for the organization results in doubled membership by 1118 DR. The rise in membership and demonstrated effectiveness of the band afforded it more respect and fear amongst matron mothers of the city. In order to protect the organization during this delicate time Jarlaxle chose to stay in Menzoberranzan and send Arathis Hune on jobs in Ched Nessad when required. For the first time ever the band has a castoff priestess as a part of its resources.\nIn 1118 DR Year of the False Bargain, Jarlaxle celebrated 15 decades of Bregan Daerthe but particularly the previous 100 years of growth. Conflicts and jealousy ensued as did attention to one of the affiliates of the band Zaknafein DoUrden. In order to keep internal tensions down Jarlaxle enlisted a young Kimmuriel Oblodra a position in the band as a second lieutenant.  Conspiracy within the organization and from without by House Barrison DelArmgo tests Jarlaxles leadership and results in the death of Arathis Hune who had performed vital services of the organization.\nIn 1358 DR, Bregan Daerthe played a role in the drow attack on Mithral Hall. After the battle was over, the illithid advisor to Matron Yvonnel Baenre, Methil El-Viddenvelp, was believed dead. However, in truth he had been badly injured but was rescued by Bregan Daerthe and brought back to the tunnels outside of the city, where he remained for more than a century, advising the band and serving as an object of study for Kimmuriel Oblodra, a psion and one of the bands leaders.\nCirca 1360 DR, House Xorlarrin hired Bregan Daerthe to help protect the Lustrum mines.\nIn 1366 DR, Bregan Daerthe briefly expanded to a surface base in Calimport, in part due to the influence of Crenshinibon on Jarlaxle. The human Artemis Entreri helped the group make contacts in Calimport. By 1377 DR, Bregan Daerthe had developed a significant surface presence in Luskan and used Ship Kurth as its outward face.\nDuring Jarlaxle and Artemis Entreris exploits in the Bloodstone Lands (around 1368 DR), Kimmuriel increasingly took more command of Bregan Daerthe while its main leader was gone.\nIn 1369 DR, Bregan Daerthe acted in Ust Natha in connection with House Jaellat and Deirex the lich.\nDuring the Siege of Menzoberranzan (1372-1373 DR), Bregan Daerthe provided intelligence on the siege for city leaders. Jarlaxle, however, was not in the city at the time. Meanwhile, Bregan Daerthe agent Valas Hune was investigating the Silence of Lolth, having been hired by Matron Mother Triel Baenre to escort Quenthel Baenres expedition through the Underdark.\nIn 1376-1377 DR Bregan Daerthe played a role in the fall of the Host Tower of the Arcane in Luskan and the subsequent grapple for dominance between Captain Deudermont, who was supported by Waterdhavian nobles and the High Captains. They secured trade relations with Luskan during this incident, aligning with Ship Kurth. Jarlaxle later used that connection to make a deal with Marchion Elastul Raurym, opening trade with the city of Mirabar.\nthumb|200px|A 15 century Bregan Daerthe spy in Neverwinter.\nIn 1466 DR, Bregan Daerthe, at the bequest of Jarlaxle, assaulted Draygo Quicks compound in Gloomwrought in the Shadowfell to free his prisoners Drizzt DoUrden and the petrified Dahlia Sinfelle and Artemis Entreri. In 1469 DR, Draygo Quick was continuing to work with Bregan Daerthe Kimmuriel Oblodra had agreed to share information he gathered from working with the illithids in return for forgiveness for the assault on Quicks home.\nBregan Daerthe had made strong headway in Luskan. By 1483 DR, the drow agent Beniago, disguised as a human, was High Captain Kurth. Bregan Daerthe also had its eyes set on the city of Neverwinter. It retained a number of agents in the city in order to maintain an understanding of the forces at play and pounce on an opportunity for profit, should it arise.\nIn 1484 DR, Bregan Daerthe was hired by Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre to clean up House DoUrden in Menzoberranzan, as well as to make up the garrison for that house. For a brief time, two-thirds of the members of Bregan Daerthe were serving in the garrison, until Jarlaxle began swapping them out and sending them back to Luskan. Jarlaxle was assigned the title of Captain of the Guard, although he bribed Gromph Baenre with psionics lessons from Kimmuriel to get out of his duties and escape the city.\nthumb|326x326px|A member of Bregan Daerthe.\nMost of the bands members were males from destroyed houses, primarily fighters, thieves, and mages, with very few members having clerical powers. Although the band had some non-drow members (particularly hobgoblins and bugbears), exceptions were made on occasion but only drow members could achieve the highest ranks.\nAfter the debacle with Crenshinibon in 1366 DR, Jarlaxle left the organization in the capable hands of his trusted lieutenant Kimmuriel Oblodra and adventured on the surface with Artemis Entreri. Kimmuriel longed for a time when he could return to his lieutenant status and let Jarlaxle take over again, allowing him to return to his personal psionic studies.\nSome time after his adventures in the Bloodstone Lands, Jarlaxle returned and resumed his throne as leader of Bregan Daerthe, still working in the shadows of society to establish trade and profits from the surface world, particularly in Luskan. and indeed Jarlaxle undertook missions for Kimmuriel and paid him for the services of Bregan Daerthe when he wished to use the band for personal missions. However, by 1484 DR, with Kimmuriel away at an illithids hive, Jarlaxle was once again seen as an equal co-leader with Kimmuriel.\nAfter the expansion of Bregan Daerthe, it was broken up into a number of cells led by lieutenants of equal standing, each of whom was given jurisdiction over an area of interest for the group. The cells were, for the most part, independent, although they still gave allegiance to Jarlaxle and Kimmuriel. For example, Beniago was the lieutenant largely responsible for Luskan. \nthumb|right|300px|Valas Hune, Kimmuriel Oblodra, Jarlaxle, and Rai-guy Bondalek, of Bregan Daerthe.\nDrow\n* Jarlaxle, founder.\n* Arathis Hune, First lieutenant, Assassin, and operative to Ched Nessad.
