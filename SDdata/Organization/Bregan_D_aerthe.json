        "mainbody": "'''Bregan D'aerthe''' ({{Pronounce|BRAY|gan|_|DAIRTH|refs=}}) was an elite [[drow]] mercenary and later mercantile group founded and led by [[Jarlaxle]], primarily based in [[Menzoberranzan]] in the [[Underdark]].",
        "Activities": "Bregan D'aerthe was primarily a mercenary and mercantile band. Members, both individuals and the band as a whole, were available for hire to the highest bidder. Bregan D'aerthe was involved in most conflicts in Menzoberranzan in one way or another. For example, they traded [[Netherese]] artifacts to Menzoberranzan via Luskan.\n\nBregan D'aerthe was also an information broker, willing to provide information for both sides of a conflict—for the right price. Its contacts reached even as far as the [[svirfneblin]] city of [[Blingdenstone]].\n\nBregan D'aerthe had a reputation that normally allowed its agents to skip lines. Its members were given \"credit\" — often they didn't need to pay because of the threat of retaliation from Bregan D'aerthe.",
        "Base of Operations": "Bregan D'aerthe's main headquarters were hidden in the [[Clawrift]] in Menzoberranzan. However, they had a number of smaller headquarters and hide-outs in many locations throughout Menzoberranan and Ched Nasad.\n\nThe band established a presence on the surface in order to further the band's influence as well as trade for Menzoberranzan. In [[1366 DR]], it briefly had a surface base in [[Calimport]]. \n\nBy [[1377 DR]], Bregan D'aerthe had developed a significant surface presence in [[Luskan]] and used [[Ship Kurth]] as its outward face. Bregan D'aerthe headquarters in Luskan were underground in [[Illusk]]. There was a path that connected the base to [[Closeguard Isle]] and [[Ship Kurth]]. Jarlaxle had a private room in this base.\n[[File:Bregan_d'aerthe-5e.jpg|thumb|''Bregan D'aerthe in the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]].'']]",
        "Possessions": "Members of Bregan D'aerthe carried an insignia of the band that was widely recognized throughout the Underdark, including in [[Sschindylryn]]. Unlike a house insignia, the Bregan D'aerthe insignia did not always allow its bearer to levitate, however (although in [[1484 DR]], [[Braelin Janquay]] was able to use his insignia to do so).\n\nValas Hune had an upside-down cameo trinket of deep green jade that allowed him to send messages to his band when he touched it. Whether this trinket was the same as his insignia was unclear.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the organization had acquired the [[Lantan]]ese [[submarine]] ''[[Scarlet Marpenoth]]'', which was employed as a secret base for Jarlaxle.",
        "Relationships": "Bregan D'aerthe enjoyed relative freedom from the Ruling Council, mostly because of its close relationship with [[House Baenre]] (into which Jarlaxle had in fact been born). The relationship began with Matron [[Yvonnel Baenre]] but continued with her successors, [[Triel Baenre|Triel]] and later [[Quenthel Baenre]].\n\nIn the late fifteenth century DR, Bregan D'aerthe became concerned about the expansion of the [[Jaezred Chaulssin]], viewing them as religious zealots and fearing that the group would draw away potential Bregan D'aerthe recruits. \n\nAmong the houses of Menzoberranzan, Bregan D'aerthe was concerned about the fast growth of [[House Hunzrin]], led by Matron [[Shakti Hunzrin]]. Although Jarlaxle was able to have a firm grip on most mercantile operations in the city, he failed to be able to reign in the growth of the Hunzrin's mercantile empire.",
        "History": {
            "Founding": "Bregan D'aerthe was founded by the houseless rogue Jarlaxle, choosing to separate from the matriarchal drow society. It was built of mainly rogue drow males from destroyed houses of Menzoberranzan and [[Ched Nasad]]. It was widely employed by the ruling houses of Menzoberranzan, especially by [[House Baenre]], which had the resources to hire the group regularly, particularly given that Jarlaxle himself was a Baenre.\n\nThe group soon had an important role on major events at Menzoberranzan; for instance, it was hired by [[House Do'Urden]] to assist on the attack on the fifth house, [[House Hun'ett]], and it played a significant role in the demise of [[House Do'Urden]].",
            "10{{th}} century DR": "Jarlaxle begins the organization slowly having [[Arathis Hune]] as his first Lieutenant.",
            "12{{th}} Century DR": "In [[1118 DR]] Year of the False Bargain, Jarlaxle celebrated 15 decades of Bregan D'aerthe but particularly the previous 100 years of growth. Conflicts and jealousy ensued as did attention to one of the affiliates of the band [[Zaknafein Do'Urden]]. In order to keep internal tensions down Jarlaxle enlisted a young [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]] a position in the band as a second lieutenant.  Conspiracy within the organization and from without by [[House Barrison Del'Armgo]] tests Jarlaxle's leadership and results in the death of [[Arathis Hune]] who had performed vital services of the organization.",
            "14{{th}} century DR": "In [[1358 DR]], Bregan D'aerthe played a role in the drow attack on [[Mithral Hall]]. After the battle was over, the [[illithid]] advisor to Matron [[Yvonnel Baenre]], [[Methil El-Viddenvelp]], was believed dead. However, in truth he had been badly injured but was rescued by Bregan D'aerthe and brought back to the tunnels outside of the city, where he remained for more than a century, advising the band and serving as an object of study for [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]], a [[psion]] and one of the band's leaders.\n\nCirca [[1360 DR]], [[House Xorlarrin]] hired Bregan D'aerthe to help protect the [[Lustrum]] mines.\n\nIn [[1366 DR]], Bregan D'aerthe briefly expanded to a surface base in [[Calimport]], in part due to the influence of [[Crenshinibon]] on Jarlaxle. The [[human]] [[Artemis Entreri]] helped the group make contacts in Calimport. By [[1377 DR]], Bregan D'aerthe had developed a significant surface presence in [[Luskan]] and used [[Ship Kurth]] as its outward face.\n\nDuring Jarlaxle and Artemis Entreri's exploits in the [[Bloodstone Lands]] (around [[1368 DR]]), Kimmuriel increasingly took more command of Bregan D'aerthe while its main leader was gone.\n\nIn [[1369 DR]], Bregan D'aerthe acted in [[Ust Natha]] in connection with [[House Jae'llat]] and [[Deirex]] the [[lich]].\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Menzoberranzan]] ([[1372]]-[[1373 DR]]), Bregan D'aerthe provided intelligence on the siege for city leaders. Jarlaxle, however, was not in the city at the time. Meanwhile, Bregan D'aerthe agent [[Valas Hune]] was investigating the [[Silence of Lolth]], having been hired by [[Matron Mother]] [[Triel Baenre]] to escort [[Quenthel Baenre]]'s expedition through the Underdark.\n\nIn [[1376 DR|1376]]-[[1377 DR]] Bregan D'aerthe played a role in the fall of the Host Tower of the Arcane in Luskan and the subsequent grapple for dominance between Captain [[Deudermont]], who was supported by [[Waterdhavian]] nobles and the [[High Captains (Luskan)|High Captains]]. They secured trade relations with Luskan during this incident, aligning with [[Ship Kurth]]. Jarlaxle later used that connection to make a deal with [[Marchion]] [[Elastul Raurym]], opening trade with the city of [[Mirabar]].",
            "15{{th}} century DR": "[[File:Bregan D'Aerthe Spy.jpg|thumb|200px|''A 15{{th}} century Bregan D'aerthe spy in [[Neverwinter]].'']]\nIn [[1466 DR]], Bregan D'aerthe, at the bequest of Jarlaxle, assaulted [[Draygo Quick]]'s compound in [[Gloomwrought]] in the [[Shadowfell]] to free his prisoners: [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and the petrified [[Dahlia Sin'felle]] and [[Artemis Entreri]]. In [[1469 DR]], Draygo Quick was continuing to work with Bregan D'aerthe; [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]] had agreed to share information he gathered from working with the [[illithids]] in return for forgiveness for the assault on Quick's home.\n\nBregan D'aerthe had made strong headway in Luskan. By [[1483 DR]], the drow agent [[Beniago]], disguised as a [[human]], was [[High Captain]] [[Kurth]]. Bregan D'aerthe also had its eyes set on the city of [[Neverwinter]]. It retained a number of agents in the city in order to maintain an understanding of the forces at play and pounce on an opportunity for profit, should it arise.\n\nIn [[1484 DR]], Bregan D'aerthe was hired by Matron Mother Quenthel Baenre to clean up [[House Do'Urden]] in Menzoberranzan, as well as to make up the garrison for that house. For a brief time, two-thirds of the members of Bregan D'aerthe were serving in the garrison, until Jarlaxle began swapping them out and sending them back to Luskan. Jarlaxle was assigned the title of Captain of the Guard, although he bribed [[Gromph Baenre]] with [[psionic]]s lessons from Kimmuriel to get out of his duties and escape the city."

        "Members": {
            "Leadership": "After the debacle with Crenshinibon in [[1366 DR]], Jarlaxle left the organization in the capable hands of his trusted lieutenant [[Kimmuriel Oblodra]] and adventured on the surface with [[Artemis Entreri]]. Kimmuriel longed for a time when he could return to his lieutenant status and let Jarlaxle take over again, allowing him to return to his personal [[psionics|psionic]] studies.\n\nSome time after his adventures in the [[Bloodstone Lands]], Jarlaxle returned and resumed his throne as leader of Bregan D'aerthe, still working in the shadows of society to establish trade and profits from the surface world, particularly in Luskan. and indeed Jarlaxle undertook missions for Kimmuriel and paid him for the services of Bregan D'aerthe when he wished to use the band for personal missions. However, by [[1484 DR]], with Kimmuriel away at an illithids' hive, Jarlaxle was once again seen as an equal co-leader with Kimmuriel.\n\nAfter the expansion of Bregan D'aerthe, it was broken up into a number of cells led by lieutenants of equal standing, each of whom was given jurisdiction over an area of interest for the group. The cells were, for the most part, independent, although they still gave allegiance to Jarlaxle and Kimmuriel. For example, [[Beniago]] was the lieutenant largely responsible for Luskan.",
