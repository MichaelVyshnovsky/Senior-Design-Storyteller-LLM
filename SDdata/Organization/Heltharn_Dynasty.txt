Filur, Impiltur
The Heltharn Dynasty was the fourth of the ruling dynasties of Impiltur.
House Heltharn was the family of paladin war-captain Imphras Heltharn the Great, who united what were four independent cities against a hobgoblin horde in 1095 DR. After his victory the second realm of Impiltur was formed.
The dynasty included many paladins as kings and its queens were sorceresses or wizardesses. It included six kings, one queen, two regents, and five others who never ruled but were marked for succession.
Its last king was Imbrar II, who died without an heir in the Year of Blue Fire, 1385 DR.
