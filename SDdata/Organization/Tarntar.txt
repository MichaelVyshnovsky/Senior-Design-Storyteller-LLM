The '''Tarntar''' were a group of wealthy [[wizard]]s and merchants from [[Sembia]] that formed an illicit trading association that dabbled in slavery, smuggling, warehouse heists, and kidnapping of noble Sembian children and youths. It is unknown when this highly secretive cabal was formed, but it was known to be operating during the 1360s [[DR]] at least.{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks archive|34}}{{Cite web/Elminster Speaks/Part 29: The Battle at the Bar}}
