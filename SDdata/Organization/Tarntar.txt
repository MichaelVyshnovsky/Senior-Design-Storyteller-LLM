The Tarntar were a group of wealthy wizards and merchants from Sembia that formed an illicit trading association that dabbled in slavery, smuggling, warehouse heists, and kidnapping of noble Sembian children and youths. It is unknown when this highly secretive cabal was formed, but it was known to be operating during the 1360s DR at least.
Some prominent members of the Tarntar and their entourage happened to be staying in Voonlars Whistling Wizard inn when the Battle at the Bar broke out in the common room of the establishment. At least three members of the Tarntar lost their lives in the conflict.
