The '''Vigilent Order''' was a loosely organized society in [[Waterdeep]] dedicated to furthering the ends of the [[evil]] [[deity|god]] [[Asmodeus]].  In the years prior to [[1480 DR]], the Vigilent Order was nearly destroyed by the [[Deva (aasimar)|deva]] [[Jinnaoth Ir'Gadohn]] who ruthlessly hunted down members of the Order.  Until the late 15th century DR, most members of the Order were poor, desperate people who hoped to improve their situation through Asmodeus' power.  The Order began recruiting members of Waterdeep's nobility who wanted more wealth and power.  The Order was one of the groups attempting to complete the ritual of the [[First Flensing]] which would have created a gateway for Asmodeus to the [[Prime Material Plane]].
