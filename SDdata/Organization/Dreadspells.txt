The '''Dreadspells''' were a short-lived group of [[Shar]]ran priests empowered by the capture of an [[avatar]] of [[Mystra]] in the midâ€“8{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Activities==
The charter of the Dreadspells was to fetch [[enchanted]] objects and destroy the [[Chosen of Mystra]].

==Tactics==
The Dreadspells had the ability to employ [[arcane]] spells thanks to a rite, but conspicuously did not adapt their tactics accordingly.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|697-698|17}}

==Base of Operations==
They operated, however briefly, out of the [[House of Holy Night]].

==Relationships==
Their leader, [[Elryn]], served under the command of the Dark Lady [[Avroana]].

==History==
In the {{yearlinkName|767}}, the Sharrans at the House of Holy Night developed a rite through which they could use a captive aspect of [[Mystra]], the sorceress-queen [[Dasumia]],{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|680-681|15}} to cast the spells of wizards. The newly formed group of priests that would employ such arcane magic was dubbed the Dreadspells, and they were soon sent after [[Elminster Aumar]], a [[Chosen of Mystra]], who had been spotted near [[Westgate]].

The Dreadspells tracked Elminster to a ruin, fighting the [[elven]] [[mage]] [[Ilbryn Starym]] along the way with only one casualty.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|705-713|19}} They tried to use it to slay Elminster, but failed due to the intervention of the god [[Azuth]] and the undead [[Netherese]] sorceress [[Saeraede Lyonora]].{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|730-731|19}} The group was completely slain soon after by the successive efforts of [[Klalaera]], an enforcer of Shar come to herd them back into the fray after they fled Azuth, then the mages [[Umbregard]] and [[Starsunder]], who attacked them while they were being pushed back towards Azuth, and finally the archmage [[Tenthar Taerhamoos]], who finished them off.{{cite book/Elminster Ascending/The Temptation of Elminster|741-745|20}}
