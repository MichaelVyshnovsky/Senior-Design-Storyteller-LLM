        "mainbody": "'''The Nine''' was a powerful, long-lasting band of adventurers that wandered the [[Forgotten Realms|Realms]] for over thirty winters, formerly led by [[Laeral Silverhand]].",
        "History": {
            "Circa 1300-1330 DR": "The band maintained a subterranean stronghold, the [[Stronghold of the Nine]], in the [[High Forest]], on the banks of the [[Unicorn Run]]. Before they disbanded, they had links to the [[Harpers]] and the [[Lords of Waterdeep]].\n\nThe fortress used to be a [[dwarven]] outpost, but under contract, the dwarves expanded it closer to the Unicorn Run under contract for the adventurers.{{Cite web/Candlekeep Forum/The Hooded One (2013)/05-27 - Stronghold of the Nine}}",
            "Crown of Horns": "In the {{YearlinkName|1337}}, the Nine acquired the ''[[Crown of Horns]]'' from a crypt underneath [[YÃ»lash]]. When [[Laeral Silverhand]], the leader of the group, donned the headpiece, she descended into madness and the band fragmented into three warring parties.\n\nBy {{Yearlink|1358}}, four of the Nine had died; only \"Laeral\", a [[wizard]], a [[thief]], a [[warrior]], and a [[priest]] remained alive and still ensconced in the stronghold. The \"Laeral\" in that stronghold was visited briefly by [[Amelior Amanitas]], who became imprisoned while looking for a ''[[potion of stone to flesh]]'', sometime between [[Marpenoth 1]] and [[Nightal 1]]. Unknown to him, that was a ''[[simulacrum]]'' left behind by Laeral,{{Cite dragon/181/Pages from the Mages|16}} who had been rescued by [[Khelben Arunsun]]; while it was publicly believed that he'd rescued her around {{Yearlink|1357}}, she had been in his tower by {{Yearlink|1355}} already, up and active after a long recovery from madness and from a battle of spells with Khelben that left malingering sequels in the [[High Forest]].",
            "After Laeral's Rescue": "Laeral only kept regular contact with two members of the Nine after her enslavement and subsequent rescue from the ''Crown'': [[Thanadar]] of [[Dragonrock]] and [[Arnthiir Windrivv]]. The two of them were forced to change their names due to a magical curse that allowed any knowing [[hordling]]s to teleport themselves to the location of any of the Nine simply by speaking their names.\n\nThe stronghold was largely uninhabited a decade later; it was reasonable to expect a ''[[portal|gate]]'' to [[Blackstaff Tower]]. Shortly after, it was reclaimed by a band of elven adventurers who claimed the same name, apparently with the previous leader's blessing.",
            "1479 DR": "Most nobles of [[Cormyr]] had heard rumors that some of the Nine still existed in the post-[[Spellplague]] world, trapped in magic items, and could be summoned forth from those items by those who hold them - and know how to activate them - to fight as the item-bearers' slaves. By [[1479 DR]], only two of these entrapped spirits, known as [[Blueflame ghost]]s, had been discovered: [[Treth Halonter]] and [[Relve Langral]], trapped in the ''[[Wyverntongue Chalice]]'' and ''[[Flying Blade]]'' respectively.\n\n[[Manshoon]] claimed to know of the existence of six - maybe seven - items containing souls of the Nine."
        },
        "Known Members": "* [[Laeral Silverhand]] was the leader.\n* [[Thanadar]] of [[Dragonrock]] was one of the survivors, a ranger;\n* [[Arnthiir Windrivv]] was another such survivor, a bard.\n* [[Treth Halonter]] was a warrior who almost certainly perished before the Crown was destroyed,\n* [[Relve Langral]] was another survivor, a rogue, who also most certainly perished before the Crown's destruction.\n* 4 other members, a [[fighter]], a [[rogue]], a [[wizard]] and a [[cleric]], left unnamed, had endured to {{yearlink|1358}}, but only two survived past Laeral's rescue."
