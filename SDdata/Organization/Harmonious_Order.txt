The '''Harmonious Order''' was a group of personable [[cleric]]s and [[paladin]]s of [[Milil]], who traveled [[Faer√ªn]] accomplishing great feats worthy of being shared by poets and story-tellers. They often were egoistical and overly sure of themselves.

==Activities==
To ensure their exploits would be immortalized by song or story, members of the order would encourage [[bard]]s, [[tuneservant]]s and troubadours to accompany them on their romantic and glorious quests.{{Cite web enhancement/Deity Do's and Don'ts|8}}

Beyond their adventures, the official duties of the Harmonious Order were to guard the ''Lord of Song's'' holy sites and perform benevolent deeds for the people in his name.

==History==
This order of priests and knights was fairly old. Many famous bards' tales, however exaggerated in their re-telling, owe their origins to deeds performed by these devout priests and champions of Milil.

==Members==
Paladins of the Harmonious Order were called ''Harmonious Knights''.{{Cite web enhancement/Benefits of Membership}} They were granted special powers by their deity, such as the ability to use [[song]]s to inspire their allies.

In addition to clerics and paladins, the order also included some [[fighter]]s and [[bard]]s.{{Cite web enhancement/The Leaves of Learning|12}}
