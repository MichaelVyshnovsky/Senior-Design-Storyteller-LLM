The Harmonious Order was a group of personable clerics and paladins of Milil, who traveled Faer√ªn accomplishing great feats worthy of being shared by poets and story-tellers. They often were egoistical and overly sure of themselves.
To ensure their exploits would be immortalized by song or story, members of the order would encourage bards, tuneservants and troubadours to accompany them on their romantic and glorious quests.
Beyond their adventures, the official duties of the Harmonious Order were to guard the Lord of Songs holy sites and perform benevolent deeds for the people in his name.
This order of priests and knights was fairly old. Many famous bards tales, however exaggerated in their re-telling, owe their origins to deeds performed by these devout priests and champions of Milil.
Paladins of the Harmonious Order were called Harmonious Knights. They were granted special powers by their deity, such as the ability to use songs to inspire their allies.
In addition to clerics and paladins, the order also included some fighters and bards.
