The '''Matsutomo''' clan were a [[samurai]] family in [[Wa]] and the leaders of [[Aru Province]] on and off through the 1600s and 1700s on the [[Wa Calendar]].

==History==
In {{YearlinkConvert|1608|WY}}, the shogun [[Eiko]] officially recognized the settlement of [[Aru]] and decreed it the capital of the new Aru Province. Choosing the completely loyal Matsutomo clan to lead it, he appointed the clan head Arata Matsutomo as its first [[daimyo]]; the Matsutomos dutifully relocated to Aru. Arata served ably for two decades, until {{YearlinkConvert|1627|WY}}, when bandits aided by unidentified supernatural creatures ([[tengu]] being one possibility) massacred a large [[pilgrim]] train in one of the mountain passes. The shogun reprimanded Arata for this failure of security. The [[1210 DR|next year]], Arata's samurai guarded the next pilgrim train, but they too were attacked and slaughtered to a man. The shogun removed Arata and the Matsutomos from power, passing the province to the [[Toda]] clan.

The shogun returned Aru to the Matsutomo clan in {{YearlinkConvert|1640|WY}}, now under Koji Matsutomo. A weak man, Koji was liked by peasants but hated by rival nobles who'd moved to Aru. He survived two attempted coups in {{YearlinkConvert|1645|WY}} and {{YearlinkConvert|1649|WY}}, and thereafter focused only on protecting himself and his clan. As a result, he neglected the province's administration and corruption got out of control. When in {{YearlinkConvert|1652|WY}} the annual shipment of tax payments at [[Uwaji]] was 30% less than reported on the manifest, Koji and the Matsutomos were removed, with the province passed to the [[Kubahachi]] clan.This may be in error: Uwaji was not the capital of Wa at the time, instead, [[Iiso]] was.

The daimyate went back to the Matsutomos in {{YearlinkConvert|1717|WY}}. Vowing to do better, Masakito Matsutomo was efficient and enlightened, if strict, but too old to reign for long. He died in {{YearlinkConvert|1725|WY}} and was succeeded by his son, Hisao. Hisao lacked his father's wisdom and corruption flourished in Aru Province again. Many of his advisors established their own "business interests", most egregiously charging pilgrims a "visitation fee" to worship at the [[Shining Temple of Bishamon]]. When the shogun heard of his violation of tradition, the Matsutomos were removed again in {{YearlinkConvert|1730|WY}}.

In {{YearlinkConvert|1758|WY}}, shogun [[Matasuuri Nagahide]] returned the daimyate once again to the Matsutomos. [[Benju Matsutomo]], a renowned samurai and one of Nagahide's generals, governed well but as he grew older he worried about his family's future. Deciding his ancestors' failures resulted from overambition, he resolved to be as quiet, safe, unobtrusive, and error-free as he could, hoping that if the Matsutomos could hold the daimyate for a few generations, they might achieve a better position. He remained in power through {{YearlinkConvert|1775|WY}}.

==Reputation==
Regularly removed from power for one failure or another, the Matsutomos had a history of bad luck and even shame with regards to the province.

==Home==
When they were in power as daimyos of Aru Province, the Matsutomos lived in its capital, the town of [[Aru]],

==Possessions==
A family heirloom was a [[katana]] of quality make. It had been in the family for ten generations by the time Benju wielded it.
