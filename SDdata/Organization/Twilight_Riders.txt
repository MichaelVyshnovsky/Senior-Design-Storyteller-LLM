The '''Twilight Riders''' were a vigilante organization in [[Damara]] formed in [[1359 DR]]. 

==Organization==
The Riders were a group of heroes gathered by the wizard [[Emelyn the Gray]]. They used seven magical steeds created using the last light of day by the former [[Red Wizard]] [[Myrddin Viligoth]]. They went around south Damara in search of wrongs needing righting and acted as emissaries of King [[Gareth Dragonsbane]], spreading the idea of the new [[Bloodstone Lands|Bloodstone Kingdom]]. The Riders concerned themselves with both little deeds and great exploits. Despite this, all the Riders worked very well together.

==Members==
The members of the group were:
* [[Emelyn the Gray]], the leader and archmage of Damara;
* [[Myrddin Viligoth]], a former [[Red Wizard of Thay]];
* [[Tamal]], the young [[dwarven]] prince of [[Clan Orothiar]]
* [[Gabrielle]], the apprentice of Emelyn
* [[Haelimbrar|Agarelth]], a [[Knight of Imphras II]] of [[Impiltur]] in disguise
* [[Justin M'Dael]], a [[paladin]] friend of Gareth Dragonsbane
* [[Tamarin Moonwisher]], the wife of Justin and a powerful ranger.

==History==
Emelyn, with the help of Myrddin Viligoth, started the Twilight Riders in only 1359 DR. However, in a few weeks, they proved very efficient in helping the common people of Damara in their problems. Emelyn decided to head for the town of [[Tellerth]], hoping to learn more about [[Rawlinswood]]'s druids and [[centaur]]s.
