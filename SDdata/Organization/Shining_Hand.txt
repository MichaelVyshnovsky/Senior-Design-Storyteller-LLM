The '''Shining Hand''' was a [[monastic order]] based in [[Amn]], dedicated to [[Azuth]].

==Activities==
The [[monk]]s of the Shining Hand mixed their monastic practices and their faith in Azuth with the study of [[magic]], such that they could also be [[wizard]]s.

==Possessions==
The [[Vaasa]]n monks of the order made a unique variety of ''[[Robes of the Shining Hand|enchanted robes]]'' that possessed powerful magic.

==History==
The Shining Hand was one of the longest-running monastic orders in Amn.

However, Amn's persecution of wizards and their practices caused many monks of the order to go underground or even to leave the country.

Some of them founded the Shining Hand Monastery in [[Vaasa]] that gained renown and small fortune for creating [[robes of the Shining Hand]] that were in high demand across [[Faer√ªn]] in late 14{{th}} century [[DR]], keeping the monks busy creating variations of the successful design.
