The Shining Hand was a monastic order based in Amn, dedicated to Azuth.
The monks of the Shining Hand mixed their monastic practices and their faith in Azuth with the study of magic, such that they could also be wizards.
The Vaasan monks of the order made a unique variety of enchanted robes that possessed powerful magic.
The Shining Hand was one of the longest-running monastic orders in Amn.
However, Amns persecution of wizards and their practices caused many monks of the order to go underground or even to leave the country.
Some of them founded the Shining Hand Monastery in Vaasa that gained renown and small fortune for creating robes of the Shining Hand that were in high demand across Faer√ªn in late 14 century DR, keeping the monks busy creating variations of the successful design.
