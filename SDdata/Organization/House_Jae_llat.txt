House Jaellat was a drow house located in Ust Natha.
House Jaellat was the founding house of Ust Natha, and the powerful lich Deirex Jaellat was part of their ranks. Their home was located above the male fighters society of Ust Natha. Their residence was filled with gems and could only be entered with a ward stone. It was also heavily guarded by drow fighters with long swords and shields.
The matron mother of House Jaellat once outwitted Jarlaxle and humiliated him, a rare happening. Jarlaxle may have employed Gorions Ward to steal gems from the founder, Deirex, and may have killed him.
