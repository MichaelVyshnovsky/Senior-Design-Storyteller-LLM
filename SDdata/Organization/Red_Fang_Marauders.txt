The '''Red Fang Marauders''', or simply the '''Red Fang''', was a [[goblin]] and [[goblinoid]] tribe of marauding bandits, secretly allied with the [[Zhentarim]], that menaced the [[Western Heartlands]] in the late 14{{th}} century [[DR]].

==History==
[[File:Red Fang Goblin Lair.png|thumb|''The marauders' lair in the Trollbark Forest.'']]
In the late 14{{th}} century DR, the Red Fang Marauders targeted the environs of Baldur's Gate, striking at traveling caravans from a base that was well hidden from the Gate's guards. One of the marauders' lairs was hidden in a cave within the [[Trollbark Forest]] from where they raided the [[Trade Way]]. One of the caravans that fell under the goblinoid attack was [[Randalla Brasshorn]]'s. She had led the caravan from [[Waterdeep]] to Baldur's Gate but it was attacked on the portion of the road south of [[Dragonspear Castle]]. That hideout was led by a goblin chieftain [[Bile-Tooth]] and housed kidnapped caravaners, including Randalla Brasshorn. Another goblin force set out for the [[Wayfork Village]] to pillage and ravage under the leadership of [[hobgoblin]] [[Harnak]] the Butcher.

Serendipitously, a group of adventurers came across [[Keaira]], Randalla's caravan guard, and set out to find the Trollbark caves. Subsequently, they slew Bile-Tooth and freed the captured caravaners. Soon after, they defended Wayfork Village from the Red Fang Marauders and slew Harnak at the [[Wayfork Inn]].
