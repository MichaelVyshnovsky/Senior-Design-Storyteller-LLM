==History==
The Jardeths were of [[Chondathan]] descent and worshiped [[Helm]]. They were ennobled in the {{YearlinkName|1248}}, along with many of their fellow merchant gentry families. As of 1372 DR, there were forty-one living members.

In the {{YearlinkName|1365}}, the Jardeths were part of a flotilla of twelve ships that attempted to establish trade at [[Helmsport]] in Maztica, but the Lord-Governor of [[New Amn]] turned them away, citing limits on transoceanic trade that had been put in place by the [[Council of Six (Amn)|Council of Six]]. The trade armada eventually landed on [[Maztapan Island]] and in the space of two months established the New Waterdeep colony.
