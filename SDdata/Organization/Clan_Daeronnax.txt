==History==
The clan lived around the lava-filled lair of the wyrm Daeronnax and patrolled the tunnels nearby. During the 1480s DR, an ancient [[Netherese tomb (Stonelands)|Netherese tomb]] was discovered by a team of [[adventurer]]s made up of [[Jarus Brithandir]], [[Helayna]], [[Tristran of Daggerford]], [[Kirina Aelorothi]], [[Liantor Stoneborn]], and [[Popkin Shortshanks]]. They passed through the upper levels and blundered into the lower sections controlled by Clan Daeronnax. The party was overcome by an ambush that isolated and scattered them, with only Popkin escaping the caves entirely. The other remained lost in the underground, with Liantor killed and Tristran captured and delivered as a prize to their draconic master. The reinforcements that Popkin brought to bear may have saved the adventurers and slain the dragon, potentially destroying the clan as well.
