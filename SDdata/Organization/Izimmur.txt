The Izimmur family was one of the twenty influential families that made up the Onsruur (the hereditary council of lords) in Khôltar, south Faerûn, circa the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.
The Izimmurs tended to be short and thin, with black hair and eyes so dark they could also be called black. They never forgot a slight, but did not usually resort to physical violence against those that wronged them, choosing to poison them instead. This family kept as much of their activities as secret as possible, and spied on others to learn their secrets.
This family researched various crafters, and those that they invested in were chosen with care. All businesses in which they had a stake were spied upon to monitor progress and constantly exhorted to increase profits. They were quite proud of their stable of crafters and businesses, thinking of them as their prized possessions or pets.
