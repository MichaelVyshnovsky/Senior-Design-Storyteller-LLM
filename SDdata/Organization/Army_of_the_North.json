        "mainbody": "The '''Army of the North''' was a military that comprised soldiers, [[mage]]s, and other combatants of numerous races, drawn from several tribes, nations, and city-states from all across [[the North]] of [[Faerûn]]. They banded together to face the growing threat posed by the [[phaerimm]], after their release from the [[Sharn Wall]] in late [[1371 DR]].\n\n{{Quote|Give your prince the compliments of Laeral Silverhand and tell him the Army of the North has arrived.|Laeral Silverhand, to a [[Shadovar]] warrior.}}",
        "Organization": "The Army of the North was commanded by [[Laeral Silverhand]], chosen of [[Mystra]] and Lady of [[Waterdeep]]. the [[dwarven]] leader [[Skarn Brassaxe]],",
        "Members": "Some of the fiercest and most renowned fighting forces from across the [[Sword Coast North]], the [[Silver Marches]] and beyond joined cause to defend their lands from the highly destructive phaerimm. The allied forces included volunteer soldiers from [[Waterdeep]], members of the [[Knights in Silver]] from [[Silverymoon]], [[Slugsmashers]] from [[Citadel Adbar]], [[Sundabar]]an mercenaries [[Bloodaxe Mercenary Company|Bloodaxe Company]], and [[Vaasan]] warriors from the far-eastern [[Cold Lands]].",
        "History": "The Army of the North began as a small relief force that came together on [[Nightal 30]] of the {{YearlinkName|1371}}. Some twenty Waterdhavian warriors and [[wizard]]s Joined Laeral on a dangerous mission to [[Rocnest]] to help her fellow chosen [[Khelben Arunsun]] and the [[elven high mage]]s within. After teleporting to the ruined elven outpost, the group managed to kill a few phaerimm but were pushed back to the [[Marsh of Chelimber]]. It was there that Laeral made first contact with the [[Princes of Shade]].\n\nBy [[Mirtul]] of the {{YearlinkName|1372}}, the Army of the North had grown to its full strength. The army remained mired in downpour rain within the [[High Moor]], poised to face the phaerimm in the greatest conflict either side had seen in over four months of fighting.\n\nThe Army of the North fought their next engagement against the phaerimm army, forces composed of [[bugbear]]s, [[mind flayer]]s, and [[beholder]]s, on [[Mirtul 15]] while crossing the [[Winding Water]]. With [[Boareskyr Bridge]] flooded due to unusual downpours, the Army of the North resorted to fighting in unfavorable conditions. As Uthgardt warriors and other soldiers crossed the waters atop rafts, [[hippogriff]] riders, war wizards and other aerial combatants fended off the incoming phaerimm and their minions. The fighting was long and arduous but the Army of the North emerged victorious. The Shadovar were notably absent from the engagement however, having withdrawn from their alliance following a disastrous council with the Lords of Waterdeep and other regional leaders.\n\nBy the [[Mirtul 19|19{{th}}]] of the month, the full force of the army had reached the [[Forest of Wyrms]]. Tired of an endless march that led to excessive casualties, Laeral had her mages translocate the entirety of their forces from the forest way to the [[Greycloak Hills]]. They appeared just beyond the [[shadowshell]], They accomplished this magnificent feat of in a matter of hours, by means of expertly timed marches into a well-placed ''[[teleportation circle]]''. The Army of the North was perfectly positioned to finally relieve the beleaguered Evereskan defenders, and managed to slay 20 or so phaerimm in a few days time.\n\nThis maneuver surprised both the army's Shadovar allies along with the phaerimm themselves; the latter of whom believed the Army of the North still remained over {{SI|200|mi|k}} to the southwest."
