The '''Seven Suns Trading Coster''' was a merchant organization operating in the [[Western Heartlands|Western]] and [[Eastern Heartlands]] of [[Faerûn]] during the 14{{th}} and 15{{th}} centuries [[DR]]. The name of the coster was in reference to the great distances that separated each of its merchant members. .

The Seven Suns' symbol, used on banners and trailglyphs, was seven spaced circles arranged in the shape of a stick figure, laid on its side with head to the right.

==Organization==
The leading partners of the Seven Suns were [[Alvund]], [[Chond]], [[Dzunn]], [[Nammna]], [[Jhasso]], [[Pomphur]], and [[Shield (person)|Shield]].[[Cormyr (sourcebook)|''Cormyr'']], page 46, says the Bleths "control one of the largest merchant companies in Cormyr: the Seven Suns trading company". It is unclear if the Bleths control the entire Seven Suns Trading Coster, or if only they command its activities in Cormyr, with Gruen Bleth as an 'eighth partner' in the coster alliance.

The coster had regional bases located in cities across Faerûn, such as Baldur's Gate on the [[Sword Coast]], managed by Jhasso, and Suzail in Cormyr, managed by Gruen Bleth. Each of the partners provided wagons, [[horse]]s, and draft oxen to the coster, and hired local guards.

==Activities==
The Seven Suns was a trading [[coster]], The Seven Suns was one of the poorer quality costers around, with weak locally hired guards and shabby wagons. As a consequence, its caravans were slow and often targeted by bandits. But it was also the least expensive, undercutting their competitors on almost every trade-route.{{Cite web/Caravans of the Western Heartlands}}{{Cite web/Caravans and Trading Companies in Sembia}} 

They operated throughout the Western Heartlands, Cormyr and [[Sembia]].

==History==
The coster was formed by seven partners of widely separated origins: [[Jhasso]] of [[Baldur's Gate]], [[Shield (merchant)|Shield]] of [[Everlund]], [[Pomphur]] of [[Almraiven]], [[Chond]] of [[Calaunt]], [[Alvund]] of [[Ormpetarr]], [[Dzunn]] of [[Sheirtalar]], and [[Nammna]] of [[Milvarune]]. The "Seven Suns" referred to the seven merchants themselves. Each had their own small companies, but converted these into regional bases for the coster. The Seven Suns were in business by [[1358 DR]]. 

They were still going strong as of the {{YearlinkName|1367}}. 

In the late 1360s, the head of the Cormyrean Seven Suns attended a celebration held by Lord [[Partic Thistle]] at his manor, [[Thistleflame Keep]], in honor of [[Azoun IV|King Azoun IV]]'s birthday, in addition to Lord [[Gruen Bleth]].

In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the Seven Suns headquarters in Baldur's Gate was infiltrated and taken over by [[doppelganger]]s, working on behalf of the rival [[Iron Throne]]. One assumed the identity of [[Jhasso]] and kept him captive in the basement. The doppelgangers then proceeded to make poor business decisions that drove the coster toward bankruptcy. This affected the economy of the whole city and attracted the attention of the [[Grand Duke]]s. 

[[Hurbold Duethkatha|Scar]], the commander of Baldur's Gate's [[Flaming Fist]] mercenary guards, asked [[Abdel Adrian]] to investigate strange goings-on at the Seven Suns headquarters in Baldur's Gate. He and his adventuring companions eliminated the doppelganger threat and rescued the merchant Jhasso.

The Seven Suns were still operating as of the {{YearlinkName|1374}}.

By the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Baldurian Seven Suns were struggling to stay afloat. As of then, that branch of the coster had come under the control of the [[Jhasso (family)|Jhasso]] [[Nobility of Baldur's Gate|patriar family]].
