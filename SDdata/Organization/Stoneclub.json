        "Organization": "The Stoneclubs' tactics were notably more cunning and intelligent than was usually expected of a marauding band of ogres. This was thanks to their leader, an [[ogre mage]] who was presumed to be a member of the [[Kur-Tharsu]].",
        "Base of Operations": "The tribe resided in an abandoned [[Thentia]]n guard tower north of the [[Moonsea (lake)|Moonsea]] coast. From there, they struck at passing caravans traveling the [[Sword Trail]] connecting Thentia to [[Melvaunt]] to capture prisoners and goods.{{Cite dungeon/177/Realmslore: Vaasa|81}}",
        "History": "In the late 14{{th}} century, the band sacked a caravan owned by the [[Double Moon Coster]], capturing several merchants. The Coster promptly hired adventurers to save the captives and to exact revenge on the Stoneclubs."
