        "mainbody": "The Circle of Leth was one of the most powerful druidic hierarchies of Faer√ªn. They were the followers of the Nentyarch, and governed both the Forest of Lethyr and much of the surrounding lands in the Great Dale.\nThe Circle of Leth was made up of three rings. Five high druids made up the first ring, standing just below the Nentyarch they were the Nentyarchs advisors and the mentors to all below them. Nine druid masters made up the second ring, which searched out threats to the territory in their ward, commanding the Nentyar hunters in times of war. The third ring was made up of the Circles initiates, low-ranking druids and novices serving amongst the Nentyar hunters or apprenticing to members of the first two rings.\nThe Circle of Leth protected the woods and lands under their care from wanton cutting and oversettlement, People from Thesk knew better than to enter the Forest of Lethyr, considering it to be under the protection of the Circle of Leth.\nFollowing the fall of Narfell, the Circle of Leth took up the task of healing Dun-Tharos and the Rawlinswood. After the Rotting Man took control at Dun-Tharos, the Circle of Leth stopped fighting against the loggers from Damara and Impiltur in the Rawlinswood. In the , the Circle of Leth was working with local treants around Fortress Narder to resettle healthy trees and then wipe clean the blighted land around the fortress. They also guarded the Mucklestones.\nAdditionally, the Circle of Leth was the most important of the informal powers in the Great Dale, acting as its only unifying force in times of war, and preventing them from being at each others throats in times of peace. In this position, they were central to fighting off the Rotting Mans forces.\nThe Nentyarch ruled from his seat at Dun-Tharos until , when the Rotting Man successfully displaced them, forcing the circle to relocate to the Forest of Lethyr.\nThe druids of Leth were the only ones guarding the secret of the power of the stone markers at Bezentil.\nThe Circle of Leth had often clashed with the king of Damara over logging rights. Nentyar hunters carried out the commands of the Circle.\nIn the , the Great Druid of Leth took up the title of Nentyarch, and raised a new druidic castle, The Close, atop the overgrown ruins at Dun-Tharos.\nIn the , the Rotting Man came to the Rawlinswood for the first time. In the , servants of the Shadowmasters attempted to frame the rangers of the Forest of Lethyr for killing Lord Uthrain they were stopped by a band of adventurers. In , a plague spread through the land, driving treants insane. The Rotting Mans army took Dun-Tharos on , expelling the Nentyarch, who regrouped in Yeshelmaar.\n*Nentyarch\n*Briartan"
