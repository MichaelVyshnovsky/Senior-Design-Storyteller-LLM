        "mainbody": "he Bloodriders were a unit of several dozen undead cavalry in the service of Kazgoroth the Beast. They were created directly from living humans, presumably by the clerical magic of Bhaal. \nBloodriders were once human Northmen. However, they were possessed or corrupted by evil forces, related somehow to their committing massacres and subsequent firelit festivities during the Darkwalker War.\nBloodriders had stretched grey skin and glowing red eyes. They were able to drain power and sustenance from those they killed. This power was addictive and the Bloodrider leader Laric became fixated on killing and obtaining the power of others. Some of this power even transferred to their mounts which corrupted them toward evil. The hooves of their horses left trails of fire in their wake.\nThe Bloodriders fought in the Darkwalker War against the Sisters of Synnoria. Several Bloodriders died before or during the Battle of Freemans Down. All the rest, save Laric, were killed by Robyns magic during the siege of Caer Corwell. Laric was later killed by Kamerynn, aided by Robyn, Newt and Genna Moonsinger, during a failed attempt to sacrifice Robyn and absorb her power."
