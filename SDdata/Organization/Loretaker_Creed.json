They advocated a long-term strategy of gathering all forms of information and slowly depleting information held by other races. They did not care about how useful the information was. This strengthened their community while weakening rival communities.<ref name =\"DDGttUpp22,75,80-81\">",
        "Bases": "The Loretakers were unique to the illithid metropolis of [[Oryndoll]].  \n\nIn Oryndoll, the Loretakers had many places throughout lower Oryndoll named [[Scriptoriums (Oryndoll)|Scriptoriums]].<ref name =\"DDGttUpp22,75,80-81\"/>",
        "History": "They were formed in the chaos that erupted in Oryndoll as a result of the [[duergar]] uprisings around {{Yearlink|-4000}}. Oryndoll followed the Loretakers strategy to force other races into barbarism for thousands of years after these events.\n\nBy [[1370 DR]], they were the second-most powerful Creed in the city, following only the [[Venerator Creed]]. The city was nearly united under these two Creeds. They even held influence over their own branch of the military, the [[Minders]]. By this year they had also renewed their assaults on surface lorehouses.<ref name =\"DDGttUpp22,75,80-81\"/>"
