        "Organization": "In the {{YearlinkName|1368}}, the Blue Dragons numbered more than 2,500 trained naval warriors. Fourteen large vessels led the fleet. The flagship and unofficial royal yacht was called the ''[[Crown of Cormyr]]''. It was like a floating palace but was well-equipped with [[ballista]]e and catapults for flinging \"firepots\" ([[alchemist's fire]]) at enemies. The command ship was called the ''[[Dragon (Cormyrian ship)|Dragon]]'' and was the largest warship in the fleet. The mere presence of these ships in the harbor was enough to dissuade [[Westgate]] and the other enemy navies of the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] from attacking Suzail.\n\nThe ships that did most of the work were much smaller and faster coast-runners such as the ''[[Blade of Espar]]'' and the ''[[Lance of Wheloon]]''. These were out almost every day on the waters of the Inner Sea hunting pirates."
