The walled estate of three-story buildings surrounding a garden area had a long frontage on [[Ivory Street]] directly across from the [[Tower of Luck]]. A very short leg of the perimeter overlooked the [[Street of the Singing Dolphin]]. Immediately across Sighing Maiden's Walk was the [[Blue Alley]].\n[[File:Map05-Hiilgauntlet Villa-Tower of Luck.png|thumb|right|270px|''The Hiilgauntlet family villa (labeled 79) ''circa'' [[1357 DR]].'']]",
        "Possessions": "The Hiilgauntlets also technically owned [[Lord Hund's Tomb]] on the [[Arcane Chambers]] level of [[Undermountain]]. Lord Hund had it built to his specifications and then became a [[mummy]] to dwell there and be entertained by bumbling [[adventurer]]s.",
        "Relationships": "There was some bad blood between the Hiilgauntlets and the [[Eltorchul]] family after Lord Hund paid a small fortune to one of the scions of House Eltorchul for the location of a ''[[gate]]'' into Undermountain he and his brothers had discovered. Lord Hund used the gate to safely get workmen and mages down to build a tomb. After completion, Lord Hund put to death the young Eltorchul lord and most of the workers that constructed the tomb, turning them into undead guardians of his new abode. The other Eltorchul brothers retaliated but could not breach the traps and defenders, so they hired [[mage]]s to destroy the ''gate'' to seal Hund in and then ransacked Hund's villa and kidnapped his daughter.\n\nThe Hiilgauntlets were secretly relieved at Lord Hund's disappearance. The stolen daughter eventually fell in love and married one of the Eltorchul brothers and they had children of their own.",
        "History": "The Hiilgauntlets were of [[Illuskan]] descent and the family was ennobled in the wave of elevations of the merchant gentry in the {{YearlinkName|1248}}. As of 1372 DR, there were twenty-one living members and one undead.",
        "Members": "* [[Jhassin Hiilgauntlet]]: Patriarch in the mid–14{{th}} century.\n* [[Salu Hiilgauntlet]]: Consort of Jhassin.\n* [[Jhassin Hiilgauntlet II]]: Eldest son and heir of Jhassin I and Salu.\n* [[Hund Hiilgauntlet]]: Grand-uncle of Jhassin I, a [[necromancer]] who turned himself in to a mummy and moved to Undermountain."
