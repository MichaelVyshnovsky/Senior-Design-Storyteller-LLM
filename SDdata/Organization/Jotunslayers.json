        "mainbody": "'''The Jotunslayers''' were a band of [[dwarf|dwarven]] adventurers in the 14{{th}} century [[DR]] who lived for battle and monster hunts.",
        "Organization": "The Jotunslayers consisted exclusively of dwarves.",
        "Activities": "The members of the Jotunslayers could often be found in taverns, re-telling the awe-inspiring stories of their monster hunts, and developing new tactics and methods of bringing down monstrous prey.\n\nTheir main opponents were [[monstrosity|monstrosities]], [[aberration]]s, and such. They were known to take up their [[axe]]s against [[orc]]s and other hostile [[humanoids]]. Their passion, however, lay in battling strange creatures with tentacles and fearsome dragons.\n\nThe Jotunslayers often sold their services to parties interested in cleansing an area of nasty monster infestations and they offered escort through treacherous territories. As a rule of thumb, they declined guard services or ventures into the [[Underdark]] as they were too busy with other tasks. The common clients of the Jotunslayers were nobles, guilds, merchants, and other people and companies flush with coin.",
        "Tactics": "The Jotunslayers were armed with axes, their favorite weapons. They also utilized more cunning tools in their hunts, such as bags of marbles, [[caltrop]]s, tripwires, [[acid]] grenades, and others. They commonly wore [[baldric]]s and [[leather]] ''[[clothing of many pouches|jerkins of many pockets]]'', strapped overtop of their [[leather armor]]. Needless to say, they arrived prepared for battle in any scenario.",
        "History": "The Jotunslayers made a name for themselves, literally, after one of their early exploits—ridding the land of numerous [[hill giant]]s and [[fomorian]]s in [[Everlund]] in the {{YearlinkName|1346}}. These dwarven adventurers harbored no special hatred towards the [[giant-kin]] however. Many new members of the Jotunslayers were the family and kin of established members. Most members of this ragtag group were dwarven outcasts and wanderers from various clans. The founding members were four female dwarf [[fighter]]s and two male dwarf [[cleric]]s of [[Marthammor Duin]]. By the late 15{{th}} century DR, only two of the founders were still alive and active: a fighter named [[Shandrannon Ironshield]] and a cleric called [[Bruckhlar Deepdelve|Bruckhlar \"Buckhard\" Deepdelve]]."
