'''Tiiraklar''' was a noble house of [[Tethyr]] that held the realm's throne. It was the fourth of the [[Shoon Traitorum]] vassals of the [[Shoon Imperium]].

==History==
The family came to the throne by the marriage of the ruling Queen [[Vajra Korrunhel]] with [[Karazir Tiiraklar]], leading to the rules of two kings. Another marriage later led to the crown passing to the [[Tornamn Dynasty]].
