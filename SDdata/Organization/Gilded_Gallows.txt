The '''Gilded Gallows''' was a ruthless [[thieves' guild]] operating in the [[Western Heartlands]] and the [[Sword Coast]] as of the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].

==Base of Operations==
The guild was formed and based in [[Elturgard]]. 

==History==
As of the late 15{{th}} century DR, the Gilded Gallows was prospering and its influence was extending along the Sword Coast, with operatives as far north as [[Neverwinter]]. Its symbol&mdash;a gold noose&mdash;had become instantly recognizable among criminals in the region. 

By the {{YearlinkName|1481}},{{Stormwreck-time}} rumors had surfaced that a high-ranking member had betrayed the guild to steal a large sum of [[money]], and so members of the guild were motivated to track down this traitor and the wealth he had secreted away. In fact, the traitor was [[Tarak]], who had been ordered to kill his own lover and had instead chosen to flee the guild. His lover was ultimately assassinated by another member of the guild, and the story was twisted to accuse Tarak of murder and theft.

==Members==
Guildmembers were known as "Gilders", and included not only [[thieves]] but [[assassin]]s, [[poison]]ers, gamblers, smugglers, and [[goblin]]s. They recruited even very young children into their ranks, and trained them in stealth and deception. Some high-ranking members had [[tattoo]]s featuring the guild's golden noose symbol. 

===Notable Members===
* [[Tarak]], who fled the guild and his life of crime to live on [[Stormwreck Isle]].
