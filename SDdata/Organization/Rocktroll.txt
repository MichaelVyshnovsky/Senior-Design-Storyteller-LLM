The Rocktroll tribe was a group made up of orcs and trolls who lived in ancient Netheril.
The tribe was made up of unusually large and ungroomed orcs who were exceptionally tough and prized the ability to frighten their foes. They worked with trolls to make themselves even more fearsome, and for a long time were even ruled by a troll chieftain.
