The House of Helcaliant was the name given to the priesthood of Helcaliantâ€”which was the name of the god Horus-Re in the lands of Thay.
As with all organizations of the Mulhorandi pantheon, positions of power within the priesthood were typically hereditary and most priests were descendants of various incarnations of their god.
