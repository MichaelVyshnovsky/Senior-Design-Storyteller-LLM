        "mainbody": "he Dockers Guild of Baldurs Gate was the organization that represented and self-governed the dockworkers of the Lower City in the late 15 century DR.\nIn the , the Dockers Guild had a standing agreement with the infamous Guild, a criminal origination of Little Calimshan. The chairwoman of the Dockers Guild paid the Guilds thugs to protect cargo that entered and left the harbors of Baldurs Gate via trading vessels. With the rise of the Cult of the Absolute, the newly implemented steel watchers and the Flaming Fist cracked down on smuggling and closely inspected all shipments that moved through the Gates docks. This scrutiny scared off a significant number of traders, reducing commerce, which, in turn, reduced the Dockers Guilds capability to pay the Guild."
