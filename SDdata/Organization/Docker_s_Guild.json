        "mainbody": "The '''Docker's Guild''' of [[Baldur's Gate]] was the organization that represented and self-governed the dockworkers of the [[Lower City]] in the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].",
        "History": "In the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the Docker's Guild had a standing agreement with the infamous [[Guild]], a criminal origination of [[Little Calimshan]]. The chairwoman of the Docker's Guild paid the Guild's thugs to protect cargo that entered and left the harbors of Baldur's Gate via trading vessels. With the rise of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], the newly implemented [[steel watcher]]s and the [[Flaming Fist]] cracked down on smuggling and closely inspected all shipments that moved through the Gate's docks. This scrutiny scared off a significant number of traders, reducing commerce, which, in turn, reduced the Docker's Guild's capability to pay the Guild."
