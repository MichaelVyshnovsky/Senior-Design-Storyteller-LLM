        "History": "During the [[Absolute crisis]] of the {{YearlinkName|1492}}, the newly-risen Kingpin named [[Stone Lord]], started a guild war against the Guild, strategically taking out the Guild's agents, kingpins, and taking over their territory. The Stone Lord was a thrall of the [[Cult of the Absolute]], and as a part of the guild war, his men targeted gangs and smaller organizations under the Guild's rule. Children of Hoar pursued the Stone Lord himself across the city, but were presumed slaughtered by the [[berserker]], leaving behind only bloodied fountain and [[Hoar]]'s ''[[holy symbol]]s'', [[coin]]s, used by the group, bent and discarded in the [[The Steeps]] of the Gate."
