        "mainbody": "The '''Church of Ubtao''' was the organization formed around the worship of [[Ubtao]], the Creator of Chult and the Father of the Dinosaurs. His church consisted mainly of [[jungle druid]]s, [[mazewalker]]s, and [[shaman]]s.",
        "Clergy": {
            "Dogma": "The Church taught its followers that Ubtao was the creator of Chult and the jungles were a test for the faithful, a physical representation of the maze of life through which the Ubtaoans traveled until reaching the afterlife at Ubtao's side. The maze was the focus of the faith, and it represents the life's journey his worshipers took upon. Each Tabaxi child was taught the rudiments of their personal maze, and as the child aged, the maze was expanded with the aid of elders and teachers. Throughout their lives, Ubtaoans drew and redrew their personal mazes, memorizing their unique patterns. Many learned the image well and absentmindedly tranced their shapes in sand or other surfaces in conversations or while idling. After they died, Ubtaoans appeared in front of their deity and were tasked with drawing a maze unique for each individual. Those who succeeded were taken to Ubtao's realm into the afterlife, while those who failed were returned to Chult as wandering [[ghost]]s or ravenous [[ghoul]]s.",
            "Vestments": "Mazewalkers were adorned in [[tobe]]s, light [[robe]]s necessary in Chult's humid climate. They favored ritual body painting in preparation and during religious ceremonies. These intricate maze designs were applied to their faces, around the eyes, and to the wood-carved tabards. Spiritlords exposed more skin wearing nothing but [[loincloth]]s, with rare exemptions wearing decorative overskirts made of animal tails. They wore jewelry made of animal and dinosaur parts and covered their faces with [[ironwood]]-carved masks. Jungle druids preferred mundane clothing of their tribes, decorated with imagery of jungle beats. They could be recognized by small [[ivory]], [[gem]]-carved, [[gold]]en, or [[silver]] [[amulet]]s in the shape of a circular maze – the ''[[holy symbol]]s'' of Ubtao.\n\nAdventuring members of all three sects wore clothes and armor and used weapons common among the Tabaxi tribes of Chult. They carried [[yklwa]] [[spear]]s and [[hardwood]] [[kerrie]] [[club]]s almost never seen outside Chult, while among more common weapons, they used [[handaxe]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[short sword]]s, [[scimitar]]s, [[longbow]]s, and hunting spears. Tanking members of the Church were clad in dinosaur hide [[breastplate]]s, [[helmet]]s of the same material, and [[hlang]] [[shield]]s."

        "Holy Objects": "*''[[Mazewalker chalice]]'', a golden chalice that affected any creature that did not venerate Ubtao. Those who looked at the maze that decorated its surface were driven mad. The effects of the madness were similar to those of the ''[[feeblemind]]'' spell.",
        "Abilities": "Jungle druids were masters of the jungle. They possessed the knowledge and proficiencies needed to survive and thrive in wild Chult. They could navigate thick growth with relative ease, leaving no trails behind. They tended to learn exotic languages of the jungle and swamp inhabitants such as [[aarakocra language|aarakocra]], [[aldani language|aldani]], [[bullywug language|bullywug]], [[dwarven]], [[Goblin language|goblin]], [[lizardfolk language|lizardfolk]], [[locathah language|locathah]], [[muckdweller language|muckdweller]], [[sahuagin language|sahuagin]], [[troglodyte language|troglodyte]], and [[yuan-ti language]]s. Those of higher skill and status gained the ability to ''[[shapechange]]'' into a non-giant [[reptile]], a dinosaur, a bird, or a mammal from the Chultan jungles three times per day.\n\nMazewalkers were almost all exclusively human members of the Tabaxi tribe, despite the fact that there were no religious restrictions from members of other species taking on the role. The reason for this was simple – Tabaxi humans were the most common humanoids in Chult. Those who were accepted into the mazewalkers of Ubtao gained the ability to never get lost in Chult and cast the ''[[analyze balance]]'' spell once per day. As mazewalkers grew in status and experience, they became unaffected by the ''[[maze]]'' spell as well as could not be ''[[confusion|confused]]''. Further down the road, they gained the ability to ''[[mind read]]'', ''[[memory read]]'', and ''[[addition]]'' spells each once per day. The strongest of the mazewalkers could cast ''[[genius]]'' or ''[[fire purge]]''s spells once a day, later – ''[[find the path]]'' or ''[[call dinosaur]]'' spell daily, and lastly, the spell of ''[[mind tracker]]'' daily.\n\nSpiritlords, similarly to mazewalkers, were mostly human Tabaxi. They specialized in brewing quaffs and potions using substances of the Chultan jungle. Each of the spirit lords carved a unique mask they used in the ritual of communication with their spirit adviser. The mask became home to a minor spirit of the dead or of an animal that bonded with a spiritlord. If for any reason, the mask left possession of its owner, it destroyed itself after ten days of separation, allowing the spiritlord to carve a new mask and attach the spirit once again.",
        "Magic": "The clergy of Ubtao were granted several unique spells by their deity. These spells were: ''[[spirit mask]]'', ''[[free will]]'', and ''[[call dinosaurs]]''.",
        "Holy Days and Rituals": "The worshipers of Ubtao had a huge number of rituals, holy days, and customs that venerated the many spirits of the jungle and individual ancestors or celebrated a hunt or life events. These rituals took place around makeshift shrines that were simple rocks and were treated as such outside the ritualistic use.",
        "History": "Worship of Ubtao dated back to the creation of the jungles of [[Chult]]. When he molded the land, Ubtao realized that he had invested too much of his divinity into the essence of the jungles. To remedy the distance created by stretching his being too thin, Ubtao created aspects to be worshiped by the [[human]]s – [[Tabaxi (tribe)|Tabaxi]] [[Chultan (ethnicity)|Chultans]], numerous land and nature spirits, as well as the jungle itself.\n\nUbtao took on the avatar shape of a [[tyrannosaurus]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in the {{YearlinkName|1358}}. After he returned to the planes, Ubtao became more involved in the dealings within his Church and his mortal worshipers. This led to the dramatic expansion of his clergy and worshipers.",
        "Notable Affiliations": "A group of seven unaging champions of Ubtao formed the protector of the faith and the city of Mezro. These men and women were chosen by their deity and were granted lives unaffected by sickness as well as a special gift each. When one of these [[bara]]e perished in battle, a new champion was selected from the worshipers of Ubtao and tasked with venturing to the heart of the [[Temple of Ubtao]] in Mezro. Those who passed the deity's test were ordered to the secrecy of the process, while those who failed were taken to the afterlife.\n\nThe Followers of the Skyserpent, or ''ruk'cho'', was a beast cult that worshiped Ubtao through venerating [[couatl]]s. According to one legend, couatls were the inspiration for Ubtao's creation of dinosaurs.{{Cite dragon/307/Prestige Classes for Cultists of Good Monsters|76}}"
