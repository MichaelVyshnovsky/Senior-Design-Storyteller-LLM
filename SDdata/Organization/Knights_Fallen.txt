The Knights Fallen was a collection of rogues, priests, and warriors who served Ibrandul, the Lord of the Dry Depths.
The group was active within the northern reaches of the Underdark.
The Knights Fallen served Ibrandul by wandering the Underdark, aiding any they stumbled upon who had lost their way in the darkness. The Knights escorted such travelers to safety in exchange for a small fee.
