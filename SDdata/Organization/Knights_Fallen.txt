The '''Knights Fallen''' was a collection of rogues, [[priest]]s, and warriors who served [[Ibrandul]], the Lord of the Dry Depths.

==Base of Operations==
The group was active within the northern reaches of the [[Underdark]].

==Organization==
The Knights Fallen served Ibrandul by wandering the Underdark, aiding any they stumbled upon who had lost their way in the darkness. The Knights escorted such travelers to safety in exchange for a small fee.
