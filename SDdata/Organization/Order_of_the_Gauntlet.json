They were a unified group, bonded by either their fervent religious beliefs or staunch dedication to enforcing justice in the realms. To these brothers and sisters in arms, evil had to be dealt with and could not be ignored.{{cite web | author= [[Wizards of the Coast]]  | title=Factions — Order of the Gauntlet | publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]] | date=2014 | work=What is D&D? | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208232119/http://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/story/faction/ordergauntlet | accessdate=2014-12-11 }}\n\nMembers of the order were strong in their faith, using it to stand against evil forces. as well as the Poet of Justice, [[Hoar]].",
        "Organization": "The Order of the Gauntlet had a number of chapters in various cities located across the western Realms of [[Faerûn]].",
        "Activities": {
            "Beliefs": "The Order of the Gauntlet held three tenets:\n* Faith was a member's most potent weapon against evil\n* Great challenges required heroic demonstrations of both strength and valor\n* It was justified to punish an act of evil, not a thought or feeling"
        },
        "Tactics": "[[File:Valiant Endeavor.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Knights of the Gauntlet undertaking a valiant endeavour]]\nThe order was clear on its methods of operation, and would never preemptively attack an opponent. They forewent the approval of local leadership when striking against evil.{{Cite dragon+/1/Player Factions: Our \"Heroes\"}} They would never punish someone who had not committed an evil act nor those who merely expressed immoral thoughts.\n\nIt was very uncommon to see a lone member of the Order as they almost always traveled in groups.",
        "Base of Operations": "In [[the North]], the Order of the Gauntlet maintained a strong presence in the city of [[Neverwinter]], several members stationed in [[Waterdeep]], and a representative in the [[Ten Towns]] city of [[Bryn Shander]].\n\nThe order was well-represented in the [[Western Heartlands]]. In the devout city of [[Elturel]], their chapterhouse operated out of the tavern known as [[A Pair of Black Antlers]].\n\nFar south in the land of [[Chult]], the Order first settled in [[Camp Righteous]] near a Chultan shrine, until it was taken over by undead creatures. They then established [[Camp Vengeance]] further up the river, near the [[Aldani Basin]].",
        "Possessions": "Members of the order were known to proudly display the [[holy symbol]]s of their respective deities.",
        "Relationships": "The Order of the Gauntlet counted a number of influential organizations among its allies. While they operated in very different ways, the [[Harpers]] and the Gauntlet ultimately shared the same goals for Faerûn.\n\nAs of the early 1490s, they sought to ally themselves with the [[Knights of Samular]] to conduct an allied campaign in the [[Savage Frontier]].",
        "History": "As of [[1489 DR]], the Order of the Gauntlet was considered one of the newest power groups in Faerûn.\n\nWhen the [[Cult of the Dragon]] began amassing vast stockpiles of treasure in the 1480s, the Order of the Gauntlet went to investigate. Working with the Harpers, they tracked a cult shipments across the [[Sword Coast]] to learn more about their far-reaching schemes. When the threat of the cult, and the summoning of [[Tiamat]] proved to required a coalition of power groups, the [[Council of Waterdeep]] was established. The order's delegate to the council was the [[Torm]]ar paladin of [[Elturel]], [[Ontharr Frume]].\n\nAt some point in the late 15{{th}} century DR, the order sent a 50-man expedition to Chult so as to rid the jungle of its [[undead]] infestation.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1491}}, the Order attempted to cultivate more political influence in the [[Sumber Hills]] region of the [[Dessarin Valley]]. They sought alliances with various local leaders, including the [[Waterbaron]] of [[Yartar]].",
