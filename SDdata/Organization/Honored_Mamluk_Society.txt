The Honored Mamluk Society, also known as the Honored, was a military organization in Zakhara.
This mamluk organization was tasked with protecting the Grand Caliph and his harim.
The Honored were led by General Ahmahd abd al-Iffa. Mamluks of the Honored were either eunuchs or women.
Since guarding the Grand Caliph was their priority, the Honored were based in Huzuz and actually rarely left the grounds of the Palace of the Enlightened Throne unless they were running errands.
