The '''Nine Council''' was the ruling body of government for the ancient and dead empire of [[Kadar]] in [[east Zakhara]].

==Organization==
The Nine Council was consisted of the nine most powerful [[geomancer]]s of Kadar. Each was given a title of their position with the strongest of these being the "Ninth of Nine" at the top of the hierarchy. Regardless of their rank, all members of the Nine Council were skilled practitioners of both [[arcane magic|arcane]] and [[divine magic]].

During the height of their power the Nine Council controlled the entire expanse of the [[Nogaro River]] valley. Though the empire of Kadar had long since crumbled as of [[1367 DR]]{{AQ-time}}, the [[geoglyph]]s they fashioned survived to the present day.

The Nine Council was ultimately destroyed or imprisoned by the [[Lions of Yesterday]].

==Members==
[[Tisan Balshareska]] was a notable member of the Nine Council who held the title Ninth of Nine. The other eight members of the Nine Council during the reign of Tisan were [[Wihda]], [[Ithnayn]], [[Thalath]], [[Arba']], [[Khlams]], [[Sitta]], [[Sab']], and [[Thimaanya]].
