Six elite noble efreeti were efreet pashas.
* Bazidan of the Flames
* Rashid al-Niran
* Sadiq the Smoky
* Hajjaj the Intemperate
* Umar al-Kushya of the Golden Brow

Each of the great pashas had other noble efreeti serving beneath him.
The efreet pashas loved hunting, and would spend many days running down prey of various kinds on their fiery chariots.
The efreet pashas preferred to have their strongholds located deep in the desert away from prying eyes, usually in ruins or abandoned locations. If discovered, they would move to a new location within one day.
