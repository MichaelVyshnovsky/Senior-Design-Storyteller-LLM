        "mainbody": "he Abolethic Sovereignty were the original aboleths of the Realms, who dwelt in the flying, obelisk-shaped city of Xxiphu, that existed since prehistoric times.\nThe main goal of the Abolethic Sovereignty was to unlock the Far Manifold with the Key of Stars and open the gate to the Far Realm to unleash their masters onto the world. They were also greatly interested in the Spellplague, and searched and studied active plaguelands across Faerûn.\nXxiphu was a mobile city, and that allowed the Abolethic Sovereignty to operate throughout all Faerûn. and in the Underdark below Neverwinter.\nBesides the dreaded Symphony of Madness,\nThe aboleths of the Abolethic Sovereignty were unlike the normal aboleths native to Toril. The aboleths of the Sovereignty were far older and had thought patterns different to those of the Torilian aboleths. Torilian aboleths usually avoided, or even opposed, aboleths of the Sovereignty. It was believed that aboleths of the Sovereignty were in fact the ancestors of the Torilian aboleths. \nThis was truer for the aboleths of the Sovereigntys cell working in Neverwinter, as exposure to the Spellplague had plaguechanged most of them, making them even more alien than the other aboleths of the Sovereignty. However, thanks to their plaguechanged condition, aboleths of the Neverwinter cell were more powerful than other aboleths.\nFor their covert operations, the Abolethic Sovereignty used the Symphony of Madness to control humanoids in subtle ways, making them excellent spies and sacrificial pawns without arousing suspicions in people around them. as well as plaguechanged creatures created during their experiments.\nThe Abolethic Sovereignty originally came to Abeir-Toril when the world was young, when Xxiphu plummeted to the world and settled deep below what is now the Sea of Fallen Stars. The oldest-known aboleth and possibly the progenitor of the entire species, the Eldest, was an enormous creature that rested atop the city like a throne. \nDuring the Spellplague of 1385 DR, Xxiphu was transported to Faerûn, and the members of the Abolethic Sovereignty took great interest in the world of Toril. Sensing the presence of Maegera below Gauntlgrym, the aboleths wanted to use the primordials power for their own ends.\nIn 1396 DR, Xxiphu was raised over the Sea of Fallen Stars and the Sovereignty compelled many kuo-toa tribes into their service. Shortly after its raising, Malyanna moved Xxiphu to the Citadel of the Outer Void on the fringe of the Feywild to open the gate to the Far Realm, but failed. \nIn 1429 DR, Xxiphu returned from the Citadel of the Outer Void to the sky above the Sea of Fallen Stars. Not long after, members of the Abolethic Sovereignty moved against Akanûl and destroyed the city of Brassune before the genasi could repel the aboleths. \nIn the following decades, a branch of the Abolethic Sovereignty became interested in a pocket of Spellplague in the Underdark below Neverwinter and began to use it to further the experiments that would aid them to create the Symphony of Madness.\nThe Ruining of Neverwinter in 1451 DR tore a giant chasm through the earth of the southeastern quadrant of the city. Reaching all the way to the depths of the Underdark, this rift opened wide to an underground lake where the Neverwintan cell of the Abolethic Sovereignty was experimenting on the plagueland located there. To the aboleths, the arrival the Shadovar–Thay War and the accompanying flurry of activity was a threat to their plans. They began to send minions to keep the other factions in the city busy while covering their own actions, using the succubus Arunika as one of their agents, until she was killed by an Oghman priest, Brother Anthus.\nIn the late 1470s DR,the succubus Rohini was sent to Neverwinter by the erinyes Invadiah to create conflict between the Sovereignty and the god Asmodeus. Her mission was to infiltrate the Oghman priesthood, to steal their methods to create spellscars, and spread false information to force the Sovereignty to attack the Nine Hells in a doomed crusade devised to either destroy or to enslave the aboleths. In 1478 DR, Rohini was able to seduce Brother Anthus,  infiltrating the Oghman faith successfully. She later killed Anthus in revenge for the death of her sister Arunika, earning the attention of the Sovereignty.\nUnfortunately for Rohini, Brother Vartan, a Sovereignty-corrupted priest, attempted to enslave her mind using a powerful relic known as the Hex Locus. Rohini was able to survive her contact with the Symphony of Madness and fused with the Hex Locus while maintaining her own free will. The aboleths convinced her that serving them was better than to serve Asmodeus, and that now that she had been fused with the Hex Locus she had a greater role in their plans. Rohini was reluctant at first, but eventually accepted to join the Sovereignty.\nAs of 1479 DR, the Abolethic Sovereignty was investing their efforts to thwart the New Neverwinter movement or to use it to advance their own agenda.\n* The Eldest\n* ADrxl\n* Chartilifax\n* Malyanna\n* Rohini\n* Soman Galt"
