The '''Scything Claw''' tribe was a [[kobold]] nest that resided in the [[Aphrunn Mountains]] on the southern border of [[Turmish]] in the [[Vilhon Reach]].

==Organization==
The Scything Claw nest was numbered at approximately 700 kobolds with around 250 females and children. The tribe's military force excluded the females and youths, numbering at 450 warriors.

==Activities==
By [[1358 DR]], the Scrying Claw had been under leadership of Chief [[Greshlyrr]] for a decade. The chieftain was a cruel, strong, individual who enjoyed seeing others suffer, but he felt responsible for the kobolds under his leadership. The nest flourished under Greshlyrr's rule, reaching levels of civilization rare among kobolds. [[Kurtulmak]]-fearing kobolds of the Scrying Claw were convinced that Greshlyrr bore blessing of the deity and followed his lead with devotion.

Greshlyrr forged a truce between his tribe and the town of [[Gildenglade]] following several years of fruitless skirmishes.

==History==
In the {{YearlinkName|1358}}, a group of [[adventurer]]s by chance stumbled into a lair of the kobold Scything Claw tribe. The lair was poorly defended at the time due to an ongoing raid into [[goblin]] territories. The adventurers defeated the guards and looted the kobolds' treasures. Unbeknownst to the adventurers, the town of Gildenglade had a truce with the Scything Claw tribe that had been in place for many years. The truce was a challenging achievement after Gildenglade and the kobolds spent years on skirmishes and attacks against each other. Gildenglade ordered the adventurers to return the loot in fear of a war with chief Greshlyrr's kobolds. However, Scything Claw tribe thought the raid was a grave offense, and Greshlyrr led an assault on the town of Gildenglade.

As of the {{YearlinkName|1370}}, the Scything Claw remained a nuisance for [[Turmish]]'s militia. On occasion, the tribe's kobolds helmed raids on Turmishan settlements and clashed with town defenses.
