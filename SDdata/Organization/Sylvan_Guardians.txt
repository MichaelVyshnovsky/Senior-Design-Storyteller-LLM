The '''Sylvan Guardians''' was a group of [[centaur]]s living in the forests of [[Shadowdale]]. They were generally standoffish with visitors, but helpful with anyone whose goals aligned with their own.

==History==
Some time during the year [[1369 DR]] the centaurs went hunting for a group of [[goblin]]s that plundered their home glade. This was most likely the raiding [[Broken Bones clan]]s.
