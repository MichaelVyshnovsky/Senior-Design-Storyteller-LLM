They did not war with the dwarves of Shanatar, but they maintained control of the Mir region.\nThe bakkals palace was located in the city of Calimport.\nThe Pahlemn Dynasty succeeded the previous Marekh Dynasty in , after the former dynastys rulers all died from the Sunset Plague. The Pahlemns ruled for an unprecedented 421 years, ending in  with the rise of the warlike Tavihr Dynasty.\nOne of the sabbans in the city of Calimport was named after this dynasty, Pahlemn Sabban in Caravan Ward."
