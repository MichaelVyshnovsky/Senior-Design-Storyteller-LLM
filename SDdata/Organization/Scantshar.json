This was largely due to the fact that the family matriarch, Riliyyn Scantshar, was a wizard of some accomplishment.\nAs one of the more prominent families, the Scantshars also contributed a member to the council of elders that governed Sevenecho, around 1369 DR.Given her seniority and authority, Riliyyn Scantshar may be this member of this council of elders.\n*Riliyyn Scantshar"
