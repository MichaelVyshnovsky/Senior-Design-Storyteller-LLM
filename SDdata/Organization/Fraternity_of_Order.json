        "Organization": "The Guvners' philosophy was centered about discovering and cataloging the laws of the multiverse. According to the faction, laws governed everything. At the same time, all laws had loopholes which could be discovered and exploited. These loopholes were, according to them, the secret to true power.\n\nThe faction's [[Factol]] was [[Hashkar]], a [[petitioner]] of Sigil and rumored to be a worshiper of the Lady of Pain herself.",

How can you find such finely tuned and well-organized bureaucracy ''boring''?\n}}\nThe faction ran the court system of Sigil, acting as the city's judiciary system and as advocates. They were also the most active and powerful faction in the [[gate-town]] of [[Automata]] in the [[Outlands]], where they filled the majority of official bureaucratic posts.\n\nTheir planar research involved not only collecting lore, but also conducting experiments and retrieving antiquities that could help them understand the inner workings of natural laws. It was common for the Guvners to hire guards and guides into the most dangerous planes.\n\nAmong the cataloging activities of the faction was the counting and numbering of the [[Layers of the Abyss]]. According to their records in Sigil, they had encountered 679 layers, of which 141 were considered habitable.",
        "Base of Operations": "The base of operation of the Fraternity of Order was the [[City Court]] of Sigil between the [[Great Upheaval]] and the [[Faction War (conflict)|Faction War]]. Following the dismantling of all factions by the [[Lady of Pain]] in the aftermath of the latter conflict, the Guvners moved their operations to a stronghold in the [[Fortress of Disciplined Enlightment]] in Mechanus.{{Cite comic/Evil at Baldur's Gate 3}}",

        "History": "The Guvners claimed to be the oldest faction of Sigil, and the first faction to create a charter.\n\n632 years after the Great Upheaval, in the 130{{th}} year of Factol Hashkar's leadership, the Faction War started. Amidst the confusion, Hashkar was assassinated by a released prisoner who had sworn vengeance against him. The Guvners immediately blamed the Xaositects for the murder and joined the conflict, siding with the Mercykillers, the Harmonium, the [[Society of Sensation]], and the [[Sign of One]] against the coalition formed by the Xaositects and the Doomguard.\n\n[[File:Fraternity Judge.png|thumb|right|350px|A judge of the Fraternity of Order issuing judgement ''circa'' the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]].]]\nIn the aftermath of the war, when the Lady of Pain outlawed the power structures of all factions present in Sigil, the Guvners moved their operations to Mechanus, where they regrouped in the hope of one day returning to the City of Doors.\n\nIn their exile, the leaderless faction continued on their experiments to understand natural laws. Their plan to one day return to Sigil revolved around their perception that the city ultimately held all the keys for complete understanding.\n\nIn the late 15{{th}} century [[DR]], the [[wild mage]] [[Delina]] was sent to Mechanus by [[Martikay]] in order to search for a way to cure her from her wild magic surges. After interacting with several modrons, she was brought to trial by the Fraternity of Order at Regulus under charges of being an agent of [[chaos]]. She was found guilty and summarily sentenced to exile from the plane, upon penalty of larger fines.",
        "Members": "Members of the Fraternity of Order were typically referred to as \"guvners\". The faction always looked for  intelligent candidates who could memorize large amounts of lore and laws and passed their admission tests. The training obtained from the faction allowed members to quickly learn new languages and lore, as they slowly learned to explore the laws of the multiverse."
