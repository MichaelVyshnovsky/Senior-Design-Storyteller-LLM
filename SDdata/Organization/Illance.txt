'''House Illance''' was a noble house of [[Cormyr]] based in [[Suzail]].

==Holdings==
Although the family was based in Suzail, it had deep roots in [[Marsember]] and owned many properties through a complicated web of small companies bearing the names of others. The family owned a palatial home in Marsember known as "Iyrinthorn",<ref>{{cite web

==Reputation==
The family's menfolk were notorious womanizers and were frequent patrons of [[Mask Dance]] clubs.{{Cite dungeon/198/Backdrop: Suzail}} The family was involved in some illicit dealings,

The House was an enemy of the [[Cormaeril|House Cormaeril]].

==History==
Some members of the family plotted with [[Luthax]] against King [[Draxius]] in the {{YearlinkName|629}}.<ref>

Several unnamed members fought with King [[Galaghard III]] against the Witch-Lords in the {{YearlinkName|900}}.<ref>

House Illance was among those who fought with [[Arangor]] and King [[Azoun II]] against the [[dragon]] [[Thauglor]] in the {{YearlinkName|1018}}, where one of their houses in Suzail was destroyed.

House Illance slowly lost influence at the Royal Court over generations, and weak family leaders poorly managed and invested the family fortune, but the family was never in ruin.<ref>

By [[1479 DR]], the family's fortunes had improved through deals with the [[Seven Suns|Seven Suns Trading Company]].
