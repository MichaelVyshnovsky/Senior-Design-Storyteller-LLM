        "Organization": "House Mestel was one of the oldest and most powerful merchant families of Arrabar. The oldest families held nine-tenth of the city's wealth while the younger merchant houses, such as [[House Matrell]], fought for the one-tenth share of the market. The estate of the Mestel family was a sprawling high-spired mansion surrounded by a grove of [[suth]] trees planted along the estate's perimeter. Like all other mercantile houses of Arrabar, Mestels housed a sizable mercenary and guard force.",
        "History": "[[Obiron Matrell]] was born in the {{YearlinkName|1292}} to one of the lordlings of the great Mestel family of Arrabar. Mestels denounced the distant-born bastard and left him no choice but to change his name and establish his own merchant organization â€“ House Matrell. Even after Obiron, along with his wife [[Hetta Matrell|Hetta]], built a small merchant empire, House Matrell was still looked down upon by Mestels.\n\nIn the {{YearlinkName|1373}}, [[Falagh Mestel]] became involved in a plot against House Matrell."
