The Lion Tribe were one of the major roaming tribes of the Shaar. Their territory consisted of the plains ranging from Lake Lhespen to the Landrise, south of the River Shaar.
Raiders of the Lion Tribe were known for charging their foes and making a frenzy of slashing attacks, similar to the animal from which they took their name.
