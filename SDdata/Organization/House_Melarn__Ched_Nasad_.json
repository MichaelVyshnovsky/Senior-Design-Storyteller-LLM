        "mainbody": "'''House Melarn''' was a [[drow]] house in [[Ched Nasad]] that fell with the destruction of Ched Nasad during the [[Silence of Lolth]]  in the {{YearlinkName|1372}}.",
        "House": "House Melarn's compound was a huge cyst-like bulge on the second-highest level of the city.\n\nThe waiting room at House Melarn was covered in statues and frescos with motifs of spiders, webs, drow, and musical instruments. There was a broken bust of [[Mathira Melarn]] in House Melarn's great hall.",
        "Activities": "House Melarn and [[House Baenre]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] owned the [[Black Claw Mercantile Company]], whose storehouses were operated by [[House Zauvirr]].\n\nHouse Melarn had a secret family tradition: chosen females studied ''[[bae'qeshel]]'' bardic magic to become \"dark minstrels.\"",
        "History": "Prior to its fall, House Melarn had stood for twenty centuries or more.\n\nIn 1372 DR, Matron Mother [[Ssipriina Zauvirr]] hired the [[duergar]] mercenary band [[Clan Xornbane]] to assist in an attempt to destroy House Melarn. Ssipriina took over the Black Claw storehouses, killing Matron Mother [[Drisinil Melarn]]. Unfortunately, Clan Xornbane was given the direction to attack House Melarn prematurely, destroying the house with [[stonefire]] bombs and causing it to collapse into the city cavern. This contributed to overall chaos in the city, which (as part of a [[Jaezred Chaulssin]] plot directed by [[Zammzt]]) rapidly destroyed itself.\n\nSometime in [[1366 DR|1366]] or [[1377 DR]], [[Q'arlynd Melarn]] discovered that the sigil of House Melarn, which resembled a dancing stick figure, was in fact a crude depiction of [[Eilistraee]], and showed that some of the drow that remained were free from the Taint of [[Wendonai]] and still had in them a speck of good.",
        "Members": "* [[Drisinil Melarn]]: The last [[matron mother]] of the house, who was murdered by [[Clan Xornbane]] in 1372 DR just before the fall of Ched Nasad.\n* [[Jawil Melarn]]: Halisstra's sister. At one point, Halisstra's sister Jawil pushed her off a ledge after Halisstra won a race. Halisstra later killed after Jawil made an attempt on her life.\n* [[Halisstra Melarn]]: First Daughter of House Melarn, who escaped the destruction with Ched Nasad and joined with [[Quenthel Baenre]] to investigate the [[Silence of Lolth]].<ref> She eventually became [[Lolth]]'s [[Lady Penitent]].<ref>\n* [[Mathira Melarn]]: Sword Dancer of [[Eilistraee]]. She wielded the [[Crescent Blade]] until her death on the [[Cold Field]], where she remained as a ghost until she passed the blade on to Halisstra in 1372 DR.\n* [[Norendia Melarn]]: Halisstra's sister, who killed Halisstra's bard tutor and whom Halisstra killed.\n* [[Tellik Melarn]]: A male of House Melarn in the years immediately before the city fell, who was sacrificed for worshiping [[Vhaeraun]].<ref>\n* [[Q'arlynd Melarn]]: The last house wizard. He survived the fall of [[Ched Nasad]]<ref> and eventually redeemed himself and was freed of the taint of Wendonai and became a [[dark elf]].\n* [[Danifae Yauntyrr]]: A battle-captive from [[Eryndlyn]]. She was not truly a member of the house, but she served Halisstra."
