        "mainbody": "'''Guild of Trusted Pewterers and Casters''' was one of the registered [[Guilds of Waterdeep|guilds]] of the city of [[Waterdeep]], specializing in the casting of metal items.<ref>",
        "Organization": "The symbol of this guild depicted their two most popular products, a [[bell]] and a [[tankard]]. The tankard was depicted as a green silhouette, with its handle to the right of the viewer, and situated beneath the bell.\n\nThe initial fee for entrance to the guild was 20 [[gold piece]]s. Afterwards, guild members had to pay a monthly due of a single gold piece.",
        "Activities": "The members of this guild casted and sold a wide range of products. Their most popular were bells and tankard, followed closely by [[book]]s and [[bowl]]s. They rarely ever worked with precious metals, such as [[gold]], preferring to leave such work to other more appropriate guilds in Waterdeep, such as the [[Jewelers' Guild]].\n\nIn addition to their normal activities, members of the guild were willing and able to conduct exchanges of other currencies into Waterdhavian [[coinage]]. They had a reputation for having reliable [[merchant's scale]]s and guild-wide rates of exchange.<ref>",
        "Tactics": "The Guild bought the raw materials to form its own basic [[pewter]] mixture, which it then sold to all its members in the form of a bar, at a cheap rate of 1 [[copper piece]] per instance. These bars measured {{SI|1|ft|long=yes}} in length and {{SI|3|in|long=yes}} in both height and width. This mixture was the basis for all castings conducted by guild members, though guildsmen always liked to add their own \"secret ingredients\" to their castings in order to further refine the quality of their products.\n\nThe Guild's its title of \"trusted\" referred to its common policy of discreteness. Guild members would melt down objects and re-casting them without badgering their clients with any sort of inquiries or comments.",
        "Base of Operations": "The guildhall for this guild was the [[Pewterers' and Casters' Guildhall]], located along the [[High Road (Waterdeep)|High Road]] in the city's [[Waterdeep/Castle Ward|Castle Ward]].",
        "Possessions": "The standard uniform of a members of the Pewterers and Casters guild was a white, sleeveless [[surcoat]] and [[apron]] with the guild's livery emblazoned upon it.",
        "Members": "This guild had a total of over 400 members by 1357 DR, an amount that remained consistent well into 1368 DR. During the mid-14{{th}} century [[DR]] their guild leader was High Artisan [[Dunbold Laraeikan]] and their Voice, the guild's public contact, was [[Baerhar Surtlan]].<ref>"
