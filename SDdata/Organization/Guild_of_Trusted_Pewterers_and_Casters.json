        "mainbody": "Guild of Trusted Pewterers and Casters was one of the registered guilds of the city of Waterdeep, specializing in the casting of metal items.\nThe symbol of this guild depicted their two most popular products, a bell and a tankard. The tankard was depicted as a green silhouette, with its handle to the right of the viewer, and situated beneath the bell.\nThe initial fee for entrance to the guild was 20 gold pieces. Afterwards, guild members had to pay a monthly due of a single gold piece.\nThe members of this guild casted and sold a wide range of products. Their most popular were bells and tankard, followed closely by books and bowls. They rarely ever worked with precious metals, such as gold, preferring to leave such work to other more appropriate guilds in Waterdeep, such as the Jewelers Guild.\nIn addition to their normal activities, members of the guild were willing and able to conduct exchanges of other currencies into Waterdhavian coinage. They had a reputation for having reliable merchants scales and guild-wide rates of exchange.\nThe Guild bought the raw materials to form its own basic pewter mixture, which it then sold to all its members in the form of a bar, at a cheap rate of 1 copper piece per instance. These bars measured  in length and  in both height and width. This mixture was the basis for all castings conducted by guild members, though guildsmen always liked to add their own \"secret ingredients\" to their castings in order to further refine the quality of their products.\nThe Guilds its title of \"trusted\" referred to its common policy of discreteness. Guild members would melt down objects and re-casting them without badgering their clients with any sort of inquiries or comments.\nThe guildhall for this guild was the Pewterers and Casters Guildhall, located along the High Road in the citys Castle Ward.\nThe standard uniform of a members of the Pewterers and Casters guild was a white, sleeveless surcoat and apron with the guilds livery emblazoned upon it.\nThis guild had a total of over 400 members by 1357 DR, an amount that remained consistent well into 1368 DR. During the mid-14 century DR their guild leader was High Artisan Dunbold Laraeikan and their Voice, the guilds public contact, was Baerhar Surtlan."
