'''Talisid and the Five Companions''' referred to a group of of [[guardinal]] [[celestial paragon|paragons]] who protected the [[Cosmology|plane]] known as the [[House of Nature]], much like a party of [[adventurer]]s. They wandered the [[House of Nature]] and smashed any evil creatures that threatened the [[plane]]. The guardinals always existed here as far as anyone knew, and the companions had always solved disputes and led [[celestial]] warriors into battle. Members of the group retired once they deemed themselves unfit for service, but Talisid had been around for so long, hardly anyone could remember the name of the group's former leader. Occasionally, members of the group argued, but they did so as the dearest of friends with a loyalty to each other that put mere family loyalty to shame.
