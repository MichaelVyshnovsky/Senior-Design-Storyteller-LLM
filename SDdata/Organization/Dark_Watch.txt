The Dark Watch was a mercenary company based in the Orsraun Mountains and active in the Sea of Fallen Stars region.
The company was a group of archers mounted on hippogriffs.
Usually the Dark Watch worked for pirate gangs who wanted to destroy another pirate group.
These mercenaries fought with longswords and longbows.
Around 1357 DR, they fought on the losing side during the war against the arcanaloth Yrkhetep. During the Battle of Five Crowns, the original leader of the Dark Watch, Thurindar Pelamar, was killed by a member of the Sunshafts.
Their leader Lothar Pelamar was the brother of Thurindar.
The Dark Watch charged their employers a daily salary of 100 gold pieces.
