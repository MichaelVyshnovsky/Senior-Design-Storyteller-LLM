        "mainbody": "he Astorians were the dominant thieves guild in the city of Teziir as of 1359 DR. \nTheir primary activities revolved around petty theft protection services, with goods often being offered as \"tithes.\" The Council of Teziir wished to diminish the Astorians influence within the city, but they simply could not afford the services required to do so effectively.\nThe Astorians numbered nearly 700 members in 1359 DR and they were growing rapidly. Many believed the Astorians would end up ruling Teziir within a generation or two."
