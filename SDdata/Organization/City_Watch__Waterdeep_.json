        "Tactics": "When within the walls of Waterdeep, the City Watch typically patrolled in groups of four, with two patrolmen, one armar, and one civilar.\n\nIn calmer districts such as the [[Castle Ward of Waterdeep|Castle Ward]], those detachments were even smaller, often consisting of only two officers. Conversely, locations such as the [[Dock Ward of Waterdeep|Dock Ward]] were patrolled by groups of eight during the day and twelve at night.\n\nMany spellcasters within the City Watch were trained in the use of the spell ''[[trembling horn]]'', which was developed for the organization by [[Thyriellentha Snome|Thyri Snome]]. It allowed watchmen place an invisible, magical tracer that caused alarm-like effects that were widely recognizable among the Waterdhavian populace.",
        "Base of Operations": "The Watch's main base of operations was the [[Palace of Waterdeep]].\n\nThere were multiple City Watch posts in Waterdeep. They were usually not located on the main streets, but were all identified by a green and gold lantern that hung outside, permanently lit by a ''[[continual flame]]'' [[spell]]. These posts served as local headquarters, armories, stations for people to report crimes, and temporary jailhouses to hold prisoners until they were moved to a courthouse. Watch stations were always led by a captain.",
        "Possessions": "[[File:Badge_of_the_watch-5e.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''A  captain's ''[[badge of the Watch]]''.'']]\nMembers of the City Watch typically wore [[leather armor|leather]] and [[chain mail|chain armor]] and carried sturdy rods like [[club]]s, [[short sword]]s, and [[dagger]]s.\n\nIn the 14{{th}} century [[DR]], City Watch captains carried an ''[[amulet of the Watch]]'', a [[magic item]] that allowed the wearer to summon reinforcements from the Watch or from the [[City Guard (Waterdeep)|City Guard]]. In the 15{{th}} century DR, officers who achieved the rank of captain were awarded a ''[[badge of the Watch]]'', a magic item that provided the wearer with additional protection against attacks and allowed the [[Open Lord]] to immediately know the wearer's location. Only the Open Lord could award ''badges of the Watch''.\n\nIn the late 14{{th}} century DR, some of the members of the Watch were given fashionable-looking ''[[cloak of protection versus evil|cloaks of protection versus evil]]'' by [[Khelben Arunsun]] and one of his apprentices who later opened his own shop that sold similar magic [[cloak]]s.",
