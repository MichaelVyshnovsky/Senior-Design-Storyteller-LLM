        "mainbody": "The City Watch of Waterdeep served as the police force within the city.\nThe Watchs purpose was not only to enforce the law, but also to ensure the well-being of Waterdhavians.\nIt had a centralized command led by the Commander of the Watch, who supervised three watchlords, or senior commanders the Mage Civilar in charge of the wizard corps the Senior Armsmaster, who was in charge of supplies and reported directly to the Commander of the Watch and the Grand Civilar, who commanded the ward civilars and held the same rank as the Mage Civilar. The Commander of the Watch reported directly to the Open Lord.\nEach ward of Waterdeep was patrolled by a division of the Watch under the command of a ward civilar, or major, who oversaw all the senior civilars commanding the watch stations of their respective wards.\n----\nSenior CommandersGrand Civilar • Mage Civilar • Senior Armsmaster\n----\nCommander of the Watch\nEach guard post was commanded by a senior civilar or captain, sometimes referred to as a rorden, who commanded a number of patrols. Senior civilars also performed duties as orsars, acting as envoys and prisoner escorts and as guardswords, in charge of patrolling the docks and gates.\nEach patrol was headed by a civilar, or lieutenant, Typical patrol groups included one armar, or sergeant, also known as a \"sword\", and two or more constables, also known as \"blades\" or watchmen/watchwomen.\nthumb|300px|right|A traffic warden gives directions at the corner of Delzorin Street and Whaelgond Way.\nThe City Watch performed everyday policing duties. They never acted outside the walls of the city They were a peacekeeping force, also responsible for solving crimes and apprehending criminals.\nDuring particularly busy hours at important intersections, the Watch also employed traffic wardens to manage the flow of people and vehicles. Traffic wardens carried two flags one blue, which signaled for traffic to proceed, and one yellow, which signaled for it to stop. They also employed whistles to call the attention of passersby, if necessary.\nWhen within the walls of Waterdeep, the City Watch typically patrolled in groups of four, with two patrolmen, one armar, and one civilar.\nIn calmer districts such as the Castle Ward, those detachments were even smaller, often consisting of only two officers. Conversely, locations such as the Dock Ward were patrolled by groups of eight during the day and twelve at night.\nMany spellcasters within the City Watch were trained in the use of the spell trembling horn, which was developed for the organization by Thyri Snome. It allowed watchmen place an invisible, magical tracer that caused alarm-like effects that were widely recognizable among the Waterdhavian populace.\nThe Watchs main base of operations was the Palace of Waterdeep.\nThere were multiple City Watch posts in Waterdeep. They were usually not located on the main streets, but were all identified by a green and gold lantern that hung outside, permanently lit by a continual flame spell. These posts served as local headquarters, armories, stations for people to report crimes, and temporary jailhouses to hold prisoners until they were moved to a courthouse. Watch stations were always led by a captain.\nthumb|200px|right|A  captains badge of the Watch.\nMembers of the City Watch typically wore leather and chain armor and carried sturdy rods like clubs, short swords, and daggers.\nIn the 14 century DR, City Watch captains carried an amulet of the Watch, a magic item that allowed the wearer to summon reinforcements from the Watch or from the City Guard. In the 15 century DR, officers who achieved the rank of captain were awarded a badge of the Watch, a magic item that provided the wearer with additional protection against attacks and allowed the Open Lord to immediately know the wearers location. Only the Open Lord could award badges of the Watch.\nIn the late 14 century DR, some of the members of the Watch were given fashionable-looking cloaks of protection versus evil by Khelben Arunsun and one of his apprentices who later opened his own shop that sold similar magic cloaks.\nBy 1479 DR, the City Guard had been folded into the Watch, becoming a division of its organization. As the Guard was better equipped and trained, particularly dangerous tasks inside Waterdeep were given to the Guard instead, such as patrolling the sewers and Undermountain.\nthumb|250px|Mergen Truff, Orvis Torval, and Rosko Bosh.\n* Brace Ulmemur former adventurer turned City Watchmen circa 1372 DR\n* Derek Windsfire was The Grand Civilar in command of the seven ward civilars circa 1372 DR\n* Emmer Jundhyl was a watch civilar of the North Ward circa 1372 DR\n* Jauslo was a watch civilar who was in charge of the baby griffon recovery for Laeral Silverhand circa 1490s DR.\n* Helve Urtrace was the Senior Armsmaster circa 1372 DR\n* Captain Hyustus Staget circa 1492 DR\n* Mulgor of Tyr was a collector-of-fees circa 1372 DR\n* Ilph was the Senior Skulk of the Castle Ward circa 1372 DR\n* Captain Jalester Silvermane circa 1492 DR\n* Olophin yn Zelmazzar was a senior civilar of the Trades Ward circa 1372 DR\n* Captain Rulathon was the Commander of the Watch circa 1372 DR\n* Sergeant Saeth Cromley was retired, but sometimes helped with investigations\n* Thyriellentha Snome was the Mage Civilar circa 1372 DR\n* Mergen Truff, Orvis Torval, and Rosko Bosh, a detachment of the Watch sent to guard the remains of the Jollys Lamp Emporium warehouse in the Dock Ward in ."
